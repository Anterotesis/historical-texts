         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

other.</p>
            <p>VVhat (I say) with these obstructions <hi>Partly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and
some other also of another nature, I have been forced inevitably to presse your
patience (Dear Friends) almost to death: wherupon I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge you
notwithstanding to forbear Murmurring and acting in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>uch sullennesse, as, because the
book came out no sooner, therupon to neglect it altogether: if my paines may
not abate his displeasure, and ballance his patience, who is offended without a
cause, for not hasting it out by the halves, as some (for ought I see) had
ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I should have done, then tarried till I had done the tenth of what I
intended. I desire that man, who ever he is, either to fry still in the fire of
his own fretfull humour, or else to please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, when he sees Good, without
amends from me, who having disposed of this, thats out, to the publique service
as soon as I could well do it acceptably to God, whose providence hath hitherto
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me, dare not disparage his acceptance of me so much, as, in what I
have it, to ask forgivenesse from men:</p>
            <p>Its never long that comes at last, if withall it effect that in
order to which it comes, and if you say, <hi>Bis, qui cito,</hi> he does
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that dispatches, I say <hi>Sat cito, si sat bene,</hi> soon enough, if
well enough, or else too soon even yet: whether this present Bulk doth performe
its errand so well or no, as to be worth your waiting so long for it, Its not
for me to determine; I leave it to your strictest examination, regardlesse
utterly of any censure, whether yours, or theirs, to whom it beares strictest
Relation, my business in it lying more with God, then either them, or you; wel
knowing that he, who spends himself in thoughts of what others think of him
&amp; his, hath more pride then wit, and more time then grace and wisdome to
improve it, let the work therefore stand or fall to its own Master, Ile neither
beg any mans good word for <pb facs="tcp:42067:4"/> it, nor put it under any patronage, but
Christs, from whom it came to me, and to whom together with all honour, thanks
and praise for his assistance of me most unworthy creature in it I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate it
back again. If any quarrel with the length of it now it is come, as some do in
that it was so long ere it came, and ask why I have laid such a large and
voluminous siege to so small and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial a fort, such poor paper works, as
might have been battered and taken in much lesse time, and with a far lesse
train of Artillery then is here brought against the <hi>Ashford</hi>
Disputation? I desire them to understand, that howbeit the daring defiance
thereof engaged me to make my first onset upon that petty Garrison, so that
there is as it were a vein of dispute therewith continuing, and running (for
the most part) throwout the whole Volume; yet the battle is also with the main
body of their worthies (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) according as <hi>(inter
pregnandum)</hi> they have occasionally bin accessary to their relief.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Possession is eleven points of the twelve, in which
respect, they being but defendants, and we now indeed (as they say page the
first) invading, or rather re-invading (for they at first by their own
invention brought innovation, and invasion upon the truth) both them and the
practise of their Church in the point of infant sprinkling, which are both
prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possed already of all Christendome, and have now of a long time planted,
seated, and settled themselves so firmly in the dark Cells of mens in most
consciences and affections, that it hath been and is not onely hatefull, but
hazardous for any to storm them out, we go upon no small disadvantages, and so
had need be more free of our shot then else we should be; <hi>Intus existens
facile prohibet alienum,</hi> a few within the walls may be a match to many
that are yet without, how much more when the stormed are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to one of those
that storm them, even four hundred and fifty of the rest to few of the Lords
<hi>Elijahs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, An ell too long is better than an inch too short: he that
likes not the length hath enough of the same to make it shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to himself
when he pleases, and liberty from the Authour to look into as little of it as
he lists.</p>
            <p>Fourthly if you find it not greater in quantity then in quality
advantagious to the truth, it may welcome it self into reasonable mens
affections, when such a short shuffle as that it relates to, may, without
injury, be shut out of doors.</p>
            <p>If the title of it chance to trouble <hi>Any body,</hi> that shall
not at all trouble me: for though the <hi>Ashford</hi> disputation, which it
main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answers to, was assuredly penned by <hi>Some Body,</hi> yet <hi>No
Body</hi> is pleased to own it, and therefore to him, even to <hi>No body,</hi>
it was most meet to superscribe the answer.</p>
            <p>In a word, and to conclude (for it were an unreasonable 
<pb facs="tcp:42067:4"/> thing, &amp; no less then to set my self upon a new score by
wiping out the old one, if while I am excusing my self for detaining the book
so long from you, I should detain you long from the book it self, now it is
out, by a long Epistle) what ere tis, here tis, if <hi>Every Body</hi> be free
from the guilt of those errors and He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

had slept long enough, if your private letters had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned them by a too
much slighting your opponents and their arguments. I know you have seen the
thing long since, and heard the other day you intended a Uindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The
last Thursday there was a conference at</hi> Wadhurst <hi>in</hi> Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex
<hi>upon the like subject, where were more then one of your Opponents at</hi>
Ashford. <hi>This relation was objected to them among other things, as a
Pamphlet injurious to your self, as neither setting down your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers truly,
nor fully. This puts the Publisher upon a further work. Not an new thing upon
the subject, but a desire of you (if you give not the cause by your silence
upon this</hi> Provocation) <hi>to let something be seen in your own right, by
which he may take occasion to clear himself about the publishing of this. To
that purpose I was intreated to send you this Copy; that you may not take
advantage of those many faults, which through the negligence of the</hi>
Printer <hi>are found in your former. Sir, I pray deal clearly and ingenuously,
for you deal with such as your self in this, that their aim is onely Gods
glory, and the discharge of their own consciences in vindication of the truth,
suppressing heresie, reducing those who are gone, confirming those who are
doubtful, and praying that God would give the assistance of his spirit to these
ends. So rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi>

did, and but one letter wherein I did at all make mention of your doings: If
that be it (as no doubt it is) you were so exceptious at, as thereupon to
betake your selves to vindication in so publike a way as the press, one would
think you should have excepted, and acted principally in print against such
matters in that my letter, as are of more generall and publique concernment, as
lay the Ax to the root of your <pb facs="tcp:42067:6"/> tree, as strike at the very

               </gap>so to the <hi>Reader,</hi> where you

               </gap>nted, that he who spake so
diminutively of you and yours, must needs be ashamed that his words should ever
see the light; you know Sirs that my letter was not so private, but that it
might have been made publique (if yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

so both had it amongst you, and free leave also from me (of whom if you had had

               </gap> it) to have prest it out in your service, with your
own defence against it, the presse being also as open to your excusation, as my
accusation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If you ask me why, I reply not to the sole publisher of
the Account, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse my self in way of blame to you all, even such as
were no more then present at the disputation. I answer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. How to personate the chief publisher of your collections
I knew not, for I know him not: or if I know him well enough for my self, yet I
know not how to know him so well, as on my knowledge to notific him to others:
he hath chosen to be namelesse, whether to this end that he might be the more
securely shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less in setting down orno, I will not say at any hand, but many
a one will think so for all that: for my part since I saw it pleased him to
hide himself, I was not disposed much to enquire after him, much l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sse shall he be dicovered for me, who
can tell, from the time I first saw his work, whose finger it is not, more
safely then I can yet, whose it is: for in such sense as some Scripture is, its
doubtlesse no singer of God, and though I am sure tis the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <pb facs="tcp:42067:6"/>
of meer man, assisted by Satan, yet of what man in special, (I confesse I have
good ground to pay it with thinking) I may not speak positively in print,
unlesse Ile speak upon bare hearsay, which I heed not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if it were mainly the employment of one to gather things
together, &amp; compose them into one bulk, yet it seems plainly to be the
joint issue of several mens brains, and to have been rak't out of more memories
then one, and therefore well may you call them <hi>Collections,</hi> yea that
not meerly one, but more then one had a hand in it, I am informed sufficiently
to belief by the voice of the Baby-book it self, which speaking in some places
plurally, but not any where singularly of its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, little lesse then
assures me of this, that howbeit there might be one prime penman of the
Pamphlet, or whoere it was that thrust it through the presse, yet the minds of
more men, yea more Ministers then one is sounded forth in it, yea of such as
were but Auditors at the Disputation, whose sense both of it, and of its
efficacy upon the people is said in your Account to be so unanimous, that they
resolved together with the rest to declare their sense of it in their several
congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and oppose the growth of Anabaptism, as tis cal'd, in their
respective flocks, which since it hath been done by them too, accordingly as
was then agreed, whether if not all, or at lest a plurality of those Priests,

any of you can clear your selves of it do) then I can clear any of you of at
all, save the Scotchman of <hi>Kenington,</hi> who at <hi>Folston</hi>
disclaimed his having any hand in it: But should that be more then I have
warrand to be sure of, yet however I am certain of this, that either it is the

so curiously composed, that it may seem to be the Ministers book, and the
Arguments that are set down in it, be they never so silly and inconsequent, are
fathored upon you all in grosse, recorded as the <hi>Ministers</hi> arguments,
though proceeding but from one <hi>Ministers</hi> mouth, and not few follies
and absurd things, whilst the Penman dances in the clouds himself, are related
as spoken, and done by the Ministers, which the Ministers may very well, and
will once find time to be ashamed of: yet you seem to take all thats put upon
you to your selves, not any of you entring your dissent: whilst therefore you
seem so jointly to justifie him, that puts you all upon the score in the

thing you have thrust forth, I am experienced by your wonted Demeanor toward
such as trouble you too much with truth, how much more <hi>Odium</hi> then ever
I must come under there by among both your selves and your Admirers; but
<hi>hic murus ahaeneus esto nil conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa.</hi>
This verily is no lesse then a Brazen fence to me against all your censures and
exceptions, that even herein, as well as in in other things for which you
condemn me, I have exercised my self so, as to keep a conscience void of
offence, and that toward both God and man. Yea if I have not dealt clearly, as
you wish me to do, i. e. according as the truth is indeed, then in the very way
of waiting upon God onely, singly, seriously, and with many tears for the
understanding of it, in which way he, that cannot lie, hath assured me he will
be found, my conscience is most wonderfully clouded; therefore see that you
see, if you see.</p>
            <p>But if I have not dealt ingenuously i. e. as candidly as so
crooked a generation as the CCClergy is, that do alwayes erre in their hearts,
and have not known Christs wayes, can justly claim from any, but some Cowardly
Clawback, that cares not to be unfaithful in his carriage both toward God and
them, then the Lord deal so graciously with us all, as to humble both you under
a sanctified sight of such sins as you are as truly guilty of, as here reproved
for, and me under my miscarriage in reproving.</p>

<hi>Account</hi> it self) I will begin with your book, which (as diminutive as
it is) you have for all that stitcht up in no less than three Treatises.</p>
            <list>
               <item>First, A <hi>Report</hi> of your <hi>Disputation.</hi>
               </item>

            <p>In all which, how far forth you quit your selves like men of
truth, and reason, comes now before the world to be examined.</p>
            <p>The first I say, is a Story of the long <hi>Disputation</hi> that
was held at <hi>Ashford, Iuly</hi> 27. 1649. from noon, till neer seven at
night, and it's contained in the five first leaves, whereof two whole ones at
least (but say so they had need) are spent in your exact setting down of the
<hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Answers,</hi> and the rest in <hi>praevious</hi> and
<hi>posteriour</hi> passages.</p>
            <p>So that in this first part of your Pamphlet, there are two things
in generall which you profess to give <hi>A true Account</hi> of.</p>
            <p>First, The Propositions agreed on between your selves, and your
<hi>Respondent,</hi> his <hi>Position,</hi> and what else was precedent, and
preparative to the <hi>Disputation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Disputation</hi> it self, and such things as
were subsequent to it, in each of which, if I shew not that you have recorded
more flat falsities, and down-right untruths than one (and that were too much
to fall from your pens, were you <hi>Ministers of Christ</hi> indeed) then let
my own pen record me for a lyar, and my own self bear the blame of
over-charging you, and that for ever.</p>
            <p>In order to a trial of the Truth in this case between you and me,
though I suppose I shall not be more critical in considering, nor volumnous in
dilating on them, than your selves are numerous in bewraying of your own

  <hi>Ministers</hi> both here, and else-where, throughout your book; But if you
  mean <hi>Ministers of Christ, and the Gospel,</hi> I am yet to learn that from
  you (which I never found you very forward to teach me) <hi>viz.</hi> that you
  came truly, and honestly by that Title; you have hitherto wanted no provocation
  from me to prove the lawfulness of your calling: I made bold to denominate you
  <hi>Antichristian Ministers,</hi> in my <hi>Position,</hi> upon the very day of
  the <hi>Disputation,</hi> before those <hi>Thousands,</hi> which (you say) were
  Auditors thereof; And I have asserted the same more abundantly since in that
  let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Mr. <hi>G. C.</hi> which it seems you know so well, as even thence
  to take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a Pet, to publish so much as you have done of your
  <hi>Disputation,</hi> all which is enough to give you to understand that I own
  you not at all in that capacity, yet did you never, no neither then at the
  <hi>Disputation,</hi> nor since in your so true a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of it, so
  much as once open your mouth, or strike one stroke with your pen, whereby to
  evince it, that you are <hi>Christs Ministers,</hi> which gives me to believe,
  that howbeit you have a habit of calling your selves so, yet you had rather men
  believed you, on your bare words, than put you to prove your selves to be so,
  and that you are as utterly uncapable to clear it, as 'tis clear you are
  unwilling to be urged to it.</p>
               <p>You speak of the <hi>Church of</hi> Ashford, <hi>and a
  Communion-Table</hi> in it: 'Twere strange if I should not know what you mean
  thereby, yet had you told this peece of your tale in other Terms, it had been
  so much the less lyable to correction: I know but one <hi>Church of
  Ashford,</hi> that hath a <hi>Communion-Table</hi> in't, and that is those few
  persons, who since they have gladly received the Word of Truth, have been
  according to <hi>Christs</hi> will in that kind, <hi>baptized</hi> in his name
  for remission of sinnes, and do now continue in the Apostles doctrine, and
  fellowship, and in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread, and prayers, to which the Lord I hope
  will add dayly such in those parts as shall be saved: in this <hi>Church</hi>
  there is a <hi>Communion-Table</hi> indeed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the <hi>Table of the
  Lord,</hi> at which they meet, blessing, and drinking that Cup of blessing,
  which is the <hi>Commemoration,</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> also of the blood
  of <hi>Christ,</hi> breaking, and eating that bread, which is the
  <hi>Commemoration,</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> of the body of <hi>Christ,</hi>
  at which you, and your <hi>Respondent</hi> never yet met, but may do yet in due
  time, if the Lord please to grant you, (for till then surely it never will be)
  repentance to the acknowledgement of his truth: But for other
  <hi>Communion-Table,</hi> I wot not <hi>Sirs</hi> that there is any at all at
  <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> As for that <hi>common Table,</hi> which stands in the great
  stone house, where the Bells hang, where the people meet once a week, but never
  do that they should do, if they were disciples of <hi>Christ</hi> indeed, which
  house you call the <hi>Church of Ashford,</hi> (and I cannot but allow you so
  to do (sith you disclaim the true one) the very <hi>Steeple</hi> being well
  nigh as much a truly <hi>constituted Church of Christ,</hi> as a <hi>parish

  <hi>Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> then they do (for ought I see) to this day about that
  <hi>Article</hi> of faith they disputed on, you had need to find some fitter
  phrase for it, than <hi>Communion-Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> for it hath long since ceased to
  be of any such use as for people to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate at it; The Gentleman, my
  beloved friend that is now <hi>Resident</hi> there, and <hi>President</hi> too
  (in pretence at least) as a <hi>Pastor</hi> over that flock, having never
  admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred it at all since his abode among them, nor since the
  <hi>Classis</hi> possest him of that Relation, and gave him orders to feed them
  with that ordinance: why he doth not meddle with that service in his parish,
  would be farre more wonderful to me then 'tis had not mine own
  <hi>conscience</hi> been of the same <hi>constitution</hi> with his when I was
  with him in the same <hi>condition,</hi> for as my own feet stuck once in the,
  same stocks when I stood in <hi>Pastorall</hi> relation to <hi>parochiall</hi>
  people, so I believe him to be further inlightned, then to be free for a
  promiscuous admittance to the Supper of such Societies, among whom he discerns
  (not a few) more goats than sheep, or to hold Communion there, with them whom
  in the Pulpit he cries out on as unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as knowing well enough, there's
  no fellowship to be held between light, and darkness, believers and unbelievers
  in that holy ordinance: yet he <hi>sprinkles the Infants</hi> of all (as you
  also do, and my self blindly did) or else that parish will prove happily to hot
  to hold him: upon what account he doth so I know not, for sure it cannot be
  upon this, because onely <hi>believers Infants</hi> are to be
  <hi>sprinkled.</hi> The Lord open all your eyes to see those sorry shifts
  wherein you shroud your selves for a time from your own sight, so that ye see
  not when ye interfeer, nor feel when you hack your own shins, for who so blind
  as those that cannot see how you act quite contrary to that you argue for, and

               <p>I remember indeed that when 'twas questioned what the question

  whether children ought to be <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed?</hi> but had I been as wise as a

  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42067:9"/> 
                  <hi>sprinkled?</hi> for though <hi>Baptism,</hi> or
  <hi>Dipping</hi> of Infants is that the lawfullness of which you will never be
  able to demonstrate, an error lying still in the Subject, in case you did (as
  in truth you do not) dispense it, yet you are gone further from the truth then
  so, no more (at best) than <hi>Rantizing</hi> that false Subject, which to do
  is indeed no <hi>Raptism</hi> at all: I excepred against this in my
  <hi>Position</hi> as well as the other, but your prudence was pleased to leave
  it out in your accurate <hi>Account</hi> thereof, least it should do you more
  harm than good, and asserted your errour to be double, in your dispensation of
  that you call <hi>Baptism viz.</hi> first in that you plead to have Infants be
  baptized when they ought not, Secondly, in that you pretend to baptize them,
  and yet do not; of both which I demanded an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at that time, and in all

  spoken of, because you have little, or nothing to speak for it, you so took me
  at my word at the <hi>Table</hi> when I yielded to dispute
  <hi>Paedo-baptism,</hi> that <hi>Paedo-rantism</hi> (your only practise) might
  not be medled with in discourse at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I observe when ever you come to dispute for your

  of Believers:</hi> but is not your plea by far too narrow for your practise,
  whilest you commonly <hi>christen</hi> the <hi>Infants</hi> of all? you know
  your people are not all in the faith, why else do you preach to them as
  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane to the end you may convert them thereunto? yet the wickedest wretches
  you so keep from the <hi>Supper,</hi> that you often keep all from it for their
  sakes; have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess with their seed to be <hi>christened,</hi> as freely for
  the most part as the other: doth not that same faith that denominates men
  believers, saints, godly, and gives them, and (as you say) theirs too a true
  title to <hi>Baptism,</hi> intitle their persons to the <hi>Supper?</hi> or
  must a man bring you another, and that a better kind of faith to the one, than
  he had need care for toward the other? this some of your <hi>Tribe</hi> do not
  blush to say, because (as the case is) there is nought else to be said: but
  know ye <hi>Sirs</hi> and they too, that though you have your several sorts of
  Saints for your severall services <hi>viz.</hi> your grosser sort of believers
  to admit (not in their own persons neither when at years, but) in their
  posterity only to your <hi>Rantism,</hi> and a finer sort for the
  <hi>Supper,</hi> yet <hi>Christ</hi> requires but one sort of faith and
  saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to both these ordinances, <hi>viz.</hi> no more than a true one to
  the one, and no less than a true one to the other. Again you had much need (had
  you not think you?) to set children of believing parents as the only subjects
  of <hi>Baptism</hi> in the state of the question between us, when throughout
  your whole Dispute (as I shall shew when I come to consider it) there is not a
  tittle, nor grain of argument brought by you to prove the right of
  <hi>Believers Infants to Baptism,</hi> but it serves as much every whit to
  prove the like for the <hi>Infants of Unbelievers</hi> also: yea <hi>Sirs</hi>
  take this from me, you do your cause a world of wrong in stating your question
  so streightly, for besides that you give the ly therein to your own action,
  which is the admission of all that are brought to you, and are born within the
  precincts of your parishes, you drive your selves to such a <hi>Dilemma</hi> by
  your own disputes, that you will not know how to open your
  <hi>Church-doors</hi> for <hi>Believers Infants</hi> to come in thereat, but
  <hi>Unbelievers Infants</hi> will with ease creep in at them too.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, one word more to this yet: Did your <hi>Respondent</hi>
  assent to you in it (as you seem to say) that the <hi>Baptism</hi> of children
  is practised by the <hi>Church of God?</hi> how pretily have you put these
  terms <hi>[practised by the Church of God]</hi> into the very question, and
  that too as it stands stated beeween us? Did I give, and grant so much? or have
  you not rather taken it for granted from me whether I will, or no?
  <hi>Sirs</hi> I had thought I had given you sufficient evidence of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
  that the <hi>Baptism</hi> of <hi>Infants</hi> is practised by the <hi>Church of
  God;</hi> yea though the <hi>Church of the Pope,</hi> and such as you call the
  <hi>Church of God,</hi> as the <hi>Church of the Prelate, the Church of the
  Presbyter,</hi> and some others too, do dispense <hi>Rantism</hi> to
  <hi>Infants</hi> under the name of <hi>Baptism,</hi> yet I did then, as also I
  do still, <pb n="5" facs="tcp:42067:9"/> deny it to be, or have been practised by any true
  <hi>Church of God</hi> primitive, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, that then was, or now is
  <hi>visibly constituted</hi> according to his will in the word: As for what you
  call the <hi>Church of God</hi> whether you mean all <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> or
  the <hi>Protestant</hi> part of it only, it is even therefore no true visible
  <hi>Church of God</hi> because it <hi>Rantizes Infants:</hi> for that being
  undoubtedly a strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the truth, and an undue administration of that
  ordinance, not only as to the form of it, but the subject also, the name of the
  true visible <hi>Church of God</hi> is <hi>(ipso facto)</hi> destroyed from it,
  were there no more error in it but barely that, if <hi>Doctor Featly</hi> (to
  whom you send us in your <hi>Review)</hi> define the true Church of God aright;
  for while he saies that (meaning that only) is a true Church where the word is
  truly taught, and the Sacraments duly administred, consequently that is no true
  <hi>Church</hi> where baptism is unduely administred; and so it is, (or rather
  <hi>Rantism</hi> instead of it] not only at <hi>Rome,</hi> but in
  <hi>England</hi> also, whilst to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants;</hi> therefore as the <hi>Church
  of Rome</hi> is but a false <hi>Church,</hi> so the <hi>Church of England</hi>
  is no true one. I utterly do therefore, yea and did then, deny that

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, That the Arguments used in the disputation should
  be only express Scriptures, or arguments of necessary consequence from them,
  All Authorities of Fathers and Churches laid aside; though the practise of the
  Church was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, yet would not be yielded to.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. I agree with you that the Arguments should indeed have
  been such only by agreement, but that one of those you then used, or any of
  these few material ones (for the immateriall being of no account with your
  selves you Account not for) which you here expose to be perused is grounded
  upon express Scripture, or any good consequence therefrom I deny, as will I
  hope be manifested in my ensuing <hi>Re-review</hi> of them, and
  <hi>Review</hi> of your <hi>Review</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if by Fathers, whose authority you hang so much on,
  you mean those that were some hundreds of years after <hi>Christ,</hi> and were
  <hi>canonized</hi> more lately for such, as Father <hi>Origen,</hi> Father
  <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> Father <hi>Ierom,</hi> Father <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Father
  <hi>Austin,</hi> and the other objects of the <hi>Clergies Dotage;</hi> and if
  by <hi>Churches</hi> you mean those that were in the ages when, and places
  where these Fathers lived, or any other since the <hi>primitive</hi> times,
  which were the purest, it is but a follie to stand arguing from them, whose
  words and waies are no more the rule of truth to us then ours are to be to them
  that succeed us: for verily they might and did speak sometimes not according to
  the word, and then they were as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terodox</hi> as others, and our selves
  are in as good possibilities as they to speak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word, and then
  we are as <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>Authentick</hi> to the full as themselves.
  I did therefore utterly disown all authority of these <hi>Fathers,</hi> and
  <hi>Churches,</hi> for I knew none they had to be a Standard to after ages: yet
  though I counterpleaded your Plea from their practise, it was not least your
  cause should be advantaged thereby, for even the Testimonie of those
  <hi>Fathers</hi> is against you; but because as they were subjected to the
  word, so were they as subject to error as our selves: but if by
  <hi>Fathers</hi> you mean the <hi>Primitive Prophets, and Apostles</hi> to whom
  all your <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> are but <hi>Children, viz.</hi> Father
  <hi>Peter,</hi> Father <hi>Paul,</hi> Father <hi>Iames,</hi> Father
  <hi>Iude,</hi> Father <hi>Iohn,</hi> whose Doctrine was the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the
  <hi>Churches,</hi> and by <hi>Churches</hi> those that were then built upon
  their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as that of <hi>Ephesus, Corinth, Philippi, Rome,</hi> &amp;c.
  before the falling off <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42067:10"/> from the truth, the
  <hi>Authority</hi> of these <hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>practise</hi> of these
  <hi>Churches</hi> is pleaded for as <hi>seriously</hi> by us, as the other
  <hi>superstitiously</hi> by your selves.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, Here you tell us twas propounded, <hi>That the form of
  the Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be Syllogisticall, which</hi> I, <hi>after many reasons
  alledged by</hi> you <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to inforce the same, at last yielded

            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Reply.</head>
               <p>A very fit phrase for it: for 'twas <hi>inforced</hi> by you
  indeed, yet more by strength of resolution than reason, that 'twas yielded to
  by my self is as true; yet I must profess it was because the Disposition of
  your wills did put me as (as we say) to <hi>Hobsons Choise,</hi> for I saw you
  so desirous to draw your necks out of the coller, and to make any thing in
  excuse to break off the Discourse, that I must choose either that way, or none,
  and therefore rather than the work of that day should fall (as it must have
  done altogether else for you) to the total failing of the <hi>expectation,</hi>
  and hindering the <hi>edification</hi> of the people, I could not but give way
  to your desires: Nevertheless your many reasons (which were but two, and those
  as reasonless too as if you had said nothing) were counter-mand with as many
  more, and those also of so much weight, that because you began to feel them sit
  heavy upon your <hi>Scholastick</hi> skirts, you would have obstructed my
  delivery of them to the people: for what great matters did you alledge whereby
  at that time and place to prove the expediency of such a form? First, that
  'twas given out (as my desire to them is it never may be again) by them of our
  party, that I was a Scholar, and durst meet with Scholars in discourse, and
  therefore seeing I now was before Scholars, it was expected that I should
  dispute in the way that's most usual among them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That the way of
  Dispute by <hi>Syllogisms</hi> (for which some of you had little need to
  dispute, considering their <hi>illogicall,</hi> and <hi>un-syllogisticall</hi>
  doings that day, wherein they were all-to-be-puzzled in their matter by
  fumbling so much about that form) was the clearest, and most compendious to the
  proving of things, and the preventing of extrravagancies, and disorder; much
  what in such a manner did you utter your selves, in order to <hi>inforcing</hi>
  your <hi>Proposition,</hi> to which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply was to this purpose, Namely,
  First, that though I had been in the <hi>Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and a
  <hi>Graduate</hi> there, yet I pretended to no great <hi>Scholarship,</hi> yea,
  that I was a <hi>Dunce,</hi> and a <hi>fool,</hi> which very terms, and no
  other, I repeated again in my <hi>Position,</hi> and was contented to be
  counted for no other, as to that kind of learning of much of which I was
  willingly forgetful, that I might know more of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the
  plainness of his Gospel. Secondly, that I came not thither to dispute, (nor did
  I (the Lord is my witness) in that formal way you stood upon) but in plainness
  to give an account before all, to as many as should ask it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my
  ability, and what liberty you should allot me thereunto, (which yet was well
  nigh none at all) of the way you call <hi>Heresie,</hi> after which I, and many
  o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did worship. Thirdly, that these <hi>Syllogisticall</hi> wayes of
  arguing, and the foolish feigned forms of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and
  <hi>Disputers</hi> of this world, which men might dispute in about the things
  of Nature, and the world, were utterly unsuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the seriousness of the
  things of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Gospel, which were most effectually
  delievered, for so <hi>Paul</hi> chose to hold them out, in all plainness of
  speech, and most commonly hid from people by the <hi>Logicall</hi> terms, and
  <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi> of mans invention; and that the wise and prudent men after
  the flesh, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Casuists</hi> had clouded the
  truth from the world, for ages and generations together, by these their
  artificiall composures, Fourthly, that <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles, the
  most of which were unlearned, and ignorant men, though they were scarce ever
  out of disputes about the Gospell, did yet never dispute by the way of
  <hi>Syllogisms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, That this way was fitter for the <hi>Schooles,</hi> and
  very unfit for that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, where the people, for whose sake we were chiefly
  come together to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42067:10"/> knew not what belonged to
  <hi>mood</hi> and <hi>figure.</hi> Sixthly, that we our selves were now
  <hi>countrisied</hi> by our long non-residence in the <hi>University,</hi> and
  so might very well be to seek on a sudden, and so I found some of you were, to
  <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize</hi> so handsomely as we should do: these were the heads, though
  'tis like not the very words and order of that, which with mighty much a do, I
  had leave to return to your proposall: Notwithstanding, all which you standing
  still so stifly, to have either your own way, or none, I said I would not
  decline it, and so it was agreed to proceed in't. Howbeit, give me leave to
  tell you now, as then I did not, sith you deem it such a wise way of
  <hi>Disputation</hi> to keep to the Rules of the <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies,</hi> that for
  men of gravity, in conference of matters of such eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, it's a
  most <hi>Pedantick, toyish</hi> and <hi>boyish</hi> peece of business to stand
  fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling about <hi>moods</hi> and <hi>figures,</hi> which are but the <hi>A. B.
  C.</hi> or first rudiments to a <hi>Scholar,</hi> and as inferiour to judicious
  discourse indeed, as spelling with the finger is to reading in full perfection,
  and that which is as fit for a wise man to forget, as it is for a fresh man to
  remember: besides, it's the next way round about to the discerning the whole of
  any matter; for all you then said for your way in <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisms,</hi> which
  in substance was no more than this, <hi>viz. That infants have the Spirit,
  faith, holiness, many commendations in Scripture, are such of whom to doubt
  their having the spirit is a breach of Christian charity, whom to deny baptism
  to, makes the Covenant of the Gospel worse than that under the law; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes
  all the hope that parents can have of their salvation, crosses the practise of
  the universall Church,</hi> which one would think you should be ashamed to make
  a book of; might have been expos'd to the consideration of your
  <hi>Respondent,</hi> in much less than half the half quarter, and given out
  plainly enough in a few positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for him to have replied to with your leave
  and silence: but time was so spin'd out by your long productions, and his
  Repetitions of your <hi>Syllogisms,</hi> that there was but a very
  <hi>long-little,</hi> in comparison of what else might have been delivered; and
  <hi>Sirs,</hi> I assure you of this one thing, I beseech you to lay it to heart
  in time, the generation of you <hi>Disputers</hi> is rejected by the Lord, and
  a sort of plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish men raised up, who notwithstanding the curiosity of
  your cudgel-play, and those fine forms of your <hi>Fencing-schools,</hi>
  whereby you shield your selves from the truth, will by their <hi>upright
  down-right</hi> dealings with you, and the word, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to beat your
  cudgels to your heads; and though you seek to lap up the nakednes of your
  waies, from the sight of the people for a time, in a pair of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick</hi>
  breeches, yet these are wearing out a pace, so that you shall see within a

               <p>I was once of that <hi>opinion</hi> indeed, and

  <hi>zeal</hi> thereof (though not according to knowledge) when I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in your

  occasion to recant it, as you will undoubtedly do also first or last, (and O
  that it may be yet in time to your peace!) notwithstanding, your now
  forwardness to uphold it: I was also (in your sence) once a <hi>Minister</hi>
  of the <hi>Church,</hi> but since, going about to look for that

  <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> in the daies of their <hi>Dominion,</hi> by whom I was
  ordained a <hi>Deacon,</hi> i. e. in Scripture-sence, to look toth'poor, but in

  but not by any means the <hi>bread,</hi> unless very specially licensed
  thereunto, till we should come into the full order of <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> for
  so ran the phrase in the old <hi>English horn-book,</hi> which as to that part,
  was stiled, <hi>The book of the Ordination of Bishops, Priests and
  Deacons,</hi> once also by the <hi>Presbyters</hi> (so called) since the time
  of their <hi>Parricid,</hi> or cutting the throats of their fathers the
  <hi>Bishops,</hi> that gave the being of <hi>Priesthood</hi> to them, and
  inducting themselves to reign in their stead, as the <hi>Bishops</hi>
  themselves had dealt not long before with their old father the <hi>Pope,</hi>
  who gave the being of <hi>Priesthood</hi> to them both, from whom not as a
  <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> but a true <hi>Presbytery,</hi> as they say, I was in
  orders to practise their refined <hi>Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> more perfectly, which I might

  can prove things to have their true being, without either their true
  <hi>matter</hi> or true <hi>form:</hi> for as the subject matter whereof it
  consists is false, being not <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized believers,</hi> so the <hi>form</hi>
  into which the <hi>Pope</hi> cast it some 600 years since, in to which also the

  <hi>your</hi> selves <hi>revile Rome</hi> in calling her a <hi>Harlot</hi>
  because she is so: you hint at my renouncing my first <hi>baptism:</hi> can a

  <hi>child,</hi> as tis no signe to me now, for I remember not that I ever saw
  it, so I learn by the hear-say of it, that it was not <hi>baptism</hi> at all:

  for <hi>Infant-baptism:</hi> I shall shew the <hi>falsness</hi> of the one, and

  your relation</hi> (so <hi>you</hi> term it) is most manifestly false, if not
  as false a one as was ever pend, or printed concerning such a matter; since the
  <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Priests,</hi> perceiving their kingdom to decline by

  the memories of <hi>you Accountants,</hi> least by telling the whole truth
  <hi>you</hi> should shame the devil and your selves, which may suffice to prove
  a disproportion between <hi>your Tattale,</hi> and its <hi>Title</hi> of

  were to be baptized, whether old or young, so that if <hi>you</hi> could so
  effectually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct children at three or four <hi>years of age</hi> as to
  bring them to make such profession of faith; as <hi>I</hi> could not but judge
  to proceed from the reality thereof within, <hi>I</hi> could then for my part
  <hi>baptize</hi> them; <hi>yet I</hi> thought it was a thing very seldome if

  were <hi>you</hi> mistaken in <hi>my</hi> meaning, as down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly to set me
  out for such a <hi>Childish Novice,</hi> as met <hi>you</hi> before
  <hi>thousands</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the unlawfulnes of <hi>Childrens Baptism,</hi>
  and held a Discourse of 6 <hi>hours</hi> to that end, and <hi>yet</hi> confest
  the lawfulness of it so soon as ever we had well begun: but <hi>Sirs,</hi>
  suppose <hi>I</hi> had confessed (as <hi>I</hi> did not) that children of
  <hi>three or four years old,</hi> because capable at that age to be instructed,
  might without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the begetting of faith in them, by that instruction,
  even then, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon only be <hi>baptized;</hi> yet will you not at last
  be ashamed think <hi>you</hi> of that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant assertion of <hi>yours,
  namely,</hi> that <hi>infants of a day old are as capable of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> as
  they? for grant it should be granted <hi>you</hi> (as it is not) that bare
  instruction without any success thereof to conversion is a good ground to
  <hi>baptize</hi> persons on at <hi>three or four years of age,</hi> yet is it a
  ground whereupon to <hi>baptize Infants of a day old,</hi> that are not capable
  of so much as that bare instruction? a man may in much wisedom, and some hopes
  (if not of present <hi>yet)</hi> of future conversion thereby begin to
  indoctrinate his <hi>children at three or four years old,</hi> and instill the
  principles of truth into them, as preparative to their obeying it hereafter,
  and also to <hi>baptism</hi> it self in due time; yet <hi>I</hi> judge him as
  very a <hi>Child</hi> as his <hi>Child,</hi> that goes about to instruct, and
  <hi>baptize</hi> it so soon as tis born; yet after <hi>your</hi> own
  as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, by which <hi>you</hi> would make men believe <hi>I</hi> asserted
  that <hi>children of three or four years old are capable of instruction,</hi>
  and consequently of baptism so young, <hi>you</hi> second it with another more
  absurd, and false than the former, <hi>namely, that children of a day old are
  [as] capable of it as they:</hi> Say <hi>you</hi> so <hi>Sirs?</hi> are infants
  of a <hi>day old</hi> capable of <hi>Baptism,</hi> that cannot so much as be
  instructed in principles much less be begotten to the true Religion? or if
  <hi>you</hi> say <hi>you</hi> hold not their right to <hi>baptism</hi> from a
  capableness of instruction from which <hi>you</hi> plead the other, but upon
  other grounds, upon what grounds? <hi>I</hi> beseech you <hi>Sirs,</hi> upon
  what grounds? as <hi>you</hi> offered to shew them then so shew them now if
  <hi>you</hi> can, for none of the Arguments in <hi>your Account</hi> can
  possibly prove such a thing. What <hi>Infants of a day old?</hi> I'le saie it
  again that <hi>you</hi> may consider it, for sure <hi>you</hi> did not
  consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what you said when <hi>you</hi> said it, what <hi>children of day
  old?</hi> fie for shame, <hi>Sirs</hi> had you said <hi>infants of eight daies
  old</hi> it might have held some proportion with that grand ground you go upon,
  <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Analogy</hi> between <hi>Baptism</hi> and
  <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> but this opinion doth not cotten at all with that, for
  the subject of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> which you all say, though falsely, is one
  and the same with that of <hi>Baptism,</hi> was one of at least <hi>eight daies
  old,</hi> and an <hi>Infant of one day</hi> only was not a warrantable subject
  thereof, nor an <hi>infant of seven daies</hi> neither, though likely to die
  before the eighth; but as for you, though your chief plea for your <hi>timely
  untimely rantizing Infants</hi> be grounded upon that timely dispensation of
  <hi>Circumcision,</hi> yet, as if you had a mind to proclaim your selves
  <hi>be-blinded,</hi> so that you cannot walk by <hi>Christs</hi> Right rules,
  nor <hi>your</hi> own wrong ones neither, you take the liberty to out-stand, or
  anticipate the <hi>eighth day</hi> at <hi>your</hi> pleasure: hence the birth
  day is as warrantable with you, as the eight, yea, in case of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger
  of death (in which case circumcision might not alter) ti's a learned question
  among some <hi>Infant-sprinklers,</hi> whether the mid-wife may not
  <hi>sprinkle</hi> it before its born, <hi>i. e.</hi> while is hangs yet between

  may be deferred for no less than <hi>two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred daies</hi> together,

  not ministered but at two times in the year, viz. at Easter and Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sontide,
  but that custome being grown out of use for many considerations</hi> (I know
  not any but the Clergies good will, and pleasure) <hi>cannot now well be
  restored:</hi> Thus you ride people to and fro as you list, and run manie miles
  from your own rules as well as <hi>Christs,</hi> for if <hi>Circumcision</hi>
  be your <hi>Rule</hi> for the time of <hi>Baptisms</hi> administration, keep
  punctually to the particular time of the eighth day, as well as to the generall
  time of <hi>Infancy,</hi> or else (you may tell me the eighth day is a
  <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance</hi> not to be regarded, whilst I tell you'tis such a
  <hi>substance</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> was like to be slain for overslipping
  it, yet) by your favour, <hi>Sirs,</hi> and by the same reason that you take an
  inch, i'le take an ell, yea if you can acceptably go a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers bredth besides
  the rule of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> I may go an hundred furlongs, and by the

  were promised to all his seed together with him, yet there were somethings also
  promised to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Covenant of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> which
  his seed had no promise of at all, as namely, First, That he should be the
  Father of all Believers. This I am most certain I then instanc'd in, and
  according to your then demand cleared by <hi>Scripture,</hi> even that very
  <hi>Scripture</hi> which was then quoted by your selves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.
  and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the whole verse, whereof <hi>you,</hi> for <hi>your</hi> own
  ends, mentioned but a part, I told <hi>you</hi> twas evident even thence that
  <hi>Abraham</hi> had one preheminence, and priviledge that none of his
  posteritie had ever after him, which he obtained of God by his
  <hi>preheminence</hi> in believing, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Fatherhood of the
  faithful;</hi> of which eminent faith of his, which was imputed to him for
  righteousness, as well as of that eminent prerogative, the <hi>Fatherhood of
  the faithful,</hi> which God gave him upon that great faith,
  <hi>Circumcision</hi> was given him as a seal, in such a sence, as twas never
  given to his seed, a <hi>Seal</hi> I said, for it was a <hi>sign</hi> only but
  no <hi>seal</hi> to his posteritie, to honor the greatness, not to strengthen
  the weakness of his faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> to confirm him, that was so great a
  believer, even beyond hope, in that honorable title, which <hi>God</hi> put
  upon him; therfore I told you it runs thus, <hi>viz. he received the sign
  circumcision,</hi> i. e. circumcision, (which in its ordinary use was a sign) a
  <hi>seal</hi> to him in this special sense, <hi>i. e.</hi> as a <hi>seal of the
  righteousness of</hi> that eminent <hi>faith which he had, that he might be, i.
  e.</hi> to that very end and purpose as to ratifie him in that royal title,
  <hi>The father of all that believe;</hi> to this purpose I then spake, shewing
  withall that in the same sense in which the father is said to <hi>seal</hi> the
  sonne, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 27. to be the giver of that meat that endures to
  eternall life, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>him hath the father sealed, i. e.</hi>
  autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized to that business, honoured with that office, and as
  <hi>Pharoah</hi> honoured <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> with the sole Dispensation of all
  the Corn, and Government of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and as <hi>Kings</hi> under the
  <hi>Broad seal</hi> do <hi>seal</hi> men to, <hi>i. e.</hi> honour them with,
  and settle them in great Places, Trusts and Titles, &amp;c. in such a sense is
  God in that place said to give <hi>Circumcision</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
  whereby to <hi>seal</hi> him up, and settle him for ever in that glorious
  title, <hi>viz. the father of all that believe;</hi> in which sense
  <hi>Circumcision</hi> (though a <hi>sign</hi> of some things in common to him
  with his posterity) was never given to any one of <hi>Abrahams</hi> posterity
  at all: this as it is clearly held forth in that place, so was so clearly held
  forth to you from that place of your own naming at that very time, that as I
  wondered you could be ignorant of it then, so I much more admire, that you are
  not ashamed to bewray such <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling</hi> in the recording of it as
  <hi>you</hi> do, and such wretched ignorance of it still; besides, I know not
  whether I instanc'd then in any other, but I am sure (as shy as you seem to be
  of it) there were divers more promises made, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges made over to
  <hi>Abraham</hi> under the great <hi>Seal Circumcision,</hi> which were neither
  made nor given, much less confirmed by <hi>Circumcision</hi> as a <hi>seal</hi>
  thereof to all his posterity, <hi>viz.</hi> that his seed should inherit
  <hi>Canaan,</hi> this though it was made. and made good to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
  and that seed of his to whom it was promised, yet not to the seed of all his
  seed, for many of his posterity (as <hi>Ishmael,</hi> who was
  <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised,</hi> and his children by <hi>Keturah</hi> also, and their
  whole race) had none of all this seal'd to them by <hi>Circumcision:</hi>
  Again, that <hi>Christ</hi> should come out of his loyns, that in his seed all
  Nations should be blessed, these were made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> 
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:42067:16"/> and were (as the rest also) great <hi>Priviledges</hi> to
  the honour of which he was <hi>sealed,</hi> yet though 'twas <hi>signified</hi>
  to all his seed by <hi>Circumcision,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> should come of
  him after the flesh, all of them had not that priviledge by promise that
  <hi>Christ</hi> should come of them after the flesh: by all which it
  unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably appears that the same Covenant of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> in every
  of those respects in which <hi>Circumcision</hi> was given him as a
  <hi>seal</hi> of it, was not given to all the <hi>Iews,</hi> and their
  children, and that fore-named place speaks of <hi>Circumcision</hi> onely in
  reference to <hi>Abrahams</hi> person, and in that sense, and respect in which
  it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him only as a <hi>Seal</hi> of his faith. <hi>i. e.</hi> that
  strong faith he acted, and gave glory to <hi>God</hi> by, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20.
  for which <hi>God</hi> also gave that great glory and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to him, <hi>viz.
  the father-hood of the faithfull:</hi> All which notwithstanding, and much to
  the same effect that was uttered then, to shew that <hi>Circumcision</hi> had
  more ends, and relations to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Person, then to the Persons of
  his seed; yea, and though your own paper, which lastly I appeal to, doth
  testifie that I I multiplied words, that is to say, spake much about other ends
  of <hi>Circumcision</hi> to <hi>Abraham</hi> then to his seed, yet <hi>you</hi>
  both be-lie me, and give the lie to <hi>your</hi> selves so far as to say, I
  was <hi>extreamly foundered,</hi> which to say, and yet to say in the very same
  line, that I multiplied words about other ends of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> the

  this, that being call'd to speak punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to that end, <hi>viz.</hi> whether
  <hi>Circumcision</hi> were a <hi>seal of the righteousness of faith to</hi>
  Abrahams <hi>posterity</hi> at all or not, or if not to shew it, <hi>I answered
  nothing</hi> to that particular, <hi>that carried any sense or reason</hi> in
  it: but really <hi>Sirs,</hi> I said no less to that very end, but rather much
  more then I have said a little above, which whether it have any <hi>sense</hi>
  or <hi>reason</hi> in't or no, yet was it both <hi>sensless</hi> and
  <hi>reasonless</hi> in <hi>you</hi> however to leave it wholly out, and you had

  <hi>Iude</hi> speaks of that speak evil of that they know not? yet you give us
  not in the least measure to know, no not so much as the sum of what it was. Now
  as for my self, I must profess in the sight of the Lord <hi>I</hi> do not well
  remember <hi>my</hi> self, nor can <hi>I</hi> yet clearly recall it to mind
  what <hi>Answer I</hi> then gave to that passage, which if <hi>I</hi> did,
  <hi>I</hi> durst not but express it here, were it weak or strong, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
  <hi>I</hi> do not, <hi>I</hi> therefore dare not meddle so much as to mention
  any, being resolved to repeat no more of either <hi>yours</hi> or

  <hi>you</hi> know to be the sence of such as you call <hi>Anabaptists,</hi>
  witness your selves in two places, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 8. where you give account
  of our opinion thus, <hi>viz, That way of the presentment of the righteousness
  of Christ without faith is a figment of the Anabaptists,</hi> also p. 15. thus,
  <hi>the adversaries are put to theirshifts to find out a new way for the
  salvation of infants dying in their minority viz. the presentment of the
  satisfaction of Christ without faith:</hi> in both which places you give the
  world to understand, that you know our opinion to be that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> are
  <hi>justified</hi> by neither <hi>works,</hi> nor <hi>faith,</hi> which is a
  <hi>work,</hi> but, if at all, by that which your selves hold is the material

  being capable to act faith, it is required as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, <hi>viz.</hi> the
  <hi>righteousness of Christ:</hi> secondly, you know that this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is

  <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by works</hi> then <hi>yours</hi> can possibly be found to

  <hi>Infants</hi> by <hi>Christ</hi> without <hi>faith,</hi> or any other
  <hi>work</hi> either, which <hi>you</hi> know is no part of <hi>Popery,</hi>

  he had held it, yea secondly which is worse, and down-rightly injurious,
  <hi>you</hi> are not ashamed to <hi>tell-tale</hi> him to the world in the

  deliverie of it self in publique by word of mouth was with so little credit to
  <hi>your</hi> cause, that it might very easily be as ashamed to shew its face
  in print, as the <hi>Scribes</hi> that penn'd it seem'd to be to shew their
  <hi>names;</hi> And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less so it would have been, but that it came
  disguis'd; And <hi>yet</hi> even this <hi>false face,</hi> whereby you have
  made it shew fairer by farr on one side (I mean <hi>your own)</hi> then at
  first it did, is so black, so blind, so full of blurres and blemishes, that it

  that <hi>you</hi> were as like him in his <hi>best,</hi> as <hi>you</hi> are

  <hi>your</hi> fall from heaven thither in the <hi>loins</hi> of <hi>your</hi>
  Father <hi>Abaddon, Revel.</hi> 9. 1. So that it reels to and fro like a
  Drunkard, is moved exceedingly, like to be split in pieces, clean dissolved,
  utterly devoured with a curse, for <hi>your</hi> sinns principally, O <hi>yee
  Priests,</hi> who have trangressed the Laws of <hi>Christ</hi> the only
  <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Law-giver,</hi> changed his Ordinances, broken the
  everlasting covenant: neither will the sea of the whole world cease to roar
  about <hi>you,</hi> and be outragious till the lot fall upon <hi>you,</hi> as
  it did on <hi>Ionas,</hi> to be cast forth, though the <hi>Ship-Masters</hi>
  row never so hard to have <hi>you</hi> spared; nor till the Tempestuous waves,
  on which <hi>you</hi> seek still to swim <pb n="41" facs="tcp:42067:27"/> aloft, have
  over-whelm'd you so on every side, that you be fain to cry <hi>Alas</hi> out of
  the belly of hell. But <hi>Alas</hi> though the ship rock, and is ready to
  suffer ship-wrack, yet as if they had made a Covenant with death, and with hell
  were at at an agreement, So rockt asleep is <hi>Ionas,</hi> so sluggish are our
  <hi>Renegado Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> that they yet discern not the <hi>mystery</hi> of
  the things that are upon them, but are stark sensless of the <hi>stirs</hi>
  that are about them, and of the storms which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are most concern'd
  in.</p>
               <p>And what the <hi>Gourd</hi> was to <hi>Ionas</hi> in his heat,
  even such is this <hi>Disputation</hi> also to your cause of

  <hi>Doo</hi> back again in no worse wise then it deserved, Asserting that your
  <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> of <hi>Infant-sprinkling</hi> from that <hi>non-entity</hi>
  of <hi>Infant-believing</hi> was shamefull and childish <hi>pedling,</hi> and

  and <hi>loadsome,</hi> that you <hi>Disputers</hi> immediately became
  <hi>Scribes,</hi> and posted out a piece of <hi>Print</hi> on a sleeveles

  to be done) maintain your <hi>Infant-sprinkling</hi> (which <hi>premi hand
  suprimi potest,</hi> the more you tread the more you spread) your credit may
  grow so crazy upon't as to die indeed, as indeed it doth, and that daily, for
  as zealous as you are to <hi>unlade</hi> your selves in your <hi>Romish</hi>

               <p>Howbeit I say to give you your due, you had bowels toward it far
  beyond him, who was <hi>neerer kin</hi> to it then your selves, for whereas he
  should have bin by right at all the pains and charges too that day, as being
  most concern'd in the business of it, yet he withdrew himself from both; but
  you, who, as you say were not the men appointed for the <hi>disputation, drew
  neer</hi> and undertook it, and were at such pains about it, that how far forth
  you <hi>gnawd your tongues</hi> for pain I cannot say, but <hi>I</hi> may
  safely say you <hi>blasphemed the God of heaven</hi> both then and since, so
  farre forth as to call his truth <hi>Heresie</hi> is to blaspheme him, because
  of your <hi>pains</hi> and your <hi>sores,</hi> nor do <hi>I</hi> hear that you
  yet Repent of your deeds: in a word though lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to th'purpose, yet your
  <hi>cares</hi> concerning this <hi>Infant-disputation</hi> were very great,
  when his, whose it was, were none at all save how to keep far enough from it,
  that it might be strangled before ever it came to light.</p>
               <p>Thus it outliv'd one or two <hi>smothers,</hi> to which it was
  designed by its <hi>first father, viz.</hi> both in and coming out of the womb,
  <hi>much laud</hi> therefore which you love more then a little, to you the kind
  <hi>uncles</hi> for it, who so seasonably interposing your selves, swadled it
  up as <hi>sairly</hi> as you could in such foul <hi>shifts</hi> as you had then
  a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you in such wise at least as to save the life on't, or else it had
  surely miscarried, and come well nigh to nothing, before it was well any thing

               <p>Now in small process of time, perceiving perhaps that you had
  over-charged your selves unawares in <hi>Adopting</hi> this
  <hi>Ashford-disputation,</hi> the fruit of another mans loins, into your own
  future <hi>Tuition,</hi> by taking the <hi>Patronage</hi> thereof upon you, so
  publiquely as you had done that day before many people; and possibly not more
  <hi>asham'd</hi> of its former poor appearance, then <hi>afraid</hi> that a
  further appearance of it in publique might put you to more charge and shame,
  even you the <hi>foster fathers</hi> also, who had been so kind as to keep it
  from killing, and to perform the <hi>mid-wivery</hi> und <hi>nursery</hi>
  thereof before, had a design now to <hi>smother</hi> it your selves, in order
  whereunto you had buried it alive it seems, and <hi>rak'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> it up in the <hi>ashes</hi> of oblivion, that it
  might live no longer in mens minds, but rather return <hi>dust</hi> to
  <hi>dust, Ashes</hi> to <hi>Ashes</hi> as it was, hoping the <hi>Sepulchre</hi>
  of your si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was so sure, that the <hi>Ghost</hi> would never walk about to
  the cost, shame, and affrightment of its guilty <hi>Guardians</hi> any
  more.</p>
               <p>But all this avails not yet, the <hi>Baby-disputation</hi> was
  not fully <hi>smothered</hi> for all that; for people of all sorts were in a

  Arguments for <hi>Infant-baptism</hi> without prejudice, <hi>i. e.</hi> not
  passing sentence on them till I had heard them, when you urg'd 
  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:42067:31"/> them at first at the <hi>Disputation</hi> by word of
  mouth, so <hi>God</hi> is my witness how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten I have read them ore and ore
  again without <hi>prejudice,</hi> seriously setting my self to weigh them most
  impartially, in the ballance of both <hi>Scripture and reason,</hi> since you
  urg'd them ore again in <hi>print:</hi> nevertheless I cannot possibly (unless
  I speak against the light of my conscience) judge them to be any other then
  what I said before, and what your selves are pleased here to acknowledge them
  to be before all the world, begging of people <hi>in charity to couer the
  weakness of them, viz.</hi> but weak Arguments; which ingenuous confession of
  yours if it be not a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the cause, Iappeal notonly to all rational men
  that shall happen to read this, who know that the <hi>truth or falshood</hi> of
  all causes respectively lies in the <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>weakness</hi> of
  the <hi>Arguments,</hi> that are brought in defence thereof, so that they
  either stand or fall according as the Arguments to uphold them (be they
  <hi>few</hi> or <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)</hi> are either <hi>weak</hi> or <hi>weig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ty,</hi> but also to your selves, who
  tell us truly and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that tis the <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>Arguments</hi>
  onely (and he is a <hi>weak</hi> man that saies <hi>weak</hi> ones are
  <hi>weighty</hi> ones) that carries the cause: your own words if they may be of
  any weight with you are these p, 12. <hi>viz. besides that opinion of</hi>
  Ovid, <hi>Et si non prosunt singula, multa juvant, what ever it may carry of
  credit in other causes ought to have but little in this, where we trust not in
  multitude, nor measure by number; but substance and weight of Arguments are the
  foundation of our faith; the other are for pomp and victory, these onely for
  satisfaction and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> so that if a man might hope you would stick to
  this candid concession of yours and not start from it, there need not be much
  said in discovery of the <hi>weakness,</hi> or <hi>non-weightness</hi> of your
  <hi>Arguments,</hi> and consequently of the <hi>Rottenness</hi> of your cause,
  for the world it self may hear what you say out of your own mouths in this very
  <hi>vindicatory Account</hi> of yours, wherein you not onely publish some of
  your <hi>Arguments</hi> in that same <hi>weakness and nakedness</hi> wherein at
  first they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, so that every eye may discern it, having leave now to
  examine them at leasure, but also after not a few vain glorious
  <hi>vauntings,</hi> and <hi>ventings</hi> of your selves concerning them, as of
  <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>weighry,</hi> in way of defence of them from those
  <hi>sleightings,</hi> those <hi>disgraces,</hi> those <hi>injuries</hi> and
  <hi>censures</hi> of them as <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>wanting,</hi> which they are
  under as from us, at last being sensible of their <hi>weakness</hi> you sing a
  new song to the tune of <hi>cry you mercy,</hi> and fall a beseeching the
  Reader in <hi>his charity to cover the weakness of them:</hi> by which
  <hi>weak</hi> petition you may work upon some <hi>weak</hi> ignorants, that are
  not book learn'd, or (if they be) stand bent to believe all things as you
  desire them, but on none that are truly disciples, though onely <hi>A. b. c.
  darians</hi> in the School of <hi>Cbrist,</hi> but <hi>Sirs,</hi> what need so
  much <hi>peccavi</hi> and <hi>precari?</hi> if your ware were currant it would
  go off with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance without such a deal of <hi>cap</hi> and
  <hi>congee,</hi> and pittiful intreaty to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>cover the
  weakness</hi> of <hi>your Arguments,</hi> the strength of which onely should
  cause him to gather the goodness of your cause, and not strong intreaty to take
  it for good, though the <hi>Arguments</hi> you plead it by are but <hi>weak:
  Uino vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili non opus est haedera:</hi> if your Arguments and reasons for
  <hi>baby-baptism</hi> be strong and solid, your Reader (if rational) will
  receive them; if weak (as you say they are) he is a Reader scarce worth writing
  reason to, who will be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with by your desire so to cover their
  weakness as <hi>in charity</hi> to suffer himself to be overcome, and carried
  away by them (notwithstanding that their <hi>weakness)</hi> to close with you
  in your cause, and to be beaten into a belief of your <hi>baptism</hi> as good,
  though it hath but broken reeds and bulrushes to <hi>maintain</hi> it, by the
  force of bare <hi>beggings</hi> and <hi>beseechings</hi>

                  </note>: or if in this request of yours to us, <hi>to
  co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the weakness</hi> of <hi>your</hi> Arguments <hi>your</hi> meaning is,
  not that we should be so silly as to build our belief and practice upon them,
  though weak by your own confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whose they are; but onely that we should
  not <hi>publish, discover</hi> and <hi>divulge</hi> their <hi>weakness</hi> to
  the world, but <hi>in charity</hi> be content to think our think, or to see and
  say nothing; truly <hi>Sirs,</hi> what others will do at your request in this
  kind I know not, <pb n="49" facs="tcp:42067:31"/> but I assure you I cannot possibly for my
  part grant your desire in this case, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as your selves have engaged me
  several waies not to be silent, on pain of giving away the cause; which if it
  were onely <hi>my</hi> own too, the matter were so much the less, you should
  have it with all my heart; yea verily and my own life too to do <hi>your</hi>
  souls good, for I know I could freely part with it to be a means of effecting
  <hi>your</hi> salvation; but since it is the cause of <hi>God,</hi> which he
  hath intrusted me with the pleading of against <hi>you,</hi> who presume to
  enter the lists against it, with such <hi>silly tools,</hi> and <hi>weak
  weapons,</hi> on behalf of a <hi>Babish-baptism</hi> which is not from heaven,
  but of men, I dare not give place so far as in foolish pitty to spare the
  Cittie <hi>Babylon,</hi> or in <hi>Charity</hi> not to bewray a <hi>Breach</hi>
  or <hi>weakness</hi> in her walls of defence, when I spie it, for that were in
  <hi>Charity</hi> to betray the truth of of God, and such <hi>Charity</hi> is
  more <hi>Antichristian,</hi> by far then <hi>Christian,</hi> what ere you call
  it, and such as could have small hope of acceptance before <hi>God,</hi>
  how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever esteemed of among men: wherefore I desire you to have me excused, if I
  cannot in <hi>charity cover the weakness of</hi> your Arguments, for in
  <hi>Charity</hi> to poor souls, that are led aside from the way of truth by
  your <hi>piteous pious</hi> pretences, and weak reasonings for your way, and I
  am concerned in the very next place, after I have done with this of yours to
  the Reader, to discover to the world the weakness of them: besides sith you
  have made so bold with your selves, as to proclaime the weakness of your own
  Arguments for <hi>Infant-baptism</hi> (I hope the Counties of <hi>Kent</hi> and
  <hi>Sussex</hi> will consider this, that their <hi>choise Ministry</hi> that
  stood up to maintain <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi> at <hi>Ashford,</hi> did after in
  their own <hi>Account</hi> theerof give out of their own accord, that there was
  weakness in the <hi>Arguments</hi> they brought for that purpose) <hi>men
  mutire nefas?</hi> I hope it shall be no offence to you for me to second you in
  your own saying; 'tis you who have publisht <hi>your</hi> arguments to be weak,
  <hi>my</hi> business shall be only publickly to prove them so to be as you
  assert them: yet if it be offensive to you, it shall be no wonder to me, for I
  know already that <hi>you</hi> can bear it better to have your
  <hi>Disputation</hi> ly under disgrace and disparagement, under shame and
  censure of weakness from your selves in print, then from your sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
  <hi>Adversary,</hi> and true <hi>Friend</hi> my self so much as in a
  <hi>private Letter</hi> only; and that some men (as the Proverb is) may more

               <p>Tis both usual, and lawfull for us to judge of <hi>causes</hi>
  by the <hi>effects,</hi> that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and necessarily flow from them, for
  <hi>qualis causa,</hi> i. e. <hi>naturalis, &amp; per se, talis effectus, &amp;
  Retró;</hi> e. g. <hi>Infant-sprinkling</hi> hath been a cause
  <hi>efficient</hi> and <hi>per se,</hi> from whence much evil hath
  <hi>necessarily</hi> crept into the world, for it hath been a means of
  confounding the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> together, of letting the
  <hi>Gentiles</hi> or Nations by whole sale into the <hi>outter Court,</hi> of
  filling the world with meer nominal <hi>Christians,</hi> and carnal
  <hi>Christianity,</hi> whereby they have got advantage ever since to tread down
  the <hi>holy City,</hi> and true worship and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, as <hi>Heresie,
  Hereticks,</hi> of bringing the nations into one <hi>Catholick Church</hi>
  whereof the <hi>Pope</hi> was universall <hi>Bishop,</hi> or overseer for ages
  together, thorow the eyes of his creatures the <hi>Clergy,</hi> the very
  <hi>Stirrup</hi> whereby he and his <hi>Ministers,</hi> who have blended
  themselves into a blind and beastly <hi>uniformity,</hi> have become
  <hi>Masters</hi> of the <hi>Kingdomes,</hi> and have got up to ride them; a
  plea and president for <hi>traditions,</hi> (it being one it self) which ever
  make <hi>Gods</hi> commands void, and mens worship of <hi>God</hi> in vain; an
  inlet of these and innumerable more mischiefs and absurdities, for <hi>posito
  hoc uno absurdo sequuntur mille,</hi> therefore it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly an <hi>ill
  cause:</hi> also tis lawfull to judge of a cause by the common
  <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents</hi> which come from it, not as <hi>caused</hi> properly, but
  meerly <hi>occasioned</hi> by it, and in respect of which it is called only
  <hi>causa sine quâ non, i. e.</hi> that without which <pb n="50" facs="tcp:42067:32"/> the other would not be, and yet no other then the bare
  <hi>accidentall occasions</hi> of those <hi>effects,</hi> which flow from
  something else as the cause thereof <hi>perse;</hi> and most especially when
  those <hi>consequents</hi> are declared by the word of God to be such, as will
  upon that occasion <hi>universally</hi> and <hi>unavoidably</hi> come to pass;
  and thus we may give a shrew'd guess that our cause is good, <hi>viz.</hi> that
  our <hi>Gospel, Ministery, Church-way</hi> and <hi>Baptism</hi> is the true
  one, because we see it is secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded now, and ever hath been with what it was of
  old seconded, and foretold also that it should ever be even every where to the
  worlds end, <hi>viz.</hi> divisions in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, <hi>two against three, and
  three against two, the Father against the Son, the Daughter against the Mother
  &amp;c.</hi> offences of friends, and fleshly relations, the account of
  <hi>Heresie</hi> and baseness, hatred of men, persecution, cavils, stits,
  tumults about it, by which things <hi>Christs</hi> people, Gospel, Ministers,
  and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations are ever proved to be his <hi>Luke.</hi> 12. 52. 53.

  <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 4, 5. So that where theres none of this I avouch the
  <hi>Gospell</hi> in its purity is not there though where these are the Gospel
  is not the cause for that is men lusts and flesh fighting against the light,
  but the only the <hi>occasion,</hi> whereupon they arise; when <hi>Satan</hi>
  the strong man holds the house the goods are all in peace, but when
  <hi>Christ</hi> the stronger man comes to storm him out, there's contention, in
  hearts, houses, Towns and Countries, as when <hi>Christ</hi> came to
  <hi>Ierusalem</hi> all was in an uproar, and when <hi>Paul</hi> came with his
  Gospel to <hi>Ephesus, Athens, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe</hi> lewd fellows of the
  baser sort were set on by others to raise tumults, for truth tormented them
  into rage; thus we often judge of <hi>Causes</hi> as <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,
  right</hi> or <hi>wrong,</hi> by the <hi>effects</hi> that slow from them, but
  to reason upon a cause as <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>ill, true,</hi> or <hi>false,
  right</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> according to the <hi>might</hi> or
  <hi>meaness,</hi> the <hi>abilities</hi> or <hi>defects</hi> of the persons
  that stand up for it is the right way to wrong it indeed, sith the
  <hi>Antichristian</hi> cause hath the mighty, wise, and prudent
  <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> of the world for its
  <hi>Patrons,</hi> when the poor only, for the most part, receive
  <hi>Christs</hi> Gospell and the strength that God ordains in defence thereof
  against the persecutor is the mouths of <hi>Babes</hi> and <hi>Sucklings.</hi>
  Causes are to be rejected as <hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>false</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to
  the <hi>defects</hi> and <hi>weakness</hi> that is discovered to be in the
  <hi>Arguments</hi> that are brought to maintain, and not by the weakness and
  defects that may seem to be in those that are more <hi>zealous</hi> then
  <hi>able</hi> to mannage them, if there appear to be weight in the Arguments:
  these if strong however <hi>weakly</hi> and <hi>babishly</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded will
  carry the cause in the conscience of any, but such <hi>Priest-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charmed</hi>
  Christians, as in <hi>Charity</hi> to their <hi>Churchmen,</hi> are resolved to
  yield themselves up to be carried away with every wind of doctrine that passes
  from them, and, <hi>covering the weakness of them,</hi> to be whisled any way
  by such arguments as the men themselves, that make them are fain to grant to be
  weak to prove what they are brought for; for no <hi>Argument</hi> is weak that
  is sufficient to evince the thing its used in proof of, though it fall from the
  mouth of never so weak a man; if a weak feeble hand let fall an heavy Axe upon
  it, or a sharp sword, even the sword of the Spirit the word of God, that is
  quick and powerfull it may serve to cut off the <hi>Popes head, Tripple
  Crown</hi> and all, but if the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, and all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
  which are the ablest <hi>Humanists</hi> in the world, come out to warre against
  <hi>Christ</hi> and his cause with <hi>reeds</hi> and <hi>rushes, blind non
  sequiturs, weak</hi> and <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Consequences,</hi> they must ride back to
  <hi>Rome</hi> for stronger swords, or else they may force fools into
  <hi>conformity</hi> to their follies, but never guide wise men after the spirit
  to believe their cause to be good: as therefore tis not good that an ill cause,
  that hath but weak Arguments to uphold it, should be owned for good, either in
  <hi>Charity,</hi> or upon pretence of <hi>ability</hi> in the persons that
  <hi>patronize</hi> it, as the <hi>Clergies</hi> crooked cause of
  <hi>Infant-sprinkling</hi> is, for what saies the Parish to those <hi>poor
  ones</hi> in it, that entertain the Gospel, are you wiser than a whole
  <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> of able <hi>Orthodox</hi> Divines? so it is a thousand pitties
  that a good cause, that <pb n="51" facs="tcp:42067:32"/> hath strong Arguments enough from
  Scripture, and reason to prove it right, should be wronged so, as to be
  rejected as rotten (yet so <hi>Christs</hi> true baptism is) through the
  defects of the persons called <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> who are supposed at least
  to have more <hi>zeal</hi> then <hi>ability</hi> to prove it; of which sin of
  wronging a right cause upon account of such defects, even the cause of
  <hi>Christs</hi> true baptism, which in his strength those <hi>Babes</hi> that
  are baptized with it are not only <hi>zealous,</hi> but <hi>able</hi> to make
  good against the <hi>Ablest Baby-Baptist</hi> that is among you, I know no men
  under the Sun more guilty, then you <hi>Clergy men,</hi> who take your
  advantages to cry out the lowder against it as <hi>error,</hi> by the defects
  of <hi>Christs</hi> Disciples that plead and practise it, of whom you say
  <hi>commonly,</hi> as you say <hi>complementally</hi> of your selves here, they
  have more <hi>zeal,</hi> then <hi>abilities</hi> to maintain it; yea verily
  you, who seem here, whether more <hi>simply</hi> or more <hi>simulatorily</hi>

  is here intimated to us in <hi>your</hi> own book; and likewise that
  <hi>your</hi> cause, which is so far from a <hi>good one,</hi> that it deserves
  to bear the name of <hi>Abaddon,</hi> is in danger of suffering so much through
  <hi>your</hi> defects in disputing it, <pb n="52" facs="tcp:42067:33"/> unless men be so
  <hi>charitable</hi> as to wink at the weaknesses of both? I speak serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in

  it in the same weakness, (onely robbing <hi>your Respondent</hi> of the
  strength of his <hi>Answers)</hi> in which it discover'd it self at first, and
  hang it out against the Sun, so that all men may see clean through it (so
  <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>thread-bare</hi> it is) and that without
  <hi>spectacles,</hi> and not <hi>onely</hi> so but make proclamation of the
  <hi>weakness</hi> of <hi>your Arguments,</hi> with a petition to pardon the
  weakness of them: that's an ill <hi>bird,</hi> which <hi>in hast</hi> bewraies
  his own nest, and leaves it to others to make all clean, and such are they that
  uncover their own <hi>nakedness</hi> so far, when they need not, that they are

  they are not <hi>Christ'n creatures</hi> till they have their

  been so rubd up of late, that they have been forc't to find more witnesses,
  indeed more then the Scripture affords to stand by them at their
  <hi>Bason-Business,</hi> and how eagerly they agree altogether in one

  e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one hath by <hi>Roat,</hi> and by <hi>Root</hi> of heart, and at fingers

  they take it out of, <hi>viz. They brought little children to Christ, by his
  permission, that he should touch them, and to such belongs the Kingdom of
  heaven, Ergo, Infants in infancy must be baptized,</hi> the consequence of
  which, as tis no less then this, <hi>they brought sick folks unto Christ, by
  his permission, that he should touch them, and to such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the Kingdome of
  heaven, Ergo, sick folks must be baptized in the time of their sickness,</hi>
  so it swayes not me, if it be somewhat more then that of the <hi>Papists, viz.
  they brought an Ass for Christ to ride on, Ergo, Asses are blessed

your first piece of <hi>Patch, viz.</hi> your <hi>True Ac-count-erfeit</hi> of
the <hi>Disputation,</hi> I address my self to a <hi>Disproof</hi> of your
<hi>Disputation</hi> it self, which I take all men to witness, is such a
cloudy, crooked, confused, self confuting, indefinite <hi>Mingle-mangle,</hi>
and mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mess of <hi>Argumentation,</hi> as was seldome or never (I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my self) set forth to be <hi>viewed,</hi> and <hi>reviewed</hi> from the pens
of professed <hi>Disputers.</hi> I shall first say a word to it in generall,
and then to each Argument in it's order.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Generale praecognitum,</hi> which I would have you and all
men take notice of is this, first either that you do not <hi>dispute,</hi> but
rather most miserably <hi>mis-pute</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the <hi>Question,</hi> as
stated between us, and the <hi>Position</hi> you took upon you to prove, which
was only that <hi>Infants of believers are to be baptized</hi> (as is laid down
in the second <hi>Proposition</hi> pa. 1.) for you run on all along in such
<hi>generall</hi> terms, <hi>viz. Children, Infants, little ones, little
infants, little children,</hi> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never naming the term of
<hi>believing parents,</hi> which ought of right to have been exprest in every
<hi>Argument</hi> that past you, in order to distinction of those
<hi>Infants,</hi> whose cause onely you plead, whose peculiar right to
<hi>Baptism</hi> you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to prove, from all other Infants, <hi>viz.</hi>
of <hi>Infidels,</hi> or <hi>unbelievers;</hi> and this I observe is your
manner in all your discourses, for when ever you come to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute</hi> this
point, you state your <hi>question</hi> still in terms too narrow, and such as
are no more <hi>adaequate</hi> to your proofs, then to your practise; for in
your question you dare affirm no further, then that such children only as are
born of <hi>believing pa rents,</hi> are to be baptized, but as your practice
over reaches this by far, while you dispense your

                  </item>
               </list> to all infants, even those of such parents, who in your
preachings are noted for no believers, so in your proofes you overlash as much,
and shoot far more wide from your <hi>Principle,</hi> and profess'd opinion,
which is that no infants, but those of believers, have right to
<hi>Baptism,</hi> when yet you huddle over all in such indefinite language as
pleads the baptism of all infants as well as some.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:42067:37"/> Or else secondly, if yee will needs have us
to understand you all along as mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>believers infants</hi> only, in
contradistinction to all other infants, to whom your selves say
<hi>baptism</hi> at all belongs not, then you and all may see how curiously you
come off, how egregiously your <hi>genius</hi> hath gull'd you all along, for
verily if mine own <hi>Minerva</hi> may be credited by me, there's not one inch
of <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> dictated to you, nor tittle of <hi>consequence</hi>
brought by you for the evincing the right of the one to baptism, <hi>viz,</hi>
the <hi>Infants of believers;</hi> but if it tended truely to such a purpose,
it would tend as truely, and undeniably to evince the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the
right of baprism to <hi>unbelievers Infants</hi> also, to whom (in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence)
you deny it as well as we: yea I appeal to all rational men in the world to
judge, whether you have brought one argument in either your <hi>Account,</hi>
or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,</hi> which may not as well be used (though thats ill enough
too) on behalf of one of these sorts of Infants, as to the clearing their right
to baptism, as of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
            <p>There is but four <hi>general heads</hi> (for all the rest of your
proofs are but <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> to one or other of these) from whence you
inferr not only that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to baptize <hi>believers Infants;</hi> but
also that it is wickedness to deny it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, The being, and appearing of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to be
in <hi>Believers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Deteriorty</hi> of the Gospel-Covenant
Comparatively to that of the Law, if when little infants of the <hi>Iews</hi>
were all circumcised, little infants of <hi>believing parents</hi> may not now
be baptized.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Desperateness</hi> or <hi>Cruelty</hi> that is in
the denyall of <hi>Baptism</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> of <hi>believing
parents,</hi> or the destructiveness thereof to all hope of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in
the hearts of their parents, and down-right endangering their
<hi>Damnation</hi> (so dying) if <hi>baptism</hi> be denyed them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The practise of the <hi>Universall Church,</hi> which
having for many hundred years together administred <hi>baptism</hi> to infants,
may not without <hi>damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blasphemy</hi> be once thought to have erred so
long a time, in so necessary a matter as <hi>baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which four considerations (not to speak as yet of their utter
invalidity to prove the <hi>baptism</hi> of any infants at all, for so I must
do by and by) I am now to shew how they do not a jot more prove the
warrantableness of baptizing of <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers infants,</hi> to whom we deny
that Ordinance, then of the infants of very <hi>Infidells,</hi> and
<hi>unbelievers,</hi> to whom your selves <hi>Doctrinally</hi> deny it
also.</p>
            <p>As for the last, which ile begin with first, and so go back to
that which is first indeed, <hi>viz. the practise of the universal or
Catholique Church;</hi> I confess indeed that what you, and the <hi>Pope</hi>
too do call the <hi>universal Church, viz. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,</hi> or to use your
own phrase, the <hi>Christian</hi> world, which with me ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, and hath
been for many ages <hi>Antichristian,</hi> that vast voluminous <hi>Church
body,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall Empire,</hi> or seven headed, ten horned
<hi>universall beast,</hi> that the Whore, or <hi>C C Clergy</hi> hath so
<hi>universally bejaded,</hi> this hath <hi>universally baptizid,</hi> or
rather but <hi>rantized infants,</hi> universally I say, not only in respect of
time, and place, <hi>i. e.</hi> in every nation, province, and parish within
her <hi>Verg,</hi> in every age of her <hi>Reign,</hi> but also in respect, of
the subject, <hi>viz.</hi> all infants that are born in those several nations
of what parents soever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>believers</hi> or <hi>unbelievers,</hi>
without exception, and by so much more to infants of very <hi>unbelievers</hi>
then of <hi>believers,</hi> by how much (as your selves witness in your
pulpits) <hi>Christs flock</hi> in respect of the rest, that are none of his,
even in <hi>Christendome</hi> it self, is but a <hi>little flock,</hi> yea and
the number of <hi>unbelievers,</hi> in the very Protestant, and most reformed
nations of it, which dispense <hi>baptism</hi> to infants as universally as the
other, is even many to one surpassing the number of <hi>believers:</hi> But
<hi>Sirs,</hi> what is all this to you purpose, I say to your purpose, which 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42067:37"/> is to prove by example of the <hi>universall Church,</hi>
the practise of <hi>baptism</hi> to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believers</hi> onely?
Suppose this, which you mistake so to be, were the true <hi>Church of God</hi>
indeed, and that her practise were set for our example, and such a true
<hi>Topick,</hi> as <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> make it, from whence
to fetch good warrant to do the like, yet I pray <hi>Sirs,</hi> doth it not as
well warrant the <hi>baptism</hi> of <hi>unbelievers infants,</hi> against
which you plead, together with us, as of such infants as are born of
<hi>believing parents</hi> only, the <hi>baptism</hi> of which infants on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
you plead against us? will you argue from the <hi>universality</hi> of the
<hi>Christian</hi> worlds doings to the particularity of your own sayings, as
if the <hi>universal baptizing</hi> of all <hi>unbelievers infants,</hi> as
well as others in all <hi>Christendome</hi> were an Argument <hi>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>b exemplo,</hi> and a plain; <hi>As
for Example,</hi> that the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believers</hi> only are to be
baptized? <hi>Sirs,</hi> what if a man were minded <hi>in jest</hi> to become a
fool so far, in order to the convicting you of folly, as to maintain against
you, who deny it, that not <hi>believers infants</hi> onely, but those of
<hi>unbelievers</hi> also must be baptized, and should argue this <hi>ab
exemplo,</hi> might he not (as D. <hi>Featly</hi> saies to us in another case)
kill <hi>you</hi> with <hi>your</hi> own <hi>Dudgen dagger?</hi> for seriously
<hi>Sirs,</hi> as far as that example is of force, it overturns your turn, who
use it, in the thing in order to which <hi>you</hi> alledge it, and overthrows
you clearly in <hi>your</hi> question, as <hi>you</hi> state it, and in
<hi>your</hi> tenet of a right to <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> for only <hi>believers
infants;</hi> exemplifying rather, if the example were to be heeded, the
baptizing, not of such <hi>infants only</hi> as are born of <hi>believing
pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> which we are against, but such as are born of <hi>unbelieving
parents also,</hi> who se <hi>baptism your</hi> selves are against, as well as
we.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ad hominem</hi> therefore I conclude, and <hi>ab exemplo</hi>
on behalf of <hi>unbelievers infants,</hi> as <hi>your</hi> selves do from the
same head on behalf of <hi>believers infants on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> thus,
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To hold that the <hi>universal Church,</hi> or <hi>Christian</hi>
world hath erred in so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary a matter as <hi>baptism,</hi> for so many
hundred years, is little less than <hi>damnable blasphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to hold it an error to <hi>baptize</hi> the infants, that are
born of <hi>unbelieving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> is to hold that the <hi>universal
Church,</hi> or <hi>Christian world,</hi> which hath <hi>baptized</hi> in
<hi>suo genere</hi> such as well as others, hath so longerred, in so necessary
a matter as baptism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo</hi> to hold it an error to baptise the infants that are

            </p>
            <p>Another Argument whereby you strive to evince <hi>your</hi>
opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of believers infants</hi> above other
<hi>infants,</hi> and to evade ours, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of
baptism</hi> to them both alike, as <hi>desperate</hi> and <hi>ungodly,</hi> is
drawn from the danger of their damnation if it be denied them, and the
<hi>destructiveness</hi> of that denyal to all that hope, that else may be had
of their salvation, which if it be of force, doth it not cry out as loud
against <hi>your</hi> desperate, and ungodly cruelty on behalf of those
millions of innocents of infidells, <hi>dying infants,</hi> to whom in
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and doctrinally <hi>you deny baptism</hi> as well as we, as it doth
on behalf of <hi>believers infants,</hi> who are no more innocent then the
other, to whom we deny it also? for if it be such a business, as not we, but
you, and the rest of the right <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Priests</hi> seem to make it, the
denial of which, <hi>de jure &amp; facto,</hi> damnes so down-rightly the
<hi>infants dying</hi> without it, that there's <hi>no hope</hi> to be had of
their salvation, so <hi>you say,</hi> or else my <hi>shallow noddle</hi> cannot
reach the profoundity of your purpose, in pettering out that pure pious piece
of sense which with this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of <hi>yours</hi> is stuffed pag. 13. then
its high time, as high a degree of <hi>charity</hi> as <hi>you</hi> would be
thought to have towards a few <hi>infants, viz.</hi> one of a hundred, for
scarely so many are true <hi>believers infants</hi> to the rest, to plead for
the baptism of <hi>unbelievers infants</hi> too, and stand up in the cause of
those <hi>innumerable</hi> poor <hi>babes,</hi> that cannot speak a word for
themselves against your <hi>Cruelties,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <pb n="62" facs="tcp:42067:38"/>
baptism to them, and deny all <hi>hope</hi> of their <hi>salvation</hi> to whom
(they so <hi>dying)</hi> it is deni'd: <hi>yea verily Sirs</hi> perswade us to
that once, and make us believe that <hi>popish trumpery,</hi> that the
<hi>deniall</hi> of <hi>baptism</hi> to any <hi>infants</hi> doth so much as
<hi>doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> damn them, and then I'le plead for <hi>baptizing</hi> of
<hi>infants</hi> in a larger way then you who confine it to <hi>believers
infants onely, viz.</hi> for the <hi>baptism</hi> of all <hi>babes</hi> and
<hi>sucklings</hi> in the world, and that least they die, and so be damn'd
before it be dispensed to them so soon as they are well out of the womb: so far
are we from that <hi>cruelty</hi> to <hi>infants,</hi> which <hi>you
(commonly,</hi> though not <hi>properly)</hi> charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, that if we
thought as <hi>you</hi> think (but <hi>Sirs</hi> mistake us not, for we have
good ground to act more <hi>charity</hi> then <hi>your</hi> selves do to all
<hi>dying infants)</hi> could we think I <hi>say</hi> that their
<hi>salvation</hi> did so depend upon their <hi>baptism,</hi> that their
<hi>damnation</hi> would be the issue of denying it, we durst not be so
<hi>desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruell</hi> as <hi>your</hi> selves, nor limit it to some one
infant of an hundred, know <hi>Sirs</hi> we are tender in our construction of
the condition of all that die in such <hi>minority</hi> as you
<hi>sprinkle</hi> in, before they have known or done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the rgood or evil, and
are well assured there's no <hi>damnation</hi> to such, of what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents soever
descended, and as little need of your <hi>Rantism</hi> to their salvation; but
for you who are so seemingly <hi>compassionate</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> to
a few, how <hi>churlish</hi> are you to a hundred to one, whilst your <hi>cruel
doctrine</hi> (excepting such as are born of believers onely) curses all the
rest unavoidably to hell? you talk much of your own <hi>charity</hi> to
infants, and our <hi>cruelty;</hi> but truly <hi>Sirs</hi> I dare tell you that
your <hi>tender mercies</hi> to that age of <hi>infancy</hi> are meer
<hi>cruelty,</hi> so long as in your <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish dotage</hi> on some, you
send so many packing to perdition; and as <hi>unchristian</hi> as our
<hi>cruelty</hi> is, it hath more tender mercy in it to the whole
<hi>infancy</hi> of the world, then all your <hi>Christian charity</hi> doth
yet amount to; for as you prescribe it p. 5. 'tis our rule indeed, but not your

and hope well, even the best things, and things that accompany salvation of all
<hi>infants,</hi> as well as some, specially <hi>since it cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi>
that any of them <hi>have</hi> yet <hi>by any actual sin bard themselves, or
deserv'd to be exempted from the general state of little children declared in
Scripture,</hi> which is <hi>a right to the Kingdome of heaven:</hi> but your
<hi>Christian charity</hi> hath not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried you out so farre yet, as to
<hi>hope</hi> and presume well of <hi>infidels infants, unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
infants,</hi> or any <hi>unrantized infants,</hi> though it cannot appear that

<hi>baptize</hi> no infants at all, nor see warrant in the word so to do, yet
believe, and that not ungroundedly, nor as being more merciful then God shews
himself to be to them, the salvation of all that die in <hi>infancy,</hi> or
one who imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as sillily as your selves, that <hi>no baptism, no

<hi>limiters</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> grace, for the <hi>baptizing</hi> of all
<hi>infants</hi> in the world, or your selves, who supposing the same, <hi>i.
e. no hope</hi> to be had of their salvation to whom <hi>baptism</hi> is
denied, have yet no more pitty in you, then to dispute for the <hi>baptism</hi>
of <hi>believers infants onely,</hi> excluding all other <hi>infants</hi> from
it (in doctrine though not all in practise) which are no less then an hundred
to one, whereby not a <hi>moity</hi> onely but all, save a small <hi>moity</hi>
of <hi>infants</hi> in the world, <hi>yea,</hi> in the <hi>very Christian
world,</hi> in which the most <hi>by</hi> far are <hi>unbelievers,</hi> are cut
off at once from not the <hi>Church</hi> on earth onely, but all share in the
<hi>Kingdom of heaven</hi> also, which of all these I <hi>say, viz.</hi> we,
he, or <hi>you,</hi> are most <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>desperate,</hi> and <hi>do
most justly deserve the censure</hi> which <hi>you</hi> Priests put upon us, p.
15. of <hi>your</hi> pamphlet <hi>of damning infants dying, contrary to evident
testimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and of damning innumerable innocents,</hi> such as
infants of infidels are, <hi>whose right to the Kingdome of heaven our Saviour
declared;</hi> I propound it to be considered by <hi>your</hi> selves, and all
other men at leasure; at present, seeing this <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42067:38"/> Argument of
yours makes also more against then for you, whose plea is for some
<hi>infants</hi> against other, if your <hi>Minor</hi> in it, <hi>viz. that
denial of baptism to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants destroyes all hope of their salvation</hi> were
true, as it is not, and speaks for a necessity of <hi>baptizing</hi> all
<hi>infants,</hi> and not <hi>a few onely,</hi> I'le <hi>Syllogize</hi> it back
upon you in much what your own terms, and so pass hence to the other.</p>
            <p>That opinion which destroyes <hi>all hopes</hi> of the
<hi>salvation</hi> of many dying infants to one in the world, yea, in the very
<hi>Christian</hi> world too, is a most desperate, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, uncharitable
opinion.</p>
            <p>But the opinion of you <hi>Priests,</hi> who deny <hi>all
hopes</hi> of <hi>salvation</hi> to those to whom <hi>baptism</hi> is deni'd,
and yet <hi>deny</hi> it <hi>doctrinally your</hi> selves to all
<hi>unbelievers infants,</hi> which are many to one in the <hi>Christian</hi>
world, and dispute for its dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation to <hi>believers infants</hi> onely,
is such as destroyes <hi>all hope</hi> of the <hi>salvation</hi> of many
<hi>dying infants</hi> to one, as well in the <hi>Christian</hi> world as
elsewhere, <hi>Ergo,</hi> the opinion of you <hi>Priests</hi> is a most cruel,
desperate, ungodly, uncharitable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>Another fine fancie, whereby you would fain juggle men into a
belief that <hi>believers infants</hi> and these <hi>onely</hi> are to be
<hi>baptized,</hi> runs thus, else (say you) the <hi>Gospel Covenant</hi> is
worse then that under the <hi>law,</hi> forasmuch as then <hi>litle
infants</hi> were <hi>circumcised:</hi> Now <hi>Sirs,</hi> when I come to
meddle with this Argument ore again I shall shew you plainly the imbecillity of
it to prove the <hi>baptism</hi> of any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> at all, and the
<hi>meliority</hi> of the <hi>Gospel-Covenant</hi> above that of the
<hi>law,</hi> though <hi>infants</hi> be not now <hi>baptized</hi> as
<hi>Circumcised</hi> then; at present I am to shew how, if it would prove any
thing, it would prove the right of <hi>baptism</hi> to unbelievers infants, to
whom you deny it, as well as to believers infants, whose <hi>baptism</hi> onely
you seem to plead by it: I say <hi>suppositively</hi> that this is to make the
<hi>Gospel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> worse then that of the <hi>law,</hi> to deny baptism
to infants now, sith they then admitted infants to Circumcision, then the
denial of it to believers infants, which is your own opinion, makes it worse
then it was under the <hi>law,</hi> as well as the denial of it to infants of
believers, for under the <hi>law</hi> the infants of unbelievers, which were
many to one believer among the <hi>Iews, Is.</hi> 53. 1. were both <hi>de
jure</hi> and <hi>de facto circumcised,</hi> as well as those of the
<hi>believing Iews,</hi> and so by your own rule ought the one to be baptized
now as well as the other: Again by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of <hi>baptism</hi> to the
infants of unbelievers, not onely a <hi>moity</hi> but the <hi>most</hi> of
<hi>Christendome,</hi> as in which are by far more unbelievers infants then
others, are cut off at once from baptism and membership, I conclude therefore
thus.</p>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> opinion which
denies baptism to little children, makes the Gospel-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant worse then that

all unbelievers infants, whereby not a moity onely, but most of the Christian
world, in which the most are unbelievers, are cut off from being members of the
Church, makes the Gospel-Covenant worse then the <hi>law.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> thy opinion which denieth baptism to all

            </p>
            <p>Another curious conceit, whereby you undertake to clear the right
of baptizing the infants of believing parents above others, is the being, and
plain, yea more plain appearing of the holy spirit to be in these children then
in others, or then in men, whom we baptize that make profession, which plain
and sufficient appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (so you stile it p. 5) of the spirits being in these
children, is made (say you) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies, First by these infants faith,
Secondly, by these infants holiness, Thirdly by those Eulogies that are given
to these children in Scriptures, not inferiour to those <pb n="64" facs="tcp:42067:39"/> of
the best Saints. Fourthly, by that Scripture in special 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.
know you not that the <hi>Spirit</hi> (that <hi>Christ you</hi> should have
said) is in you except <hi>ye</hi> be <hi>reprobates,</hi> lastly and mainly by
these childrens non-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing not to have the spirit, by these childrens not
appearing to be evil; by these infants not appearing <hi>by any</hi> actuall
sin, to have barr'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or deserved to be exempted from the general

               <p>First its delivered in <hi>tam dubiis terminis,</hi> such a
  dubious and indefinite form of speech, <hi>viz. little children,</hi> not at
  all expressing <hi>what children,</hi> nor <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers children</hi>
  distinctly from others, but all alike, which muddling expression of the
  subject, of whom <hi>you</hi> praedicate this that they have the <hi>holy
  spirit,</hi> is made well nigh every where else throughout <hi>your</hi> book,
  and possibly on purpose to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that absurdity from being too apparent,
  which unless you dream'd out this <hi>Disputation,</hi> a more determinate
  delivery of <hi>your</hi> selves all along in these terms, <hi>viz. infants of
  believers,</hi> you foresaw would light upon it; Nevertheless, as
  <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely</hi> and <hi>implicitly</hi> as <hi>you</hi> set down
  <hi>your</hi> subject, <hi>you</hi> cannot hide the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof let your
  meaning be what it will, for <hi>you</hi> must take it in some or other of
  these senses, <hi>viz. all little children have the spirit,</hi> or
  <hi>unbelievers little ones onely have the spirit,</hi> or <hi>believers little
  ones have the spirit,</hi> or <hi>some children have the spirit but we cannot
  tell which;</hi> nor whether these more then those, or those more then these,
  the <hi>spirit being neither bound to all the children of believing parents,
  nor barred from any of the children of infidels: you</hi> cannot understand it
  of <hi>unbelievers children</hi> only, nor <hi>yet</hi> of all children, nor
  <hi>yet</hi> of <hi>unbelievers and believers children</hi> promiscuonsly, so
  as to say some of these and some of those, but in particular it cannot
  certainly be presumed which, though he that reads your eighteenth page, where
  you confess there can be no conclusion made, which have it, and which not, can
  hardly tell how to take you handsomely in a better sense, for then all men will
  say <hi>fie upon it,</hi> how miserably do these <hi>Logicians</hi> labor all
  along besides their question, they propound the <hi>baptism of believers
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> only, but proceed to prove the <hi>baptism of all children,</hi>
  or of <hi>unbelievers children</hi> onely, or at least of <hi>unbelievers
  children</hi> equally with the other; they plead to have none but <hi>believers
  infants baptized,</hi> yet affirm the <hi>holy spirit,</hi> the supposed being
  of which in these infants is the main ground on which they would have these
  only baptized, to be in all infants, at least in other infants (for ought
  <hi>they</hi> know) as well as these; <hi>yea</hi> even in those infants, even
  <hi>Infidels</hi> infants, whom <hi>yet</hi> they would not have baptiz'd, so
  partial and cruel are <hi>they</hi> to these, though the denial of
  <hi>baptism</hi> to poor infants (in their own opinion) destroies all hope of
  their salvation: but if <hi>you</hi> take it for little infants of believers
  only, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which only the question was stated, then every wise man will
  wound <hi>you</hi> as much on the other hand, and <hi>say</hi> thus how
  miserably do these men fumble about their business, both proving and practising
  more then themselves believe to be the truth; they assert infants of believers
  <hi>only</hi> have the <hi>holy spirit,</hi> and undertake to prove it in
  contradistinction to other infants, <hi>yet</hi> produce nothing more towards
  the proof of it, then what tends, if it do tend indeed to such a purpose, to
  prove it <pb n="66" facs="tcp:42067:40"/> to be in all infants as well as those, how
  egregiously do these Priests gull and cheat their people, they profess the holy
  spirit to be in no infants, save those onely that are born of believing
  parents, and that these onely are thereupon to be baptized, and yet practise
  (another thing under the name of) baptism to unbelievers infants in their
  parishes, whom they truly judge not to have the spirit, in common with those
  whom as blindly they judge to have it, <hi>i. e.</hi> not the seed of true
  believers only, but the seed of true and apparent unbelievers also.</p>
               <p>The second fault I charge upon your <hi>Minor Proposition</hi>
  is an utter falseness in the matter affirm'd in't, for take the term <hi>little
  children</hi> for what <hi>little ones</hi> you please, these or those, tis
  utter untruth to utter any such thing as that <hi>infancy</hi> have the
  <hi>holy spirit,</hi> much more that <hi>believers infants</hi> have it more
  then others, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any strength in any one thing you have presented
  the world with to prove either one of these, or yet the other: and howbeit I
  say <hi>suppositively,</hi> that all appear to have it, if any at all, by what
  you have here produc'd in proof on't, yet I'le positively prove, and partly by
  way of answer to your own argument, that neither

                  </gap>ll <hi>infants</hi> have the
  <hi>holy spirit,</hi> nor any at all, in such <hi>non-age</hi> as you falsly
  supposing they have it, do thereupon baptize in: to this end I would I wist
  what you mean by the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> (as you call him, but I all along the

                  </gap> else you would not predicate him to
  be in infants, in such wise as here you do; I'le indeavour therefore to search
  out what your meaning may be, by á serious survey of the senses which
  the <hi>holy spirit</hi> seems to be taken in in the word, of which I am
  confident, if you know what you mean, you must mean one.</p>
               <p>The spirit which is but one and the self same in
  <hi>substance</hi> where ere he is, is yet spoken of in Scripture in two, and
  but <hi>two different senses</hi> in general, so far as I find, and that
  answerably to <hi>two different offices,</hi> which he exercises towards
  <hi>two different kinds</hi> of men in the world, <hi>viz.</hi> godly and
  wicked, believers and unbelievers, Saints and sinners; these two several
  offices, which that one <hi>holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is found in towards these
  severall sorts of men, are either more <hi>common</hi> or more <hi>special,
  general</hi> or <hi>peculiar;</hi> the common or general office of the spirit
  is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and inlightes, draw, move, perswade, strive with men to bring
  them into the way of obedience to God, and of their own good, and this he
  executes univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally to all men, and in this sense is in all men and women,
  good and bad, godly and wicked, Saints and sinners, Jews and Gentiles,
  Christians and heathens, but not in the <hi>one day old infants</hi> of any of
  all these (that I know of.) The will of man, even every man, so soon as he
  comes to such capacity as to be able to discern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good and evill, stands
  ever after, even all the daies of his life, between <hi>two wooers</hi> that
  sollicit him, and seek to win him to their service, and which ere wins him
  (finally) to its service will everlastingly and accordingly reward him with
  life or death <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 17. to v. 23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8. And these
  two are <hi>mans flesh, and Gods spirit,</hi> which are evermore lusting in him
  one against the other, and between them perswading him (each in their kind) in
  this sense he is in the blindest heathens that breath on earth <hi>(natural
  fools and infants</hi> onely excepted, of whom as far as nothing is required,
  because nothing revealed, so far they have nothing to answer for) yea the very
  Gentiles which have not any law in an outward letter, as we have, are said
  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. to <hi>be a law unto themselves,</hi> and to <hi>shew
  the work of the law written in their hearts;</hi> and to have their
  <hi>conscience</hi> and <hi>thoughts witnessing</hi> within, <hi>accusing</hi>
  and <hi>excusing</hi> one another, which can be no other (though commonly
  call'd the light of nature) then a light from God and Christ, who is said to
  <hi>enlighten every man that cometh into the world,</hi> and so doth more or
  less, even such as never yet knew his person (as the <hi>Sun</hi> sends some
  light in some corners of the earth, where the body of it is not at all
  discerned) yea the very spirit of God shining and striving in them, answerably
  to which <hi>Gods spirit</hi> is said <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. to strive with man, even
  those evill men of the old world that <pb n="67" facs="tcp:42067:40"/> rebell'd against it,
  by which <hi>spirit Christ</hi> himself is said to have preacht to those
  disobedient persons, while the long suffering of God waited on them, in the
  daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> whose outward ministry he also used, while the
  <hi>Ark</hi> was preparing 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19, 20, the same spirit is said
  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. to be sent to <hi>convince</hi> the very <hi>world of sin,
  righteousness and judgement,</hi> yea the stiff-necked and uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
  <hi>Iews</hi> both in heart and ears are said <hi>Act.</hi> 7. alwayes to have
  resisted the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirit,</hi> which they could not have done had he not
  wrestled with them, yea within them, thus farre all men have him, even ill men,
  the worst in the world, at some time or other, by which <hi>spirit</hi> the
  <hi>Son of righteousness</hi> is the light of the <hi>Microcosme,</hi> or
  inward world of mans heart, as the <hi>Sun,</hi> by the beams that stream from
  the body of it, is the light of the <hi>Megacosme,</hi> or outward
  uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
               <p>In this sense I cannot conceive you take the holy spirit here,
  or if you do, you mistake not a little, if you say infants have him thus, for
  howbeit, in these ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wayes of his acting all persons male and female may
  be said to have him at the years of capacity to distinguish, yet infants of one
  day old have him not in this sense, or if they had 'twill make no more for the
  baptism of them then of all men and women in the world, much less have they him
  in those special waies of acting, in which he acts in the Saints, till at least
  they come to be so far past that mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as to be sensible of his acting
  towards them.</p>
               <p>Which speciall and more eminent acts and offices of the spirit
  are on this wise, <hi>viz.</hi> special assisting in doing good, when by common
  strivings with them men are perswaded, and prevaild with to set about it, and
  when in his first motions he is obey'd; also comforting, supporting in and
  under troubles, trials, suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, temptations, persecutions, which will
  assuredly light on those that do obey him, assuring souls more and more clearly
  of Gods love and favour, witnessing to their spirits that they are the children
  of God, enabling them with boldness to cry <hi>Abba</hi> father, sealing them
  up to the day of Redemption, confirming them as an earnest in their present
  confidence of a future inheritance, kingdom, glory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing to them more
  plainly the things freely given of God, so that they rejoice mainly therein,
  whilst others to whom these things are foolishness, rejoice in the things of
  the world, lusts of the flesh, and of the eye, and of the pride of life;
  lusting strongly against the flesh, delivering from the law of sin and death,
  war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring against the law of the members effectually, which else would carry
  captive to the law of sin; mortifying the deeds of the body, teaching all
  things, leading into all truth, guiding and gifting persons for the Churches
  service severally as he will, bringing all things to remembrance which Christ
  spake, which are subject to be forgotten, manifesting the Father, the Son, and
  many more things to them that love Christ and keep his commandements, which he
  will not manifest to the world, nor to any of those in it that do not, and
  other such like precious perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, in all which he officiates peculiarly
  towards the Saints onely that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him, not wicked resisters of him; to
  which Saints, or true Disciples of the Lord Jesus, he was promised to be given
  under the Gospel in a fuller measure then in former daies, and sent to be their
  comforter (whilst to such as entertain him not, but a bare convincer) in which
  respect he is call'd the spirit of promise, as being promised in this sense to
  all those that obey Christ, that believe, repent, and are baptized into his
  name for remission of sins, and ask the father for him; and to be set as by
  office to minister in way of succor to the mournful spouse in the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms
  absence, to help poor soules that give up themselves to be lead by him, and
  accordingly was, is and ever shall be given to those that do not grieve, resist
  and quench him, and that are found observing all things that ever Christ
  commanded, non-observation of which disingages Christ of his promise, so that
  it failes not, though he be not with men that name themselves his Church, for
  ages and genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions together: In which senses he is not at all in infants in
  their infancy, neither <pb n="68" facs="tcp:42067:41"/> doth he at all, guid, or provoke
  them, how far forth soever he may guard and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, till they come to
  such capacity as to have good or evil fasten'd on them by perswasion, nor doth
  he any of the aforenamed good offices for <hi>infants,</hi> in whom there's yet
  no need they should be done, nor doth he delight ordinarily to be where either
  he must be idle (as he must in <hi>infants of one, two or three daies old)</hi>
  or (unless he work <hi>miraculously)</hi> imployed altogether to no
  purpose.</p>
               <p>As to that of <hi>Iohn</hi> concerning whom 'twas promised he
  should be filled with the <hi>holy spirit</hi> from the womb, besides the
  singularness and extraordinariness of the case, which renders it unfit for you
  to argue from, who deny that such exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are to be drawn in as an ordinary
  rule to judge by, and confess that <hi>ex particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari non est
  Syllogizari;</hi> I add moreover, that there's no necessity for such an
  im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate acceptation of that word <hi>[from the womb]</hi> as to make the
  sense of it thus, <hi>viz. [in the very moment of his birth]</hi> for it may
  well be taken, as elswhere the same phrase must be, <hi>viz, [so soon as ever
  he should be capable to receive it, and be assisted and guided by it]</hi>
  which might be in his tender years, but was not I believe in such meer
  <hi>non-age</hi> as you wot off, thus the wicked are said, <hi>Psal. 58. 3. ab
  alinare se ab utero, to estrange themselves from God from the womb, to go
  astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies, stopping their ears, not
  hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the voice of the Charmer,</hi> which terms do all denote
  <hi>actuall sinne,</hi> by which your selves confess <hi>infants</hi> cannot
  <hi>bar themselves p.</hi> 5. or <hi>deserve exemption;</hi> it must therefore
  be understood thus, <hi>viz.</hi> so soon as ever they are capable to do this
  or that, to take the right away or the wrong, or to know and act either good or
  evil.</p>
               <p>I assert therefore once again, that the <hi>spirit</hi> in this
  second sense is not in infants in their infancy, nor know I in what sense they
  can be said to have him, as to have right thereby to baptism, unless you can
  assign me some more senses out of Scripture, which if you can do, I shall tell
  you what to say to them, and as I cannot find they have the holy spirit in
  them, so neither find I any promise of the holy spirit in such non-age as you
  wot of, if by the spirit you mean the spirit of promise, as you must if you
  plead a right to baptism there from; and if you should refer me to
  <hi>Act.</hi> 2. I find there no more made to any then to all; indeed its said
  <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is to you and your children,</hi> but I advise you to
  consider, first, that tis not said to you and your infants, neither are
  children and infants all one in significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the one expressing the age or
  rather non-age, the other the Relation to the parents, of whom they are born:

  the terms of faith, and the time of their believing, and yet all this while not
  be made to them and their infants, as in their infancy: moreover it appears
  most evidently that these parents were yet in unbelief, and bare inquiry after
  what they should do, having acted neither faith nor repentance as yet, when
  <hi>Peter</hi> said thus to them, <hi>repent and be baptized,</hi> and ye shall

  <hi>holy Spirit you</hi> mean (as <hi>you</hi> must else it serves not
  <hi>your</hi> turn at all to the proof of baptism) the <hi>spirit</hi> in that
  special sense, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>holy spirit of promise;</hi> the
  consequence from faith to the having of it will not universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold true, for
  as much as faith not only must be in time before it (unless God be better than
  his word, and that he may be when he pleases, and so he was <hi>Act.</hi> 10,
  44. where the <hi>spirit</hi> by <hi>Anticipation</hi> was given out before
  obedience at least in baptism, which yet by promise cannot be expected till
  after it <hi>Ast.</hi> 2. 38.) I say not only must be before it, but also
  <hi>may</hi> be a pretty while without it; this will be counted the <hi>mad

  of the <hi>Testament of Christ</hi> doth not tell <hi>you plainly,</hi> that as
  faith must be before it in an ordinary way, before we have warrant to expect
  it, so it may for some while be without it, and therefore cannot prove the
  <hi>holy spirit</hi> to be alwaies where it is; for the spirit of promise is
  given after faith, if given according to the promise, and so long after it too
  now and then, as is enough to make it undeniably appear, that the having of
  faith, is no proof of ones present having the holy spirit: among sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry others
  let those Scriptures be seriously searcht into, <hi>Ephes. 1. 13. In whom after
  ye believed ye were sealed with the holy spirit of promise, Act. 19. 2. have ye
  received the holy spirit since ye believed? they answered no, also Act. 8. 12.
  when they believed, &amp;c. they were baptized, &amp;c. but verse 16. the holy
  spirit was fallen upon none of them, only they were baptized, Act. 5. 32. The

  promised nor (as by promise) to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but upon obedience in faith,
  repentance, turning to God, baptism and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Pro. 1. 23. Act. 2. 38.
  Luke 11. 15. Iohn</hi> 7. 38. 39. the places are so plain to the purpose, that
  i'le not disparage your judgement so much, as like a fresh man to stand to
  frame formal <hi>Syllogisms</hi> to you out of them: to conclude then as to
  your <hi>Consequence,</hi> had you argued from the <hi>holy spirit,</hi> in the

  correction, but sith you began at the wrong end of your business, I beseech you
  take it for a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Sirs</hi> and begin again.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I deny your <hi>Antecedent,</hi> which if <hi>your

  these are infants indeed? Secondly, are you sure they were infants of believers

  little ones literally taken at all, as I know none there is, yet I am sure
  there is none that they were the little ones of believers he then spake of, in
  contradistinction to the infants of unbelievers; for tis not specified either
  one way or other, and is most probable that the child he occasionally called to
  him might be some unbelievers child, or other, the number of believers, where
  e're he came, being few, and not comparable to them that believed not, but what
  e're that child was yet this is much more then probable, that by the term
  <hi>these little ones</hi> in v. 6. he means not infants but his
  <hi>Disciples,</hi> whom, having first perswaded them to become such as that
  little one, or as little children in such things as are gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally found in
  them, <hi>viz.</hi> plainness of spirit, humbleness, innocency, freedome from

  a weaned child,</hi> from that <hi>Analogy</hi> that was and ought to be
  between little ones and them, he here bespeaks (as it was very ordinary for him
  to do) under the title of [these lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ones] besides the <hi>plurall
  number</hi> he speaks in implies he spake of such of whom there was a
  plurallity then present, for saith he these little ones, pointing as it were to
  more then one, but there was but one little one then in the midst of them of

  him, yea as well in as from his mothers womb, though he was never sensible of,
  nor acquainted with it, so as to hope it in the womb, but the whole creation
  also figuratively, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 19, 20, 21, 22. is said to <hi>groan, wait,

  because they have need of his protection, and all the help they then have comes

                  <hi>Sirs,</hi> give me leave to make an answer by these ensuing
  Interrogatories, and I'le expect your Answer to them again; had the
  <hi>children of the Iews faith?</hi> and did God himself witness that they had
  it, by setting Circumcision to them as his seal of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> (for
  thats the sense in which you take the word seal) to assure men that they had
  it? and is it the consequent that the children of believing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have it
  now? let me then ask you.</p>
               <p>First do you conclude that all the children of believing parents
  have it now? that I think for shame you will not say, sith every experience
  witnesses the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; or that some believers children have it now, therefore
  all believers children are to be baptized? and if so, that is as silly an
  inference, as if you had argued thus, <hi>viz.</hi> some people believe
  therefore all must be baptized,</p>
               <p>Secondly, had the Jews children faith? first I wonder how they
  came by it, sith the word saies faith comes by hearing, and how can there be
  believing on him of whom they have not heard? and how can they hear without a
  preacher? and how can they preach except they be sent? and how can they be sent
  to preach to infants that understand not what is said? except you say (as you
  are fain to do, not for want of blindness p. 18.) that <hi>infants have an
  hearing, and the <pb n="73" facs="tcp:42067:43"/> spirit works upon them miraculously, and
  yet not extraordinarily neither, but in that ordinary way as he doth on
  men,</hi> in the <hi>conversion</hi> of whom you say the spirits working is but
  ordinary, and yet miraculous too, which <hi>Popish Bull</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves well to
  be baited, but ile fotbear to fall upon it, till I meet it in its proper place
  in the <hi>Review.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when had they it begotten in them? in the womb? or if
  after birth, on what day on the 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, or
  8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>? for on some of these they received it, if on the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day they were (as
  <hi>you say they</hi> were) <hi>circumcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> in token that they had it;
  but I muse, and am yet to learn on which, and so are your selves too I believe,
  for all your confidence in asserting it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, was <hi>Circumcision Gods</hi> witness, yea
  <hi>Gods</hi> seal to assure men of thus much, that those children to whom it
  was set had faith?</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Risum teneat is amici?</hi> did you ever read or hear
  that <hi>circumcision</hi> was set to infants to this end, <hi>viz.</hi> to

  seal not so much to witness, or assure men that he had faith, as to honor that
  faith, that more <hi>evidently,</hi> and <hi>eminently</hi> then ordinary he
  had before, with that famous title <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Father of the

                  </hi> therefore
  circumcision as given to <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. is not said
  to be the seal of the righteousness of faith (as you cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly rehearse the
  words leaving out the residue of the verse, which makes them relate to

  <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> posterity) but a seal of the righteousness of the faith,
  <hi>i. e.</hi> that famous faith which he himself had, and to this end that he
  might be (as none of his meer flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seed ever were) the Father of all them
  that believe. Secondly, if <hi>circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> were Gods witness that these

  <hi>significa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ions,</hi> must also
  with you be Gods witness to others that those infants to whom it is dispensed
  have faith also, and if so then I must make bold to ask you two things:</p>
               <p>First, Is not this <hi>round about our coal fire,</hi> to prove
  two things no otherwise then one by another? for when you prove that children
  are to be circumcised, or <hi>baptized</hi> (which with you is all one, who
  falsly call baptism (as <hi>Paul</hi> doth not in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. for he
  means another thing by that phrase, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the heart) the
  <hi>circumcision without hands)</hi> I say when you prove, that children are to
  be circumcised either one way or other in answer to our why? you say because
  they have faith and thereby right to the Covenant, and the seals of it; but
  when you come to prove that children have faith, which we deny, you say tis
  clear because they have circumcision, and baptism, which are Gods witnesses,
  seals or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences to us that they have it: this is not <hi>Idem per
  Idem,</hi> the same by the same, that is too <hi>effeminate</hi> a probation,
  but tis <hi>eadem inter se,</hi> or <hi>per se invicem,</hi> the same things
  reciprocally by each other, and well nigh as <hi>womanish</hi> as that; for
  whether is it better to say they have it because they have it, or to
  <hi>say</hi> it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent they have this because <hi>they</hi> have that,
  and that being as much doubted to clear it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> it is apparent
  they have that because they have this; and if <pb n="74" facs="tcp:42067:44"/> these two
  <hi>viz.</hi> faith and baptism, faith and Circumcision, did <hi>ponere se
  invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem,</hi> so that one could not possibly be without the other, they might
  the better <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare se invicem,</hi> but 'tis not so, for as <hi>faith</hi>
  may possibly be where neither <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi> nor <hi>baptism</hi> are
  dispensed, witness the thief on the <hi>Cross,</hi> so ther's nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them
  but may be, and is too too much dispensed where faith is not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, let me ask you, is <hi>Gods</hi> witness,
  <hi>Gods</hi> testimony true, or is it false? for say you God himself did
  witness it, that the children of the Iews, <hi>i. e.</hi> in infancy had faith:
  false you dare not say it is, nay you do not, but rather p. 5. that <hi>his
  testimony</hi> as to the truth of it, <hi>is to be preferred before mans,</hi>
  yea I say let God be true, and every man a liar, but if it be true, how then
  appears it to be so, if your testimony be not false? how then came it to pass
  that the most of the <hi>Iews</hi> and their children sucessively in all
  generations had not faith when they came to years? for it's most evident that
  most of them were unbelievers, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could not enter into their
  rest; but their carcasses fell in the wilderness; I know but two shifts you can
  make, and 'tis much at a pass which you take, for you will contradict your
  selves in either of them both, for surely, either they fell from that grace (as
  those infants do also whom you sprinkle from that faith which (as you say and
  seem to see) once they had) and this flatly contradicts your own doctrine of
  <hi>impossibility of falling from faith,</hi> or else they never had any such
  faith as you say they had in infancy, and then either <hi>Gods witness</hi> of
  such a thing must be <hi>a lye,</hi> which what horrid <hi>heresie</hi> were it
  to think, and <hi>abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blasphemy</hi> once to utter? or else
  <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Circumcision</hi> never witnessed such a thing, and that
  flatly contradicts <hi>your Antecedent,</hi> and so your selves will be found
  <hi>false witnesses</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> because you have testified of him
  that he himself did witness by <hi>Circumcision,</hi> that the children of the
  <hi>Iews</hi> had faith, when he never wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed it at all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the fourrh grand <hi>Interrogatory</hi> is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sirs,</hi> what children of the Jews had faith in their
  infancy witnessed by <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> were they the children of the
  <hi>believing</hi> or <hi>unbelieving</hi> Jews? for you are shy me thinks of
  expressing too often which you mean, and proceeed as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely,</hi>
  that you may deceive as <hi>indiscernably</hi> as you can, if of the
  <hi>unbelievers</hi> then is not this goodly disputing, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Children of the unbelieving Iews had faith and
  circumcision.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo, children of believing Gentiles onely have faith, and
  must have bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Is not this goodly doing (if 'twere your practise as
  strictly as 'tis your <hi>plea)</hi> to <hi>baptize</hi> onely <hi>believers
  children</hi> now upon their own faith, because <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers children</hi>
  of old were circumcised upon their own faith? this straitens the grace of God
  under the Gospel, in comparison of the largness of it under the law, for then
  all children of unbeliving Iewes were circumcised by his appointment, as well
  as the <hi>infants of believers;</hi> Answerably to which, if you go by that
  rule, you should conclude thus, <hi>uiz.</hi> all the Gentiles children should
  be baptized now, as well those of unbelievers as believers', but you turn out
  unbelievers children from the priviledge, that unbelievers children had before,
  but if you say children of believing Jews onely had faith then, therefore of
  believing parents now, then first how doth your Argument and proof drawn from
  Gods witnessing by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision that there was faith in the Infants, hold any
  more to the proof of it in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers infants, then in unbelievers, for he set
  Circumcision to the infants of the <hi>wicked and unbelievers</hi> among the
  Jews as well as of the <hi>godly and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, how doth it appear at all that godly and believing
  parents children then had faith more usually then children of ungodly parents?
  when good <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> had two vile sonnes <hi>Hophni</hi> and
  <hi>Phineas,</hi> good <hi>David,</hi> wicked <hi>Absolom,</hi> good
  <hi>Solomon,</hi> wicked <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> good <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> wicked
  <hi>Ioram,</hi> good <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42067:44"/> 
                  <hi>Iosiah,</hi> wicked
  <hi>Iechoniah</hi> and his brethren, &amp;c. when contrariwise wicked
  <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi> begat good <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> wicked <hi>Abia,</hi> good
  <hi>Asa,</hi> wicked <hi>Amon,</hi> good <hi>Iosia,</hi> which shews that faith
  is not entail'd from parents to posterity as you would make it.</p>
               <p>Thus I have spoken to your first way, wherby you prove
  <hi>Infants of believers</hi> to have the <hi>spirit,</hi> and thereupon right
  to <hi>baptism, viz.</hi> their faith, and to a first and second of those
  whereby you seem to prove them to believe, there is yet a third way whereby you
  would make men believe that Infants of believers do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>viz.</hi>
  their <hi>Iustification,</hi> without which there is no <hi>salvation,</hi> but
  because that's not inserted here at all, but toward the end of the
  <hi>disputation,</hi> and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted most vigorously in your Review, I will
  suspend the prosecution of that head, till I come thither, and proceed next to
  a consideration of the second, third, fourth and fifth ways, as they lie in
  order, whereby you would prove believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to have the spirit, above the
  infants of unbelievers.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Disputation.</head>
               <p>The next thing whereby you offer proof of it that infants of
  believing parents onely (remember these still are the subject on which you
  pretend to proceed, and predicate that these denominants, <hi>viz.</hi> the
  spirit, faith, holiness &amp;c.) that these I say have the holy spirit, is
  their holiness from whence you confess here that there was no Argument taken,
  that is to say, 'twas not proved, and yet a little above p. 3. in the fourth
  and fifth line of this <hi>sum, aliâs</hi> some of your disputation, you
  as <hi>blindly</hi> as <hi>boldly</hi> bolt it out, that it was proved by their
  holiness: the Apocali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptical beast that was and yet was not, scarcely seems
  more Apocriphal to you, then this was and was not of yours seems Apoplexical,
  or brainsick to me: This <hi>True-ly</hi> might have been rankt among the rest
  in your true Account, but to let it passthus, this cannot but be granted for a
  truth, that you made as if you would have proved it by their holiness, that
  infants of <hi>believers</hi> have the spirit, but did not, because I wisht you
  (but (fool that I was) I have been sorry since that I did at all wish you) to
  forbear it, for as I was not affraid to give way to your proof then (save onely
  that I was well aware you would but trifle) so since I marvelled a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more
  upon the matter, I have found it of more facillity to prove <hi>(infants-sprin
  kling</hi> by the <hi>popes holiness,</hi> whose <hi>mandamus</hi> it is, then
  by any holiness of their own.</p>

               <p>Ile muse a little if you will, now I am upon it, by what kind of

               </p>
               <p>But 'tis not the first, for <hi>secundum te</hi> at least (O

               <p>

  again, by your own confession these are not capable in infancy to act either
  good or evill, yea instruction of the understanding must go before any actings
  be, yea weigh but your own expressions a little p. 18. of your
  <hi>Pamphlet</hi> where you tell us thus much in plain terms, that
  <hi>instruction of the understanding in matter of faith in some sort, must go
  before any act of faith can be discovered;</hi> to which I fully assent, and
  add, that <hi>instruction of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding in matter of holiness,</hi>
  (and this infants are not capable of) <hi>must go before any act of holyness
  can be discovered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If <hi>you say</hi> the third, then pray tell me three
  things.</p>
               <p>First, How its discovered to you, or how you know that theirs
  such a <hi>habit of holyness</hi> infused into believers infants in that
  <hi>non-age</hi> whereupon you build your boldness to <hi>baptize</hi> them?
  for by the fruits only it is that we can know persons <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 6. to be
  good or evil, and <hi>you</hi> confess pag. 8. that <hi>infants have not the
  exercise and fruit of faith,</hi> and commonly in <hi>your pulpits</hi> that
  <hi>holiness</hi> is the fruit of faith, and <hi>Iames</hi> challenges any one
  if he can to shew him his faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his works, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 18. yea
  <hi>you say</hi> plainly that the <hi>seed of faith sown after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovers it
  self when the season comes p. 8. and that no judgement of science can be
  passed, till the acts themselves be seen, and examined for</hi> a posteriore
  <hi>only</hi> (mark that word <hi>only) the discovery of habits is made,</hi>
  these are your own sayings in <hi>your Review</hi> p. 18. whereby you plainly
  <hi>unsay</hi> all that here <hi>you</hi> say of believers infants faith, and
  holiness, for if it be so that the discovery of these habits is only <hi>a
  po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriore, i. e.</hi> by the fruits, exercises, and acts, and that
  <hi>Infants</hi> have not these, then how I trow have <hi>you</hi> the
  discovery of it at all, before the season, that these habits are in them?
  <hi>yet</hi> such is your shameless inconsiderateness, and custome of
  contradicting <hi>your</hi> selves, that <hi>you</hi> pretend to a
  <hi>discovery</hi> of it so farr as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt here the discovery of it to the
  world: will <hi>you</hi> allwaies feed the world thus with your own groundless
  fancies, and fashion it in religion according to <hi>your own</hi> careless
  conception? will <hi>you</hi> alwaies affirm things so to be, and venture to
  make them known, and <hi>yet</hi> confess they cannot be known too? <hi>O curas
  hominum o quantum est in rebus mane!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, pray tell me how this holiness, which you assert to be
  in believers infants whereby <hi>you</hi> would make it appear that they have
  the <hi>spirit,</hi> doth appear any more to be in them then the
  <hi>spirit</hi> it self; are they not both a like dark to us, and unapparent?
  <hi>yet you</hi> profess to prove the one of these by the other thus, they have
  <hi>holyness</hi> therefore the <hi>spirit,</hi> and if to one querying, how
  you know they have <hi>holiness?</hi> you should say thus they have the
  <hi>spirit,</hi> therefore <hi>holyness,</hi> 'twere a <hi>proof</hi> no more
  <hi>impregnant</hi> then the other, for <hi>you</hi> could do more then leave
  the people, whose <hi>blind guides you</hi> are, as much in the dark as before,
  by this, and by that I am sure you do no less: when men fall to proving (as you
  have done hitherto all along in <hi>your Disputation)</hi> things
  <hi>undiscernable</hi> by things as <hi>undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable</hi> as the other, and
  things that appear not at all, by things that appear no more at all then those
  they would make to appear by them, 
  <q> 
                     <l>Nescio an anticyram ratio illis destinet omnem.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, I pray tell me how this holiness appears to be in
  believers infants whom thereupon you would have to be baptized, more then in
  unbelievers infants whom (though in <hi>your practise you</hi> promiscuously
  admit them with the other <hi>yet)</hi> in <hi>your proofs you</hi> except from
  your baptism? is there any more <hi>Specimen</hi> or shew of holiness in them
  then in these? the best spectacles that ever I beheld with, could never behold
  it; Is there any <hi>more capableness</hi> of such an <hi>Infusion</hi> of
  ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, or of having such an habit infused? Is there any <hi>experience</hi>
  of it when they come to years that the infants of believers had this holiness
  in their infancy and unbelievers infants had not? if so, how is it that when
  they are grown, the children of unbelievers have holiness very often, when as
  oft the other prove wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and have not? (have a care of your shinnes (good
  now) by all means) <pb n="77" facs="tcp:42067:45"/> do the children of believers fall from
  it? is there any promise of God, whereby he stands ingaged to infuse holiness
  into these infants in infancy, when he will not infuse it into the other? and
  if so, how it is it that <hi>we must necessarily hold</hi> (for so <hi>you say
  your</hi> own selves in <hi>your Review</hi> p. 18.) <hi>that God is not
  bound</hi> (for if he hath promised it as <hi>you say</hi> he hath
  <hi>Acts</hi> 2. then he is bound) <hi>to work it in all the children of
  Christian parents, nor barred from working it in any of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of
  infidels?</hi> Is there any <hi>promptness</hi> to acts of holiness, whence
  only <hi>you</hi> can clearly argue <hi>ad positionem habitus,</hi> in that
  infancy in which <hi>you</hi> sprinkle them, in believers infants then in the
  other? all <hi>your</hi> skill in <hi>Physiogmony</hi> can never find it: or
  can <hi>you</hi> argue <hi>ad negationem habitus,</hi> to no holiness in an
  infidels infant more then in anothers? <hi>your very</hi> selves acknowledge
  you cannot: if not, why more I wonder <hi>ad negationem spiritus? why</hi> more
  <hi>ad ne gationem baptismi? why</hi> more <hi>ad negationem nugationis istius
  vestrae, viz.</hi> your trivial <hi>new way,</hi> or rather <hi>no way</hi> of
  baptism? to which if it were baptism indeed, you must admit, if not all, then
  not at all in time of infancy, or else <hi>your</hi> absurdities are
  unsuffrable, <hi>Sirs</hi> suffer me to come cross to <hi>you,</hi> and hit you
  home with your own <hi>cross interrogatory</hi> p. 18. are those infants of
  infidels, between whom, and those of believers, <hi>you objectors</hi> will
  admit no comparison, inclinable to acts of holiness? or not? if the former, it
  presupposes then that infidels infants have the habit also as much as the
  other, and so the working in them, and those born of believing parents may be
  one, and so their holiness, and faith, and spiritualness, and baptism be one
  too, which all <hi>your Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> doth deny; if the latter, I freely
  confess these are not inclinable, nor <hi>yet</hi> the other neither.</p>
               <p>These premised the Answer is in your own very words pag. 18.
  <hi>That unless it could be certainly presumed what children have the
  habit,</hi> i. e. <hi>of faith, holiness, what have not, the working of the
  spirit is not known to us, he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound nor barr'd there can be no
  conclusion made,</hi> and therefore <hi>Quis nisi mentis inops</hi> &amp;c. how
  justly may they be concluded by themselves, as well as by others, to have
  <hi>hand plus cerebri quam cimax sanguinis,</hi> and no more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
  then those whose right eye is utterly darkned, who premising these sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
  themselves, do for all that make this conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> that these
  infants have faith, Holiness, the Spirit, and thereby right to baptism above
  all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Or secondly <hi>Sirs</hi> do <hi>ye</hi> mean by it some
  <hi>Negative</hi> holiness, consisting in their being without sin, and having
  yet no wickedness, and prophanness, the thing, which (and more properly by
  farr) <hi>you</hi> stile <hi>innocency</hi> in the next words? though yet <hi>o
  curious criss-cross</hi> you will not hold them guiltless neither: if so, for
  <hi>my</hi> part I give <hi>you</hi> in <hi>my</hi> assent to it, that infants
  are innocent, but I cannot help it if it do <hi>you</hi> no good in
  <hi>your</hi> cause, for first are infants of believers <hi>any</hi> more
  innocent in time of infancie then the rest? how so? not by birth, for they are
  all alike born in sin, <hi>secundum te,</hi> not in life, for it cannot appear
  that the one have more blurr'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or <hi>barr'd themselves by any
  actual sin</hi> from baptism (if innocency be that which intitles to it) then
  the other</p>
               <p>But secondly to say the truth <hi>Sirs</hi> so far is baptism
  from being intailed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents, and holy ones only, as their only right,
  that it belongs rather only unto sinners, for though Christ for examples sake,
  and for other ends, submitted to it, who yet had no sin of his own, but he had
  ours by imputation, yet the most proper use of it to all else that submit is to
  signifie the <hi>remission of their sins Mat. 3. 6. Luk. 3. 3. Act. 2. 38.
  Act.</hi> 22. 16.</p>
               <p>If believers infants therefore be so <hi>righteous, holy,</hi>
  i. e. <hi>innocent, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>you</hi> make them, and I dare not deny
  but that they are, nor dare I saie otherwise for the world of other infants in
  infancie, having more <hi>charity</hi> than <hi>your</hi> selves, even so much
  as to presume <hi>unumquem<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> bonum nisi constet de malo, they</hi> are so
  little inrighted to baptism thereupon, that till they sin <hi>they</hi> are
  much rather exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="78" facs="tcp:42067:46"/> from it: for if baptism be a sign to
  signifie to him who submits to it, the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his sinnes in
  plurali,</hi> (as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. and in all other places it seems to be)
  thenits utterly usless to such (and therefore to infants) as, being yet under
  no <hi>Commission of sinnes,</hi> need yet no sign of <hi>Remission</hi> of
  them.</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>Matrimonial</hi> holiness I call that, which
  arises from the <hi>conjugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>two viz,</hi> one man and one
  woman only into <hi>one flesh,</hi> according to <hi>Gods</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinance
  and institution; the subject of which holiness is not onely <hi>marriage</hi>
  it self, and the <hi>marriage bed,</hi> which is said to be <hi>honourable</hi>
  among all men, and <hi>undefiled,</hi> or which is all one, to be <hi>holy,
  Heb.</hi> 13. 4. but also the <hi>married persons</hi> of what rank, quality,
  religion soever, when once come into that <hi>conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall</hi> relation, whether
  both or either or neither of them be believers; and the <hi>seed</hi> or
  infants that are born of them in that condition, which are called by
  <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. a <hi>seed</hi> of his own seeking,
  a <hi>godly seed,</hi> or <hi>seed of God,</hi> which he owns as truly,
  lawfully, honestly, holily begotten, according to his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointment,
  and not basely, beastly, trecherously, adulterously, nor corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as those
  are which arenot begotten in the bed.</p>
               <p>Opposite to this holiness, these holy ones (I mean the married
  couples, and their holy seed) are all the lusts of concupisence, objected on
  strange flesh; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 7. adultery, fornication, and
  unclean agents, <hi>i. e.</hi> adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers; and the unclean issues of the
  adulterous bed, <hi>viz,</hi> the adulterous brood, or the seed of the
  adulterer and the whore <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 3.</p>
               <p>This kind of holiness I dare say you do not mean, yea the most
  of you will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perswaded that there's any such kind of holiness at all,
  or if you be it makes nothing for your purpose, for what if infants of
  believing parents be (as infants of unbelieving parents also are, when begotten
  in lawfull wedlock) holy in such a sense, doth this tend at all to prove them
  to have the holy spirit, which is the thing in hand? yet this even this, and no
  other is all the holiness meant by <hi>Paul</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. where he saith,
  <hi>else were your children unclean, but now are they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that very
  place which your selves so often send us to, for proof thereof, when we deny
  your Antecedent in this consequence, <hi>viz. Infants of believers are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
  therefore to be baptized:</hi> This that I say as 'tis not deni'd (to my
  knowledge) by some that are for infants baptism, so is it most undeniable to
  any that will but plainly and impartially consider the direct drift of the
  Apostle in the verse, which is not any such matter as to shew that there's such
  a sanctity in the unbelieving hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or wife of believing yoke-fellows (for
  these are there said to be holy as well as the children, with the same
  holiness) and in their children also, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolles them all, <hi>viz.</hi> the
  unbelieving parties, and the children, as well as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving parties in the
  Covenant of grace, or in any such outward Church cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as inrights them to
  baptism, membership and fellowship in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to shew such a
  sanctity or holiness, as clears both their conjunctions, and conceptions to be
  pure and guiltless, such as frees their bed from the account of baseness, and
  their brood from the account of bastardy, both which in the sight of God and
  men would else be unholy, <hi>i. e.</hi> utterly unlawful and un clean: his
  scope is (I say) to convince them of the lawfulness of that state, <hi>i.
  e.</hi> of a believer and unbelievers being man and wife together, by the
  lawfulness of the seed that proceeds from them, and by both these not onely of
  the liberty and legality, but the duty also of their continuance together in
  that civil marriage relation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding their different religion, as
  well as if they were in Religion one and the same: The Corinthians had written
  to him (it seems verse 1) about many cases; wherein they were scrupled, and
  among the rest about this, <hi>viz.</hi> whether a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or wife comming
  into the faith, and leaving their yoke-fellows still in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; might
  lawfully own and cleave to them still, as their true and lawful yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellows,
  as before they did, when they were both in unbelief, or as they may one to
  another that are both in the faith, or whether they must not rather leave them 
  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:42067:46"/> now, and disown them as to that old capacity, because of
  this spiritual difference that now was between them, in answer to which he
  tells them, that by all means if the unbelieving parties will be pleased still
  to abide with them, as before, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving parties must not depart, nor put
  away; and to satisfie them further in so doing, he renders them this good
  reason, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>the unbelieving wife is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in, or to the
  husband, and the unbelieving husband to the wife,</hi> which is as much as if
  he had said, you are as true man and wife in the account of God as before, your
  marriage is an honourable, your bed as undefiled as before, your unbelieving
  husband or wife sanctified as a lawful companion to you as well as before, your
  living and lying together is as holy, and unblameable in the eyes of God as
  before, and to put this more out of doubt yet, least any should remain
  un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved, he minds them further by another argument <hi>(ab absurdo)</hi>
  the absurdity which they it seems were too inconsiderate of, that would follow
  upon it, if this were not so, for else (saith he) your children are unclean;
  <hi>else</hi> (that is) if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your selves in this case of different
  Religion to be lawful man and wife together, you heed not (for wise men do not
  at all times see the ill consequences of things at present, as Mr.
  <hi>Tombes</hi> well observes, and as stark m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saies page 87. of his <hi>Baby-book</hi>
  the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, if they did not mind this) you heed not what mad
  work you will make by so doing, hereby you will deny your children to be a
  lawfull issue; you will bring the <hi>blame</hi> of <hi>baseness</hi> upon your
  <hi>begettings,</hi> and the <hi>blot</hi> of <hi>bastardy</hi> upon <hi>your
  off-spring;</hi> for all men know (though at all times it may not come into
  their minds, nor then possibly when ther's most need it should) that by the
  same reason that the parents are not holy in their coming together, nor
  sanctified one to another by the ordinance of God, <hi>viz.</hi> true and
  lawful <hi>matrimony,</hi> the babes begotten and born of them, cannot be that
  godly seed, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15: but must be base born and unclean, and this
  the Apostle here hints unto them in this clause, <hi>else were you children
  unclean,</hi> thereby evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing or evidencing to them, who doubted of it, the
  warrantableness of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in their <hi>marriage</hi> contract: but now
  saith he, <hi>i. e.</hi> though you are one in the faith, and the other in
  unbelief, yet your children are holy; and honestly born for all that (as else
  they could not) and you consequently holy pure, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in your
  <hi>communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I cannot but note by the way how egregiously Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> pedles in a long prate to Mr, <hi>Tombes</hi> page 86, 87.
  about an impossibillity of the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> knowing their seed to be
  legitimate, and yet doubting their <hi>marriage</hi> to be unlawful, whereas
  they might in general know it, and yet in special at this time not be so
  serious in considering it; and how impossible it was for <hi>Paul</hi>
  rationally to argue from the effect to the cause, so as to go about to convince
  them of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of their marriage, by a consideration of the lawfulness
  of their seed, which flowes from lawful marriage, and is a consequent, of which
  that is the cause: whereas <hi>in cognitione (praesertim confusà)
  effectus sunt priore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> causis:</hi>
  in order to such knowledge as the <hi>Apostle</hi> seeks here to beget them to,
  which was but as it were a certain remembrance of what they might have easily
  gathered of themselves, had they not been so forgetfull as to need a
  <hi>memorandum,</hi> 'tis not irrational to clear the <hi>cause</hi> by the
  <hi>effect,</hi> as to say there's <hi>smoak,</hi> therefore there's
  <hi>fire,</hi> yet the fire is the cause of the smoak, <hi>these infants</hi>
  are no <hi>bastards,</hi> but <hi>legitimate,</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their
  <hi>parents</hi> were married is the very same.</p>
               <p>This therefore I say again is all the holiness here intended. As
  for that <hi>federall holiness</hi> you fiddle men in the ear with as the
  <hi>only holiness</hi> here aim'd at, I confess I once rawly uttered it in
  discourse my self, when being a <hi>sprinkler of infants</hi> (as you are) and
  as stiff a stickler for that practise as the blindest among you, <hi>I</hi> was
  made choise of to defend it against the <hi>Baptists,</hi> who not by force of
  <hi>Armes</hi> (as the <hi>Priest-hood</hi> once did) but by force of
  <hi>Arguments</hi> at last overcame me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their way, but as I was then pretty
  well faulted for fastening such false constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <pb n="80" facs="tcp:42067:47"/> as of
  a faederal holiness on that place, so upon a more serious search into its
  sense, I have found it my self so faulty, that if I had said a <hi>fiddlestick
  holiness,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> had been but
  somewhat more ridiculous, so far is <hi>Paul</hi> from dilating on any such
  kind of holiness in that <hi>Scripture,</hi> where to convince them of a
  mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> civil <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,</hi> and
  to shew that <hi>different Religion</hi> destroies not any <hi>civil
  relation</hi> is verily the very utmost of his errand.</p>
               <p>To inculcate this <hi>yet</hi> a little more upon <hi>you,</hi>
  let me press <hi>you</hi> to lay to heart these few considerations.</p>
               <p>First that, as here in this fourteenth verse he shews that the
  civill relation, or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive</hi> holiness of the state between man and
  wife is not nullified by a difference about the faith, so but that they may
  abide together therein, though one be a believer, and the other an infidel,
  without any sin or guilt contracted to the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by such continuance in
  their contract, so in the following verses he shews that the civil relation, or
  civil sanctity of the State between <hi>Master</hi> and <hi>Servant</hi> is not
  nullified thereby, so but that they may lawfully live together in that state,
  though the <hi>Servant</hi> should be a believer, and the Master an infidel; or
  the <hi>Master</hi> a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever</hi> and the <hi>Servant</hi> an
  <hi>Infidel</hi> ve. 21. <hi>art thou called being a Servant, i. e.</hi> to an
  unbelieving master, <hi>care not for it, i. e.</hi> distract not thy self about
  it, scruple it not solicitously, as if it were an unholy, unclean, unlawfull,
  or sinfull state for thee to remain in, for v. 22. <hi>he that is called in the
  Lord, i. e.</hi> to the faith being a <hi>Servant, i. e.</hi> in bondage to a
  Master not yet called, <hi>is Christs free man, i. e.</hi> acceptable to
  <hi>Christ,</hi> even in that state and relation to such a Master as before;
  and in the favour of <hi>Christ,</hi> as also <hi>he that is called being
  free,</hi> or a Master himself is <hi>Christs servant, i. e.</hi> one whom he
  owns for his, accepts and justifies, though happily he may be by covenant in
  relation still to unbelieving servants, he is holy, honorable, and undefiled in
  his state as a Master, and that by virtue of the Ordinance of <hi>Christ,</hi>
  who hath sanctified that condition and relation of Master, and Servant to each
  other, as holy for them to abide in together, though in <hi>Morall</hi>
  respects the person of one of them may be holy, and the other wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The very like to which <hi>Pauls</hi> hints in his exhortation
  to servants, even of unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving masters, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1. where he bids
  <hi>believing servants</hi> that are under the yoke, though to <hi>unbeliving
  Masters</hi> (for in that he saies &amp; they that have believing
  <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> inv. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it argues that he means such as have
  <hi>non-believing Masters</hi> in the first) That they should count them worthy
  of all <hi>honor</hi> because they are their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters still, by the ordinance
  of God that hath set and sanctified them in their place and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ation as <hi>honorable and holy,</hi>
  though in their persons and practise they may be <hi>contemptible, vile,</hi>
  and <hi>ungodly;</hi> the like he saies to <hi>Christians</hi> concerning civil
  <hi>Magistrates,</hi> though infidels, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  apart as <hi>his Ministers</hi> for civil good, they are to have a reverend,
  honorable, and even holy estimation of them in their hearts, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in
  their subjection to them in matters civilly righteous, even for conscience
  sake.</p>
               <p>The like he saies to children that are in the

  their parents, they are to honor as those, who are by right of <hi>Divine</hi>

  this difference of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>unbelief,</hi> when it falls out
  between man and wife, Master and servant, which two he instanceth in only in
  this chapter, he gives a general direction to all sorts of persons in every

                  <hi>The Parents are sanctified by the faith one of the other,
  not so as to be in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant themselves by their sanctification, nor yet so as
  to be baptized thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but they are sanctified as a holy root, so as to
  bring forth a holy issue, that hath, by vertue of its holiness, a right to the

               <p>Then it seems the <hi>unbeliever</hi> is with you a <hi>holy

  holy as well as the other parent, yea so holy, that by that concurrence the
  child is in covenant and to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p>First, do you not say somtimes that the child hath its holiness
  from the believing party onely, as if there were no influence passing from the

  you, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing</hi> parents are sanctified, so as
  to be holy <hi>Roots</hi> to their children by the faith of their <hi>believing

  that let go one more, <hi>viz. Act.</hi> 2. 38. 39. which must be handled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

  will be removed, a matter of no small tendency to its ruin, or else lets see in
  you <hi>rejoinder,</hi> for I put these things upon you by way of
  <hi>quaere,</hi> expecting to see (if by silence you give not the cause) how
  well you will <hi>distinguish</hi> your selves out of the briars, which your
  opinion upon the place brings you into, and how well you will wind your selves
  out of those many absurdities, which you are led aside in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to from the way of
  truth, by the extravagancies and cunning concavities of your crooked <hi>logick
  lane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, let it be considered that the holiness here predicated
  of the unbelieving parent and the children, is not such as is the result of the
  <hi>faith, and faederal holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the believing parent, (as is so
  frequently asserted among you) but of the <hi>marriage Covenant,</hi> which
  being holy by institution, and honourable among all, and undefiled, gives the
  denomination of civil sanctity to the unbelieving couple and their seed, as to
  a couple of believers, and their seed, as also the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of honourable
  in an unbelieving magistrate and master a rises, not from any <hi>praise worthy
  qualification</hi> in their persons, much less in the persons of the
  <hi>Correl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives,</hi> as you say the holinesse of the unbeliever doth from
  the faith of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, but from <hi>Divine ordination</hi> which
  constitutes them as holy in their places, this will be evident,</p>
               <p>First, if you consider the manner of speech here used by the
  Apostle, who saies, not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>unbeliever</hi> is sanctified in the <hi>believing wife,</hi> and
  <hi>believing husband</hi> but in the <hi>wife,</hi> and in the <hi>husband, i.
  e.</hi> in her being his wife, and his being her husband, and howbeit its true,
  which is commonly return'd to this, <hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis the believing wife
  of the unbelieving husband, and the believing husband of the unbelieving wife,
  when the marriage is between <hi>believers</hi> and <hi>unbelievers,</hi> yet
  the believing party is not here preferred before the unbelieving parent, as to
  the conferring of this holinesse upon the issue, but they are said to be both,
  and that by your selves, who confesse they jointly make <hi>one holy root,</hi>
  equall in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and are sanctified, not one by the faith of the
  other, as you suppose the unbeliever to be by the faith of the believer, but
  both by the <hi>ordinance of God, viz.</hi> their <hi>marriage</hi> each of
  other, so that they both alike do sanctifie the issue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you consider the true genuine proper direct
  tendency and weight of this <hi>Relative</hi> particle <hi>[else]</hi> which if
  you allow it a right reference, relates not to the faith or believing of
  either, but to their being true man and wife, to the lawful <hi>wedlock</hi> of
  them both; for that which is the ground of your error about this place is the
  forcing of this particle <hi>[else]</hi> the wrong way, for <hi>Else, i.
  e.</hi> (say you) if one of the parents be not a believer, then the children
  are unclean, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the sense of it runs thus, vix. <hi>else i. e.</hi> if you
  be not holy in your copulations, if you be not sanctified one in, to, and by
  the other as lawful man and wife, by your union formerly contracted,
  notwithstanding your now disunion in Religion, then your children are unclean,
  and this is truth, for so the children are in this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil sense, if begotten,
  and born out of <hi>matrimony,</hi> whether the parents be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or no,
  bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the other is not truth, for
  whether both or but one or none of the parents believe, the infants for that
  cause alone, and without respect to <hi>matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> are in no sense ere
  the more holy or unclean.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and this will yet appear more plainly, if you consider
  that faith alone in either one, or both the parents begetting <hi>out of
  wedlock</hi> cannot sanctifie the seed so begotten with this <hi>civil
  holiness</hi> here meant, no nor with that <hi>faederall holiness</hi> you
  plead for, nor could it do so even then, when that holinesse or birth
  privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you talk of was in force (as now it is not) <hi>viz.</hi> in the
  daies of the law; for if two believers came together then, out of marriage
  their seed were not onely <hi>base born</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">See Mr. Blake in birth priviledge p. 5.
 11.</note> and so unclean, in this our sense, but also to the <hi>tenth
  generation</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to be admitted into the congregation, and so
  consequently unclean even in your own, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 2. whereupon (how
  <hi>Pharez</hi> and <hi>Zarah</hi> were dealt with it matters not, sith they
  were born before the law was given) <hi>Ieptha</hi> was exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 
  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:42067:49"/> from any inheritance with his brethren, because he
  <hi>was</hi> the son of a strange woman, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11. 2. and
  <hi>Davids</hi> unclean issue by <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> that in the wisdome of God
  was taken away by death on the seventh day, might not surely, without breach of
  the law, have been accounted holy, and of the congregation, if he had lived
  beyond the eighth, whereupon your selves also are much fumbled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the
  holinesse of <hi>bastards,</hi> and the <hi>baptism</hi> of <hi>base-begotten
  babies,</hi> so that you scarcely know how to behave your selves about it,
  though the parents sinning be believers, at least <hi>en-churched</hi> in your
  Churches, yea its generally known (saith Mr <hi>Cotton</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">P. 87, 88. of the way of the Church in
 N. England.</note>) that our <hi>best Divines</hi> do not allow the baptism of
  bastards and though he is pleased to say they allow it not <hi>sine
  sponsoribus,</hi> without Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet I wonder, sith <hi>Deut.</hi> 23
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 2. Gods denial of such of old
  is made the ground of their denial of such now, to enter into the Congregation
  as unholy, that our Divines dare take on them to admit <hi>cum
  sponsoribus,</hi> and so to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their own Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> the order
  of things under the law, wherein God gave no such allowance, but to let that
  tolleration pass, which they take to themselves, <hi>you may</hi> learn thus
  much of <hi>your</hi> selves if you will, that though <hi>wedlock</hi> without
  <hi>faith</hi> make a holy seed in our sense, yet <hi>faith</hi> without
  <hi>wedlock</hi> in the parents can make a holy seed neither in our sense, nor
  in your own, nor any at all, for the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> of the <hi>married</hi>
  are <hi>holy;</hi> but <hi>believers bastards</hi> are both <hi>civilly,</hi>
  and <hi>fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unclean;</hi> inso much that your selves see cause to refuse
  as <hi>federally holy,</hi> the spurious seed euen of those, whose lawfull
  issue you unlawfully sprinkle.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if you more seriously consider, that the holinesse in
  the Infant here must needs be the fruit and result of that, and that must needs
  be the cause of the holiness here spoken of in the infant, <hi>quo posito
  ponitur sanctitas, sublato tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litur,</hi> which being in the parents. a
  holinesse must necessarily be thereupon, which not being in the parents, a
  holinesse cannot be in the seed: for <hi>positâ causà poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
  effect us sublata tollitur:</hi> abstract the cause and the effect cannot be:
  suppose the cause and the effect cannot but be: now that which if it be not in
  the parents the holiness is not, but being in them the holinesse is
  consequently in the infants, 'tis not the faith, but the <hi>conjugal</hi> or
  <hi>marriage</hi> Relation of the parents, for as for the first of these,
  <hi>viz.</hi> faith, it may be in one, yea in both of the parents, and yet no
  federal holinesse at all be in the infants, witness <hi>Ishmael</hi> the seed
  of <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful, and his Sons by
  <hi>Keturah</hi> also, born of him after Co venant made with him, and his seed
  in <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and yet neither of them in that Covenant,

  did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to <hi>Church</hi> ordinances, which once was, but now is a

  in whose parents faith was not found at all, for most of the Iews were
  unbeiievers, yet all their <hi>legitimate children</hi> were <hi>holy
  federally,</hi> therefore faith in the parent cannot be the cause of such a
  thing: yea if you will believe Mr, <hi>Blake</hi> himself, the strictest
  pleader for a <hi>birth-priviledge</hi> of federal <hi>holiness</hi> in
  <hi>Infants</hi> that ever I met with, and that from this very place, he

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nt is not the cause of this
  holinesse,</hi> whilst making the <hi>holinesse</hi> in this text to be a birth

               <p>Secondly, what will he get as to the point in hand by his
  <hi>Synonamizing</hi> faith and faederall holiness, for still neither the one
  nor the other is made here the cause of the holiness of the seed, for the
  holiness here spoken of may be where neither of them is, and may not be in the
  seed, even where they are both in the parent, as for example in <hi>Ezras</hi>
  time, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10, 3. we find abundance of the Jews, both Priests, and
  people, that were in the faith, or at least in faederall holiness, yet the
  children were put away as unholy, as well faederally as otherwise, because
  their <hi>marriage</hi> was unlawfull, and that <hi>bed adulterous</hi> wherein
  they lay with <hi>strange wives, Ezra</hi> 10. 3. and that both parents
  possibly may be faithful, and faeder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally holy, and yet their seed be in all
  senses utterly unclean is evident, for the child of two believing Jews begotten
  besides the marriage bed, was both a <hi>Bastard,</hi> and also barr'd from the
  Congregation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 2. again this faederal holiness as well as
  faith may be in neither parent, and yet the issue not be unclean, but holy
  still, and so are all <hi>(Matrimonially,</hi> and civilly at least) that among
  Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans are the issue of the <hi>marriage bed;</hi> and with the holiness of
  the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> too, when they come to years, and believe
  themselves, as not a few children of unbelievers do, and sometimes the seed of
  <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> this therefore <hi>i. e.</hi> the faith,
  or faederal sanctity of the one parent, nor of both cannot be the cause of this
  sanctity, is here denominated of the seed, for holiness in the infants is not
  alwaies, when this is, and sometimes it is in the infant, when this is not in
  the parent, which being of each without other, cannot be between a true cause,
  and its effect; but as for the second <hi>viz.</hi> the marriage sanctity in
  the parents, it is that which being in the parents, holiness is naturally and
  necessarily in the seed that is born of them, whether they be both or either,
  or neither in faith or unbelief, but being not in the parents, there can be no
  holiness, no <hi>birth holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in their infants, nor
  <hi>Matrimonial,</hi> nor <hi>Congregationall</hi> neither: therefore this is
  that which is the cause of the holiness of the issue in this Scripture, the
  result of which, and not of faith in the parents, is this non-uncleanness in
  their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and so I have done with this kind of holiness, and with this
  Scripture which speaks of this <hi>Matrimonial</hi> holiness and no other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ceremonial</hi> holiness, I call that same holiness
  which properly, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, and <hi>pro tempore</hi> only pertained to the

  onely to the believers but also to their bodily issue, as barely descending
  from them, <hi>qua sic simpliciter,</hi> and without their own personal faith,
  which in infancy appears no more to be in them then infants of unbelievers, and

  years and not in the other) declares them to be <pb n="90" facs="tcp:42067:52"/> heirs
  apparent thereof, when the other are not) then I say plainly that all

  themselves, <hi>Non est causa quo minus,</hi> &amp;c. is no cause whereupon
  they are a whit less the seed of believers after the flesh, and if so (and also
  that that only gives a title to the promise) then he that made that promise on

  being so born being fulfilled by all the natural seed of believers, be they
  never so ungodly in their own persons, must be faithful to fulfil his own part,

  and as well of all unbelievers in the world? for even the children of
  <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and all the children of all the men upon

  and obeying the Gospel themselves, when they come to years, whether their

  <hi>your</hi> believers seed above unbelievers, if <hi>you</hi> go this

  <hi>viz.</hi> either that believers children are heirs of salvation upon their
  fathers faith onely without their own, or if <hi>you say,</hi> not so but by
  their own faith tis that they must be saved, then that the Gospel promise
  belongs not to believers children beyond other mens, and that one mans seed
  hath no such birth-priviledge and preheminence as <hi>you</hi> dote of about

               <p>
                  <hi>We can easily answer you to all this by distinguishing upon
  the promise, thus, The promise of the Gospel is either of salvation, life
  remission of sins, the holy spirit, as the earnest, and the inheritace it self
  to come, or else of external pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges only, and participations of
  Ordinances, as Baptism, Churchmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship &amp;c. the promise of the eternal
  inheritance, life, and salvation we grant is not made, much less made good to
  any upon terms of the parents faith, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own personal belief, and
  obedience, but the promise of outward priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and of right to
  participation of ordinances, as to be baptized, and inchurch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, this belongs to children upon their
  fathers faith, so that believers children are children of the promise in this
  sense, when others are not, and in this last sense it is that</hi> Peter
  <hi>saies the promise is to you, and to your Children &amp;c.</hi> i. e.
  <hi>you and yours have the priviledge of right to baptism.</hi>

               <p>Then it seemes you quit the former sense, I pray therefore let
  us here no more of that till next time however, but let me tell <hi>you</hi>
  one thing by the way concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that first sense, before I say ought to your
  second; <hi>viz,</hi> that if the promise of salvation belong to persons upon
  their own personal belief and obedience (as undoubtedly it doth, according to
  the whole tenor of the Scripture as to men at years) and such onely, then as
  very a <hi>sigment</hi> of ours as you feign it to be, twill put you to your
  shifts, to find out what way dying infants are saved in, unless <hi>you</hi>
  own another way then that which the Scripture tenders it to men in, for the
  justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and salvation of infants, viz. the <hi>presentment of the
  righteousness of Christ for them without belief</hi> in them, or any other kind
  of obedience; And sith in such sense as this only you own the Gospel promise to
  be made by <hi>Peter Act.</hi> 2. to believers infants, <hi>viz.</hi> that they
  shall by right be admitted to outward privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as <hi>baptism</hi> and
  <hi>membership,</hi> when others shall not, I beseech you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what a poor
  piece of promise is made by him, and what a miserable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter the Apostle is
  made by you, in making as if this were all his meaning, and all that he intends
  by that precious word of promise; I suppose his drift was to support the Jewes,
  now smitten down under sense of sin, and the guilt of Christs blood which then
  lay upon them, by propounding to them some ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, but here is
  cold comfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t in what he saith, if
  that be all, which you saie is, the sense he speaks in, he had spoke little to
  their purpose, and as good he had said never a whit, as never the better; for
  this promise (as you take it) hath more matter of mourning in it then otherwise
  to say you shall be brought nearer to the <hi>Church,</hi> but never the nearer
  to salvation thereby, further then you do that which others doing, that are
  further off the <hi>Church,</hi> shall be saved so doing as well as you: Sirs
  you had as good cut off the <hi>entail</hi> of that piece of promise, which you
  intitle believers infants to, as cut of the best part of the promise from them,
  which yet you seem to entail as from their parents to them, for this is not
  worth a rush without the other, for abstract this great priviledge you seem to
  invest them with, from that which you divest them of by this distinction, and
  its worth little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if not plainly worse than nothing, without the
  other: what better to be under a promise of being priviledged with, and what
  priviledge at all to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this, and yet to be no more, nor upon any
  other terms under the promise of the inheritance it self, then others, such as
  were yet never at all signed to it: Is it not r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ther a burden and a bondage? for outward ordinances
  verily are part of the preceptory part of the Gospel, and the precept in point
  of ordinances, as well <hi>as</hi> in point of manners, is part of the yoke and
  burden of Christ, and of the hard sayings of his, which flesh and blood brooks
  not to hear off, for though the way of Christ is light and easie, and not
  grievous where it is lessened by thoughts of the recompence of reward, yet is
  it in it self a burden, and a yoke, and such a one too as considering the
  sufferings of all such as submit to own it, well nigh wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies them that walk
  under it, though under clearest title to the Kingdome, for which they suffer,
  much more may it be a misery, and not a mercy to such, who have a promise of
  being barely admitted to it, but no more of life and salvation, or at least
  upon no other terms, then such as have not the priviledge to be admitted to it
  yet at all; if the promise to believers and their children run only thus,
  <hi>viz:</hi> you shall stand under the title of the holy people of God, under
  rightto outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, when others shall not, not only you, but also your
  children shall be <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and inchurched,</hi> but neither you nor they
  ever the sooner saved, as born of you, further then together with you they
  shall believe and obey me in all things, in which case of faith and obedience
  all unbelievers in the world, and their children shall be saved, as soon as
  either you or they, it is as much as to say, the promise of a liberty and
  freedome to partake of the ordinance, is to you and your children above others,
  but the promise to partake of the inheritance is as much to all others 
  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:42067:53"/> and their children as to you, and yours; what most
  <hi>comfortless comfort</hi> is this, to men cast down under sense of sin, and
  guilt? what a pittious pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ster is
  here applied to men wounded in conscience, and smarting under the direfull
  apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Gods wrath? besides what exquisite non-sense do you make the
  Apostle speak, if his words be taken in your sense, for they must run thus,
  <hi>viz.</hi> first, <hi>by way of precept,</hi> repent and <hi>be
  baptized</hi> you and your children, in the name of Christ for remission of
  sinnes, and then <hi>by way of incouragement</hi> thus, <hi>viz.</hi> so this
  great priviledge of being <hi>baptized</hi> shall belong to you and your seed,
  which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent <hi>unbaptized</hi> ones, and their seed shall not enjoy, but
  the promise of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and remission of sins is made no more to you then
  unto them: this is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store them from their contrite and weather beaten
  condition, and to invest them <hi>cum privilegio</hi> with a witness, yet this
  is all the priviledge, if the promise here made to these parents, and their
  children be of no more then being <hi>outwardly incovenanted, i.e. inchurched
  by baptism</hi> (as you say it is.) But undoubtedly it must be otherwise then
  thus for all your saying and the promise, take it which of these two waies you
  will, <hi>viz.</hi> for the meer <hi>tender</hi> or <hi>profer</hi> of the
  thing (as the word promise is sometimes used) or for the thing it self profered
  or promised (in which last sense its mostly taken) it must needs be of some

                  </gap>ract from all true and immediate title to remission of
  sinnes and salvation: yea verily its most evident that the thing here promised
  is no less then remission of sinnes and salvation itself, for as no less is
  exprest in the very text wherein he names <hi>remission of sinnes and the holy
  spirit,</hi> which elswhere is called the earnest of the inheritance, so unless
  you will divide the children from sharing alike with their parents in that
  promise which in the self same sentence, terms and sense is propounded alike to
  them both, so as to say the word promise is to be understood of remission of
  sinnes, and salvation as in relation to the parents, but of an inferior thing
  <hi>viz.</hi> a right to ordinances onely as in relation to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants which

  were <hi>baptized</hi> at that time, he <hi>concludes</hi> them under such a

  3000, if all the infants of all those had been dipped also.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, nor were there any more inchurched that day among the

               <p>Fiftly, It crosseth the current of all other Scripture to put

  I grant, but that the new covenant, or Gospel promise is made to any mans

  of it, before they are called to profess faith in Christ) is a thing, which I
  confess I found in the common high way, when I look'd not after it, but since I

  the name of <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed in the sence of the Gospel; first mark how
  he magnifies them exceedingly, and sets forth their dignity and preheminence
  above all other people, under the name of <hi>Israelites,</hi> as <hi>to whom
  pertained the adoption, and the glory, and the Covenants; i. e.</hi> both
  Testaments the type and the antitype, unto whom then pertained not only the
  giving of the law, but also the promises (for verily the several excellencies
  of both law and Gospel, upon the several terms upon which both were
  established, did in more special sence belong unto that people at that time,
  then to any people under the Sun, yea the first co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the promise

  men, in one respect it did principally pertain to them above all others, till
  they lost their preheminence, <hi>viz.</hi> not in respect of any right to it
  they had by birth whether they received it, yea or no, but in respect of the
  <hi>first tender</hi> therof, which, when it came in fuller force to be

  eternal life, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he must <hi>patrizare</hi> to all their natural
  posterity too, and be the spiritual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not of their persons onely, but of
  their off-spring also: But Sirs, let me tell you he is not so much as a father
  to his own seed in the Gospel sense, neither can they stand his children; or
  the children of God, and heirs of the heavenly bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and kindome, because
  they come out of his loines, unless they do as he did, for though his fleshly
  seed as a type for the time then being, stood denominated the children of God,
  and holy in an outward sense, and heirs according to the earthly promise, yet
  that account is gone now, and there's no other way whereby the <hi>Iews</hi>
  themselves, much less any generations among the Gentiles, can be stiled the
  chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> so as to expect the gospel
  portion, but believing in <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> in their own persons, <hi>Gal.
  3. 26. 29. Ye are all the children of God by faith in Iesus Christ: if ye be
  Christs then are ye</hi> Abrahams <hi>seed, and heirs according to the
  promise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another place which cleers it that <hi>Abrahams</hi> own seed in
  the old Covenants account are not his own in the account of the gospel, so as
  barely thereupon to stand in any title to either the priviledges or ordinances
  thereof, or to fellowship now in his family, is <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. where Christ
  being cavill'd at by the <hi>Iews</hi> for promising them the priviledge of the
  Gospel-freedom from sin,, to which they were slaves, servants and bondmen (for
  all that legal freedom they did so boast of) upon faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in his
  words, discovers so plainly that a man may run and read it, the discarding of
  the Jews from all these three things which I am now proving, that for want of
  faith, they are perished from them since the gospel.</p>
               <p>First, from the repute and denomination of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
  children any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Secondly, from any share in the glorious, or spirituall blessing
  of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from any right of abiding longer in the Church, which
  they were the children of before, which Church <hi>(as visible)</hi> now as
  well as then, and to the end of the world, since Gods conferring the
  <hi>fatherhood</hi> of the faithful upon him, is called the house or family of
  <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, they say in a snuff two or three times ore, that they
  <hi>are Abrahams seed</hi> v. 33. that <hi>Abraham</hi> is their
  <hi>father</hi> v. 39. that they are not born of fornication (meaning as
  <hi>Ishm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>el</hi> the Son of the
  <hi>bond-woman,</hi> or servant to their mother <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
  they had one father, even <hi>God</hi> v. 41. to which Christ replies, not by
  denial of any of all this, for 'twas true every tittle in that sense, in which
  they meant it, <hi>i. e.</hi> the typical sense and meaning of the old
  Covenant, yea they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, and this Christ confesses
  in plain terms verse 37. <hi>I know you are Abrahams seed;</hi> yea they were
  also the children of God by an outward and typicall adoption of them unto
  himself, as his peculiar ones, and heirs of that typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inheritance,
  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8. &amp;c. but by telling them that <hi>Abrahams</hi>
  children are accounted of otherwise now then formerly, <hi>viz.</hi> not as
  comming out of his loines, but as doing his works, as being like him, and
  allied to him, not so much after the flesh as after the faith: whereupon they
  not yet believing, he denies them to be, and goes about to prove them not to be
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> children in the true and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial sense, in this
  <hi>Hypothesis</hi> verse 39. <hi>if ye were Abrahams children, ye would do the
  works of Abraham,</hi> to which do but add the minor, <hi>viz. but ye do not
  the works of Abraham,</hi> and the conclusion follows thus, <hi>viz. therefore
  ye are not the children of Abraham:</hi> you see Christ asserts them to be
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> children in the old account, so as to stand members of the
  old house, but denieth them to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> children in the sense of
  the new.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they say they are free men, and were never in bondage
  to any man, <pb n="98" facs="tcp:42067:56"/> to which <hi>Christ</hi> replies by granting
  it was so indeed, in the outward typical sense that they were free men, and
  true heirs of that earthly glory, that was promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Abraham</hi> in
  that old <hi>Canaan,</hi> but denies them to be freemen as to the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
  with that heavenly fredom of the <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which is above the mother
  of all true believers <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. yea in those spiritual respects, in
  which the Son makes free indeed those that know and receive the truth and
  gospel, they were but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants verse 34. and in bondage to sin, which is the
  greatest slavery of all, as also <hi>Paul</hi> sayes <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 25. that
  <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was, which was of old, and was in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage with her
  children, so he saies for all their <hi>Sonship,</hi> yet in truth they are but
  <hi>servants</hi> and not <hi>sonnes,</hi> he grants their <hi>Sonship,</hi>
  freedom, and title to the old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, but denies their son and
  <hi>heirship</hi> as to the new.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they boast and bless themselves in their standing in
  the house or fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Abraham, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> as to the
  ordinances, rights and priviledges whereof who but themselves had the title?
  for this indeed was their advantage of old, that to them were committed all the
  <hi>oracles of God,</hi> to which Christ replies, true they did stand in the
  house for a time, yet but for a time, and though sons and heirs in the laws
  <hi>typical</hi> sense, yet they were were but servants in the Gospels, because
  they believe not in him, and being but servants (as <hi>Moses</hi> and all his
  house or church the old <hi>Israel</hi> were, in comparison of Christ the Son,
  and his house or Church, <hi>i. e,</hi> the Saints) they must anon be packing
  out of the house, and abide in the Church <hi>i. e. Abrahams</hi> family no
  longer, that the true Sons and heirs may come in, <hi>i. e.</hi> believers, who
  are the blessed seed to whom onely the Gospel-promises and priviledges do
  belong, <hi>ver. 35. And the servant</hi> (saith he) <hi>abideth not in the
  house for ever, but the son abideth ever, if therefore the son make you
  free,</hi> and that he doth not for all your former freedome, unless you
  believe in him, and continue in his words, <hi>then shall ye be free
  indeed,</hi> even to the glory, oracles and blessings of the spiritual house
  the Gospel-church, which else you must be cut off from for ever: thus Christ
  tells them, and so indeed it came to passe within a while, for not believing
  and repenting, which are the only terms
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>at give right and admittance to
  the ordinances and fellowship of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, these Iews though natural
  branches of <hi>Abraham</hi> still as much as ever, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleshly seed
  of a believer could have steaded them at all, as to a standing here, were yet
  clean broken off from the Root <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he stands a Root to all the
  faithful, because onely of unbelief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. when such as were
  wild olives, and no kin at all to <hi>Abraham</hi> after the flesh, were in
  their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but not their natural seed with them (save as they believed
  with them) own'd as his children by believing, and as members of the true
  Church under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And this was also most directly declared by <hi>Iohn
  the Baptist,</hi> and the rest of the first ministers of the Gospel, who would
  not admit of the Jews as Jews, though <hi>Abrahams</hi> own seed, and holy by
  birth, and members thereupon of that Church under the law to baptism, and
  membership in the Gospel-church, when they offered themselves upon the
  aforenamed terms, without faith, repentance, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for howbeit the
  Pharisees and Saduces and the whole multitude of people came forth to be
  baptized of <hi>Iohn, Mat,</hi> 3. 7. &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 7. &amp;c.
  pretending and pleading that if baptism were a Church-priviledge, it must needs
  belong to them, as who were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet see how he
  rounds them up as having no part nor portion in that matter: <hi>O generation
  of vipers</hi> (saith he) <hi>who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to
  come?</hi> as if he had said, what have you to do with that remission of
  sinnes, righteousness and redemption from wrath to come, which I preach and
  baptize in token of, being though invested with circumcision, Church-membership
  and other legal rites and priviledges, yet corrupt and crooked in
  conversations? <hi>bring forth therefore, i. e.</hi> to the end that you may be
  admitted, baptized, and inc hurched here, <hi>fruits answerable to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
  of life, and begin not,</hi> (its like that plea was in their thoughts and
  mouths too, <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42067:56"/> whereupon he puts them off from it) <hi>think
  not to say that we have Abraham to our father,</hi> we are the seed of such an
  eminent believer, <hi>for God is able of these stones to raise up children to
  Abraham, i. e.</hi> God will, without being behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to you, raise a seed to
  <hi>Abraham,</hi> rather then want them, from among these stones, which whether
  he meanes stones litterally, or the Gentiles which were yet as stocks and
  stones in their eies, I leave you further to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, but thus much we may
  gather hence however, that even in that very time wherein the birth-priviledge
  and holiness of a fleshly seed stood in full force and power unrepealed (as
  then it did) so far as to give right to all ordinances of the law, yet, even
  then I say before, how much more since the <hi>Abrogation</hi> thereof by
  faith, <hi>Abrahams</hi> own seed could not, much less then may the seed of
  believing Gentiles, now its repealed, (as such) be admitted to baptism without
  repentance: the Jews as impenitent and unbelieving as they were, stood uncast
  out of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Church, while that Jewish Church it self was yet standing,
  but they could not passe <hi>per saltum</hi> out of that Church into the Gospel
  Church, nor immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their right to circumcision, which meer fleshly
  birth gave them, prove their right, without somewhat more, to baptism; yet thus
  they might have done, if what gave right of old to one of these ordinances,
  doth in like manner inright persons to the other,</p>
               <p>And this that <hi>Abrahams</hi> own naturall seed do not now
  stand his seed, so as thereupon onely, or at all to stand in this house of
  <hi>Abraham,</hi> i. e. the visible Church of the Gospel, and in title to the
  promises and priviledges thereof, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and more lively figured out to
  our undestandings in that admirable allusion of <hi>Paul</hi> to the things
  transacted of old, as a type hereof in the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> between
  the two mothers and their children, <hi>viz. Hagar and Sarah, Ishmael and
  Isaac, Gal.</hi> 4. 21. to the end, where (to give you but a hint of the thing,
  that you may follow it in your own thoughts at leasure) having first related
  what is written of <hi>Abrahams</hi> having two sonnes, one by his bond-maid
  <hi>Hagar,</hi> viz. <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> that was born after the flesh, the
  other by the free woman, or his true wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> viz. <hi>Isaac,</hi>
  who though born of <hi>Abrahams</hi> flesh as well as the other, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
  he was promised to come of <hi>Abrahams</hi> true spouse <hi>Sarah,</hi> long
  before he did, was said to be born by promise, he asserts these things to be an
  Allegory, <hi>i. e.</hi> things which though really and truly done, yet were
  done also in a figure, and as a shadow of some other things to come
  <hi>viz.</hi> the two Covenants and two seeds of <hi>Abraham</hi> thereunto
  belonging, or the two several Jerusalems or Churches of the law and the Gospel,
  with their several children <hi>viz.</hi> the fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>
  and the spiritual, each answering respectively, not only as anti-types to their
  several types, that pointnd at them, whether the maid and her son, or the
  mistriss and hers, but also <hi>inter se invicem,</hi> as the two mothers and
  their children did, each of them unto the other, for these (saith he) i. e.
  these two mothers and children, the bondwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and her son, and the freewoman
  and her son, are the two Covenants or testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, meaning in signification, or
  in way of resemblance of them, the one from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> the other
  from mount <hi>Sion,</hi> both spoken of, and to the life also poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out one

  <hi>Moses,</hi> that gendreth to bondage, or enthrawles her children, this is

  self over the other for a time, as if she were the onely mistriss, whose seed
  must inherit all, yet in comparison of the true mother, and her seed,
  <hi>viz.</hi> the gospel <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> which was yet to come, was but in
  bondage with her children, and must when <pb n="100" facs="tcp:42067:57"/> that seed once
  should come in, be chashiered and cast quite and clean out of doors as a seed
  to be no more accounted on, so far as to abide with the other: for
  ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless; <hi>i, e.</hi> all her present liberty, and immunity
  notwithstanding, <hi>what saith the Scripture?</hi> (saies he) <hi>cast out the
  bond woman and her son, for the son of the bond woman shall not be heir with

  <hi>Earthly Ierusalem, viz.</hi> the natural seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> shall
  not share in priviledges, nor the inheritance promised in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel together
  with the spiritual seed, <hi>viz.</hi> the believers or children of the Church

               <p>Thus as <hi>Hagar,</hi> and her son <hi>Ishmael,</hi> that stood
  in <hi>Abrahams</hi> house a while, and were proud and insolent, as if they
  should have dwelt there for ever, were at last packt out before <hi>Isaac</hi>
  the true son and heir by promise of the old inheritance, and ordinance, when he
  was born, and before <hi>Sarah,</hi> who would not indure to have
  <hi>Ishmael</hi> have any portion in <hi>Canaan,</hi> or any room in the house
  with her son <hi>Isaac,</hi> so also <hi>Sarah</hi> her self, and her son
  <hi>Isaac,</hi> I mean the fleshly <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and Jew that dwelt as
  Mistris, and heir for a time in the house, inheriting only some outward
  excellencies, and enjoyments, were at last, being found moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereat, cast
  out of the house, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Church, the Son-ship, the glory, and all
  before the true Mother and her children, <hi>viz,</hi> the Gospel Church or
  true <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi> and the true <hi>Isaac, Christ</hi> and his
  <hi>Saints,</hi> or seed of Believers, who will not bear not brook it to have a
  meer fleshly seed, though of <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, much less of any Gentile
  believers, to dwell with them in the family: <hi>Isaac</hi> and the fleshly
  <hi>Israelites</hi> were by promise to inherit the old Testament priviledges,
  and the <hi>Ishmaelites</hi> were not suffered (as such) to partake with them
  therein; <hi>Christ</hi> and believers are by promise to receive the eternal
  inheritance, nor is any mans fleshly posterity, no not <hi>Abrahams</hi> own by
  <hi>Isaac,</hi> I mean the <hi>Israelites</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (as such) permitted
  or promised to participate therein: <hi>Ishmael</hi> though as
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed after the flesh he had a portion, yet had nothing to do
  with that of <hi>Isaac</hi> the child of promise in the type; <hi>Isaac</hi>
  though <hi>Abrahams</hi> son, not only after the flesh, but by promise too (as
  in reference to <hi>Ishmael)</hi> and so in true title to a better portion then
  <hi>Ishmaels, viz. the Earthly Canaan,</hi> and that as a type for a time, yet
  being but his fleshly seed in comparison to <hi>Christ,</hi> and believers, and
  by his bare fleshly birth (save only that he was a spirituall child also by
  believing) as inferior to them, as <hi>Ishmael</hi> was to himself, hath nought
  at all to do (as the fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham)</hi> with that heavenly
  portion that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to these.</p>
               <p>Now then if it be so (and so it will appear to him that doth not
  trifle, but truely understand the Scriptures, and this last especially which
  with many more <hi>viz, Heb. 8. Heb.</hi> 9. speak expresly of two distinct
  covenants or Testaments, made with two sorts of seeds of <hi>Abraham</hi>
  concerning two <hi>Canaans, viz.</hi> an <hi>Earthly</hi> and a
  <hi>Heavenly,</hi> whereof one all along was a type of the other, for a time
  only, and now ended, contrary to all our <hi>blind Seers,</hi> that confound,
  and blindly blend both of them into one) if so I say that <hi>Abrahams</hi> own
  sons by bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily birth are not now his own in Gospel account, nor heirs (as so
  born only) of the Gospel promise and inheritance, nor house dwellers in the
  Gospel Church, for want of personal faith, though <hi>Abrahams</hi> children
  after the flesh still as much as ever, then I cannot but stand amazed at the
  perverseness of you the <hi>Priesthood</hi> in three things.</p>
               <p>First in that meerly because you and your people do believe (and
  I would to God you did believe, for so but few, for all your flourish of either
  you or your people do indeed) therefore you count your natural seed the seed of
  <hi>Abraham,</hi> this you express in plain terms in your <hi>Review</hi> p.
  14.</p>
               <p>Secondly in that, even <hi>Eâtenùs,</hi> as your
  children only, you hold them heirs of the promise of the Gospel covenant made
  with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:42067:57"/> Thirdly in that you sign them as visibly
  such by <hi>Baptism</hi> (as you call it) and thereby admit them into
  membership <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  (as you call it) and having yet no evidence of their belief, conclude them
  under a true title to all outward ordinances, save such as upon your own heads
  only you keep from them, if by the word they have such title to
  Church-fellowship, as you say they have, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Supper,</hi> of

  in baptism.</p>
               <p>Sirs, let me reason with you a little, and begg some cool
  consideration, and ingenuous answer from you concerning these particulars.</p>
               <p>First <hi>which way come your natural seed, you being but
  Gentiles in the flesh, to be the seed of</hi> Abraham?</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>why do you, or how can you sign them as heirs of
  the Gospel promise so simply upon that account only? there are but two seeds
  of</hi> Abraham <hi>that I know of in all the world,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>His seed after the flesh, and such are all those
  that are born of his body,</hi> viz. Ishmael, <hi>and his Children by</hi>
  Keturah, <hi>to whom he gave portions, and those that came of him by</hi> Isaac
  <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>which only (for</hi> Esau <hi>sold his birth-right)
  were heirs with him of the Land of</hi> Canaan.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>His seed after the faith, and such are those only
  that walk in his steps</hi> Rom. 4. 12. <hi>that do his works</hi> John 8.
  <hi>Who are also by that same faith which denominates them his children, said
  to be</hi> Christs <hi>also, and the children of God, and heirs with him of the
  world according to the Gospell Promise,</hi> Rom. 4. 12, 13. Gal. 3. 16. 1 Cor.
  3. 21. 22. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non datur tertium semen Abrahae:</hi> two seeds of
  <hi>Abraham</hi> the Scripture mentions, but a third fort cannot be assigned,
  all and only those that descend from his loines as the <hi>Midianites and
  others by Keturah,</hi> the <hi>Ishmailites</hi> by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> the
  <hi>Edomites</hi> and <hi>Israelites</hi> by <hi>Sarah,</hi> which last only
  were the holy seed, and children of promise in reference to the
  <hi>Hagarens</hi> in a type and sole heirs of the typical <hi>Canaan,</hi> all
  these I say were the first sort, all believers, of what nation soever, are the
  second sort, but the natural seed of believers are neither of the one nor of
  the other.</p>
               <p>As for the children of the <hi>Proselites, i. e. Iews</hi> not
  by birth, but profession, which by way of exception against this may possibly
  pop into some of your minds, I utterly deny them (as so born) to be any seed of

  abominably besides them both (as the Priest-hood doth, baptizing (as not at all
  but rantizing so) not at all after the manner of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, viz. not males
  only, not on the eighth day only, but any other, when they may as well upon
  that, not servants also upon the Masters, faith as well as the Children upon

  might<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then eat the Passeover) I avouch them to be not a little besides
  their natural, but much more besides their spiritual intellectualls.</p>
               <p>Let this then satisfy as to any conceit, that any may have, as
  that the <hi>Prosolites</hi> seed were the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
  heirs with him because circumcised, viz. that though all <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed
  that were heirs with him were circumcised, yet all that were circumcised were
  not thereby proved to be <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, nor heirs with him of either
  promise, and though his fleshly seed, <hi>Israel</hi> the heir especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and
  his spirituall seed also, <hi>i. e.</hi> believing Jewes, and
  <hi>Proselites</hi> were both thereupon to come under that dispensation, and
  that as heirs too severally of the two severall promises, <hi>viz.</hi> the
  <hi>typifying,</hi> and <hi>typified Canaan,</hi> yet many past under
  circumcision upon that forenamed account only, of being males in the house,
  that were neither <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed after the slesh nor after the faith,
  as Servants, and the seed of <hi>Proselite Masters, Fathers,</hi> not appearing
  yet to believe with them; for even such were to be circumcised under the law,
  though (by your leave) not such to be by the like reason baptized under the
  Gospell, for as there is no command for such a matter, so if there had, the
  Servants of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> (himself only turning <hi>Christian)</hi> must
  have been (as tis known they were not) baptized together with him: besides if
  baptism must be like to circumcision in its subject, then not only he that is
  not yet apparently an heir, but he also that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently not an heir by
  faith must be baptized, aswell as <hi>Abrahams</hi> sonne <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and
  his servant <hi>Eleazer,</hi> and all the other males of his house were
  cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, who were all well enough known to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be none of
  the heirs of that land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whereof circumcision was given to
  him, and his seed in <hi>Isaac,</hi> in token of their inheriting of it, at
  that very time when he circumcised them.</p>
               <p>I demand therefore yet once again, what seed of <hi>Abraham</hi>
  your infants are, in that thereupon you undertake (as so) to baptize them? you
  tell us in your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,</hi> pag. 14. <hi>They are</hi> Semen fidei,
  <hi>the children of his faith, his spiritual seed;</hi> I am ashamed to hear
  you say so, which way do they come to be, in that minority, his spiritual seed,

  themselves, for <hi>so Zachaeus,</hi> say you, <hi>by believing was made the

  the spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by believing, which word

  the believing parents and their children, and yet though exhibited to them both
  alike in one and the self same phrase and form of speech (for saith
  <hi>Peter</hi> the promise is to you and your children, and to them that are
  farre off yea even as many (meaning of you and your children and of them that
  are far off) as the Lord shall call) do they belong upon such various and
  different grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> to the parents upon their own faith, to the
  children upon the parents faith? my father then it seems, what ere his fathers
  were, must prove his pedegree from <hi>Abraham</hi> by his doing as

  repentance, for whom you can make no higher pretence then this, <hi>viz.</hi>
  they are the children of believers? me thinks if meer birth-priviledges and
  fleshly descent, must carry it still without faith in the seed themselves, are
  not the Iews infants to this day higher born then any Gentiles infants in the
  world, whose parents are believers? for they verily can say no less then this,
  we are the natural issue of the father of all the faithfull, yet may they not
  be own'd barely upon that account to gospel-ordinances, and if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

               <p>Then learn once I beseech you this lessen from your selves,
  which you will not learn from <hi>Iohn, Christ</hi> and <hi>Paul, viz.</hi>
  that the ground of standing <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, sons and heirs;
  and Church-members under the Gospel is not the the faith and faederation of the
  parents, by vertue of which you plead your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens right to baptism, saying
  they have believers, as the Jews once to <hi>Iohn</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theirs, saying,
  we have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our father, but faith it self in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
  persons so standing, for so many Jews, heathens, infidels children as are of
  the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> i. e. not born of faithful parents, but faithful
  themseves (as he was) are incorporated; incovenanted, inchurched as
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelically blessed with faithful
  <hi>Abraham;</hi> but till even believers children, yea <hi>Abrahams</hi> own
  believe themselves, the parents faith cannot now possibly ingraft them, the
  time of faith or standing by faith alone in the house, or visible Church of God
  being now come in, the standing by any fleshly generation what soever is done
  away, yea <hi>Abrahams</hi> own children, the naturall branches that grow out
  of his loynes are cut off from standing (as till Chirist they did) now any
  longer upon their own Root <hi>Abraham,</hi> because of unbelief.</p>
               <p>I say then that no infant in infancy, of what believing parent
  soever, is either <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, or dying in infancy is
  saved upon any such account as a believers seed, or <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, nor
  whilst living an infant onely, may be signed by baptism as an heir apparent of
  salvation: for if <hi>Abraham</hi> stand not a spiritual father to his own meer
  fleshly seed, he stands not so sure to the meer flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seed of any believing
  Gentile, for that were to priviledge every ordinary belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his
  natural seed above either himself or his own.</p>
               <p>Nor doth this hinder, or deny the salvation of the dying infants
  of believers, or dispose them ere the sooner (muchless necessarily) to
  damnation, to say they are not <hi>Abrahams</hi> spirituall seed <hi>(quâ
  believers infants)</hi> nor heirs to salvation <pb n="105" facs="tcp:42067:59"/> upon any
  such account as that, for though neither upon that, nor any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at
  all they may warrantably be baptized, yet its more then possible, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
  either (because infallible) that there's other Scripture account enough, upon
  which when we see them die in infancy we may assert them undoubtedly not to be
  damned; for as it is most sure and true, that all that are apparently (if
  really) <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> spiritual seed by faith must so living, so dying be
  saved, in token and farther evidence of which to themselves more then others
  they are by the good wil of Christ to be baptized, yet is it neither true, nor
  necessary that all that are saved must be <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed by
  faith, but most certain that some shall be saved, that never were
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed in any sense at all, witnesse not onely the faithful
  fore-fathers of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for he was their seed, and not they his, but
  also all dying infants of what parents soever both before <hi>Abrahams</hi>
  time, and since, of whom to salvation notwithstanding those are the onely
  termes on which it belongs to adult ones, to whom its preacht, <hi>Mark</hi>
  16. 15, 16. these being truly capable of neither, 'tis not required that they
  should either repent, believe or be baptized. I know this Iustification of
  dying infants without faith is uncouth, and little less, for all it holds forth
  so much salvation, then damnable doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you Divines, that plead the
  contrary, but I shall by the help of God make it good to the faces of you all,
  when I come to consider the baldness of your conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in this point, as you
  give me good occasion to do in some places, where me thinks you meddle with it
  somewhat clumsily, as it were in mittins, as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there's no other way
  revealed for the salvation of such by Christ, to whom the gospel is preached,
  who are capable to hear, and do what's required, for such onely the word
  universally speaks of, when it speaks of salvation in that way, but the way of
  belief and actuall obedience onely, therefore there's no other way for the
  salvation of dying infants by Christ, who can possibly neither believe in him,
  nor obey him, which as it is such shameful stuff, that I cannot bear it with
  out inward blushing at your blindness, so whether you have not as much cause to
  be ashamed on't within your selves is well worth your inmost inquiry.</p>
               <p>I say therefore again, so far is this from excluding dying
  infants of believers from entrance into the kingdome of heaven, to say they are
  neither <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed by faith, nor heirs thereof upon that
  ground onely of being so, that it rather concludes and supposes there's some
  other ground that is common with them to the innocent infants of even infidels,
  and all the world, upon which these, whom, though they are hundreds to one, yet
  your selves in your fierce wrath, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less cruelty devote universally to
  damnation, may dying in infancy universally be saved also; which ground if you
  will yet know it, is the righteousness of Christ, the free imputation of which
  universally from the father saves not onely all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve from both that,
  and their actuall transgressions too, but even the whole world, whether they
  believe it or no from the the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; so
  that none at all ever perish upon that account, in which respect he is said to
  be <hi>the Saviour of all men, but especially of them that believe:</hi> much

               <p>No such matter <hi>Sirs,</hi> there's either no good Antecedent
  or else no good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence in this: for first, if you mean as to the Gospel,
  Church and Covenant, the children of the unbelieving Jews are not so broken
  off, and excluded with their parents, in such a sence as you imagine, i. e.
  upon the Account of their parents unbelief onely, but for want of faith in
  their own persons, and as succeeding their fathers in unbelief, for if any
  children of the unbelieving Jews, when they come to years (and children when at
  years are the naturall seed of their parents, I hope as well as in infancy it
  self, if being the children of such or such parents alone would either ingraft
  or exclude) if I say unbelieving Iews children do believe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is so
  made to them, that their parents unbelief cannot exclude them, but if the
  children at years do not believe, the promise is so little made to believers,
  and their seed as that the parents belief availes no further then to the
  engrafting of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and hecannot at all entitle all his natural seed by his
  single faith, nor as heirs of the same heavenly inheritance with him, inright
  them to the ordinance in token of it: but if you mean as to the old Church and
  Covenant then</p>
               <p>Secondly, it follows no more then if you should go about to make
  a way for the needle by the thred, that because the Iews and their seed under
  the law were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, and thrown out of Covenant altogether, so the Gentiles
  under the Gospel and their seed must be owned, and disowned thus collectively,
  for as to that old Covenant of the law, made with the fleshly Israel concerning
  the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> the very promise of that was made to the whole
  body of that nation and people, that came of <hi>Abraham Isaac and Iacobs</hi>
  loins, in such a manner as that their infants were by very naturall descent
  according to the promise, as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y
  and fully heirs of it as themselves, from which consequetnly, when once God
  took his advantage, by the breach first made on their part, to break it on his
  part also, he must necessarily turn them all out together, and so he did,
  discovenanting the whole nation at once, and as it is said in <hi>Zach.</hi>
  11. 10. breaking the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which he had made with all the people,
  discarding and disinheriting them from all that glory in the lump; but the
  Gospel. Covenant, and promise concerning the heavenly inheritance is not at all
  on this wise, but of a different nature, taking <pb n="111" facs="tcp:42067:62"/> in no
  whole nation in the world, nor any one or more mens meer natural seed, no not
  <hi>Abrahams, Isaacs, and Iacobs</hi> (as the other did) to all generations of
  its continuance, but rather <hi>Sigillatim)</hi> such several persons out of
  every nation, tongue, kindred and people that fear God, and work righteousness
  <hi>Rev. 5. 9. Act.</hi> 10. 34, 35. even all, and onely such as obey him:
  <hi>Singulos generum credentes,</hi> not <hi>genera singulorum credentium, vel
  non.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If therefore you speak of the Jews standing upon the <hi>Root
  Abraham,</hi> and in the Church before <hi>Christ,</hi> upon the old Covenant
  account, then I confess that the whole body of them were broken off altogether,
  and that as they, and their fleshly seed were all incovenanted, so they were
  all discovenanted at once, when that covenant of circumcision, which God gave
  to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his fleshly seed <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. concerning the land
  of <hi>Canaan</hi> was it self abolished in Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; but then the
  consequence will not hold from that covenant to this of the Gospel; these being
  two distinct and different covenants, the terms of standing in which are in no
  wise the same. But if you speak of the covenant of the Gospel, then your
  <hi>Antecedent</hi> is false, for I deny utterly that the Jews and their seed
  were altogether alienated from that, further then every individual of them did
  cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves off from a right of standing therein by want of faith in their
  own persons, for as this covenant was never made with any men, and their meer
  fleshly seed, no not with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and their
  natural posterity, so that a bare birth of their bodies doth <hi>ipso
  facto</hi> make them heirs of the heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance promised therein; nor
  give them a right (as such only) to be signed as true heirs thereof, but only
  with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his spiritual seed, <hi>i. e. Christ</hi> and all
  believers in him; so no men and all their naturall posterity are outed from it
  together, but as both they, and their posterity do stand together in unbelief
  upon which account faith being the only way of standing heirs under the Gospel,
  and the <hi>Iews Children</hi> proving unbelievers in all ages as well as their
  parents, I confess they are broken off together, and not otherwise, for if the
  Children of the <hi>Iews</hi> did appear to have faith (as in infancy they
  cannot, and when they are grown up unversally they do not) their parents
  infidelity could in no wise prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit their standing; and since neither in
  infancy, nor at age they appear to be in the faith, their parents in case they
  were never so faithful can in no wise intitle them to a standing, for then the
  natural seed of those thousands of <hi>Iews</hi> which did believe in the
  Primitive times, have a <hi>birth-priviledge,</hi> and holiness to this day,
  whereupon they may claim admittannce unto baptism, as well as any, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
  if those words <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. if the <hi>Root</hi> be holy so are the
  branches, were to be taken in such a sense as you put upon them, but we know
  that though they are branches growing naturally upon that <hi>holy Root</hi> as
  you call it, of believing parents, yet they are counted unholy by your selves,
  because they believe not in their own persons, yea if we should ask how the
  children of those <hi>Iews,</hi> that at first believed, did come to be such
  strangers to the Gospel Church, your selves would answer vs because they
  believed not, as their parents did, by which you do no less than grant what we
  contend for, <hi>viz.</hi> that the faith of <hi>Ancestors</hi> gives no right
  to their posterity to stand at all in the Gospel Church, and Covenant, but
  faith in the particular persons only so standing.</p>
               <p>Well then they were broken off: but why? not because they had
  not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parents, for <hi>Abraham</hi> was the fleshly Father of all of
  them, and the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive believing <hi>Iews</hi> were the fleshly fathers of
  many of them, and are to this day as much as ever, if bare birth priviledge
  could ingraft them as it did of old in the family of the <hi>Iewish
  Church:</hi> Nor was it because they wanted title upon which they might have
  stood still in the <hi>Iewish Church,</hi> if that <hi>Church</hi> it self had
  stood to this day, for they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, and that gave them
  capacity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to dwell in the house before, their own unbelief
  notwithstanding; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <pb n="112" facs="tcp:42067:63"/> they do not believe
  themselves, because the terms of standing in the <hi>Church</hi> which before
  <hi>Christ</hi> were these, <hi>viz. We have Abraham to our Father,</hi> we are
  the Children of such, and such parents, are now quite changed, so that it boots
  not to say such a thing as <hi>Abraham</hi> is our father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.
  unless we can also say we repent, and believe the Gospel.</p>
               <p>The Jews were broken off by unbelief, and thou and thine <hi>(o
  believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile)</hi> must stand by faith, yet not thine by thy faith, but
  thou thy self by thine, and they by their own; faith is that in which thou
  standing, and not thy seed, thou hast right to stand in the Church, and not
  they, in which they standing, and not thy self, they have right to stand in the
  <hi>Church,</hi> and thou hast none. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity</hi> in <hi>personall</hi>
  faith gives <hi>perpetual personal</hi> right to <hi>baptism,</hi> and to
  <hi>Church-membership,</hi> but not a perpetuity of the same right to any mans
  whole <hi>posterity;</hi> there's now no difference made at all as to Gospel
  interest, by being either this or that by nature, but in all the world any
  person Jew or Gentile, male or Female seed of believer or of unbeliever,
  <hi>Barbarian, Scythian,</hi> bond or free, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to be saved, and
  signed as an heir of salvation by <hi>baptism</hi> upon personal faith, but in
  no wise the <hi>progeny</hi> upon the faith of the <hi>parentage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet to put it more out of doubt, that the Covenant holiness,
  and church-right of mens fleshly seed, which was of old, is not continuing
  under the Gospel, but <hi>Ceremonial</hi> and so ended in <hi>Christ,</hi> in
  whom your selves say <hi>Iudicialia sunt Mortua, Ceremonialia Mortifera,</hi> I
  will leave two or three consequences upon the file, which either answer and
  that not <hi>invitâ Minervâ,</hi> nor stretching your
  <hi>Genius</hi> beyond sense and reason, rather than want somewhat whereby to
  prove your <hi>Iudaizing</hi> to be <hi>judicious,</hi> or else by silence say
  you cannot: I leave you to consult with them as you see occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That holiness which sanctified the Iewes Land, City, Temple,

               </p>

  also, for even these were sanctifyed and holy <hi>Denominativè,</hi> and

  willing to go along with you, and therefore will lend you my hand so farr as to
  sling one stone after all that <hi>Canaanitish</hi> holiness, wherewith the

  not only all the <hi>babes</hi> born in <hi>Christendome,</hi> but also the

  sanctuaries, with the name of <hi>HOLINES to the Lord,</hi> as far as tis
  possible to keep it out from creeping into <hi>England</hi> any more, and that
  shall be an Argument from the meer <hi>typicallness</hi> of all that
  <hi>Dedicative</hi> holiness, that was once resident in the <hi>Iewish
  Church,</hi> and every thing almost that pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto, the like to
  which D<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Featley</hi> feigns
  to be now in the <hi>Christian</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and thus I frame it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All that holiness, which was but typical, was but temporal
  or ceremoniall and so to be abolished under the Gospel.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But all that holiness whereby the Iewes land, City, Temple,
  Altar, Priest-hood, people, first fruits, profits, and all the appertenances of
  that first Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, were denominated holy, was but meerly typicall, and
  figurative of a future holiness, that was to come in more fully under the new
  Covenant, second tabernacle or Church under the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo, all that holyness, wherewith the Iewes land, City,
  Temple, &amp;i. was holy, was but temporal, or ceremonial, and so to be
  abolished under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first <hi>Proposition</hi> needs no proof, for your selves
  deny not but that all things under the law that were but <hi>types</hi> of
  things to come, were terminated and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken clean away, when the truth, or
  things typified thereby did come in under <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is no less cleer then the other, for the Law
  had but the <hi>shadow</hi> of <pb n="114" facs="tcp:42067:64"/> things to come, not the
  very Image of the things <hi>Heb,</hi> 10. 1. it had but the <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns</hi>
  of <hi>holy things</hi> in the heavens, not the holy or heavenly things
  themselves, those holy places made with hands, and all the holy furniture
  thereunto pertaining, were but figures of the true holy place, i. e. heaven it
  self, into which our high-priest is gone, there to appear in the presence God
  for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 23. 24. yea read through the 8th. 9th. 10th. chapters
  to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and you shall find that all things under the law did
  but serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, and were but as it it
  were a figure for the time then being, imposed on the Iewes untill the time of
  Reformation i. e. till Christ came.</p>
               <p>Now as to the Minor in the <hi>Prosyllogism,</hi> which is this
  <hi>viz.</hi> that the holinesse which sanctified the Jews seed, was the same,
  and no other then that which san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified all the other appertenances of that
  Covenant, tis but a folly for me to offer to prove it, sith Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>
  himself (the man that most earnestly pleads the present being of that same
  holinesse in believers seed as in the Iews seed of old) doth little less then
  clearly confess it, in the 3 and 4 page of his birth priviledge, where he
  writes thus, <hi>viz. common things dedicated for holy service, and use are
  holy, a people by nature sinners, dedicated to the Lord, are for holy use and
  service of the Lord, when others are for the service of Idols, therefore
  Ierusalem a City, none of the holiest for any transcendent holiness of the
  Inhabitants thereof, is yet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Evangelist the holy City, by reason
  of the Temple, and worship there that were holy and from thence</hi> (saith he)
  <hi>this observation follows, A people that enjoy Gods ordinances convey to
  their issue a priviledge to be reputed of a society that is holy, to be
  numbered amongst, not unclean, but holy persons,</hi> in proof of which
  observation among other things he saies thus, <hi>viz. The land of their
  ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation where they dwelt and injoyed this peculiar priviledge is ordinarily
  stiled the Holy Land, being the land of Emanuel, and the language there spoke
  the holy language, being a mark to discern the people of God, the
  distinguishing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimminating Epithite given to them was still holy, even
  all of this root who were branches of Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, all of this lump
  whereof Abraham, Isaac, Iacob were the first fruits, they peculiarly had this
  honor to receive, &amp;c. and that in infancy, &amp;c. distinction from all
  others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which words of his (collectively considered) must needs bear
  such a sense as this, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the things that were else wise
  common, were holy things, and in such sort as the City <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was a
  holy City, their Temple a holy place, their service, which we know stood mainly
  in offering of gifts and sacrifices, meats drinks, divers washings and carnal
  ordinances for that time onely, a holy service, their land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
  it self a holy land, their language a holy language, and in a mannet every
  thing of theirs was discriminated by the term holy, from what ever was then
  counted common and unclean among the Gentiles, in such sort that people were a
  holy people, and their issue reputed, not an unclean but a holy seed.</p>
               <p>If this be his sense, then me thinks its a very sensless thing
  for him to affirm that same holinesse to be removed from all other things, that
  were the subjects then denominated by it, and to remain onely in people and
  their seed; but if he deny this to be his sense in those recited words of his,
  I think he must either crack his conscience to evade the disadvantage that
  accrues to his cause by owning it, or else grant that he was not sensible of
  what he wrote, for I see not how he can shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle those sentences into any other
  sense: And as he, so Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> that backs him in his opinion of
  birth-priviledge sayes the same, and confesses p. 81. of his book <hi>that the
  common nature of holiness is one and the same in all these, viz. Priests and
  Levites, Temple, Altar, Sacrifices under the law, and in the children of
  believers and their unbelieving yoke-fellows spoken of 1 Cor 7. 14. i. e.</hi>
  a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to God, for so saith he there, <hi>i. e.</hi> in such sense as
  the Priests, Levites, Temple, Altar, Sacrifice, &amp;c. were sanctified, both
  children of believers, and <pb n="115" facs="tcp:42067:64"/> also unbelieving yoke-fellows
  are here said to be holy and sanctified.</p>
               <p>It being then in both Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> and Mr.
  <hi>Baxters</hi> own account one and the same holinesse, whereby as well the
  seed as the land, people, Priests, sanctuary and service were all denominated
  and distinguished as holy, which surely was no other then a meer
  <hi>ceremoniall</hi> holiness, its but folly for me to say more in proof of
  this, that it was the same: nevertheless forasmuch as here is the very
  foundation of all your falsity and confusion, in that you either do not, or
  else will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern a difference between the time of the law, and the Gospel
  (for <hi>distingue tempora, et reconciliabis scripturas)</hi> and for that also

  which that it may yet more plainly appear, I beseech you let it be considered,

  Temple was but tipical of the Gospel Churches (I mean not steeple houses, but
  congregated and truly constituted Assembliesof people, 1 Cor. 3. 17. Eph. 2.
  21, 22. 1. Pet. 2. 5.) And as that nation and people in their holiness, and all
  other particulars was tipicall of the Saints, where ever locally scattered, yet
  mistically imbodied, and not of Christian nations collectively taken, and as
  their holy land and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom flowing with milk and hony was typicall of the

  their holy City of that holy City new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that is to come down
  from God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. and their holy high priest-hood of our holy,
  harmless, undefiled high-priest Christ Iesus, and their holy priest-hood of all
  the elect of God, sanctified and anointed, not with material ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oyle, but
  the holy spirit it self, or holy unction to be a holy priest-hood, to offer
  spiritual sacrifice, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. and as their holy Altar and

  <hi>Paul</hi> in that place you may by the wayif you be not stocks and stones
  take notice thus far of your selves, that the same holy persons that by that
  holiness had a real right to be, not onely in the neerest service, but highest
  office also in that Church of the Jews cannot possibly upon the meer account of
  that holinesse, plead a right to participate of Gospel-priviledges, and if the
  holiness of the priests, which was superiour in degree, though the same in kind
  with that of the people, and seed, by which they were priviledged with so high
  a standing in that Church, could not inright them of it self, unless they were
  obedient to the faith also, to membership and communion with
  gospel-fellowships, in gospel injoyments, shall we suppose the bare
  birth-holiness that was in the Jews seed (if it were now as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the
  fleshly seed of believing Gentiles, as tis certain there's no such matter) can
  entitle, and give right to enter and partake of Gospel-priviledges, without
  more ado? be asham'd <hi>Sirs</hi> to assert it) and lastly as all that
  holinesse of the old Testament and tabernacle, and things thereunto belonging
  was no more then a type for the time then being, of the New Testament and
  Tabernacle and holy things thereof, so even that fleshly seed of
  <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that birth-priviledge and Covenant-holinesse, which they
  then had, yea that law of infants Church-membership and Circumcision, which Mr.

  when you question him for his <hi>Dedicative</hi> holiness, if so once why not
  now? If under the Law, why not under the Gospel? the same phrase you commonly
  be speak us in when we demand a reason why you fancy such a
  <hi>birth-holiness</hi> in your fleshly seed; in return to which against such
  time as you shall satisfy us so slenderly in this case, so as to say <hi>Si
  aliquando quare non nunc?</hi> arguing from the manner of things under
  <hi>Moses,</hi> that thus or thus they ought to be under <hi>Christ,</hi> and
  deriving a holiness from that of the Jews fleshly seed, to the fleshly seed of
  believing Gentiles under the Gospel, I leave this double question upon
  record.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Si aliquid quare non quicquid?</hi> If you will have
  any thing holy with that <hi>Ceremonial</hi> holiness now, why not every thing
  that then was so?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Si aliqualitèr, quarè non

  all as well as the <hi>Pope?</hi> though where he doth all, and more too he
  shall at last have no thanks for his labor.</p>
               <p>The next and last argument whereby I shall prove that typical
  holiness of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> fleshly seed, as well as of all the other
  subjects denominated, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by it under the Law to be but
  <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> and now nullified under the Gospel, is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:42067:66"/> 
                  <hi>That holiness whose contrarily
  opposite commonness, sin, and uncleanness was but meerly ceremonial, and is now

                  <note place="margin">3. Argum.</note> 
                  <hi>be but ceremoniall, and

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that holiness, which successively through all
  generations (for the time then being) did denominate, and distinguish the
  Iewes, and their progeny from all people, and their seed as holy, is a holiness
  whose contrarily oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, commonnesse, sin, and uncleanness was but
  Ceremonial, and is now abolished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo, That holiness which did distinguish the Iews and their

               </p>
               <p>The Major cannot possibly he denyed, for <hi>contrariorum eadem
  est ratio, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariorum uno sublato tollitur alterum:</hi> of contraries take
  away one, and the other cannot remain in its opposition to it, any longer: as
  for example, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monness, sinfulness, prophanness, uncleanness of some
  meats, flesh, birds, beasts, places, persons, and their natural seed above
  others being ended, the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of some meats, flesh, birds, places,
  persons, and their natural seed above others must without controversie be at an
  end also: under the law, whilest there was more uncleanness, commonness, and
  prophanness in such and such meats, places, people, then in others, there must
  necessarily be by the Rule of contraries more holiness in these meats, places,
  people, then in those: but under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel there being no more uncleanness,
  commonness, or prophanness in these things, places, or persons above those,
  there must be consequently no more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in those than these: and so if
  there be no such birth holiness as was under the Law, there can be no such
  birth uncleanness as was under the Law: and if no one man in all the world is
  more sinfull, common and unclean then another by nature, no man can be more
  holy then another by nature, with the holi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ess direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposite to that uncleanness, but all men must now be
  all alike by nature or fleshly birth.</p>
               <p>And now as to the Minor, <hi>viz.</hi> that the commonness,
  sinfulness, prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or uncleanness of some mens fleshly seed above
  others, oppositely answering to the holiness with which the <hi>Iewes</hi> seed
  was then holy above others, is totally destroyed, as well as all that
  uncleanness, and the holiness contrary thereunto, that was then in some meats,
  and flesh of birds and beasts above others is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved to be a truth
  to any which will impartially consult and compare these three scriptures each
  with other <hi>(viz. Act. 10. v. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 28. Act.</hi> 11. 2. 3. 4.

  which if you be not either so blind that you cannot, or so obstinate that you
  will not see, <hi>you</hi> cannot avoid the sight of this very thing,
  <hi>viz.</hi> that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Commonness, and uncleanness that was once in
  some meats, and flesh of birds and beasts forbidden as abominable to be eaten,
  under the Law, but also the commonness and uncleanness that was in some people,
  and their seed more then in others, even that sin and uncleannesse of the
  Gentiles by nature in respect of the Jews, who were then forbidden to eat with
  them, as a thing for them unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and abominable, is not at all in being now
  under the Gospel, but quite abolished and consequently the birth holiness
  directly opposite to it abolisht also; which holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness yet, that was as then in
  the <hi>Iews</hi> by birth, and nature M<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Blake</hi> is not ashamed to scrue his wits to
  prove a translation of from the <hi>Iews</hi> seed now, to the seed of
  believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentiles under the Gospel, and that from the last of these
  Scriptures, <hi>viz. Gall.</hi> 2. verse 15. then which, I testifie, no
  Scripture doth more clearely confute him.</p>
               <p>As to those Scriptures cited out of <hi>Act.</hi> 10. and
  <hi>Act.</hi> 11. these things are well worthy your observation in them first
  that <hi>Peter</hi> (though under the Gospel) stood yet opinioned (God having
  not till now discovered the contrary to him) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <pb n="119" facs="tcp:42067:66"/>
  to the Law that such meats as were then forbidden to be eaten, and such people
  as were not Jewes by nature, but by nature sinners of the Gentiles, were
  unholy, unlawfull, unclean and abominable for him that was a Jew, so much as to
  eat, or eat with still.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that God did not shew unto <hi>Peter</hi> in that
  vision any such thing as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> dreams and seems to himself to have
  the vision of <hi>viz.</hi> that he had now translated that old commonness and
  uncleannesse that was once in the Gentiles by nature, and stated it now upon
  such as are Iews by nature, and such as are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture descended from
  unbelieving parents, and contrary wise translated and stated the birth-holiness
  that was once among the Iews by nature, because they now believe not, upon such
  Gentiles by nature, as are born of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving parents; for no more then
  Gentiles by nature can I call them still, for all their parents faith, not
  Christians or Saints by nature (as Mr, <hi>Blake</hi> frivolously fancies them
  to be) that are descended from Christian parents after the flesh onely; for
  howbeit the fleshly seed of the Iews are Iews still, both <hi>naturâ,
  nomine et natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> yet the meer fleshly seed of Christians and Saints,
  are not Christians and Saints at the same rates in Gods account (how ever they
  are in the Popes and his) any more then the meer fleshly seed of believers are
  by <hi>birth, nature, name and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> believers as much as their parents,
  which that they are Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself, will not surely be so shameless
  as to assert: and though he tells us a trifling tale, that the name of
  <hi>Christian</hi> would not, long hold in any family, or among any people if
  it be not so, that as <hi>Iews</hi> are <hi>Iews by birth, so Christians are
  Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> p. 6. yet I tell him again 'tis no great matter whether it do
  or no, yea 'tis not onely worth nothing, but worse then nothing to have the
  meer name and title of Christian, communicated and derived from parents to
  children, from generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to generation without the nature, for thats the main
  mischief that hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread all Christendom, and fill'd it with a thousand
  Antichristians to one true Christian indeed. Secondly, as simply as he saith
  God provideth for a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in succession of that name from age to age,
  yet I know no such provision that God hath made in his word for any such thing,
  as the continuance of the meer name of Christian in one family or nation, by
  any such birth-priviledge or propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation thereof from Christians to their meer
  natural posterity, but all the provision that hath been made in this behalf
  hath been made by the Pope and his priest-hood. Yea if God himself had took
  order for any such matter, then me thinks the name Christian should have been
  continued to this day among the posterity of that Gospel Church of the Hebrews,
  i. e. those many thousands of Iews, which in the primitive times turned
  Christians, yea then so many thousands of the Iews, which then believed, and
  became Christians <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 20 might have multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as easily by this
  time into one Christian nation at least, by the pastoral power, improvement,
  and sanctity of Saint <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> i.
  e. those few Gentiles, which at first believed there, did at last by the
  pollitick power, improvement and subtilty of <hi>Sir Simon the Pope,</hi> his
  supposed successour increase and multiply into so many.</p>
               <p>And as God did not shew unto <hi>Peter</hi> in the forenamed
  place, that he had now removed that birth priuiledge, and old Covenant
  holinesse from the Iews by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the natural seed of believing Gentiles,
  so</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he shewed him point blank that he had now quite
  abolished, and put an end to that old outward carnal, legal, ceremonial account
  of things, and persons as holy and unclean, so that now as no meats, nor flesh
  of birds and beasts should be counted common or unclean, in relation to other,
  as aforetime, so no men now or flesh of men <hi>however born,</hi> should by
  meer fleshly birth of such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, though unbelieving Gentiles, be counted
  common or unclean in relation to others, whether Iews by nature, or believing
  Christians natural seed, as more holy by birth then they, for being cavill'd
  with by them of the circumcision i. e. the birth <pb n="120" facs="tcp:42067:67"/>
  priviledged Iews, for eating things common and unclean, and for associating
  him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with men uncircumcised, common or unclean (for so both the Gentiles or
  un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision in the flesh, and many meats eaten by them, and prohibited to
  be eaten by the Iews are call'd and accounted under the law) he tells them
  chap. 11. that he was at first as scrupulous of the thing as themselves, till a
  voice from God declared to him that he must not now call any thing common or
  unclean, that was so before, in respect to other, as more holy then it in the
  sense of the law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause whatever was then common or unclean in such a sense,
  God had now clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed i. e. destroyed that denomination and distinction that
  was between it, and what answerably to it was wont to be called holy: And that
  these discriminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms of holinesse and uncleannesse are as much abolished
  in all people and their fleshly seed as in all other flesh of birds and beasts
  appears undeniably chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 10. 28. where he tells <hi>Cornelius</hi> the very
  same as concerning men, who afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time were by birth common or unclean, that he
  tells them of the circumcision as concerning other creatures which aforetime
  were called common or unclean. <hi>Ye know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that tis an
  unlawful thing</hi> (meaning according to the will of God under the law)
  <hi>for a man that is a Iew to keep company, or come nnto one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
  nation</hi> (for then indeed Iews by nature might not eat with such as were by
  nature sinners of the Gentiles) but now <hi>God hath shewed me that I should
  not,</hi> (meaning in these dayes of the Gospel) <hi>call any man common or
  unclean:</hi> observe the words I beseech you, and consider them with reference
  to the vision it self, and that further exposition of it, which <hi>Peter</hi>
  himself makes in the 11. chapter, and the result thereof is no less then this,
  <hi>viz.</hi> That as there is now nothing, i. e. no meats, or flesh of birds
  or beasts, or other creatures more unclean, unholy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful or abominable to
  be eaten then other, as some was under the law, so there is not now any man by
  birth, nature or nation unclean, in such sense as the Gentiles were of old in
  reference to the Iews, but that all men are alike now by birth, and none by
  nature more holy or unclean then other, in such wise as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, none by meer
  nature neerer to God or further off, more or less the people of God or accepted
  with him, further then by holinesse or unholinesse of life they are
  distinguisht. In further consideration of which v. 34. 35. <hi>Peter</hi>
  opened his mouth again and said thus, <hi>of a truth I perceive that God is no
  respecter of persons,</hi> i. e. now he accepts not men of one nation above
  another, no not Iews by nature, more then those which heretofore, in relation
  to that birth-holiness the Iew had, were counted sinners of the Gentiles, nor
  any one man above another, as meerly descended of such a parent, <hi>but in
  every Nation he that feareth him, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteousness is accepted with
  him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though therefore time was, when the natural seed of Jewish
  parents (as meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so born, though proving never so morally wicked, profane
  and unbelieving in their own persons) were still accepted of God (I mean in
  that outward ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial sense onely) as his people, his peculiar chosen
  generation, his holy nation, above all nations of the earth, though (as Mr.
  <hi>Blake</hi> saies truly) <hi>none of the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est for any transcendent
  manners of the inhabitants:</hi> yet when Christ came the hour came, and now
  is, wherein no fleshly birth or being of this or that nation or parentage or
  natural descent and condition doth invest one person or people with this
  birth-priviledge of acceptation before God as his people, or denomination of a
  holy people or seed more then others, the hour now is, wherein in meer infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
  there's no more distinction at all between persons as holy and unclean, wherein
  faith and not typical but true holiness, or holinesse of truth onely,
  <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 17, 18. 24. makes the distinction between the Church of the
  Genliles, and other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; wherein there's no difference between Iews and
  Gentiles, and the children of both save according as they are called, and have
  hearts purified by faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. 15. 9. wherein the righteousness
  and grace of God is unto all, and upon all alike without difference in time of
  infancy, and upon all alike that believe a <pb n="121" facs="tcp:42067:67"/> alike when
  they come to years, <hi>for theres no difference,</hi> Rom. 3. 22. wherein
  <hi>there is neither Iew nor Greek, circumcision or uncircumcision,</hi> more
  unclean or holy by nature either then the other (as of old) but all alike
  accounted sinners or holy according as they live sinfully or holily, and not
  other wise. If then we may not call any man, of what blood, nation or parentage
  soever under the Gospel common or unclean, (as God shewed <hi>Peter</hi> that
  he should not) no not those who (sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the abolishing of that unclaanness)
  are as abominable by birth as the Gentiles were in the time of the law, then
  may we not call any man, howevernaturally descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, holy upon the same
  account of that his natural birth, in comparison of others.</p>
               <p>Whereupon though Christ called the <hi>Canaanites</hi> by
  nature, dogs in reference to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and their seed the children,
  while that birth-uncleanness or holinesse stood yet unabolished, <hi>Mat.</hi>
  15. 12. 26. after which example Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> takes such blind boldness to
  himself, as to imagine the new born infants of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and unbelievers may
  respectively be so denominated still, yet he takes upon him much more then God
  ever gave <hi>Peter</hi> leave to do, or any man else in those dayes of the
  Gospel, if he now call any person by meer naturall birth more holy, common or
  unclean then other.</p>
               <p>Tis not now fleshly birth, nor circumcision, nor uncircumcision
  in the flesh that <hi>discriminates</hi> men as Saints or sinners,
  <hi>children</hi> or <hi>dogs, holy</hi> or <hi>unclean, in Covenant with God
  or out, fit or unfit</hi> (further then non-age unfits all alike for such a
  thing) now to be of the visible Church, which is not now nationall neither as
  heretofore it was, for under the law this only made men communicable or
  incommunicable one with another, this was the cause why those of the
  circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision cayilled with <hi>Peter</hi> till he satisfied them to the
  contrary, because he being a Iew by nature, and circumcised in the flesh went
  in to men uncircumcised, and did eat with them, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. from eating
  with whom he dissemblingly withdrew himself at another time, fearing them of
  the circumcision, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. which way of discrimination of persons each
  from other as holy and unclean, fit or unfit for Church-communion each with
  other by meer fleshly birth and circumcision in the flesh, was but a type, the
  Antitype whereof is not this, <hi>viz</hi> that believers fleshly seed are
  <hi>holy, Saints, Gods people, Church-members</hi> by birth, and contrariwise
  unbelievers fleshly seed by nature <hi>dogs, swine, sinners, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean</hi> in
  such sort as the seed of Iews and Gentiles were under the law; but this rather
  and indeed <hi>viz.</hi> that believers themselves spiritually born by faith in
  Iesus Christ, circumcised in heart, doing <hi>Abrahams</hi> works, are now the
  children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a peculiar people, a holy nation, neer and deer
  unto him, that must dwell in his house, and be fed and refresht with that
  bread, of which there's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and vnbelievers themselves, unholy ones in
  heart and life, never new born, nor become children to God and <hi>Abraham</hi>
  by faith in Christ, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining uncircumcised within, under the unclean
  lusts of the flesh, are those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ones, and sinners with whom communion is
  not to be held by the other in Church bodies, those <hi>dogs</hi> and
  <hi>swine</hi> to whom the childrens bread is not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, nor holy
  things given even the holy ordinances of the Gospel, nor pearls cast i. e. the
  precious particularities of professed believers, <hi>viz.</hi> baptism and the
  supper thrown away upon them.</p>
               <p>Moreover as God shewed <hi>Peter</hi> by that vision
  <hi>Act.</hi> 10. that not any man now, no not a Gentile by nature may be
  called common or unclean any more then one that is a Jew by nature, so he shews
  him the same ore again, in a round reproof by the mouth of <hi>Paul Gal.</hi>
  2. 11. to 19. where tis recorded how shamefully he separated from eating with
  the Gentiles for fear of offending the Jews, of whose cavils with him in this
  kind he had had some experience before, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. as if he had been
  opinion'd still according to the law, that such meats as were then unclean, and
  such people as were then sinners by nature, in reference to the then holy seed
  of the Iews had been no lesse then abomination still for him, or 
  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:42067:68"/> any Iew by nature to eat of, or eat with, and likewise
  how roundly he was dealt with by <hi>Paul,</hi> who minded him of that, which
  he knew well enough but was too willingly ignorant of at this time,
  <hi>viz.</hi> That these who were but a while since by nature holy, were now no
  holier by nature then Gentiles, that were then also called sinners of the
  Gentiles, but that as to that old account of ceremoniall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness and
  holinesse, whereby they were distinguisht from the very womb be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they were
  now all alike <hi>by</hi> nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Iews no more holy then other
  men, and other men even Gentiles no more sinners <hi>by</hi> birth then
  <hi>they,</hi> all that partition wall of birth holinesse and uncleanness,
  propinquity and alienation that did once difference some men from other <hi>ab
  incunabilis</hi> being broken down, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves such as must look upon
  themselves as dead to that law, whereby <hi>they</hi> stood the children of God
  and Saints, and all other men sinners by fleshly birth, and under another law
  now even that of the Gospel, <hi>by</hi> which there is no other <hi>way</hi>
  of being <hi>holy</hi> and becoming so much as <hi>relatively onely,</hi> much
  lesse <hi>really</hi> the children of God, then that of faith in the <hi>Lord
  Iesus</hi> for the Iews themselves more then for <hi>any</hi> other: and
  therefore in case they now go about to build again the things that
  <hi>they</hi> had destroied (meaning that <hi>fleshly</hi> birth holinesse
  which <hi>they</hi> had before disownd) <hi>they</hi> should make themselves
  transg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>essors in so doing: this
  <hi>verily</hi> is the <hi>very</hi> sum, sense, and scope of that Scripture
  <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>cry</hi> down all the old ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial distinctions of men
  <hi>by</hi> nature and Nation, to beat down all that old birth priviledge and
  preheminence of one person however descended above another, as to Gospel
  participation and communion: out of which <hi>yet</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake
  blindly</hi> takes his text, where upon to build again a certain <hi>birth
  holinesse</hi> in one mans <hi>fleshly seed</hi> above another, the
  <hi>very</hi> thing that <hi>Paul</hi> there declares rather to be abolished,
  most perversly propagating to the meer <hi>carnall</hi> seed of
  <hi>Christians</hi> that antient tipical and now ended holinesse of <hi>Iews by
  nature,</hi> who though the seed of believing <hi>Abraham</hi> himself,
  <hi>yet</hi> have none of it at all now themselves, nor <hi>yet</hi> whilst
  <hi>they</hi> had it could be admitted <hi>by Iohn</hi> to <hi>baptism,</hi>
  and gospel priviledges upon that onely account, and <hi>yet</hi> if it still
  remain as the thing intitling to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances both must have it, and a right
  also to <hi>baptism by</hi> it, <hi>specially</hi> if Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> own
  tenet be true, that <hi>the ground of a childs admission to baptism is not the
  faith of his immediate parent onely,</hi> as he saies it is not p. 24. of his
  birth priviledge, <hi>but the promise made to believing Ancestors at a great
  distance; for as</hi> he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  father Abraham,</hi> so say I <hi>Abraham</hi> being not <hi>onely</hi> the
  remote parent of <hi>Iosia,</hi> but of all the Iews that are born at this day
  also, if the Iews have no right now from their own immediate parents that in
  the primitive times, or more lately believed not the Gospel, yet may they have
  right, if right at all be to be had to Gospel priviledges from the parents
  faith at a distance, from their remote fathers <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and
  <hi>Iacob,</hi> whose believing of the Gospel, is as well worthy to intitle all
  their seed to this day to the Gospel promises, as the faith of any believing
  Gentiles onely.</p>
               <p>I cannot therefore but stand amazed in my mind to consider how
  miserably Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> mistakes himself in taking that text, from which
  to prove a present birth holinesse in the infants of believing Gentiles, which
  if there were no other to compare it with, doth sufficiently clear it of it
  self alone; how much more if compared with those forecited out of <hi>Act. 10.
  Act.</hi> 11 that there is now no such holinesse and uncleannesse <hi>as
  was</hi> once between <hi>Iews by nature,</hi> and such <hi>as</hi> were then
  called <hi>sinners of the Gentiles:</hi> yea if that distinction of <hi>Iews by
  nature, and sinners of the Gentiles</hi> spoken of <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 15. were
  now in being, &amp; remaining unabolished, it would be so farre from
  establishing that indeed it would utterly overthrow what Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>
  pleads for from it, and instead of advancing the naturall seed of believing
  Gentiles so high in holinesse as he would have them to be by birth, debase 
  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:42067:68"/> them rather into a worse condition then I dare say any
  unbelieving Gentiles seed is in by birth (as to such a kind of uncleanness as
  they once were denominated by) in all the world; specially if it be so as he
  him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self saies p. 10. of his birth priviledge, viz. <hi>That the seed of
  believing Gentiles are now under one of those two heads in the text:</hi> For
  if that distinction be not now destroyed, and all men by birth come under one
  of those two denominations now; under which of them I trow will Mr.
  <hi>Blake</hi> rank the infants of believing Gentiles? he will not render
  himself so ridiculous sure as to say they are <hi>Iewes by nature,</hi> and
  therefore (unless the distinction be totally taken away) he must say they are
  by nature <hi>sinners of the Gentiles,</hi> which in the sense of the Law, is
  as if he should say <hi>Doggs, unholy, common,</hi> and <hi>unclean,</hi> and
  more then we our selves dare say of any now new-born infants under heaven, as
  in contra-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to other.</p>
               <p>If he say they are neither <hi>sinners of the Gentiles,</hi> nor
  <hi>Iews by nature</hi> neither, then either he must say they are some third
  thing, which if he do Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> himself will contradict <hi>Mr.
  Blake</hi> in that, for he asserts pag. 10. of his Birth priviledge that
  <hi>the seed of believing parents under the Gospel must be lookt upon under one
  member of this division in this text, and that the Apostles distinction and
  distribution is so full and compleat that a third cannot be assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or</hi>
  else he must grant that this distinction is now wholly ceased under the
  Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which because tis the giving up of his whole cause he will be very
  loath to do, and therefore rather than do so (then which yet, if he well
  understood what is best for him he could not do a better thing) of the two he
  choses, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contradiction of himself, to rank them under a third
  head, to assert them to be some third thing, namely a sort of carnal holy seed
  of his own, and the Clergies coining, a Relative holy seed of their own
  consecrating, a faederall holy seed of their own feigning, a holy seed hatcht
  in their own heads, which are neither fish, nor flesh, nor good red herring,
  nor <hi>sinners of the Gentiles,</hi> nor <hi>Iews by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> nor
  <hi>Iews besides nature</hi> neither, i. e. by personal faith as all true
  Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are, but <hi>quartum quoddam,</hi> a certain fourth thing, called
  <hi>Christians</hi> from their mothers womb, or ever they are so much as
  christen'd into the name, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipled into the nature, and yet for all this a
  seed set forth in such a transcendent manner, as if all other were in
  comparison of them by very descent, p. 13. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, sinners, unholy, dogs, and
  filthy swine.</p>
               <p>'Twere enough to make a wise man wonder to see how superlatively
  Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> magnifies this seed of believing Gentiles, above the seed of
  all other men in the world, even above the fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,
  and Iacob</hi> themselves, who only, at least mainly; had the promise of this
  priviledge of transmitting a Covenant holiness to their issue, and this but
  typically, and for a time neither, even till that seed should come, i. e.
  Christ and believers in him, to whom all, and only the Gospel promises were
  made.</p>
               <p>He calls them <hi>Children of God,</hi> and <hi>Saints by very
  nature, Little ones of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in reference to infants of
  <hi>Infidells,</hi> which with him are <hi>little ones of Babylon:</hi> and yet
  (to go round again) this <hi>Babilon</hi> (in his own opinion) is not the
  <hi>Infidells</hi> but <hi>Rome,</hi> a Church of Christians (in name at least,
  as well as the Protestant na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) and consequently (to go round again) in his
  own opinion such (see pag. 26.) as transmit a covenant-holiness into their
  seed, so far as (in his own sense) to make them <hi>little ones of Sion</hi> as
  well as the other: and yet for all this too (to go round again) though it be
  <hi>execration</hi> with him to hurt the <hi>little ones of Sion,</hi> i. e. in
  his sense the infants of such as are not <hi>infidels,</hi> but <hi>Christians
  in name,</hi> yet (to go round again) it is an happy thing to dash the
  <hi>little ones of Babylon</hi> i. e. in his sense infants of <hi>Papists</hi>
  who yet are Christians <hi>nomine tenus</hi> and not infidels, and consequently
  <hi>(secundum se)</hi> the <hi>Lords heritage</hi> and such as have Christs
  name u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, and such as for a <hi>Turk</hi> to persecute were to be guilty
  with <hi>Saul</hi> of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting <pb n="124" facs="tcp:42067:69"/> the Lord Jesus p. 30.)
  against the walls p. 29. which <hi>little ones</hi> of both <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and
  <hi>Babylon</hi> he is yet much mistaken in when all is done, in taking either
  of them for fleshly babes of what parents soever, <hi>Syons little ones</hi> in
  the true spiritual or gospel sense, being the Saints themselves onely, and not
  their fleshly babes as such, even the little ones <hi>Christ, Paul, Peter</hi>
  and <hi>Iohn</hi> speak of <hi>Mat. 10. 42. Gal. 4. 19. 1 Pet. 2. 2. 1
  Iohn</hi> 2. 1. 12, 13. And <hi>Babylons babes</hi> being no other then the
  <hi>C C Clergies</hi> adult disciples, or <hi>A A Antichristian C C
  Christian</hi> creatures.</p>
               <p>And (to take notice a little more yet of Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi>
  high expressions of the <hi>birth holinesse, birth happinesse, birth mercy,
  birth dignity</hi> of meer nominal Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans fleshly seed, as they lie
  scattered up and down in p. 28. 30. 31. 32. 33. and other pages of his book) he
  calls them a <hi>seed in relation to God as well as their parents,</hi> [and so
  indeed they may soon be, if he mean of such meer outside Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians as he
  doth] <hi>the inheritance of God, the Saints and Servants of God, a holy seed,
  having a royall transcendency above all others, as onely worthy the name of a
  people, injoying the light, nigh unto God, a people of hope and expectation,
  children that have blisse,</hi> [as if they were actually and inalterably
  already stated in it, and possest of it, and all other infants and people as
  inalterably designd and devoted universally to cursing and damnation, as having
  no Gospel at all belonging to them, no not that Gospel which is to be preached
  to every creature] <hi>a seed by birth priviledge to be baptized, p.</hi> 27.
  [which yet is more birth-priviledged then <hi>Abrahams</hi> own seed could have
  <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. even before their birth priviledge did perish from them]
  <hi>such as have a large and full right to all the ordinances of God, and
  priviledges of the Church, appertaining to members, as they shall be capable of
  their use, by personall faith and good demeanor when at years, and grown
  up,</hi> [and I wonder who hath not the like upon those terms? even infants of
  infidels surely as well as they when at age, and whilst infants, they are no
  more capable of the use of any ordinance then the other.]</p>
               <p>He tells us, these by birth are <hi>of the houshold of God, of
  the Citizens of the Saints</hi> [tis much he said not fellow Citizens in
  <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. sure twas because he bethought himself
  of their uncapableness of fellowship, for all their membership] He tells us
  that these <hi>are orderly admitted, i. e. by baptism then which Scripture
  knows no other admission, for no sooner do we read of a convert</hi> (saith he)
  <hi>but we presently hear of his baptism</hi> [whereas of all the converts in
  Christendom that sit under the ministry of the <hi>Pope, Prelate</hi> and
  <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi> I never knew one in all my daies baptized after their
  conversion of him by preaching, till being converted from them to the Truth as
  it is in <hi>Iesus</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and come to us, and then we immediately
  baptize them indeed; but as for them, tis impossible for them so much as to
  preach the Gospel in all Christendome, in the way and words in which <hi>Peter,
  Ananias, Philip, Paul,</hi> and all the first and purest preachers did, while
  they suppose all they preach to to have been baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in infancy (for what
  Priest in Christendom can say to his parish repent and be baptized for
  remission of sinnes, arise and be baptized and wash away thy sinnes; he that
  believeth and is baptized shall be saved (as they of old said, <hi>Mark 16. 16.
  Act.</hi> 22. without gross absurdity having christn'd them all long before he
  ever preacht to them?) neither do they baptize any at all after conversion, and
  the best baptism they dispense in token of remission of sins (so long before
  either sins commission, or the sinners conversion) is at best but meer rantism
  neither.]</p>
               <p>He tells us that <hi>those have right to all the immunities of
  this house, to all the priviledges of this City of God</hi> (meaning the Church
  here below) <hi>and have title to all Christs visible ordinances, that they
  belong to Christ, and therefore must partake of that which is of Christ, and
  being of the houshold they must therefore have of the food of the houshold, yea
  the stewards of the mysteries of God must be accountable in case they deny it
  them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>[And yet till they are at years not any one of them may
  participate (as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <pb n="125" facs="tcp:42067:69"/> say) of any one of those

  <hi>God,</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> in <hi>Abraham,</hi> allied to them all as
  their own, upon no other then that bare account of being the meer fleshly seed
  of Christians, and that in name only, should yet when all is done have neither
  any earthly kindome, inheritance or Canaan (as the Jewes had while they enjoyed
  this birth-priviledge) whereby to prove them real heirs of something more then
  bare ordinance (which is but bondage without the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) not a dram more
  of any outward earthly felicity, power, glory, peace, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp;c. then
  what may befal the seed of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> as well as they;
  nor yet the least measure of reall right, or true and immediate title to the
  heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> kindome, and inheritance by any promise thereof made
  to them as such, i, e. upon the meer account of being such mens seed, unless at
  years they become believers, and obedient to the Gospel themselves, upon which
  terms of belief and obedience when they come to age, the seed of the vilest
  wretch under heaven may be an heir of it aswel as they: for in infancy the seed
  of believers have not <hi>hard themselves from heaven, or deserveed exemption,
  by any actuall transgression, <pb n="172" facs="tcp:42067:70"/> from the generall state of
  little infants declared in Scripture,</hi> any more then the Infants of
  believers, so but that dying in infancy they may be saved equally with the
  other, and when they grow to years the seed of the best believers in the world
  have no promise without faith to be saved ere the sooner because they are such
  mens seed, but in the way of faith or believing themselves, the seed of the
  worst ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Christ that ever breath'd have as much promise and assurance
  from God that they shall be saved as the other. Sirs where is the blessedness
  you speak of? where the great preheminence of believers seed under the Gospel
  doth now ly, in respect of which they are stiled by Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and
  others such great and high born heirs, nor yet what inheritance it is, which by
  that bare fleshly birth onely they are heirs to, I could never yet find of my
  self, nor learn from any of you. As for the Iews by nature though they were not
  heirs of heaven it self, upon the meer fleshly birth of <hi>Abraham</hi>
  without faith <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. yet they were not called heirs meerly as
  born after the flesh in vain, for there was an <hi>earthly Canaan</hi> which
  they were heirs of, and God gave to them by promise as they were meerly the
  fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which also they actually enjoy'd according to
  the promise, whether they had any faith or moral holinesse yea or no, during
  that time of the law, but as for the fleshly seed of believing Gentiles, to
  which Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> translates the same birth priviledge of being holy and
  high born heirs by nature, they stand heirs (by that natural birth onely) of
  neither the earthly nor yet the heavenly <hi>Canaan:</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>
  feeds us with an empty title of <hi>holiness by birth, heirs by birth,</hi> but
  can't possibly say we are heirs of heaven by birth of believers, unless we
  believe our selves, and believing themselves those that by fleshly birth are of
  unbelieving pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are by promise heirs to it as much as any: nor can he say
  that the seed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Gentiles are heirs by birth (as the Jews were) of
  the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and yet if the same birth priviledge, birth
  holiness, birth happiness they had, be now (as he saies it is) made over to
  such in the same way as twas once standing among the Jews, me thinks as they
  were disinherited from their land through unbelief, when once the time of
  standing by faith onely came, as well as from their title to the names of
  Church, people of God, a holy seed, heirs by birth and such like, so those that
  succeed them in their whole birth priviledge, should have their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance as
  well as the name of heirs by birth, or else how is there such an equaliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of
  the body of Christians with the Nation of the Jews, as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>
  pleads there is p. 8. how can we be said to be as largely and in as full and
  ample manner invested with, and installed into the glorious fleshly
  birth-rights, which the Jews of old were dignified withal if we have not a
  plenary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the outward benefits and blessings of the land of
  <hi>Cana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of that inheritance, which God then gave to those Iews by nature,
  to us and our fleshly seed, as well as of the outward oracles and ordinances?
  besides what a poor pitteous piece of birth priviledge is it, to be adopted
  instead of the Jews into the meer name of holy sons and heirs, and yet to have
  nor a foot of that land which was the Iews inheritance, in respect to their
  fruition of which by right of a promise to <hi>Abraham</hi> and them, they were
  then honoured with that name of heirs? but if it be said that we are now by a
  birth of believing parents heirs (as they were then) of the heavenly
  inheritance, and the true eternal <hi>Canaan</hi> and kingdom whereof that was
  but a type, though we have not to do with that typical land it self as they
  once had; I still strongly deny it that either any Iews by nature then were, or
  any of the fleshly seed of believing Gentiles now are, by the faith of their
  fathers onely heirs by any promise at all of the kingdome of heaven, or any
  further at all then as dying in infancy they never deserved exemption by
  actuall trangressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or living to age they believe themselves, and so

  grown to age, I say still the fleshly seed, even of such fathers as never had
  any faith, are by that faith of their own heirs of the kingdom, which God hath
  prepared for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <pb n="128" facs="tcp:42067:71"/> that love him of what parents
  soever, and shall (so dying) assuredly inherit it once, and that by promise as

  the fullness of the things respectively per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining to each Testament, which in

  heirs by it, and all other the Ordinances of Divine Service, which the first
  Covenant then had, and in a manner every thing else under the <hi>Law</hi>
  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated thus far to the Gospel Covenant, as that they were types and shadowes

  alike relating imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to that <hi>Old Testament</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi>
  as parts thereof, and were not parts, but paterns only of the new; nor was
  <hi>Circumcision</hi> any other then an ordinance of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
  and not a direct rule for us to square or steer by in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing any

  7.</p>
               <p>Though therefore both Covenants were in being, i. e. the
  <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Gospell,</hi> before either <hi>Moses</hi> or
  <hi>Christ,</hi> the one concerning the <hi>Earthly Canaan</hi> to a fleshly
  seed in a <hi>Type;</hi> the other a <hi>Heavenly Canaan</hi> to a spiritual
  seed as the <hi>Antitype;</hi> yet are they said to begin the one in
  <hi>Moses,</hi> the other in <hi>Christ,</hi> because these two were
  respectively the two <hi>Mediatours</hi> of these two <hi>Covenants,</hi> and
  as it were the two several <hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Law givers</hi> to the two
  seeds, or the two several families of <hi>Abraham, viz.</hi> the two
  <hi>Churches</hi> under the Law; and the Gospel, the fleshly Israel, and the
  spiritual, the <hi>personal</hi> comming of which two <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> and
  abiding for a time in their several houses, did perfect what was lacking in
  them before in point of outward Ordinances, and institutions, and from
  thenceforth, i. e. from the several periods of their presence with them,
  establish them in a more compleat posture then before, and each Church
  severally in its own proper order. <hi>Moses</hi> then was the Mediator of the
  <hi>Old Testament,</hi> established upon Earthly promises: and so gave precepts
  accordingly; but <hi>Christ</hi> the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the new, which is called a
  better <hi>Testament</hi> established upon better promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.
  6. and so gives his precepts not by the mouth of <hi>Moses</hi> but as he
  pleases.</p>
               <p>Besides all this, though the Covenant of Circumcision made with
  that fleshly holy seed, began before <hi>Moses,</hi> yet whether that
  denomination of a holy seed, a holy Nation, and people did begin so high as
  <hi>Abraham,</hi> or before such time as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had
  according to Gods command to them, ceremonially sanctified by the bloud of
  sprinkling and dedicated both the Book of the Covenant and all the people, and
  all the vessells of the Ministery, and all other things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to that
  Tabernacle (for both that holy people and all their ceremonially holy things
  whereby you need not be ignorant unless you will that the holiness of that seed
  and their sanctuary was the same, and began and were to end both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
  were first consecrated, didicated, purified, sanctified all at one time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
  <hi>Moses Heb.</hi> 9. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. &amp;c.) whether I say the holiness
  of the <pb n="131" facs="tcp:42067:72"/> seed began so high as <hi>Abraham</hi> is a thing
  so out af doubt to me, that I dare say that as the holy land was not relatively
  holy till they came into it, so the holy seed, as well as the other holy things
  of that Covenant, were not ceremonially consecrated, nor form ally sanctified,
  nor vouchsafed that title of a holy seed, though vertually they were a choise
  seed before, till a little before they were to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, and howbeit I
  challenge no man, yet I intreat any man in the world to shew me if he can where
  they were denominated and distinguished from all other people as unclean by
  that term of <hi>a holy people</hi> till God intituled them so by <hi>Moses,
  Exod 22. 31. ye shall be holy men unto me neither shall ye eat any flesh that
  is torn of beasts, ye shall cast it to doggs:</hi> which place compared with
  <hi>Levit. 22. 8. 9. Deut.</hi> 7. 6. chap. 14. 2. chap. 26. 19. doth so
  plainly shew these two things.</p>
               <p>First, That the holiness there spoken of began but
  thenceforth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it was but a certain ceremonial distinction, and
  a holinese op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to that kind of defilement, which might be contracted by
  eating of unclean beasts, and so fully ceased in <hi>Christ,</hi> that I even
  blush to read Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and have been ashamed in my mind to hear some
  <hi>Independents</hi> also bring those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein God called Israel a
  holy people to himself, to prove, that an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched believers meer
  fleshly seed is now by nature holy in the same sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then let us hear the conclusion of this whole matter: of the
  things that have been spoken this is the summe, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are

               </list>
               <p>The Middlemost of which, because your fellow laborers against
  the Gospel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that chiefly in their books, I have treated on last, and
  most largely, and I now say three things of it in special.</p>
               <p>First, That it is a Holinesse which once was, but now is not in
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it is a Holiness which of it self, when it was in
  being, as it was at the beginning of the Gospel before Christ crucified, could
  not without faith and moral holiness interest the persons in whom it was seated
  in any of these three things, <hi>viz.</hi> Gospel Promises, Gospel
  Priviledges, or Gospel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not the premises, for they were made to
  <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Christ</hi> and his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual seed; not his own
  fleshly seed upon such terms, as bare birth of his body, or such holiness and
  righteousness as was under the Law intituling to <hi>Canaan Rom. 4. 13. 14.
  Gal.</hi> 3. 16. 29.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not the priviledges, <hi>viz.</hi> Gospel immunities,
  and Church-membership, for those that could plead they were under the typical
  freedomes of the old house, or Church under the Law, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed
  only were, are denyed by <hi>Christ</hi> to be that holy seed that should stand
  in the Gospel house, that was now to be built, or share in that spiritual
  freedome which the sonne gives, which is the only freedome indeed, unlesse they
  did <hi>Abrahams</hi> works, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 32. to the 40<hi rend="sup">ta</hi>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor yet the Ordinances, no not so much as
  <hi>Baptism</hi> the initiating ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it self, for when that old holy seed
  remaining yet under their relative and denominative holiness unabolished, did
  plead it as to baptism, they were put back by <hi>Iohn,</hi> and not permitted,
  barely upon that account upon which they stood in the old house, without faith,
  unless they now believed and amended their lives whose repulse of them when
  they came to his baptism was this <hi>viz. begin not to say we have Abraham to
  our Father &amp;c. Mat. 3. 7, 8, 9. Luke</hi> 3. 7. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:42067:73"/> Thirdly, suppose baptism were entailed so
  to that holinesse and a meer fleshly seed of believers, or of believing
  <hi>Abraham</hi> himself as truly as tis true it is not, yet how grossely were
  you overseen <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in undertaking to prove the holy spirit by it
  to be in infants, for thats the <hi>probandum,</hi> the very thing which by the
  holinesse of infants you went about to make good, for the minor of your first
  fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism which was this, <hi>but little children have the holy spirit,</hi>
  being denied <hi>was proved</hi> (say you) <hi>first by their faith, secondly
  by their holinesse, thirdly by those Eulogies given them in Scripture:</hi> if
  then by holinesse you mean this kind of holiness, I mean ceremonial, which once
  was in the Iews by nature, you have a wet
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>le by the tail then indeed, for
  ask but Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and he'le tell you, that that holinesse was in
  thousands who yet had not the <hi>holy</hi> spirit, yea in truth all the Iews
  had that holinesse, of whom not a <hi>Tenth,</hi> even then when they had it,
  were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in infancy, or at years morally sanctified, or indued with the
  holy spirit: and as I have said these three things in special, concerning that
  one kind of holinesse, so I have three things in general to say in short
  concerning al these three sorts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, one of them was in infants of old, and now is not but is
  vanisht, and when it was it proved not the spirit <hi>viz. ceremonial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, another is, but nothing to your purpose, I mean the
  proof of the spirit, though it be in most infants <hi>viz.
  matrimonial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the other is not yet come for ought yet appears to
  infants <hi>viz. morall,</hi> which if it did appear to be in them
  <hi>positive, qualitativè,</hi> as an inherent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not
  <hi>negative</hi> onely so as to be without sin, or absolutely innocent (for
  abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute innocency hath no need of baptism) then I should say something more
  to you, but you see it doth not, therefore though you said nothing then (as I
  wish since I had suffered you to do) from infants holinesse, to the proof of
  their having the spirit and right to baptism, yet I have searcht, but cannot
  possibly find what holinesse you could possibly have proved it <hi>by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been the larger here, though you gave me but a bare hint,
  by the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation onely of infants holinesse: first, because here lies indeed
  the very principal <hi>knot</hi> and <hi>basis</hi> of this controversie, which
  you erring in are <hi>consequently</hi> erroneous in all <hi>your wayes,</hi>
  for <hi>Error minimus in principio fit major in medio, Maximus in fine.</hi>
  And as for all other arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> they are but as
  <hi>Auxilliarie</hi> hereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, because I am willing also sith you call so much for
  it, to give out my own grounds for the truth, by the way as I go along in
  disproving of your false ones, that you may either yield to them if found, or
  answer and disprove them, if unsound and rotten: in the residue I shall be so
  much the briefer.</p>
               <p>The next argument whereby you undertake to prove infants of
  believing parents to have the holy spirit, is drawn from those <hi>Eulogies
  given them in Scripture, not inferior to those of the best Saints,</hi> from
  whence you thus argue.</p>

  by which sense how ever <hi>your infancy</hi> is clear cut off from all
  capacity of having it, and so you are confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by your own party in the very
  corner stone of this your <hi>babish building;</hi> but Ile 
  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:42067:74"/> give you the advantage of your own personal
  <hi>Tenet</hi> let it be what it will (save only that forenamed common sense of
  the spirit, wherein I have told you, tis in all men, who yet are not therefore
  to be baptized) I say again, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children may be blessed
  by Christ outwardly only, as with health, peace, plenty, fruitful seasons,
  <hi>Mat. 5. 45. God is good to all, and sends sun and rain i. e.</hi> all
  temporal blessings on the <hi>good and evil, just and unjust.</hi> The
  blessings of bodily protections, as to be guarded with <hi>Angells</hi> from
  heaven from dangers, and mischiefs; which is another of the <hi>Eulogies</hi>
  you here instance in, which to save your selves and me some labor, Ile take in
  hear, it being but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral blessing, from which it follows not that such as
  are blessed with it must consequently have the holy spirit; also bodily
  salvation from and sanation of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, distempers, by Christ, who is a
  <hi>Saviour</hi> of the body; these blessings of the body, the barn, the
  basket, and the store, health, and external happinesse persons may be, and
  often are blessed with from <hi>God,</hi> who fills their bellies with hid
  treasure, so that they prosper and are not plagued, when yet they are wicked in
  their lives, and far from the holy spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly; If you take <hi>Christs</hi> blessing (as in this
  place you must, for its so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and plainly expressed in one of the three
  Evangelists you quote, which write all the same thing in some difference of
  prase) for his praying for the persons whom he blessed, I say that even
  spiritually persons may be blessed by Christ in prayer for them, yea blessed
  with the blessing of the spirit it self, as <hi>de futuro,</hi> and and yet
  not, <hi>pro presenti,</hi> have the spirit: for Christ blessed his disciples,
  <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 50. i. e. prayed for them that they might be endued with the
  spirit, and yet that he then prayed for, or by lifting up his hands, to the
  father then blessed them with, did not come on them till some while after: in
  this sense <hi>Isaac</hi> blessed <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Gen. 27. 28. 29. Iacob Ioseph,
  Gen.</hi> 40. 15. 16. the <hi>High-Priest</hi> all the <hi>People, Num. 6. 23.
  Moses</hi> all <hi>Israel</hi> before his <hi>departure</hi> also,
  <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 1. &amp;c. and yet they were not actually possessed of the
  blessings just then, when they blessed them, but along time after. There is a
  blessing by <hi>promise,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> blessed <hi>Abraham</hi> with a
  Son, and the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> a blessing by <hi>Prophesy</hi> as
  <hi>Iacob</hi> blessed all his Sonnes fortelling, as I may say, their several
  fortunes <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. a blessing by <hi>Prayer,</hi> as in the forenamed
  places, and in this of Mat. 19. 13. Mark 10. 16. And there's a blessing by
  <hi>putting into actual possession, and fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a mercy,</hi> so God
  blessed <hi>Israel</hi> with the real enjoyment of the Land of
  <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and all temporal blessings in that earthly place, &amp; so
  <hi>Antitypically</hi> will once bless all the spiritual seed of
  <hi>Abraham</hi> with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places by <hi>Christ
  Iesus Eph.</hi> 1. 4. Now the three first waies of blessing persons are all
  concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to come, and sometimes a long while after; yea in prayer
  <hi>Christ</hi> blest all that ever should believe on him through the word to
  the worlds end, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. so long before the thing befell them, that it
  was even before most of them were born.</p>
               <p>As to your <hi>Minor</hi> then, wherein you say, little children
  were blessed by <hi>Christ,</hi> I grant it to be true, but not in any such
  sence as truely argues at all that in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy they had the holy spirit.
  For</p>
               <p>First, it of the two most plainly appears that his blessing was
  no other then bodily infirmities, which are as incident to infants as men, and
  the end for which they brought them shews the utmost he did to them, which was
  not that he should baptize them (as I shall more clearly shew by and by) but
  that he should touch them, and put his hands on them, and pray: no question
  twas in order to heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for twas at a time when he healed many others, if
  you compare this passage as tis in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. with the first and second
  verses of the Chapter: yea <hi>v.</hi> 15. tis plainly expressed what he did,
  i. e. he laid his hands upon them, and departed thence; besides <hi>Luke</hi>
  saies they brought little children unto him also that he should touch them:
  which <hi>[ALSO]</hi> shews that others were brought too, as sick folks
  commonly were, <hi>because vertue went out of him, so that as many as touched
  him were made perfectly whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:42067:74"/> Secondly, if he did blesse them
  spiritually in his prayers, twas doubtless (yet all whom he healed were not so
  blessed neither, witness the nine <hi>Leapers)</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to come,
  and if he prayd for their particular salvation, yet they might not immediately
  have the spirit. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What ever twas he did to those particular infants
  (which whether they were believers infants or no too no man can tell) for many
  sought him for loaves, and outward mercles, and many for healing of themselves,
  and children, meerly that they might be rid of their burdens, on whom yet he
  had compassion for all that) yet first what is this to other infants, or to
  ours that cannot now be brought to his person? besides what more to believers
  than unbelievers infants? what more to any then to all? away therefore for
  shame with such <hi>dry Divinity</hi> as this: <hi>he touched those children
  and blest them, that were then presented to him, that he might touch them,
  therefore all believers infants have the holy spirit, and must be
  baptized:</hi> away with such <hi>dribling dispute</hi> also, it is not fit for
  <hi>Christs School,</hi> nor mans neither.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Eulogie</hi> you mention is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
  Their being declared to have right to the Kindome of heaven, whence your

  have actual and present right to it, all which notwithstanding (mark what I
  say, for it cuts in two the sinews of your consequence) twill not universally

  spirit, for though nothing can come between such as finally believe, and the
  kingdome, and that fulnesse of the spirit that comes in with it, of which the
  spirit here is an earnest, and the spirit it-self as the earnest, so as to cut
  them off from the future possession of both (God who cannot ly having promised

               <p>The next <hi>Eulogy</hi> given to little infants, whereby you

               <p>Bare simple innocency, harmlessnesse and freedom from hurt
  proves neither holinesse, nor holy spirit to be where it is, it being capable
  to be not onely in infants, who in respect of age and stature, though not of
  kind and nature, are in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way at least an uncapable subject of the
  other, but also in creatures by kind uncapable at any time of the spirit,
  <hi>viz. doves, sheep, lambs,</hi> every of which (as well as <hi>infants)</hi>
  are set forth also as examples of meeknesse, patience, innocency, silence,
  under suffering, as the <hi>Ant</hi> is also for diligence and forecast, the
  <hi>vine</hi> for fruitfulnesse, the <hi>Serpent</hi> for wisdom to the Saints,
  and yet have not thereupon the holy spirit, yea <hi>Eulogies</hi> for some one
  particular natural excellency, qualification and indowment, and those <hi>not
  inferiour to those of the best Saints</hi> may be given, and that as an example
  for the Saints, not onely to other creatures and innocent infants, but also to
  such as are elsewise injurious, and no way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary to others at all, <hi>e.

  were well in his wits or no, that should argue from those <hi>Eulogies</hi> to
  those holy spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly from which innocency yet, if it would follow that the
  spirit is in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, it must be in all as well as some: for is one Infant
  more free from actual sin, and in point of innocency propounded as our pattern

  Ile onely add one argument of mine own from the very places you quote, from
  which if either men did not dote on them, because they are found in the <hi>old
  Liturgy,</hi> and the new <hi>Directory,</hi> or were not resolved to take tag,
  rag and long tail, to scrape together even all the impertinencies that ere they
  can meet with, in proof of infant baptism, rather then to forgo it now they are
  ingaged in't, there is no clearer consequence in the world then that infants
  are not to be baptized, and then Ile pass on to your other proofs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If those very numericall infants spoken of in those very
  places Mat. 18. Mar. 10. Luke 18. from whence, and from the carriage and
  practise of Christ there toward; them, the priest-hood pleads the baptism of
  other infants, of whom Christ did never so individually declare (as he did of
  these, that they should be brought to him, and that of such is the kingdome of
  heaven) were not baptized by Christ, nor his disciples in the primitive times
  of the Gospel, which are our pattern, then it follows not from the example of
  these infants that other infants are, but rather that they are not to be
  baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But those very infants spoken of in those very places from
  whence &amp;c. were not baptized either by Christ or by his disciples
  &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo it follows not from the example of those infants that
  other infants are, but rather that they are not to be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is most undeniably clear, for by what warrant
  may we take upon us to baptize other infants, when those infants were not
  baptized that were brought to Christs own person, and whose particular personal
  right to the kingdom (as you your selves say) Christ there declares? for tis
  contended by youthat the word [<gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>But to deal ingenuously and faithfully with you the text
  viz. Acts 2. 41. might hold forth a just colour of an objection, if you had so
  applied it against the Argument gathered out of v. 38. 39. for the baptizing of
  infants, for if they who were baptized were such as gladly received his word
  verse 41. then it doth not appear out of this place that infants were at that
  time baptized with the rest, because they could not receive the word, much
  lesse gladly, least of all expresse their gladnesse by any visible profession.

  children <hi>Act.</hi> 2. were not baptized in their own persons, but accounted
  as baptized by God, accepting their parents baptism on their behalf as well as
  though they had been baptized in their own persons, which if it be so, is of it

                     </gap>em, but also cherished that
  baptism the children had received.</hi> In which expressions he is so
  unexpresse, or at least so whifling to and fro, that he must have more brains
  then I, that can pick out of them what he means distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by them: for in
  some of them one would think he meant as if those infants were 
  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:42067:76"/> baptized before they came to Christ, and were brought
  onely now for imposition of hands, in some again as if they had bin then
  baptized, and brought then to both that and to the other, but which of the two
  he means it matters not, so long as I shall prove by and by, that twas neither
  this nor that.</p>
               <p>But by the way I desire all men to take notice of Dr.
  <hi>Holmes</hi> his proofs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he strives to clear it that the infants
  brought to Christ-had then the ordinance of imposition of hands, and so had
  been baptized before, and how they are not onely nothing cogent, but so clearly
  cogent and consequential to the very contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he that reads them with
  reason must needs conclude the Doctors right eye of reason was not a little
  bleared (not to say absolutely blinded) by one thing or other when he wrote
  them: yea all he saies for the clearing of that, doth clearly contradict and
  overthrow it.</p>
               <p>In proof of what he saies in this particular <hi>viz.</hi> that
  the ordinance of laying on of hands was dispensed to these infants that were
  brought to Christ, he alledges the practise of the Antient times, at it is
  mentioned by <hi>Pareus, Caluin, Hoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Marlorat, Bullinger, and Cotton</hi>
  too, which all according as Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> himself hath recorded their
  words, first severally in chap. seventh of his animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions p. 58. 59. 60
  and <hi>summarily</hi> ore again as it were to set his folly on high that all
  might see it, in the 10th chapter p. 85. 86. do testifie <hi>uno ore</hi> with
  one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that <hi>in antient time infants were not admitted to imposition
  of hands, nor confirmed in the fruition of Church estate thereby,</hi> that
  being indeed as himself asserts, from them too, one prime intent of that
  ordinance which is one of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation doctrines to Church fellowship, till
  to use the very same phrase he quotes out of them, <hi>being past their
  childhood, past innocency grown up to years, youths at least, that made
  profession of faith, they were received not to that onely, but to the supper,
  and all other Churh liberties also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which term <hi>Antient times</hi> tis not easie to discem
  neither from him so indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly doth he utter himself in this, as also in
  most of his other matter, whether he mean the true and pure primitive times of
  the most antient fathers the Apostles, which is our rule, or the new and
  post-primitive times of the fathers since them, which though declining daily
  into corruption, the priest-hood hath ever for ought I find, in more account
  then the other, yet by one clause he seems more to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to the Apostles
  dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> in p. 85. the last line, where after he had cited the
  fore-named Authors, and their joint opinion concerning the dispensing
  impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of hands in foretimes to grown persons onely, he adds this viz.
  <hi>so that the original of imposition of hands came down from the Apostles;
  thus far these lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued men</hi> (saith he) but which ere he means it makes
  much what one for him, there being no times, primitive, or posteren wherein the
  ordinance of laying on of hands was given to infants, unlesse in that midnight
  of popery wherein they gave the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them also: for is it not equally
  absurd, and (if worse can be) worse then senseless, for a man to gather so
  undoubtedly (as he doth) that Christ at that time dispensed the ordinance of
  laying on of hands to those infants in <hi>Mark</hi> 10. in their infancy,
  because the Apostles and Churches in after times, whose pattern he was, did
  dispense it to persons ever, when they were past childhood, and grown to years?
  doth not this rather most evidently evince one of these two things
  <hi>viz.</hi> either that the imposition of hands Christ gave to these infants
  was not that ordinance the Apostles in antient Churches practised to men at
  years onely (and that it was not I shall shew by and by) or else that the
  Apostles did dispense the Gospell ordinances to other subjects then Christ
  himself did, whom they were to follow, <hi>viz.</hi> he to infants, and they
  onely to persons past infancy? Moreover if the Apostles did say on hands at
  years, though Christ in infancy, what if Christ had baptized those infants in
  infancy also? are we more tied to follow his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that, then in the
  dispensation of laying on of hands? you see therefore how the Doctor though he
  borrows his friend Mr. <hi>Cottins</hi> reading, and reasons ou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of 
  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:42067:77"/> antiquity (as himself sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>p. 86. of his animadversions) to make good a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
  assertion, and argumentation of his own <hi>viz.</hi> that those infants which
  were then brought to Christ had both baptism and imposition of hands, and even
  there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptism before, because <hi>imposition of hands</hi> then, yet makes
  so bold with it for all that, as flatly to contradict not himself onely, but
  Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> also, whose judgement is far founder then his in this case,
  by inferring two things from Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> words, clean contrary both to
  Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> own opinion (for he professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denies that these infants
  had so much as baptism) and to the true consequence of his words also (for Mr.
  <hi>Cottons</hi> words directly argue that both <hi>re verà,</hi> and in
  his judgement of old there was no dispensing the ordinance of <hi>imposition of
  hands</hi> at all on infants, till they were grown up to years. How little
  therefore the Doctor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be credited in his consequences a fool may
  see. Neverthelesse least any should more credit and cleave to Doctor
  <hi>Holmes</hi> his odd conceits, weo saies these infants had both baptism and
  imposition of hands, then to Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> candid concessions, and plain
  confessions that they had neither; Ile add a little to evince it, that they had
  neither baptism nor imposition of hands in any such sense as the Doctor dreams
  on from Christ at that time at all.</p>
               <p>First, that they were not baptized I argue thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If they were baptized. then twas either before they were
  brought to Christ, or else by Christ or his disciples then when brought to
  him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But neither before nor then.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>go as yet not
  at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you say they had baptism before they were brought to Christ,
  I wonder how they came by it, or where they had it, or who administred it, sith
  this surely was their first appearance before Christ and his disciples, and how
  any else but they could do it ask your selves, who make more ado then needs
  about the bare admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strators of baptism, as if they must needs be none but
  <hi>Ministers in orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> if you say <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> might do
  it, my <hi>no</hi> is better then your <hi>yea</hi> if I say he might not, for
  as you have nothing but thought to ground your thoughts on that he did bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
  any infants, so I have <hi>Iohns</hi> one deed declaring that he did not, by
  whom nor you nor I neuer find that any were baptized but in doing of that,
  which infant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> cannot do
  <hi>viz.</hi> confessing their sins. Yet of the two this seems rather to be Dr.
  <hi>Holmes's</hi> fancy, that they had been baptized before they were brought
  thither, for p. 61, they are supposed here saith he, to have been before
  baptized, because they were brought to this higher addition, of imposition of
  hands, and blessing.</p>
               <p>If you say they were then baptized when brought, <hi>it must be
  either by Christ or his disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ples,
  but neither by him nor them,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo not at all at that time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First not by Christ, for he baptized not all with his own hands,
  onely he is said to baptize because his disciples did it by order and
  commission from him <hi>John</hi> 3. 22. 23. with <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 12.</p>
               <p>Secondly, nor were they brought to him for any such end as that
  he should baptize them, but that he should <hi>touch them and pray,</hi> which
  so soon as he had done, <hi>he went his way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly not by his discipl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s, for they were not brought to them, but to him, and if you say it
  seems they came to them first, because they blam'd those that brought them,
  <hi>I</hi> say that argues plainly that they were not brought to be baptized,
  for if they had, and had bin also the true, lawful, wonted, and known subjects
  of baptism to the disciples (as they must have been ere this time, if either
  <hi>Iohn</hi> or themselves had used to baptize infants among the rest) they
  could not have been so ignorant and forgetful of, or carnally contradictory to
  their own and <hi>Iohns</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and wonted fashion, as so frowardly to
  find fault with, and forbid their coming to be baptized now, but would have
  rejoiced in, rather then reproved their forwardnesse in it, for tis most
  certain that they had been not onely spectators <pb n="141" facs="tcp:42067:77"/> of
  <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptism, but dispensers of baptism themselves also long enough
  before this time, to have been instructed in the true subject of it, for the
  bringing of those infants was after <hi>Iohn</hi> was beheaded, but
  <hi>Christ</hi> by his disciples had baptized in <hi>Iudea</hi> before
  <hi>Iohn</hi> was in prison, and whilest <hi>Iohn</hi> was yet himself
  baptizing in <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>on;</hi> yea
  and had made, and baptized more disciples than <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides the ground of their rebuke of those that came with
  little children was no doubt their care, and loathness to have <hi>Christ</hi>
  too much prest, in which case they sometimes rebuked others, when they throngd
  upon him so fast for healing, that they had no leasure so much as to eat
  bread.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they came not now under <hi>Imposition of
  hands</hi> in that sense the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> treats on, is most evident.</p>
               <p>First, by the D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> own quotations of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Calvins,</hi> and
  M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Cottons</hi> readings concerning the practise of the first times; for
  so far are they from clearing such a thing, as he alledges them for, that they
  clear the clean contrary, the subjects of that imposition of hands, they speak
  of, being only professors of the faith, and not infants; yea how doth D
  <hi>Holmes</hi> belabor himself to prove it, that those to whom the primitive
  Churches dispensed <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> were persons grown to years,
  more then doth his cause good, and more then any wise man puts him to by the
  denial of it, but those that were brought to Christ for it here spoken of none
  other then very infants in their nonage.</p>
               <p>Secondly in that this ordinance of laying on of hands was not
  likely yet in use and being in this <hi>prae-primitive-</hi>period, wherein
  <hi>Christ</hi> laid his hands on these infants; the ends in order whereunto it
  was enjoined, and practised when it was, being such as in this juncture, not
  only infants, but also the very disciples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were uncapable of
  <hi>viz.</hi> (as the Doctors own quotations truly shew) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and full
  fruition of, confirmation in Church state, Gospel Church liberties,
  Church-fellowships in all Church ordinances, <hi>viz.</hi> the Supper, and
  suppicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and also the receiving of the holy spirit, none of all which
  were yet given to any, in such wise as afterwards they were, no not to the
  Disciples till either just before (as the Supper) or else after <hi>Christ</hi>
  was crucified: for howbeit matter for the Gospel Church, and fellowship was
  fitting, preparing and gathering in by preaching and baptizing even from
  <hi>Iohn,</hi> who began the Gospel two or three years before that, and the
  Gospel Church was as it were in a certain <hi>Chaos,</hi> or <hi>Congories</hi>
  of matter not yet digested into its perfect form, somewhile before the Jews
  Church was ended in Christ death, yet it came not to have its own formall
  constitution, in point of visible order, posture, fellowship, government,
  offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, discipline, endowments with the spirit, whereby they might be built
  up an habitation of God, and ordinance of laying on of hands in prayer,
  specially relating thereunto, till after Christ crucified, and ascended, the
  holy spirit being not yet come, because Jesus not yet glorified.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they came not for this but for another kind of
  <hi>Imposition of hands,</hi> which is otherwise called <hi>touching,</hi>
  which who ever had from him were (in case of diseases) made whole. They came
  surely for that laying on of hands which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Holmes</hi> himself speaks of
  p. 57. out of <hi>Hophman, viz.</hi> a laying on in order to healing, for which
  healing, by a touch of him, many men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren came, or else were
  brought to Christ, while others that were well came to hear him <hi>Mark 5. 27.
  28. 29. 30. Luke 6. 17. 18. 19. Mat.</hi> 14. 13. 14. 34. 35. 36.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> therefore that these infants
  had was not that which persons, when past infancy only, had in the Churches
  after, and for D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Holmes</hi> to say the Apostles and ancient Churches
  confirmed persons by prayer, and laying on of hands, when they were past
  infancy, and not in it, therefore surely Christ to the same intent and purpose
  laid hands on these in infancy, is equally absurd as to argue thus,
  <hi>viz.</hi> the Apostles and primitive times practised baptism to men and 
  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:42067:78"/> women onely confessing sin, and professing faith,
  therefore it is most fitting, and likely now to be the will of Christ, that
  persons should be sprinkled in their non-age: so brittle are all the bottoms
  you yet build on, but to proceed.</p>

  a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother controversie, of as large extent and consequence as this in hand, and
  ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will wave it here, yet not so as to decline the discourse of it
  with you, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion, any more then of the other; well then that they are
  not all Reprobates it is asserted by you and us too, but what is this at all to
  your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose? For</p>
               <p>First, is there no <hi>Medium</hi> between being a reprobate,
  and a present having the holy spirit? there were twelve Disciples at
  <hi>Ephesus,</hi> which had not so much as heard of the holy spirit, so far
  were they from having it yet, yet dare you say they were all reprobates? there
  were many men and women that believed the things spoken by <hi>Philip</hi>
  pertaining to the Kingdome, upon which the holy spirit had not yet fallen, were
  they all reprobates, because they had not yet received it? or those thousands
  <hi>Peter</hi> promised the holy spirit to, were they all reprobates, because
  they yet had it not, when he spake to them? yea millions of men ly yet in
  wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, and so far from having, that at present they rather scoff at the
  holy spirite yet dare you not say they are all reprobates; for some of them may
  turn at <hi>Christs</hi> reproof (for ought you know) therefore what
  consequence is there from not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reprobates, to a present possession of the
  holy spirit?</p>
               <p>Secondly, do you know so precisely which infants are
  <hi>Elect,</hi> and which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate,</hi> 
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:42067:78"/> as to take
  upon <hi>you</hi> to distinguish them <hi>by</hi> baptism? or are all infants
  of unbelievers <hi>reprobate,</hi> so that <hi>you</hi> may accordingly
  denominate them for such <hi>by</hi> whole sale as you do? Do not the infants
  of unbelievers very often prove be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and so elect, and precious? and as
  ordinarily believers infants (when they come to years I mean) prove reprobates?
  were not <hi>Asa</hi> the son of wicked <hi>Abia,</hi> and <hi>Iosias</hi>
  of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  branded for reprobates?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, to the plain perverture of the words of the the text,
  <hi>you</hi> quote to <hi>your</hi> own ends, instead of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
  between whose and the <hi>spirits</hi> being in men there is no small
  difference (for <hi>Christ may</hi> be in us <hi>by</hi> faith (I mean we may
  be in the faith) when <hi>yet</hi> he is not in us by his <hi>spirit,</hi> I
  mean before the spirit is yet given, witness all the disciples that believed,
  and were baptized with water, some while before <hi>Christ</hi> gave them the
  holy spirit, <hi>Act. 8. Act.</hi> 19.) instead of Christ I say you insert the
  spirit of <hi>God:</hi> you also wholly pervert the sence of the Apostle in
  that place 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. who speaks it not to infants, nor of them
  neither, but of persons that could both know and prove, and examine their own
  selves, of all which infants, were uncapable by your own confession; he wrote
  it of them to whom he wrote it, and so indeed, though you are slow of heart to
  consider it, the whole Gospel was written, <hi>viz. de adult is, &amp;
  adultorum officiis,</hi> of grown persons, whether parents or children, and
  their duties, but not for the use of infants in infancie at all.</p>
               <p>In the next place upon occasion of my denial that it can be made
  appear that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have the holy spirit to the making of them subjects of
  baptism you argue it on thus.</p>

  your own confession, and yet in this place I am now in hand with you say no

               <p>O <hi>Earth, Earth,</hi> hear the reasonlesse round abouts of
  these <hi>Logicians,</hi> they tell us in one place, that it is to be concluded
  by no lesse then necessary consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that believers infants (for of such
  onely they assert it) have faith and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spirit: by and by (to go round
  again) they tell us that it cannot be certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed what children have
  it, what have not, that the working of the spirit is not known to us, he is not
  bound to work it in all the children of Christian parents, nor barr'd from
  working it, in any of the children of In fidels, so that there can be no
  conclusion made: in one place they tell us that no judgement of science,
  concerning these or those infants having the holy spirit and faith, can be
  passed in their infancy, till the acts themselves be seen and examined i. e.
  till they come to years, and shew forth some fruits, and it appear
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> some acts and professions of
  it for a <hi>posteriore</hi> onely the discovery or habits is made: but
  elsewhere (to go round again) they tell us that it doth more plainly appear
  concerning believers infants in their infancy, that they have faith and the
  holy spirit to any one, that will not deny Scripture and reason, then the
  profession of any particular person at years ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to baptism, can make it
  appear of himself, as if it could not half so well appear <hi>a posteriore</hi>
  when we are at years and capable to profess and act faith, and shew forth the
  fruits of the spirit, whether we have faith and the spirit yea or n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>; as it may do <hi>a priori</hi> i. e.
  in infancy, before any act of faith or fruit of the spirit can be discovered,
  seen or examined.</p>
               <p>Moreover (to animadvert this present passage of yours yet a
  little further) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you say here, that the report of Scripture concerning
  little infants, which is Gods testimony, and to be preferred before mans, doth
  more plainly prove it that infants <pb n="145" facs="tcp:42067:79"/> have faith and the
  holy spirit then any particular mans testimony doth prove it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
  himself,</p>
               <p>I answer, first by denying that God in Scripture gives any such
  testimony at all concerning little infants litterally taken, that they have
  faith and the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if that phrase <hi>Mat. 18. 6. viz. these little ones
  which believe in me</hi> could have any such construction as of little infants
  litterally, yet I deny that he speaks of them any otherwise then by a
  <hi>Prosopeiâ</hi> as I said before.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if it were to be proved (as it never can be) that he
  speaks there of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and not figuratively neither, but plainly and
  properly, yet tis most plain that he speaks but <hi>indifinitely,</hi> not
  <hi>particularly</hi> of one infant more then another, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of <hi>Christians infants</hi> more then of
  <hi>infidels,</hi> so as that you can thereupon take on you (as you daily do)
  to distinguish which have the spirit which have not, and accordingly to admit
  these to baptism, and debar those, yea you your selves do ore and ore express
  it p. 5. 6. that what the Scripture declares Infants to be, it declares them so
  to be in generall, specially while any particulars of them have not yet barrd
  themselves by actual sin, or deserv'd to be exempted from what the Scripture
  hath in general declared them to be: so that all this that you have brought
  thus far hath not the weight of a feather, to warrant your good opinion of one
  infant above another, and your practise of baptism to this or that particular
  infant (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a believers) rather then an unbelievers.</p>
               <p>It would be no plain but a muddy, totter'd confus'd implicit
  shufling kind of argumentation for me, if I were to give account why I baptize
  this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man or woman, and not others to argue thus indifinitly
  (as you do all along) <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man may forbid them to be baptized that believe and have

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Scripture declares that men and women may believe,
  and have the spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo men and women must be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If I should (I say) go on thus in generals onely not making it
  appear, that thers any faith at all in these individuals whom I baptize, more
  then in others, I should take him for little better then a fool, who should
  take me for a wise man in so ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, yet so and no otherwise do you argue,
  whilst when we put you to prove that those infants whom you baptize have title
  to it, in contradistinction to heathens infants, whose right to baptism you
  deny, you give us your account in these inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate terms <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Those that have faith and the holy spirit may be

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Scripture testifies that little children have faith

               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo little children may be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say what a bald way of arguing is this? wherein you conclude
  no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the particular infants, whose right to baptism we put you
  to plead, while you shut out other, then concerning those very infants also
  whom you so shut out.</p>
               <p>This is just as silly as if you being put to prove your own

               </p>
               <p>Without making any proof of your own faith in particular, whose

               <p>Besides the salsity of both the premises, there's no more at all

  indeed) be as truly concluded from them concerning all.</p>
               <p>First O the rottenness and infirmitie of the <hi>Major!</hi> it
  is most manifestly fals, for there are many things, which to doubt of may be a
  breach of Christian charity, which yet do not at present sufficiently
  appear.</p>
               <p>To doubt that this or that particular infant will hereafter live
  holily, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Gospel, may be a breach of Christian Charity, whose
  rule is ever to hope the best, till it sees the contrary, and yet that this or
  that particular infant will live holily and imbrace the Gospel when he comes to
  age, doth not yet so sufficiently appear, but that (as more plainly as things
  appear with you in infancie then at age by particular profession) it may more
  sufficiently appear when they are grown up, yea till then it appeareth not at
  all.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> also is false, for to doubt that this or that
  infant hath at present the holy spirit is no breach of Christian charity at
  all; sith (what hopes soever we may have of them as to the future) yet at
  present there is no evidence that they have it, nor yet any promise at all that
  it shall be given to them in infancy, nor at years neither till they believe
  and obey the Gospel: and as there is no promise of it to them in infancie, so
  in meer infancy there is no such use of it to them, as tis promised to be of
  unto believers; neither doth it either quicken, inlighten, convince, convert,
  comfort, or any other way officiate as a seal of redemption, and remission of
  sins to such as have no sins as yet to be remitted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if both these premises were as true as you suppose
  them, yet would it follow no more from them, nor from all <hi>you</hi> say
  toward the proof of either of them that believers infants have the holy spirit,
  then it would that unbel evers infants have it: in the evincing of which I
  shall only transcribe your <hi>Syllogism,</hi> and proof of the <hi>Minor,</hi>
  and instead of your term <hi>these little children,</hi> write <hi>little
  children of infidels,</hi> and so leave <hi>you,</hi> and all the world to
  judge, whether <hi>your</hi> own Argument doth not as clearly conclude
  unbelievers infants to have the holy spirit, as the infants of believers, and
  so consequently that all have it if any at all as well as some.</p>

               <p>First whereas you quere how those we baptize make it appear that

               <p>I answer I know no necessity of making it appear that persons
  have the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit before their admission to baptism, for though we find
  once that God Antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated his promise, and gave the holy spirit before
  baptism, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. yet I know not, nor yet do you, any promise there
  is, wherupon in an ordinary way we can expect it, of receiving the holy spirit
  of promise till after faith, repentance obedience, turning to God, baptism, and
  asking of it, <hi>Prov. 1. 23. Iohn 7. 38. 39. Act.</hi> 2. 38. chap. 5. 32.
  chap. 8. 16. 19. <hi>Luke 11. 13. Ephes.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as for the holy spirits appearing infallibly.</p>
               <p>I answer first it may possibly appear infallibly to be in some,
  in whom it is, as <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 44. 45. 46. 47. by sundry fruits, and
  manifestations of it, which may warrant us to say <hi>God is in them of a
  truth: Mat. 7. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 1 Cor. 12. 7. 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:42067:81"/> It may I say undoubtedly appear to be in
  men and women, but cannot any way at all so appear to be in infants, if we may
  believe your selves, who tell us p, 8. <hi>that infants have not the exercise
  and fruit offaith,</hi> and p. 18. <hi>that instruction of the understanding in
  matter of faith in some sort must go before any act of faith can be discovered,
  and that no judgement of science can be past upon infants, till the acts
  themselves be seen and examined, for</hi> a posteriore <hi>onely the discovery
  of habits is made, and that unlesse it could be certainly presumd what children
  have it, what have not there can be no conclusion made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And howbeit I am not of the seekers mind, that an appearance of
  the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in any person before baptism in water doth exempt him from it,
  but am well assured that it strictly rather ingages him to it, or else
  <hi>Peter</hi> could not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them in name of the Lord to be
  baptiz'd in water, upon whom the holy spirit fell Act. 10. but must rather have
  forbid it, as <hi>frustraneous,</hi> and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>superfluous;</hi> yet
  that the spirit should appear at all to be in men, in order to their baptism,
  much more that it should appear infallibly to be in them, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of no
  necessity that I know of, sith in the word its not required that persons be
  baptized with the holy spirit first in order to their baptism with water, but
  that they be first baptized in water, in order to their receiving the holy
  spirit <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. for the baptism of the spirit as tis promised onely
  to believers; so we believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, obeying the Gospel, and asking the holy spirit,
  tis signified to us as one thing that shall be given among the rest, in that
  very way of water baptism: so that its enough for us (as to the baptism of
  persons) to take cognizance of it that they believe and repent, which things
  though they cannot do without the spirit performing its common office of
  striving, drawing, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, inlightning, convicting of good and evil, sin and
  righteousness &amp;c. in all which it acts to the whole world, <hi>Gen. 6. Rom.
  1. 20. Iohn 16. 8. Act.</hi> 7. 51. yet they not <hi>only may</hi> do them
  without, but must dothem before <hi>they</hi> can <hi>by</hi> promise expect
  the spirit, in those special respects, wherein he is promised to believers, and
  calld that holy spirit of promise.</p>
               <p>And now because <hi>you</hi> ask how we know they have faith
  whom we baptize? I answer <hi>by</hi> their profession, which gives though not
  infallibility; <hi>yet by your</hi> leave, for all <hi>your</hi> preferring the
  <hi>Eulogies</hi> given in general to all infants above any mans personal
  profession for himself in this case a far clearer and better grounded judgement
  of charity concerning them, that they have faith, then that <hi>you</hi> have
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning infants, which at best is but <hi>charity mistaken</hi> for
  <hi>cruelty,</hi> whilst it takes that to be in infants, and that on pain of
  their damnation too they <hi>dying without it, viz.</hi> believing see p. 8.
  which infants are utterly uncapable of; and whilst it takes even that too,
  without which it holds no infants are saved, to be in but <hi>very</hi> few
  infants <hi>viz.</hi> believers infants onely, and so damns all other
  <hi>dying</hi> infants, which are far more innumerable, and as capable of
  faith, and as little barring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by actual sin from salvation, and as little
  deserving damnation, as the other, so that whether we or <hi>you</hi> plead the
  cause of innocent infants let the world judge.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>you</hi> suppose that because in <hi>charity
  onely</hi> we judge men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to believe, therefore we passe no other
  judgement then that of <hi>charity onely</hi> on them to be the subjects of
  baptism: herein <hi>you grossely</hi> mistake our grounds of baptizing, for
  though that of <hi>charity onely</hi> is the judgement whereby we judge them to
  be believers, <hi>yet</hi> that is not the <hi>onely</hi> judgement
  <hi>whereby</hi> we judge them to be the subjects of baptism, but as to that we
  go upon a judgement of <hi>certainty and infaellibility</hi> also, for though
  it be not infallible to us that <hi>every</hi> one that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses to believe,
  doth as <hi>truly</hi> believe as he professes, <hi>yet</hi> this is infallible
  to us concerning him that professes <hi>viz.</hi> both that he professes, and
  also that professing to believe with all his heart, so that we in <hi>charity
  may</hi> judge him so to do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he lie or no, he is <hi>by</hi> the rule
  of the word <hi>quoad no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> a
  warrantable, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and (as no infant is) infallible subject of baptism,
  for the word requires us to <pb n="150" facs="tcp:42067:82"/> baptize such, as after our
  preaching the faith to them, do <hi>truly</hi> professe to believe whether they
  believe as <hi>truly</hi> as <hi>they</hi> profest or no, for that indeed is
  not so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible to us, but it warrants us not to baptize <hi>any</hi>
  infants, who can neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nor professe.</p>
               <p>Moreover sith <hi>you say</hi> let us pass the same judgement
  upon little infants as <hi>you</hi> do, of whom in generall <hi>say you</hi>
  the Scripture gives so good a report, and against whom in particular no
  exception can be raised, and so the controversie shall be at an end.</p>
               <p>I tell <hi>you</hi> we do passe not the same, but a far surer
  judgement then that of <hi>charity</hi> upon infants dying in infancy; and have
  an hundred fold moreclear, and more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der opinion of them then your selves,
  whilst we have from the word well grounded hopes and assurance that no dying
  infant is damned, but you with over pleading the bare outward priviledges of
  some, most ignorantly damn 20 dying infants to one. But as to your judgement of
  <hi>charity</hi> concerning infants believing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby inrighted to
  baptism, or that same judgement of <hi>charity</hi> which we act toward
  professors of faith; you may dream as long as you will on such erroneous
  <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> but those that are awake to righteousnesse, and resolved
  to sin no more by popish superstition, know well enough that infants (though
  nere the worse for want out yet) cannot believe in Christ of whom they are not
  capable to hear, much less can they professe so to do, and thereby give that
  good ground, which right <hi>charity</hi> must have, whereupon to build her
  faith of this, i. e, to believe that they do believe, and believing are
  certainly to be baptized, so that we have <hi>chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> well grounded
  concerning infants, and such as comparatively to which <hi>your tender
  mercy</hi> to millions of them is <hi>meer cruelty,</hi> and yet the
  controversie is not ended, nor is likely to come to an end in such a way.</p>
               <p>Give me leave therefore a little to play upon you here with your
  own weapons, and to call for an answer from you to your own queres, and so it
  may be in a fair way towards an end in time, whereas then you plead the baptism
  of believers infants and no others, upon such a sufficient appearance that they
  have faith and the holy spirit. I ask</p>
               <p>First how do these make it appear that they have faith and the
  holy spirit since they cannot do it by profession.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how far forth do they make it appear to you?
  <hi>infallibly?</hi> or but <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably? your</hi> selves <hi>say</hi> not
  <hi>infallibly,</hi> for the <hi>spirit is not bound to all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of
  Christian parents, nor barrd from any of the children of infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, what judgement do you passe upon believers infants to
  be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of baptism, rather then other infants? that of
  <hi>charity?</hi> or that of <hi>certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> that of certainty
  <hi>you</hi> disclaim p. 18. in these words, <hi>no judgement of science can be
  passed, till the Acts of faith themselves be seen</hi> and examined, and in
  these also <hi>viz. unlesse it could be certainly presumed what children have
  the habit, what have not, for the working of the spirit is not known to us, he
  is not bound nor barrd, there can be no conclusion made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That of <hi>charity</hi> then is the onely judgement you passe
  on these, and, whereby <hi>you</hi> judge believers infants and no other, to
  have faith, the spirit and right to baptism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> which charity teacheth us <hi>praesumere</hi> &amp;c. to believe
  and hope all things &amp; hope the best concerning all till ye see the worst,
  <hi>especially since little children of believers have not by any actuall sin
  barrd themselves, or deserved to be exempted from the generall state of little
  children declared in Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then to close up all, let me but desire <hi>you</hi> to
  passe the same judgement of <hi>charity</hi> on all little infants, as
  <hi>you</hi> do on some, even upon the little ones of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, Infidels,
  Turks and Pagans (whilst infants) of whom in general, and
  <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discrimmatim</hi> the Scripture gives a good report, not commending
  believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants above them, and <hi>against whom in particular no exception
  can be raised,</hi> more then against the other, saving that one fault (of
  theirs) onely that they were not born of believings parents, which I hope you
  have so much <hi>charity</hi> as to pardon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:42067:82"/> Hope, I say as well of the infants of
  unbelieving parents, that they have faith and the holy spirit, specially
  <hi>since it cannot appear that these have by any actual sin barred themselves,
  or deserved any</hi> more then the other <hi>to be exempted from the general
  state of little infants declared in Scripture,</hi> and then the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
  between you and me, which is whether little children born of believing parents
  only, may be lawfully baptized, is like to be at an end, for then certainly you
  will either agree to it that all infants in the world, even of <hi>infidels,
  Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> (there being in the judgement of
  <hi>Charlty</hi> as undeserving damnation as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) may be and are (dying in
  infancy, though this with you is as heinous a thing as to say the
  <hi>Divels</hi> may be saved p. 7.) in as much possibility to be saved, and so
  at least in as much right as the others to be baptized, or else that no infants
  at all (it being not possible to be presumed certainly which have the spirit,
  and which not, and charity judging a like of all, till it see a difference) are
  at all to be baptized, both which being the very truth, I am content for my
  part to agree with you therein with all my heart.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>Dilemma</hi> I am well enough assured you can
  answer nothing in the least measure satisfactory, as the most judicious readers

  <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. in order to the true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of which,</p>
               <p>First, Mark well what it is that is there asserted concerning
  the meliority of the Gospel covenant above that of law, and you shall find it
  to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Gospel covenant whereof <hi>Christ</hi> is
  the Mediator is a covenant that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises better things, better injoyments,

  ever is or is not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, the promises of the Gospel are both in our

  and as far beyond the promises of the Law, as the <hi>substance</hi> is beyond
  the shadow, the <hi>City</hi> it self beyond the map of it that is on the wall;

  daies of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in case of observance of the Law, whereof
  circumcision was a part, though given before, and an Ingagement to them to keep
  the whole, when it should be given, and all this but as a Map, and type for a
  time of the Gospel Covenant, which was made and established on better promises
  with a better seed, i. e. not a carnal, but spiritual seed, not such as are of
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> own much less of any inferiour mens flesh, but such as are of
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and do his works, i. e. believers themselves this is
  our opinion, which if it do not rather confirm then contradict that meliori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
  of the Gospel-covenant, and its promises above that of the Law, which
  meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority is spoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. (your very selves being Judges of
  it) then surely <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> hath shut up your eyes from seeing that you
  see.</p>
               <p>But now as for your selves, who stand so much in vindication of
  the Gospel co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as a better Covenant then that under the Law, and that in
  that very respect, in which it is said to be a better Covenant <hi>Heb. 8. 6.
  viz. established upon better promises,</hi> ile shew you plainly how you are so
  far from making, it better then the Law, as that you make that of the Law at
  least equal to it, for whereas that Scripture which you quote saies plainly
  that the Gospel is a better Covenant than that of the law; forasmuch as it
  stands on better promises, yet that is never the better for you in your cause
  whose tenet utterly denies, &amp; flatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts that, for you say that
  the things promised in the word of the Law, which were signed, and (as your
  phrase is, not ours) sealed by circumcision, were the very same things that are
  promised in the word of the Gospel, and signed and (as you say) sealed in
  baptism, <hi>viz.</hi> the kingdome of heaven; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d howbeit this is most manifestly false, for in
  reality, though you jumble them together into one when it seems to serve your
  turn so to do, in such a confused way as preaches to the world your present
  ignorance in both the Law and the Gospel, the Law and Gospel are two distinct
  Covenants, established on two distinct kinds of promises whereof the one was
  typical of, and so inferiour to the other, the one an <hi>old o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> and a first that vanished
  before the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>new one, Gal. 4. Heb.</hi> 8. 6. 13. 9.
  1—12. 18. and though all that was then promised in the Law, and signed in
  circumcision, as well as circumcision it self were types of things under the
  Gospel yet the things then promised upon keeping the Law, and immediately
  signed to <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his fleshly seed by <hi>Isaac</hi> (save
  <hi>Esau</hi> and his seed that sleighted it) in that covenant of circumcision,
  which God gave him, were no other then that literal <hi>Canaan,</hi> that
  earthly land of promise flowing with milk and honey, and not the heavenly
  inheritance, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 8. &amp;c. for they that were heirs of the other
  according to the Law, are not thereupon heirs of this also according to the
  Gospel <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13.</p>
               <p>Now howbeit I say that be very false, yet you asserting it that
  the promise un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and under the Gospel is the very same, do therein
  deny the one to be a covenant of <hi>better</hi> promises then the other: for
  to say the promise of the law is the very same that the promise of the Gospel
  is; is to say that the one is <hi>as good</hi> as the other, and so to
  contradict that of <hi>Hab.</hi> 8. 6. which saies the Gospell Testament, and
  the promises thereof are <hi>better</hi> then the promises under the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:42067:83"/> And secondly if you say the
  <hi>Meliority</hi> that you hold to be in the Gospel co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant consists not in
  the <hi>Meliority</hi> of the promises of it above the other, but in the
  <hi>Meliority</hi> of the administration of it, the Gospel ordinances belonging
  not to the same only, but to more subjects, then the ordinances of the Law, in
  which respect we denying Gospel ordinances to infants, which were admitted to
  the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances under the Law, and so cutting of a <hi>Moity</hi> of the
  Christian world from the Church, which stood members of it before do streiten
  the Gospel, and make it worse and of less extent the Law.</p>
               <p>I answer first, That the <hi>Meliority</hi> of the Gospel
  covenant spoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. lies in the <hi>Meliority</hi> of the
  promises of it above the others, which <hi>Meliority</hi> we affirm but you
  deny, in saying the promises of both Covenants are one and the same, therefore
  it is your selves however, and not we that by your tenets make the Gospel
  Covenant at least no better than the Law, contrarily to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
  <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. and so your opinions and not ours are false and wicked by
  your own Argument.</p>
               <p>Bvt secondly if it be in very deed to make the Gospell covenant
  worse than the Laws (as you say it is) to hold infants no capable subjects of
  Gospel ordinances, some of which were capable subjects of the ordinances of the
  law,</p>
               <p>I shall first disprove your charge of us toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>her with your proof of it in that
  par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>Secondly prove that if notwithstanding all that I shall say
  toward the clearing of our selves, we must needs be held guilty of lessening
  the grace of God under the Gospel, in comparison of what it was under the law,
  because we deny the ordinances thereof to infants, to whom the ordinances of
  the law were dispensed, then you that judge us, condemn your selves also as
  being in the same kind guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the same, to this purpose lets see what you
  bring in proof of your <hi>Minor,</hi> in the last Syllogism; and how
  punctually it concludes to your present purpose, thus you argue.</p>

  misreport, and run from ore shooes, as the Proverb is, to ore boots too, for no

  and token in their flesh to mind them upon sight thereof, immediately of the
  Covenant that then was, remotely as a type (as every other thing under the law
  did) of something in the Gospel Covenant <hi>viz.</hi> circumcision of the
  heart, and that baptism it self is no seal at all, but a bare sign of the
  Gospel Covenant, and is not so much as a sign, or any thing else, but a meer
  nullity to little infants, yet the world is here belied into the belief of it,
  that I confesse both that circumcision was a seal of the Gospel Covenant, and
  that under such a notion as a seal of that Covenant <hi>Ishmael</hi> himself
  had right to it, and received it, for so you expresse it p. 7. and that baptism

  not to others onely, but even to infants by the name of seals of the Covenant
  of grace. As for circumcision that it was not so, though I might adde much more
  to what hath been before spoken in proof hereof in my animadversion of your

  understanding, what circumcision was, and was not, to a certain book, that is
  extant of one Mr. <hi>Iackson,</hi> once of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denden</hi> in
  <hi>Kent,</hi> stiled 19. <hi>Arguments, proving circumcision to be no seal of
  the Covenant of grace,</hi> whereunto is annexed the unlawfulnesse of Infant
  bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism upon that ground, of which book I must needs give testimony thus far
  to the world, that it being brought to me, whilst it was but a manuscript, and
  my self a <hi>Presbyter</hi> of your high places, in some confidence that I
  could answer it, how easily I might have shufled it off, had I set my self so
  to do I will not say, but I could not answer it solidly, nor <hi>salvâ
  consciencia,</hi> and therefore I let it alone for a time, till considering
  further of it, and of other things I was stirrd up to the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of by it, I
  was at last converted to the truth, whereupon as the best answer I was capable
  to give, I signed it in such wise (as I find <hi>Luther</hi> once signed
  ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther book in the like case) <hi>viz. memorandum</hi> that taking this book
  in hand at first to confute it, I was at last convinced by it.</p>
               <p>Which 19. proofs of circumcision to be no seal of the Covenant
  of Grace, if they be weak, and invalid, such a multitude as you are have time
  enough among you to disprove them, but if you yield to them, be silent and say
  no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>As for baptism I confesse it to be truly and properly a
  <hi>sign,</hi> and that of the Covenant of Grace, remission of sins by Christ
  his death and resurrection, which are both not onely signified, but also lively
  represented, and resembled in the true dispensation of it to believers, yet
  that it is so much as a sign at all to infants in infancy, or when grown to
  years either (if dispensed in infancy) I absolutely deny, and affirm that the
  very nature, use and office of it (as a sign to its subject) is totally
  destroyed by such immature administration: for a sign (specially
  <hi>propriè dictum)</hi> that is properly, and not improperly so called
  in reference to that person, whose sign it is, is some outward thing appearing
  to the senses, through which some other thing, some inward thing is at the same
  time apprehended by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, This is the most true and proper
  difinition that your <hi>Divines</hi> give of a sign in general, but in special
  of these signes, <hi>viz.</hi> baptism, and the supper, so <hi>Pareus</hi> and
  <hi>Kekerman</hi> both do define a sign out of <hi>Austin</hi>

  these signs <hi>viz. in oculis incurrentia signa,</hi> but such a thing baptism
  cannot be to infants in their infancy, nor after their infancy neither, if
  dispensed while <pb n="155" facs="tcp:42067:84"/> they are infants, the sign and thing

  as they must be <hi>viz.</hi> the sign by the senses, the thing signified by
  the understanding, and that at the same time when the sign appears to the
  senses, or else the sign is a meer <hi>Nullity,</hi> and of no use and benefit
  as a sign at all, for though infants may have the sense of the thing so as to
  see and feel if they were dipt in infancy, yet have they then no understanding
  of its meaning, and though when they come to years they are capable to gather
  the meaning of things, or from an appearing sign to conceive what is signified
  thereby, yet then the sign it self is fled out of sight, and so far out of the
  reach of their remembrance, that as thers nothing now presented, so neither
  ever was there any thing (for ought they can conjecture any more then by meer
  human hearsay) objected to their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at all: when the Jewes required a sign

               </p>
               <p>A sign then must be some <hi>memorandum,</hi> some object

  or sense of the sign, as from the then, or now present appearance of it, while
  the understanding of the party, whose sign it is, is lively acted on the thing,
  then to that person the sign (unlesse <hi>improperly,</hi> and improper signes

               <p>So then we see that according to your selves a sign is no sign
  at all to him, that is never seen all by him, who is to observe it, and that
  too at some time or other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he comes to observe what is meant by it,
  whereupon I testifie that what was done to us in infancy had it been the true
  sign of Christs own institution <hi>viz.</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism as twas rather a sign of
  meer mans institution <hi>viz.</hi> the sign Rantism, and the sign of the
  crosse, neither was nor is, nor ever will be any sign at all to you or me, if
  at any time it be a sign to vs it must be either while we are infants, or when
  grown to years, but not while infants, for then we apprehend not the thing
  signed, nor when at years, for then we apprehend not the sign. How mighty your
  memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and how exquisite your apprehensive powers are to bring these two, I
  mean the sign and thing signified together in your thoughts. I know not, but
  <hi>I</hi> plainly acknowledge (notwithstanding Dr <hi>Channels</hi> councel to
  the <hi>Auditory at the Dispute at Petworth Ian.</hi> 5. 1651 to remember, and
  call to mind what was signified to them in their infant baptism) that as in
  infancy I perceived not to what purpose I was signed, so now (save what I have
  by hearsay) I perceive not, nor ever did of my self to my best remembrance that
  I was then so signed at all. As for that true baptism, which I have since
  submitted to some 4 or 5 years ago, as it then <pb n="156" facs="tcp:42067:85"/> preached
  (so far as a sign may be said to preach) most precious things to my
  un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, so it lively appeared to my senses, and left such impression
  upon then and such an <hi>Idea</hi> thereof in my mind, that me thinks I both
  see and remember it still, and so shall I hope have good cause to do whilest I
  live. I conclude then that to signifie things to infants by baptism in infancy
  is a meer blank, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nullity, a silly cypher, that stands for nothing
  and is of no use to them at all.</p>
               <p>Yea as it would be thought no better then meer mockery, or

  and firmly as <hi>by seal,</hi> he preaches it himself alone, and though by a
  <hi>baptism,</hi> yet a better baptism then that of water, that is the <hi>holy
  spirit,</hi> which (though the sign may be set, first, to profest believers
  that are not so indeed, secondly, and this very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly and openly to the view
  of others, thirdly by men like our selves) yet first is never set to any but
  believers in truth, secondly, and that secretly and indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to any but
  themselves that are seald, thirdly, by none but God himself, who onely sets
  <hi>that baptism</hi> close to the conscience within, <hi>which baptism</hi> no
  man under heaven can administer: what we set i. e. the sign may very easily be
  to a blank, our ministration being liable to mistake, but what Christ sets i.
  e. <hi>the <pb n="159" facs="tcp:42067:86"/> seal</hi> that makes us most sure from
  himself, that cannot possibly be misplaced, for where and whensoever the spirit
  of God within is sent to bear witnesse, and cry <hi>Abba,</hi> i. e. father,
  there and then God is a father indeed: your own selves say that where the seal
  is, that soul is sure at that time, a real heir, and from that time forth say
  you also for ever, and so say I, if that soul continue for ever, cleaving to
  the Lord, not quenching, resisting, or so grieving that holy spirit, as to
  cause it to depart for ever (for if so thers another tale told you from several
  Scriptures, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10
  29.)</p>
               <p>But if it be so as you say, that Gods <hi>seal</hi> seals up
  none but such as are both true heirs by faith at present, and must necessarily
  abide so for ever, then first here's an Argument <hi>(ad hominem)</hi> how
  ever, i. e. an evidence to you out of your own mouthes, that your baptism is
  none of Gods seal, sith it is set by you not onely to 1000s that after it fall
  from him, but indeed to 1000s that never knew him their father, nor never will.
  I again therefore once more for all (that I may not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my self with them,
  when I meet them in other places) protest against these your expressions of
  circumcision and baptism by the name of <hi>seals, Gods seales</hi> of the
  Gospel Covenant &amp;c. first as none of mine, wheresoever you are found
  fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering them on me, as p. 6. 7. 14. Secondly as none of Gods expressions,
  though (I know not how many times ore <hi>viz.</hi> p. 4. 6. 7. 8. 13. 14.) you
  aver the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to be Gods seals, and father that very phrase on God
  himself, who as he useth not such a phrase, when he speaks of those <hi>foolish
  things</hi> (as the world counts them 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.) which he chuses as
  his outward witnesses, shews, signs and love tokens from himself to us, so he
  useth no such tools indeed as these Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal signes are, when he
  ministreth himself, for these he appoints men to minister in; these are the
  instruments of the foolish sheapherds <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 15. even the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
  instruments which God hath chosen for the under sheapheards to act by, he uses
  none of these I say as his own seal and inward witnesse, for thats no lesse
  then the holy spirit, which whattypes, shews and signes of the Gospel Covenant
  soever there have bin outwardly both before and since the Gospel begun, hath
  bin, is and ever shall be the onely earnest that God hath given, the only
  witnesse that him self hath us'd, the onely <hi>seal</hi> that he hath set in
  any age, whether before the law, or under the law, or under the Gospel,
  <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 11. 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. 4. 30. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5.
  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. 23.</p>
               <p>So having removed the rubbish of rude expression, with which
  your last argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was clouded, and not a little over loaded (as you delivered
  it) I come now to consider it nakedly as it lies substantially enough compriz'd
  in these expressions <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Under the law circumcision was by Gods appointment dispensed
  to little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, Ergo under the Gospel baptism must be to infants also, or
  else the Gospel Covenant is worse to the spiritual seed of</hi> Abraham
  <hi>now, then it was to his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall seed under the law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is in short the plain sense and ordinary way of urging this
  argument.</p>
               <p>By way of Answer to which let me be so bold first as to ask you
  this one questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>viz.</hi> why you stand so stifly to have baptism
  dispens'd so strictly after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of circumcision, and yet stray and vary
  your very selves from the fashion of that administration in a manner as much as
  any men in the world? for verily though the way of circumcision be that you
  stickle for, yet you stragle from it, and as to the very subject it self, vary
  from it as much as in any thing else; if that be the rule after which men must
  baptize (as you plead) why then do ye not baptize (for so they circumcised)</p>
               <p>First onely males, and no females?</p>
               <p>Secondly all male servants upon the masters single faith, as
  well as male cchil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren on the fathers?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, on the eighth day onely, and neither sooner nor later,
  nor one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it nor behind it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:42067:87"/> Fourthly, by the hands of parents,
  fathers, Mrs. Mothers, as well as by the hands of the Priests onely?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, any where <hi>viz:</hi> at home or abroad, in Inns or
  other places, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is, but onely or for the most part in your great
  <hi>stone houses?</hi> for this is both the liberty and the bondage of your
  late directory, that <hi>baptism must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd by a Minister onely, not in
  any case by a private person, much lesse by a mother, or any woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, in the places of publique worship onely, not in
  private places or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, on any day, not specifying he eighth, so it be not
  unnecessarily delayed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to any child whether male or female for ought you
  expresse to the contrary, if so be the parent be a believer.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, to no man servant so far as I find on the masters
  belief, though a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian may chance to hire into his house an
  <hi>Indian</hi> or infidel: when as its most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously known that thus it
  was then <hi>viz.</hi> that not the publique Priests onely in the publique
  places, but masters might and must circumcise all their male servants, fathers
  or mothers their male infants, on the eighth day onely, and that either at home
  (as <hi>Abraham</hi> in his house <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.) or any where else (as
  <hi>Zipporah</hi> at an Inn <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 24. 25. 26.)</p>
               <p>O the prodigious proling that you Priests make from your own
  pattern! how crookedly close do you keep to your own coppy? there are about
  some seven seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral modifications of actions, in respect of which one may be
  said to differ from, or be like another, which for memories sake are coucht
  altogether in this verse of interrogatories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quis? quid? ubi? qualis? quando? quibus auxiliis?
  cur?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all which if inquisition be made, how far forth your baptism
  and circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do agree or differ, though you contend or rather pretend them
  to be like one another in each, yet we shall find a deep disparity between them
  in no lesse then all.</p>
               <p>First, if we ask (as <hi>de subjecto)</hi> this question
  <hi>quis?</hi> who is the true subject of <hi>circumcision,</hi> who of your
  <hi>baptism,</hi> yea even your own so <hi>circumcision-like</hi> baptism (much
  more that baptism which is rightly dispensed) how far is the one divers from
  the other? though this is one of the main things wherein you profess they must
  be alike, for that (as I shew'd before) did belong to males onely, this you
  dispense to females also; that to the natural infants of the Jews though the
  parents were known to be unbelievers (for <hi>Ioshua</hi> circumcised the seed
  of all those murmurers that were cut off for unbelief) this (as to no natural
  infants at all by right, no not to the Jews infants) so by your own confession,
  not to any infants whose parents are unbelievers, whereby you may see that as
  the law is changed, so there is a plain change also in the subjects of these
  two ordinances <hi>circumcision and baptism</hi> not onely as we, but as you
  your selves contend to have baptism dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed, for as onely so all the male
  children of the Jews both might and must be circumcised though their parents
  were never such wicked unbelievers, but even your selves say the Jews seed are
  all cut off from baptism and the Gospel Church, because their parents are un
  believers; both all the Jews and their males might be circumcised though none
  of them believed, while that Covenant of circumcision stood, meerly as they
  were of the stock of believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> but might not be baptized when
  the Gospel Covenant began in <hi>Iohns Baptism</hi> upon that account, unlesse
  they now believed in their own persons though they were of the stock of
  <hi>Abraham</hi> still as much as ever, nor may to this day in your own
  opinions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if (as to the nature, matter and essential form or
  being of the <hi>Rites</hi> themselves) we ask the question <hi>quid?</hi> what
  circumcision was, and what your baptism? how far do they differ? the one being
  a cutting off the foreskin of the flesh, the other a wetting of the foreskin of
  the face onely with a few drops of water, no more like it then chalke's like
  cheese.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:42067:87"/> Thirdly if, as to the place where, we ask
  the question <hi>ubi?</hi> where circumcision was dispensed, and where your
  selves say baptism ought to be? how greatly doth your manner of baptism differ
  from it? and how much more then ours? for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision might be dispensed any
  where but in the Temple, where I find not they were to be brought at all till
  circumcised, as <hi>Christ himself Luke</hi> 2. 21, 22. but your
  <hi>Rantism</hi> no where else by appointment but in your <hi>Temples;</hi>
  herein I say our baptism squares more with it than yours, who pretend so much
  to baptize after the manner of it, for all places are to us alike, where there
  is conveniency of water enough to baptize in, and therefore we must except the
  Font and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if, as to the quality, special properties, uses, ends
  and offices of these two dispensations, the question be asked <hi>in quale
  quid?</hi> what were the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial properties, purposes, uses, ends, and offices
  of these two several administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? what things persons were specially
  obliged to by them? what was speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally signified to persons in them? and such
  like how little do these look each like the other? for circumcision tied men to
  the observation of a certain carnal, cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome, costly service, Law,
  Priest-hood, in order to their inheriting the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canaan,</hi> which
  all are now clean changed and confiscate, but baptism, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed by us
  according to the word, binds to the observation of another <hi>Law,</hi> and
  the voice of another <hi>Law giver,</hi> High Priest, and Prophet <hi>Christ
  Iesus,</hi> whom <hi>Moses</hi> spake of, and God hath now raised up
  accordingly, and this in order to a future enjoiment of a heavenly inheritance
  typed out by the other; and as for your rantism it ties to neither this nor
  that, but to a certain service, and law of Ordinances, and Gospel, and Church
  posture, and priesthood of mans own making, which one knows not well what to
  make of, nor what part of speech to call it but a <hi>participle,</hi> for it
  takes part of the Law and part of the Gospel, and is neither perfectly, but
  patcht up out of both by the politick power of the Priesthood, so as it may
  make most for the peoples painted pietie, and their own pay together, in order
  to their labor for their pains <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 9.</p>
               <p>Again, Circumcision pointed as a type indeed at the circumcision
  of the heart but as a sign so it signified a promise of outward felicity in
  <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that <hi>Christ</hi> should come of <hi>Abraham</hi> after
  the flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> true baptism signifies the death, burial, and
  resurrection of Christ, and remission of sins by his being crucified, and such
  things as were no wayes resembled by the other, <hi>your</hi> rantism just
  no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, if as to the time of those two services, the question be
  askt <hi>Quando?</hi> when circumcision, and when your baptism are by right to
  be dispensed? how miserably do you your selves misse of hitting right with it
  here too? though it be a main matter you intimate to us your imitation of
  circumcision in, circumcision being punctually to be performed on the eighth
  day, true baptism not till the day wherein persons appear to believe withall
  their heart, and so not in any infancy at all but the infancy of our faith, and
  even your rantism, though in infancy, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was, yet on what day you
  please besides the 8th, sometimes after a fourt'night, or a moneth, and
  sometimes at the half year or years end.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if, as to the administrator, it be ask <hi>quibus
  auxiliis?</hi> by whose hands these ordinances are to be administred? how
  different are they? circumcision being dispensed by the Master, Father, or
  mother, but as for baptism (as you dispense it at least) none but men in holy
  orders are to administer it, in which you go not only besides the Gospel which
  records <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing baptism, who were but
  gifted disciples, and neither of them in any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the ministery, save
  that <hi>Philip</hi> was in office as a <hi>Deacon</hi> to look to the poor, by
  vertue of which <hi>Deaconship</hi> if you <hi>Presbyters</hi> judge (as the
  Bishops did before you) that <hi>Philip</hi> baptized, and not rather by his
  <hi>Discipleship,</hi> I deem you will dote at last as much as they; but also
  besides the Law you live by.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:42067:88"/> Seventhly, if (as to the account and
  warrant) it be demanded <hi>Cur?</hi> why they circumcised infants, and why you
  baptize them? how far do you fall short of the Jewes in this also? for they had
  express precept, and institution to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise infants over and over again
  repeated in <hi>Moses</hi> Testament, besides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> own family the self same day wherein the command was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
  to circumcise all the males at eight daies old, whereas if that which we call
  the New Testament, be indeed the Register of <hi>Christs</hi> will there is, as
  is confess by the most ingenuous of your coat, witness Mr. <hi>Hunton</hi> at a
  publike dispute at <hi>Warbleton</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> neither one plain
  precept, nor so much as one president of such a matter as baptizing infants:
  God never appointed such a thing, neither, to speak in that figure in which God
  speaks of himself <hi>Ier.</hi> 19. 5. came it at all into his mind.</p>
               <p>So like are circumcision, your rule for baptism, and your
  baptism which yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> profess to act
  in by that rule of circumcision, that to say the truth your run ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> from your rule in every line you
  write after it, so that I much wonder that you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all men should argue
  baptism comes in the room of circumcision, so that they are both as one, and
  the one must be ordered after the example of the other, who in your baptism
  come no nearer circumcision then so. For verily they meet one another very
  little nearer then in that general denomination of a sign or <hi>token of a
  Covenant,</hi> in which the <hi>Rainbow</hi> may be said to be like them both.
  That two things should be one thing, for so with you your Rantism and
  circumcision are, and yet be adequate well-nigh in nothing is <hi>riddle me
  whats this</hi> with a witness.</p>
               <p>And by all this we may see how forcible your Argument is that is
  drawn from the <hi>Analogy</hi> of baptism with circumcision, which Argument
  your Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> saies <hi>may be truly called, in regard of the
  Anabaptists,</hi> Pons Asinorum, <hi>a bridge which these asses could never
  pass over, for to this day they could never, nor,</hi> quoth he, <hi>hereafter
  will be ever able to yield a reason, why the children of the faithful under the
  Gospel are not as capable of baptism, as they under the law of
  cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi> p. 40. but by your leave, through whom that Doctor being
  dead yet speaketh, the <hi>Dialogy</hi> and discrepation that is between, not
  only your <hi>Rantism,</hi> as is above mentioned, but also the
  <hi>true-baptism</hi> and <hi>circumcision,</hi> is such a reason to the
  contrary, as all the <hi>Classes</hi> of <hi>Clergy</hi> men combind together
  in one <hi>Synodicall Convention,</hi> will never be able clearly to refute as
  long as they breath.</p>
               <p>As therefore to the Argument of <hi>yours</hi> which I am now in
  hand with, I come now directly to denie the consequence thereof, for it follows
  not in any wise that because circumcision was <hi>by</hi> Gods appointment
  dispensed to little infants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptism must be so now, and that not
  only for those manie reasons above spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, but even for this also, because
  God did appoint that circumcision should be dispensed to infants under the Law;
  but did never appoint anie such thing as that baptism should be dispensed to
  infants under the Gospel, nor is there the least tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in all the Testament
  of Christ tending to the manifestation of one crumb of commission for that
  matter.</p>

                  <hi>Marshall</hi> reasons in his answer to
  <hi>Mr. Tombes</hi> p. 214. by way of repetition of what he more largely
  delivered in his Sermon, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In every nation the children make a great part of that
  Nation, and they are alwaies included under every administration, whether
  promises, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, priviledges, or burdens, mercies, or judgements,
  unless they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much after the same sort also doth Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> express
  himself, p. 20. of his birth priviledge concerning <hi>Mat. 28. 19.
  viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The words there comprize infants, they are no more excluded
  then men at years, serving to make up a Nation as well as parents, the infants
  of any nation make a part of the nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But who would think such goodly geer as this should manifest it
  self to the whole world, as a fruit of the most serious meditations of men so
  eminently <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemical</hi> as they by the <hi>Clergy</hi> are esteemed to be
  in their several Tracts in this point, and that it should pass without the
  least <hi>item</hi> of correction for it, from any one of their brethren, who
  rather seem all to consent to, then contradict them? However I shall make as
  serious Examen of it as I can.</p>
               <p>First, then is it so <hi>Sirs,</hi> that what ever
  administration extends to all nations belongs to infants therein, as well as
  men, so that they are no more excluded, from it, then men at years? how is it
  then that preaching the Gospel, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with laying on of hands for
  confirmation, for the spirit, which D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Holmes</hi> dotes was dispensed to
  these infants that were brought to Christ, and therfore much more baptism in
  infancy, and as a proof thereof brings testimony that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver used in the
  primitive times to be dispensed till past infancy; how is it (I say) that
  these, and also fellowship in the supper are by your very selves denyed to
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to infants in infancy? what is the reason that you exclude infants
  here? are not these priviledges belonging to men, why then (if yours and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  <hi>Marshalls</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion <pb n="164" facs="tcp:42067:89"/> be true) not to infants as
  well as men? are they not mercies, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, merciful administrations
  of God, extended to all nations? yea is not preaching an administration to
  every creature that extends not to infants? and yet (saving <hi>Mr
  Marshals</hi> cunning insertion of this clause <hi>(unlesse they be
  excepted)</hi> whereby to salve his proposition, from default of falsity,
  though thereby he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it plainly uslesse to his purpose) are infants any
  where by name excepted from any one of these administrations, any more then
  they are from baptism it self? yea is it not an administration of God extending
  to all nations that persons should work, or else not eat, in which infants are
  not included, for then must they starve, and yet no where at all excepted? yea
  <hi>he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, he that believeth not
  shall be damned; Christ is the Author of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall salvation to all them that
  obey him; Christ shall com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  infants are not excepted? and yet do these include and comprize infants as much
  as men at years? or are infants excluded by expresse exception from any of
  these, any more then from that one amongst the rest <hi>viz.</hi> the duty and

  that every admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration that extendeth to all nations, belongeth to infants
  as well as men? yea (that I may shame and silence you in this out of your own
  sayings) some of you, namely Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> perceiving that if you grant
  that Infants did eat the passeover it will follow from that to their eating the
  supper, as well as from their circumcision of old to the baptism of them now,
  do assert that infants did not eat the passeover, yet was not the passeover an
  administration to the nation of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>srael,</hi> from which infants were never
  excepted? and if so, how then can your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sayings be true, that every
  administration that extendeth to the nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to infants as well as to
  persons at years, unlesse they be somewhere excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>We mean not of a formall exception, but a vertuall
  exception, an exception in effect at least infants must have, or else be
  supposed as included under every administration that is given to the nations,
  and thus infants are excepted from all those last mentioned precepts, promises,
  threats &amp;c. forasmuch as it is most notoriously known they are not capable
  to do the things upon the performance, or non-performance of which those
  mercies and Iudgements are promised and threatned, for they cannot hear Christs
  voice, nor know, nor love, nor obey him, nor deny themselves, nor hate their
  lives, nor confesse him, nor deny him, and whereas tis said that if any will
  not work let him not eat, infants must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be understood to be
  excepted there, though not by name, because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work, and so (unlesse
  excepted) must perish by Gods appointment for want of food; so concerning
  eating at the supper, Infants are excepted, not expressely, yet implicitly, and
  in effect in those words, let a man examine himself, and so let him eat,
  because theres that required in order to eating there viz. self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination,
  discerning the Lords body and blood which infants cannot do.</hi>

               <p>Tis very true, they are excepted from all these as <hi>you say
  implicitly,</hi> and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffect, though not expressely, but then (let it be
  considered) is there not as fair, and as clear an exception of them from
  baptism, as from any of these, or in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular as from that service of the
  supper? in as much as theres that required in order to baptisme which infants
  can no more do, then they can do whats requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the supper? <hi>viz.</hi>

  this question, what hinders why I <hi>may</hi> not eat the supper? you would

  why I may not be baptized? he answers him in the very same <hi>viz.</hi> if

               <p>So you use to say still indeed of these Scriptures, that they
  speak of persons at age and not in non-age, and so say I too, but I wonder then
  where are the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that speak of infants baptism? if all the places of
  Scripture that speak of baptism at all, speak onely of the baptism of adult
  ones (and so you are fain to confesse they do when we come to examine them one
  after another, yea I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that at two publique disputes, when we have put
  you to assign what Scripture infant baptism is commanded in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
  19. hath bin nominated as your war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, out of which when it hath been plainly
  proved that Christ commands no more in that place to be baptized, then such
  whom he commands also first to be instructed, reply hath been made to this
  purpose <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ there requires that such as are capable of
  instruction should be instructed first, but that hinders not why infants may
  not be baptized before instruction) but if so I say I wonder still where that
  place is that warrants it that infants may be baptized at all, si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>h you are fain to confesse that that
  phrase <hi>go teach and baptize,</hi> yea even you your selves sometimes, who
  just before assigned it as the warrant for infant baptism, that it speaks onely
  of persons capable to be taught, and not of infants.</p>
               <p>As you say therefore that these places speak of the baptism of
  men and women <pb n="166" facs="tcp:42067:90"/> onely that are capable to learn, believe
  and repent, and not <hi>exclusivly</hi> of infants, because they are not
  capable to do those things, who yet may be bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ized for all that, so I say of these words, <hi>let a man examine
  himself, and so let him eat,</hi> they imply an unlawfulnesse in men and women
  only to eat the supper without self-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, but not in infants, who being
  not capable to examine themselves, may (any thing to the contrary there
  notwithstanding) be admitted to the supper with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: tis men and women
  onely, and not children who upon non-examination of themselves are
  excepted.</p>
               <p>As you argue therefore that every administration to an Nation
  includes infants, as well as men, unlesse the be excepted, and therefore they
  must be baptized: I conclude the same from those premises, concerning their
  right to other ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>viz.</hi> therefore they must be preacht to,
  therefore they must eat the supper, two administrations given to all nations,
  from which infants are no more excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then from baptism. As therefore you
  take it for an implicit exception of infants from the supper, in that they
  cannot perform what is required in that place to the receiving of it, i. e. not
  examine themselves, nor discern the Lords body, though by name they are not
  excepted, so (if you be not partial) your own consciences will compel you to
  take it for at least as implicit an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of infants from baptism, in that
  they are no way capable to perform those things which are required of persons
  in order to their admission to baptism in other places <hi>viz.</hi> nor to
  believe with all tbe heart, nor to confesse
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>in, nor amend their lives, nor
  repent, nor call on the name of the Lord, all which were required of adult ones
  that come to baptism, as we see <hi>Mat. 3. Act. 2. Act. 8. Act.</hi> 22. and
  also in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> where it being askt what is required of persons to
  be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? answer is made thus, <hi>viz. repentance whereby they forsake
  sin: and faith whereby they stedfastly believe the promises of God made to them
  in that sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> though by name they be not excepted in any of these
  places.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>cui signatum ei signum nisi obstet</hi> &amp;c. your
  thredbare Argument <hi>viz.</hi> to whom the thing signified belongs to them
  the sign, unlesse there be some impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment or in capacity to perform what is
  required in order to the receiving of the sign, if it had one farthing worth of
  force in it to give infants accesse to baptism, would equally avail to give
  them accesse to the supper, if we were minded in good earnest to plead their
  right to both, in evidence of which I shall argue upon you with your own
  Argument, thus</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To whom the thing signified belongs, to them the sign also
  belongs, unlesse there be some exception or incapacity to perform what is
  required to the receiving of the sign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the thing signified in the supper which is the same
  thats signified in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism viz. Christ and his benefits belongs to infants,
  and theres no more excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them from it, them from baptism, nor more
  incapacity in them to perform that which is required to the supper, then there
  is in them to perform whats re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo <hi>if they may receive the outward sign of baptism, they
  may receive the outward sign of the supper also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in truth as they are no more capable of one of these signs
  then the other, so are they in very dead both uncapable of, and plainly enough
  alike excepted from both.</p>
               <p>Secondly, is it so <hi>Sirs,</hi> that infants being a great
  part (if not the Major part) of all nations must therefore be baptized, because
  its said baptize all Nations, unless they had been excepted, then I answer
  again, if you mean thus, <hi>viz</hi> unless they had been some way or other
  (at least vertually or implicitly excepted) then infants are most manifestly
  and clearly excepted in this very text it self, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. if there
  were no other in all the Scripture to exclude them: for first though that be
  Christs commission and direction to his disciples whom to baptize, yet theres
  no mention</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:42067:90"/> at all of children, nor yet in

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s, concerning the baptism of
  such as are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the faith by preaching, and this D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Featley</hi>
  himself more then confesses, for he urges it with earnestness p. 62. in these
  words, <hi>viz. there is no mention of children in either of these texts,</hi>
  and if so that theres no mention at all then they are not implied, as both Mr.
  <hi>Marshal</hi> and himself (to the contradiction of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) affirms they
  are in the word <hi>Nations,</hi> for for children to be both implied, and
  included in that word <hi>Nations,</hi> and yet neither to be mentioned, nor
  meant therein at all, are inconsistent, and such a bo-peep as is impossible,
  and if they be not so much as implied, and mentioned in the commission they
  must needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be excepted and excluded.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as there is no mention of children, so there is such a
  plain limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and restriction of baptism to such persons, as infants in
  infancy are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be <hi>viz.</hi> Disciples of Christ,
  <hi>aliâs</hi> persons so taught and instructed by the ministration of

  the other, <hi>viz.</hi> of being taught just before baptism and presently

               <p>This therefore that all Nations are bid to be baptized, cannot
  make <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. to be a precept for baptizing infants, though they
  be of the Nations, unlesse they were capable to be taught, which because they

               <p>A second way wherein tis argued by you that theres command in
  <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. for the baptizing of infants, is from their being
  disciples, which weak twig, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your selves as it were sinking in your

  or other of your writings I find your fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your selves in that foolish

  Mr. Marshal, Mr. Bayly, Mr. Blake, Mr. Baxter, Mr. Cook, Mr. Cotton,</hi> among
  all which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> being the most formal and <hi>Syllogistical</hi>

  in this place before I have done) Ile begin with him and in him, and after him,
  speak to you all sooner or later (as occasion is) about this particular.</p>
               <p>Thus then he reasons from thence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such as be disciples they are to be baptized..</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo the children of the faithfull are to be
  baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The former proposition is clearly exprest in the text (saith
  he) make disciples and baptize them, therefore all disciples are to be
  baptized,</hi> but had he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded according to mood and figure, or the tenor
  of this text, or had he not been both blinded, and minded to go besides the
  sense of the spirit in this place, he would have said therefore all that are
  first made disciples by instruction are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and then he had mard
  all his proceedings concerning infants.</p>
               <p>As for the second proposition which is the assertion of you all
  <hi>viz.</hi> That infants are disciples, <hi>Mr. Cotton</hi> toward the proof
  of it so miserably misapplies 2. pieces of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> that he rather
  proves himself thereby to be yet but an infant in discipleship, and Gospel
  understanding then proves infants to be disciples from thence.</p>
               <p>The first place is <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 13. whereby its said, by
  way of promise to the Church of the <hi>New Ierusa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  ever from all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture sufferings, and oppressions, <hi>That all her children
  shall be taught of God, and great shall be the peace of her children:</hi> from
  this place, which is meant of all the Saints, and that immediate teaching which
  they shall once have, he argues thus, to all the naturall infants of believing
  parents in the Church now, viz. <hi>if they be taught of God, then are they
  disciples, for that is the meaning of the word disciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Disciples are taught or learned of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His second place is <hi>Isay.</hi> 65. 20. where its said
  <hi>there shall be no more thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth an infant of daies &amp;c.</hi> in

  were well awake, or asleep when he set it down, concerning it Ile propound four
  things to be well examined of you all,</p>
               <p>First whether he be not egregiously mist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>en in the persons to whom those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are made,
  which if they be all infants of the faithful, considered as in their minority,
  then is there a mighty mist before my eyes, for really by the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> improvement I can make of my
  understanding, I can possibly ken no such matter, nor that it is any other then
  the Saints, and faithful ones themselves; even all of them, and not any of
  their children after the flesh, but as they prove faithfull, and do
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ome Saints in their own persons
  as well as their parents.</p>
               <p>Secondly whether he be not grossely mistaken about the time
  wherein these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are to be fulfilled, in fuller evidence of both which
  consider, first as to the first Scripture, who ever they are that are there
  expressed by the term <hi>[thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren]</hi> they are all and every of them
  without exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> partakers of the Lords teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of all the other
  priviledges there promised, for its said, <hi>All thy children shall be taught
  of the Lord &amp;c.</hi> at that time therefore wherein this shall be
  ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled this promise shall be performed to every individual of those kind of
  persons, to whom its made, not one excepted, which shews that it is meant onely
  of the Saints, for they are the Churches children, and not their natural seed,
  and of that time onely when the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> which is not yet, shall
  come down from God out of heaven, for so shall it then be with all the faithful
  that shall inhabit that City of the Lord, whose people are said also to be all
  righteous, <hi>Is.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>0. 21.
  but this is not performed to all the children of the faithfull now, neither are
  they all taught of God, with that effectual teaching there promised, as is
  evident, in that many of them in time prove reprobates, when wicked mens
  children prove e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:42067:92"/> Secondly, It is expresly shewed in the 17
  v. who are the persons whose porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and heritage these priviledges are, for
  this (saith he) is the heritage of the servants of the Lord.</p>
               <p>As for the second place, so far is it from speaking of infants
  in infancy, that it rather shewes that there shall be no infant of daies,
  <hi>i. e.</hi> that shall dy an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, nor old man that hath not filled his
  daies in that time, but the very child shall dy an hundred years old, i. e. he
  shall be counted as dying young, or a child that lives but an hundred years, so
  long lived shall they be in those daies, yea <hi>as the daies of a tree shall
  be the daies of my people</hi> (saith God) <hi>and mine elect shall long enjoy
  the works of their hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the time when these things shall be, tis not now, but
  in the reign of Christ, when the <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> shall be built with
  <hi>Saphirs,</hi> and all precious stones, and when the Lord shall make the
  <hi>New Heavens</hi> and the <hi>New Earth,</hi> which is not yet in being, but
  is looked for of all the Saints at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ, and the redemption
  of Israel (as <hi>Peter saith)</hi> according to his promise, which appears
  plainly by comparing <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 17—66. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13, 14. and also by the last
  text of the two, which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> abuses, <hi>viz. Isa.</hi> 65. v. 20
  which saith this shall be from <hi>thenceforth; i. e.</hi> from the time of
  Gods creating that new heavens and new earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether he doth not most palpably depart from the
  matter he took first in hand to prove unto another thing, which is no more to
  his purpose, then if he had said <hi>bo</hi> to a goose; yea he runs clear away
  from the Scripture he began upon and never returns to it more, as if he were
  affraid to come near it, scarce ere so much as facing about, or looking behind
  him: for what he ought to have clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (but surely he thought he could not,
  and therefore was not minded to meddle with it) was this, <hi>viz.</hi> that in
  order to being the subjects of the baptism there injoined infants are
  disciples, in such a sense as is there spoken of <hi>viz.</hi> made so by the
  Ministery of the word, and teaching; for saith <hi>Christ</hi> go teach all
  nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons baptizing them, but his is not to the same, not <hi>ad idem,</hi> but
  <hi>ad aliud quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> a certain other thing, which if he did prove (as he
  doth not) it could in no wise prove what he brings it in proof of,
  <hi>viz.</hi> that infants of the faithful, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of some uncouth,
  unheard of, strange, secret sort of teaching and learning, which these infants
  have from God above any other, may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to be disciples, and
  thereupon to be baptized.</p>
               <p>And this though it be not spoken so broadly by any as by Mr.
  <hi>Cotton,</hi> who makes it his business so far as to wrest and pervert
  certain Scriptures into the proof of it, insomuch that some of his fellow
  fighters for infant-baptism are ashamed on't and disclaim it, (witness Mr.
  <hi>Bayly</hi> p. 145. where, speaking of infants being disciples, <hi>I speak
  not</hi> (saith he) <hi>of that which divers maintain,</hi> viz. <hi>the
  appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that in Esay to infants, they shall be all taught of God)</hi>
  yet is it more ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly hinted to be the opinion of most of you, whereupon you
  attribute both dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipleship, and baptism to infants, as if that were the main
  thing meant in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. where Christ means no such matter as the
  inward secret and unknown teachings of God, but the teachings or making

               <p>Fiftly, Let it be examined, whether the words of Mr.

  meaning of that word <hi>[Disciple]</hi> about which several of you not a
  little also contradict your selves, about which therefore either he, or you
  must be mistaken: for he confesses the true meaning of the word
  <hi>[Disciple]</hi> is <hi>taught,</hi> or <hi>learned,</hi> and Disciples are
  such as are taught and have learned: but several of you say that
  <hi>Discipling</hi> is not <hi>teaching,</hi> and <hi>breeding Schollars,</hi>
  or making them learned, nor to be discipled, to be taught, or learned, but that
  <hi>baptizing</hi> may well be rendered a <hi>discipling,</hi> and to make

  is but a meer silly mouse, for <hi>this is</hi> the conclusion of that whole

  his infants with it in infancy, so teacheth and reacheth us now by Analogy and

  without respect to any reviving thereof in any part of the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
  <hi>may serve our turnes as a sufficient command, that doth vertually bind us
  to baptize our infants now:</hi> to which absurdity, though many a wise man
  would afford no other answer then a laugh in his sleeve, yet as very a fool
  <hi>as</hi> I <pb n="179" facs="tcp:42067:96"/> am, I shall onely soberly reply to it as
  follweth.</p>
               <p>First, is it so that the command to circumcise infants is
  vertually a command to us to baptize them? then <hi>Sirs</hi> why do you not

  to this purpose <hi>viz.</hi> that if it were not forbidden then it might be

               <p>And least all this should be of as little weight with others, as
  it was with him, I shall adde a little by way of proof, that theres prohibition
  enough of infants bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, in case it be not clearly commanded, For</p>
               <p>First, what is not commanded of God is but tradition of man, for
  which men shall have no thank for their labour <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, neither are we altogether without such positive
  prohibition, as may be sufficient to satisfie you at least, who hold the
  command for circumcision of infants to be a command for the baptizing of them:
  in order to your understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, I shall refer you to <hi>Act.</hi>
  21. 21. where its said of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he <hi>taught all the Iews, which
  were among the Gentiles, to forsake Moses, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they ought not to
  circumcise their children, nor to walk after the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.</hi> In which
  Scripture I beseech you in the fear of God to observe how tis rehearsed that
  three things were most expressely forbdiden, as unlawful for the <hi>Iews</hi>
  themselves, much more to any believing Gentiles under the dayes of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
  by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching.</p>
               <p>First, they were forbidden (in general) <hi>to follow
  Moses,</hi> i. e. to live after his law and testament any longer, they are
  charg'd <hi>to forsake Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly (in particular) they were forbidden <hi>to circumcise
  their children,</hi> that being indeed a business the Jews still so doted on,
  that of all things they were unwilling to let it go, which by the way, shews us
  plainly, that there was nothing injoyned to be done to infants in the room of
  it, as some (but simply) conceive baptism was by <hi>Peter Act.</hi> 2. in
  order to their comfort, under the losse of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for if there had, then
  surely it would have been specified, and <hi>Paul</hi> would have preached thus
  to the Jews, the more easily to weane them from that antient custome of
  circumcising their children (specially considering how loath they were to part
  with it) <hi>viz.</hi> you ought not to <hi>circumcise</hi> your children now,
  but instead thereof to <hi>baptize</hi> them, and this may well serve in liew
  of, and satisfie you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der losse of the other, as being not so painful a
  service, but an easier sign, and that of better things then those promised in
  the Covenant of circumcision: but he saies no such matter, if he had there
  would have been doubtlesse less ado, then it should seem there was, to bring
  the <hi>Iews</hi> off from that practise of circumcising their infants, of
  which even after they believed they were so zealous, as not to hear of the
  abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of it without offence, for this would surely easily have contented
  and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them, if they might have had their children baptized, as of old
  they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, but this doubtlesse made them so difficult to be
  perswaded to a forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of circumcising there infants, because they saw the
  gospel had no answerable dispensation belonging to their infants in the place
  of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in general again, they were forbidden to walk so much
  as after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <pb n="183" facs="tcp:42067:98"/> of <hi>Moses,</hi> for the word here
  rendred customs is [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] the same that is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the
  singular number. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 1. [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] which is there
  rendred after the manner of <hi>Moses,</hi> which word <hi>[after the
  customes]</hi> or <hi>[after the manner of Moses,</hi> prohibits not onely all
  observation of those ordinances of the law it self, but also all walking after
  the same fashion, way and manner as the ordinances of the law were administred
  in, heres not only an injunction of non-conformity to the law it self, but
  prohibition of all conformity to the manner of it: they are not onely taught
  not to do the same things that were done under <hi>Moses,</hi> but also not to
  do under the Gospel in the same way and fashion as of old: they are not onely
  bid not to circumcise children, but also not to walk after the manner of
  circumcision or after the customes of the law; and therefore consequently not
  to baptize children now, which practise you of the Priesthood not onely
  confesse to be agreeable, and conformable to that custom of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
  children under the law, but also contend with all your might to
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ave them baptized now, upon no
  other account mainly then this, upon which <hi>Paul</hi> plain ly seems to
  forbid it: for you say twas the custom and manner of old to circumcise
  children, therefore though circumcision it self be ceased, and baptism come in
  the room of it, yet thus far at least we must follow the fashion of the Church
  of the Jews, that as they then circumcised infants, so we in like manner must
  bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them, but <hi>Paul</hi> saies plainly, that we must forsake
  <hi>Moses,</hi> and neither circumcise children now (as of old they did) nor
  yet walk after the manner of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, nor conform to such Jewish
  customes, therefore we may not now baptize them, which to do your selves, as
  you contend so to have it, so confesse it to be after the manner of
  circumcision.</p>
               <p>Whether therefore we shall believe him or you in this case judge
  ye.</p>
               <p>This, as it is of weight in it self, so it must needs be an
  argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> however, of force enough to stop the mouthes of
  all such as though they yield the law it self and circumcision to be ceased,
  yet will needs in point of Priesthood, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Churches, Tythes, Temples,
  outward administration, infants admission have all things at least after such a
  manner as the Jews had, and specially to Mr <hi>Marshall</hi> and Dr.
  <hi>Holms,</hi> and all such as assert, that the very command that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
  to circumcise infants of old, is vertually the command to us to baptize them:
  for thus saies not onely Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> but Dr <hi>Holmes</hi> also out

  7. of <hi>his animadversions,</hi> fetching his argument for infant baptism as

               <p>
                  <hi>Where there is a command for a thing never remanded, or
  contramanded, there the thing is still in force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there is a command for signing the infants of a
  believer, with the sign of the Covenant of Grace, Gen. 17. 7. 9. never yet
  remanded or contramanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo signing believers children with the sign of the
  Covenant of Grace (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptism now) is still in force.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> of which argument hath no lesse then three
  false assertions in it. For First, circumcision was not a sign of the Covenant
  of Grace (as baptism now is) nor did any further relate to the Covenant of
  Grace, then all other things under the law did <hi>viz.</hi> as types and
  shadows of the things to come; but that Covenant of which circmcision was giyen
  to be immediately a sign and token, was of that earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Canaan,</hi> made
  with <hi>Abrahams</hi> fleshly seed onely: nor Secondly, were they believers
  infants only, who were there commanded to be circumcised, but all the male
  infants and male servants also of every houshold of <hi>Abrahams</hi> posterity
  by <hi>Isaac</hi> onely, through their several generations, though the parents
  and masters were unbelievers, as the <hi>Iews</hi> were (for the most part of
  them) in all ages, and both they and theirs neverthelesse to be circumcised,
  while that Covenant of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision lasted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas he saies that circumcision of infants (for
  thats it he falsely <pb n="184" facs="tcp:42067:99"/> signs there with that name,
  <hi>viz.</hi> the sign of the Covenant of Grace) was never yet remanded, or
  contramanded, it is as false as all the rest for we see plainly that it was
  remanded by that text I am yet in hand with, <hi>viz. Act.</hi> 21. 22.</p>

               <p>Sith then Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> and D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Holmes</hi> both say
  (and so indeed you say all in effect) that the command for circumcision of
  infants was a command to us to baptize them, and therefore (unless we can shew
  that command to be remanded again) it is still in force to bind us to baptize
  them, I dare be bold to tell them that if infant circumcision, and infant
  baptism were both commanded together in that one and the same precept
  <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. where <hi>God</hi> bidds <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seed
  to circumcise their children, then they are both uncommanded again in that one
  and the same prohibition, wherein God by the mouth of <hi>Paul</hi> forbad the
  <hi>Iews</hi> to circumcise their children any longer: I say if infants baptism
  were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in that very command for the circumcision of infants, then by
  <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> for <hi>contrariorum contraria est ratio,</hi> infants
  baptism must needs be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> in the <hi>remanding</hi> of infants
  circumcision, the remanding of which by <hi>Paul,</hi> among all the
  <hi>Iewes</hi> that dwelt among the Gentiles, where he mainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised his
  Ministrie, is related plainly <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 21.</p>
               <p>To conclude then though I utterly deny, as being well assured
  that nor Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> neither have yet, nor
  ever will make it good, that the precept for circumcision, is so much as a
  virtual or consequential command to baptize infants, yet, if it be, <hi>I

               <p>And as there is no <hi>precept,</hi> so neither is there any

                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Marshal <hi>himself gives you good reason for that
  p. 40. of his Sermon, the Argument (saith he) from the term houshold, is not so
  strong to prove that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants did eat the passeover, as it is to prove they may
  be baptized, because no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture shews that the passeover doth belong

  <hi>Tombos viz.</hi> that <hi>we shall never find so good evidence out of the
  housholds eating the passeover, Exod. 12. thereby to prove that women did eat
  the passeover as this proves that the
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the house were
  baptized:</hi> but I must tell him first, that what influence other Sciptures
  give toward the proof of either one or the other makes these never the stronger
  simply, and in themselves, so but that their particular strength and weaknesse
  stands the same, but Secondly, how dares Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> say theres no
  other Scipture save that, is not that one particular sentence wherein the word
  hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold is exprest as eating the paschal lamb enough? specially when the next
  verse, or <pb n="188" facs="tcp:42067:101"/> the latter part of the same verse <hi>viz.
  Exod.</hi> 12. 4. saies plainly, that it was to be taken and eaten
  <hi>according to the number of souls in the house, and by every one according
  to his eating,</hi> and if the family were too little to eat it, they should
  join families together; are not children exprest undeniably here? are they not
  a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the number of souls capable to eat, every one <hi>pro suo modulo,</hi>
  according to the measure of his eating and digestion? and doth not this evince
  as much for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men? And whereas, for the exemption of women (not as holding
  these did not eat it, but to secure himself the more from that deadly wound,
  which he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware will light upon him if he grant that children did eat the
  passeover <hi>viz.</hi> our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing upon him from thence to their right to the
  supper, acccording to his own ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from infants circumcision to their
  baptism) he brings this reason <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>according to us they
  were not circumcised, and no uncircumcised person might eat the passeover,</hi>
  I have to or three things to say to it.</p>
               <p>First, that phrase, no uncircumcised person shall eat it, must
  either necessarily be understood concerning those uncircumcised ones onely, who
  were both capable of circumcision, and of whom circumcision was required, or
  else</p>
               <p>Secondly, it must be understood that the females were accounted
  as vertually circumcised in the males.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that very phrase that excludes all, and onely such
  uncircumcised ones from the passeover as were capable of circumcision, and of
  whom it was required, serves us against you thus far however as to include and
  enright all them to the passeover that were circumcised, and so if women did
  not (as none need doubt but that they did) yet all circumcised males, and
  cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>quently <hi>male
  children,</hi> as soon at least as they were capable to eat, were under a right
  to eat the passeover, and so as to prove you who deny them the supper, to be
  ingaged in the guilt of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing Gods grace, and robbing poor infants of
  their right, as well as we, if your own arguments be true, <hi>viz.</hi> that
  to deny such dispensations to infants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, the answerable ones to
  which were dispensed to them under the law, is to lessen the grace of God in
  the Gospel Covenant, and make it strai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> then it was under the Law, and to bereave little children of what
  belongs to them.</p>
               <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> where by the word housholds he should
  understand chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as well as others, for his own ends he leaves them out;
  but where by the word housholds such families are exprest, as in which he knows
  not that there was one infant, and may know (if there were) by the very places
  themselves, that they were excluded, yet there he winds things aboutto wind
  them in.</p>
               <p>By all this you see how little consequence is in the Argument,
  <hi>children were circumcised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo they must be baptized.</hi>

               <p>Yea (say you <hi>Ashford</hi> disputants in the tail of your
  argument) <hi>or else the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Gospel is worse to the spiritual
  seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>then it was to the carnall seed under the
  law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bus Sirs (to conclude this matter) I say no, for if by
  spirituall seed you mean Christians natural infants, I must (as before) cry
  shame on you still, for stiling them the spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
  for if <hi>Abrahams</hi> own <hi>semen carnis</hi> be not <hi>(qua sic)</hi>
  his <hi>semen fidei,</hi> are the <hi>semen carnis</hi> of believing Gentiles
  <hi>Abrahams semen fidei?</hi> but if by his spiritual seed you mean such as
  are so indeed i. e. true believers, are this spiritual seed ere the worse
  because a meer fleshly seed, may not without faith be signed as heirs together
  with them? how will you ever be able to make that good? yet again (to take your
  words so punctually as may be) by meer denial of baptism to your carnal seed,
  is the Gospel made worse to <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, then the same
  Gospel was to <hi>Abrahams</hi> carnal seed of old? no such matter, surely
  Sirs, for the Gospel was preacht but darkly to the Jews of old, which were
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> carnal seed, <hi>viz.</hi> onely in types, and figures, and
  shadows, <pb n="189" facs="tcp:42067:101"/> and prophecies pointing out onely <hi>Christum
  exhibendum,</hi> a saviour to come, but now its preacht not only to believers
  (that is <hi>Abrahams spiritual seed)</hi> but also to unbelivers, and to the
  whole world, and this more plainly too, and without a vail, holding forth
  <hi>salvatorem exhibitum,</hi> a saviour that hath already offered himself a
  ransom, and salvation by him in common to all, Iews and Gentiles, bond and
  free, even every creature that puts it not away from him, when tendered to him,
  <hi>Mark. 16. 15. 16. 1 Iohn</hi> 2. 2. so that the Gospel is as good now to
  the full to all men in its administration as it was of old, and in many
  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects far better, though no infants at all be baptized, and so I have done
  with this argument, and come to the next.</p>

               <p>As I replied then, so I reply still, that for ought I know the
  children of Turks and Pagans (dying in infancy) may be all saved, yet will it
  not follow (so much as probably) that therefore in reallity, or in my opinion
  either, the <hi>Devils</hi> may be saved also, which rude return is recorded by
  your selves to be then given, and stands for ever before the world, as the end
  of this your argument, and of your Disputation also, there being to this
  assertion of mine <hi>viz.</hi> for ought I know the children, or dying infants
  of Turks and Pagans may be all saved, no other answer given by you in the

  expected.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Sirs,</hi> as great an <hi>Extasie</hi> as you seem to
  be in about this position, yet I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you if I had not learn'd it before,
  yet I have learn't it since from your very selves, who so strange at it, to be
  a thing not so strange as true <hi>viz. that the dying infants of Turks and
  Pagans may be all saved,</hi> and that the dying infants in your Christendom
  are in no better condition then the dying infants of Turks and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans (for so
  I said, and not as you here misrelate it, then Turks and Pagans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
  for if the dying infants of infidels are in no worse condition then your dying
  infants, then surely yours are in no better condition then they, and that they
  are in no worse condition then yours, nothing need hinder you more then me (for

  the general state of little children declared in the Scriptures, which is this,
  viz. That of such is the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You see then how you teach us this precious piece of truth your
  selves p. 4. 5. therefore I hope you will learn it your selves, <hi>viz.</hi>
  that we are to hope well of such infants as have not by actual sin barred
  themselves from Salvation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us to teach it too in time, though
  hitherto you seem to be so far from giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to us to teach the same, that
  when we speak well of inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>nts,
  that have not by actual sin deserved exemption, and hope well of their
  salvation so dying, you so wretchedly forget it to be the doctrine your selves
  deliver, that with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation you ptotest against it as abominable, as if
  there were as little hope to be had of the salvation of such dying infants, as
  are not born in Christendome, as of the salvation of the very devils: but your
  first doctrine shall stand of the two for truth with me, from which, though you
  often contradict it your selves, I shal not be frighted by your bigg words, but
  still hope as well of one dying infant as another.</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>(Risum teneatis amici?)</hi> it is enough I think
  to set him on smiling who is never so deep in his dumps, to see what a most
  pat, and pertinent place of Scripture you have here dragged in to the proof of
  infant baptism, <hi>viz. 1 Thes.</hi> 4. 13. from whence <hi>(as the wheel
  barrow goes rumble to rumble so)</hi> it followes that infants are to be
  baptised: you might as well have said you may find it in the fifteenth of go
  look it, as send us to a text of so little tendency as this is of, to your
  present purpose: for what if we are not to mourn over the death of Saints, and
  Godly friends that sleep in Jesus, as those that can have no hope of such

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> (which
  is indeed the direct drift of the place) will it therefore follow that all
  those infants, that dy without baptism, are universally, and unavoidably
  damned? yet no less then this is here told by your selves to be your tenet,
  whilst you say our <hi>denial of baptism unto them destroies all hope of their
  salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Sirs is it so in earnest in your opinion, that no baptism no
  hope of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>Then thirdly, I have a treble charge to draw up against you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. of <hi>unchristian cruel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>y.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of <hi>point blank popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. of <hi>clear contrariety</hi> both to your selves, and
  to those very authors you refer us to, to read and learn by, and also to the
  very professed doctrine of the church of <hi>England</hi> whereof you profess
  to be the Ministers.</p>
               <p>First I must cry out oh the <hi>Unchristian cruelty</hi> that is
  hatched in your hearts, and here expressed, not onely to these thousands of
  infants, even of Christians that happen to dy unbaptized, at least to whom
  baptism is at this day denyed to be dispensed, but specially to that numberless
  number of infants of Turks, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and infidels, to whom in infancy your own
  Doctrine denies baptism, as well as ours, and consequently (if your own
  <hi>bloody tenet</hi> of no baptism no salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to dying infants were true)
  all hope of their salvation.</p>
               <p>Tis your common course to clamor and cry out against us, as
  having no chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian charitie, as being most inveterate, and cruel enemies to
  infants, only for denying the baptism of those few, to whom you dispense it, as
  well as those <hi>Myriads</hi> of little ones, to whom your selves deny it
  together with us: but I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all people, who are not already so perfectly
  prejudiced against us by your prating, as to stand resolved to believe nothing
  but your blind dictates, to judge between us whether we are so cruelly
  opinioned towards infants, who barely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <pb n="191" facs="tcp:42067:102"/> them
  baptism, believing the salvation notwithstanding of all that dy in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
  without it, or your selves rather, who deny that dispensation to all
  <hi>infidels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> which are twenty to one in the world, and yet hold
  that dispensation so necessary to salvation, that there is no hope of other
  then damnation to whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is denyed, whereas in confutation of you out
  of your own mouths (if your own sense of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 14 be true, where
  you contend to have the word <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> ones</hi> taken literally for infants) Christ himself saies there,
  that <hi>it is not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of my
  Father that so much as one of these little ones should perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, oh the <hi>palpable papistry</hi> which is here openly
  professed by you, who yet would seem to protest against every inch of it, for
  it is one of the grossest pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of popery to hold no salvation to infants
  without baptism, and one great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie between them and protestants; yet
  you give the cause thus far, as to grant it to be necessary, and effectual to
  salvation of infants (whether <hi>ex opere operato</hi> or no, as you are
  silent in it here, so pray tell us another time) that there need be neither
  doubt nor fear of such dying infants damnation to whom its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed, and can
  be no hope of the salvation of such as dy without it, or at least to whom
  <hi>doctrinally</hi> it is denied.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, oh the <hi>wretched contradiction,</hi> that is here
  given.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To your selves, who say above p. 5. <hi>that it is
  breach of Christian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to presume otherwise then well of such little
  infants, of whom it cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that by any actuall sin they have barred
  themselves or deserved exemption from salvation,</hi> and such are all infants
  in infancy, whether baptized or unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, whether of Christians or heathens;
  and yet here you say, there is <hi>no hope of the dying infants of
  infidels,</hi> and in case we deny baptism to them <hi>as little hope</hi> of
  the salvation of such dying infants, as are born of <hi>Christian parents</hi>
  also: Hay-Ho! I dare say the dog is not good Mutton, if this be not uniform
  Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, not only to other writers on this subject, as Mr.
  <hi>Cotton,</hi> who p. 85. of his book called, <hi>The way of the Churches in
  New-England,</hi> saith, <hi>one may remain a member of the invisible Church of
  the first born, when yet he hath neither part nor portion, nor fellowship in
  the particular flock and visible Church of Christ Iesus;</hi> which shewes (to
  the confutation of you, and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> also, who pins the salvation of
  infants so much upon their <hi>Churchmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and baptism)</hi> that infants
  may be supposed to be out of the <hi>Visible Church,</hi> and yet be hoped to
  be in a state of salvation also; I say not only to other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but to the
  writers your selves will us to peruse, <hi>viz. Calvin,</hi> and
  <hi>Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For first, <hi>Ursins Catechism,</hi> (as insufficient as it is
  to prove infant baptism) furnishes us with enough wherewith to confute this
  unsavory stuff you have here recorded, <hi>viz.</hi> the hopelesness of the
  salvation of such infants, to whom baptism is denyed, whose words are these
  <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Privatio sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenti non damnat si non

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The want of the sacrament doth not damn persons, that dy
  without it, if those persons do not contemn it</hi> (and whether infants in
  infancy can possibly be said to contemn it though their parents permit them to
  dy without it, needs no great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation) again <hi>Christ doth not ere the
  more deny salvation to whom baptism is denyed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>Calvins institutions</hi> confesses at large that
  baptism is not so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to salvation as you seem to make it: his words are

  to damn all infants to deny their right to baptism, then how damnable is your
  doctrine to that innocent age, who deny it to no lesse then 20 to one viz. all
  the dying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of unbelievers? but the best out is though your doctrine is
  so desperate and ungodly as to declare nought but damnation to all such, as the

  accepted in with you;</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that it was dispensed to <hi>Ishmael</hi> under no such
  notion as a seal of the Gospel covenant, but meerly as he was a male of

  house, or bought with his money; though visibly an heir to neither the earthly,
  nor the heavenly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> as wicked servants were not, and no doubt to

  assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that there can be no more conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the
  being of faith in them, then their having reasonable souls.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if from their non declaring it there can be no more
  concluding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their having faith, then against their reasonable souls,
  then there is no more concluding against the being of faith in one infant more
  then its being in another, or against its being in unbelievers infants than in
  those of believers, for the reasonable soul is in all, even in the infants of
  unbelievers, as well as of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if their non-declaring it be no ground to conclude
  against their having faith, yet I am sure it is ground enough to bar you from
  concluding that they have it, specially that this infant hath it, more then
  that, for though you confess there can be no conclusion made till you see the
  fruits of their faith, yet that is the bold conclusion you undertake to
  make.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whether we can upon its non appearance conclude
  against their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="196" facs="tcp:42067:105"/> faith yea or no, yet upon its non
  appearance we may boldly conclude against their baptism, and admittance into
  the visible Church here on earth, into which not an invisible habit of faith
  gives right, but an outward appearance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to believe, witness not
  my self only, who am of little credit with you, but Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> also,
  none of the least of your <hi>Champions</hi> that appear for infant baptism,
  whose very words p. 48. 49. of his <hi>Way of the Churches in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
  these are, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not the seed of faith, nor faith it self, that
  knitteth a man to this or that visible Church, but an holy profession of the
  faith, and professed subjection to the Gospell of Christ in their
  communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be ashamed therefore of such a monstrous position, that persons
  not appearing to believe in Christ can conclude no more against their faith in
  Christ, then against their reasonable souls.</p>

               <p>I know the multitude of Scriptures that speak in general, or at

  all them that believe not, as <hi>Mark 16. 15. 16. Iohn 3. 15. 16. 18. 19. 36.

  24. a most monstrous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake of all which, as also of the whole Scripture
  makes you miserably misbelieve this matter <hi>viz.</hi> the way that all dying

  not shall be damned, he that believeth not on the Son shall not see life,</hi>
  &amp;c. delivers his will and testament not onely concerning persons at age,
  but concerning infants in their very infancy also: whereas if you
  <hi>Divines</hi> had not <hi>Divin'd</hi> your selves to very dotage, you could
  not but understand, that little infants are not intended in any of these, or
  any other places that hold out faith as the way of our salvation: for do but
  judge in your selves, were it not shameful senslessnesse to read thus out of
  those places <hi>viz. God so loved the world</hi> &amp;c. that whosoever
  infants in infancy as well as men <hi>believe in him should not perish, but
  have everlasting life, those</hi> infants <hi>that do believe on him are not
  condemned,</hi> but <hi>those</hi> infants <hi>that believe</hi> not, <hi>are
  condemned already,</hi> and why? <hi>because they have not believed in the name
  of the onely begotten Son of God: And this shall be the condemnation of</hi>
  infants as well as men, <hi>that light</hi> and life <hi>is come</hi> to them,
  and yet infants believe it not, neither will come unto Christ that they might
  have life, but <hi>but love darknesse more then light, because their deeds are
  evil?</hi> for thus you may read it, if infants as well as men be there meant:
  and so were it not sottish to read thus out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 23. it was not
  written for <hi>Abraham</hi> onely that faith was imputed to him for
  righteousnesse, but for infants also, to whom it shall be imputed, <hi>if they
  do believe on him, that raised up Iesus our Lord from the dead</hi> &amp;c. so
  would it sound any whit savourly in the ears of one thats of a sound judgement
  to read <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15. 16. so as to understand infants together with
  others <hi>viz. go preach the Gospel to every creature, who ere believeth, and
  is baptized shall be saved, but whoever believes not,</hi> man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, old
  or young, infant or suckling <hi>shall be damned?</hi> would not this grate

  are they in any other Scripture (for ought I can find) with the best sight I
  have, where faith is spoken of, as the condition on our part, without which
  nothing is to be expected but condemnation: I am sorry <hi>Sirs</hi> to see you

               <p>Is not faith a work as well as repentance, and the rest? yea the
  main and principal work of the Law of Christ, i. e. the Gospel <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.
  28. 29.</p>
               <p>Secondly, is it not as difficult a work for infants to believe
  in Christ, as to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey Christs voice in other things, and are they not still as
  uncapable a subject to do that, as to do any more things that are required? why
  then not exempted from that for the sake of their incapacity, as well as from
  other things?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if the spirit doth go extraordinary waies to work at
  all about the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of infants (as you must confess he must) and brings
  them to it without, and besides the ordinary means, he brings men by, why will
  you tie, and limit him him more to the ordinary way, and meanes of faith, then
  of obedience in other matters, as repentance, self denyal &amp;c, as to their
  salvation, seeing he must go out of the road, and tract, in the saving of them,
  wherein he saves men, may he not as well save infants without faith, without
  which he will save no man, as without self deniall, and suffering, and
  confessing of Christ, &amp;c. without which he will save no man?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, specially since infants are not mentioned as meant a
  jot more in the places that speak of salvation by faith, then in the places
  that speak of salvation by obedience in all things; for as it is said, <hi>He
  that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall
  be damned,</hi> (infants no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed or meant there) so tis said as
  universally he is the Author of all them that obey him, and he shall take
  vengeance on all them that obey him not, and cut them off that hearken not to
  his voice (infants no way expresly excepted as not meant there.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:42067:107"/> The Scriptures therefore are still to be
  understood <hi>de subjecto capaci,</hi> when they promise or threaten things on
  conditions, and terms of faith, unbelief, and other good and evill works, as
  confessing and denying Christ, and exclusively of infants, where infants cannot
  possibly perform them; for as when its said he <hi>that works not let him not
  eat,</hi> infants are no where excepted, yet are not by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
  appointment to starve, though they work not, neither are they meant there
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot work, and as under law, when it was said, <hi>Cursed is he
  that continues not in every thing written therein, and do this and live,</hi>
  the way wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men were to live or dy was set forth by those words, and not
  the way wherein infants should be cursed or blessed, accordingly as they were
  or were not found therein in infancy; so <hi>Analogically</hi> when it's said
  under the Gospel <hi>the just must live by faith</hi> and <hi>he that believes
  not shall be damned,</hi> and <hi>Christ in flaming fire shall render vengeance
  to him that obeys not the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. it is to be understood as spoken
  of the waies, wherein men walking shall live or dy, and not at all of the way
  wherein he saves or damnes dying infants, for that stands still by good reason
  from Scripture that they being uncapable to do, what on mans part is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
  to life, i. e. to act belief (unless weel hold they are all damned dying in
  nonage, as you <hi>pittiful merciless</hi> men hold that 20 to one are, but we

  notable in that he saith, <hi>As many of you as have bin baptized into Christ

  (that no infants can be so in infancy is shewed above, as simply as Mr.

  I agree with Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism was not to be delayed,

                  </gap>ly
  agrees as much with me as I desire him, insomuch that in confirmation of this
  that I say, I mean to declare this truth <hi>viz.</hi> that persons are not to
  be baptized till <pb n="205" facs="tcp:42067:109"/> they are first made disciples, in the
  same words wherein he himself declares it to us by the space of well nigh a

  against himself, and all you that baptize infants, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially against his
  fellow souldier Mr. <hi>Marshal,</hi> and his critical observations, out of
  which he tells us that infants are not disciples before, but are made disciples
  by baptizing, I shall frame this argument <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Christs Rule be that persons should be baptized when they
  are first made disciples without delay, or immediately after they are converted
  and discipled, then persons are not to be baptized before they are converted
  and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Christs Rule is that persons should be baptized when

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo, they are not to be baptized before they are converted

                     </gap>or</hi>
  is most clear, and consequent, for if it be Christs will that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing should
  immediately follow our discipling persons, or converting them to the faith,
  then consequently tis his will that baptizing should not go before our
  disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling, and converting them: if baptism must be immediately subsequent to
  teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or making disciples by Christs commission, then teaching persons, or
  making them disciples must be <hi>Antecedent</hi> to baptism, unlesse both
  these be the mind of Christ in his commission whom and when to baptize,
  <hi>viz.</hi> that they should not baptize persons till they are taught and
  discipled, and yet (to go round again) that they should not teach them till
  they have baptized them i. e. in Mr. <hi>Marshals</hi> sense initiated them
  first to be disciples by baptism, and thereby admitted them to be taught, as
  for the <hi>Minor,</hi> which is this <hi>viz.</hi> That it is Christs rule
  that persons shall be baptized without delay, when they are first made
  disciples, or immediately after they are converted, as I have fully proved it
  already above, both from the commission for baptizing, and from Scripture
  example explaining that commission, and from the end and use of baptism, so I
  shall further prove it in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own words, then which I think
  there need no other (if they be well weighed) to convince a wise man that by
  Scripture rule no infants in infancy are to be baptized.</p>
               <p>To which purpose he writteth thus p. 126. 127. at large

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, in the commission</hi> Mat. 28. 19. 20. <hi>Christ

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly if any person be so impudent as to say, It is not
  the meaning of Christ that baptizing should immediately without delay follow
  discipling, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the constant example of Scripture; for there

                     </gap>ion that I can find of
  any one person that was baptized long after their discipling or that ever the
  Apostles of Christ did delay the baptizing of disciples,</hi> John 4. 1. 2.
  <hi>Iesus made and baptized more disciples then</hi> John. <hi>See how making
  and baptizing disciples are conjoined, Act. 2. 38. 41. the 3000 were presently
  baptized the same day that they were made disciples without staying till the
  morrow, though one would think the number of 3000 might have excused the delay,
  if they had taken lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time to do it in; And some would think that their
  conversion being so sudden the Apostles would have waited for a trial of their
  sincerity, but this is not the wisdome of God, though it seem to aim at the
  purity of the Church: Scripture tells us of another way Acts 8. 1. 2. the
  people of</hi> Samiaria <hi>when they believed were baptized without delay. And
  v.</hi> 13. 14. Simon Magus <hi>was presently baptized, though yet not brought

  Samarita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s <hi>were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
  baptized by</hi> Philip, <hi>before they had received the holy Ghost: for he
  was yet fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon none of them, onely they were baptized in the name of the
  Lord Iesus verse 16. So Acts 8. 36. 37. 38. the Eunuch was baptized in his
  journey as <pb n="206" facs="tcp:42067:110"/> they went, without delaying one day or hour
  after he professed himself to be a disciple. So was</hi> Paul <hi>baptized as
  soon as he rose from his blindnesse upon the words of</hi> Ananias, Acts 9. 18.
  <hi>So was</hi> Cornelius <hi>with his friends baptized immediately without
  delay, the same day</hi> Lydia <hi>and her houshold were baptized without delay
  Acts 16. 15. and the Iaylor the same hour of the night that he was discipled
  Acts 16. 38. So the</hi> Corinthians <hi>Acts 18. 8. and</hi> Ananias
  <hi>language to</hi> Paul <hi>repeated</hi> Acts 22. 16. <hi>is plain, and now
  why tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest thou? arise and be baptized &amp;c. and of the houshold of</hi>
  Stephanus <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>baptized, it is implied too; and it is most
  observable which is said in Iohn 3. 26. of Iesus himself that he baptized (by
  his disciples) and all men came unto him; where it is undeniable that Iesus
  baptized without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, even as fast as they came to him and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>fessed themselves disciples, and can
  we have a better example then the Lord Iesus himself?—And thus you
  see</hi> (saith he) <hi>that according to all the examples of baptism in the
  Scripture (not to speak of</hi> Johns <hi>baptism) there was no delaying, no
  not a day usually but they were all baptized as soon as they were

               </p>
               <p>Thus far are the very words of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> brought by

  ever baptized in the primitive times, but that all that ever were then
  baptized, did first believe and were converted, were first made disciples by
  the preaching of the Gospel to them, and did first come and professe themselves
  disciples, and thereupon were immediately admitted: which things I dare say,
  twill be out of doubt with all rational considerate impartial Christians, that
  they were never performed by any infants, and if not, then whether all these
  examples do not clearly shew rather that no infants were then baptized, then
  that any were or now ought to be, a child of 7. years old at least may easily
  decide it: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing so childish is Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> as to set down
  this at large, that he may thence make himself a clearer way (as by the
  constant example and practise of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive time) to prove your present
  practise of baptizing of infants: which premises and conclusion <hi>viz.</hi>
  that men and women of old were baptized without delay, so soon as ever they
  were converted to the faith, and were discipled and professed themselves
  disciples, therefore we must baptize the children of Christians in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, or
  else our practise is utterly inconsistent with the rule of Christ, and
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practise of the primitive times, and consequently a sinful

  128. they who baptize the children of Christians at age (as the
  <hi>Anabaptists</hi> do) cannot possibly do it when they are first discipled, I
  am so amazed at that expression, that I can hardly believe he minded what he
  said when he pend it, nor do I think the man had his wits well about him when
  he wrote all the rest that follows in proof therof through out that whole
  chapter of his, where the further he proceeds, the more he abounds and sinks
  ore head and ears in absurdities, contradicting himself and his own
  prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and overthrowing the very thing he there prosecutes the proof of,
  for</p>
               <p>First, so farre is it from being impossible to baptize believers
  children immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after they are discipled, if we forbear them till they
  come to years, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is impossible that they should be discipled at
  all till then, in such a way as all those were discipled in, whom he hath
  produced as examples in this case, for whatever conversion there seems to him
  to be of all, or at least the most of the children of believers so timely, that
  neither themselves nor others be can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled <pb n="207" facs="tcp:42067:110"/> when by
  the preaching of the Gospel they are brought over both to believe, and to be
  willing to obey the Lord Jesus, and do freely, seriously and (as may seem to
  us) sincerely professe their faith in him, and their readiness to obey him, and
  their repentance from those dead works, and waies of the flesh they have
  for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lived in (unless he suppose it possible that these should live in
  sin) and their desires to be baptized in the name of Christ for remission of
  their sins: then (I say) they appear first to be discipled <hi>in foro
  hominum,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>ubi vides ibi fides.</hi> where we
 see it is there we say it is.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; Ecclosiae</hi> (for whatever
  they were before <hi>in foro Dei</hi> is nothing to us) and then and not before
  to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p>As for us therefore we have a steady rule to go by in the
  baptizing of persons, according to which we still baptize them as of old they
  did, when first discipled, yea though they are persons whose parents were
  Church-members, or in other meer <hi>relative</hi> only, or <hi>reall</hi>
  discipleship, yet they are first made Disciples when they first appear to be
  converted, witness the three thousand <hi>Iewes,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
  himself doth instance in; who though they, and their parents were all
  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively holy by birth, and Church-members of the visible Church of old, and
  as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is pleased to say most simply p. 20. both disciples and
  Servants of God by very nature, yet in the Gospel sense they were first made
  disciples, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled so as thereby to be in right to baptism, when they
  were by <hi>Peter</hi> convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only, and not before: so that if the children
  of Christians had now either such a <hi>Relative</hi> discipleship (as he calls
  it, and as he saies the <hi>Iews</hi> children had once by birth) and such a
  real discipleship, or invisible conversion to God in very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, as he
  deeply do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>es all such to have so
  soon as ever they they are born, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which yet they have indeed, yet
  nevertheless that they may be, and also must be first discipled when they are
  at years in that sense wherein discipling was in the Commission enjoined in
  order to baptism, it is evident by Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own alledged Instance
  of the <hi>Iews Acts</hi> 2. who though they were (according to Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> himself as nigh, and in truth more nigh to God by birth, than
  the fleshly seed of believing Gentiles are, yet were not for all that their old
  Church-membership and discipleship (for indeed they were (not in infancy) but
  when grown up discipled unto <hi>Moses)</hi> admitted to baptism thereupon,
  till they were first discipled unto Christ, and had both heard, and gladly
  received the word of the Gospel: neither were ever any (as appears by all the
  Examples forecited) of what parents soever descended, though of
  <hi>Abraham</hi> himself admitted to baptism in the primitive times, till
  discipled, i. e. till visibly appearing, and verbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at least professing to
  repent, believe and imbrace the Gospel: nor is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for men, to whom
  Christ gives order to make disciples to him, to do it any other way than by
  instructing persons till such time as they learn, and receive the things that
  are taught them.</p>
               <p>Moreover to let pass that round he runs p, 127. where after he
  had shewed so abundantly, that to be Christs disciples gave persons admission
  immediately to baptism (to go round again) he expresses himself thus lin. 32.
  that baptism ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth them to be his disciples; whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
  asserts, that we cannot possibly baptize children of Christians at age,
  immediatly after they are first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, because we cannot possibly know
  when such children are first discipled, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be in their first infancy,
  as I have shewed him already what a steady rule, &amp; direct period of time we
  keep to in baptizing as they did in the primitive times, <hi>viz.</hi> as soon
  as they are first discipled, i. e. when first they appear to us truly to be
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and profess seriously and sincerely (as far as we can judge) to
  repent from their sins, and believe in Christ, and desire, and profer to be
  baptized in his name for the remission of sins, so I must return his own
  proposition upon him' that they who baptize the children of Christians in
  infancy (as the <hi>Anti-baptists</hi> do) cannot possibly do it when they are
  first discipled, and that because they cannot possibly know when such persons
  are first made disciples, and except they account them to <pb n="208" facs="tcp:42067:111"/> be first discipled as we do, <hi>viz.</hi> when professing verbally,
  and when first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing visibly and (for ought we can discern) truly to
  believe and repent from their sins, and desire baptism, which things no infants
  ever do.</p>

  this of <hi>nominall</hi> Christians, or the seed of Christians at large (which
  with Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> at least are born Christians) but of the children of

  how then do so many of them as well of the seed of meer nominal Christians,
  prove wretches, and ungracious a great while, till God workes on them, and many
  of them, to the grief of their parents, even to their dying day? and yet thus
  it should seem they are in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> opinion, so that if they be
  baptized in their first infancy, under the notion of such, they are in all
  likelyhood baptized when they are first made disciples even immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
  the point, and period of their conversion: and besides if they may so safely be
  supposed all, or most of them to be truly converted, and upon that account
  bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in their first iefancy, as he saies, then how doth this square a

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That men are usually who are born and brought up of

  then should others know it? and when Mr.</hi> Tombes <hi>would have baptized me
  I cannot tell, and as large experience as I have had in my Ministry of the
  State of Souls, and the way of conversion, I dare say I have met not with one
  of very many that would say they knew the time of their Conversion, and of
  those that would say so by reason that they then felt some more remarkable
  change, yet they discovered such stirrings and workings before, that many I had
  cause to think were themselves mistaken; and that I may not tell men only of
  mine own experience and those of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I was once at a meeting of
  very many Christians, most eminent for zeal and holinesse of most in the land,
  of whom diverse were Ministers, and some at this day as famous and as much
  followed as any I know in</hi> England, <hi>and it was there desired, that
  every one should give in the manner of their conversion, that it might be

  either themselves or others, whereupon he concludes that if we baptize them at
  age, though never so punctually at the time of their profession of faith,
  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and desire of baptism<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we cannot possibly baptize them when
  first disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, or immediately after conversion, as we ought to do by the
  example of the primitive times (wherein yet they did thus, and no otherwise,
  witnesse all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of his own alledging) but those that baptize them
  without delay so soon as ever they are born, they cannot do otherwise then jump
  just with the very time wherein they are first discipled (according to the
  primitive pattern he himself pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, wherein of all that were baptized,
  whether Iews or Gentiles, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their being discipled, we read not
  of one infant) And good reason why they must needs hit right upon their first
  being discipled or converted, that baptize them in the first infancy, for
  though <hi>the time of the first conversion or discipling of the children of
  Christian parents be not scarce possible to be conjectured at ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by
  themselves or others,</hi> yet (to go round again) it may so safely and surely
  be supposed and conjectured to be in the first of their infancy, that they may
  war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably be baptized then (as then newly made disciples) without any danger
  of aberration from either Christs commission or the primitive custom of
  baptizing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons when first discipled, and professing themselves disciples:
  <hi>O the wisdom!</hi> he that being in the fire would not come out to hear how
  bravely <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> brings about, and about again his businesse in that
  8 chapter of the second part of his book, tis pitty but he should be burnt.</p>
               <p>And lastly whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> queries so oft when Mr.
  <hi>Tombs</hi> would have such baptized, the set time of whose conversion? is
  not distinctly known lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> to tell him his mind as he
  sees good himself, I tell him (if he ask me the same question) that in my mind
  such whose conversion is not known when it is (as by his own confession the
  conversion ofChristians children some times is not, witnesse that one in which
  he instances, and (as few as he knowes of that sort) yet how many hundreds of
  the children of Religious parents (among whom I my self make one) do know when
  they were first truly converted? such I say should be baptized as neer as may
  be, upon the time of their conversion and becoming disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and if it have
  been then fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>owd, it must be
  after as soon as it can, but in no wise so many years before it, as the priests
  unviversally do it: and such of whom it is not known <hi>nec per se, nec per
  alios,</hi> when they first were discipled, and converted) but oh how do I
  fear, that as he that never doubted never belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, so many of those implicit
  converts Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> talks on, that never knew when they were discipled
  and converted, were never yet truly discipled

                  </gap>or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at all to the truth
  as it is in Iesus, but as they had it more by tradition from their fathers,
  then unfained search of Scriptures) such I say of whom tis not known when they
  first were converted and discipled, shall by my consent be baptized, when ever
  it is first known that they are converted and discipled unto Christ, by their
  own profession of their conversion and discipleship, and desire of baptism, and
  this not by my consent alone, but by the joint consent of all these very
  Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself hath coted for our example and
  warrant, all which if (as far as Christs own precept and practise, and the
  primitive Churches example can do it) they do not warrant the baptism of all,
  and onely such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as were first taught, or made disciples by preaching,
  or instructed till they both learnt, believed and imbraced the Gospel, and
  professed themselves disciples and offered themselves to baptism, and
  consequently of no infants, then for my part Ile lay aside all sense and
  reason, as no more to be heeded as a help to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Scriptures, and
  turn a very Tom-fool, and he that can Altobe logick these Scripture
  institutions and instances into <hi>plain Scripture proofs of infant Church
  membership and baptism, Erit mihi magus Apollo:</hi> for theres no mention of
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants <pb n="211" facs="tcp:42067:112"/> either expressely or implicitly in any one of
  them: Oh (therefore to <hi>Eccho</hi> back to Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> a little in
  much what his own words to us concerning those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures p. 127) <hi>that
  those who are so inclinable to seperation</hi> from the primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
  would consider the unfitnesse of infants to be admitted by baptism to be Church
  members under the Gospel! <hi>Oh that they that</hi> inchurch <hi>whole

  <hi>and will have</hi> no trial at all, <hi>and discoveries of the work of

  hazard as they fall from the belly within the bounds of that parish where they
  are plac't, and <hi>popified, would but lay to heart all these Scripture
  examples, and make more conscience of observing their rule, and not presume to
  be wiser and holier then God, when it was mans first over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw to desire to be

  in adding other Subjects to his ordinances, then himself appointed: which

  I do not think he will be offended with me for doing as he did</hi> i. e. for
  baptizing none but such as believe and professe themselves disciples, and as
  repent of their sins, and desire to be baptized in the name of Christ for the

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Marshal is pleased <hi>ponere obicem</hi> to
  object, and bolt in here, that <hi>we cannot say none in these places were
  baptized, but such as did thus, i. e. believe and professe themselves disciples
  p. 217. to Mr.</hi> Tombs <hi>because the word</hi> onely <hi>is not here,</hi>
  I may well call it <hi>obicem,</hi> or <hi>objectionem obularem,</hi> a hint
  not worth a half penny; and if he appeal to his own conscience, it will tell
  him no lesse; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse what ere he thinks, I say again, all that were
  baptized in the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med places, were such as are there specified to be
  profest converts and believers, and if there were any more let him assign and
  shew us whom, and weel believe him: as for the housholds himself is in the
  sands, whether there were any infants in them or no, and I have shewd above,
  that they that were baptized in them, are exprest all by some clause or other
  exclusive of infants, and conclusive onely of adult disciples: besides Mr.
  <hi>Cotton</hi> confesses that the infants were not baptized with their
  parents, and that the infants that were brought to Christ were not baptized
  at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all (for ought he knows) not their parents neither, and here are all
  the Scriptures that declare how baptism was done then, and to whom, most of
  which are cited by Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himself, from which you cannot possibly
  scrape so much as any old odd end of an example for such a businesse as your
  baptism. As for us, besides that plain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we have in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
  even every whit of this is plain president for our baptism, and comes into our
  assistance against all your cavils (O ye Priests) for thus I argue
  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The baptism of men and women professing faith in the Lord
  Iesus, confessing sins, calling on the name of the Lord &amp;c. is a baptism,
  yea all the baptism that the Scripture speaks of, either in way of command or
  example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the baptism which we dispence, is a baptism of men and
  women professing faith in our Lord Iesus, confessing sins, calling on the name
  of the Lord, gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the word &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo that baptism which we dispense is a baptism, yea all
  the baptism the Scripture speaks of in way of either command or
  example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Sirs,</hi> how hath Satan bewitched you that you
  cannot believe and obey the truth? what will you onely think things, and thrust
  your thoughts of them as oracles upon all others? will you imagine and suppose,
  and dream, and dote, and fancy, and fain a baptism, that the Scriptures and
  first Churches never knew, and then father your figments upon the Scriptures,
  and fasten them as the <pb n="212" facs="tcp:42067:113"/> fashion which, the whole world
  must be forct to follow and conform to?</p>
               <p>Moreover I do not at present remember any one part of Scripture,
  which your selves summon into your help in this case of infant baptism, that
  doth not yield ammunition, and much matter against you more then for you,
  unlesse it be one or two used by your selves, which one may as well with
  <hi>Skoggin</hi> untile the house to look for an hare as urge either <hi>pro or
  con</hi> about infants baptism, so farre shall he be from finding in them any
  proof for that, or the true baptism either: as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. 1
  Thess.</hi> 4. 13. There are but two places that I know of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those I
  have already turned upon you above, that are held out by any of you out of the
  armory of Scripture in defence of infant baptism, and those are <hi>Col. 2. 12.
  1 Cor.</hi> 10. 1. 2. both which not onely knock sprinkling oth'head, but may
  also very easily be sheathed in the bowels of baby-baprism: As for the first it
  speaks (as well nigh all scripture doth, not much medling with infants) not
  one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to, but of adult disciples only, of whom as well as to whom (and not of
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants) in way of satisfaction to them, and answer to those that would have
  brought in the old circumcision made with hands among them, <hi>Paul</hi> saies
  ye are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised with the circumcision made without hands, which
  circumcision without hands there spoken of, is not baptism neither (as some
  d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eam, who thence also draw in
  circumcision and baptism to be of so neer kin that as they have both one name,
  so they must both have one subject also) for baptism is no more done
  with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hands then the other, but the sanctification or inward
  circumcision of the heart, cutting off the foreskin i. e. the filth of the
  heart, which things infants do not, in token of which he tells them they are
  (not sprinkled) but buried i. e. overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in water with Christ in the
  outward baptism, wherin also they are risen with him through faith &amp;c. All
  which things he that imagins they more include then exclude the sucking infants
  of such, to whom he speaks, is no man in discretion with me.</p>
               <p>As for the other place its most evident the Apostle speaks not
  of baptism litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally but <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>aphoically</hi> onely there, they were baptized unto <hi>Moses</hi>
  i. e. by the visible tokens of Gods presence amongst them <hi>viz.</hi> the
  cloud and Sea assisting and siding with them, and overthrowing their
  adversaries, they were confirmed in the belief of God, and his servant
  <hi>Moses,</hi> as we by baptism are in the faith of Gods goodnesse to us, and
  of his Son Jesus Christ: in further confirmation of which meer figurative sence
  of the word <hi>[baptized]</hi> you may do well to consider that though they
  were said to be baptized in the cloud, and in the sea, which phrases
  however<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sound forth such a total immersion as is not in two or three
  drops of water fingered on the face, yet they were not so much as wetted with
  either the cloud or the sea, for its said <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 21. 22. the sea
  was made dry land un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and they went through it dry shod, or on dry
  ground, which they could not be well said to do had it so much as rained upon
  them, such a figurative sence of the word <hi>[baptize]</hi> there Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> himself denies not p. 90. yet Dr. <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> urged that
  place in a publique dispute at <hi>Petworth Ian.</hi> 1651. as one of his
  arguments for infant baptism, besides Secondly, if you will needs have it
  proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken that they were baptized really, and not <hi>quasi</hi>
  baptized, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> yields they were, and if you will needs make
  that baptism such an emblem of ours, that ours must have an adequate subject to
  that, which say you, was infants as well as parents, then twill put you to your
  trumps to excuse your selves handsomly in your now denying to infants the same
  spiritual meat and drink in the supper, which they then eat and drank of in a
  figure also <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Manna</hi> and the <hi>Rock,</hi> which both
  were no other <hi>(Antitypically)</hi> then the bread and wine are mistically
  in the supper i. e. the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>For all your vain boasting therefore of what innumerable
  arguments you have from Scriptures, I say the Scriptures are sure enough on our
  side, nevertheless ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the word in a sutable sense you do well to call your
  Scripture armes or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>innumerable,</hi> for indeed they are not to
  be numbred (for even <hi>unit as,</hi> 
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:42067:113"/> much more
  <hi>nonit as non est numerus)</hi> being no more than just none at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas you boast of the <hi>innumerable</hi>
  Arguments which may be brought for your infant rantism from reason, the full
  force of reason is utterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, and so wholly assistant to our cause,
  that the unreasonablest man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you will once see it, when sound reason
  comes to reign, and sway the scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indeed. Yea not to stand reasoning on it
  now how reasonless a thing it is to ask a company of men and women, as the
  priests were wont to do at the font, thus <hi>viz.</hi> do you believe in God
  the Father, and Christ &amp;c. and will you be baptized in this faith? and when
  they answered yes, that is all our desire, then instead of them who profess
  their faith and desires to be baptized, to take a small sucking babe out of
  their armes, and dat him with a drop or two on the face, and send away all the
  other unbaptized.</p>

  of any place of <hi>Iustins</hi> genuine works, who is the antientest father
  extant next the Apostles, whose works are accounted on, that there is so much
  as the name of infant baptism, much more the thing; yea he tells you ye may as

  tis once mentioned in a spurious book falsely called his, out of which book Mr.

  nor yet Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> in their replies, nay they rather seem to grant
  that its to be doubted it was so, which makes me as well as Mr.
  <hi>Blackwood,</hi> not a little wonder that Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> should quote
  it with so much confidence, I mean so as to assert it thereupon as a matter
  manifest, that the Church (counting from the time of <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>
  viz. 150) hath bin possest of the priviledg of infant baptism for the space of
  1500 years and upwards, for had he not doubted but that the words the cites
  were without question the words of <hi>Iustin</hi> himself, he had not had sin,
  but now he hath no cloak, sith he demonstrates to all men <hi>Dubitatum per
  magis dubium,</hi> and tells the world to make them believe that
  <hi>Iustin</hi> disputes the condition of children that dye baptized and
  unbaptized, when yet its not believed, but much doubted by himself, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
  <hi>Iustin</hi> did any such thing yea or no: as to the words Mr.
  <hi>Marshal</hi> p. 4. of his sermon cites out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> who lived
  toward the end of the second <hi>Century,</hi> which Englisht are thus <hi>viz.
  Christ came by himself to save all, all I say, who are born again unto God,
  infants and little ones &amp;c.</hi> its not likely that in this sentence that
  father by the word <hi>[born again]</hi> meant baptism (as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>
  and Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> contend) for by that sence they father such absurdity
  upon that their father, as children that pretend to honour their father, may be
  ashamed of, whilst they make him say, Christ came to save all infants that are
  baptized, when as neither all infants, that are baptized are actually saved,
  <hi>quâ</hi> bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, nor are any unbaptized infants damned,
  <hi>quâ</hi> not baptized, but both alike saved as both alike they either
  dye before they have bard themselves by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al sin, and derserved exemption,
  or living to years believe and obey Christ, and both alike damned as living to
  years they both alike obey not his Gospel, but however let Mr. <hi>Blake</hi>
  and Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> squeeze what they can from the quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it must yet
  remain as doubtful whether the speech of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (if it were his

  the speech fathered on <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> (though it be of infants baptism) were
  at all his own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so what dubious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence the second century affords,
  so much as <hi>de facto,</hi> that infant baptism was then in being, all men
  may see, whilst you can say no more then perhaps it was so, and a fool may say
  as much as perhaps it was not, which is a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble answer to that
  argument, for tis commonly said in the Schooles (saies Mr. <hi>Marshal)</hi>
  that <hi>fortè it a, solvitur per fortè non.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, but what if your testimony <hi>de facto</hi>
  concerning the practise of infant baptism in the second century were as clear,
  as tis cloudy, yet what green headed anuquity is this in comparison of that we
  plead from <hi>viz.</hi> the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? when you are stormed out of
  all your strong holds then you send us still to ages above us, and cry out your
  practise is of 1500 years standing, but sith you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say as we can of ours,
  tis above 1600 years old (nor is yours now likely to live to it) as good you
  had said but 15 for our way onely being found in the first century, and yours
  not at all before the second, we are a people so much elder then you upstarts,
  that your <hi>antiquity</hi> is but <hi>novelty</hi> with us, whoregardlesse of
  what by mans wisdome was foisted in in after ages, can aver with as much
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence as you can that now it is that from the beginning it was not so,
  nor yet in end shall be: I much marvel why Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> contents
  himself to preach po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively no otherwise then thus, p. 3. <hi>viz. this
  priviledge of baptizing infants the Christian Church hath bin in possession of
  for the space of 1500 years and upwards:</hi> he might as easily have said
  1600, had his ground been as good for that as for the other, and yet his ground
  for the other is so infirm, and sinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, that I believe he must fall
  down as low as the third century, before he find sure footing for his proof of
  no more then the bare practise of infant baptism.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Ius</hi> of it its nere the nearer, if he could
  prove the matter of fact to be in the second, though that still is the main
  question betwen us, sith tis confest by Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> that he uses not
  the Testimony and judgements of the Antients to witnesse to the truth of it,
  but onely to prove a then practise of infant baptism, and the question <hi>de
  jure</hi> whether infants ought to be baptized, <hi>no one of the fathers, nor
  yet the joint consent of many</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> p. 58. of his to
  Mr. <hi>Blackwood) is a competent Iudge,</hi> therefore if any of you, who
  stand so much upon that <hi>young antiquity</hi> of it, and plead the authority
  of the Church and fathers shall argue thus, tis 1500 years old, therefore it is
  1600 you live below that candor ingenuity, and discretion that I find in Mr.
  <hi>Marshal</hi> and <hi>Mr Blake,</hi> who both deny your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, and in
  this case close with us in the very truth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as for the third century, tis somewhat more then
  probable that such a superstition as infant baptism was comming in at least, or
  else tis like there would not have been such <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> as
  was about it, for, true, <hi>Origen</hi> (if the Testimonies fathered on him be
  his own (which he who well weighs what evidence is put in to the contrary by
  Mr. <hi>Blakwood</hi> p. 34 of his Rioynder to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> where he
  saith, <hi>that the original of Origen is lost, that the Translator confesses
  he added many things of his own, that</hi> Erasmus <hi>saies one cannot be sure
  whether one read</hi> Ruffinus <hi>or</hi> Origen, <hi>that the learned put his
  commentary on the</hi> Romans <hi>among his counterfeit works, as much
  sophisticated by</hi> Russinus, and also what is said by Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> too
  (notwithstanding all that Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> brings p. 15. 16. 17. 18. of
  his to Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi> whereby to salve it, will find small ground to
  believe) <hi>Origen</hi> I say, a man of many errors, stiles it a tradition
  received from the Apostles, which if you will believe implicitly you may, but
  else you need not, for tis no more then a bare scripturelesse assertion,
  <hi>Cyrian</hi> also, and a Councel of 66 bishops, almost contemporary to
  <hi>Origen,</hi> are supposed to be of some such mind, but upon such silly
  grounds, as you that now plead infants baptism, are ashamed of, witnesse Mr.
  <hi>Blake</hi> p. 40 who denies them not to be erroneous as Mr.
  <hi>Blakwood</hi> calls them, and therefore you may as well be ashamed of their
  opinion and expression of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <pb n="216" facs="tcp:42067:115"/> it being (for
  all their reasons) as scriptureless as that of <hi>Origen,</hi> who brings
  no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prove what he said.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Babist.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Mr.</hi> Marshal <hi>p. 18. tells you that it was
  because none opposed the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of infant-baptism, which if they had,</hi>
  Origen <hi>would no doubt have maintained by Scripture, as well as affirmed it
  to come from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi>

            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Baptist.</head>
               <p>This is strange, when it is most evident, and Mr.
  <hi>Marshall</hi> himself denies it not, that famous <hi>Tertullian,</hi> the
  first of that Century, that might in respect of his Seniority to
  <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> be stiled a father to them both,
  perswades by many reasons to deferre the baptism of children, as most
  profitable, Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let them become Christians when they know Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in another place, <hi>It behooves them that are about to
  enter into baptism to pray with frequent prayers, fastings, kneelings,
  watchings, and with the confession of all their sinnes past,</hi> which things
  infants (we know) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do.</p>
               <p>First, then I appeal to your own consciences, and Mr.
  <hi>Marshalls</hi> also, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not a plea against it as unlawful,
  for to decline whats most profitable is unlawful.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whether here be not <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi>
  among the Fathers about it, and so though their testimony serves to prove what
  Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> brings it for, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was practised in
  their times, yet it serves not to your purpose, who upon the Fathers and their
  churches authority, would gather and ground the right of that practise, for who
  but children will go about to prove the verity of a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise by the Authority
  of those Fathers, whose witnesse agrees not together, and who are contradictory
  to one another in their testimonies of it, and some of whose testimonies in
  that thing are quite and clean contradicted by the testimonies of such as
  concurre with them almost in every thing else? for so I may truly say the
  testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Father <hi>Austin</hi> are, who in one place <hi>viz. ad
  Volusianum Ep.</hi> 3. (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> quotation of him p.
  51.) writes thus <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Custome of the Church in the baptizing of infants is by
  no means to be despised, nor to be accounted superfluous, nor yet were it at
  all to be credited, were it not a tradition of the Apestles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus this Father who though inferior to the other in time, yet
  is not inferiour to the chiefest of them in your Account; but he brings no
  Scripture neither any more then <hi>Origen</hi> for the same, yet it is like
  some sleighted it as superfluous in his daies: but <hi>Ludovicus vives,</hi> a
  man so observant of <hi>Austin,</hi> that he wrote <hi>Annotations</hi> upon
  him, in those very <hi>Annotations</hi> of his upon the 27th chapter of the
  first book <hi>De civit. Dei</hi> (according to Mr. <hi>Denns</hi> quotation of
  him p. 51. against Dr. <hi>Featley)</hi> is so far from crediting that he
  corrects <hi>Austin</hi> rather as to that piece of faith saying,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That of old it was the custome to baptize none unless they
  were of full ago, and did desire baptism in their own persons; and did
  undeestand what it was to be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now who can safely build so much as you do (unless he mean to be
  both blindly guided with you, and a blind guide to the blind) on the authority
  of such Fathers, as (saving their honesty in what they knew, and eminency in
  some things, were yet so silly in some others, that they did the Church no such
  good office as they wot of, who ere they were that canonized them into such
  fatherhood over the faith, that their opinions must be as <hi>Oracles</hi> for
  all to act by: witnesse good Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> the last in that
  Catalogue, who (saving that he knew some truth, as other honest men did in
  those dismal daies wherein he lived) was wrapt <pb n="217" facs="tcp:42067:115"/> up into a
  mist of so many other errors, besides that of infants baptism, that we may
  boldly use the proverb, <hi>viz. Bernardus non videt omnia,</hi> for (as Mr.
  <hi>Blackwood</hi> quotes out of his 65 ser. in p. 31. of his storm) speaking
  of some Christians that opposed the popish stream he saith thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They laugh at us, because we baptize infants, because we
  pray for the dead, because we require the praiers of Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which doctrine, though falling from a father, is yet indeed
  too ridiculous to be received for truth, in these daies of its return from
  captivity, by any but meer children in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I appeal to your consciences (not to Mr.
  <hi>Marshalls</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> here, for they from the Fathers
  assert no more than matter of fact, that infant-baptism was then, whilest you
  matter of faith that it ought to be) whether that foretold testimony of
  <hi>Tertullian</hi> may not ballance with those of <hi>Origen, Cyprian,
  &amp;c.</hi> who were not so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ear
  the pure times of the Apostles as he, and whether he were not as likely as
  <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> to know if it had been so that
  infant-baptism was a Tradition from the Apostles, and in case he did know it,
  to what end he should deny it to be now dispensed; or do you imagin him a man
  of so mean a conceit of the Apostles wisdome, and so highly conceited of his
  own, that he would forbid that as unprofitable, which the Apostles prescribed,
  and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a more convenient way himself? sure he must know as well as they
  if it were Apostolicall, and they possibly might not know so well as he that it
  was not, being all <hi>Iuniors</hi> to him and one of them, <hi>viz.
  Cyprian,</hi> so much beholding to him for much of what he had, that he
  dignified him with the name of his <hi>Master,</hi> such a diligent disciple,
  i. e. reader and learner of <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> was he, that <hi>Da mihi
  Magistrum</hi> was his common speech of him; so that his rational diswasion
  from infant-baptism, cannot but be a more cogent ground of faith on one hand,
  then <hi>Origens</hi> Scriptureless position, and <hi>Cyprians
  Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick,</hi> and reasonless reasons, and perswasion to it are one the
  other, unless you will needs so father it over the Fathers themselves, as to
  <hi>authorize</hi> which of them and which of their sentences you please,
  disowning the rest, as not <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox,</hi> or <hi>Authentick,</hi> further
  then they serve your own turns, and then by my consent they shall be no longer
  fathers to you, but you fathers over them, and us too in their stead.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Marshall,</hi> who hath a longer arm then every
  body, reaches us a rap yet by a certain quaere, which he propounds to Mr.
  <hi>Tombs</hi> p. 35. 36. 37. to which till he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>h some answer he will conceive we are so sick of
  <hi>Tertullian</hi> that weele say no more of him. his quaere is this.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Babist.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why may not the diswasion cited out of</hi> Tertullian de
  baptismo infantium <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be interpreted of the infants of infidells
  only, whose baptism he would have deferred, till they come to years, and to
  profess faith themselves, and not of the infants of Christians? I am inclined
  to believe that to be the true meaning of the place for such
  considerations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, because</hi> Tertullian <hi>alledges this double
  reason why he would have the baptism of little ones delaied, viz. least their
  Sponsors, or Sureties be in haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of not fulfilling the promises they make
  on their behalf, by either their own mortality, or the childrens proving
  untoward, or inclineable to iniquity, for whom they undertake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Because tis clear and evident by the 39th. Chapter
  of</hi> Tertullian <hi>book, the 18th. Chapter whereof hath this disswasion to
  baptize little ones, that</hi> Tertullian <hi>did acknowledge that the children
  of believers are by birth</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signati sanctitatis &amp; salutis,
  <hi>counted holy from</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. <hi>not</hi> sancti <hi>till they be

  by nature, yea such a sanctity, and the very same as is called faderall, or

               <p>First, and that thus confessing that that good old Father, who

  together with you, though not so gross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you, as touching the genuine sense
  of the Agostle in that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. When he saith to parents of two
  religions in one civil relation, that their children are holy, and to own a
  certain meer reputative holiness as there meant, which is not to other
  children, yet denying altogether that he held any such thing, as that thereupon
  these children should be baptized, for that is a fictitious conclusion of your
  own, which follows not, if such a reputative holiness as you wot of were there
  meant, nor doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> so much as hint it in that place, which
  <hi>Mr. Marshal</hi> is so brag off, that he supposes he wounds us shrewdly by

  some sense a prerogative of seed, so far as they may be a seed of prayers, more
  then othess, and in some sense too (not yours) a holinesse above others i. e.
  as they may be sanctified to their parents, as blessings, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing else
  may be by their prayers, whether good or evill in it self (if yet what is blest
  to us may be properly denominated holy, as every creature is said to be

  bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize <pb n="219" facs="tcp:42067:116"/> any at all: and as for <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
  though he mistaking <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning, holds such are holy by a kind of
  prerogative of seed (as Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> speaks) yet tis very questionable
  to me, whether it be that so transcendent kind of birth holiness, and
  prerogative you expound him of, and howbeit Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> and Mr.
  <hi>Marshall</hi> would fain fetch that father in by force of forged
  construction to witnesse as a <hi>God-father</hi> to their <hi>federal</hi>
  holinesse; yet I cannot easily believe by his words, that he hath respect to
  any more then a bare <hi>recounting,</hi> and reputing these to be holy, in a
  sense abstract from any reallity of their being holy by natural birth, and in
  their childhood as the <hi>Doctor</hi> vainly descants on <hi>Tertullians</hi>
  phrase wherein he mentions them to be holy, or till such time as they are holy
  indeed by that <hi>new birth</hi> from above; and Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> takes my
  part against the <hi>Doctor</hi> in this too saying they are in
  <hi>Tertullians</hi> sense <hi>designati sanctitatis</hi> i. e. as these words
  are expounded by the following, witnesse the <hi>Doctor</hi> himself, counted
  holy; but not <hi>Sancti</hi> i. e. not holy, till they be born of water, and
  the spirit p. 36. much lesse can I ever believe that he counted them holy and
  priviledged above others so far, as thereupon to assert them, or so much as to
  allow them to be baptized, for thats an utter in consequence of your own from
  <hi>Pauls</hi> text 1 Cor. 7. 14. and from <hi>Tertullians</hi> text to, who
  though he take <hi>Pauls</hi> speech of such childrens holinesse a little the
  wrong way, yet wrests them not so far out of the way to the proof of such a
  popish practise as you do, yea there is not a little in <hi>Tertullians</hi>
  testimony you so talk of, that tends at all to testifie the truth of infant
  baptism; indeed had the <hi>Epithet</hi> given by <hi>Tertullian sidelium
  filiis</hi> been so as that instead of that phrase, wherein he saies they ought
  to be <hi>designati sanctitatis et salutis</hi> i. e. reputatively holy and
  happy ones, he had said they should be <hi>signati sanctitatis, &amp;
  salutis</hi> i. e. signed, in your own phrase, sealed ones of holinesse and
  happinesse, there had been some hint towards baptism, but as tis there is none
  at all of such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The Dr. draws neck and heels together to make
  <hi>Tertullian</hi> speak to his mind, but twill appear he was of another mind
  then he, as to the baptism of any infants when all is done. for saith he</p>

                  <hi>Tertullian shews childrens capacity of grace and

               <p>

               <p>This is your inference Mr. Dr. from which inference of yours,
  now we talk of inferring, Ile infer two things by way of quaere, and so let it
  passe <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, if the seales <hi>in plurall,</hi> marke your words
  therefore both at least, yet both are but signs neither in true locution, must
  both follow the right of the inheritance of which children are in capacity as
  well as men, then to fill you with your own phrase, why is not one seal of the
  same inheritance, of the same salvation given to infants by you, as well as the
  other? i. e. the supper as well as baptism?</p>
               <p>Secondly, if these <hi>in plurali,</hi> or if no more then
  baptism be to be given to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren consequently upon no more then capacity of
  salvation, the capacities of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being equal, and they <hi>quoad nos</hi>
  all alike capable to enjoy it, if God, who is neither bound nor barred, please
  to bestow salvation, why are not both these, or at least that one sign of
  baptism, which <hi>you</hi> give to some infants, given by you to all infants
  as well as some? i. e. to ungodly mens children as well as to those of godly
  parents? the Dr. strives with all his strength and straines one point more 
  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:42067:117"/> yet to strain <hi>Tertullians</hi> testimony to his
  turn, yet will it not do in any wise.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Babist.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertullian in that text mentions not onely childrens being
  holy, but he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions also that place Iohn 3. 4. in relation to children,
  except a man be born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of water and of the spirit &amp;c. from which we
  may perceive that</hi> Tertullian <hi>grounds infants baptism upon
  Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Baptist.</head>
               <p>To which first supposing that by that birth of water, and the
  spirit is meant nothing but baptism in that place of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> we
  are yet upon, I reply.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thus <hi>viz.</hi> appealing to the Drs own
  conscience, and Mr. <hi>Marshals</hi> also, whether he speak that very clause
  of Scripture in that very place of his we are now upon to that very intent, as
  to ground infant baptism upon it, or whether if it be read with a right and
  true <hi>Emphasis,</hi> and reference, it doth not of the two ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suppose
  it was not to be in infancy? for having (as Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> understands)
  confessed so far of infants of the faithful, that they are <hi>designati
  sanctitatis, et salutis</hi> i. e. to be held in the mean time (to wit) in
  childhood, and before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, as holy and happy reputatively only, yet he
  saies that none of all them are <hi>sancti</hi> i. e. holy indeed (for that we
  see is <hi>Tertullians</hi> sense of the word enter into the kingdom) unlesse
  they be born of water and the spirit, that is (as I conceive) till they be
  converted and baptized, which thing that it is at all to the infants of the
  faithful in their minority he saith not at all here, nor any thinglike it, but
  elsewhere, mentioning the same Scripture <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. as he puts the
  water and the spirit together, so both before and behind it, he puts teaching
  and dipping, faith and baptism as things that by the law of dipping are imposed
  as of necessity to go together, saying <hi>he hath bound faith to the necessity
  of baptism, therefore all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> (speaking of none else) <hi>were
  baptized, and then</hi> Paul <hi>when he believed was baptized, in his
  book</hi> de baptismo advers. <hi>Quintil. Editio de la. cerda. vol. 2. p. 153.
  ibid. c. 13. as Mr.</hi> Blackwood <hi>quotes him in his storm of Antichrist
  p.</hi> 28. 29. so that in the quotation were are yet upon the
  <hi>Antithesis</hi> lies thus in my conscience as I read him <hi>viz.</hi>
  infants of the faithful in their infancy may be <hi>reputatively holy,</hi> but
  not <hi>really holy,</hi> none being <hi>really holy</hi> till such time as
  they be born of water and the spirit, which was not in infancy in
  <hi>Tertullians</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, as it seems to me in that very place which
  the Dr. and Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> make so much of, as the words <hi>designati
  sanctitatis, non sancti</hi> do shew, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I perswade <hi>my</hi> self it
  was that in that other place of his, that I must return to, he uses disswasion
  from dispensing, and perswasion to deferring baptism to all, but specially to
  infants, not of infidels onely, but believers also, as I shall shew clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to
  Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> now, who scruples it, and that by such reasons as shall
  take that rub and stumbling block of his out of the way (I mean this last text
  of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> of his own and Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> his alleading) by
  which <hi>they</hi> were both gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from believing <hi>Tertullian</hi> to
  be ours, for indeed whereas that place he last al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged did give him supposed
  ground to scruple whether <hi>Tertullians</hi> disswasion from baptizing of
  infants were from <hi>any,</hi> but the infants of infidels, I hope to shew him
  such a necessity of understanding his disswasion to be from the baptism of any
  infants whatsoever, as shall give him contrarily sure ground of belief, that
  howbeit <hi>Tertullian</hi> would have some infants higher accounted on then
  some, yet he would not from thence have any baptized: to which end I shall set
  down <hi>Tertullians</hi> disswasions of infant baptism in English, as I find
  them quoted by Mr, <hi>Marshall</hi> in latin, who (I observe) seldom Englishes
  what may make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him p. 34. of Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> against Mr.
  <hi>Tombes,</hi> and in p. 122. of Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> in English, and more
  largely then by either of them by Mr. <hi>Blackwood</hi> in his storm p. 29.
  together with the grounds why he would not have little ones baptized, and leave
  it to be judged what little ones he means. <hi>Tertullians</hi> words are these
  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:42067:117"/> 
                  <hi>According to every ones condition,
  and disposition, and age, the delay of baptism is more profitable, but
  especially concerning little children, for what necessity is there (if it be
  not so much a necessity) as to have the sureties also brought into danger? who
  may both by their own mortallity fail of fulfilling their promises, and by the
  increase of an ill disposition be deceived. The Lord saith indeed forbid them
  not to come unto me, let them come therefore when they grow up to youth,
  &amp;c. thus far Mr.</hi> Marshal <hi>and the Dr. Mr.</hi> Blackwood writes
  further thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let them come whilst they are young, whilst wherein they
  come they are taught, let them become Christians when they know
  Christ:—</hi>a little further he saith, <hi>shall it be done more warily
  insecular things, that to whom earthly substance is not committed Divine should
  be committed? they sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ll know to
  beg salvation, that thou mayst seem to give it to him that asketh it,</hi> al
  so in the 20 chapter of the same book he saith, <hi>it behoves them that are
  about to enter into baptism, to pray with frequent prayers, fastings, kneeling,
  and watchings, and with the confession of their sins past,</hi> in all these
  words, is he recorded by the three authors above named, disswading from
  baptizing infants: now whereas Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi> professes he stands much
  inclined to believe that these little ones to whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> would
  have baptism delayed are to be interpreted of the infants of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels onely;
  and Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> helps him what he can in this, by quoting the words of
  learned <hi>Iunim</hi> upon the place, who is just of the same opinion with Mr.
  <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall,</hi> yet lends him as little reason towards it as one can likely
  look for from so rational a man, I shall immind them first, that
  <hi>Vossius</hi> on the place quoted by Dr. <hi>Holmes,</hi> in one and the
  same page with <hi>Iunius,</hi> found no good ground to evade the bang
  <hi>Tertullian</hi> gives to infant baptism in such a fashion, as to say he
  denies onely the baptism of infidels infants; how far you will heed him I know
  not, but he thinks his think thus, <hi>viz. not that infants of the faithful
  are here denied by</hi> Tertullian, <hi>but that nothing is denied by him but
  onely the necessity of these infants baptism, when theres no danger of death,
  because tis said what ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity? (if there be no necessity)</hi> defend you
  your selves if you will, against that consenr (by silence) of <hi>Vossius</hi>
  to us in this, that tis all infants to whom <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> would have
  baptism delaied (for that affronts your poor put off) and Ile look to
  <hi>Vossius</hi> his own put off as well as I can, that he shall not go clear
  away with it, for my own part then allowing <hi>Vossius</hi> his own thought, I
  take the like liberty to think otherwise, and the boldnesse to assert the
  contrary <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Tertullian</hi> denies more then a necessity of
  infant baptism, yea he denies any <hi>conveniency or lawfullnesse</hi> of the
  thing also, especially in the testimony cited by Mr. <hi>Blackwood,</hi> which
  the Dr. and Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> durst not mention, and clearly enough in those
  cited by themselvs, for if it behoves them that are baptized to pray, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
  sin &amp;c. which no infant can do, then it behoves us not to baptize them, and
  if it bring sureties into danger then tis not convenient nor expedient, as well
  as not necessary, and if it be more profitable to delay it to infants, then we
  are so by duty bound to do whats most profitable, and edifying, that to do
  otherwise is to do that which is unlawful: moreover it being granted, by
  <hi>Vossius</hi> that <hi>Tertullian</hi> denies but so much as the necessity
  of baptizing any infants, Ile prove thence a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity not to baptize any, for
  if there be not more or lesse a necessity of one kind or other <hi>viz. vel
  praecepti vel medii,</hi> theres a necessity at least of letting it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, for
  Christ commands no ordinance of his without need, and with such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
  as destroyes all necessity of obeying it, and what way or point of worship was
  not ordained by himself, is by command from him of such necessity to be
  de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, that as he who preaches it (though an <hi>Angell</hi> from heaven)
  is to be held accursed, so he that doth thereafter shall have no thank for his
  labor, for in vain do they worship him, that either teach, or take for
  doctrines the traditions of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:42067:118"/> Secondly, and further to prove it, least
  Mr. <hi>Marshal</hi> and the Dr. should not grant <hi>Vossius</hi> that
  <hi>Tertullians</hi> denial is of the baptism of all infants, even of
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as well as infidels, I argue that more plainly.</p>
               <p>First from the universallity of the expression of himself in his
  disswasion, which extends to all manner of persons without exception; for it
  may be thought he was somewhat soiled with that superstition, which was rife in
  after ages <hi>viz.</hi> that baptism was best dispensed towards the end of a
  mans life, that he might have a sign of the forgivnesse of all his sinnes at
  once, whereupon <hi>Tertullian</hi> would not have unmarried persons baptized
  until temptation was over, so far was as he from desiring such early
  dispensation of baptism as that to infants, I say his perswasion to delay it
  extends to all manner of persons, and therefore to the infants of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as
  well as to other little ones.</p>
               <p>Secondly, his indefinit and indifferent expression of these
  little ones concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which he speaks, for (saith he) <hi>specially about
  little ones,</hi> promiscuously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all, excepting none, as it had bin
  necessary for him to do if he would be understood to speak but of some, and not
  of others: for if Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> should preach or write his opinion
  against the baptism of unbelievers children onely. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to himself his
  present earnestnesse for the baptism of other little ones, and deliver himself
  downrightly and indifinitely thus onely, in way of dissawsion <hi>viz.</hi> I
  would not by any means have little one baptized, I find no ground
  <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zare parvulos</hi> to baptize infants &amp;c. so running on and never
  distinguishing, so as to say in that sermon or speech, I mean onely infants of
  infidels, I should not take him for so judicious a man as I yet hold him to be,
  saving his holding so stif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly still for infant baptism.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by the reason he gives why he would not have little
  ones baptized <hi>viz.</hi> least their sureties should be in hazzard of
  non-performance of their words, by reason of their own death, or their <hi>God
  childrens</hi> untowardnesse, which dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may come as well by baptism of
  believers infants as of others: As whose <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,</hi> whether
  <hi>fathers</hi> or <hi>mothers,</hi> or <hi>God-fathers</hi> and
  <hi>God-mothers</hi> may die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they grow up, or if they live, be
  frustrated of their ends by the wickednesse of these children, or god-children
  also.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in that he speaks of such children of whom the Lord
  said forbid them not to come unto me, which in the Priesthoods own sense at
  least are believers children, yea and them onely, by which clause according to
  you he may seem to speak of them onely, rather then of infidels childrens
  onely, whom you your selves forbid to be brought to Christ at all.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, in that he saies let them become Christians when they
  know Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like then, if your sense be true, some Infants may be
  warrantably enough made Christians before they know Christ, but some infants
  again may not at any hand be made Christians till they know Christ, which if it
  were <hi>Tertulliaus</hi> meaning, as tis yours, he might mean honestly in it
  (as you do) but tis too mean an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to keep touch with the word, which
  never knew any way but one, wherein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples and Christians were made, i. e.
  of profest faith, repentance and baptism, after they knew Christ by the
  preaching of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, in that he saies we should be more wary then to commit
  Divine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to them, to whom earthly substance is not committed, now we
  know that earthly substance can be no more wisely committed to infants of
  believers in their non age then to <hi>infants of infidels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, by one end why he would have them be capable to beg
  salvation first, <hi>viz.</hi> that God may seem to give it to them that ask
  it, which end is destroyed, if baptism be dispensed to believers infants in
  infancy, for they can no more ask it then the infants of unbelievers.</p>
               <p>Eightly, because he saies it behoves them, indifinitely (meaning
  all them) that enter into baptism to pray and confesse sin, &amp;c. which
  conditions are as exclusive <pb n="223" facs="tcp:42067:118"/> of all infants as of some,
  those of believers being no more capable to do that then infants of infidels
  are.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, what ever children he disswaded from the baptizing of
  here (and so saith Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake)</hi> its most
  evident <hi>de facto</hi> that they were wont to be baptized then, or else
  there had been no object of his diswasion, therefore if his advice to delay to
  them, were concerning infants of infidels, then its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that in
  <hi>Tertullians</hi> time twas the custome to baptize infidels infants as well
  as Christians, and so if antiquity of infant baptism were an argument of its
  goodnes, its as good an argument of the goodness of baptizing infidels infants
  also, which with you is well-nigh as bad as the other is good.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Babist.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>True</hi> de facto <hi>we have evidence that the baptism of
  infidels infants then was, but that fathers disswading from it is an argument
  that twas nought and though crept in yet a thing that was not so from the
  beginning.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Baptist.</head>
               <p>Then I hope, if ever you come to be perswaded, and it is a
  wonder that none of the reasons above be cogent, that twas indeed from
  baptizing of any children at all that <hi>Tertullian</hi> diswaded, we have an
  argument of your own for it that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of any mens infants is naught
  also, and a thing that was not so from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and so if Mr.
  <hi>Marshall</hi> himself be not by this time sick of <hi>Tertullian</hi> I
  assure both him and you all that I am, and of all the Fathers also, with whom
  in this controversie I would not have meddled, but that your Pamphlet flutters
  so so with naming the Fathers; and takes it ill that testimonies from the
  Fathers were not taken on the day of the Ashford disputation: I say again I am
  sick of them, not so much with fear at the sight of any thing in any of them,
  that makes against us, for I find nothing that hath the strength of a straw
  against our way throughout them all, even these few <hi>Iunior, inferior</hi>
  ones themselves, that are most against us, for the <hi>Seniors</hi> are more
  fully on our sides, and some of the <hi>Iunior</hi> ones also, as
  <hi>Basil,</hi> and <hi>Chrisostome,</hi> both in the fourth Century, whose
  words, as Mr <hi>Blakwood</hi> cites them p. 28, 29. of his storm, are thus
  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First he ought to believe, and after to be sealed with
  baptism,</hi> and <hi>if any one have not corrected the transgression of his
  manners, and hath not made vertue easie to himself, let him not be
  baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which words are exclusive of infants, tis not therefore any
  disadvantage that comes by them to our cause, which I am sick of, But</p>
               <p>First, with spending so much time, and searching so much into
  their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies (as you have compelled me to do) that me thinks I am out of
  my element, where I desire to be, i. e. the Scriptures, whet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>er Ile return by and by (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling)
  especially this last testimony of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which yet I could not
  help unless I would for want of help betray the truth, when I saw how Mr.
  <hi>Marshal,</hi> Dr. <hi>Holmes,</hi> and others had almost stolen away
  corrupted and by fair words en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed our old friend <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to
  serve on their side, for we would not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be cousi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ed of what is our due: yet least any man should think
  of me above that he seeth me to be, and take me to be a man of much reading,
  because I talk so much of the Fathers, I testify that I am of little further
  acquaintance with these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for my converse is mostly with <hi>Matthew,
  Mark, Luke, Peter, Paul, Iude Ianies,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> then this
  controversie hath brought me to, which now is so much that though I honor them,
  as honest and good men in their times, as find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many things of much worth,
  and excellency in them, yet for all that I am sick,</p>
               <p>Secondly, with seeing what abundance of absurdities, silly
  reasons, senselesse anti-scriptural sentences, odd conceits, vanities,
  varieties of error, as well as verities, uncertainties whether some of their
  books be their own or no, mistrans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <pb n="224" facs="tcp:42067:119"/> foisting of
  what of their own other men please into their works as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> into
  <hi>Origen,</hi> falsities, flat contradictions amongst themselves, and such
  like are to be found among them, sufficient enough to cause all men to trust no
  more to their testimonies, then with their own eyes they see the same testifyed
  in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I am sick more yet to find the whole Clergy after whom
  the whole world wonders, and walks in error, wondring so much after these
  Fathers, and walking after them, where they walk in error, and yet neglecting
  to give heed to them where they speak the truth, and which is worst of all,
  sleighting the short pure, and plain waies of God, the Father of all, of
  <hi>Christ</hi> our Father, and the first Fathers next and immediately under
  God and Christ, Supreme Governors of the Church, and givers out of the Gospel
  to the world, I mean the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who in my mind write the way of the
  Gospel, if men were not willing to go astray from it, because it is narrow,
  self denying, and thorny, though more briefly yet more clearly to any common
  capacity, then the most voluminous of all the other fathers do, for we use all
  plainess of speech saies <hi>Paul 2 Cor.</hi> 3. Wherefore</p>
               <p>Fourthly, and Lastly I am sick most of all to consider, what a
  stirr ministers make in their quotations of the Fathers, marching on, and
  giving such a broad side, as they think, with two or three sentences on of the
  fathers, as if they would bear all men down before them, that come near them,
  no higher read then in the Scriptures, no better armed then with the sword of
  the spirit, the word of God; For this only is dispised as much as
  <hi>Davids</hi> sling and stone before <hi>Goliah,</hi> and this too, though in
  coole bloud the Scripture is confessed by themselves to be so <hi>instar
  omnium,</hi> that nothing is of any force, but what slowes from it: for though
  some <hi>Clergy men</hi> dote so far that they believe the Fathers, no
  otherwise then they would have the world to believe themselves, i. e. because
  <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> yet some are so wise as to confesse, that how far forth
  soever the Fathers may serve to prove to us things <hi>de facto</hi> to be done
  in their several ages, yet their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes <hi>de facto</hi> cannot prove
  any thing to us to be <hi>de jure</hi> at all, whereas if it be so, and ye so
  it is, I am me thinks become a fool at this time in falling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was
  aware, so up to the ears in contest about a few testimonies of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as
  well as I and others heretofore, in counting so extraordinarily on them:
  wherefore I do henceforth humbly conceive, and confess my self to the people,
  to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all my fellow <hi>father-fool'd</hi> friends, <hi>viz.</hi> the
  <hi>Clergy</hi> of all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to have been no better then
  <hi>childish</hi> and <hi>semi-simple</hi> so far as such high and holy heed,
  and such heedlesse submission hath been given by us to these fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
  Schoolmen, and other authors, as hath occasioned extreme seduction from the
  Scriptures: hear therefore O thou most miserably be wildred Priesthood of the
  Nations, and understand, for so thou shalt if thou return from out of that
  thick wood of <hi>Authors, Polemical Tracts, Schoolmen, Casuists, Tomes,
  Volumes of Fathers, Councels, Commentators, Treatises, Systemes of Theology,
  fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forms of old and New Creeds, long and short Catechismes, confessions of
  Churches, &amp;c.</hi> in which thou hast wandred and lost thy self from the
  truth, to the unfeigned study of that little book of Scriptures, which alone,
  if thou wilt be admonished by it, is able to make thee, and them that hear thee
  wise enough unto salvation: Thou speakest what thou hast seen of thy fathers we
  speak what we have seen of our Fathers: what thine teach in their books, we
  regard not <hi>quâ ipsi dixerint,</hi> unless <hi>quâ dictum
  prius</hi> by our Fathers, if they teach no other then what our Fathers teach
  in theirs, it is no more then what thou, having the same Scripture, the same
  liberty, to search, the same promise of the same spirit to guide, the same
  accesse to God in prayer for it, mayest learn, not at second hand from them,
  but at first hand from thence, as easily as themselves, but when they go aside,
  from that, and thou with them, and thine with thee a venture, this seems no
  other to me then <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> with a false flash going before, and
  <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus <pb n="225" facs="tcp:42067:119"/> fatuus</hi> with his false faith, and a
  number of ignorants following after.</p>
               <p>Thou tellest us of thy novel antiquity of Counsels,
  <hi>National, Oecumenicall,</hi> of Churches <hi>Greek and Latin,</hi> of
  Fathes, <hi>Austin, Gregory,</hi> &amp;c. and yet confessest thy self that
  <hi>particular Churches have erred, and may erre,</hi> and if all particulars,
  then why the universal, which consists of all particulars cannot, thou canst
  not prove, and that <hi>generall councels, which the School-men term the
  representative Church, are subject to error. and have sometimes decreed heresie
  and falshood for truth,</hi> thou confessest by Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> p. 17. of
  his figment; And that <hi>none of the fathers, nor yet the joint consent of
  many is a competent judge for faith to hang upon, concerning the right of
  things,</hi> is confest by Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> p. 58. of his to Mr.
  <hi>Blackwood,</hi> and yet (to go round again) thou ventest thy self out of
  the mouthes of others, as if their verdict were enough to warrant, and canonize
  all that for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that is vented by them.</p>
               <p>Tell us therefore no more (as Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> doth) of
  <hi>Gregory</hi> nor yet of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the great,</hi> whose testimonies if

  of all before the first, tis evident that <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> was for

  any more for thee, then they are against thee they could make nothing for thee,
  as to evince the equity of thy cause.</p>
               <p>As for our way of baptism, if it were our way onely, we trust we
  should be against it our selves, but sith it is the onely way of that word, by
  which all works must be tried, and all persons judged, whose authority alone
  being absolutely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, <hi>if it were of any esteem with the adversaries
  thereof, were enough to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence their disputes</hi> against it, it will stand
  though never so many <hi>Councels</hi> and things which thou callest
  <hi>Churches,</hi> and a 1000 <hi>Gregories</hi> were against it.</p>
               <p>By this time you may see O ye <hi>Ashford Synodians!</hi> how
  little ground you would have gotten by it if the Authorities of the Church of
  God from the beginning, and the fathers of both that and after ages had been

  <hi>you</hi> so stand upon, are nothing for <hi>you.</hi>

  headings, hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, pinching with hot pincers, stabbings, and such like wayes
  whereby the self-preserving common-wealth of <hi>Clergy men,</hi> that they
  might testifie their cause by the <hi>Neronean cruelty</hi> of it, to be of
  Christ, who in the 9th chapter of just no where, charges all his ministers to
  impower all Christian magistrates to imprison, spoil, torment, hang, banish,
  burn, drown, whip, fine, flea and destroy all such, as <hi>in foro hominum
  Synodicantium, non Dei,</hi> deny his name, have restored those that have to
  their offence been overtaken with the fault of unfeigned faith, and true
  obedience in the spirit of meekness, in all ages of their reign.</p>
               <p>So that if either fear, or fire, or blood, or water were
  sufficient, there hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto wanted none of all these to suffocate the
  disputers, to lay the itch and quench the heat of disputes against infant
  baptism: but as the hast of these times wherein God begins to find the
  magistrates othor work viz. to curb the Christian cruelty of that whore, that
  hath thus rid them into rigor against the Saints, doth forbid the the ministers
  to be so throughly provided with them as heretofore, so modesty doth to use
  those knocking arguments now in these times of <hi>Orthodozism,</hi> where in
  both the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and their bloody tenet of persecution for cause of
  conscience, are discovered dayly in their colours.</p>
               <p>How little then the Authorities of <hi>fathers</hi> and
  <hi>Churches,</hi> in case we grant them to come in thereunto, can contribute
  to your assistance is apparent, and now that those modern authors you promise
  your Reader such through furniture from <hi>viz. Calvin, Ursin, and
  Featley</hi> upon this subject, and also such others, as (though you name them
  not here yet) have improved themselves more singularly on that single subject,
  then any of these have done, as little help you, if they be well heeded, I come
  now in the fourth place to discover.</p>
               <p>And first, as for your worthy Dr. <hi>Featley,</hi> he is so
  worthily defeated and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed of all his Artillery by Mr. <hi>Denn,</hi> that
  it were but to attempt the stripping of a naked, and encountring of a wounded
  man, to meddle much more with his arguments, which are all sufficiently
  secured, and disabled from doing much mischief to the true baptism; onely for
  his high charges of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> (as he calls them) as a
  <hi>bloudy, illiterate, lascivious, lying, sacrilegious</hi> s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  be made good against the Clergy in general, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the generallity of
  them he calls so, may possibly be examined hereafter.</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Calvin and Ursin,</hi> tis true they are both
  against us in the maine, but in some things so slatly against you in the mean,
  that you have as little cause <pb n="227" facs="tcp:42067:120"/> to brag of their
  assistance of you, as the <hi>Kirk</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> had to blesse

  of persons at years, not of infants, for such must be taught first, but that
  hinders not but that infants may be baptized before teaching: and this is the

  command for infants to come, should answer thus <hi>viz.</hi> theres no mention
  at all of children in that text, much lesse any prohibition of infants to come,
  when <hi>Paul</hi> saies, let a man examine himself, he speaks of persons at
  years onely, but that hinders not why infants may not come without
  self-examination, would you not <pb n="232" facs="tcp:42067:123"/> say I were half out of
  my wits? yet thus do you all almost (as well concerning places of your own
  assigning, as those we bring <hi>viz. Mat. 28. Mark. 16. 16. Act.</hi> 2.
  Repent and be baptized <hi>Act.</hi> 8. if thou believest thou maiest) return
  thus <hi>viz.</hi> those phrases speak of adult ones, and not of infants; and
  so say I of these and every Scripture else that speaks of baptism, and I trow
  where is that place that makes mention of any such thing as the baptism of
  infants?</p>
               <p>Secondly, in president of which you send us to the housholds,
  wherein your selves cannot tell that there was any infant therein at all: which
  is as much as to say and urge <hi>(ab exemplo)</hi> thus <hi>viz.</hi> tis not
  certain by any one instance thereof, that any one infant was baptized in those
  housholds, which are said to be baptized in the primitive times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> no doubt but by the same example infants ought to
  be baptized now.</p>
               <p>Again, some of you urge <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. as the institution of
  Christ for baptizing men of ripe years at least, yea and in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ants also (as Mr. <hi>Marshall)</hi>
  some of you again deny this, saying that <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. is not an exact
  platform of Christs commission concerning the matter of subject of the
  administration of baptism (as Dr. <hi>Holms</hi> p. 7.) both which men direct
  their different doctrines to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> in order to his direction: but
  how shall that man be resolved? which shall he cleave to? whose words shall he
  take, the <hi>Doctors</hi> or the <hi>Divines?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, some of you say, that <hi>semen carnis</hi> a fleshly
  seed is intituled to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, (for even this seed with you is <hi>emen
  sidei)</hi> some of you say <hi>semen sidei</hi> the spiritual seed onely: i.
  e. <hi>as many as are of the faith</hi> (and so saith the Scripture) <hi>are
  blessed with faithfull</hi> Abraham, but then <hi>semen sidei</hi> with you is
  no other but <hi>semen carnis</hi> the fleshly seed, and that of such too, as
  are <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, not after the flesh, nor after the faith neither:
  thus you wander in a wood, and trace too and fro in a thicket, moap up and down
  in a myst, are rapt up in a cloud of confusion, contradiction and
  unanswerablenesse about the proof of a popish pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, dancing round, and
  crossing the way one of another ever and anon, and yet ken it not, nor consider
  how all mens eyes, that are but half open, are half ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at your
  shufles.</p>
               <p>Again, some of you pin your practise upon the score of the
  infants faith, and of these aga in there are several <hi>subdivisions,</hi> for
  some ground it on <hi>seminall</hi> faith onely i. e. the habit, or on infants
  having faith, denying utterly their capacity to act it i. e. to believe (as Mr.
  <hi>Willcock</hi> and many more.)</p>
               <p>Some again deny that they do build it upon <hi>seminall</hi>
  faith, but say they go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more certain grounds as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> p. 24.
  to Mr. <hi>Blackwood,</hi> who faith of faith in the root, or of this
  <hi>semniall</hi> faith, <hi>this faith is not our ground for infants baptism,
  being undiscernable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some again upon their acting faith, which they assert infants
  capable to do (though against their wills) as well as to have it, as (to the
  clear contradiction of themselves) Mr. <hi>Willcock,</hi> and many more do,
  whilst they with him, and he with them speak of children in this phrase
  <hi>viz.</hi> that they do believe, and thus they speak whilest they interpret
  that clause <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 6. i. e. <hi>these little ones which believe in
  me,</hi> of little ones littterally taken, for <gap reason="foreign">

  not the habit onely, but the <hi>act</hi> of faith, as <hi>to know, to read, to

  onely, but <hi>actum secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> also.</p>
               <p>Some of you again put that practise upon score of the
  <hi>parents</hi> faith, not the <hi>childs,</hi> and of these, which are also
  subdivided, some the faith of the <hi>next parents</hi> onely, as Dr
  <hi>Holmes,</hi> who in his to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> p. 216. 217. saith thus,
  <hi>the children are not to be baptized whilst the next parents are
  unbelievers</hi> i. e. though the grand parents be believers, and Mr.
  <hi>Cotton</hi> also, who p. 87. of his book sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the way of the Churches of
  <hi>New England</hi> saith thus, <hi>God never allowed his Church any warrant
  to receive into Covenant the children of godly parents, who 
  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:42067:123"/> lived a thousand years ago, nay rather the text is plain
  that the holynesse of the childrend pendeth upon the faith of the next
  immediate parents, or one of them at least,</hi> as if the seed of parents were
  not their seed at two or three gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations off; others the faith of the remote
  parents, as Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> Pres. p. 164 where he saith, <hi>all
  infants born in the visible Church, what ere the wickednesse of the neerest
  parents is, are to be received into the Church by baptism: yea</hi> p. 173
  Joshua <hi>had commandement of God to give the seal of the Covenant to their
  children, who were as openly wicked against the Lord, as murderers, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erds,
  swearers</hi> &amp;c. also Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baily</hi> who
  commends Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> learned maintenance of infants sprinkling in p.
  132, and yet contradicts him in this thing, no further off then p. 134. saying,
  <hi>although the parents are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> (meaning the immediate parents)
  <hi>yet the Lords interest is in the children i. e, not of the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and</hi>

  and the whole world are of <hi>Noah,</hi> though not of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and
  so belike must be baptized, and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> in p. 24. of his

                     </gap>ot the faith of his immediate
  parents, but the promise made to Ancestors in the faith, whose seed is though
  at a greater distance, then the loose life of an im mediate parent can be no

  viz. from p. 79. to p. 100.</p>
               <p>Some again put the practise of infant baptism upon the score of
  neither the childs not the <hi>fathers</hi> faith necessarily, but on the faith

  born here, were Christned by the Priests, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>I baptize thee</hi> when

  they should by right baptize the <hi>sponsors</hi> professing their faith and

  a child, of what parents it matters not, out of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes arms, putting two
  or three drops of water upon the face of it, and so theres an end of the
  business: this is that which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> the great <hi>Gamaliel</hi> of
  <hi>New England,</hi> though after that fashion possibly himself was sprinkled,
  is now ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and bitterly against, professing for himself and those Churches
  p. 88. of his way of the Church of <hi>new England, that they know not any
  ground at all to allow a faithful man liberty to entitle another mans child to
  baptism, upon the pretence of his own promise to have an e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

  his house, or resigned to him to be brought up as his own,</hi> and then he is
  confident, but from no other law then that of circumcision, from which I may be
  as confident that males onely, and that on the eighth day, must be baptized, it
  may be done. Some upon the faith of the <hi>sureties</hi> or
  <hi>guardians,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> who from Gen. 17 12. 13. grants,
  but very doubtfully, and therefore whether damnably or <pb n="234" facs="tcp:42067:124"/>
  no let him look to it) so much liberty to a Christian <hi>Sponsor, i. e.
  Surety,</hi> that <hi>if a stranger, or a very wicked man should give him his
  child from his infancy, to be brought up as his own, it may be baptized as his
  own,</hi> in confutation of which ile quote no Author but Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi>
  who in that same 88. page, where he speaks this; but two or three lines above
  it saies thus, <hi>The Covenant is not intailed to Sureties, i. e. to such for
  whom they undertake,</hi> but this is the utmost bounds of liberty Mr.
  <hi>Cotton</hi> saies he can give, and I wonder who gave him pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give so
  much in this case, he allowes a little bit and no more, because he is not sure
  he may allow that, but (by his leave) from that inch ile take an ell, for if a
  wicked mans child may be baptized, then it may, and then why not a 100 as well
  as one, in the like case? and so at least the promise is not entailed to
  faithful parents only, and their sced, yea his grant p. 88. intailes baptism to
  the children that have believing <hi>Guardians,</hi> as well as to such as have
  believing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and so he gives the question, as stated concerning
  believers children on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Some again put it on the score of neither the childs, nor the
  <hi>parents,</hi> nor the <hi>sponsors</hi> faith, but at least either the
  fathers, or the Mothers <hi>membership</hi> in a gathered Church, so as if this
  be not the parents, though otherwise never so faithful may not have their
  children baptized: thus the Churches in <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> yea and I think
  all of this indifferent <hi>semi-demi-Independent</hi> way, both in <hi>Old
  England,</hi> and <hi>New,</hi> and elsewhere, witness Mr. <hi>Best Churches
  plea</hi> p. 60, 61. who saith thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A man must not only be a Christian, and by profession,
  within the covenant only, but also a member of some visible Church, and
  particular congregation ere his child be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For which Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> rounds him a bout again, and
  takes him to do, p. 174. 175. of his <hi>Presb.</hi> and flatly contradicts him
  thus, saying,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baptism is a priviledge of the Church, not of such a
  particular Independent Church, and the distinction between Christian communion,
  and Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in this point is needless, and fruitless, for none are to
  be refused bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism whose parents professe the faith, &amp;c. howbeit not
  members of a settled Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which also contradicts Mr. <hi>Cobbets</hi> Castle of come down,
  whose whole stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is settled upon that same dainty distinction of
  <hi>Church choice,</hi> and <hi>true choice;</hi> of this mind also was my
  beloved friend Mr. <hi>Charles Nicolls,</hi> of whom I have more hopes yet then
  I have of every one of his own form, that he will fully own the truth in time,
  forasmuch as he doth more fully appear for it, against that
  <hi>Truth-destroying</hi> thing called <hi>Tythes,</hi> then those of his way
  do in other parts of <hi>Kent,</hi> who either <hi>per se,</hi> or at least
  <hi>per alios take</hi> them, not to say <hi>rake</hi> and <hi>rack</hi> both
  <hi>Christs flocks.</hi> and the <hi>parish flocks</hi> also for them still:
  which Mr. <hi>Nicolls</hi> preaching publiquely at <hi>Dover</hi> in my hearing
  <hi>Ian.</hi> 1650. (whether he fetch his doctrine out of Mr. <hi>Cobbets</hi>
  book yea or no I cannot tell, in page 17. whereof the same is found) declared
  himself to be of Mr. <hi>Cobbets</hi> mind by the delivery of this doctrine,
  <hi>viz. That an enchurcht believers natural seed is faederally holy</hi> from
  1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. which position I have also since seen under his hands,
  so narrow a corner is the case crouded into now, that it is not the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
  but the enchurcht belieuing parent, i, e. who, leaving the <hi>perochiall</hi>
  po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, betakes himself to <hi>membership</hi> in some seperated society, who
  sanctifies the unbelieving parent and the seed, else were the children unclean,
  but now are they holy, i. e. from the time of one or both parents entering the
  borders of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated society: and so by this means if an old man or woman
  that hath ten or twenty children, the youngest whereof is no less then twenty
  years old, they all though never so morally wicked, yet from thenceforth are
  faederally holy, but not before, no though their parents believed before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:42067:124"/> Upon this Account the Churches in <hi>New
  England</hi> deny their <hi>Nullity</hi> sprinkling to infants of such parents,
  as are either not yet joined to them, or (for which they are very oddly also at
  odds among themselves) <hi>excommunicate from them:</hi> in justification of
  which <hi>Gambole,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> lapps himself up in such a
  man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement of discourse p. 81. to the 88. as betokens, that wisdome is

  doors, unless I say he be contrary to all <hi>Paedobaptists,</hi> who hold
  baptism to be the way into the Church, and not the visible Church the way into
  baptism (and then what another cross whet doth he wipe them with) we must needs
  take Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in that manner, and yet to say the truth the
  <hi>Clergy</hi> is cross enough to themselves in this case, for this is but
  like that of them that say, believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are born in the bosome or within
  the pale of the Church, and so must be baptized, and must be baptized, and so
  enter within the pale of the visible Church, or else they are out, and in no

  which it is impossible to reconcile them till they have routed each other, and

               <p>By which kind of often interfearing of so able a man as Mr.

  come not to the perfection of it according to the word, the more miserably a
  great deal are they bewildred with any human tradition, that is remaining among
  them unremoved, in so much that the <hi>Papacy</hi> is lesse troubled with
  contradictions, quarrels, quirks and foolish quiddities about their infants
  sprinkling, then <hi>Praelacy, Praelacy</hi> then <hi>Presbytery,
  Presbytery</hi> then <hi>Independency:</hi> for though they hold none but
  believers, and that all those are to be baptized, yet the Pope carries it
  clearly to all infants born in his Christendom without streining, these being
  all believers with him, as in opposition to <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Prelate</hi> to the infants of <hi>Protestants</hi>
  onely, that are his believers, in opposition to <hi>Papists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>High-Presbyter</hi> to the infants of protestants
  universally, though with him not 10 of 100 in his parish are believers, when
  they administer the supper.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Independent</hi> to none but the infants of those that
  are inchurcht with him, though himself believes there are 1000s of believers
  that are not of his way: those I say that are most reformed in other things,
  are more muddled, and lesse capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintain that popish practise of
  infant-sprinkling, then those that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in all other parts of outward
  order besides it, and as they stand in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowest streit to hold it up, so
  are they for the most part at the nearest step to lay it down, not a few
  discovering dayly more and more the absurdity, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitablenesse of it to so
  pure a posture as they pretend to, and <hi>[quod fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri non debuit factum
  valet]</hi> availing more to the keeping off many from the true way of baptism,
  then any arguments they have, whereby to satisfie themselves in the sufficiency
  of that way of sprinkling.</p>
               <p>Thus we see what a laborinth you <hi>Clergy-men</hi> would lead
  poor creatures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if they should follow you, yea I know not how a man can
  follow you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he go nine wayes at once, such <hi>Noniformity</hi> there
  is among you, some saying this, and some that, and some you wot not well what
  your selves.</p>
               <p>What pretty <hi>Checker work</hi> is there in your judgements
  about one and the same thing? wherein you would be unanimous and uniform if you
  would return all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth.</p>
               <p>O how doth <hi>Babell</hi> come tumbling down by this
  <hi>Division</hi> of tongues, even as when theeves fall out, true men come to
  their goods, even so surely will the true Church come at last to the
  understanding of this truth, even that no infants at all are to be sprinkled,
  when they shall see what a do there is about it among di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and how they
  would hold it if they could tell how, and say something for it if they could
  tell what; the <hi>disputers</hi> and <hi>scribes</hi> will scuffle one with
  another till their poor people, not knowing which to follow, will at last
  betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to leave them all, and follow Christ.</p>
               <p>What Sirs is the Gospel, the plain simple gospel, such a
  <hi>maeander</hi> as this? is Christ thus divided? were <hi>Paul, Peter,</hi>
  and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles and
  ministers, whose Successors you all say you are, but are not in very deed, so
  intricately intangled in vain janglements about one and the same que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, as
  you are both among and within your selves, so that your answers and 
  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:42067:125"/> Accounts for your practise hang together more

  the most part of you removed your hearts far from him; and your <hi>fear
  to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him is taught after the precepts of men, therefore are ye drunken, but
  not with wine, you stagger, but not with strong drink, for the Lord hath
  powered upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, you
  Prophets, you Rulers, you Seers hath he covered;</hi> you have disserted the
  truth, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into a counterfeit kind of Baptism, that never
  descended from above, that hath stood now of a long time <hi>jure
  Ecclesiastico,</hi> but not <hi>jure Christico,</hi> and so the best of you
  know not how to hold it, now the truth returns from the land of her captivity,
  without fidling, and faining, and patching, and shifting, and such shameful
  ridiculous thwarting of your selves, and one another with yea and nay in your
  joint prosecution of one and the same cause as will, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not in
  time, object as much to the <hi>Ha-Ha-He</hi> of that part of the Christian
  world, that yet wonders after you of the protestant Clergy, as other popish
  toies have done the <hi>Papacy</hi> to the <hi>Pape</hi> of such as once
  wondered after them; give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver therefore your dabling of infants faces, and
  baptize believers by profession, cast away all your wood, hay; and stubble,
  which cannot endure the trial by the light of that day, that is now
  approaching, and begin the Gospel again as it was in the beginning, is now, and

  Fathers</hi> are (though some against you, some for you) so little to be
  regarded in their testimonies, in respect of the Superstition of their times,
  that if they were all wholly for you they prove nothing <hi>de jure</hi> (as
  neither do the testimonies of the more antient Fathers by Mr.
  <hi>Marshalls</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> confession) that though the
  <hi>Clergy,</hi> and all <hi>Christendome, Pope, Civil powers,</hi> and
  <hi>people</hi> have been so fully for you for ages together, as that they have
  persecuted all that have been against you, yet this shewes the badness of your
  cause by the bloudiness of it, and so makes more against then for you; that two
  of those three Authors of your own alledging are as much for you, as men can be
  that are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to you, for they (as ignorantly as your selves) own your
  practise, though they disown, and overturn one or two of the prime pillars, and
  grounds you pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice from: that the third, <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Featley,</hi>
  is killed as dead as a door-nayle by Mr. <hi>Den,</hi> and that your selves,
  and the other sticklers that still stand up in your cause, are so miserably
  imbroiled in civil wars, divisions, diversities of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to bring about the
  same thing, contradictions, clashings, <hi>Ayes,</hi> and <hi>Noes</hi> among
  your selves, that you can never make an handsome head against the truth, till
  your matters hang more harmoniously together: so that nought remaines in which
  you can hope, (unlesse your self excusing, quarter crying Epistle to the
  Reader, which is also answered, can stead you) but your forlorn hope of these
  three following Arguments, which are more then half laid sprawling already, and
  that <hi>tottered troop,</hi> and <hi>ragged Regiment</hi> of

               <p>
                  <hi>The First is taken from the universall practise of the
  Church of God, which the Adversaries would not hear of at the Disputation. The
  grounds of it are expresse texts of Scripture, Mat.</hi> 28. 20. Lo I am with
  you alway to the end of the world. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 16. The Comforter shall
  abide with you for ever. <hi>ver.</hi> 17. The spirit of truth. <hi>ver.</hi>
  26. Who shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance
  which I have told you. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16. 13. He will lead you into all truth:
  <hi>The Argument is this. To hold that Christs promise is not true, is damnable
  blasphemy: But to hold that the universall Church hath er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in so necessary a
  matter as baptism, and that for so many hundred years, is to hold that Christs
  promise is not true, his promise of being with his Church, of guiding it by the
  spirit into all truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>To hold the Universall Church hath so erred is
  damnable blasphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Anabaptists object, That the Church of Rome useth
  this Argument for her traditions; The Answer is, That those traditions which
  she pleads for were neither universal nor doctrinal, as this of baptism, and
  therefore the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception against her was just, and those errors which she
  defends by that, were denyed to be of the universall Church: But the
  Anabaptists can never prove, that this practise hath not been universall, or
  dare not say, that this matter is not doctrinal.</hi>

               <head>Re-Review.</head>
               <p>This Argument is so far from having any substance, and weight in
  it toward the demonstration of the truth of infant-baptism, that it is not so
  much as a <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall</hi> syllo gism, but meerly <hi>Sophisticall,</hi> so
  that any that are never so little learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Logick</hi> may discern it to

  which is by us denyed, in which <hi>Illud infertur, ut contradictorium nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
  quod revera non contradicit:</hi> it doth not at all conclude the point in
  questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for that you are to prove is not that it is damnable blasphemy to
  hold that the universal Church hath erred in baptism, but that to deny
  infant-baptism is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable blasphemy, toward the direct and legitimate
  illustration of which bold charge, wherewith you assault us, <hi>viz.</hi> that
  our denyall of infant-baptism is damnable blasphemy, you ought of right to have
  made this <hi>pro-Syllogism, viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To hold the universall Church hath erred in so necessary a
  matter as baptism is damnable blasphemy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But to deny the lawfulness of infant-baptism is to hold that
  the universall Church hath erred in that matter of baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>To deny infant-baptism is damnable blasphemy.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> of which <hi>pro-syllogism</hi> we do not put
  you to the trouble of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, neither do we hold any such thing that the
  universall Church hath erred in baptism, any more then you, for the primitive
  Church did not erre in it, though you do; yet how do you belabour your selves
  here to prove what we deny not?</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Minor</hi> of that <hi>pro-syllogism,</hi> which we

                  </gap> it
  self most peccant, and apparently false, (for to hold infant-baptism to be an

  uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Church hath not held it) the prove of this you evade, and most
  <hi>serpentinely</hi> slide away from, never medling with it at all, unto a
  business you might as well have spared your pains in, and fall a
  <hi>Syllogizing</hi> upon us in the self same <hi>sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> way as
  <hi>Rome</hi> doth for her <hi>Popes</hi> Supremacy, and all other her

               <p>
                  <hi>To hold Christ promise is not true is damnable

               <p>
                  <hi>But to hold that the universall Church hath erred is to hold

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>es concluded what is not questioned, for the question is not
  whether the head of the Church have supremacy over all or no? for none denies
  but that it hath, but whether the <hi>Pope</hi> be at all that head? that is it
  which we deny, and they take perforce for granted from us before we have
  yielded it, or themselves proved it, and so proceed to have more mischief by
  it: so again in the first the question is not whether the universal Church hath
  erred or no? but whether <hi>Rome</hi> be that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Church or no that
  cannot erre? or whether those traditions she practises, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which infant
  baptism is said to be one by Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Mr.
  <hi>Rogers</hi> to be the most reverent) have bin universally practised or no?
  which we deny that they were, for the first Gospel Church knew none of them,
  and so they are not universall: which <hi>Romish</hi> Sillygisms the best
  <hi>Logicians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Protestants are so far from answering so
  formally, as you strive to do to the first of them in this place, that they
  rather explode them as <hi>Silly</hi> and <hi>Sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> and so must I
  do yours, which is not onely <hi>Istius-modi,</hi> but <hi>in terminis</hi> the
  very same with the first of theirs.</p>
               <p>Therefore good Sirs fall back a litttle, and begin again, and
  make a <hi>prosyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism</hi> or two if you please, before this
  <hi>Syllogism</hi> takes its turn, and do not beat the air, and let flie such
  hot bullets, as accusations of damnable blasphemy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have any
  adversary appearing against you: for verily you first falsely sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose us your
  opposites in that, wherein we agree with you, and bestir your selves to fight
  us in such a fierce fashion, as if you would fright us out of our cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
  you come neer us, and set your selves to prove that, which whoever doth yet, I
  for my part do not deny; for verily tis the <hi>minor,</hi> and not the
  <hi>major</hi> in the <hi>Prosyllogism,</hi> which we quarrel with, and as for
  this <hi>Syllogism</hi> of yours, I honour it not so farre as to own it:
  neverthelesse if it be lawful to make a formal answer to an unlawful argument,
  and least you take it ill, and think much on't if I sleight it so as to give no
  other reply then that above, Ile make bold to answer it now its brought by you
  for infant-baptism, as you do when the same is brought by <hi>Rome</hi> for
  other traditions <hi>viz.</hi> that this tradition you plead for is not
  univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally practised: therefore taking your words in a true sense, and in
  their largest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, though I dare not be so damable in my doctrine as you
  <hi>viz.</hi> to bring eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one under blame of damable blasphemy who holds a
  possibility of error to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the universal Church i. e. the whole state of
  Christs Church, which is but imperfect here on Earth, yet can I not say, nor do
  I that <hi>in esse actuali</hi> the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church hath erred in the
  practise of this point of baptism, so as that she hath been totally diserted by
  the spirit of God, and that Christ hath not made good his promise to her any
  more then your selves: yea really if you use the word <hi>[universal
  Church]</hi> in its due and proper extent <hi>viz.</hi> in respect of both time
  and place, and in the like latitude, in which Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> (from whom
  you borrowed this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and some of the

  us to him for it, as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled your selves to hold it out here in a new
  harnesse) uses the word <hi>[universal <pb n="240" facs="tcp:42067:127"/> Church]</hi> as
  expressing <hi>All the assemblies of Christians in the world, that ever were
  from the Apostles dayes to this present,</hi> which he stiles the <hi>formal
  Church,</hi> this universal Church cannot be impeached with error in the point
  of infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, for it hath not universally owned it, neither was it in use
  from the beginning, there have bin some ages and places wherein the Churches
  practised baptism so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to Christs will, that you shall never be shent
  by him as failing in that point if you do it no otherwise then it was done then
  and there <hi>viz.</hi> the dayes and places wherein the primitive Churches
  dispenst it, for they were all so wholly stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to your infant baptism,
  that not so much as the sound of such a thing was ever heard among them: and
  howbeit Dr. <hi>Featle,</hi> tells us a tale p. 16. out of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> on
  the <hi>Romans</hi> (whose originall is lost, and into which work of his on the
  <hi>Romans</hi> tis shrewdly suspected by the learned, that <hi>Russinus,</hi>
  and the <hi>Romans</hi> have Sophisticated such a sentence, that the Church had
  infant-baptism from the Apostles) and thence very goodly grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A positive argument of very great moment</hi> (saith he)
  <hi>that may convince the conscience of any ingenuous Christian,</hi> viz.
  <hi>that the Apostles in their dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to baptize infants, and the whole
  Catholique Christian Church in all places and ages, even from the Apostles
  dayes, hath admitted the children of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an parents to holy baptism,
  therefore tis no error.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I must tell you that <hi>Origens</hi> bare word, and single
  <hi>say so</hi> (if it were his own) is no warrant, whereupon all men may
  safely, muchlesse must necessarily believe it was so: but the word of the New
  Testament, of which the Apostles mostly were the Pen-men, is warrant enough to
  us to believe that it was not so, were the word onely silent about it, how much
  more whilest it hath so much against it, that we may say tis exclusive of it;
  Howbeit therefore you say that infant baptism hath been universall, it is
  sufficient proof of its non universallity in that you can never prove that it
  hath been universall, and we have proved that in the Apostles dayes it was not
  so, that in the first <hi>Century</hi> twas not so, nor in the second for ought
  any man living can possibly shew, how ere it began to creep in about the third,
  and howbeit it hath been never so universally and erroneously practised from
  the fourth or fifth Centuries till now, yet neither will it follow that the
  universall Church hath practised it, nor that the universal Church hath erred
  in it, nor that Christs promise <hi>Mat. 28. 20. Ioh.</hi> 16. 13 14. 16. 17.
  29. concerning the spirits abode and guidance is not true, for thats not more
  made, then made good to those that perform the condition and terms, on which it
  was made <hi>viz.</hi> the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of what he commanded, in which case the
  spirit is ever present, and ever was and shall be with those few that keep the
  truth; as for the most, when they began to dote on mens teachings and
  traditions, and to fashion themselves more at a venture after the words of the
  wise and prudent, then after the word of God it self, and to Idolize the
  dictates of <hi>Synods,</hi> and <hi>Ghostly fathers,</hi> so as blindly to
  subject themselves to their sentences, as their onely <hi>Oracles,</hi> then
  <hi>Terras Astr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  Christ who did ingage to lead them by his spirit, who would be led by it, was
  dis-ingaged, and true enough in his promises, though he left the world to lie
  in darknesse, and to be filled with their own wayes, and with the fruits of

  though there have been an number of Saints in sackcloth, that have seen much
  light from Christ, and suffered for it, yet I am so far from undertaking to
  prove there was, that I am rather of the mind there was not, nor was to be (if
  the word be true) any <hi>truly collected, truly constituted</hi> visible
  Churches at all in right outward form, and order, standing upon that true
  foundation, i.e. the principles of the Doctrine of Christ, and the primitive

  shall also finish it, not by Army, nor by strength, but by my spirit saith the
  Lord of Hosts.</p>
               <p>If this answer be not satisfactory that our Churches are true
  ones, unless I can prove a lineal succession of them from the Apostles times to
  these, let me see what lineal succession is of your Churches from the Apostles
  daies, if I ask you <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick Priests</hi> (as the <hi>Masse Priests</hi>
  do) where was your Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> and you
  <hi>Presbyterians</hi> where was your Church before <hi>Calvin?</hi> in both
  whose daies you cannot deny, but that of those that denyed infant-baptism there
  were abundance; must you not needs see both your Churches swallowed up in the
  Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for ages and generations together, making one with
  that? were not the two little heads of the <hi>Roman Eagle</hi> spoken of 2
  <hi>Esdras</hi> 11. 12. which are the two smaller kingdomes of the Clergy, i.

  one, i. e. the <hi>Popedome,</hi> till of late they separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him.</p>
               <p>First sure I am you may labour till you are weary, and look till
  your eyes fail <pb n="242" facs="tcp:42067:128"/> before you find a series of visible
  protestant Churches before <hi>Luther,</hi> and as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal as you Protestant
  priesthood do proclaim your selves, and your Church to have been, yet I tell
  you twill puzzle you to derive your pedigree from the <hi>Apostles,</hi> if the
  Pope put you to prove it by induction, and ennumeration of Churches,
  suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding without interruption, unless you will own him to be your father, as
  to your <hi>Clericall</hi> function you are fain to do.</p>
               <p>Whereupon in the book stiled <hi>Luthers predecessors, or an
  answer to the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Papists; viz. Where was your Church before
  Luther?</hi> p. 3. 4. I find it ingenuously acknowledged by the nameless Author
  thereof, in his undertaking to answer that question, That if the Papistry the
  Protestant to assign any visible constituted Church, which might have been
  known by the distinction, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of <hi>Bishops, Elders, Deacons,</hi>
  &amp;c. the task is unequal, and that records of such a thing are wanting,
  insomuch that he puts it off in replying to the Papists, thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they cannot prove that the Church must alwaies be in
  such manner vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: that in</hi> Elias <hi>time there were 7000 unknown to
  him, much more to</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab: <hi>that in Christs passion some papists say the
  Church was in</hi> Mary, <hi>the Church being like the Moon, allwaies lasting,

               </p>
               <p>And then in resolution to the quaere it self alledges not any
  one protestant Church at all, but onely here and there a Protestant professor,
  as <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and such mostly as were after him inlightned by his

               <p>I find it also thereupon the

                  </gap>le, that in a conference which
  was once held upon the same question by Dr. <hi>White,</hi> and Dr.
  <hi>Featley</hi> against two others, viz. <hi>Fisher,</hi> and <hi>Sweet,</hi>
  Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> chose rather to prove a continual succession of
  protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants by the truth of their doctrine, then the truth of the Protestant
  Churches and doctrine by a perpetuity of succession; and so doth that Author
  himself who ever it was, that wrote the answer to that papistical question, as
  well aware that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Churches cannot prove themselves true by succession
  p. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What</hi> saith he <hi>if we could not prove that the
  English Church was before</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Must it needs follow that the
  doctrine we hold is untrue? or shall the doctrine of</hi> Rome <hi>be ever the
  truer because of Antiquitie only? No certainly, And why not? because the Church
  must be proved and allowed by the doctrine, and not the Doctrine authorized by
  the Church, which the Papists (a people wise in their generation) well knowing
  have overturned the course of Nature, and will have the Scripture, and all
  doctrine to hang upon the determination of the Church, hoping that if once they
  have amazed any one with the name of the Church, and driven him from title and
  interest in the Church before</hi> Luthers <hi>time, they shall easily call in
  question the whole frame of the doctrine of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we see the Protestants are faln to fence off the papists
  arguments from universality, Antiquity, perpetuity, in which <hi>Rome</hi>
  outstrips the reformed Churches, with pleading only the verity of their
  doctrine, and its being persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in some few professors of it before
  <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea verily if universality, perpetuity, or antiquity either (I
  mean that post primitive Antiquity of the fourth or fifth Century) may pass for
  president more current then the primitive, the Pope and his priesthood may
  prove the protestant priesthood to be but <hi>upstart Novices</hi> to them by
  this way of arguing from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, perpetual, universal practise of their
  Church.</p>
               <p>I write not this as taking the Papists part against the
  Protestants, for so far am I from justifying the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> that I
  rather fight with Dr. <hi>Featley,</hi> and his

                  </gap>s Churches then to the
  <hi>Iesuits,</hi> when vaunting in their own visible universallity they ask,
  them where was your Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> for verily if it must be
  taken from you by the Papists, as evidence good enough that your Churches are
  the true Churches, and lineally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from Christ, though none of them
  ever visibly appeared before <hi>Luther,</hi> in all that time of the Popes
  <hi>Peterdome</hi> ore his fellows, because your doctrine is truer then that of
  theirs, and specially since several witnesses successively held it out against
  <hi>Romes</hi> contradictions, then I hope it shall be taken from us by you
  Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants as good evidence that our Churches are yet truer then yours, and
  such as have been as much as yours have been in visible constitution from the
  time of the treading down till this modern resurrection, because our doctrine
  and practise is that of the primitive and purest times, specially since we can
  evince it as clearly, that many witnessed the truth of it against
  infant-baptism, in times of priestly tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as you can that any have
  witnessed yours at all.</p>
               <p>For howbeit you say your infants baptism was not so much as
  questioned, till of late, if you had your wits so well about you as you should,
  you could not but see that twas almost ever opposed: for though it were never
  heard of in the first Century, yet that it hath been ever withstood since it
  came up, is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the conflicts of corrupt times for it, for what
  made such controversies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fathers about it? what m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>de <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his 66 Bishops
  conven'd in councel, lay their heads together to find out such superstitious
  stuff (as your selves are ashamed of) wherewith to support it? what made
  <hi>Bernard</hi> complain that twas laught at among other ridiculosities as
  praying to, and for the dead? what made <hi>Imperiall</hi> lawes, and
  <hi>Synodical</hi> cannons enjoin it under such strict penalties? what made
  Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. who together with the 600 Bishops, and all the rest
  of the Clergy, which in the councel of <hi>Lateran</hi> determined
  Transubstantiation, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, were called fooles and block-heads, seducers
  of the people, hereticks and blaspemers by <hi>Iohn Purvey</hi> one of
  <hi>Wickliffs</hi> followers p. 17 of <hi>Luth.</hi> praedec. what (I say) made
  that <hi>Innocent</hi> among other things decree so strictly, as he did, that
  the baptism of believers infants should succeed circumcision, if that tradition
  found no Traitors which sought the death out, and if the risets up against it
  were hardly heard of before <hi>Luther</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Either then the verity of doctrine in Churches, reformed from
  <hi>Romes</hi> downright dotage, doth prove as Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> sayes well
  it doth, a perpetual duration of it, so that it must needs have professors in
  all ages, or it proves it not: if not, then the main argument whereby Dr.
  <hi>Featley</hi> defends Protestanism, to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually before
  <hi>Luther,</hi> doth not vindicate you in your Religion from the name of
  <hi>Novellists</hi> any more then us, and so the Pope by his plea for the
  verity of his Church from perpetuall visibility, universality &amp;c. carries
  the cause clean from us all; but if it doth, then as we deny your
  infant-baptism to have been perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, because its false doctrine, and our
  Church and way of baptism we hold in contradistinction to you, being as
  consonant to the word and primitive pattern as the truest of those doctrines
  you hold in contradistinction to the Pope, is vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by <hi>Featleys</hi>
  own argument, to have been as perpetually before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> as the
  purest piece of Protestanism, and party of Protestants what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
               <p>Again, an ennumeration of a successive number of particular
  persons barely professing the truth in the times of all Christendoms erring
  from it, but not visibly <pb n="244" facs="tcp:42067:129"/> constituted into any right
  Church form or order, either doth prove Christ and his spirit to have been with
  his people alwayes, and in all ages according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and consequently
  his promise in that particular to be true, notwithstanding the worlds so
  universal erring for a time, or else it doth not prove it: if such an
  ennumerarion of single professors successively witnessing to the truth against
  <hi>Romish</hi> error doth not clear Christs promise to be true, then your
  selves are as justly charged by the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> who use the same
  argument against you, that you use against us, to be guilty of that damnable
  blasphemy of denying Christs promise to be true, as we are charged to be guilty
  of it by your selves, for as much as all that you say towards the salving of
  Christs promise of his perpetual presence with your Church, while he left
  <hi>Rome,</hi> from fault of falshood, is but an induction of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain persons,
  that before <hi>Luther</hi> testified to your doctrine; yea he that answers the
  <hi>Iesuites</hi> question sayes no more, confessing that a succession of
  Protestant Churches cannot be shewed; but if it doth prove Christ his promise
  to be true, then I hope it serves to prove it in our case as well as yours, or
  else its a hard case indeed, for as much as though a perpetual succession of
  such visible Churches as ours are, is not to be shewed through all ages of the
  <hi>Clergies</hi> crushing down the truth, yet we can give as full evidence of

  a foundation among the rest of those principles <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. of
  Christs doctrine, which altogether are called the foundation i. e. to the

  Temple which was trodden under foot by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, advancing all into the
  name of the Church at the door of infant-sprinkling, must preach and practise
  again that true baptism of repentance for remission of sins, in the absence of
  which there was no true visible Church as to outward order and form at all, in
  their opinion as well as mine, who hold (and so does the whole <hi>Clergy)</hi>
  that baptism is the way, by which persons enter, and out of which there is no
  entring at all into the visible Church, in which therefore to erre is in truth
  such <hi>an unsufferable crime,</hi> and so fearfully to erre in one of the
  most <hi>necessary points</hi> of Religion (as pertaining to visible Church

  and be baptized truly according to Christs will in the name of the Lord Iesus
  for remission of that, and all other your sins and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions, your error

  at all, nor conclude thereby that the whole <hi>Church</hi> of God hath

  satisfaction, sith I have been very often charged, and that twice or thrice in
  publique places where I have preacht, so to hold, I shall here give this brief
  account.</p>
               <p>I judge that all persons in the world (meaning not infants, but
  such as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <item>1. Either such as neither believe at all, nor so much as in
 words profess so to do, Or</item>
                  <item>2. Such as in words say they believe, and indeed do not.
 Or</item>
                  <item>3. Such as both profess to believe, and do indeed believe
 as they say.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Now I suppose we all hold the first sort, <hi>viz.</hi>

  will deny the Scriptures, we must needs hold the second sort, whose professed

  them in my thoughts into 2 ranks.</p>
               <p>First, such as believing in Christ truly for salvation, believe
  also baptism in its true way of dispensation, and not rantism, to be Christs
  will concerning them, and these I am certain will submit accordingly and obey
  him in it, for such as say they have faith, and live in rebellion to what parts
  of Christs will they know they ought to obey him in, have not faith to
  salvation what ever they say. Or</p>
               <p>Secondly, such as believing in Christ, neither see nor believe,
  nor practise baptism in that only true way wherin we dispense it, and all this
  meerly for want of meanes to discover it to them, or by means of the invincible
  ignorance of their times, and ages wherein they lived, and wherein, according
  to the will of God permitting it so to be, the mind of God in that thing hath
  been hid, and, as we know it hath in many more things for ages and generations
  together, remained undiscovered, which times of ignorance I believe God much
  winked at, in those who sincerely owned truth, and obeyed it so far as it then
  appeared, and as they saw it, tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  must be baptized under the Gospel, because circumcisied under the law, we might
  more pertinently set up a shout at your shameful folly in this particular, then
  set upon the shewing of it any more, it is so palpable; for verily (as is
  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved sufficiently above) these two <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of the law and
  the Gospel, from the <hi>Identity</hi> of which you infer an <hi>Identity</hi>
  in the subject of the ordinances and administrations of both, and by way of
  <hi>analogy,</hi> would evince them both to belong to the same persons, I must
  tell you these are two Testaments, or wills of God, concerning men, in those
  two different times <hi>viz.</hi> before Christ and since, and these two so
  specifically distinct, that they not onely run upon different strains and
  require different terms (as your selves here confesse) the law saying do this
  and live, the Gospell onely believe, but also stand upon different promises,
  whereof the Gospels being of the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> are better then the
  laws, which were but of an earthly one, and these also pertaining to two
  different seeds <hi>viz.</hi> the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal to the natural children of
  <hi>Abraham</hi> i. e. <hi>Isaac</hi> and his posterity by generation; the
  Evangelical to the spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> i. e. such as are of
  Christ by faith and regeneration; and they had also different dispensations,
  the one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, the other another thing <hi>viz.</hi> dipping, a thing
  no way like it, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent subjects also for those different dispensations,
  so that (if men and their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters were not all turned <hi>Momes)</hi> they
  could not, but must manifestly perceive it, the old Testament admitting to
  circumcision onely males, and these onely on the eighth day, in case they were
  in the house so young, and all the males in the house, whether sons or
  servants, whether born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, and
  all this without respect to either faith or repentance in the persons to whom
  dispenst, or any prae-preaching to them by the person dispensing, the new
  Testament taking in to baptism as no servants upon the masters faith, so all
  persons in the world both males and females upon their own, and that upon any
  day, and not the eighth onely, wherein after they have been preacht to, they
  professe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe <hi>Mat. 3. Act, 2. Act. 8. Act.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>The proof of which real, specifical diversity of these two
  Covenants is yet farre more evident.</p>
               <p>First, because the spirit denominates them so to be in
  Scripture, calling them expressely the two Covenants <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 24. and
  also very osten <hi>(in plurali)</hi> the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, the covenants of
  promise.</p>
               <p>Secondly by that contradistinction of speech, which the spirit
  useth, when he speaks of them, and those oppposite Epithets, by which he
  diversifies them, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one the <hi>Law,</hi> the other the <hi>Gospel,</hi>

  <hi>shadow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you find the Scripture opposing one of these two to the

               <p>That the Covenant of grace is for substance not two but in all
  ages one and the same within it self who denies? but what then? is it therefore
  one and the same with another, that most manifestly, and downrightly differs
  from it, and is as distinct a convenant also as that within it self? for so
  verily the law, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so called the first covenant, or the Covenant of
  Circumcision, was varying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully from that Gospel Covenant, whereof yet
  we confesse it to be the type, in both its Priesthood and People, its Mediator
  and Attonement, sacrifices and offerings, precepts and promises, inheritance
  and heirs, birth-priviledges and seed, ordinances and their subjects, and all
  things thereunto pertaining: I say they were very divers each from other,
  saving still that one was to shadow out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>viz. Moses the</hi>
  Mediator, <hi>Ioshua</hi> the Saviour, <hi>Aaron</hi> the High-Priest, and his
  burnt offerings, for that temporal annuall Attonement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2.
  and purgation from fleshly impurities, were all to point out Christ, who is all
  this spiritually, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mediator, Saviour, High-Priest, Sacrifice,
  and author of eternal Attonement between God and us, and purification of our
  Consciences in the Gospel; those earthly promises and inheritance were to
  represent our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, their fleshly heirship, birth-priviledges, seed, and
  admission of new born babes to ordinances, to shadow out what high born heirs
  those babes are, who are begotten to the faith, and their right and title to a
  standing in the Gospel Church.</p>
               <p>O but saies Mr. <hi>Marshall,</hi> they had the same Gospel
  Covenant that we have, <pb n="254" facs="tcp:42067:134"/> the same Christ, the same
  conditions, i. e. faith and repentance &amp;c.</p>
               <p>First, take notice that with him faith and repentance are the
  conditions on which persons stood then, and ever before, and do now in the
  Gospell Covenant which things he knowes infants have not, and therefore are not
  by right to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly inchurched, and incovenanted under the Gospel. till
  they visibly appear to have them, yet under the Law they were in covenant, and
  inchurched for all that and why? because faith and repentance were not the
  conditions of that Church-covenant andordinances, nor of heirship to that
  Earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but meer flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly descent of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi>
  and <hi>Iacob,</hi> which whoever had, had title to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and
  <hi>Canaan</hi> (though not to heaven) thereupon, if they never believed, nor
  repented whilest they breathed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, but what if they had the same Gospel Covenant, that we
  have, held forth to them, at least in a darker way, will it follow therefore
  that they had not also another Covenant over and above that peculiar to
  themselves, which we have not, whereof circumcision was a token, and which
  believing Gentiles, much less their seed have nought to do with at all? I trow
  not, for though we grant Mr. <hi>Marshall,</hi> that they had the substance of
  the Gospel among them, as also <hi>Adam, Noah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> had,
  and the same priviledges of that Covenant that we have (excepting some
  circumstances of it, wherein we are beyond them) that will not run
  <hi>retro</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> would fain have it)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the self same priviledges formerly made peculiar to the
  Iews, are now through Christ conveyed to the Gentiles:</hi> for the old
  Covenant pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges <hi>viz.</hi> the fleshly birth holiness, and heirship to
  <hi>Canaan,</hi> and title to be sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as heirs, upon a meer natural descent
  are such as the best Gentiles, and best believers seed in the world can lay no
  claim to, for that was (as we see Gen. 17.) a distinct proper Covenant to
  themselves, as the fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham, Isaac and Iacob,</hi> whom the
  spiritual seed themselves have (as such) no right 'to partake with in their
  inheritance or earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> as this fleshly seed (as meerly such)
  have no right to partake with the other in their heavenly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi>

  all outward punishments and threatnings, losse of their Countrey, going into
  captivity, and their sacrifices, their washings, their sprinklings, their holy
  persons, holy feasts, and holy things, were all of them but so many
  administrations of the Covenant of grace; earthly things were not onely
  promised and threatned more distinctly and fully, then now they are to them who
  are in Covenant, but were figures, signs and types, and sacraments of spiritual
  things, to be enjoyed both by them and us.</hi>

               <p>As I grant the Covenant of Grace, which promises eternal life on
  conditions (as Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> confesses) of only faith and repentance,
  to be for substance for ever the same within it self, so I grant that the other
  covenant <hi>viz.</hi> all those external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of outward blessings, which
  were to be enjoyed by the Iews in <hi>Canaan,</hi> in case of their obedience,
  was a certain outward administration, and lively type of that inward and true
  covenant of grace, yet still must it be regranted by Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> and
  all men, that even that was a true, real, and really distinct cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant also of
  it self, and though that were a plain picture, and a map of the other, and as
  it were a different dresse wherewith it was clothed upon, and wherein it was
  exhibited to the world, yet was it not onely an administration of the Gospel,
  but also an entire covenant, so substantially divided from that, as that its
  most properly denominated another covenant, and not that, and they both are
  truly denominated to be two viz. an old and new one, a first, and a second,
  which they <pb n="255" facs="tcp:42067:134"/> could not genuinely be, unless one were more
  then meerly another form and manner of administration of the other.</p>
               <p>Nay seriously if that Gospel covenant, which both you and wee
  say is one and the same in substance, onely admitted variation in its
  circumstances, doth mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply it self answerably to the number of those
  different clothings, which that one body hath successively come forth in, and
  must be as multifariously expressed, as it hath shewed it self in various
  habits to our view, and bear the names of two, of first and second, old and new

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ons: then sith there hath been not two onely, but as
  you say truely your selves, four remarable periods, and circumstantial
  appearances of that covenant <hi>viz.</hi> the first from <hi>Adam</hi> to
  <hi>Abraham;</hi> the second from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moses;</hi> the third
  from <hi>Moses</hi> to <hi>Christ;</hi> the fourth from <hi>Christ</hi> to the
  end; the word would sure have spoken of four covenants, or testaments, and not
  two onely <hi>viz.</hi> two old ones, and two new ones, or the first and
  second, the third and fourth, and so by that reckoning this is the fourth
  testament that we are under, yet truly it is but a second, and a second truly
  it is, in respect to that first testament thats now vanisht, that once was in
  force, and had truly, though more carnally and also typically of this, and as
  this also more spiritually hath, ordinances of divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and a
  sanctuary, and a mediator, and Saviour, and salvation; and Priest-hood, and
  sacrifices, and blood of sprinkling, and purifying, an atonement, and an
  inheritance, and a promised land and a seed entitled to it, and a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
  evidencing it, and given as a token <hi>viz.</hi> that to the fleshly seed
  which was circumcision of the flesh, this tothe spiritual babes, I mean
  believers i. e. the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the heart.</p>
               <p>And howbeit that was a kind of administration of this, that the
  map, this the main thing meant by it, that the picture, this the person
  represented, that the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing this the body, at that time set forth
  gloriously thereby, yet all this denies not but that that map, that picture,
  that clothing, that glorious administration was also (as it is also called a
  distinct Covenant within it self, which though it stood truly for a time, yet
  because also as a type of what should be under Christ, is now utterly
  abrogated, u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>terly nullified
  together with the holinesse of all its most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous holy ordinances, whereof
  circumcision was a chief one, and in infancy to be dispensed, and with the
  holinesse of all their holy things, and their holy persons also i. e. the whole
  race of the Iews to all their posterities, which holy persons Mr.
  <hi>Marshal</hi> (wellfare his heart for it) in that clause I now answer to,
  confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be a type, must consequently confesse their holinesse to be
  totally taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way now the truth is come in, and not translated from that holy
  people to belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gentiles and their seed: for these can have none of the
  holinesse of that old Covenant now, which yet you will needs have to be no more
  but a bare administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new.</p>
               <p>And lastly take it to be but so, you will gain by it no smal
  disadvantage to your cause: for though you yield it not to be point blank
  another Covenant, yet if you yield it to be another administration of the
  Gospel Covenant, divers from this we are now under, you grant us enough as to
  our present purpose, yea as much as we need to desire, for our dispute is not
  now to the Covenant it self so much, as to its manner of administration; so
  that let that covenant and this be as much one as they will, yet if the manner
  of administrations of the Gospel Covenant in its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinances, were then
  (as you say) unlike to what they are now, you give us no lesse by your own
  argument then even all that we contend for, for the very thing you plead from
  the consideration of that <hi>Identity,</hi> which is dreamed by you to be in
  the Covenant, is an <hi>Identity</hi> in the manner of administration of
  ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under both the law and the Gospel: for whoever shall say that the
  manner of administration of baptism under the Gospel must be as the manner of
  administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of circumcision was under the law, and in proof thereof shall
  say the Covenant <pb n="256" facs="tcp:42067:135"/> of the Law and Gospel is one and the
  same, though the manner of administration be different, <hi>suo se ingulabit
  gladio,</hi> will even quite cut the throat of his own cause, yet thus plainly
  doth Mr. <hi>Marshall</hi> speak p. 12. of his Ser. viz. <hi>Now this external
  administration of the covenant is not the same with us, as it was with them but
  the Covenant is the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is it so <hi>Sirs?</hi> so you say it seems as well as we;
  then you have brought your hoggs to a fair Market indeed, for if the externall
  administration, which was then be, as to the manner of it, different from that
  which is now, then I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what pattern you can pick from that manner of
  administration, whereby to steer your cause now, and to direct your selves
  about the true manner of this: for will any wise man in any w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rk, action or administration he is
  about to perform take his example by another work, action or administration
  which himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses is quite different from it, and not after the same
  manner as that is to be done in, which he hath now in hand to do? yet thus do
  you whilest contending that the outward administration of the covenant among
  the Jews was not in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the outward administration of it is to
  be now, you yet contend to have our baptism as much as may be after the manner
  of their circumcision: you must, and you must not it seems (and these both at
  once) walk after those customes, and do things now after the manner of
  <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any man then ask me this question, viz. sith the Gospel
  covenant is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly the same for substance, and little children under
  the law received circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion the seal as you call it, of the Gospel covenant,
  why then should not little children under the Gospel receive baptism, the seal
  (so I hear you say) of the Gospel covenant? and why should not this
  administration of the covenant in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinances be after the manner of
  that of old?</p>
               <p>I answer him out of Mr. <hi>Marshalls</hi> own mouth thus,
  <hi>because</hi> though for substance the Gospel Covenant be ever one and the
  same, yet the manner of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal administration thereof, is not the same with
  us as twas with them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to take example in our
  Dispensations, and administrations by them, nor regard to do after the manner
  of them, the Priest-hood being chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of necessity there is a change also of
  the Law, for the administrators are not the same with us, as with them, nor the
  administrations the same in matter, not the manner of administration to them
  the same, nor the subjects to whom these administrations belong the same, for
  those were to all the holy Jewes, though never so unholy and unbelieving, but
  these to Jewes and Gentiles as they believe and no otherwise: least of all is
  the subject of circumcision and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism the same, for that above all the rest
  was limitted to all males, and those on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at eight daies old, this extending
  to males and females, and those only when they professe to be believers.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Circumcision was a more Evangelical administration then the
  rest, as being given when the Gospel was preached to</hi> Abraham 430 <hi>years
  before the Law, therefore we may give the more heed to that, sith it is of the

               <p>Though it were in being so long before <hi>Moses,</hi> yet was
  it as directly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his law as any other administration what-ever, for
  howbeit it was before him, yet it is said to be of him, as all the Sacrifices
  also were, which were of old before circumcision, because he gave them all

  service, which ended in <hi>Christ,</hi> and was even from the very
  beginning.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Though the Gospel Covenant was preached in a type to
  <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. where circumcision was also first
  appointed, yet that in reference to which Circumcision of the flesh was there
  instituted, was immediately that first and old <pb n="261" facs="tcp:42067:135"/> covenant
  of the Law, which was in some parcels and pieces of it before
  <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and now was propounded a little more fully in the promise of
  that land to his fleshly seed, and the express appointment of that one more
  special precept thereof, i. e. Circumcision, though the fulnesse of it came not
  till four hundred and thirty years after: yea he that hath but half an eye in

  are his seed, to whom in and with him the promise is made, for as the believer
  himself as a believer i. e. as <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed had no share 
  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:42067:136"/> in the old covenant promise i. e. <hi>Canaan,</hi> if

  <hi>Abraham</hi> and that fleshly seed onely (in a type of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, and
  yet truly too) those promises were made, so a believers fleshly seed, as barely
  a believers seed, though born of believing <hi>Abrahams</hi> own body, as the
  Iews are at this day (and thats a higher birth one should think to entitle to
  the Gospel, if any fleshly birth could do it, then to be born of our Protestant
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers) have no share in this new Covenant promise, if not born (as I may
  say) of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Isaac</hi> i. e. <hi>Christ</hi> after the
  faith. or by faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> and so personally, even every individual
  for himself, not <hi>Catervatim,</hi> or <hi>domestica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> whole

  upon the root, and spirituallized into that stock or family of <hi>Abraham</hi>
  i. e. the visible Church in which his own natural branches, much more any other
  mans meer naturall branches, can have no place now, any further then as they
  ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to believe.</p>
               <p>Indeed the natural branches stood of right upon meer fleshly
  birth of believing <hi>Abraham</hi> without faith, so long as that fleshly
  birth-priviledge lasted, and could give a standing, and till the time of faith,
  and standing there by personal faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came, and then they were broken off
  indeed because of unbelief, yet not nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally as you say, i. e. the whole
  body for the unbelief of some <hi>viz.</hi> the persons of the children through
  allages, for the infidelity of the parents, for its evident that as many as
  believed, and those were not a few, when the rest were rejected, were then and
  thereupon admitted <hi>Act.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>And as many children of them in any age as believe, the unbelief
  of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents shall not prejudice them, but personally every individual
  that did not believe, which the more is the pitty, were for the most part both
  children and parents too in the primitive times, save some few persons that did
  then believe, whose children yet for all that promise to them and their
  children you so talk of out of <hi>Act.</hi> the 2. 39. came all to nought
  through unbelief, for else indeed the promise, even after Christ crucified was
  to them, as also to all others so sure in case of faith, that that causelesse
  curse of their parents, wishing the blood of Christ to be on them and their

               <p>
                  <hi>So then when Christ the true promised seed was come the seed
  in the flesh, that lead to Christ ceased, for the natural relation ceased at
  the death of Christ, and not before, at which time the distinction or different
  holinesse between Iew and Gentile ceased, Act. 10. 28. Eph.</hi> 2. 13. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> Rom. 11. 20. <hi>it is said through unbelief they
  are broken off, now tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest they were the true Church till the death of
  Christ, and then broken off through unbelief: why were not the Iews in the sin
  of unbelief before? yes no doubt, why then were they not broken off before? and
  why then? the reason is because the time of faith was come, and therefore now
  they were broken off through unbelief; the seed was come therefore the natural
  seed ceased, Christ was come therefore the law ceased. As long as the law
  lasted they did remain in the Church by being circumcised; and observing the
  rites and ceremonies of <pb n="264" facs="tcp:42067:137"/> the Law, though they did remain
  in unbelief, but when the time of faith was come</hi> Gal. 3. 25. <hi>then they
  were no longer in the Covenant, and Church by observing the rites and
  Ceremonies of the Law, which they entered into by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, but now they
  were broken off through unbelief: which notes out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us that the standing in
  that Church before Christ in time of the Law, and the standing in this Church
  since Christ in time of the Gospel is upon different grounds, for the standing
  in that Church was by being circumcised, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the rites and
  ceremonies of the Law; but the standing in this Church is by faith, and being
  baptized into the same faith</hi> Act. 2. 38. 41. Joh. 4. 1. Gal. 3. 26, 27.
  Rom, 11. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it is to be noted that the Iewes, the same people that
  were circumcised, and in covenant with Abraham according to the flesh, and
  thereby members of the Iewish Church could not be the visible church according
  to the Gospell, unless they did manifest faith, and so be in covenant with</hi>
  Abraham <hi>according to the spirit, and baptized into the same faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whereas if the Covenant now under Christ were the same that
  was before Christ with Abraham and his posterity in the flesh, then by the same
  right they possessed circumcision and the Iewish Church state, they must
  possesse this since Christ, which they could not do, therefore it is not the
  same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is true therefore that the Covenant of God makes the
  Church both in time of the Law, and Gospel too, for the Church is nothing else
  but a people in covenant with God, now look how the covenant differs so the
  Church and people differs which is made by it, and which enter into
  it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the Covenant, whereby God took a people outwardly to be
  his people then, was that, whereby they did, being circumcised, participate of
  all those outward meanes which led to Christ, which was to come,</hi> Psal.
  149. 19. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Covenant, whereby he takes a people outwardly to be
  his people now, whereby they are admitted to be baptized, is that profession
  they make of faith in Christ</hi> Acts 8. 12. 37. Mat 3. 6. <hi>Whereby they
  have true and spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with God and are his people</hi> Heb. 3.
  6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Indeed it is true that Christ is and ever was the Mediator
  and Means of salvation, and also that all those that were saved, were saved
  through faith in him both before and since his comming: But yet because the
  outward means of making Christ known doth differently depend upon his being yet
  to come, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> upon his being come in
  the flesh; the one being more dark, the other more plain, the one more carnall,
  the other more spirituall, therefore the participation of these meanes doth
  make the state of the participants to differ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far are his words: and then noting certain differences to

               <p>He very truly concludes that such onely as are in the New

               <p>In the time therefore before Christ (saith he) such as would
  circumcise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their males, and observe the Law in the rites, and
  ceremonies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, together with their children by generation were the seed
  and in covenant with that Church, but now since Christ, only such as believe in
  Christ, and are thereby <pb n="265" facs="tcp:42067:137"/> children by regeneration, are
  the seed and in c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nant with this
  Church, and this he proves further yet.</p>
               <p>First, Because <hi>None of the Natural seed of</hi> Abraham
  <hi>are in the Covenant by vertue of any natural relation, though they did
  remain in the Iewish Church till the death of Christ, and as that Church then
  ceased so their being in the Church by an natural relation ceased also</hi>
  Act. 10. 28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8. Gal. 5. 28. 31—3. 7, 8, 9. 14. 16. 19.
  26. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, The Gentiles have no natural relation to
  become</hi> Abrahams <hi>seed by, therefore a believers child cannot become the
  seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>by being the seed of a believer, unless such children
  do believe themselves, and cannot otherwise in no respect be participants in
  the covenant made with</hi> Abraham <hi>p.</hi> 14, 15.</p>
               <p>And again p. 18. <hi>No Gentile</hi> (saith he) <hi>is Abrahams
  seed at all but by believing the righteousnesse of faith, allthough he be the
  child of believing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore because you tell us not only,</p>
               <p>First that believers children in infancy are <hi>Abrahams</hi>
  children, though they yet do not the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> i. e. believe
  not on him that justifyes them, as some of you do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e they do, but also,</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the promise of the Gospel is to believers and
  their seed.</p>
               <p>These both are abundantly confuted by that quotation of mine,
  which quotes more Scripture then you will ever answer, so that I wonder you
  blush not to shoot out so boldly two such blind, and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ound assertions together, the second of which I shall
  say no more to, it being virtually answered by what is more formally spoken to
  the first &amp; also because I have shewed so undeniably above, that I know
  your consciences must yield to it, and that from this <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39.
  whence you would wrest a proof to the contrary, that the promise, if you take
  it for the profer of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Grace, is to all men in the world, every
  creature, and so not to believers and their seed only, but to all unbelievers
  and their seed also, in case they shall believe, for he conditionats the
  promise on calling, for such these were, whom <hi>Peter</hi> spake to, whilst
  he was yet speaking that very word to them, <hi>viz.</hi> the promise is to you
  and your children; but if you take it for the thing promised, which is not
  Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership and participation of baptism, as some say whose absurdity
  therein I have declared, but the spirit, remission of sins, and salvation, this
  is made, good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the believer himself; and it is mercie enough to him
  that it is so I think, but not at all to his seed for his sake, nor his faiths
  sake, for if it be I testify his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren need no faith of their own: nay more
  God never made promise to save any of believing <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural seed,
  without faith in themselves for <hi>Abrahams</hi> sake, as neerly as he took
  <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his friend; for even he had sin enough of his own to
  have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> sake, for that merited not
  salvation for them, nor was it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental, but faith only in themselves, to
  any one of his sonnes salvation, for every one must bear his own burden, if
  Christ bear it not, and the just must live by his faith, and not his fathers,
  neither did he ever promise for his faiths sake to give faith to his natural
  seed as his, for then they must all have had it <hi>(qua sic</hi> including
  <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  blame them (as he doth) for unbelief, but himself, without whom (say you they
  could not believe &amp; who had promised to make them believe and did not,
  though yet he promised to circumcise i. e. by his spirit to sanctify the hearts
  of his spiritual seed, as well as his own i. e. all such as believe, and are in
  the faith with him, for the promise being still sure to all the seed, which it
  is made to they all must be blessed with faithful <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if God, who made the old Covenant promise of the earthly
  <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his fleshly seed, did not make the
  Gospel promise to him and <pb n="266" facs="tcp:42067:138"/> his fleshly seed, but onely

                  </gap> of his that believes with
  him, can we think that he made that promise to the Gentile believer, and his
  fleshly seed, for his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sake, unlesse he have faith of his own?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>No we do not say without respect to his own faith, but as

  they shall believe, as well as to either of the other, and by that account you
  may baptize all the world.</p>
               <p>Again, none of the Jews, though the natural seed of
  <hi>Abraham,</hi> and partakers of all the ordinances of the old testament (as
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> children) could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittted to be baptized upon that same
  natural relation, though they pleaded it never so stisfly <hi>Mat.</hi> 3 but
  only on manifestation of amendment, besides that 3000 converts should not
  baptize their children, when they were baptized themselves, as <hi>Abraham</hi>
  by command took all his males, and cirmumcised them the self same day with
  himself, argues plainly that both the covenant and the promise (as Mr.
  <hi>Marshal</hi> saies truly) as to the manner of administration was now
  changed, and not continued to parents and children both alike, but as they both
  alike believed.</p>
               <p>And that these were not baptized with their parents, I take Mr.
  <hi>Cotton</hi> at his word, who (as I have shewed before) confesses it, and if
  he should not stand to his testimonie herein, yet these words <hi>viz. as many
  as glady received the word were baptized,</hi> which exclude infants, and were
  an imperfect relation, if he meant not onely them that received the word, are
  so cogent that they cannot but compell him.</p>
               <p>So I have escaped two of your bullets, and as for the third
  <hi>viz.</hi> that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is a better Covenant, would be far worse,
  if believers children be not counted in it, and have not right to baptism, and
  membership as well as the Iews children, and be valued but as Turks and Pagans,
  this is so sick of the same dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of absurdity with the rest, that I fear
  not its doing much execution: besides, we have lamed it before, having told you
  before, and proved it too, and now will again, that the exclusion of the
  fleshly seed from this Covenant and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, which was taken into the
  first, doth not lessen or straiten the grace of God under it at all, not render
  this covenant worse then the first contrary to <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. the place
  twice quoted by you, where its called a better, for the meliority there spoken
  of of this covenant above that, lies not so much in the extension of the grace
  of it to such subjects, as in the meliority of its promises, for this is a
  better covenant still then the other, who ere it belongs or belongs not to,
  forasmuch as it makes better promises then the other <hi>viz.</hi> of a
  heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and all spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blessings in and by Iesus through
  faith, when that promised an earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> onely, and certain
  temporal blessings therein, on performance of those tedious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the
  law.</p>
               <p>Tis true, theirs in this sense, and thus farre was a Covenant of
  great grace too, as twas made freely to that people above other nations (for he
  did not so to any people else) concerning outward benefits, and such statutes
  and judgements, as should on their observation of them, not onely continue them
  therein, but as a shadow, type and schoolmaster conduct them to this: yet
  greater is the glory of the Gospel covenant, which now is, so that the other
  had no glory in respect of this glory that excelleth, therefore the grace of
  God under the covenant, to them that are under it, is greater also.</p>
               <p>Besides, if you speak not onely of the <hi>intention,</hi> but
  <hi>extension</hi> of the grace of God in this Covenant, and in the
  administration of it too, it goes beyond the other, for not only is the Gospel
  a clearer promulgation of the eternal covenant, <pb n="267" facs="tcp:42067:138"/> then
  that typical covenant was, whereby the glory of it may be seen more plainly,
  and with open face, then when it was seen onely in the type as a thing to come
  (for we preach <hi>Christum exhibitum</hi> Christ crucified, a sacrifice
  already offered, and baptize and break bread in token hereof, but they (and
  that in much dimnesse too) <hi>Christum exhibendum,</hi> a <hi>Messiah</hi> to
  come, he was veiled, though seen through the veil in the old, but revealed in
  this new dispensation) but also it is of larger extent in respect of the
  subject to which it belongs, for the revelation of it by preaching, and real
  proferring of the grate of it in the name of God (who is not willing that any
  should perish, and fail of his grace unlesse they will) is to all people in the
  world: the old administration of circumcision, and other perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of that
  covenant, which was the type of this, was limitted and narrowed into a little
  corner, the land of Israel, the people of the Iews, yea more the very new
  covenant administration that we are now under, as preaching, baptizing &amp;c.
  while the old covenant did continue (as it did for two or three year after the
  beginning of this by <hi>Iohn,</hi> till <hi>Christ</hi> crucified) was
  streitned exceedingly above what it is among us, for saith <hi>Christ</hi>
  then, <hi>go not into any way of the Gentiles,</hi> but now since Christ
  crucified its extended freely to every nation, and every person in it of
  capacity, of years to receive it (and till then (dying before) they shall
  ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be damned for rejecting it) without any exception, as they believe, for
  <hi>go</hi> (saith he) <hi>into all the world &amp;c.</hi> Mark. 16 Mat. 28.
  then circumcision was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to males among the Iews, but Christ and baptism
  is to Jew and Gentile, male and female w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the administration of baptism by taking in the females, that were
  not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, then straitned by the denial of it to infants in their
  infancy onely, for even those also may be baptized too if they will, when they
  come to years: the grace of the new covenant therefore is even thus as well as
  otherwise better then the old, in respect of the extent of it, and its
  administration also to more subjects, for the Jews onely were the subjects of
  that grace, and heirs by promise of the earth ly <hi>Canaan,</hi> but all the
  world are heirs of heaven by promise according as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe the
  Gospel,</p>
               <p>Besides, if you think that ever God took the whole body of that
  nation Israel, that belonged all to the typical salvation of the old covenant,
  into the covenant of everlasting salvation by C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  own, and thence conclude that the whole body of believers seed must be by faith
  of their parents admitted into that same Covenant of the Gospel, this is a meer

  some priests of the Iews dreamed of it as well as you, for which they were

  16. 17. 18. <pb n="270" facs="tcp:42067:140"/> 19. you strenuously contend it, yea and (to
  say the truth) tis well nigh the whole businese of your book to assert and
  assay to prove it, that faith comes to infants in their infancy, and to make it
  appear to us (as well as you can by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction) that infants do
  believe.</p>
               <p>Moreover, (if ever men were troubled with the <hi>simples,</hi>
  I think you are) is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism Gods seal of an estate, i. e. the heavenly
  inheritance made over to infants in their cradels? and is that seal of his firm
  to, i. e, so sure that it cannot fail? then I wonder how that seal, (for so you
  still stile circumcision and baptism) is made void and infirm to so many Iews
  and Christian people as it is, for not all, yea few of many do obtain that
  estate at last, and that most lose it for all that seal, you tell us by their
  unbelief: but I had thought you had been of the mind, when you wrote your 4th
  page, that children of Iews, and of believing parents did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all without
  any exception; for asserting it there positively that the Iews chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren did
  believe, and consequently that believers children do now, you prove the
  Antecedent <hi>viz.</hi> that the Iews children did believe, because God did
  witnesse it by setting to his seal circumcision, which if it were Gods seal to
  them of their eternall salvation by faith, and witnesse to the world that they
  had faith also, that seal must be firm, and that testimony true concerning them
  all, being set to all as well as some, so that unlesse they depart from the
  faith, which you say God who cannot ly, witnessed they once had (and that your
  principle of not falling from faith will in no wise give way too) they could
  not possibly void it by unbelief, and so must necessarily and universally
  obtain the inheritance: but sith tis most clear you selves also yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it,
  that they do not, therefore assuredly one of these must be true <hi>viz.</hi>
  either that circumcision was not to infants in their cradels Gods seal of their
  eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (as you say it was) or else that that seal of God is not
  firm (as you attest it is) or else that God did not witnesse by it that those
  to whom it was set had faith (as you say he did) or else that Gods witnesse and
  testimony was not true which were blasphemy to think) or else that they fell
  from that faith, which at first they had in infancy; and at the time of their
  circumcision (and that self confutes you in another case) among all which grant
  which you will to be true, you must contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and convict your selves of
  falshood.</p>
               <p>And lastly, if the end of Gods setting baptism to persons be no
  other then the very same with that of making his promises, and sending his son,
  meerly to let them know how he would have received them, how sure his mercies
  should have been unto them, but they would not, (not to speak of your telling
  truth here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares <hi>viz.</hi> that mans own will rejecting God first, and
  not Gods own will first rejecting them without respect to their fore-seen
  rejection of him in time, is the true cause of their condemnation) then as God
  makes his promises to all, and sends his son in his love a Saviour to all, so
  baptism should be dispensed to all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, belonging as well as
  Christ himself, tell they appear finally to reject him, to every one as well as
  any one in the world, but that being denied by both you and us, doth shew that
  the end of baptizing a person is somewhat more <hi>viz.</hi> not to beget him
  to the faith before he doth, but to improve him in it when he doth believe.</p>
               <p>To conclude, this whole train of stuff or long tail of that
  short shower of shot that went before it, is not of so much force as a scottish
  mist, nor scarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to wet a naked man to the skin, therefore bear with

  is not by faith, and so destroy the Covenant of the Gospel; till when, they

  themselves, that the denyal of baptism to them denies all hope of their
  salvation that they may be saved nevertheless, though they die unbaptized, so
  that whether we, who hold that to them all belongs the kingdome of heaven
  though they neither believe nor are baptized before they die, or you that hold
  no salvation to them without faith, and yet hold that all of them have not, nay
  that very few of them (for how few are believers infants to others?) have
  faith, whether we or you I say do <hi>justly deserve the censure of damning
  all, or at least innumerable infants dying, contrary to that evident te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
  of Scripture, and sentence of our Saviour, that to them belongeth the kingdome
  of heaven,</hi> and contrary also to the rule of <hi>Christian charity</hi> set
  us by your selves, which is to <hi>presume well</hi> of every infant that he is
  in a good estate, till he appear to be in a bad, and <hi>by actual sin to bar
  himself, and deserve ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the general state of little children
  declared in Scripture,</hi> which is this that they have <hi>right to the
  kingdome,</hi> let the most simple, but honest Reader judge between us.</p>
               <p>As for the two texts you say are brought in proof of
  justification of infants with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith <hi>viz. Rom. 5. 18. Rom.</hi> 11. 7.
  who urges the last of them I know not, for my part I take it to be of no
  tendency at all either to your purpose or ours, therefore I shall not trouble
  my self with it, but the first of them, which you say is so directly against
  us, tis because you are blind, if you do not perceive it to be an express
  downright declaration of a general justification of all from <hi>Adams</hi>
  sin, as to life, i. e. a resurrection from that bodily death, which that sin
  brought upon all mankind, and from which as there is now a universal return of
  every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al by Christ, so there had never bin any returning for any one
  man in the world, but by Christ to all eternity world without end, 1
  <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21. 22.</p>
               <p>Yea as universally as that judgement or condemnation to that
  first death came by <hi>Adam</hi> upon all men, so that it spreads its black
  wings upon them all, and brings them all down to the dust from whence they
  came, so universally is justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto life i. e the benefit and
  resurrection from that death, from which else no one man should ever have
  risen, come by Christ upon all men, really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not onely so, but a
  capacity also, and possibility of eternal happinesse and well being after that
  resurrection, and all this whether persons believe it yea or no, yea and a
  promise and certainty of it in case of belief in this Christ, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise indeed
  a losse of the Resurrections becoming a mercy, and benefit to them, and a
  lyablenesse even after that escape of the first death, that came by the first
  <hi>Adam,</hi> to a sorer, even that second death, that lake of fire, which by
  the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> by whom comes eternal blessednesse on believers,
  comes upon all unbelievers, and that for ever.</p>
               <p>So that if there be no salvation to infants without
  justification, yet thers justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of infants without faith, or baptism
  either.</p>
               <p>And whereas you argue from the cart to the horse, from the
  justification and salvation of infants to their faith, I argue from their non
  capacity to believe to their justification and salvation without it: no
  salvation or justification without faith, say you, but infants are justified
  and saved therefore they believe: if no justification and salvation without
  faith, say I, infants, who cannot believe can <pb n="275" facs="tcp:42067:142"/> neither be
  justified nor saved: but infants, so farre as they need justification, for they
  have no sins of their own, are justified and saved also, for the kingdome of
  heaven belongs to them, therefore there is justification and salvation for
  infants without faith.</p>
               <p>To conclude therefore: this opinion of you adversaries to the
  truth, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows no salvation to infants without faith, puts you miserably
  to your shifts <hi>viz.</hi> either to find out a new way of coming by faith,
  which <hi>Paul</hi> saies comes onely by nearing, or else to damn innumerable
  dying infants, who whilest they lived, were uncapable to hear the word
  preached, and so to believe, or else as you do p. 18. to dream out a new kind
  of hearing, whereby infants come by their faith, <hi>viz.</hi> an inward,
  wonderful miraculous hearing of some voice of the spirit within, such a sigment
  of your own brains, as the Scripture is wholly silent in, and no true Church of
  God, nor rational man, but your selves, who dream dreams, and divine false
  divinations, and things of nought, deceits of your own heart, and tell them to
  the deceiving of others, did ever dream of; and whosoever shall consider the
  imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies of your proofs in a cause of so great consequence, shall have
  just cause to suspect all your other doctrines, and to take heed how they take
  any thing any more upon trust, as the whole world hath done now of old, from
  these new masters, the Clergy, who instead of being ministers in truth, or
  <hi>servi servorum dei,</hi> have bin <hi>domini dominorum</hi> Lords over the
  heritage, and over the faith of all civil powers and people, teaching them
  instead, of the true doctrine of the old ministers, the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and
  commandements of men.</p>
               <p>And so I have done both with the head of this third argument,
  and with that long tail also that trails after, there remains no more of it to
  be meddled with but a certain slender sting that sticks to this tail, put forth
  against us, with more length then strength, in prosecution of the argument,
  which I shall cut out into many pieces, and after set upon each section
  severally, and then I hope your great hope of help from these three unworthies,
  will prove a <hi>forlorn hope</hi> indeed.</p>

  contradict it, while they tell us that there is but one way whereby faith

  can do it, therefore though the manner how he doth it is not known to us, yet
  we must not meddle further then to believe it is, leaving the manner of doing
  it to him.</p>
               <p>Moreover Sirs, assure your selves of this that in some sort the
  manner is usually manifested to us in the word, as well as the matter of such
  things, as we are there called upon to believe, even that miraculous work of
  the resurrection of the body, which is your present instance, wherein 1
  <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 35. to the end. the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendeth at large to explain
  the manner of it, as well as to prove the matter of it before: and whereas you
  say you leave the manner of the doing things when it is nor clear to you, to
  the spirit himself, whose the work is, in other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, I wonder
  you are so forgetful as to bear such false witnesse as this against your
  selves, when as in the point of dying infants salvation, which for the matter
  of it is so clear, that you cannot deny it, though not clear to you in the
  manner, you leave not the manner of it to God himself, whose work it is to save
  them, but limit him to the way of Church-membership faith, baptism, and
  holinesse &amp;c. whereas the word, that was not at all for infants
  instruction, declares to men and women what way he will save them in, asking in
  many places of your book, how can infants be justified without faith? how can
  Turks and Pagans infants be saved? what hopes of our infant salvation without
  baptism? and all this too, though there is no fear of their damnation by actual
  sin, though it also ask you plainly enough, <hi>how can they believe in him of
  whom they have not heard,</hi> and consequently how can they be saved by faith?
  though it tell you also plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <hi>Act.</hi> 8. where that question is
  expressely askt what hinders &amp;c. even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they yet believe not with

  we do it not in other articles of faith.</hi>

               <p>And whereas you say the renovation of a soul is no lesse miracle
  then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of infants having faith, it seems you confesse it to be a
  miracle, that faith should be in infants: and for my part I fully confesse it
  with you, for surely tis such a thing as was seldome or never yet seen since
  the world began to this day: but the renovation i. e. conversion of soules of
  men, and women depraved, and corrupted (as infants never were by any actual sin
  p. 5.) is no lesse miracle indeed <pb n="279" facs="tcp:42067:144"/> then the other: for
  the one is not at all, and the other where it is, is yet no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle at all,
  but a matter that happens ever and anon in the ordinary course of things, as a
  miracle doth not, and besides you are of those I am sure, who are in the mind
  that miracles are ceased.</p>
               <p>And lastly, for you to sprinkle all the new born infants in all
  the Christian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at this hour, as taking it for granted that these all
  have faith (for so you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (though you see not any individual or

  i. e. a marvelous work and a wonder that ever the wisdome of wise men should so

  other things our Divines use to reply, that in matters of religion, and faith,

               <p>
                  <hi>For even therefore was reason given us of God, that we might

  that though some Divines proclaim it to the whole world (for so do your selves

  see not good ground in reason to believe what they believe, can never be
  alwayes ready (as every Christian ought) to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a reasonable answer to such
  as ask them a Reason of the faith that is in them, and are at best but implicit
  in believing, so they, who believe not only without, and beyond, but even
  against Reason it self, opposing them in their faith, are most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
  believers indeed: and such as shall find, that Reason (as easily as they think
  tis answered) will make good what objection it makes against the most
  un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable of them all: but to leave this, and to come to the discourse or
  ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination it self, which followes between Reason and reasonlese, for what
  else can I fitly stile such an Antagonist, as stiffens himself against Reason,
  and counts it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to refute it? yea tis done here in your Review for

               <p>Good Sirs, consider what a reasonlesse reply to reason this
  is.</p>
               <p>For if by faith you mean only a faculty of believing, what ever
  in time may be told them, which is the adaequate object of faith in general,
  that is in all reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures: and is <hi>de esse</hi> to them,
  universally, innate in them, as a part of the rationall soul, as well as the
  faculty of remembring what in time they may hear, and of willing, and chosing
  what in time may be propounded to them, and of understanding what in time may
  be taught them; but what is all this to your purpose, who plead faiths being in
  some infants onely, not in all: when as faith in that sense is as much in all
  infants as in some, and would (if it could at all entitle such as have it to
  baptism) entitle all mankind to baptism as well as some, sith all have the
  faculty of believing things (as beasts which are meerly sensitive have not)
  flowing naturally from the rationall soul in man?</p>
               <p>But if by faith you mean restrictively, that faith in special,
  whose adequate object is the word of God preached, in the promise and precept
  of it, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes us subjects of salvation and baptism, dare you say
  that tis of equal neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, and certainty that faith in such a sense is in
  infants, as the faculty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and understanding is? so that by the same
  Reason that we deny one of these to be in them, it may be therefore denied that
  they have the other? and that their non knowledge of good or evill will as much
  prove them to be habitually no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creatures, as it proves them to be
  habitually no true believers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?</p>
               <p>For shame <hi>Sirs</hi> blot out and abjure this absurdity, for
  you cannot but know that the faculty of understanding in man is <hi>Habitus a
  natur â innatus,</hi> a habit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in them in very nature, yea in
  all mankind necessarily, <hi>&amp; qua id ipsum:</hi> but your selves say
  faith, in the sense in which we speak of it, is but <hi>Habitus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusus,</hi>
  a habit infused, and that into some only, for all say you have it not, and I
  say tis <hi>Habitus acquisitus,</hi> rather an acquired habit, which comes if
  not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gift of God to persons therein, yet also in that way of
  hearing the word, which on our parts is first done, in order to its being
  begotten in us, whereby we come to know good and evil first, i.e. to be
  convinced of sin and guilt in our selves, and righteousness and mercy in God,
  through Jesus Christ, and then to have faith in him to justification: in this
  therefore <hi>Reason</hi> remains unrefuted, and rather routs you, then is
  routed by you.</p>

               <p>Had circumcision bin administred on perswasion that the subjects

  daughter: but twas not dispensed as you senselessly suppose it was on
  supposition of its subjects having faith: for as there was not present evidence
  to any body that any of those infants that were signed had faith, so (for all
  your childish conclusion p. 4. that the children of the Jewes had faith,
  witness their circumcision, therefore the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believing parents have
  now) by future experience twas evident to every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that they had it not: how
  else came they to be complained on in general, when at years, as a body of
  wicked ones, and unbelievers, unlesse you will say they lost, and fell from
  their faith, as I am sure you dare not, and for my part I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say they did,
  except I could see more clearly then yet I do see, or you can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make me see
  that at first they had it.</p>
               <p>As for your further following <hi>flim-flam,</hi> wherein you
  tell us that we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faith to be in the best of Gods children, as well as
  in little children, if their sense under the cross and their complaining of it
  be an Argument to conclude against their faith; I give you to understand Sirs,
  that its an ignorant inconsequence, and so you will your selves discern it to
  be, by then you have weighed what a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is, between that
  voluntary submission, which by the power of faith in the Saintsis acted, and
  yielded to the cross, and yoak of Christ, in either cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision or baptism,
  or any other difficult duty, or dispensation, service or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering they are
  called to for Christs sake, and that forced and not more unpleasant then
  unwelcome imposition of it, that is made when that cross, or yoak, viz. the
  affliction, or pain of circumcision or baptism, is put upon the necks of
  infants, for the one freely choses it, when they have the liberty to refuse and
  decline it, if they please, and therefore though they have some sense out to
  the flesh, no afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being joyous, but grievous, yet are so far from
  complaining of it, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comply with it of their own accord, as
  counting it better then to be without it, witnesse <hi>Moses,</hi> who by faith
  chose rather affliction and rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>oach with <hi>Christ,</hi> as deeming these better then the
  pleasures and treasures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which were at his choice as well as
  these; but the other, i. e. infants are so far from offering themselves to
  either dutie, or difficulty for Christ, as by faith esteeming it better so to
  do then to escape, that they rather are solely sensible of the smart, so as to
  gainsay, refuse and avoid it what they can, but onely that will they nill they,
  men make them bear it, and cross them whether they will or no; neither can
  infants by faith choose, well-come or delight in either the disease that is by
  dipping, or the sore that seconds circumcision, but suffer both full sore
  against their wills; and whereas you say the sense of the cross may conclude
  against the weaknesse of faith, not against the being: that clause reasons
  <hi>Reasonlesly</hi> against <hi>Reason</hi> indeed, for it hath neither good
  sense nor reason in it to your own purpose, or ours either: the best I can make
  on it for your turn is to suppose it a meer mistake, and thats the least a man
  so concerned to meddle with it as I am, can well say of it, for surely Sirs if
  I read it right, you write it wrong, and set down your mind in words, the sense
  whereof is just contrary to your meaning: for certainly you would or at least

  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:42067:147"/> at your ignorance in this, specially since your selves

  reasonable creatures, and yet that few, not one of many infants are habitually
  believers, as namely the infants of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers onely.</p>
               <p>Secondly I blush at your rudenesse and folly in this also in
  that you assert, that not one infant of millions should give any testimony of

  children never shew themselves to be risible, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reasonable

  that is to be produced by teaching, or to know their letters, or to read, or

  it, that teaching and learning is not onely for the further bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of

  de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but also for the begetting of some habits in us that never were

  and innate habits, as the faculty of reason and understanding, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
  is not for the engendring, but improving of these in us, but all such kind of
  habits as faith is <hi>viz.</hi> acquired habits; teaching tends not onely, to
  the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of such <hi>a posteriori</hi> after they are once begun, but
  <hi>a priori</hi> also to the very being, and begetting of these, whether they
  be habits about matters of this life, <pb n="286" facs="tcp:42067:148"/> or that to come,
  tis true therefore learning is to be continued for the perfecting of habits
  begun, and begotten in a man, otherwise indeed (as you say) one of 24 years,
  having once received the faith, need be taught no more, but it is to be also
  for the beginning and begetting of faith in him, otherwise to one at 24 years
  of age having not yet received it, the faith is preacht by you in vain that he
  may receive it.</p>
               <p>There is a teaching to beget grace and faith where it is not,
  and a teaching to increase it where it is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. 19. a teaching
  before, and a teaching after faith and baptism, and if you ask a reason of both
  these, the one is to beget faith into both the habit, and the act, the other to
  build it up into higher degrees, the second teaching indeed supposes a being of
  it in men, the first teaching no being of it as yet when you begin first to
  preach to them, for your preaching speaks to them as to unbelievers: whereupon
  this argument holds good, that if ever they had faith in their infancy, they
  have lost it now, for why else are they taught the element of it? why taught in
  order to the receiving it? for reason in this objection must be understood as
  speaking suppositively onely i. e. in case persons had faith in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy its
  now lost, why else are they taught to this end that they might have it? but not
  so positively as your expressions represent it, as if reason did really assert
  that infants do lose any faith they had in infancy, for howbeit reason
  acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that such in whom faith is, may lose it if they look not to it,
  yet reason knows well enough that those can never be said to lose faith, in
  whom faith never was at all.</p>

  it can work. 2. That the Spirit of God infuses this habit. 3. That he is not
  bound to work it in the children of Christian parents, nor barred from working
  it in any of the children of infidels. 4. Whersoever this habit is, it

  is not bound nor barred, there can be no conclusion made. 2. That in those

               <p>I speak not of a few faults, which in the first part of it

  those that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed this rambling responsion, the major part of which, whether
  it past from you willingly, and ingenuously, or rashly, and unadvisedly rather
  I know not, is a most flat unsaying of most of that you have said before; and
  much of what you say again in the next page after, and an acknowledgement of
  the clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, which you have hitherto tugged for, and which you
  persue the proof of well-nigh throughout your whole Pamphlet, an absolute
  overturning of the basis on which your book builds infants baptism, which is
  this assertion, viz. <hi>That it sufficiently appears that these little infants
  in particular have faith,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning infants of believers in
  contradistinction to those of Turks and Pagans, whom as concerning their

  for that little which seems not so directly for us, though by reason of, not
  the profundity (for tis shallow enough) but the darkness, and muddiness of the
  matter, it be hard to see clearly to the bottom of it, yet if I do truly sound
  the sense of it, and reach to the utmost of your meaning in it, it seemes to
  speak as li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tle for your
  selves.</p>
               <p>You tell us first, that an Argument from comparison is subject
  to many obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and cannot hold, unlesse <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> be
  first proved; whereby you subject the most of your own Arguments in the present
  point to exception, for I appeal to your selves, and all men to judge, whether
  they are not mostly drawn from comparisons between the children of the Jewes,
  and the children of Gentile believers, the circumcision of the one, and baptism
  of the other; and yet <hi>caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris paribus</hi> is not at all proved by you to
  this hour, nor yet ever can be, sith <hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris imparibus,</hi> I mean
  disagreement almost in all things between Jewes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Christians,
  between circumcision and baptism is so manifestly made appear by us, that there
  hardly appears any analogy at all between them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,</p>
               <p>Secondly, So far as to the freeing of this Argument from
  comparison between infidels and Christians infants, so as that it may hold
  without any exception, <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> is granted by your selves, for
  if by this parity in other things you mean an equality of souls by creation,
  your selves assert that parity but a page above, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 16. where you
  say <hi>all souls are equall in their creation,</hi> and so the souls of
  believers and unbelievers infants.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, If by parity in other things, which you would have
  proved, you mean an equallity in their natural capacities, and endowments of
  wit and ingenuity, then either there is such a <hi>parity</hi> in infants of
  Christians and infidels, or else so far as <hi>disparity</hi> is, the
  excellency may much rather of the two be supposed to be in the children of
  Christians, in whom yet <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> suppose them to have the
  same education, and instruction, there is no more inclination to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in
  Christ by verrue of any habit of faith infused into them in infancy above the
  other, then there is in the children of <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next you tell us, <hi>If the Objector had considered &amp;c. he
  would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thus as he doth,</hi> The objector you say is
  <hi>Reason,</hi> so that <hi>Reason</hi> belike was much besides it self in
  arguing so unreasonably against your fiction of faith in the Infants of
  Christians; but what if <hi>Reason</hi> should consider the very same, that you
  here wish it would, must its conclusion against the belief of believers infants
  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:42067:149"/> be thereupon ere a whit the more unconcluded? and what
  though among chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren born of the same Christian parents, under the same
  education, one gives a better <hi>specimen,</hi> not onely in acts of piety and
  religion, but of knowledge also, may not therefore the habit of faith be more
  groundedly denyed to be in one, then the facultie of understanding can be
  denyed to be in the other.</p>
               <p>What still Sirs? still will you make the being of faith in the
  infants of Christians of equall necessity with the being of the principle of
  reason and facultie of understanding in infants? the faculty of understanding
  is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate habit necessarily to be concluded, and that in the highest degree
  to be in all infants, tis <hi>in omni, per se, quâ ipsum,</hi> but faith
  in Christ is by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, but an infused habit, and by your own
  confession as not in all infants, so in you know not which, and which not till
  you see them act it: and yet by your own conclusion (to go round again) tis in
  such not in such, <hi>viz.</hi> not at all in <hi>Turks</hi> and
  <hi>Pagans</hi> infants (for they are all in a damnable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with you)
  but in all infants of Christians, even such as yet give no <hi>specimen</hi> of
  it, and that so necessarily, that a man may as truly deny that which is
  naturall to them, even the faculty of understanding, as deny the habit of faith
  to be in them.</p>
               <p>Next in order to a fuller, and more direct answer you prepare
  the way by a pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of six or seven positions, which you say you must
  necessarily hold, concerning two or three of which we may say its no great
  matter whether you hold them or no, for any undoubted, and infallible truth
  that is to be found in them, in the sense wherein you take them, or at least
  for any great matter of assistance, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to your cause by them, and as
  for the rest, of which you say you must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily hold them, you might have
  said rather you must necessarily yield them to us, for indeed they are the
  giving up of your cause, and no other then the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a dash with your own
  pen over all that ever you say, throughout the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of your works, as
  concerning that sufficient appearance of faith, you assert to be in believers
  infants: yea he is blind that doth not see you thereby perfectly blotting out
  again, what ever you penned in that particular with your own hands.</p>
               <p>First say you the habit of faith must be before it can work, I
  know no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of holding this for truth, neither indeed would you hold it
  but that you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine faith to be another kind of habit then it is, for there
  are more kinds of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits then one, though you speak of habit by the lump all
  along, as if you were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of but one, for heres ore and ore again,
  <hi>habit, habit, habit, habit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,</hi> but not the least hint of what
  kind of <hi>habit</hi> you mean; you are never the men that distinguish of
  habits, whereas <hi>qui bene distinguit bene docet,</hi> there being some
  habits acquired, and obtained no otherwise then by acting, and faith it self is
  such a habit, as will hardly be proved (for all your confidence in the
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) to be any other, at least to be apparent in any one, or visible to
  the view of others till some act thereof hath past the persons in whom it is,
  neither is any one in the world, that I know of habitually a believer in
  Christ, till having heard of him or his word he doth actually believe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas you say <hi>the spirit of God infuses this
  habit;</hi> I grant he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses it, if you take the word infuse in a true sense
  i. e. for begetting it in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by the preaching of the word, other infusion
  of faith (if yet that may be properly called infusion, which is a phrase rather
  of your own coining in this case) the word knows none: God indeed gives it, but
  he gives it in the way of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word of faith, in the way of hearing
  Christ preached, in which way he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave it to infants, neither is it his
  gift to them in any other. the spirit works it, but not without the use of
  means, not <hi>per saltum.</hi> and in <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ocul.</hi> i. e. so suddenly as you fancy, but by the discharge of
  that office he bears from the father to that end and purpose, towards the whole
  world, i. e. moving, striving, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading inwardly, whilest the word doth
  without, inlightning, convincing a man <pb n="289" facs="tcp:42067:149"/> of sin in
  himself, of righteousness to be had, and of a judgement to come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we
  shall be saved, or damned according as we believe, or believe not, accept, or
  neglect so great salvation; upon which motions and convictions, which are
  stricter and stronger in some then in other foure, some yield, and believe, and
  o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Gospel, and some for all this rebel and obey not, so that tis true
  the spirit thus effects the business within us yet not so as that he is said
  wholly to do it without us; he is the supreme efficient, the operative cause of
  it, but we are to be concurrent <hi>cum causa operante,</hi> we have a part to
  do as well as he, when he hath done his part towards us, i. e. to believe,
  which if we do not, he will not force us, he will go no further, nor shall he
  be blamed, but we, and we not onely blamed, but damnd for not doing it
  accordingly: but if we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and turn at his reproof; then indeed there
  is a promise of an infusion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effusion of the spirit in other i. e.
  those more special and peculiar offices, of a witnesse to our spirits, that we
  are Gods children, a seal, a comforter, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ler of the things freely given us of God, a supporter
  under sufferings &amp;c. all which it performes towards the Saints, and in
  respect of which onely its called the holy spirit of promise <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.
  13. in this manner the spirit of God in order to that sweet infusion of it self
  into us may be said (if you will call it infusion, for which a fitter word may
  be found) to infuse i. e. to work faith, other infusion of faith into men, much
  lesse into infants, or such a downright infusion as I suppose you dream on, the
  Scripture makes no mention of at all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly in that you say <hi>he is not bound to work it in all
  the children of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an parent, nor barred from working it in any of the
  children of infidels:</hi> this indeed you must necessarily hold (as you say)
  for tis undeniable truth, but in holding it you must wholly let go

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ll you held before, concerning
  believers infants appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have faith, and that in contradistinction to
  the infants of unbelievers; for first you use to say as p. 14. out of
  <hi>Act.</hi> 2. that the promise of it is to believers, and their seed, i. e.
  as believers seed, and so consequently to all, and onely their seed, not the
  seed of unbelievers: for <hi>quod convenit qua ipsum, convenit omni, soli,
  semper,</hi> belongs alwayes, to all of one sort, and not any man of another,
  and thereby you use to bind the spirit (unlesse he will bee unfaithfull) to
  work faith, as without which you think he cannot give them salvation, in all
  the seed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, for a promise that is made to such or such a seed
  <hi>(qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  <hi>Romans</hi> 4. 16. and made good (or else God that cannot lie breaketh his
  word) to all the seed to whom <hi>(as such)</hi> it is made.</p>
               <p>But sith now you say that the spirit is not bound to give faith
  and salvation to believers seed, nor barred from giving it to any of the seed
  of infidels, which is as much as to say he is at liberty from all obligation of

  confesse, that for ought you know the one hath no more ingagemeat of God to
  them by promise then the other: so that unlesse there were more warrant then
  you have to single out one from the other as the special subjects of baptism,
  and heirs of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you ought to baptize them all alike i. e. in very deed
  to let them all alone till you come, as in infancy you confesse you cannot, to
  presume what children have the habit of faith, and what have not.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>whereas you say wheresoever the habit of faith is,
  it inclines to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions, when there
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s opportunity and the season for
  bringing them forth:</hi> whether this be necessary to be held or no, yet weel
  hold it to do you a pleasure, in calling you thereby from your false cause, for
  else its like to do you more displeasure <pb n="290" facs="tcp:42067:150"/> in your cause
  of infants faith, then you well considered, when you penned and printed it: for
  wheresoever faith is, the opportunity and season for its bearing fruit, and
  working by love and other holy actions is ever present and perpetual: yea its
  never unopportune or unseasonable for him that hath faith to be acting
  obedience in one thing or other: yea <hi>if any one say I have faith and have
  not works,</hi> and holy actions, much lesse, if no inclinablenesse to holy
  actions, <hi>that faith cannot save,</hi> nor stand him instead <hi>faith
  without works being dead and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting nothing:</hi> therefore if where ever
  faith is it inclines to holy actions when opportunity and season for it is,
  then I am sure there is no faith at all in infants, for there is no opportunity
  or season at all in infancy, wherein faith is found fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in them: and if
  you will say they have faith though you have no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, and prove it
  is so because it is so, then it is a faith without works, and that faith is
  dead, unprofitable and cannot save them, <hi>Iames</hi> 2. and if so, you would
  be better opinioned towards infants in my mind, to hold them saved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
  faith, then to hold they have a faith which cannot save them, for better ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
  a whit at all then never the better.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, whereas you say that <hi>this inclination to holy
  actions is not equally alike in all, in whom the habits themselves are,</hi>
  that may be so too, yet <hi>Sampson</hi> and <hi>David</hi> are no such
  sufficient instances of it, but that more sufficient might have been given, for
  as there are many worthy things recorded which both these did by the power of
  faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. so he of whom you say he exceeded in acts of piety was
  in some things, not to say as impious, yet impious as well as the other;
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides to make comparisons between two such worthies, as doing, the one more
  good, the other lesse, both which by faith did no lesse the subdue, and in
  their times fully deliver <hi>Israel</hi> from the <hi>Philistines,</hi> for
  which the spirit is pleased to record, and recommend them both as examples to
  all ages, and rank them among others, of whom the world was not worthy, in one
  line <hi>Heb. 11. 32. caeteris paribus</hi> unproved too, such comparison (if
  any be so) is beyond all comparison odious, and subject to many exceptions, but
  be it all just as you have said it, yet as little yields it to the support of
  your infant faith, and childish baptism, as if you had said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, whereas you say <hi>that instruction of the
  understanding in matter of faith in some sort must go before any act of faith
  can be discovered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And seventhly and lastly, that no judgement of science can
  be passed i. e. true demonstration made of this habit of faith till the acts
  themselves be seen, and examined, and that</hi> a posteriore <hi>onely the
  discovery of habits is made,</hi> and then from all these preparative premises
  draw up your conclusive answer in three heads answering thus in the first place
  viz.</p>
               <p>That <hi>it cannot be certainly presumed what children have
  faith, what have not, and that the working of the spirit in that particular is
  not known to us, and ore again also that the spirit is not bound nor barred,
  and therefore there can be no conclusion made.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say tis all necessarily to be held for truth, yea tis a truth
  so preciously pertinent to our purpose against the purpose of your own
  pamphlet, that had we been to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in a little compasse all that need be
  said toward the appearance of this positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>viz.</hi> that it doth not
  sufficiently appear by any evidence of it in their infancy, that infants of
  believers have faith, any more then other infants, we could not in so few words
  have spoken so pithily to such a purpose, which when I consider, I cannot but
  wonder, and conceive you will once wonder at your selves, when your eyes are
  open, that they whose words all these are should act against them all, so
  absurdly, as to make it the biggest business throughout their book, to make it
  appear and that sufficiently, that believers infants have faith beyond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>So you say indeed both before page 5. and behind p. 19. but how
  dare you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert then that you go not about to prove certainly, but only
  probably that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers infants do believe, for verily if it be so as you say
  that God himself gives testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for them in Scripture, that these little
  infants do believe, then never say no judgement of science can be passed, no
  discovery made of the habit of faith, nor peremptory presuming what infants
  have faith, and what not till you see them act it: for Gods testimony is more
  credible then mans indeed, hath he said it and is it not so? yea verily let him
  be true, but every man a lyar; for mans own word can cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate but probability
  and charity, and not so much neither, unless he speak it from Gods word that
  believers infants do believe, and in fidels infants do not, but if God have
  said so, then cursed be he that will not believe it to be so, for if his word
  be not perfectly demonstrative, and scientifical and past all doubt, (but I
  confesse I find not a word of his concerning such a thing) then Ile never trust
  self confuting Clergy men any more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas you answer that <hi>in those children, where
  there is lesse promptness to acts of faith then in others, we cannot argue</hi>
  ad negationem habitus, <hi>because they work not equally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is this to the present question and position concerning no
  more inclinable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to holy actions in children of Christians, then of
  insidels? for those are such of whom your selves assert the one have faith, the

  there is some promptness to acts of faith appearing, differenced only
  <hi>secundum magis &amp; minus,</hi> some inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more some lesse to acts of
  faith, concerning all whom, sith those of them that have least promptness, have
  at least an apparent promptnesse to acts of faith, who denies but that they may
  have faith, though they work not equally? but whats this to the proof of more,
  or lesse inclinablenesse to holy actions among infants, who are so far from
  having some more some lesse, that even none of them have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promptnesse

  little further, and think to coop us up by your <hi>crosse interrogatory,</hi>
  you may well call it a crosse one indeed, for its a net that catches your
  selves, let us answer it which way soever you would have us.</p>
               <p>For if we say heathens infants are inclined to acts of faith,
  and should make that good against you, as we shall hardly ere trouble our
  selves to do, unlesse we did believe it to be truth, can you give any just
  account of your denial of baptism to these? yea <hi>who can forbid water why
  they may not be baptized, that have</hi> and are inclined to act faith as well
  as the other, and in whom as in those of believing parents the work is palpably
  at least possibly and probably the very same?</p>
               <p>But if we say no, infidels infants are not inclined, then we
  must take what comes on it, for you are resolved to hit us home indeed, and so
  you do, while you do that at last cast, which had you done at first, you had
  saved your selves a deal of hurt, which you have done your selves, by
  circumlocuting so long in way of proving the very <hi>Minor</hi> proposition of
  that last Argument which <hi>Reason</hi> urged against you, <hi>viz.</hi> that
  <hi>Christians children are not more inclined to actions of faith then those of
  infidels;</hi> for at last you fall flatly as your safest way to deny that
  <hi>Minor,</hi> and assert contrarily thereto, that children of Christians are
  more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to holy actions, then other children, which if it be true.</p>
               <p>First how grosly do you contradict that you say in the lines
  above, where you seem to grant that there may be more inclinablenesse in
  infidels children, and promptnesse to holy actions then in Christians?</p>
               <p>Secondly, I wonder how you come to be experienced in it, for if
  you Clergie men be all Christians, and so you are in your own account, your
  children (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting some that by the breeding you give them, grow up to the
  same stamp of Christianity you print upon them) do (for all their native holy
  inclinations) not seldome prove the lewdest and rudest of any mens children in
  a Countrey; for not onely through the Priests and Prophets own practise, but
  from their posterity too oft times prophaness goes out into all the world, or

  by hearing: a hearing tis true infants have, for they are not destitute of that
  sense, more then of seeing, and the rest: <hi>Auriculas Asini quis non

  which is only the sound of words, without the knowledge of the sense, who hath
  not, save he that is deaf but the hearing they have is neither such as
  <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of there, nor yet that heating you say they have,
  <hi>viz.</hi> an inward hearing of the voice of Christ, and the spirit opening
  their ears so as to make them learn things as adult ones do, that is a meer
  figment, of your own fancies: besides if they had such an internal hearing as
  you dream of, what were that to the matter in hand, or to the answering the
  objection, that is grounded upon the alledged Scripture, which speaks not of an
  inward but an outward hearing the word of God preached, as that by which faith
  is begotten, and without which it cannot come? out of which outward way and
  meanes if persons be brought to believe as usually as by it (and so it must
  needs be if little infants believe by the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of certain secret
  whisperings and teachings within) the spirit would not have spoken of it, as
  such an unpossible case as he doth, in saying how can they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him of
  whom they have not heard? and how hear without a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher?</p>
               <p>But say you that is the usual means, by which faith is begotten
  in adult ones but the spirit is not tyed to meanes though we are, he works
  faith in little children without the outward hearing of the word.</p>
               <p>Is it so Sirs, that the spirit is not tyed to work by means in
  little children, in the same cases, wherein he works by means in men, and
  women? I wonder then that you, whose opinion this is, should be so forgetful,
  as to teach quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to your own tenet, for verily of all the men that
  are, I know none that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the spirit, and tie him to means in his dealings
  with little infants, like unto your selves.</p>
               <p>As for us we own this position fully, and to a tittle
  <hi>viz.</hi> that what God acts at all for infants, he acts without meanes, as
  to their salvation, but as for your selves you own and disclaim this by turnes,
  according as it seems to serve your own turnes: so far as to hold it helpes to
  hold up your monstrous odd opinion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants faith, which hath no footing at
  all in Scripture, you inwardly entertain it, and outwardly proclaim it for
  undoubted truth: but when you find it makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, then tis no other
  then a figment of the Anabaptists, for when we tell you there is no right to
  baptism without faith, but infants cannot believe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause faith comes by
  hearing understandingly the word preached, which infants cannot do then such of
  you as Rantize infants on such a sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish supposition, as their having faith in
  themselves, excuse the matter thus <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The spirit is not tied to means, nor to the outward way of
  hearing the word, so but that though he begets men to faith that way, and by
  that means, yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets infants to believe without it: and such of you as
  ashamed to assert that the infants themselves have faith, do Rantize them on
  the fathers faith without their own, excuse the matter thus <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The spirit is not bound to admit infants to baptism in that same
  way wherein he admits men, <hi>viz.</hi> the way of faith, but admits infants
  to have right to it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that outward means of believing:</p>
               <p>But when we tell you faith and baptism are the way wherein, and
  the outward means by which the spirit justifies and saves men and women, but
  without this outward way of faith and baptism, he can and doth save dying
  infants, and that the spirit is not tied to the same means of belief and
  baptism, in the justifying and saving infants through Christ, by which, and
  which onely he saves men, then you plainly disclaim what you proclaimd for
  truth before <hi>viz.</hi> the spirit is not tied to means in infants, but
  works without them in infants, though not in men, and hold 
  <pb n="294" facs="tcp:42067:152"/> that he doth work by means among them so, that there is

                  </gap> of the way of belief.</p>
               <p>Thus you tie and unty, confine and lose the spirit at your
  pleasure, you give him leave, for your own lusts sake, either to approve of
  your baptism of children out of his own declared and onely approved way of
  faith, or if it be needfull as some of you think it is, for infants to believe
  in order to baptism, then to beget faith without that outward means of hearing
  the word, but though it is his own good will to justifie and save dying infants
  by Christ without the outward means of faith and baptism, there he is limitted,
  and cannot obtain your good will, he must give way to you to baptize infants,
  out of that ordinary way of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his will is that men shall be
  baptized: but he may not save infants out of the ordinary way of faith and
  baptism, wherein his will is that men by Christ shall be saved, no not by any
  means in the world.</p>
               <p>Theres but a matter of four gross, false, unsound, and absurd
  assertions in this reasonless reply, which I must intreat you to be ashamed of
  before I leave it.</p>
               <p>The first is that old piece of <hi>sing song,</hi> which is
  canted ore some three or four times before, but would be rather recanted, if
  you were not resolved on perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in perverseness; wherein you tune it out
  as if faith in Christ, and the faculty of understanding were both so
  con-naturally and con-necessarily in believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and them onely, that
  we may as rationally and safely conclude neither to be in them, as not
  both.</p>
               <p>This <hi>blue vain of artificial non-sense</hi> keeps its course
  well nigh throughout this whole discourse of yours against reason, so that
  every foot when reason alledges any thing thats clearly conclusive against the
  being of belief in Christ in believers infants, as namely their not knowing
  good and evil, their giving no testimony of faith when at years without
  instruction, nor upon instruction neither sometimes, so much as the adult
  children of unbelievers, their not having any faith at all for the most part,
  witnesse your successelessenesse in your preachings to your parishes to beget
  it, whereby it is evident, that either they never yet had it when ranti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or
  else have lost it if they had, their non inclinablenesse to believe
  <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> more then other peoples children, their
  uncapablenesse to hear the word with understanding, which is the only way and
  means, whereby the word declares faith to be given, and to be gotten, you
  answer all along <hi>(Cuckoo-like)</hi> in one tone, and thats this
  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That by the same reason we may conclude against the faculty
  of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in them, and against their having a reasonable soul,</hi> as
  if it were full as clear, and altogether as absurd to doubt that these infants
  have faith (which yet your selves confesse you cannot presume, what infants
  have, and what h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ve not) as to
  doubt that they have the reasonable soul, which is notoriously known to every
  Novice in very nature to be in all mankind by nature without exception, and
  that so also, as essentially to difference them from other creatures.</p>
               <p>The second remaining and remarkable absurdity is this viz. in
  that you most shamelessely assert that the faculty of understanding comes to
  persons by the same way and means, whereby justifying faith comes, and no other
  i. e. by hearing the word preached, for when reason argues against infants
  believing thus <hi>viz.</hi> faith comes by hearing the word of God, but
  infants cannot hear so as to understand the word of God preached,
  <hi>Ergo,</hi> not believe; you reply thus <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They might also conclude they have no faculty of
  understanding neither, for that</hi> i. e. the faculty of understanding
  <hi>comes by hearing</hi> i. e. as faith doth, O pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious piece of priestly
  prudence! did ever any; but men minded to manifest their folly to all men,
  utter such a thing, that the faculty of understanding comes, as faith in Christ
  <hi>viz.</hi> by hearing the word of God, are not the faculties of the 
  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:42067:152"/> soul of man, I say the faculties of it, i. e. the
  facultie of understanding, the faculty of the will so inseperable from it, so
  essential to it that a person is neither sooner nor longer a reasonable soul,
  then it hath these? I confesse that <hi>Plus notitiae,</hi> or <hi>acquisitio

  increase of knowledge, and the obtaining of more and more understanding may
  come by hearing, wherein the faculty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding being set on work, not
  onely exercises, but improves it self also, and comes to act it self on more
  intelligible objects then before, now newly discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, but that
  <hi>Ipsa facult as intelligendi,</hi> or <hi>ipse intellect us,</hi> the very
  faculty of understanding it self, which comes by nature, and generation, and is
  as essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in man, as the reasonable soul it self, doth come by hearing,
  is such a mess of matter, as was never heard of to this hour, nor can I
  conceive what kind of hearing any faculty of the soul can come by, sith the
  understanding and will must both be known to be in persons, and they thereby to
  be both reasonable, intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible and eligible creatures before they can be fit
  subjects to be spoken to, and before intelligible, or eligible objects can
  reasonably, seasonably, or any other wise then senslessely be propounded to
  them in preaching, neither, if at all they had such a monstrous kind of inward
  teaching from the spirit, as you talk of, can they have even that teaching,
  before they have the faculty of understanding, for that teaching must be at
  least after they have a being, but they are not in being sooner then the
  faculty of understanding hath a being in them: yea in order of time the sense
  of hearing it self is not in us before it.</p>
               <p>And howbeit the <hi>Axiome</hi> be true, if rightly taken,
  <hi>Nil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu,</hi> the
  understanding apprehends nothing, which some sense or other doth not first some
  way or other apprehend, yer still the <hi>faculty</hi> of understanding,
  whereby we <hi>conceive,</hi> and the will <hi>whereby</hi> we
  <hi>receive,</hi> begin to be in us at least as soon as the senses,
  <hi>whereby</hi> we <hi>outwardly perceive</hi> i. e. as we our selves begin to
  be.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, other ridiculous <hi>silly</hi> stuff, that with the
  rest this section is stufft with, is this, in that <hi>you</hi> would seem to
  make the spirits converting, and begetting little children to faith to be some
  strange miraculous, and more marvellous piece of businesse then his converting
  and begetting faith in grown persons, because in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants he uses not that
  ordinary means, whereby he converts men; <hi>without the outward preaching of
  the word</hi> (say you) <hi>he works faith in little children, his manner of
  working</hi> i. e. in little children <hi>is miraculous,</hi> and yet when all
  comes to all, instead of proving (as one might very well expect <hi>you</hi>
  should do) that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of infants is such a different, transcendent
  and wonderfull matter, ore that of men is, <hi>you</hi> confesse plainly in the
  <hi>very</hi> next words, that the conversion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very soul, is a matter as
  miraculous as that: as also above p. 16. where <hi>your</hi> words are these,
  <hi>the renovation of a soul</hi> (meaning of any soules of either adult ones,
  or infants) <hi>is no lesse a miracle then that of the resurrection of the
  dead,</hi> which <hi>you</hi> mind us of here also, saying, enough hath been
  said to that before, and I say too much, unlesse it were bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ter, for they are both alike
  egregiously absurd, and full of falshood: as for the conversion of infants, at
  7. or 8. 9. or 10. daies old, for then <hi>you</hi> sprinkle them upon that
  account, tis a figment, a meer <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> and yet I can hardly call
  it so, so little reason is in it, unlesse I may call a <hi>non entity</hi> so,
  or that which never hath a being any further then in the brains that broac hit,
  in a word nothing at all, and therefore no miraculous thing at all, for that
  which is not, is not a miracle: and for the conversion of men unto the faith of
  Christ, it is so far from being miraculous, that of the two, though indeed
  nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is properly a miracle, it is more to be admired rather, that
  no more persons are converted, and that considering the pains, patience, and
  goodnesse of God, that leads to repentance, the plain dispensations of himself
  to men in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and threats, and discoveries of the way of their peace,
  they should yet be so obstinate and unbelieving.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:42067:153"/> It was wonderful and marvellous indeed
  that the Jewes (for the most part) did not believe in the wildernesse, for all
  they saw so many of Gods wonderfull works; but no wonder that some few of them
  did: <hi>herein is a marvellous thing that ye know not whence</hi> Christ
  <hi>is,</hi> i. e. own him not by faith, as the sonne of God (saith the man
  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 30.) and <hi>yet he hath opened mine eyes:</hi> twas not so
  marvelous that men believed in Christ, when they heard his words, and saw his
  works, but much rather because they believed not, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 41. tis
  wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful when Gods works are not believed though declared, yea Christ himself
  is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said to marvel at their unbelief, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 6. tis not
  marvellous that some men see and accept of excellent things, when they are
  shewn and tendred to them, but that most men seeing do not see them, much lesse
  is a persons believing as great a miracle, as the resurrection of the body from
  the dead, for then twas as great a miracle that many Jewes believed on Christ,
  when they saw him raise <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as it was that he raised him from the
  dead, which thing, who ever doth believe, I believe him in that particular to
  be a marvelous unwise man for his labor, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather no lesse then
  marvellous stupidity, that when they saw Christs marvelous works, yet for all
  that they did not believe on him.</p>
               <p>Besides if every conversion of a sinner to the faith be a
  miracle, the gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
  miracles is given to men as commonly in these daies, as in the Apostles, for
  how usual a thing is it now for men by the gift, that is in them, and given
  them from above as instruments under God (and no other were they that wrought
  mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles) to convert sinners from the evil of their waies? but that cannot be
  granted by you however, who cry out that the working of miracles was an
  extraordinary gift, that hath ceased since the times of the Apostles; finally
  the conversion of souls of men to faith by the preaching of the word is that,
  which is effected ordinarily, and therefore is not miraculous, for
  <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>miraculous</hi> are clear contrary, so that they do

  and if I could ever see such a thing at all (as neither you nor I ever did) I
  should say it were a <hi>miracle indeed,</hi> to see an infant believe on him,

               <p>I answer, that the Scripture declares the good will of Christ to

  it to the proving and making it appear that this and that particular infant
  hath faith (which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now in hand) when other infants have it not?

  every one of them have faced us once or twice a piece before page. 6. 7. 12.
  13. neverthelesse sith I meet with them here again, Ile have a word or two with
  every of them now.</p>
               <p>To the first I say thus, if the legal covenant did take in all
  children into the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church (as you say, &amp; as indeed it did) i. e. as
  well the children of unbelieving, as of believing Jewes, neither had the one of
  these a strawes more right to circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion then the other, then sith the
  Covenant of the Gospel is inlarged and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to both Jewes and
  gentiles, between whom the partition wall is broken down, and they both made
  one.</p>
               <p>And sith now by the Priests own confession it stands in the same
  way to be administred among the Jewes and Gentiles as that legal Covenant did
  for a time among the Jewes only, the Priest himself makes the covenant of the
  Gospel worse then the legal, that taking in, at least to the visible Church,
  all children of that people to whom it extended, i. e. the Jewes without any
  exception, without any respect to the parents being godly or ungodly, believers
  or unbelievers: the priests contrariwise under the Gospel Covenant, which
  extends and belongs to the whole world, i. e. both Jewes and Gentiles, 2
  <hi>Cor. 5. 19. 1 Iohn</hi> 2. 2. and to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well as one <hi>Mat.
  28. 18. Mark 16. 15. Luke</hi> 24. 47. excluding now the <hi>Major</hi> part,
  yea almost all children by their doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren 
  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:42067:155"/> of unbelieving Gentiles, of heathens, Turks and Pagans,
  and unbelieving Jewes too, which (for all their parents wickednesse, and
  unbelief) were wont to be received into the Church under the Law, and this not
  onely from the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church neither (for that were more tollerable of the
  two, and can do them no hurt, if it be all) but also from the Kingdome of
  heaven, and salvation it self in their cruel <hi>Charity,</hi> before they have
  by <hi>actuall sinne deserved to be exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I speak not as believing any infants in infancy to have
  right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the visible Church, and fellowship thereof here on
  Earth, though yet I believe all infants, as well as some, dying infants, and
  before they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served exemption and damnation by actual rebellion, to have
  according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral declaration of Scripture, right of entrance into the
  kingdome of heaven; but that I may discover the unruliness of the Priest, who
  wherein he judges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of streightning the Gospel condemnes himself, who
  undertakes to make laws, prescribe rules, impose principles upon all men, and
  yet breaks his own lawes, varies from his own rules, straggles from his own
  principles through blindness as much as any other whom he blames for it.</p>
               <p>To the second thus, if it be so indeed (as you told us once
  before it is p. 7. and here tell us over again that we may know your mind in
  it) that to deny baptism to infants before they dy, doth <hi>ipso facto</hi>
  destroy all the comforts, all the hopes that any parents can possibly have of
  the salvation of their infants, that dy unbaptized, and all the grounds of
  those hopes, i. e. all those childrens right in the covenant, and promises of
  Christ, and consequently (this necessarily followes) doth subject them
  unavoidably unto eternal damnation.</p>
               <p>Then first as I told you once or twice before, so I tell you now
  again that 'tis your selves, and not we who are the men, that say, no baptism,
  no salvation, for (say you) there is no ground for parents to hope their
  children can be saved, no though those parents be believers, though those
  children believe also themselves, and so both by birth, and by their parents
  faith, and their own faith too, have right (as you say the infants of
  Christians have) in the Covenant, and promises of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rist, yet they must damn for all this,
  if baptism be denyed them, and if they dye without it, their parents must
  mourne without hope of their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This is your judgement of Charity concerning unbaptized infants;
  even of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so believing parents, having also the habit of faith in
  themselves, for though parents believe, and believe their children to have
  faith, too and right to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet deny them baptism, and (all the other
  notwithstanding) theres no hope of them, the parents can upon no good ground be
  comfor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ed concerning them, but
  that they are damned.</p>
               <p>Tis you therefore that place such high, and migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y necessity in the bare out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
  dispensation of the ordinance, that are so for the ceremony, that hold that the
  substance doth no good without it, why else do you say that be there never so
  many grounds otherwise, on which to hope infants salvation, viz. their parents
  faith, and their own faith, and title thereby to the Covenant, which, though
  false, simple, and rotten, yet are the grounds on which you hope some dying
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants may be sav'd, though you fear the most are damn'd (for indeed the true
  grounds on which to hope the salvation of all dying infants, is there
  non-deserving exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by actual sin, and personal rebellion against the
  Gospel) why I say though there be never so much ground of hope of their
  salvation, do you say the grounds, whereupon they elsewise may be hoped to be
  saved, are all destroyed, if they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to be baptized?</p>
               <p>Moreover I tell you, that you run round, like a blind horse in a
  mill, and contradict your selves egregiously, by holding
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>uch a high necessity of infants
  ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism that theres no hope of their salvation if it be denyed them, so that
  unlesse <pb n="302" facs="tcp:42067:156"/> you recant it, youl in the end repent it that
  ere you lived your selves, and led o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers so long in such delusion; for mark
  how you mope too and fro in a mist, sometimes you say that birth of Christian
  parents, and faith in the children so born, these give right to the Covenant,
  and the promises of Christ, and so to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the kingdome of heaven,
  and their right to the promises, and the kingdome, that gives them right to
  baptism, and to entrance into the visible Church, supposing their right to
  salvation to be without baptism, and before it, as that which intitles them
  thereto, <hi>making their visible right to baptism, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church to
  depend upon their visible right to salvation,</hi> saying they must be seen by
  some thing or other distinguishing them from others, who are not heirs, to be
  heirs belonging to the kingdome, before they be signed as such, and so you
  argue, making an apparent right to baptism posteriour to their right to
  salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> to whom the thing signified i. e. heaven appears to
  belong, to them conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the sign i. e. baptism, else not, but that
  appears to belong to infants, therefore this, which is as much as to say, we
  must first look upon them, and believe them to be heirs of salvation, and upon
  that ground afterward baptize them, so <hi>making the right to the sign depend
  upon the being of the thing signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Other while again (as here) you turn the cat ith pan, and tell
  us a tale, that turns all this up side down again, and makes all their right to
  the Covenant &amp; promises of Christ, to salvation by him, to the kingdome,
  which all are according to your other opinion to be Antecedent to baptism, and
  entitling to it, so that no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent right to the Covenant, and promise, and
  kingdome, and salvation, no bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, you make I say all these, on which you
  made baptism depend before, so necessarily dependant on baptism, so subsequent
  to it, so no way appearing to belong to infants without it, that no baptism no
  title to life; deny them baptism, and entrance into the visible Church, and
  they are visibly in the kingdome of the divel, theres no hopes they can be
  saved, if their parents let them die without it, no grounds on which to hope
  it, but though believers children, and apparently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough believing themselves,
  and so thereby in apparent right to the Covenant and promise of Christ, and
  consequently of salvation, and all this before they may be baptized, yet they
  are in the visible kingdome of the divel, and do but deny bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism to them, and
  all those old evidences are worn out, their names blotted out of the book of
  life, their parents can have no hope of other then their damnation, nay all the
  grounds on which to hope that any good comes of them, are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
  destroyed.</p>
               <p>So then of the doctrine that you deliver this is the summe, in
  two round heads <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That infants right to salvation must needs be apparent, or
  else they may not be baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> (to go round again) <hi>baptism of infants
  must needs be, or else theres no apparent ground, on which to hope they can be
  saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, I tell you I marvel in my heart, it being so that such
  danger comes by denying infant baptism, that parents cannot hope they can be
  saved, how you dare for your ears delay so long as you do, sometimes a week,
  sometimes a fortnight, sometimes almost a year, as the custom of
  <hi>England</hi> was of old to baptize but twice in the year <hi>viz.</hi> at
  <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Whitsontide,</hi> and do not rather baptize your
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants so soon as they are born, least happily their lying in the visible
  kingdome of the divel longer then you need to let them, they happen to die
  before your good chear can be made, and all your kinsfolks come together, and
  then the parents be left without hope of any other, but that their children
  remain in the kingdom of the divel for ever: for persons live or dye visibly
  (say you) either in the visible Church of Christ, out of which you say also
  theres no salvation, the visible entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which is by baptism, by which
  therefore unbaptized infants never entred; or <pb n="303" facs="tcp:42067:156"/> else in
  the visible kingdome of the divel: this is one of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> diseased
  dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions p. 71. for there isno more necessity then there is of sprinkling
  infants (and thats as little, as little can be) of their being visibly in
  either, neither are they visibly in either the visible Church of Christ, or
  visible kingdome of the devill, till they are at years, but <hi>in medio
  abnegationis:</hi> you salve al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
  that danger, which I confesse is none at all in infants dying unbaptized (but
  onely that I speak accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your own principles) by telling us that tis
  not the bare omission, or neglect, but the contempt of the ordinance, that
  damnes the persons that dye without it.</p>
               <p>I tell you again, that if this may passe for true and curr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nt doctrine among those that hold
  baptism due to men and women onely, and not infants (as I scarce know how it
  should, sith neglect of known duty is damnable in a lower degree, as well as
  contempt of it is in a higher) yet however its false, silly, and nonsensical
  doctrine among you that baptize none but infants, apply it how you will: for
  the parents neglect, and the parents contempt of the ordinance as to his
  infant, is much at one i. e. neither of them damnable to the infant, unlesse
  you will hold up that saying again in the world, which God protested long since
  men should never have occasion to use any more <hi>viz.</hi> that the child
  shall die (eternally) for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sin, surely the fathers contempt doth

  I have hinted to the Reader in a shrewdshake of sicknesse, that befel me above

  shaken sheer out of my mind, and judgement concerning this way and baptism, so
  as to have recanted and renounced it, yet I call my God to witnesse, to whom
  also I give thanks for his mercy toward me in that particular, that partly by
  the more then ordinary advantages I then had, through my sequestration from all
  other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to seek the Lord, to search and try my wayes, and turn again
  unto him, partly by the more then ordinary ingagements that were then upon me
  so to do, and that seriously and sincerely, through my dayly expectation to be
  clapt up in clods of earth, till the great day of acccounts, I have bin much
  more sweetly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied since then concerning the truth of this way, then ever
  I was in all my life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, neither did I then find any cause to repent me of
  coming to Christ in it, as neither shall any, that renouncing your Rantism do
  rightly receive it, so they continue to walk uprightly in it to the end: but
  this I must confesse, I found good cause to repent of it that I had not
  honoured it so much as I might have done since <hi>I</hi> ownd it, nor walked
  so profitably, serviceably, blamelesly, holily, and worthily in it, nor so

  at work in the shape of an Angel of light in these daies, wherein his time
  growes short, and his old kingdome begins to fail him by means of the true

not half the <hi>sum</hi> of which you set down in your <hi>Account)</hi>
positively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my exception against two things in that, which you call
your baptism, <hi>viz.-</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:42067:159"/> First the false subject.</p>
            <p>Secondly the false manner of administration, together with my
ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>est desires to have
satisfaction from you concerning the latter also, as in respect of which I
proclaimed it null, as well as in respect of the former, yet you drilled away
all the time about the first without either giving out a warrant then, or
granting us your presence another day, wherein to give your warrant for the
second.</p>
            <p>In like manner at the publike dispute, which was at
<hi>Folstone</hi> before many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of people, where there was one, if not
more, of my opponents at <hi>Ashford,</hi> the Opponents part being put upon
me, much more against my expecta ion then desire, I told that <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ssis of Clergy men,</hi> who were
there, that twas most proper to direct my dispute to their practise, which sith
it was the <hi>Rantizing,</hi> and not the <hi>bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>izing</hi> of infants, I would prove that their
sprinkling of infants was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but I could at no hand be permitted to
proceed in such a way, or to come neer their copy hold in that p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nt, <hi>viz.</hi> their false form of
dispensing, though I promised to abide a whole week among them, rather than
they should not have discourse enough about the subject; at last I obtained
with much adoe a division of the question into two, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether infants were the true subject?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether sprinkling were the true manner of
baptizing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And a solemn Engagement from them, that if so be I would begin
upon the first, there should be a discourse after it upon the other.</p>
            <p>But as I forewarned the people, and that before these mens own
faces, that it would be at first, <hi>viz.</hi> that they would evade all
controversie about that, if it were possible, even so it fell out indeed at
last; for after some two hours, or little more, though it were well-nigh a
winters day yet to night, it was on their parts so uncessantly urged, that the
disputation might cease, and the people for that time be dismissed, that the
divel is blind if he did not see that day, that those who sided with him,
unseen, against the truth, did judge that there was discourse <hi>too
much,</hi> though but a little, about the Subject of baptism, and
<hi>enough,</hi> though none at all, about the form.</p>
            <p>But I let passe this, and come to prove the point now in hand,
which is this, that dipping or overwhelming in water, and not sprinkling, is
the only true form, or manner wherein baptism is to be dispensed, and without
which it is either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly no baptism, or at least none of that baptism which
is required in the word and may be owned as the ordinance of Christ.</p>
            <p>This is most plain, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n a most plain way I desire to
prove it: and first from the signification of the <hi>Greek</hi> word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is ever used in the originall, as that whereby this
ordinance is expressed, and whence it derives that denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of baptism,
the proper plain English of which is to overwhelm, or cover with water, to
plunge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ver head and ears, to put
under the water, to dipp, do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ze or
drown in the water.: and it is the derivative of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is
<hi>tinge, quod fit immergendo,</hi> to dipp in that manner, as they do that dy
cloth and colours, which is by that total submersion of things in the liquor,
as all men know they do that dy, and not by sprinkling here and there a drop of
water on them.</p>
            <p>Thus I say the word <hi>baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> signifies, and not to sprinkle; and therefore that I may
rouze all those people into a remembrance of this matter, whose Priests
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and draw them to dream that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies both
to dipp, &amp; to sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, which some, whether it be of that ignorance of the
truth that cleaves, and accrues to the common sort of Priests, through their
taking things upon trust, and tradition one from another without tryal, or of
meer malice making them willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hide the truth after they have received
the knowledge of it, I know not, God knowes, but some I say stick not still as
much as they can to make their people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; But to awaken such to some
attention to the <hi>Heterodoxness</hi> of their Priests, as well as all waies
to the <hi>Orthodoxness</hi> of them, I here summon all the 
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:42067:159"/> priests in Christendome out of either
<hi>Stephanus,</hi> or <hi>Scapula,</hi> the two <hi>Greek Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icons</hi> that
are in so great request, and of such ordinary use among you, and such friends
to your selves, as you may see by the bitter invectives of both of them
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us as <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> as a <hi>Diobolicall</hi> sect, and
therefore would favour your cause as far as in conscience they could, to shew
the contrary to what I here have said, <hi>viz.</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
either doth not signify a <hi>totall dipping</hi> of the immediate sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that is denominated baptized, or dipped by it, or that it ever signified such a
thing as <hi>sprinkling</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>Yea the word that signifies to sprinkle is another word,
<hi>viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is ever used in Scripture by the
spirit, when he speaks of such a thing as sprinkling: yea tis used three times
in one chapter, <hi>viz. Heb.</hi> 9. 13. 19. 21. and is all along englished by
sprinkling, neither is there any one place of Scripture wherein the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is rendered to baptize, or used to signify baptizing,
neither is there one Scripture wherein the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is rendred
sprinkling, or used to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify such a thing as sprinkling, nor is there any
reason why it should be so rendred, specially if you consider</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Non Identity,</hi> and deep diversity that is
between these two actions, <hi>viz. Sprinkling,</hi> and <hi>Baptizing
[Anglicè dipping]</hi> by which, as by a second Argument, its most plain
that sprinkling is not only not the baptism of Christ, but in truth no baptism
at all, and so consequently that he is properly <hi>no-Anabap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>I tell you, and you will see it at last, that as Christ hath but

                  </gap>d not two kinds of

  that one Baptism is to be dispensed, and that is <hi>baptizing [Anglicè
  dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping]</hi> and not two waies, forms or dispensations of it specifically,
  and essentially distinct from each other, so that they are not so much as in

  actions, so really different in their essentials, so specifical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diversified

  [alias dipping]</hi> do differ in the <hi>Praedicament</hi> of action: and
  therefore they cannot be called one and the same.</p>
               <p>Tis true, all things that are, are the same in general i. e.
  <hi>genere remoto,</hi> for <hi>Ens dividitur in omnia:</hi> so that all things
  that are, are equally denominated <hi>entia</hi> i. e. things that are, so a
  man and a beast <hi>in genere proximo</hi> they are both <hi>Animals,</hi> yet
  are they not so all one as that the one may be universally understood by the
  naming of the other, nor the one denominated by the other, so as to say a man
  is a beast, and a beast is a man, they are one <hi>in genere,</hi> two <hi>in

  <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, promiscuously, universally</hi> used, and done one in the
  room of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet no other then the self same thing <hi>in

  yea so as they may be properly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated one by the other, so as that <hi>in

  <hi>striking,</hi> or to <hi>smite</hi> and <hi>strike,</hi> to be
  <hi>smitten</hi> and <hi>stricken</hi> are all one, and may be denominated one
  of the other, so as that one is the other, and though here are two terms, yet
  but one thing is exprest thereby, and the sentence you place them in may be
  without non-sense, and as entirely the same as before, if you use one of them
  in the room of the other; as <hi>he mas stricken,</hi> or <hi>he was
  smitten</hi> are the same in sense: yea universally in all speech where you may
  use the word smite, you may use the word strike, and both the sense and matter
  signified thereby will still be the same:</p>
               <p>But now so it is not between <hi>sprinkling</hi> and

  all denote the very same kind of action, the very same kind of wetting with
  wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and though here be a difference in terms, yet tis in word onely not in

  essentially formal, for take any sentence of Scripture that hath (speaking of

  su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitiously to bear the name of baptizing, and then by little and little,
  till it had wholly worn it out of the world, to be practised, and passe for
  currant instead out, and this I will give you some account of too, sith I have
  given you the hint <pb n="311" facs="tcp:42067:160"/> ont, for in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time
  people being overgrown with such a superstition, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause baptism was the
  token to them of remission of their sinnes, therefore they would commonly after
  conversion delay their submission to that dispensation till toward their latter
  end, as neer as they could ghesse it approaching on them, that they might
  thereby have evidence of remission of all their sinnes at once, fearing, if
  they should be baptized before, least they should sinne again, and so spoil all
  the comfort they received by baptism, (so far were persons from posting (as
  they do now a daies) to dispense baptism in infancy to their infants, that they
  at years did too much delay their own) hereupon it came to passe not seldome,
  that the procrastinators of baptism were taken with sicknesse on a sudden, and
  confined to their beds unawares, before they could be baptized, in which case
  not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to be baptized in that manner, wherein twas usually dispensed
  i. e. by dipping in places of much water, and yet unwilling withall to dye
  without it, they sent to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who was the oracle of his time, to
  be resolved, whether in such a pressing case as this was, wherein they were as
  unwilling to die without <hi>Baptism,</hi> as uncapable to be <hi>baptized</hi>
  as they should be, it might not as well serve the turn, and be counted
  sufficient baptism to have a little water applied to them, or <hi>sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>inkled</hi> upon them in their beds?
  to this the good man being loath to leave poor sick soules upon the wrack, whom
  he saw somewhat affraid to die un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, returnes his opinion to this
  purpose <hi>viz.</hi> that in this case, wherein without manifest hazzard of
  the sick persons life it could not be so well done as it should, it should be
  done as well as it could, and that they might have some application of the
  element to them in their beds, which if they died at that time should passe for
  currant, and be counted lawful baptism:</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse (saith he himself) if they happen to be restored
  to health again, let them be had to the River, and there be dipped:</p>
               <p>He that doubts of this may read it in <hi>Cyprians</hi> own
  Epistle to <hi>Fidus,</hi> who wrote to him about the case.</p>
               <p>So that we see he judged it fit to be done ore again, to be done
  better, to be done indeed if they lived, but if they then died, he allowed it
  to be called <hi>Baptism</hi> (though it was none) in favour to the weak,
  rather then otherwise.</p>
               <p>And here now comes in the first Rise of your <hi>Rantism,</hi>
  and no small occasion I believe (if it were before begun) of the growth of your
  <hi>Babism</hi> also, for when the needle was once so clearly entred, how
  easily would the thred follow after? when it had once past through the mouth of
  a man so reverend, and respected in his generation (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> was)
  that it was baptism enough to be <hi>sprinkled</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in such a case, how
  easily might not onely every tender person that is loath to dipp the foot in
  cold water, but even every person also, that will do no more then needs must
  against the will of the flesh, mistake it so far as to make it serve the turn
  in every case? and when such an easie kind of baptism as that was, was grown
  into use, that could be no more dangerous to infants then to men, how willingly
  would all persons (specially those of that gang that grew apace a little after,
  (for <hi>Cyprian</hi> himself, and 66 Bishops more gave ground for it, when in
  a certain <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> they gave this ground for infant baptism
  <hi>viz.</hi> because, <hi>so farre as lies in us, no soul is to be
  destroyed)</hi> who held baptism in such necessity as to say it saved <hi>ex
  opero operatio)</hi> how willingly I say would they imbrace such an easie, and
  such a necessary baptism, not onely for themselves, but for their infants
  also?</p>
               <p>But to return (I pray pardon this digression) this
  <hi>sprinkling</hi> which you use is not baptism, or at least not the baptism
  of Christ <hi>(Cypriano Iudice)</hi> let <hi>Cyprian</hi> judge of it, for if
  it were, he would not have required persons to be baptized after it, in case
  conveniently they could.</p>

  not only not the baptism of Christ, but truly not any baptism at all.</p>
               <p>These two are first the true <hi>Subject,</hi> to whom Christ

  it is but one, for there is but one baptism, and not two) <hi>viz.</hi>
  believing <hi>Abrahams</hi> spiritual seed, and not a believing, nor

  is it my businesse here.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the true form in which Christ appointed baptism to be
  dispensed to believers discipled by us, which what it is you cannot be so
  ignorant as your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise proclaimes you to be, for I dare say it is not
  <hi>rantism,</hi> and you da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that it is <hi>baptism:</hi> Both these are universally wanting, as
  I have proved, to your practise, yet if but either only were wanting it were
  null enough: For</p>
               <p>First, it is most certain that a mistake in the subject, to whom
  any t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ing is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be
  done, doth so nullify that thing so appointed, that it can neither be said to
  be done as twas apponted, no nor yet that the thing appointed is done at all,
  e. g. The Parliament commanded men to take, or in ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>y those Rebells that were routed at
  <hi>Worcester,</hi> but should he have been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them as obeying their
  command, that should in persuance thereof have beaten and killed other men, who
  were never there, nor at all ingaged in the <hi>Kings</hi> cause? they ordered
  a thousand pound to him that should bring in <hi>Charles Stewart,</hi> should
  he have been rewarded as a doer of their will in that work that should have
  brought in another man in his stead? <hi>Christ</hi> hath ordained, and so
  consequently tis his ordinance that persons shal be first <hi>taught</hi> by us
  and then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, is it therefore his ordinance to baptize them who were
  never taught? the Papists have a trick to baptize (as they call it, for they do
  but rantize as you do) bells as well as babes, but if they did truly baptize
  their bells, were it the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Christ? you say no; because bells are a
  wrong subject, which Christ never appointed baptism to be dispensed to: the
  very same say we of your babies: a mistake therefore in the subject makes a
  nullity in the service, i. e. denies it to be any ordinance of Christ at
  all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, tis most certain that mistake in the matter ordained,
  so as to make another matter of it, or do distinctly some other thing instead
  of it, makes all that is done of no effect: <hi>Quod fieri non debuit factum
  valet</hi> holds onely where the errour is in <hi>accidentals,</hi> and meerly
  <hi>circumstantialls,</hi> and not in the very <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the thing
  it self: if men do one thing on their own heads instead of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that God
  bidds, they may have pardon in case they crie him mercy, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little thank
  from him for their paines: neither is he accounted, much lesse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as
  doing the ordinance of God, that doth not so much the same things that he
  ordained otherwise, but other things then he hath ordained: when the
  <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> ordained, and gave commission to have
  <hi>Canterburies</hi> head cut off, those <hi>Synodians,</hi> who also
  themselves waited to have his kingdome, would hardly have counted that
  ordinance performed had the Trustees cut off his little finger on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and let
  him go.</p>
               <p>Nor would the law little lesse then hang that executioner, that
  having strict charge to hang one man, lets him escape, and in satisfaction
  falls a whipping of another: the case is yours, who being commanded to teach
  persons, and then baptize them, and to keep the commands of Christ without spot
  till his appearing, do in his absence let go the making and baptizing
  disciples, and in place thereof only <hi>rantize</hi> and <hi>rantize</hi> only
  little infants too: in doing which, sith ye do not the thing Christ appoints,
  ye had as good do nothing.</p>

  meet in one, that are as different as things can be, for <hi>omnia corpora sunt
  substantia,</hi> yea all things are one, for <hi>omnia sunt entia,</hi> but in
  special, so that the one is <hi>in specie</hi> the same with the other, but
  this cannot be said of dipping and sprinkling, for though they are both
  wettings with water, yet are they not both baptizings, for baptizing is not the
  <hi>genus</hi> in respect to them i. e. the generall of which dipping and
  sprinkling are the special dividing members, but baptizing it self, or dipping,
  for these two are adequate each to other, is the member opposite to sprinkling,
  and and specifically different from it, under the general word wetting with
  water: so that still these are not the same so as that sprinkling can possibly
  be called bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</p>

  up, and bring them out, and save them from dying, as else they would do, under
  the water, if they should ly there after a while, and this we do in token and
  resemblance of that salvation, which Christ shews to his Saints, both under and
  after some small sufferings for him. Neverthelesse the Saints sufferings are
  not so smal, but that they are oft times totally drenched ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and
  overwhelmed (as he that is baptized in water) with tribulation, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
  scorn, ignominy, and covered therewith as with a Cloud: as we see the Saints
  complaints in this case <hi>Psal. 55. 5. horror hath overwhelmed me</hi> Psal.
  61. 2. <hi>my heart is overwhelmed</hi> Psal. 77. 5. <hi>I am troubled, my

  when he is overwhelmed, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered</hi> is the title of the Psalm, and this is
  with the waters of affliction, Psal. 124. 4. so 142. 3. -143. 4. -so see Psa.
  69. 2. 16. where there is complaints of sinking as it were <hi>over head</hi>
  and ears, <hi>in deep mire,</hi> and <hi>in deep waters,</hi> where the
  <hi>flouds overflow,</hi> and prayer for deliverance from those swallowings up
  by them, in token among other things of which continual dying in the world, as
  well as to it, and universal passing under the waters of affliction, and
  overwhelming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with here in this life, we do baptize, i. e. sink persons
  over head and ears, as well as raise them again alive, in token of their
  resurrection from all troubles at the last daie: therefore o how much of that
  precious signification, and representation, that is in true baptism is lost in
  your sprinkling, and dribling dipping the face on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which some use? In
  respect also of which plungings and overwhelmings with sufferings their
  sufferings are <hi>Metaphorically</hi> stiled a baptism <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 22.
  which <hi>Metaphor</hi> is very familiar in Scripture, which compares the
  calamities, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series the Saints suffer in this mortal life <hi>gurgitibus
  aquarum, quibus veluti mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur,</hi> to overflowing streames of water,
  wherein they are almost drownd, and therefore said to be baptized.</p>
               <p>As for the baptism with the spirit, he that shall say it is not
  such a powring out, as seasons the whole man soul and body, and every faculty
  of one and member of the other (which if it be, it may well be called a
  baptism) where in part atleast all parts are purged, but of spiritualizing of
  some parts of the man onely, suppose his face and head, not his he art hands
  and feet also, but leaving other parts of him carnal and unsanctified, is not
  yet so well seasoned as he should be with understanding in the Grace of the
  Gospel. All this therefore speaks plainly to our purpose, and so it is evident
  still that the primitive Saints were totally dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, by the bare denomination
  of baptized, which in that particular is spoken of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly it appears yet much more plainly by the subject so
  denominated in Scripture, and said to be baptized, which is their whole
  persons, for tis said they were baptized, i. e. men and women, and not their
  faces or their hands, or their feet onely; for if any member onely had been
  baptized, it could not be said properly but onely figuratively and improperly
  (and we are to take things in the most proper sense they will well bear) that
  men and women were baptized, or that their bodies were washed with water, as in
  baptism they are said to be <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when a
  denomination is made of any whole subject to be so or so, that is not wholly
  and totally so, that denomination is commonly made <hi>saltem ex majori,</hi>
  from the Major part of the subjects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so atleast, and then too it is but
  by the figure <hi>Synechdoche,</hi> whereby we must understand that by that
  whole some part onely is meant, but a denomination of a subject <hi>Ex minori
  parte,</hi> onely from some small part thereof being so, is a thing seldome or
  never used, and scarce cleared alwayes from absurdity, when it is by
  <hi>Synechdoche</hi> it self: for he that should denominate his horse white,
  and commonly call and distinguish him from all his other horses, 
  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:42067:164"/> by the name of his white horse, onely from a starre he
  hath in his forehead, when all the rest of his body is black, would be counted
  as bruitish as the horse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, specially if he should conceive himself
  speaking properly enough when he speaks so: yet little otherwise then thus do
  you speak, and think you speak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough too, whilst you commonly call
  them i. e those persons, baptized, that never had more then a little, baptism I
  cannot call it neither, but meer Rantism on their faces, from which though we
  are foold together with you by a custome of speech to afford persons that
  denomination of sprinkled at least, yet to say the truth, tis more then may be
  well challenged from us, if we should stand upon it, and plead for propriety to
  the utmost, or for denomination but <hi>ex majori,</hi> which reason would back
  us in if we should, so little of that little subject i. e. the infant, whose
  face onely you sprinkle, is sprinkled by you when all is done, but we let that
  passe:</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse, know this that totall baptizing is the onely true
  baptizing, and a subject not baptized totally may not be said to be baptized
  properly, but onely figuratively and <hi>Synechdochecally,</hi> and surely the

               <p>First, <hi>from particulars universals will not follow</hi> is a

  only, For first out of its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars <hi>coll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Secondly, Though there are cases, wherein one or some few
  singulars singled out, and considered <hi>Sigillatim</hi> apart from the rest,
  do not prove all the rest uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally so to be, as they are, as namely when
  that one, or these few particulars are extraordinarily, or (as I may

  so, <hi>e. g.</hi> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cases of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>

                  </gap>rs in fants are filled with the spirit, as well as he,
  though not so fully as he was: but these are childish consequences, and
  infantish inferences indeed, from these singulars, for the cases were singular
  cases, and notoriously known not to be incident to all.</p>
               <p>Or else when the matters in such particulars, from which we
  would argue that tis generally or universally so, are meerly <hi>fortuito,</hi>
  accidentally adventitious, not necessary <hi>per se, de essentia, &amp;
  natura</hi> thereunto, then there is no evincing a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral 
  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:42067:166"/> by it, for it followes not that because one man, or a

  matter is meerly indifferent, <hi>ad placitum,</hi> and not <hi>ex necessitate

  say some men, who were weak did eat herbs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the disciples did,
  and we all must eat no other.</p>
               <p>But again there are cases, wherein it followes from one to all,
  as when the matter spoken of that one doth agree to it, <hi>per se,</hi> and
  <hi>qua tale,</hi> then tis true <hi>de omni</hi> also, as one man
  <hi>quâ homo</hi> is a reasonable creature, <hi>Ergo</hi> all men are so;
  there are cases also, wherein the Example of what particular persons then did

  those particulars is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary &amp; no other then what by duty they
  <hi>stood</hi> bound to, &amp; that by vertue of a cleer command given out not
  to them only, but to all those that are in the same capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in common with
  them; but specially when those particulars are recorded for our instruction,
  and to be patterns and examples for us to follow, then all ought to be in
  general, as that is, and so <hi>Paul</hi> followed Christ, and others ought to
  fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him &amp; be as he was: and of this sort is the case here in hand, and
  the examples of the baptism of Christ Jesus and the Eunuch, from which we shew
  how all men (if at all) ought of right to be baptized: for though your Doctor
  disciples you (not denying in the mean while but that <hi>baptizing in Rivers
  is lawful,</hi> and mark that I pray, for it sets our baptizing in rivers out
  of the reach of all your exceptions, who snarle at it) though I say he
  disciples you blindly into a belief, that there is another baptism lawful
  besides that which Christ &amp; the Eunuch had, and that dipping in rivers is
  not so necessary to baptism, but that they may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted baptized, who
  never were dipped after such a manner, yet I tell you, through whom he being
  dead yet speaketh, that if by Rivers he means as we mean <hi>viz.</hi> any
  places where there is so much water as will well serve to dipp persons (and
  some must mean, for else it might be but a pond for ought he knew, where the
  Eunuch was dipped, for it is called but a certain water in the way) and if by
  that other lawful baptizing, then that which is received in Rivers, and places
  of much water, he mean no other then rantizing at Fonts, or as you have now
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the businesse at Basons, where there is water enough to sprinkle an
  100. but not half water enough to baptize one, you will find that at last to be
  so far off from being the same water baptism wherewith Christ and the Eunuch
  were baptized, that it doth not come so neer it as it would do, if it were (as
  the Doctor calls it) another baptism, sith it is not so much as any bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ism at all, for another baptism (such
  as <hi>Paedo-baptism</hi> would be if men did use it) would be some kind of kin
  to the baptism of Christ, they both meeting at least in the name of baptism,
  yet so little that Christ will never own it for his, but no baptism, and such
  <hi>Paedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantism</hi> is, is not so much as <hi>nomine tenus</hi> in the bare
  name of baptism any kin to Christ, but that you falsly father it on him as
  his.</p>
               <p>So that in truth our talk with you about another kind of
  baptizing then that of Christ, and the Eunuch will be but impertinent, unlesse,
  you practised ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neverthelesse for discourse sake, and in resolution to
  the question as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor states it in reference (no question) to his own
  practise, viz. <hi>whether no other baptizing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>n that which Christ and the Eunuch had is lawful?</hi>
  which is as much as to say, whether another water baptism may not serve the
  turn as well? or whether Christ hath not more water baptismes then one? I
  answer no there is, i. e. ought to be but one baptism <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. but one
  water baptisme, one kind of baptisme of that one kind, that must be the
  meaning, for else theres more i. e. more kinds of baptisme then one:

  that sure he means to be another baptizing then that <hi>Iohn</hi> and
  <hi>Philip</hi> dispensed) supposing it I say to be that other baptism he
  pleads the lawfulnesse of, yet sith Christ ownes but one, even that alienation
  were enough to discard it as unlawful, and none of Christs, as well as its
  being none at all, for <hi>new baptism</hi> and <hi>no baptism</hi> will speed
  both alike with him at last; or if he mean onely that another manner of
  baptizing in water is lawful then he hath no enemy of us in that point (save
  that we still shall differ about the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) for let any administrator take
  profest believers onely, and baptize them, i. e. overwhelm them in water, and
  let him do it where he will, yea how he will for me <hi>viz.</hi> backwards or

  though he needed no baptism, as we do, to be a token to him of the remission of

  served our Lord Iesus Christ, and that honourable Eunuch, might serve you, or
  else that easie sweet service of sprinkling which you content your selves with,
  might have served them, one of the two: for as they were required to be
  baptized no more then you, so surely in no more unwelcome a way of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
  then your selves; and they would not have so farre supererrogated as to have
  been baptized at all, if it would have fulfilled righteousnesse in that point
  to have been sprinkled onely on the forehead.</p>
               <p>Nay that would not, for saies Christ when he came to
  <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> at first refused to baptize him, <hi>Thus it
  becometh us to fulfill righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus i. e. not onely in this matter, but in this manner, but if
  you will needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this service more easily then Christ and the Eunuch
  did, perform it onely (as in sprinkling you do not) and let be done in what
  manner, or accidental form you please, and if you like not to do it openly in
  Rivers or such like places, we stand not on those nicities (though many
  thousands of Primitive Saints as well as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern were, and are so baptized) let
  it be done in a Cistern, so it be totally and truly done, yea make one big
  enough for the disciple and the dispenser to go down in both together, so that
  the one may conveniently be overwhelmed in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the other, and then let it
  be done in a <hi>bason,</hi> if you please.</p>
               <p>As for the other thing the Dr. saies <hi>viz.</hi> that there is
  no proof at all of the dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or plunging Christ and the Eunuch, but onely
  of their washing in the River I wonder the Dr. did not look into his
  <hi>Lexicon,</hi> before he asserted such an absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity as this, if he had, he
  might have fonnd <hi>cujus contrarium,</hi> that there is proof enough that
  they were dipped, or plunged in the alledged texts, but no proof at all that
  they were washed in any other way: for the very thing that is related of them
  both, is that they were dipt, plunged, or washed by dipping; tis said of Christ
  plainly <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15.

               <p>The Dr. himself grants that they went into the River, I marvel

  marvell much what they did in the river, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came out of it, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> quoth he) they were washt in the
  river, and yet not so as by dipping neither, good Sirs let us examine this a
  little, for I cannot for my life ken what washing the Dr. means, besides this
  of dipping, or how any other washing was performed.</p>
               <p>First to be sure it was not by sprinkling, which yet is all in
  all among you, and that for these reasons.</p>
               <p>First, because its most certain that the greek word
  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath no such signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as to sprinkle, neither is it
  rendred any where <hi>Aspergo,</hi> in any <hi>Lexicon</hi> 
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:42067:167"/> or any translator of the testament whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Secondly because sprinkling is no kind of washing at all,
  neither is there any thing in the world (save as I said before by sluts and
  slovens) so much as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to be washt onely by that act of sprinkling,
  much lesse by such a sparing sprinkling as yours is, who sprinkle not the 20th
  part <hi>pro toto:</hi> indeed a thing may in time be so totally wetted by a
  continued sprinkling, as it may be put ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by into some kind of capacity to be
  clensed by rubbing it while the water is on it, and that is farre from your
  practise too, but not half so well as when it is swil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in water; and in a
  long while a garment may be all covered colored, and as it were died by
  sprinkling, as Christ is said in the continued war he wages at the last, partly
  by the sprinkling of peoples blood upon him, and partly by his riding up and
  down in the wine press, where there are, as there are usually in wars,
  gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s rould in blood, and
  blood up to the horse bridles, to have his raiment all stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and his vesture
  as it were <hi>died</hi> and <hi>dipt in blood,</hi> but all this is
  <hi>hyperbolicall</hi> locution, and not to be wrested to such purpose as Mr.
  <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> do, who because there is not enough neer
  hand, fetch a proof for sprinkling fourty miles off, which yet proves nothing
  when it comes, for they know <hi>Allegories</hi> do rather illustrate then
  evince, but this is not such a deep dying as is by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it had been a most vain thing for them to have gone
  down into the River meerly to be sprinkled, if that were the onely businesse
  they might well have been dispenst with from descending into the water, but
  sith they were not, it shews that such a thing as sprinkling might excuse them,
  and if not them, I know not why it should excuse the best of us; though men do
  much in the service of God in vain, when they do things that man doth, but God
  never did require at their hands, yet we cannot think Christ did any thing in
  vain, yet so we must think if we think he went into a river to receive no more
  then sprinkling: and so we must think of the Eunuch also, of whom we have
  little reason so to think, for great folks and nobles, such as he was, love to
  do as little as may be in contradiction to the flesh, and no more then needs
  must be in this point of baptism, if at all they stoop to it: for he need not
  have hindred himself so long in his journey, nor diseased himself so much in
  his body, as to have descended out of his chariot, and after <hi>into</hi> the
  water, but might much rather have sent <hi>Philip,</hi> or his servant to have
  fetcht so much water in the hollow of his hand, as would have served very well
  to have sprinkled him, if no more then so had been required.</p>
               <p>Fourthly it had been stark non-sense for <hi>Mark</hi> to have
  said of Christ as he doth <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 9. he was baptized of <hi>Iohn
  in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> Iordan,</hi> if he were not
  dipt, or if by baptized we must understand sprinkled, for he was sprinkled into
  the River is 
  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> as absurd and
  unelegant English, as to say he was dipt into the rain.</p>
               <p>Secondly it was not by <hi>powring water</hi> upon them, that
  <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> were washed: this is the baptism Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> pretends to, as that, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which ever he saw
  dispensed in all his life, as it were disclaiming the way of sprinkling, which
  yet is your onely wonted way: I believe he saw good cause to be ashamed of
  owning that any longer for baptism, as many a one besides him is, who with him
  puts it off thus, that their baptism is not by the way of <hi>sprinkling,</hi>
  but <hi>powring of water</hi> upon the infans, <hi>for my part</hi> (saith he
  p. 134.) <hi>I may say as Mr.</hi> Blake, <hi>that I never saw a child
  sprinkled, but all that I have seen bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, had water powred on them and so
  were washed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saies p. 4. of his answer to Mr.
  <hi>Blackwood,</hi> that <hi>he never saw nor heard of any sprinkled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O the egregious shifts and shuffling evasions of these men, who
  perceiving the perverse practise of sprinkling infants summoned, and <hi>sub
  paena'd,</hi> to come to a trial by the word of God, do disguise it out of its
  old name, that it hath born with content, and without controul for ages and
  generations, and doth still among <pb n="326" facs="tcp:42067:168"/> many of their own
  party, till now they begin to see it more strictly then ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after,
  and likely to come into trouble for its transgression from Christs command) and
  shroud it under another name, whereby to secure it, so that now they know not,
  nor ever saw or heard of any such manner of thing done in all the world.</p>
               <p>No Sirs? what never? that is strange: what parts of
  <hi>Christendome</hi> have you lived, or do you live in? I profess for my part
  I have lived a Sprinkler of infants myself about some seven or eight years, not
  only in several parishes, but in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of our <hi>English
  Christendome,</hi> far distant, yet so far as I remember, I did never see till
  I came acquainted with the people, whom you nick name <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
  any thing done by any in that particular, that might well bear any other name
  then that of sprinkling, yea I know where a dispensation of baptism (as twas
  called) was done so slenderly once to the child of a noted Clergy man, that the
  father himself was so far in doubt, whether there was so much as sprinkling, or
  any water at all dropt from the fingers of the Dispenser, that he doubted a
  while after (whether he do still or no I know not) whether it were not his duty
  to have it done over again a little better; the Gentleman I speak of, if ever
  he read this, will surely remember both what, and what Child of his I mean.</p>
               <p>Mean while what more then sprinkling was ever done by myself, or
  any other in that place, or any other wherever I have been, I cannot call to
  mind, neither do I know that ever (till of late, that men see advantage lost by
  it in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy) the name of sprinkling was denyed to what was done in
  all places of <hi>England,</hi> save such where the manner was, and very newly
  is upon sight of the falsenesse of the way of sprinkling, to dippe a little
  more then the tippe of their Noses.</p>
               <p>Besides though the <hi>Rubrick</hi> did prescribe dipping as the
  onely right form, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in baptism is to be dispensed and in case of weakness
  declared it sufficient to pour water upon a child, yet what kind of powring was
  universally used by them who never used dipping, is evident by the
  <hi>Rubrick,</hi> if we will give it leave to expound itself, for in the
  Catechism thereof, which is not unknown to Mr <hi>Blake,</hi> and Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> both to have been taught or commanded to be taught all children
  at any years in all parishes of <hi>England,</hi> this question, <hi>viz.</hi>
  what is the visible sign or form in baptism? is thus resolved <hi>viz.</hi>
  water wherein the person baptized is dipped or <hi>SPRINKLED</hi> with it, in
  the name &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that how beit the Bishops were pleased to use the word
  pouring water (as you do) yet a great piece of pouring it was I promise you
  that their Priests practised to infants (and it is a chance whether Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> have not in the infancy of their
  administration, which I suppose was in the bishops reign, done the like, though
  now happily they make a little better measure, or at least seen the like at
  some time or other, but me thinks they cannot chuse but have heard of the like
  in one place of the world or other) a poor piece of pouring, I say when their
  hands onely being put into water were after held up <hi>perpendiculariter</hi>
  over the infants face, that it might be wetted a little with what fell
  <hi>guttatius</hi> from their fingers ends.</p>
               <p>And this hath been the most usual way that I have seen, in
  respect of which I may say the Priest that administred all commonly by book,
  and wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hin book, did act beside
  book, and without book in that service, for howbeit he was in joined to dip the
  child in the water, as the most expedient way at least, and not so much as to
  dispence by powring water, unlesse in case of weaknesse onely, yet he made
  bold, having an inch given him to take an ell, i. e. upon leave granted him to
  forbear dipping in time of weaknesse only, to forbear dipping altogether, and
  being authorized by the same Ghostly fathers the Bishops to make powring
  suffice instead of dipping at such time onely, wherein dipping might not be
  safely used, to make sprinkling serve instead of pouring also: and in this
  manner I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <pb n="327" facs="tcp:42067:168"/> the world was gulled by the
  <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>Cyprians</hi> daies, and after, who having the verdict
  of so grave a Father as <hi>Cyprian</hi> was, that application of water in the
  bed might stand for baptism in time of sicknesse, in case the sicknesse proved
  un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death (for if they recovered even in his judgement they ought to be had
  to the River and dipt) for ease sake to the flesh, and such like self ends,
  made some <hi>slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der slabber</hi> to stand for baptism altogether.</p>
               <p>And that sprinkling only hath been the general way of
  <hi>England</hi> its evident e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to any, save such, as seeing see not, and
  have ears and hear not: yea as shy as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> are of that name sprinkling, as blind and deaf as they would
  make themselves in this case, as though they never saw nor heard of any
  sprinkled, yet there are Divines famous in their account, who own it, some of
  which seem to speak, as if they never heard of such a thing as powring of water
  in the dispensation of baptism, but only of dipping and sprinkling as the only
  forms that ever they had the hap to hear of: w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  &amp;c. as if he had never seen water poured on a child, but all that ever he
  saw had been either dipped or sprinkled.</p>
               <p>Nay more then all this, witnesse also the very man that manages
  this very cause together with them, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> whom I
  dare say Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> have read, and made no

  <hi>Synod</hi> of Divines, who in their directory direct the world further out
  of the way of the word in point of baptism, then the Bishops in their
  <hi>Rubrick</hi> did, for they in their Liturgy appointed dipping to be done,
  as the most expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent form, and <hi>powring on water</hi> onely in case of
  necessity, but the other in theirs directly exclude dipping, as a thing no
  where appearing to be needful, and order that either of the other shall serve
  without it: for these are their words p. 45. of the Directory, <hi>viz. He is
  to baptize the child with water, which for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing it, is not only
  lawful but sufficient, and most expedient to be by powring or sprinkling of the
  water on the face of the child:</hi> whether any thing that ever hath been done
  by any in obedience to this directory in that second way <pb n="328" facs="tcp:42067:169"/>
  of sprinkling, which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> denies that he ever saw done, and Mr.
  <hi>Blake</hi> that he ever heard of as done to any, did ever reach Mr.
  <hi>Baxters</hi> eye, or Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> eare, I leave them seriously to
  examine; but this I am sure of that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of Christ and the Eunuch was
  dispensed neither by sprinkling as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above, nor yet by bare
  pouring on of water which they so plead for: and this I shall now make appear
  as plainly as the other. For</p>
               <p>First in vain did they descend into the River to have nothing
  but water poured on them with no greater spout or stream then what runs down
  contiguously from the hallow of ones hand; but Christ did nothing surely in
  vain, and <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> might well have spared their
  paines in wetting themselves so much, as they must needs do by going down both
  into the water, and as sufficiently dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged such a service by standing only
  on the shore.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if by powring you mean the powring of a farre greater
  quantity of water then what can he held in the hand, as namely out of some
  scoop, or vessel used to such a purpose upon the face or head, as that might
  have been done full as well by the water side, if they had not gon down into
  the water, so it must have been as tedious by running down into their necks and
  bosomes, and so necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have occasioned the trouble of the shifting of
  themselves, as very dipping it self can be, or do.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, twas not by washing them in any other way, excepting
  still that of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, suppose by applying water to them with their hands or
  otherwise, and then rubbing it on their bodies, for if so, then this washing
  must be of their whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or of some part or parts of them onely, if some
  part or parts onely, then of those parts which we commonly keep uncovered as
  the face and hands, or else let it be assigned what other parts, but it was not
  the face or hands onely that were thus washt, for this again were a very vain
  thing to go down into the water for, as its said of <hi>Philip</hi> and the
  <hi>Eunuch</hi> that they both did: <hi>frustra fit per plura quod potest fieri
  per pauciora:</hi> tis meer foolishnesse to fetch a beetle and wedges to cleave
  a stick no bigger then ones singer, &amp; little wisdome to run so much as ore
  shoes meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to wash ones face or hands, which may be done as well at the
  waters side, as in it: if their whole bodies were thus washt, then it must be
  done either with their clothes on, and that is impossible, for though the whole
  body may be baptized <hi>i. e.</hi> washt by dipping or swilling it under the
  water as conveniently, and more comely with clothes on then otherwise, yet they
  surely have little else to do, and find themselves more work then becomes wise
  men, that go about to wash persons by rubbing water upon them through their
  garments, besides while you can totally wash one in that form of washing, Ile
  wash by dipping at least no less then a score: or else <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ut is
  vestimentis</hi> i. e. stark naked, &amp; that were more immodest then naked
  dipping.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, nor was it done by <hi>dipping some part</hi> of their
  bodies onely into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the whole, for to dip a person but in part,
  besides that it is not properly to dipp that person, but onely to dip <hi>some
  part</hi> of him, is to the dispenser, and the disciple too,
  <hi>tantamount</hi> in difficulty if not surmounting a total dipping, yea to
  dip the whole body of a man at years (for we speak not now of infants, that may
  at ease be dandled any way in ones armes) is easie enough to the dispenser,
  when the disciple is once gon down with him into the water, and yields himself
  to be laid along in it by his hands, but conceive what part of a man you will,
  except the hands which you will not for shame say is the onely member to be
  baptized, and Ile say <hi>hic labor, hoc opus est,</hi> tis a matter of no smal
  difficulty to dip meerly that: for if you will dip a mans head and shoulders
  onely in the River, you must poise and posture him <hi>Archipodialiter</hi>
  with his heeles upwards, if his feet and legs onely, you must first at least
  lift him up wholly, and carry him in clearly from the ground, which kind of
  dipping men in Rivers, as tis more toilsome surely then that totall dipping,
  which <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> used, so let him take it, who is minded
  to make himself more moil then needs, for our parts we have a way 
  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:42067:169"/> wherein to do it with more ease, and to do it more
  sufficiently too, then by the halves.</p>
               <p>As for the other of the Dr. <hi>quibbles viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First (for the rest of them are elsewhere removed) <hi>That the
  Israelites were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in a cloud, not dipt into it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> nor sprinkled neither, but onely metaphorically
  baptized.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>that</hi> Zebedees <hi>children were baptized with
  blood, the baptism wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Christ was baptized, and yet neither he nor they
  dipt into blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Both he and they were baptized with sufferings,
  shame and contempt, and affliction, and all misery in the world for truths sake
  i. e. <hi>penè,</hi> yea <hi>penitus submersi,</hi> sunk ore head and
  ears in deep waters of the proud, going over their souls, and overwhelmed with
  the waves of the wickeds wrath, prevailing against them for a time, and thats
  the bloody baptism he speaks of, not litteral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the sprinkling of their own
  blood upon them, when they were slain, for <hi>Iohn</hi> suffered otherwise,
  but his blood was not shed at all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>that the fathers speak of the baptism of tears but
  no dipping in that baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> we mind not what your fathers spake
  <hi>hyperbolically,</hi> but what our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers spake in truth, and plain
  sobernesse in this case.</p>
               <p>It was therefore a totall dipping certainly, which was then
  used, and by which Christ and the Eunuch were baptized in the water, and not
  any other kind of washing there, as the Dr. dreames, which is also evinced yet
  a little further by this, forasmuch as though the Eunuch was gone down with
  <hi>Philip</hi> into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet he was not said to be baptized till
  <hi>Philip</hi> had dipt him therein: for if the wetting or washing, or dipping
  of some parts of the body onely might passe for sufficient baptism, then as
  soon as <hi>Philip</hi> had conducted the <hi>Eunuch</hi> into the River, he
  might have led him out again as a person sufficiently baptized, for he was
  washt already and dipt so far as to the <hi>Ancles,</hi> but the businesse was
  not done though the <hi>Eunuch</hi> was in the River, till he had baptized him
  there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into.</p>

               <p>No it cannot, for they came unto the water before, and so its
  expressely spoken in the text ver. 36. where its said, <hi>and as they went on
  their way, they came</hi> unto <hi>a certain water,</hi> (tis probable some
  foord or brook that they were to pass through) and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> said
  <hi>see here is water, what hindereth me to be baptized,</hi> if they were come
  <hi>unto</hi> the water already (as the word saies they were) they could not be
  said properly (except they had gone from it first) to come <hi>unto</hi> the
  water again after they were come <hi>unto</hi> it, therefore the next motion
  was into it without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: yea the very Dr. himself, with whom we now deal,
  confesses no lesse then this, that Christ and the Eunuch were baptized in the
  river, and that such baptism of men hath been used, if then they were used to
  be baptized <hi>in</hi> the water, they went down first certainly <hi>into</hi>

  baptized with fire, and to all those unto whom that baptism with fire is

  as well as those that were met on the day of Pentecost, (as we see
  <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. where <hi>Iohn</hi> promises the baptism with fire, as
  well as with the spirit to all penitents, most of which never had that vision
  of cloven tongues) which appearance of cloven tongues I say, is no more
  incident to, nor to be expected by all that are baptized with fire, then the
  appearance of the spirit descending in shape of a dove, and lighting upon
  Christ at the time, when he was baptized or filled with the spirit, which was
  much vvhat such another special, casual and visible token of Gods presence as

  seem congruous enough out of the mouth of the holy spirit, and the holy
  Apostles themselves, for they use it more then once, or twice in the holy
  Scripture, and me thinks he should not be, unlesse he be willingly, ignorant of
  it; for not onely doth <hi>Iohn</hi> say twice <hi>viz. Rev.</hi> 1. 10. 17. 3.

               <p>He I say who is said truly (and the spirit lies not) to be

  <hi>in</hi> it, and thats more then he needs to be in order to baptism, if he
  can be baptized as well standing by it only in that fiddling way of
  sprinkling.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore you contend against baptizing, i. e. dipping
  <hi>into</hi> Jordan <hi>into</hi> Rivers, and plead for a baptizing in water
  onely by the Example of Christs baptism <pb n="333" facs="tcp:42067:171"/> which you yield
  <hi>in</hi> Jordan, but not <hi>into</hi> it, I marvel what wide difference you
  see in these two, that you should grant it to be <hi>in,</hi> and yet be
  affraid to grant it to be <hi>into</hi> Jordan: you cry out not <hi>into,</hi>
  not <hi>into</hi> by any meanes, for that is no way consistent indeed with your
  dry washing, but by all meanes let it be <hi>in</hi> only, <hi>viz. in</hi>
  water, <hi>in</hi> the River, <hi>in</hi> Jordan: let it be <hi>in</hi> water
  then as [much as you will for me, so it be <hi>[in]</hi> water that you are

  are, whilest little or none, in comparison of such a measure of water as must
  necessarily be in order to a true baptizing of them, doth once come neer
  them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it appears plainly that the way of baptizing in the
  primitive times was by <hi>totall dipping,</hi> not <hi>sprinkling,</hi> in
  that they chose to do it in places, where there was much water, or many waters,
  which they need not have done, if sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling might then have past for
  baptizing, <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized in the River <hi>Iordan,</hi> and was
  baptizing <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 23. in <hi>Enon</hi> neer to <hi>Salem,</hi> and the
  reason is rendred thus, <hi>viz.</hi> because there was much water there, and
  there they came and were baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as the reason why they went to be
  baptized there, was because there was <hi>much water,</hi> or <hi>many
  waters</hi> (for the word is <hi>Plurall)</hi> so surely the reason, why they
  went to such a place was that they might be baptized i. e. dipped in water, as
  they could not conventently be elsewhere, at least not every were, for where
  might they not easily have bin sprinkled? and upon this account no doubt, as
  <hi>Iohn</hi> chose to preach about those River sides, <hi>viz. Iordan</hi> and
  <hi>Enon,</hi> that their conver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s
  might conveniently be baptized, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> being at
  <hi>Philippi,</hi> and abiding in that City certain daies to preach the Gospel,
  on the Sabbath, the most likely time of vacuity from other occasions for people
  to assemble to hear in, went out of the City by a Rivers side, and there sate
  down, and spake to as many as resorted thither to hear, <hi>viz.</hi> certain
  women, (for men for the most part were more shy of the Gospel as now they are)
  that they might conveniently dispense bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism to them, as should imbrace the
  Gospel, as a certain woman named <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dya,</hi> and her houshold did, and
  thereupon out of hand were all baptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 12. &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Their baptizing where there was much water for this reason,

                     </gap>ually to every person as by dipping, is a frivolous conjecture, as
  if there could be no reason, why Iohn should chose a place, where many wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
  were but that he might dipp the whole man in the water, the cause rather seems
  to be this, because waters in those hot Countryes were rare, and in some places
  could not be had in a great distance, and because there came multitudes to be
  baptized, for the dispatching of which they might well seek places of many
  waters, where</hi> John <hi>and his disciples might at once be imployed, one
  water of depth sufficient would have served for the use of dipping, for dipping
  sake he might have sought for a deep, but needed not to seek many
  waters.</hi>

               <p>The question is not whether <hi>Iohn</hi> had no reason. but
  that which we alleadge of baptizing, where there was much water, but whether
  that which we alleadge <hi>viz.</hi> that he might dipt the whole man be not

  to be baptized, and that <hi>Iohn</hi> and his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might at once be
  imployed in baptizing, that can be no reason at all of their running into
  rivers to baptize, nor of their dispensing in <hi>Iordan,</hi> In
  <hi>Enon,</hi> and in places of much water, or in <hi>many waters,</hi> and
  therefore (for ought I see yet) ours is the onely one: for verily were it not
  for the sake of totall dipping, they <pb n="334" facs="tcp:42067:172"/> need not for the
  multitudes sake that came to be baptized, nor yet for the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes sake who
  did baptize (I mean <hi>Iohn</hi> and his disciples, who no doubt were all at
  once imployed in that work) have sought for a place of much water, or many
  waters: for as one bason of water may well serve to sprinkle a whole parish of
  many persons, or if not, its easily replenisht, so many persons imployed at
  once in sprinkling might easily put their hands into one, or if not, might they
  not easily have it in many basons? what a poor shift is this? <hi>Rivers,
  Iordan, Enon, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters, and why? because many were baptizing, and many to
  be baptized; one water of depth</hi> (quoth Mr. <hi>Blake) would have served
  for the use of dipping: for dippings sake they he might have sought for a deep,
  but needed not seek many waters:</hi> but would not one water of no great
  depth, as a <hi>bason,</hi> yea of no depth at all, as a <hi>cock</hi> or
  <hi>conduit</hi> have served for the use of sprinkling 1000s? for sprinkling
  sake, even of multitudes, they need have sought for neither <hi>deep
  wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> nor for <hi>many waters</hi> neither: or if they must needs have
  had as many waters as they had dispensers, they might quickly have made

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> rejoices in Mr. <hi>Blackwoods</hi> rendring
  the word <hi>plurally viz.</hi> many waters, which the translators render in
  the singular <hi>viz.</hi> much water, supposing he hath such a prize in our
  yielding to read it so, as takes off the whole force of our reason: but I hope
  he understands himself better then to believe, that by <hi>many waters</hi> is
  meant <hi>several waters,</hi> waters in several sourses or channels
  <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim, Sigillatim, seorsim sumptae,</hi> divided and a part one from
  another, for by <hi>many waters</hi> is meant a confluence of much water
  together, many waters meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one, flowing, running contiguously, and
  contained jointly in one sourse, river, channel; otherwise in one <hi>River
  Enon</hi> it could not be said there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters, for twas but one floud,
  as <hi>Iordan</hi> was, so that by <hi>Enon,</hi> or <hi>many waters</hi> he
  must needs understand much water, a sufficiency, a competency of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the
  occasion in hand, enough to baptize i. e. to dip, and overwhelm in, and not
  several waters, for several persons at once to sprinkle in, for this might be
  done easily without much water, and if not without several waters, yet at least
  in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral basons of water onely, but the other could not: <hi>many
  shallowes</hi> were sufficient for many to <hi>Rantize,</hi> and be

  <hi>Iordan,</hi> one <hi>Enon</hi> of depth sufficient, those being onely the

               <p>Fiftly, it appears plain that the Saints in the primitive time

  given to them after baptism <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. 4. where the Romans are said to

  own the true way of baptism indeed.</p>
               <p>Your Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> little better then denies both at
  first p. 70. saying thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for the representation of the death and resurrection,
  that is not properly the inward grace signified by baptism, but the washing the
  soul in the laver of regeneration, and clensing us from our sinnes,</hi> but I
  can little lesse then admire that he above all men, who quotes the
  <hi>Rubrick</hi> with little lesse authority, then he doth the bible, and hath
  no question little lesse then an 100 times in his daies taught little children
  the <hi>catachism</hi> contained therein, should quite forget to learn it
  himself, for there its set down plainly, that the inward and spritual grace
  sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the outward sign of baptism, is death unto sinne, and a new birth
  unto Righteousnesse; and besides he knew that in true regeneration, there is a
  death and resurrection.</p>

                  <hi>However in the manner of baptism as it is administred in the

  for though the child be not alwayes dipt in water, as the rubrick prescribeth,

               <p>Whether the Drs mind misgave him or no after he had asserted

  right baptism, he rather goes another way to work <hi>viz.</hi> to patch up a
  proof of it that there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblace of a death and resurrection in that
  administration of it, that is used in <hi>England;</hi> but tis in such a way
  me thinks as may well make all the <hi>seers</hi> asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and
  <hi>Divines</hi> confounded, specially you that so dote on that Doctor as to
  give up your selves to be so blindly discipled by him (as you do and would have

  <hi>Divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It seems then you dare nor quite gainsay, but that a
  representation of a death and resurrection is fit to be made in the manner of
  baptizing, and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath prescribed that it
  shall be done in such a manner, as may be <hi>tanta mount</hi> thereto
  <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>dipping,</hi> unlesse of necessity th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ough the infants sicknesse it be done otherwise (yet
  notwithstanding that prescription of the Church, <pb n="336" facs="tcp:42067:173"/> which
  of you priests did ever do any other then sprinkle the healthiest infants?) but
  because the subject of your baptism in <hi>England,</hi> being an infant, is
  too tender at all times to be dipt or buried in water (where note that your
  false subject of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity ingages you to forgo the true way of baptizing,
  which your selves prescribe unlesse necessity forbid it) because I say the
  child cannot conveniently be buried with Christ in baptism into death in his
  own person, therefore <hi>(ecce signum)</hi> this visible death, burial, and
  resurrection with Christ must be all transacted for him <hi>per altum</hi> i.
  e. by the ministers hand, that is dipped into water, and brought out again as
  it were instead of the child.</p>
               <p>And this is even very suitable to all the rest, for all the rest
  of your service in the point of baptism is done by <hi>representatives,</hi> as
  little as it <hi>represents</hi> what is maln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be <hi>represented</hi> by
  it, and one part would mock the other is this should not be done so too: tis
  true all is done in the childs name, and in the childs stead, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done
  that of right ought to be done either by, or to the child himself: The infant
  indeed is askt, dost thou believe in God? dost thou forsake tho divel? wil:
  thou be baptized &amp;c? but others must answer, and promise, and professe,
  assent to, and vow all these for him, others mouthes must speak his mind, and
  theres the profession: again he is spoken to by the <hi>minister</hi> saying to
  him, I baptize thee i e. <hi>dip</hi> or <hi>bury</hi> thee with Christ in
  baptism into death, for so tis in a little plainer Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and true sense and
  intent of the service, but alas its nothing but the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters hand that is
  dipt, buried, raised again with the drips that hang upon which the infant is
  onely <hi>rantized,</hi> and there is the <hi>resemblance</hi> of the death,
  burial and resurrection: but I trust Sirs you will understand at last that when
  <hi>Paul</hi> saies to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Colossians</hi> that they
  were buried and raised in baptism, he doth not mean that the dispensers hands,
  but that their bodies were put under water, and brought out again, in respect
  of which they were said to be buried into death, and are raised again, i. e.
  not spiritually onely, and really in respect of the soules dying to sinne, and
  living to righreousnesse, but outwardly, visibly, bodily in water also, and
  this significatively, and representatively of the other, and this is my third
  argument for total dipping.</p>

               <p>If that be granted you will not easily withstand the other, yet

  <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Zanchee</hi> both assert it in their several

               </p>
               <p>Neverthelesse our above named opposers will at no hand give way.
  that there should be any representation or resemblance made in baptism of these
  two things, which are the prime significations of it, by putting under water
  and plucking out <pb n="337" facs="tcp:42067:173"/> again: yea they seem to chide with
  their several <hi>Ant agonists A. R.</hi> and <hi>C. B.</hi> for offering once
  to urge that the outward sign ought to hold analogy or proportion with the

  things signified, <hi>viz.</hi> a death, burial and resurrection Mr.
  <hi>Blake</hi> grants there is in our way of baptism by dipping, but that there
  need be, or should be so by institution, this he heares not of with patience,

               <p>But if it please you to have patience with me so long, sith

               <p>
                  <hi>What you go about to gather</hi> saith he <hi>from Col. 2.

                     </gap>de in the grave three daies, and then rose again, So
  your party baptized must be put under the water, abide there some considerable
  time, and then come up again, for if you presse a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Christs death
  in going down into the water, and of his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or comming up out of
  the water, why not also of his abode three daies by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding three daies or
  some considerable time, under the water? which will make bad work, neither can
  any such thing be gathered from those Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I would demand two Questions</hi> (saith he) 1. <hi>How you
  gather from these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a dipping of the whole man over head and under water?
  and that a simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Christs death, burial and rising again, to be
  represented by dipping in water, is signified here? these Scriptures shew
  indeed that the end of our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is to seal our communion with him in his
  death, and resurrection, by which we are dead to sin, and raised again to
  holinesse: but if you will presse hence a resurrection by our descending into,
  abiding in, and comming up out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, take heed least you be one of
  those, which adde to Gods word, least he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove you as a lyar, and adde unto
  you the plagues written in his book, for I know no word of God, wherein this
  representation is necessarily implyed, much lesse expressed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Besides if you urge death and resurrection to be resembled
  by deseension into, and ascension out of the water you must urge also burial,
  which is principally there expressed by the biding of the whole ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, head and all under for a time,
  answerable to Christs three daies burial, which cannot be without danger, yea
  certainty of drowning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If it should be granted that a representation and
  resemblance of Christs death, burial and resurrection is set before us in
  baptism, and so of our death to sin, and rising again to holinesse, yet I
  demand why this may not as well be by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of water as dipping? can you
  give me an example of so many killed and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by immersion, or dipping into
  the water, as I can give of them that have been put to death and buried by
  infusion of water? I am sure a whole world of men and other creatures (those
  few that were in the Ark only excepted) were buried in the universal deluge at
  once by infusion, not by dipping: so that infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or sprinkling may as well
  clearly signifie death and burial as dipping: and to the preservation of No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And then again p. 19, 20. 21. he undertakes further
  <hi>viz.</hi> to argue back again upon us at large, and to prove, that if there
  must needs be a resemblance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation in baptism of the things, that
  are signified therby, then it may be as well, nay must be rather by washing,
  pouring sprinkling then by dipping and putting under <pb n="338" facs="tcp:42067:174"/> the

  granted</hi> saith he, <hi>that in those hot countreys they commonly washt by
  going down into the water, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dipt therein, that will no more inforce a

  which was leaning and partly <hi>lying, but it may be objected</hi> (saith he)

                  <hi>Secondly, with as good reason one may plead thus, that tis
  most convenient that at the supper every communicant should receive his belly
  full of bread and wine, and take as long as his stomack and head will hold, to
  signifie the full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment of the soul with the body and blood of Christ;

               <p>
                  <hi>These outward elements of water, bread and wine are for
  spiritual use, and to signifie spiritual things, so that if there be the truth
  of things, the quantity is not to be respected further then is sufficient for
  its end, namely to represent the spiritual grace, and that it be neither so

                  <hi>Now</hi> (saith he) <hi>let any one without prejudice
  consider these Scriptures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at least some of them speak not in allusion

  exhibited in this sacrament, be ever so fully set forth by dipping, and then I

                  <hi>If by baptism</hi> saith he <hi>we are planted into the

  follow therefore that there must be some ceremony in the application of the
  water to resemble it? if you may take this liberty of argument, give me
  leave</hi> saith he <hi>to attempt the like, and with as good reason to
  conclude, that baptism must be no other then sprinkling, that 
  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:42067:174"/> there may be proportion between it, and that sprinkling
  of blood and water, that did foreshadow it: or baptism must be onely by powring
  of water, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lively representation between that and pouring out of
  the holy spirit; or that baptism must be by washing with water only, there
  being a lively proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that, and washing away of sins by Christs

               <p>Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> grants not a necessity, but an expediency at

  worth his earnest examination, he grants that in baptism we are planted into

  righteousnesse, held in the way of dipping, and in that respect I am perswaded
  judges dipping in his conscience more expedient then that of sprinkling, yet
  will no more then Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> himself allow, but denyes us the liberty to
  argue that by duty, necessity or institution, there ought to be <hi>de
  ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> any ceremony to resemble it: what little reason he hath so to do
  will appear easily, and without further proof to himself, who grants so far, if
  he consider that tis duty, and necessary for us, <hi>necessitate
  praecepti)</hi> by command, commission and institution from Christ, to do that
  ever that is most commodious and expedient; and whether it be not most
  expedient, and more then expedient too, to resemble the death and resurrection
  of Christ, and ours with him in baptism, and whether dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping be not more
  expedient then sprinkling, or any other way, and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to represent
  all those things, which are signifyed and are to be resembled in the ordinance
  of baptism, will fall under our examination by and by, when we come to consider
  what the things are that are specially signified in baptism, and how requisite
  it is that they be also represented in it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time let it be considered what is granted and denyed
  by Mr. <pb n="340" facs="tcp:42067:175"/> 
                  <hi>Cook</hi> of whom I may truly say so little
  do I ken what the man means by it, that he both grants us full as much as we
  desire, and yet denies us too no lesse then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing we would have; denying
  indeed, to the contradiction of himself, the very self same things that yet he
  grants: the truth is I know not what to call it but confusion, nor find I a way
  how to reconcile some parts of it to the rest, so full of vatiance it is within
  it self: one while he grants, asserts and argues the same in general that we
  do, <hi>viz.</hi> that the spiritual grace, or thing signified in baptism is,
  and ought to be represented, or resembled in that outward sign, and <hi>that
  respect is to be had that the outward element of water, which is to signifie
  the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing be used, as to the quantity of it, though not further, yet
  so far as may be sufficient to us end, which end</hi> (saith he mark his phrase
  in this passage p. 20) <hi>is to represent</hi> (which is as much as to say to
  resemble, or lively to set out to our eyes) <hi>that spiritual grace or thing
  signifyed, and that it be not so little as not clearly to represent it;</hi>
  yea and which is more, and as much as we say our selves he grants, and asserts
  it for undoubted truth that the spiritual grace, or thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by baptism
  is (among other things) a death and resurrection: <hi>for

  19.) <hi>but our justification and san<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ication or remission of sins together with mortification and
  vivification</hi> (which is as much as to say those two parts of our
  sanctisication, <hi>viz.</hi> our spiritual death and resurrection) <hi>are
  sealed and signifyed by baptism,</hi> i. e. are the spiritual grace of it. Also
  p. 17. <hi>these Scripiures viz.</hi> Rom. 6. Coll. 2. <hi>shew indeed</hi>
  (saith he) <hi>that the end of our baptism is to seal our communion with Christ
  in his death and resurrection, by which vve are dead to sin and raised again to
  holinesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in all this he sides so sourdly with us, and jumps so just
  into our opinioo, that if we did hire him to speak our mind for us to the
  world, we could scarce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him to propound it more plainly than he doth,
  bating only his stiling baptism by the name of a seal, instead of which I wish
  he would call it only a sign: yea he gives us all that in this case we contend
  for from those scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> that the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grace or thing
  signified in baptism is to be therein also represented, and that our death and
  resurrection by vertue of Christs is that thing that is signified there, or
  that spiritual grace the signifying of which other things not excluded) is the
  chief end of our baptism.</p>
               <p>Otherwhiles again he gain saies this grant, speaking of it
  suppositively onely as page 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>it should be granted that a
  representation and resemblance of Christs death, burial and resurrection is set
  before us in baptism, and so of our death to sin and rising again to
  holinesse,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if he were never the man that had granted, as you see he
  doth, or ever would grant, or give way to such a thing, and not only so, but as
  if he were loath, and half angry that any man should speak the truth but
  himself, or the same truth with himself, he charms <hi>A. R.</hi> and little
  lesse then charges him as a lyar, and in him consequently us all, for saying no
  other then what (if you put his sayings together) he saies himself, which is
  this, viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That our mortification and vivisi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ation by vertue of Christs death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is
  the spiritual grace or thing signifyed, and that respect or care must be had in
  the administration of it, that the quantity of water be sufficient clearly to
  represent the spiritual grace</hi> [but how that can be without enough to be
  buried in water and raised again, what ere he thinks I know no:] <hi>but if you
  vvill,</hi> saith he, <hi>presse hence a necessity of Resemblance of Christs
  death, buriall and resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our descending into, abiding in, and comming
  up out of the water, take heed least you be of those that adde to Gods word;
  least he reprove you as a lyar, and adde unto you the plagues written in his
  book, for I know not any Word of God, wherein this representation is
  necessarily implyed, much lesse expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:42067:175"/> Thus whereas he saies elsewhere, as I
  have shewed above, that the end of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism was to represent the spiriual grace
  as well as signify it, and that the spiritual grace, or thing signified, and to
  be cleerly represented is mortification and vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or communion with
  Christs death and resurrection (which things tis strange he should say against
  the word of God, for he protests it to be against the word when we say it, and
  if there be any word expressing or implying a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, which himself so
  much talks on, I am sure there is none like those two which we produce,
  <hi>viz. Rom. 6. Cot.</hi> 2. which most lively shew it, as I shall shew anon,
  and undeniably declare) yet here in the passage last cited, he that talks of
  this representation, and resemblance of Christs death and resurrection, and
  ours with him, as needful to be made in baptism, is a lyar with him and an
  adder to the word, which warrants no where to presse a resemblance of the thing
  signified in the dispensation of the outward sign, no not so much as in those
  Scriprures <hi>Rom 6. Col.</hi> 2. So this representation in baptism is with
  him it seems a matter that must be, and yet must not be, and yet must be.</p>
               <p>And yet for all this (which is the wonder of me, and will be of
  many more, but specially of every wise man, that hath his wits about him, and
  would have bin of Mr <hi>Woodcock</hi> too, who without taking notice of any
  weaknesse in it, extoll'd the Book in the beginning of it, and put it forth to
  Sir <hi>Iohn Burgoines</hi> patronage, had he well weighed these passages of
  it) Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> wheeles about once again, and will needes have a
  representation and resemblance of the thing signified by baptism in the manner
  of administration of it, and argues stiffely for it to, but the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
  must be of what he pleases among the things signified, and not of the main
  thing signifyed in baptism, it must be of sanctification as tis called a
  washing a cleansing, a purging, a pouring of the spirit on us, a sprinkling of
  the blood of Christ on us, and so be done by sprinkling water: but not as it
  stands divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its two parts mortification and vivification, a death and
  resurrection: or else if there must be a resemblance of this death and
  resurrection in baptism, then by an <hi>As for example</hi> fetcht from the old
  world, that was drowned, dead, buried by an infusion of water, not an
  immersion, and from the Ark which was rained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only, and not overwhelmed,
  this death and resurrection must needs, and may better be resembled by an
  infusion and sprinkling then by total immersion or dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in water, for if we
  urge to have the death and resurrection resembled by dipping, i. e. a
  descension into the water, and ascention out of the water, which we all know
  was the way of Christs and the Eunuchs baptism, we must urge also burial, which
  is principally expressed. <hi>Rom. 6. Col.</hi> 2. to be resembled too by
  biding of the whole man under the water for some time, answerable to Christs
  three daies biding in the bowels of the Earth, which cannot be without danger,
  quoth he, yea certainty of drowning: and if sprinkling should not so fitly
  resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as dipping and plunging, yet the Scripture no where requires the
  washing of the whole body, to all which I answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> 1. which thing of his called sprinkling of water
  on the face, for all he saies it may as well or better (sith so many were of
  old killed and buried by sprinkling, or raining on them in the daies of
  <hi>Noah)</hi> serve to resemble our death, and burial then dipping does, yet
  in truth resembles a death, burial, and resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, little more then a knock
  o'th' pate.</p>
               <p>Secondly, which drowning of the old world, as it would make not
  a jot for such a purpose as he pleads for, had it been by such a way as he
  dreames it was by <hi>viz.</hi> sprinkling, raining on them, by
  <hi>infusion</hi> and not <hi>immersion,</hi> yet in very deed (and so heel
  see, when he is awake, and his eyes are open) was by <hi>immersion</hi>
  immediately, and not <hi>infusion,</hi> for it might have rained long enough
  upon the earth, before the men that had houses to shelter themselves in from
  that, would have bin killed, and buried under water, if the waters had not
  prevailed by a flood so high over the earth, as to <hi>overwhelm</hi> the men
  under it, and plunge <pb n="342" facs="tcp:42067:176"/> them ore head and ears: and if he
  call that <hi>sprinkling</hi> and <hi>infusion,</hi> let him <hi>sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle</hi>
  or <hi>infuse</hi> water in such abundance, till the water sprinkled or
  infused, become of such depth about the parties he is about to sprinkle, as to
  swell ore their heads, and to swill them wholly under it, and I shall own such
  infusion for right baptism, yet none of Christs ordinance neither, unlesse
  dispenst to a right subject i. e. babes or beginners in the faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, which elegant allusion of his to the ark, as that on
  which water was onely powred or sprinkled, whence he seemes to argue thus
  <hi>viz.</hi> that it rained onely on the Ark, or water was onely powred or
  sprinkled upon the Ark, which Ark was a type of baptism,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> baptism must be dispenst by sprinkling, is as
  simple a delusion as ever was devised, for if he intend that for an argument to
  prove that baptism is to be done by sprinkling (and if not what does it there?)
  it does rather conclude that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism must be sprinkled as the Ark was, for
  reduce his matter into the form of a syllogism, and see how sillily it
  concludes <hi>viz.</hi> thus</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Ark was a Type of baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Ark was only sprinkled with the rain, not
  dipt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo, baptism its antitype, is to be dispenst by
  sprinkling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He concludes more then he can possibly squeeze out from those
  premises, and another thing then what is asserted of the Ark in his
  <hi>minor:</hi> whereas in right form it should run thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Ark typified baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Ark was rained on, baptized or wetted by infusion
  onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo baptism must be rained on, baptized or wetted by
  infusion onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then what simple stuff were this? what a logical lump of
  artificial non-sense?</p>
               <p>Besides, if it would follow that because the Ark which was a
  type of baptism was sprinkled, therefore the way of baptism is sprinkling, it
  would more truly follow that because the Ark was half dipt and half sprinkled,
  one part of it being under the water, another sprinkled with rain aboue the
  water, therefore the way of baptism is to dip one half of the person, and to
  sprinkle the other half: but alas the Ark was a type of baptism, as twas the
  way and outward meanes of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not in this respect as it was rained
  on: <hi>nullum simile currit Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, which washings, purgings, sprinklings of Christs
  blood, and clean water typified of old, and foreshadowed by the blood of calves
  and goats, with water and scarlet wool, and hysop, wherewith <hi>Moses</hi> and
  the high priests after him sprinkled the old <hi>Israel,</hi> so that they were
  typically and ceremonially count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed holy, and clean thereupon in a fleshly
  sense onely, are all expressions spoken not with such allusion to baptism (as
  Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> imagines) nor are so neer a kin to it as he laies claim to:
  for if they are all to be resembled and respected by us in our baptism, as
  things some way or other signified to us therein, yet are they not at all the
  main, or principall things, or such as are immediately, or prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, but
  onely remotely, and secondarily signified to us therein, and so not
  ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to be either all, or at all so much resembled as something else:
  But the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, which is the rise and root,
  the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and meritorious cause of all the rest, being that which (though
  you would shut it out altogether from its interest and right of being
  represented in baptism of all the rest) is mainly and most immediately
  signified, and primarily to be eyed, and respected. and all the rest but
  consequently, and through that, therefore its necessary that this should be
  resembled most lively, that it may take the deeper impression upon us.</p>
               <p>Yea these matters of Christs death, burial, and resurrection are
  such <hi>cardinall</hi> things to be considered, as <hi>quibus non
  mediantibus,</hi> without the mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <pb n="343" facs="tcp:42067:176"/> of which we
  cannot conceive clearly, nor lay claim to any of the other as ours.</p>
               <p>For as in the supper remotely heaven it self, and all spirituall
  excellencies are signified to us to be ours, yet all the things signified
  cannot be represented to the eye, but onely such as are the more immediate
  significations of it, and are the rise and proper cause of all the rest,
  <hi>viz.</hi> Christ crucified, and our feeding on him by faith, theseare, and
  are to be lively set forth unto us, and resembled before our eyes in bread and
  wine broken, and powred out and received and applied to us, but not all the
  fruits of his death and our faith. even so it is likewise in baptism; and
  indeed the main signification in both is <hi>Christs</hi> person crucified,
  dead, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and raised, and that is to be resembled in both, and other
  things <hi>viz.</hi> the benefits of his death as remission of sins, and
  purging, &amp;c. to be consequentially gathered from that, neither can, nor
  are, nor need all those to be resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:</p>
               <p>But as for Mr. <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>k</hi> he pleads stifly to have all these resembled <hi>viz.</hi>
  washing, purging, powring, sprinkling of the spirit and blood of Christ, but
  excludes the main thing altogether <hi>viz.</hi> Christs death and
  resurrection, which are the very rise and ground of all those: And yet if he
  will needs have all those to be resembled, are they not as much, and much more
  resembled by dipping and plunging a person in water, then by powring and
  sprinkling a little water upon him? and is not swilling under water a more
  effectuall way of washing and clensing then sprinkling? which though it be a
  <hi>Diminutive</hi> way of wetting, yet in truth is no way of wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all:
  If therefore he will have washing, and such a washing as well deserves the name
  of clensing to be resembled in baptism, can he have even that done in a better
  way then by dipping, or dousing? for verily plunging, is a washing, and a more
  eminent way of washing, and purifying, and so more lively resembling
  <hi>ablutione<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> peccatorum</hi> the
  purging away our sinnes by the blood of Christ, then aspersion, or bare
  infusion, either of which without some after rubbing is a way of washing and
  clensing seldome used by men or women, unlesse it be among slat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes that are
  minded to leave things as foul well nigh as they find them: and I am sure
  theres no rubbing succedaneous to your sprinkling, which is any ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to
  your dispensation, for what the priest drops on the midwife rubs indeed, not
  <hi>on,</hi> but <hi>off,</hi> and so as that is no washing, so (if it were) I
  hope you do not allow the midwife to give equal influence with the priest unto
  the dispensation of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
               <p>Besides, both sprinkling and powring are vertualy implied in
  plunging, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in water, but these are not at all supposed in the
  other, every lesser wetting being contained, and included in the greater, not
  so the greater in the lesse.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, which quirk of his concerning a necessity of abiding 3.
  daies under water answerable to Christs 3 daies buriall, if we will needs urge
  an necessity of resembling him in his death, burial and resurrection, is so
  fond, that a fool may find enough wherewith to refel it, for <hi>Mr. Cook</hi>
  knows that <hi>nullum simile cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit quatuor,</hi> no similitude answers in all
  things, besides tis the truth and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the thing, not the
  circumstance, or quantity of time of abode, which is to be respected here, for
  a burial is as true a burial, when a person abides but 3. minutes wholly under
  the element, wherein he is buried, as if he abode 3. daies, and a burial is as
  truly represented by being once under water, as if one continued under
  altogether, and the resurrection a little better by being brought up again
  alive, then if one lay till he were altogether dead.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and lastly, which assertion of his, uttered in favour of
  his assertion <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scripture no where requires the washing of
  the whole body, is so much the more favouring of either ignorance, or
  forgetfulnesse in him, or both, by how much one of the very Scriptures, that
  are quoted by himself, as speaking in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <pb n="344" facs="tcp:42067:177"/> to
  baptism, doth require it, for its said <hi>Heb. 10. 22. let us draw neer with a
  true heart &amp;c. and having our bodies washed with pure water,</hi> which
  clause (if meant of baptism as undoubtedly it is) requires not a sprinkling,
  but a wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (and thats more then your sprinkling is) and this too not of the
  face only, which is the only part you sprinkle, but of our bodies; which word
  whether we shall take properly to signifie the whole body indeed, or run to
  figurative acceptations, when we need not, and take the body by a
  <hi>Synechdoche</hi> of the whole for a part to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie so small a part as
  the face only, I need not wish a wise man to determine, for every unprejudiced
  man that hath but common sense will see cause enough to take it plainly as it
  lies.</p>

  as you not must, before I believe or receive it, that it is so needful as you
  would make it that there should be a resemblance of the thing signified in that

               <p>Having thus blown away the strange mist, whereby Mr.

  clearly the true intent of those Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures <hi>Rom. 6. Col.</hi> 2. nor the
  truth at all in this point of total dipping, I come now in answer to his and
  your, and Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> flat denial of any word or warrant for any
  representation, and also to his demand p. 27. to shew how we gather from
  reason, and your own authors, and those very Sciptures you oppose, the dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
  of the whole man over the head, and under the water, and that a similitude of
  Christs death, burial and rising again to be represented by dipping into the

               <p>But first I must tell you I observe you know not greatly what to
  say among you against our urgings of a resemblance of Christs death, and
  burial, and resurrection from these Scriptures: for some of you stand it out,
  as much as you well can, that there is not to be any representation of a death
  and resurrection, as Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> both do, the
  Dr. keeping at such a distance from it, that to fence it farr enough from him
  he denies any such thing to be so much as signified, Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> yielding
  that that very thing among others is signified, and that the spiritual grace or
  thing signified is to be represented too, only you must excuse him as to that
  piece of the spiritual grace, all the rest but that he will give way to have
  resembled, but fearing least it can hardly be so cleerly evaded, but that twil
  needs be proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them that a death, burial and resurrection must be
  represented, they fall a proving it that there may be, and is a death burial
  and resurrection reselmbled in their way of sprinkling, and infusion, as much
  (if not more then in our way of dipping) but either of them shift for
  themselves in severall wayes, the Drs way wherein he proves there is a
  resemblance of death and resurrection in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of baptism, as it is
  administred in the Church of <hi>England</hi> is this, <hi>though the child be
  not dipped in water himself</hi> (saith he) <hi>yet the minister dippeth his
  hand in water und plucketh it out again when he baptizeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi>
  where note, that the Doctor doth conceive that though sprinkling may serve to
  represent a death and resurrection, as well as our dipping, yet it is upon this
  absurd account <hi>viz.</hi> in that there is a certain dipping accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
  their sprinkling, whereby that resemblance is made <hi>viz.</hi> the divping
  the hand of the Administrator: but Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> though he be not so gross
  as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with the Dr. that the burying of the ministers hand will serve
  instead <pb n="345" facs="tcp:42067:177"/> of burying the persons body, which is, if any
  burial be at all, to be buried in baptism, yet he is as grosse in his
  conception another way, while he goes about to prove sprinkling, or infusion it
  self to resemble a death burial and resurrection as sufficiently as dipping,
  and this too by such a coined <hi>Chymaera,</hi> such a crude and im mature
  imagination as is ridiculous, <hi>viz.</hi> of the old worlds being drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
  and buried by no more then sprinkling, and the fall of rain, for verily neither
  was the rain a resemblance of a death, burial and resurrection, or any thing
  like thereto: nor yet was it the rain but the overflowing of waters by reason
  of the rain that drowned them, and though that orewhelming was a lively emblem
  of death and burial, as baptism is to be, yet there was nothing that resembled
  a resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as in baptisme there must be, sith they never rose from under
  it any more.</p>
               <p>This crooked come off therefore of Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> is farre
  more ridiculous then ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and yet I know more men of his mind in this
  particular, I mean so far as to agree to it, with lesse ado then he doth, that
  a death, burial and resurrection is to be resembled in baptism, and yet to
  think that the sprinkling or casting water upon the party doth sufficiently
  make that resemblance, but I testify to him that this his way is his foily, and
  theirs also that apptove his sayings, and I advise both him and them that
  adhere to him to be heartily ashamed of two opinions of his, so equally odd and
  absurd that I can scarce tell well which of thetwo are more absurd then the
  other.</p>
               <p>The one is his supposition that the spiritual grace to be
  represented and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the manner of administration of that ordinance of
  baptism is sprinkling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprinkling with the blood of Christ, whence in order
  thereto he as unworthily argues, that baptism must be dispensed by sprinkling,
  which indeed nullifies it from being baptism, if he consider the inconsistency
  that is proved to be between them.</p>
               <p>The other is the thing in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> his supposition
  that sprinkling may well not only signify, but resemble a death, burial and
  resurrection as well as dipping, and is as well required, for so he hints p.
  19. to be used in this Sacrament as the other.</p>
               <p>If those, who own these things, and whose own they are, will not
  be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them, for my part I am, for to think that the wisdome of the
  spirit, that in condescension to our dull capacities did leave visible signs to
  be not only true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances, but also lively resemblances of spiritual
  things, should order things so unsuitably to sense, as to require and appoint
  maters utterly unlike one another, and between which there is no
  <hi>Analogy</hi> at all to answer one the other by way of resemblance,
  <hi>viz.</hi> such a thing as ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>sm to resemble a death, burial and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which are to be,
  and are truly resembled all in true baptism, i. e. in dipping, or appoint such
  an ordinance as baptism, which in plain English is dipping, to resemble rantism
  only, or sprinkling with Christs blood is no lesse the absurdity in the
  abstract.</p>
               <p>But as for you your self, you are it seems of Mr.
  <hi>Blakes</hi> mind, i. e. resolved to own no necessity at all of any
  resemblance of any thing, not of any ceremony to be in the sign of baptism,
  representing the things signifyed in it, I shall therefore shew that as in true

  of the death and resurrection of Christ, and of ours with him in that
  ordinance: whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you say that all signes do not represent the
  thing signified thereby, tis true who questions that? but twill not therefore
  follow, but that there are some signs that both do, and may and by institution
  must not only signify, but also resemble at least the main things that are
  signified, of which sort baptism is without question one.</p>
               <p>We must here thefore distinguish concerning signes, among which
  some are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, <pb n="346" facs="tcp:42067:178"/> which by nature signify the things,
  whereof they are signs, as smoak signifies that there is fire, as we say there

               <p>Others <hi>Praeter-natural</hi> and institutive, which by

  humane appointment, as the Ivy-bush is a sign among men that wine is to be
  sold, where it hangs; or divine, as the <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow</hi> is a sign by divine
  appointment to signify that the world shall never be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drowned again by

  <hi>simpliciter signantia,</hi> meerly and simply significative of the things
  they sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie without any <hi>Analogy,</hi> or likenesse to them at all, as
  the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> which signifies, but resembles not the worlds deliverance
  from drowning, and the dew, and drought that were by turnes on <hi>Gideons</hi>
  fleece, which were signes to him of it, but not resemblances of his victory,
  and the shadowes going back upon the dial of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> which was a sign to

  viz. the sacraments, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those of the old, or those of the New Testament,
  <hi>viz.</hi> Circumcision, and the Passeover, baptism and the Supper, from the
  manner of the administration of the two first of which you use to argue to the
  manner of the administration of the two last, which so far, but no further then
  serves your turnes you say came in the room of the other; for though by way of
  <hi>Analagy</hi> with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, as comming in the room thereof, you would
  have baptisme dispensed to infants, yet neither <hi>Anallogically</hi> to males
  onely, nor on the 8th day onely, nor to male servants also, nor yet by way of
  analogy with the <hi>pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> which admitted of every circumcisied soul,
  will you admit baptized infants to the supper, which came by institution more
  truly, and immediately in the room of the <hi>Passeover,</hi> even when it was
  <hi>moriturum,</hi> if not <hi>plane mortuum?</hi> for it was no more to be
  meddied with for ever, whereas circumcision was in use <hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> after
  baptism was begun,</p>
               <p>But I pray Sirs be not pickers and chusers thus at your own
  pleasure, but if you will have an analogy to be held, let it be in such things,
  wherein it should be held between the old testament sacraments and the new.</p>
               <p>An argument however <hi>ad hominem</hi> i. e. sufficient to
  confute you out of your own mouthes, who plead so for analogy between those two
  administrations of the old testament, and these two of the new arises naturally
  from your own opinions, for if a proportion must needs be kept between
  circumcision and baptism in point of administration otherwise, why not in the
  manner of the administration of these signes, as they stand in reference to the
  things thereby signified, so as that the one of these signes <hi>viz.</hi>
  baptism, may stand in some proportion to its <hi>signatum,</hi> as well as the
  other i. e. circumcision?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pascal lamb</hi> without blemish, a bone of which was
  not to be broken, did not onely signifie, but lively resemble also <hi>Agnum
  immaculatum exhibendum,</hi> that lamb Christ Iesus, which was once to be
  offered without spot to God, and not a bone of him to be broken, also the
  supper that came after it doth not onely signifie, but resemble also <hi>Agnum
  exhibitum,</hi> Christ crucified, that immaculate lamb now offered, whose body
  was broken and blood shed, by bread broken and wine powred forth.</p>
               <p>Circumcision or cutting off the superfluous foreskin of the
  flesh did not only signify, but lively represent the <hi>signatum,</hi> the
  Circumcision of the heart, <hi>i. e.</hi> sanctification, the paring off, and
  putting away the fleshly superfluities of the heart, and can you give us think
  you, or give your selves either any good account, why baptism onely of all the
  rest should be exempted in this case, from bearing <pb n="347" facs="tcp:42067:178"/> with
  the rest an <hi>Analogy,</hi> proportion and similitude to its
  <hi>signatum,</hi> i. e. the thing mainly notifyed therein? which originally is
  the death, burial and resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ, and our communion therewith, and
  plantation into the likenesse thereof: is not the manner of administration of
  that to be such also, as may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble (and so onely the way of dipping doth) a
  Death, Buriall, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection?</p>
               <p>Rouse up and reckon but with your consciences a little, and see

  and do with him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the words <hi>baptized in his death, buried with him
  in baptism into death, wherein yee are also risen with him</hi> &amp;c. not of
  the things signified only, <hi>viz.</hi> our Mortification of sin and rising to
  holinesse in a way of likeness to Christs death and resurrection, but also of
  the outward right and form of administration of the sign it self, to be done in
  a way of likenesse to them both, so that we by that (as by an image or lively
  resemblance) may not only be kept in a lively remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the matter of
  them, but may beat the manner of those matters also in our minds.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Calvin l. 4. c. 15. s. 5. Alterum sructum affert
  baptisnius qui nostram in Christo Mortificationem ostendit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>id
  est, another fruit of baptism is this, it sets forth our death to sin in Christ
  and our new life in him, fitly, as the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel saith</hi> Rom. 6. 3. <hi>we
  are baptized into his death, and buried with him in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism into death that we
  might walk in a new life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which words he doth exhort us to an imitation of him, as if
  he should say we are admonished by baptism, that by a resemblance of Christs
  death, we should dy to our lusts, and by the example of his resurrection, we
  should rise to righteousness &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Also l. 4. c. 16. s. 16. speaking against such as say (no more
  then truth though) <hi>Baptismum esse sepulturam, in quam nulli nisi jam mortui
  tradendi sunt,</hi> id est, <hi>That Baptism is a form or way of burial with
  which none, but such as are i. e. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be already dead to sin, or to have
  repented from their dead works are to be buried.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that he might vindicate infants who yet in infancy cannot dy
  to sin, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent from dead works, tells us (but believe him who will in
  that.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nos jam ante Mortuos per baptismum sepeliri,</hi> id est,
  <hi>That persons are to be buried in baptism, before they be dead, before they
  repent, or appear to have died to sin,</hi> and to prove that, he cotes this
  very place <hi>Rom</hi> 6. 4. which the scripture (saith he) <hi>Deserte
  reclamet, nos ea conditione in mortem sepeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, ut emoriamur ac
  mortificationem istam exinde meditemur, i. e.</hi> very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly proclaims
  the contrary, namely, that <hi>we are buried in baptism in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, on this
  very condition, that we may die to sin, and may even by <pb n="350" facs="tcp:42067:180"/>
  that outward visible burial we have in baptism be minded of the duty of
  morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Exposition is the truth, yet not the whole truth, nor yet
  so much as serves the turn Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> brings it for: tis true we are
  baptized into death, or buried in baptism in token that we must, and on this
  condition that we shall dy to sin, yet not only so, but also in token, and on
  condition that we are dead in a measure, or have repented already; nor doth it
  follow because we are buried in baptism, that we may, and in token that we must
  die more, and more to sin, that therefore we are to be buried in baptism before
  we die to sin, for we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent before baptism and after it also.</p>
               <p>But however the truth that is in it is enough to serve our turn
  at present, i. e. to prove his Judgement and ours to jump together, as to the
  true intent and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those phrases in the text, viz. <hi>buried with him
  in baptism into death,</hi> which both hee and we take to expresse the outward
  ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e of baptism, and that that
  outward rite be performed answerably to the name here given it in manner and
  form of a burial, which cannot be without submersion, and this too in token,
  and as a resemblance of our death to sin and burial with Christ, the
  <hi>signatum</hi> or thing signifyed and resembled, which whether it go before
  or come with or after the sign is not material.</p>
               <p>And though Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> and we are twain and cannot agree
  whether we are to be baptized, i. e. buried in baptism before we are dead to
  sin or after, yet herein we meet in one with all other Expositors on this place
  so far as I find (Mr <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> only excepted) viz.
  that whether <hi>Mortui</hi> or <hi>Morituri</hi> we ought to be buried in
  baptism according to this place, not spiritually only, for that is the inward
  thing signifyed into which, i. e in token and resemblance of which we are
  outwardly buried, but visibly and representatively also in the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>Much what to the same purpose speaks <hi>Calvin</hi> again about
  three or four pages after, 'where coting both the places we are now in hand
  with, <hi>viz. Romans 6. 4. Col.</hi> 2. 12. He Expounds the words <hi>buried
  with Christ in baptism</hi> of the verity of the outward rite it self,
  representing and betokening the spiritual death to sinne that ought to follow
  it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paraeus</hi> also upon <hi>Vrsin</hi> p. 375. speaking how
  baptism is a token not only of remission of sin, but regeneration also, which
  he makes so synonimous with our death and burial with Christ that he cotes
  these these two places <hi>Rom. 6. 4, Col.</hi> 2. 12. to prove regeneration to
  be signifyed in it, (for <hi>we are said</hi> (saith he) <hi>to dy and to be
  buryed with Christ in baptism)</hi> gives this as one reason why we are said to
  be regenerated that is, in his sence, dead and buried with Christ in baptism,
  because of the likenesse that is between baptism and those things: so that he
  al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so takes the phrase <hi>buried with Christ</hi> in that place to sound forth
  <hi>Sepelitionem externam internae simulacrum,</hi> that external act of being
  buried in water by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, that is the lively embleme of the internal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zanchy</hi> also upon Col. 2. 12. writes thus viz.
  <hi>Regenerationis duae sunt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of Regeneration there are
  two parts Mortification and vivisication, that is called burial with Christ,
  this resurrection with Christ, the sacrament of both these is baptism, in which
  we are overwhelmed or buried, and after that do come forth and rise again; it
  may be said truly but sacramentally of all that are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed that they are
  buried with Christ and raised with him, yet really only of such as have true
  faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I appeal to all men whether he do not here expound
  <hi>Paul</hi> in the words <hi>buried with him in baptism and therein risen
  with him</hi> as speaking of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rite of baptism whereby the spiritual
  death and resurrection is resembled, yea and so lively resembled that even such
  as have no more then the bare outward sign of water in baptism without the
  thing signifyed may be said, though <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,</hi> 
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:42067:180"/> i. e. and <hi>analogically</hi> and in respect of neer

  and <hi>vivisication</hi> they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated buried and raised with
  Christ, yet that outward rite and ceremony cannot of it self denominate them so
  much as Sacramentally buried and raised with Christ, for there is not so much
  as any likenesse of such things in it, but he that hath the true outward rite
  of baptism, i. e. dipping dispensed to him may be truly said to be buried and
  raised with Christ, though he have no more, for he hath the same visible
  overwhelming, and burying in water and raising again in baptism, which in the
  bare ordinance of baptism Christ himself had.</p>

 of the external and earthly, which are the signes, with the heavenly things, or

 them, is the cause why both the names, and the properties of the signes and
 things signifyed are frequently given to one another by a familiar me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonimy of
 the holy Scriptures, wherein baptism is called the washing of
 regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</q> and is said to save us, saith he, and in this respect also
  (say I) we are said to be buryed and raised in baptism in those places, because
  of that lively resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of and likenesse to a burial and resurrection that
  ought by institution to be in the dispensation of baptism, and that is in that

  <hi>Essigies</hi> of all that was done to him in his baptism dwelling indelably

  indeed? and yet behold I believe I may be so bold as to guesse by what he saies

  those words of <hi>Paul Act.</hi> the 17. 28. viz. <hi>as certain of your own
  poets have said,</hi> was <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi> an argument of more weight, then

  necessity of resemblance of burial and resurrection to be made in baptism by
  immersion, submersion, emersion, be not considered, the never so well grounded
  Testimony of my single silly self must needs be sleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse whether you will hear, or whether you will forbear
  I shall leave a word or two upon record, whereby either to inlighten you, that
  there is a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance <pb n="355" facs="tcp:42067:182"/> of a burial and resurrection
  necessarily to be held forth in baptism, and that no lesse is necessarily
  implyed at least in these two places, <hi>Romans</hi> 6. and <hi>Coloss.</hi>
  2. or else to leave you without excuse in your disownings of it: For</p>
               <p>First, this will appear plainly; if it be considered that by the
  word baptized in the texts is undoubtedly meant the outward rite, ceremony,
  sign and form of the administration of baptism.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if it be considered that the phrase <hi>buried with
  him and risen with him,</hi> i. e. Christ, doth expressely relate immediately
  and specially (if not onely) in those texts to that outward sign it self, as
  that in which, taken distinctly from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery and inward grace. we are said
  to be buried and risen, not onely in significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but in lively
  representation of the inward and spritual burial and resurrection with Christ,
  and not to the spiritual, internal death and resurrection it self, as that
  which is to be understood by those phrases at all, muchlesse onely, or
  alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or abstractively, and apart from any outward and bodily burial and
  resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in baptism, as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> seeme
  too impishly to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this appears yet further insomuch as there are other
  phrases in that 6 of the <hi>Rom.</hi> that do intimate, and expresse that
  spirituall death and resurrection that is signified by the an alogical, and
  representative burial of the body in water, and raising it again in baptism
  <hi>viz. dead to sin, alive to God, newnesse of life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here is mention made of the things signified: And as for that
  that is spoken of und<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> this
  expression <hi>buried in baptism</hi> tis delievered as a <hi>medium</hi>
  whereby, as a motive whereupon, as a reason wherefore, as an image and
  representative wherein we are both to read, and remember, and also to practise,
  and perform that other: for do but mark, <hi>how shall we</hi> (saith he)
  <hi>that are dead to sinne</hi> i. e. should be so, <hi>live any longer
  therein? know you not that as many of you as were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into Christ</hi> i.
  e. into or in token of an interest in him of a onenesse, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with
  him by faith, <hi>are baptized into his death,</hi> i. e. in token of such a
  communion with the power of his death, as kills sin, and crucifies the old man,
  <hi>So that henceforth we should not serve sin? therefore,</hi> or hence it is,
  saith he, that <hi>in baptism</hi> i. e. the outward ordinance, <hi>we are
  buried with him</hi> i. e. outwardly, visibly bodily in water <hi>into
  death</hi> i. e. in token and resemblance of our dying to sin by vertue of his
  death, that we should be ever practically mindful of this, <hi>that like as
  Christ rose again</hi> after he was dead, <hi>so we should rise to a new life:
  for if we have bin planted together in the likenesse of his death</hi> i. e.
  signally in outward baptism, spiritually, and really in the inward work, and
  washing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the spirit upon the soul, <hi>we shall be also in the
  likenesse of his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> i. e. we should be <hi>de jure,</hi> and
  shall <hi>de facto</hi> as we believe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this burial and resurrection that is immediately
  expressed by the words <hi>buried with him in baptism wherein you are also
  risen with him,</hi> is made a motive, argument, and incitement to the
  spiritual death, and resurrection, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we perswaded to die to
  sin, and live righteously, because in baptism we are buried in water; and
  raised again in token that we ought so to do, and on this cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>on are we baptized and buried and
  raised therein, and so interessed into all the other benefits of Christs death,
  remission of sins and salvation <hi>viz.</hi> that we should die to sin, and
  live holily; and to this end also that we may be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereby to do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nos ea conditione in mortem sepeliri in baptismo Scriptura

               <p>Now if this death and burial, that we are buried with in
  baptism, be to this end to teach us, and shew us that, and how we must die to
  sin, then the buriall <pb n="356" facs="tcp:42067:183"/> in baptism there spoken of is not
  the death to sin it self, for the motive and things we are moved to are two,
  and so are the sign and thing signified. now</p>
               <p>Fifthly tis not only such as is made a motive to the other,

  the outward man in a figure, or resemblance passes through both at, &amp; in

  them to die more to sin after it, yet you say your subjects for all that are
  buried in baptism too, and so say we of ours, therefore the burial in baptism
  there meant is no other then that of the sign, for the thing signified
  <hi>viz.</hi> the death to sin is not done in baptism, whether it be before or
  after it, and one of the two it is, for <hi>Calvin</hi> saies truly that we
  hold <hi>baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum esse sepulturam in quam nulli nisi jam mortui</hi> already
  dead i. e. dying to sin are to be buried, but of himself and others that are
  baptized in infancy he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

  quoting <hi>Rom.</hi> the 6. 4. <hi>nos jam ante mortuos per baptismum
  sepeliri</hi> i. e. before we are dead to sin, we are buried by baptism l. 4.
  c. 16. S. 16. the burial therefore is not the <hi>signatum,</hi> but the
  <hi>signum</hi> i. e. their putting under water in baptism, which
  <hi>sacramentally</hi> is called a burial, even therefore because of the
  analogy and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it bears to such a thing, even to Christs burial, and
  ours with him, which are the things analogized and lively resembled thereby i.
  e. by immersion, for by aspersion they are not.</p>
               <p>And so I have proved by three arguments hitherto that Christs
  ordinance of baptism is a totall dipping <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First by the prime signification of the word baptize which is to
  overwhelm or wash by swilling, or dipping, but never to sprinkle, as Rantize
  never to dipp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> wash.</p>
               <p>Secondly by the practise of the primitive times, which was
  totally to dip, as I have made appear many wayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly by the name of a burial and resurrection, thats there
  given to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sign by a sacramental <hi>Metonimy</hi> i. e. in this
  respect as in its dispensation it must bear analogy and likenesse, as
  spirinkling does not, to the death burial and resurrection of Christ, and ours
  in him, which are the things immediatly signified in baptism, and therefore
  mainly, and as lively as may be to exemplified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. If there be yet any
  more to say against dipping, and for sprinkling, let us hear it, and as I find
  it true upon triall, or false and feigned, so accordingly I shall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t er
  answer it, or yield, for I know that he, who is not as desirous to hear all
  that can be said against what he holds, as what is to be said for it can never
  be so solidly settled in it as he should be: for <hi>nil tam certum quam quod
  ex dubio certum est,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing more sure to a man then that which he sees as well on
  what ground some doubt and disown it, as one what himself owns and imbraces it,
  and though I professe my self to be beyond all doubt that Rantism is no
  ordinance of Christ, but a meer figment of men meaning to serve Christ by the
  halves, nor infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism neither, (howbeit I have disputed for them both,
  and thought I did God ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <pb n="357" facs="tcp:42067:183"/> in it too) yet he that
  knoweth my heart, knoweth that I have so unsatiable a thirst after the
  knowledge of truth, that if I could think those things to be the truth of God,
  as I once did, upon the same rotten, and reasonlesse principles you now think
  so on, I should re-entertain them with rejoicing in my flesh, which would find
  much ease, and honour by it, and in the spirit much more, which would have that
  ease, and honour, with peace of conscience, which I was once constrained to
  deny my self of, because it was once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent in me with such peace, but
  welcome that disgraced truth of dipping dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, sith tis that truth, which
  I am certain (howbeit they have trampled it for a time) the gates of hell shall
  never prevail against, nor the ablest man on earth so as to disprove it by all
  that is to be said to the contrary from the word of Christ.</p>

  way of exception against much of that you have alleadged about the
  childishnesse, vanity, and insufficiency of infants sprinkling, but also
  against that dipping fancy you are fallen into, which is some new motion, or
  renewed notion at the best, having</hi> (for all you have said) <hi>neither
  good ground, nor example from the word, onely the old greek word may be so
  construed, and thats all the ground I could ever learn for that fluid practise,
  and I am confident that you and that party are wholly in the wrong, for I have
  seriously studied that controversie, and besought the Lord to guide me, and his
  good spirit by principles from his word of truth sealed upon my conscience doth
  assure me that way of dipping is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, irrational, and more uncivilly
  foolish, then infant baptism can be called childish, and I desire you to tell
  me what commission he had that baptized you, who may possibly be an unbaptized
  person, or if he was not yet if you look but some few removes backward, and
  inquire who baptized him? and who him? and who him? &amp;c. you must come at
  least to unbaptized persons, I mean even in your own account, who deny
  sprinkling to be baptism, and such I hope you do not count fit administrators
  of baptism, and yet such must begin it, for your way was not in use very long
  agon, also what commission hath Christ given you to baptize, you being no
  minister of the Gospel? and also what commission he hath given you or any else
  to baptize in that manner, which is without Scripture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst reason, and
  common sence and discretion? yea I may say against all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of modesty

               <p>I have been so much innured to such hot-shots since I owned the
  truth, that I can well walk in the middest of them now without amazemeut: much
  of this sort of matter I have under my hands in private letters to my self, and
  others, and what of it is not there is legible I confesse, as it were in text
  letters in the printed <hi>Polemicals</hi> of your <hi>Champions,</hi> whose
  sharp censures, and heavy charges of the way of truth, which we walk in, how
  judicious they are shall (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) be anon examined, sith you send us to
  them: at present you shall have a short word to your quaeries, and such other
  passages which may occure, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene either from your self, or their
  writings in way of contradiction or obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to any thing that hath been
  said before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:42067:184"/> Your first is grounded upon a simple
  supposition, that an unbaptized person may in no case baptize, or make a fit
  administrator of baptism, whereas there is nothing in the world more clear then
  this, that when it is to be done, and cannot be well done otherwise it may be
  done (as well as by one that was) by one that never was baptized at all: yea
  why not in case of innitiation after intermission as well as at the innitiation
  of the Gospel it self? I wonder who baptized <hi>Iohn</hi> the
  <hi>Baptist,</hi> that was the greatest administrator that ever was? for either
  he was baptized surely, or else he was not, if he was ever baptized at all, who
  baptized him? but if he was never baptized the matter amounts still to be the
  same, i. e. to evince no lesse then we assert that at the innitiation of the
  dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether at first, or after a long unlawful cessation, an
  unbaptized person may baptize: for if <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi>
  himself was not baptized himself, or if he was, either by one that was
  unbaptized, or else by one that was first baptized by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he talks in his
  sleep that saies an unbaptized person may not in such a pressing case
  baptize.</p>
               <p>Your second querie is as unsolidly grounded as the other, and
  supposes your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to be this, that no man, though baptized himself,
  unlesse he be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, i. e. an ordained officer may baptize, for say you
  what commission have you to baptize you being no Minister of the Gospel?
  whereas if by Minister you mean one officiating as a pastor over a people,
  there is nothing more cleer in the world or in the word either, then that
  others besides the Ministers may baptize, viz. not any <hi>she,</hi> for which
  theres no president, but rather precept to the contrary 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 2
  <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. but any prophet i. e. any <hi>he</hi> gifted disciple,
  especially who by the improvement of his gifts he proves, as not seldome such
  do, instrumentall of the parties convertion: <hi>Ananias</hi> baptized
  <hi>Paul</hi> himself, yet was he but a certain disciple <hi>Acts</hi> the 9.
  if you say that he was sent by God himself, to that service, it serves to shew
  this however, which we affirm that God limited not that dispensation to the
  Ministry, for if he had he would have sent <hi>Peter,</hi> or at least some
  other officer to that work.</p>
               <p>Did not <hi>Philip</hi> baptize the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and the
  Eunuch? yet he did it in the capacity of a disciple, and howbeit tis true he
  was ordained to be a <hi>Deacon,</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> were by the
  <hi>Bishops</hi> babishly authorized to baptize, yet that was no part of his
  office as a <hi>Deacon,</hi> for his <hi>Deaconship</hi> designed him to no
  more then barely to have a care of the poor, and if you say he was an
  <hi>Evangelist</hi> also, so is every one that is gifted to preach the Gospel,
  and doth it, whether he be in any office or no, for <hi>Evangelist</hi> is
  nothing but a preacher of the Gospel, and such are they that occasionally
  preach it, as well as such as preach it constantly by way of office: therefore

  these occasionally only, and not as by vertue of an ordination to an office,
  may say it ten times over, before the Scripture, rightly understood, will

               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:42067:184"/> And as these ordinary disciples, for the
  Apostles abode still at <hi>Ierusalem Act.</hi> 8. 1. went every where as well
  as <hi>Philip, pro suo modulo Evangelizantes</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Christ according
  to their abilities, so the hand of the Lord was with those occasional
  preachers, that a great number believed, and turned to the Lord by their means,
  and were baptized also undoubtedly by their hands; yea the famous Church of
  <hi>Ant ioch</hi> had its foundation from this, and grew into a Church, which
  they could not do without baptism, before any actual officer came neer them:
  for though <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> walked with them for a year and
  improved their gifts for their edification, yet neither of these, were yet
  actually any more then <hi>Evangelists,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> though
  before by God intended, and not long after by the Church visibly ordained to
  their Apostleship, i. e. men of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent gifts, and this will appear
  <hi>Act.</hi> 11. from verse 19. to the end, with <hi>Act.</hi> 13. v. 4. and
  backward to the beginning: you do therefore greatly err not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
  Scriptures, which tell you also plainly that though <hi>Paul</hi> converted all
  the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> yet his own hands baptized but a few, committing that
  dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, as an inferiour work to his preaching, to the hands of inferiour
  disciples, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself also confesses to your confutation,
  asserting it from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1 17. so though <hi>Peter</hi> converted the
  company in <hi>Cornelius</hi> house, yet surely he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized them not all, if
  any at all, with his own hands, but left the administration to the hands of
  others, some one or more of the brethren that came with him; And the manner of
  speech implies plainly no lesse, <hi>for he commanded that they should all be
  baptized in the name of the Lord:</hi> yea so far is the word from tying up the
  dispensation of baptism to an office, that we have much more president and
  proof after Christs ascension of comon disciples, then you have of officers
  baptizing.</p>
               <p>You therefore make much more a do in this then needs, you strain
  indeed at a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>at, and swallow a
  camel, and busy your self so about the truth of administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that you have
  lost the truth, and substance of the administration it self; were your baptism
  true baptism indeed, there is no necessity that ordained <hi>Ministers</hi>
  must administer it, but unlesse it were
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it is, no matter if it were

               <p>Know therefore Sirs I beseech you that the verity worth, weight
  and efficacy of baptism depends not upon the quality of the person
  administring, but upon the truth of the subject to whom, and the true form
  wherein tis administred; the Scripture prescribes plainly who they are that
  shall, and in what manner these shall, but not at all by whom they shall be
  baptized: tis the duty of them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>at
  believe to be baptized, and his duty that baptizes to baptize indeed, not
  rantize only, and to baptize such as, being taught the Gospel, do believe it,
  but who they must be that are to baptize those is neither here nor there to the
  baptism for ought I find in the word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, so they be but Masculine disciples: nay though the person
  baptizing be not only no officer (but in the case above named as yet)
  unbaptized himself, yet if the person baptized be not only a believing
  disciple, but also baptized really, and indeed his baptism is never the worse
  for the other:</p>
               <p>Experience tells me, and I believe many more, that have been
  baptized ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth, that twas drawing neer to Christ with true hearts
  in his true ordinance that made us accepted in his sight, not the
  qualifications of the baptizers, whose baptism and ministerial functions (were
  they invested with both) could add never the more validity nor verity to our
  baptism, as neither could the non-entity of either of those in them have
  possibly made the baptism so sincerely submitted to, be in any measure void,
  and of no effect; the placing so much in persons administring as to think our
  selves ere the better for that, was that fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical fopery of the
  <hi>Corinthians</hi> for a while, one saying <hi>I am of Paul, another I of
  Apollo, another I of Caep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>as</hi>
  i. e. I was baptized by such or such, which made the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who
  with his own hands baptized but some of them, well
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>igh wish he had baptized none of
  them at all, when he saw their carnall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <pb n="360" facs="tcp:42067:185"/> in the
  persons administring, and blesse God that he baptizd no more, least they should
  have thougt the better of themselves, and of their baptism for its
  dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of it by his hands.</p>
               <p>The administrators therefore being baptized or not baptized,
  minister or no minister maketh the baptism, if elsewise warrantable, neither
  better nor worse of it self: all this I speak all this while, not as granting
  that our baptism is by unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed persons, and that my self am no minister of
  the Gospel, for neither of these shall be yielded by any meanes, unlesse you
  were more able then you are to prove them, I speak it suppositively that if
  these were both so, yet both my baptizing and being baptized may be warrantable
  enough notwithstanding or else if we deemed it worth while to seek out what
  succession our baptism hath had from the Apostles, in a series without
  interruption, tis possible there were some disciples in all ages that owned the
  truth, though so few and despised, that their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can scarcely be
  declared, for who can declare his generation, whose life in himself, and his
  was still cut off from the earth? but we go by the word that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all
  Church and Ministry in our account of our baptism and ministry, and not by
  succession in either: and as for your selves, that hold so much on succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
  and boast of a lineal descent of your ministry and Rantism from the Apostles,
  twill pussle you no lesse to prove that, if we put you to it, then twill if we
  put you to it to disprove a lineal succession of our baptism, for if we cannot
  name the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons that baptized one another in this way, wherein we
  do it, successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the persons of the Apostles in answer to this
  question who baptized you? and who him? and who him? and so upwards till we
  come thither, are you able if we ask you who sprinkled you? and who him? and
  who him? and who him? &amp;c. to particularize more punctually then we? are you
  able to assign who began our way of baptism first of all in the world, unlesse
  you begin as high as <hi>Iohn</hi> the baptist? nay verily though Dr.
  <hi>Featley</hi> would fain father it upon <hi>Stock,</hi> yet its most
  manifest unto you all that infants sprinkling was denied by some ever since it
  was known to have a being, for it was controverted in the daies of the fathers,
  and that it would not have been had there been none that had then denied it,
  and deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it could not be by any but such as pleaded the baptism of
  believers, in those times, and were the right way baptized themselves.</p>
               <p>You have not one president of one infant sprinkled, nor proof
  that such a thing was so much as talked on, for at least an hundred years after
  Christ, but we are most certain, and your selves canno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> deny it, that the bapti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>m of believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at <hi>Iohn</hi> the baptist, and
  the Apostles, and if we could prove a succession of it <hi>de facto</hi> no
  further downwards then so, yet it is enough to us that we find it then was so,
  whereby to prove that it ought to have been so in all ages since, and is to be
  <hi>de jure</hi> at this day.</p>
               <p>One word more and then we have done with this, if none at all
  save such as are baptized themselves may in any case dispense baptism to
  others, save such also as are by ordination true ministers of the Gospel; then
  your selves, who pretend solely to the title of baptizing, are no right
  administrators, as being in truth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baptized, nor ordained in such wise
  as the Scripture requires: that your bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is null I have cleared it enough
  already, and that your ministry is no lesse is apparent, sith whilst you
  indeavour to derive it from the Apostles, you can derive it thence no other
  wise then the Pope doth his, for if a line of succession be a proof of true
  ministry, you may indeed derive it as well, but not one jot better then he, he
  can shew you his line of succession, if not from <hi>Peter,</hi> yet at least
  from <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> himself, that lived in the daies of the Apostles, and you
  can shew us the line, wherein you came from the Pope, and so through his loines
  from the other: there is no other way for your ministry to prove its pedigree
  from the Primitive times but this, no way for you to climb up to the Apostles
  as the fathers, and founders of your function but by a chain of many linkes,
  whereof if one happen <pb n="361" facs="tcp:42067:185"/> to prove unsound, and tis a chance
  but a flaw may be found in some of them, that have been trailed for many
  hundreds of years together through the hands of that <hi>Apostaticall</hi>
  harlot, the intaile is clear cut of, your pedigree and descent from the
  Apostles, as a ministry, perishes, is spilt upon the ground, and can never be
  tact on again any more for ever: you have hitherto owned your ordination as
  handed by an uninterrupted lineal succession from the Pope to the present
  <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and if we put the question to the veriest novice or
  youngling among you, who ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you? and who ordained those that ordained
  you? and who them? and who them? and who them? you can find your function
  flowing in a continual stream from the Primitive fountain no other way, but
  through that stinking sink and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt channel of the holy chaire; <hi>Pope
  Gregory</hi> the great gave power of ordination to <hi>Austin</hi> the
  <hi>Monk,</hi> when he sent him over into <hi>England</hi> about a thousand
  years since, he to the <hi>Popish Bishops,</hi> they to the <hi>Protestant
  Bishops,</hi> they to the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,</hi> and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> to

  <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> came i. e. departed from the
  <hi>Apostles,</hi> and thus from the Apostles you came all, but thither you
  must go again, letting go your sweet succession, and from their words, which
  are the same now as then, begin your businesse again before you can be

  enough each for the other, but of the Church in <hi>England,</hi> which is
  <hi>vera Ecclesia</hi> the true Church indeed, you shall never be the Ministry
  for me, till you repent and be baptized.</p>
               <p>As for my self whom you deem to be no Minister of the Gospel, I
  must not lead you so far from the other work in hand as to stand upon the proof
  of that now, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing transgressed (as some will think) too far already, though
  else it were no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible thing to prove it, and therefore I say this only in
  short that whether I am now a true Minister of the Gospel or no, tis now my
  utmost aim to preach and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the truth of it as tis in Jesus, but as for
  the time in, which I was owned a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Gospel, I was at that time no
  true one at all, yea though I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy, and such mercy as to be
  made a Minister thereof since, because I did what I did ignorantly, yet so far
  was I then from a Minister of the Gospell that I rather rejected the counsell
  of God against my self, being not baptized of them that preached it, and
  disputed much against it as well as you.</p>

  satisfactorily before, that unlesse you have more to say against it then to
  miscal it, as you do, before you have proved it to be so base as you are
  pleased to stile it, I shall rejoice in Christ Jesus that hath chosen such
  foolish and base things as dipping in water is, in the account of men however
  excellent in it self, and in proof of its warrantableness, unles it be
  occasionally, add no more.</p>

  in that point, will be of your mind, and follow your fashion therein, for
  whereas you say that dipping was the custome in the <pb n="362" facs="tcp:42067:186"/>
  first times, and therefore go about to seduce men into the belief of it,
  because its said that the Eunuch went down into the water, and that</hi> John

  that is a thing never proved by any, and that the</hi> Jaylor <hi>was baptized
  in the night in his own house, and therefore not likely over head in that
  Countrey, where water was so scarce, and that the Eunuch might well be said to
  go down into the water, for the Country was mountanous, and the brooks in the

  ascending from the water, for as Christ was pleased to be baptized with water,

  all others, but himself, do read <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 38. thus <hi>they went down
  both</hi> into <hi>the water and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended</hi> out of <hi>the water,</hi> to
  demand of him in his own words to <hi>A. R.</hi> whether he <hi>think that our
  Translators, and most or all others, who english those passages by</hi> into
  <hi>the water, knew not how to render the originall in its proper signification
  as well as himself?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the other two, viz. Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> and Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> they foreseeing no doubt it would be no safe, handsome,
  acceptable, nor advantagious way to take upon them, as they saw Mr.
  <hi>Cook</hi> did, to correct the Translators, and mend their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
  they are more wary then Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> in that particular, and so (thus
  <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidit in Scillam, qui vult,</hi> &amp;c.) to decline the Rock of
  insolence, they drop into the gulf of nonsence, owning the original to be
  rightly rendred, and reading them according to that rendition, <hi>viz.
  into</hi> the water, and up <hi>out of</hi> the water, yet denying those
  phrases they descended <hi>into</hi> the water, and came up <hi>out of</hi> the
  wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,, to sound out any more then Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> saies the <hi>Greek</hi>
  words do <hi>viz. to</hi> and <hi>from</hi> the water.</p>
               <p>But I must intreat those two Parallels in that opinion, to
  consider what impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleld improprietie it is to expresse no more then going to
  the water side, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from it again by these phrases, <hi>viz.</hi>
  going down <hi>into</hi> the water, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming <hi>out of</hi> the water for
  they imply necessarily a being <hi>in</hi> the water, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at it: he
  descended <hi>into</hi> hell is more then being at the brinks of hell, he
  des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended <hi>into</hi> the lower parts of the Earth, is more then bare being
  on the superficies of the Earth, and so he descended <hi>into</hi> the water,
  is necessarily more then being <hi>at</hi> the side: the situation of the water
  below in the bottoms will not salve the absurdity of such expression,
  concerning being at the water only, and returning, for he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
  <hi>to</hi> it, and ascended <hi>from</hi> it is enough for that, but to
  expresse that only by <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> it and <hi>out of</hi> it, is superfluous
  and superlative simplicity: whatsoever element, or place in any element we are
  said to go down into, and come up out of we were once in or else we are fowlly
  belied: had it been said of <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> they went
  down both <hi>to</hi> the water, or <hi>into</hi> the bottoms, they descended
  <hi>into</hi> the vallies, where the water was, as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> prates by
  a <hi>Periphrasis,</hi> and when they came up <hi>out of</hi> the valley, or
  bottom from the water, then it had shewed som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like the sense these men
  like best and long to have it in, but <hi>into</hi> the water, and <hi>out
  of</hi> the water expresse not only a bare being in the bottomes, where the
  wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was but <hi>in</hi> the water also; for whatsoever place or element is
  put after the prepositions <hi>into</hi> and <hi>out of</hi> is a place or
  element that the persons denominated to <hi>go</hi> into and <hi>out of</hi>
  were once really and truly <hi>in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Daniel</hi> was thrown <hi>into</hi> and taken up <hi>out
  of</hi> the Lyons den, does not that shew plainly enough that he was
  <hi>in</hi> it? the Swine ran <hi>into</hi> the sea, were they not then in it?
  I threw it <hi>into</hi> the fire (saies <hi>Aaron</hi> of the molten image he
  made) and there came out this calf, will any say that the mettals he made it of
  were only warmed at the fire side? they went down both <hi>into</hi> the water,
  both <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> and came up <hi>out of</hi> the
  water, <hi>Iesus</hi> was baptized of <hi>Iohn into Iordan, Mark</hi> 1. 9. and
  when he was baptized went straitway <hi>out of</hi> the water, <hi>Math.</hi>
  3. 16. can any man say that these two persons <hi>Iesus</hi> and the
  <hi>Eunuch,</hi> of whom also Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> grants that they were
  baptized <hi>in</hi> the River, were never <hi>in</hi> it at all, but only
  wetted at the water side?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:42067:188"/> But that <hi>Philip</hi> and the
  <hi>Eunuch</hi> went into and were in the water, and not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> it and
  <hi>at</hi> it only, is evident by what I have hinted once already,
  <hi>viz.</hi> in that it is said they were come <hi>unto</hi> the water before,
  and therefore this mustneeds be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> it, or else either the Spirit
  <hi>Tautologized,</hi> or they <hi>tautopoiized,</hi> and came <hi>unto</hi>
  the water twice over, but never <hi>into</hi> it at all.</p>
               <p>Two more odd conceits, and emblemes of the emptinesse of their
  apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this point, two a piece I mean in Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr.
  <hi>Blake,</hi> I shall take notice of briefly in their fore-cited shuffles,
  and so passe on to the rest.</p>
               <p>First, how peartly doth Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> squitch up <hi>A.
  R.</hi> with a question or two as if he would catechise him in that which he
  hath yet need to be further chatechisd himself?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Must they not go down to the water</hi> (saith he) <hi>if
  they would use it? would the water come up to them in the Chariot any sooner
  for sprinkling then for dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer to which question, I intreat Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> to ask
  his conscience this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether if they had used the water only for
  sprinkling, there was such nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssity of going down to it as he seemes to
  intimate, would not the water have come up to them in the Chariot sooner by far
  for sprinkling then for dipping? yea verily both <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>the
  Eunuch</hi> might have sat still in the Chariot and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded water enough for
  sprinkling to be brought up to them thither in the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the Chariot
  drivers hand, if there were no bigger a vessel to bear it in, but for dipping
  enough could never possibly be brought up into the Chariot at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>he must,</hi> saies he of Christ, <hi>go down and
  come up from the water, but here is not the least hint that</hi> John
  <hi>doused Christ over head, or under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nay rather that conceit of
  yours,</hi> saith he to A. R. <hi>is here confuted, for if our blessed Saviour
  had been plunged of</hi> John into <hi>the water, then it would rather have
  been said that</hi> John <hi>cast or plunged Christ into the water, and took
  him</hi> out of <hi>the water, but it is only implied that Christ went
  down</hi> unto <hi>the water and came up again</hi> from <hi>it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O how egregiously, how shamefully doth this man forget, and
  utter himself as if his senses were sodden into <hi>Trapizuntius</hi> his
  temper! I would therfore ask him one or two questions <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First: whether <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth at all signifie to
  douse over head, or under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or to plunge into water yea or no? if not
  (but I suppose he will not deny it so to do, though he denies it to signifie
  onely plunging) then I would have him to go to school again to the
  <hi>Lexicons</hi> which will teach him that it mainly signifies <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
  immergo, submergo,</hi> and if <hi>lavo, a bluo</hi> it is such an ablu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ion as is made <hi>immergendo,</hi>
  but if it doth signifie to plunge dip or douse under water, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm at
  all, and I dare say he and every one else shall find it for all <hi>lavo, quod
  fit immergendo,</hi> to signifie a swilling in water altogether, then I advise
  him to be think himself, for I think he was asleep when he wrote this passage,
  that there is at least some little hint that <hi>Iohn</hi> plunged Christ into
  the water, when its said Christ was baptized <hi>alias, plunged, dipt</hi> of
  <hi>Iohn</hi> into <hi>Iordan,</hi> or washt <hi>in Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> sith that
  pleases himself, unless he put a difference between the active and the passive
  and will not yield it to be all one, that <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized Christ, and
  Christ was baptized of <hi>John,</hi> but though it be said Christ was baptized
  i. e. plunged of <hi>Iohn</hi> into <hi>Iordan,</hi> overwhelmed in
  <hi>Iordan,</hi> and that he came out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is a shrewd sign
  that <hi>Iohn</hi> did not keep him there, yet this is not plain and
  significant enough for him it seems unlesse he may have the framing of the
  spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits speech another way, that is no whit plainer then the other neither,
  <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Iohn</hi> cast or plunged Christ into the water, and
  took him out of the water, unlesse it may be said just so all that is said,
  which yet is the same with that he would have to be said, implies no more then
  that Christ went down unto the water and <pb n="368" facs="tcp:42067:189"/> and came up
  again from it, without being baptized, so belike: how <hi>A. R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that <hi>Iohn</hi>
  doused Christ under water, which is also mine, and the very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
  expression the original can be read in, is confuted by those texts <hi>Mat. 3.
  16. Mark.</hi> 1. 9. 10. I can no more conceive, then I can conceive that this
  expression <hi>viz. Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> went down both
  <hi>into</hi> the water, and he baptized him, is a confutation of him that
  supposes the Eunuch to be baptized at all, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that their ascension was but from the water, but I muse
  why he would not set down the words of the other Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> the
  8. 39. which expounds this, and where tis <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The second thing more observable in Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi>
  businesse runs thus, First, saith he, <hi>howsoever one or two examples serve
  not your purpose, but a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curren ce of all examples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See how Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> heart misgives him; and well nigh
  wavers within, whether he had not best yield us these two examples, for all his
  tugging for them before, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our cause, and therefore now falls, for fear
  these two will side against him, to serve himself against them another way, i.
  e. by denying that the te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>mony of
  the spirit in these two examples, is of any validity to us without a
  concurrence of all examples:</p>
               <p>To which I say, had Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> but one half inch of an
  example in the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>baby baptism</hi> how much he would make
  of it we may see by his cunning counterfeit examples for that thing out of
  scriptures, that in truth are not onely far from exemplifying such a thing, as
  the housholds he makes use of are, but also clear examples to the contrary, as
  the non-baptizing of those very infants that were brought to Christ, and the
  non-baptizing of those very infants with their parents <hi>Act.</hi> the 2. to
  whose parents, and their children to, on the same termes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance when at
  years, the promise is there made: both which Scriptures he wrests into his
  turne, yea verily, and had he but one true single example of any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
  baptized in all that word, we should lay down to him, and never open our
  mouthes more against infant baptism: yet if these two examples do prove for us,
  it seemes they shall not be heeded, whilst against them, unlesse there be a
  general concurrence of all examples.</p>
               <p>Wherefore secondly, I tell him of a truth that though me thinks
  the single exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord Iesus might content him, and of the Eunuch, for
  can he shew a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter example then these? yet theres as general a concurrence
  of all examples in this particular, as there is of the example of any one
  thing, that is exemplified in the Scriptures: all <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> all
  <hi>Iudea,</hi> and the Region about <hi>Iordan</hi> were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized i. e. dipt
  of <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Iordan</hi> confessing their sins, Christ dipt of
  <hi>Iohn</hi> into <hi>Iordan,</hi> the Eunuch going <hi>into</hi> the water
  and there baptized, baptizing <hi>in Aenon</hi> because much water, and indeed
  the very word baptize makes them all examples of our practise, while it
  signifies <hi>obruo, submergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly saies he, <hi>we have examples giving full evidence of
  a different practise, and nothing can be concluded for you from these examples
  of yours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> examples it seems for his different practise
  must conclude for him, but our examples though never so clear must conclude
  nothing for us, <hi>ipse dixit</hi> Mr. <hi>Bl.</hi> hath forbidden them so to
  do, and therefore we must sign <hi>ne plus ul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  cease.</p>
               <p>Onely secondly, I hope he will give me leave to ask him what
  different practise it is he meanes, of which he hath examples giving full
  evidence against ours, and if it be either baptism of infants, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  ile promise him faithfully that upon his giving us any one example that gives

  him following Christ in that or any thing else, and that for ever: till then he
  must excuse me if in love to his soul I seriously beseech him to search and try
  his wayes and turn in truth to that truth of the Lord Iesus he yet tramples

               <p>See first how Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> contradicts himself in that

               <p>To say nothing of the invalidity of this piece to his purpose,
  nor needlessenesse of the Scriptures mentioning the particular place where
  every one was baptized, for what if that be not specified every where where
  baptism is talked on, least the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume should swell, is it not as much as to
  say they were dipped in that it is said they were baptized, i. e. <hi>submersi,
  obruti, abluti immergendo,</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies mainly, I
  suppose I may safely say only such washing as is by dousing, dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or
  swilling, specially since in places enough it is said they were baptized in
  Rivers, and places of much water: but to say nothing I say of that, mark how
  this clause of Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> clashes with another of his within a matter of
  ten lines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from it, for there giving other reasons, then that of
  dipping, why <hi>Iohn</hi> chose to baptize in Rivers and running waters, among
  others he gives this as a speciall one, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Because of the multitudes that were baptized,
  especially</hi> saith he, <hi>seeing there came such huge multitudes to him to
  be baptized,</hi> and yet here were great <pb n="370" facs="tcp:42067:190"/> multitudes
  baptized even no lesse then 3000 and yet sith there is no mention of the place
  where, which by Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> own reason, if it be a reason, must be a
  place of running waters, and streams that many might be imploied at once in
  bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing along the river, for the more speedy dispatch, with so great
  multitudes, therefore these belike went not out to the rivers, though yet
  theres no more menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned that they did not, then that they did.</p>
               <p>There were thousands of converts <hi>Act.</hi> the 4. the 4. of
  the matter of whose baptism there is no more mentioned then of the manner of
  it, and yet there is ground enough to believe they were all baptized, as well
  as the rest, yea Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> believes it, and in the same way as the
  rest whose baptism with the manner of it is expressed, for why should others be
  baptized in rivers because they were multitudes, and yet these multitudes be
  exempted from that and be dispached with so small a matter as sprinkling?
  therefore the not mentioning twas done, is an argument as good as nothing; and
  whereas he saies there is no mentioning of fetching in great store of waters,
  tis true, that we never read at all of water fetcht to the persons, but of
  persons going to the water we do, though he saies we do not, for even
  <hi>Lydia</hi> her self and her family, which is no other then his own
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, were gone out to a river side to hear <hi>Paul</hi> preach, where
  being converted they were baptized, that being the wonted place of preaching
  and praying no doubt in order to the conveniency of baptizing, before ever the
  Apostles were so much as invited to her house.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of this stamp also is Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> conceit
  concerning the baptism of <hi>Paul,</hi> who because the particular place or
  sourse of water wherein he was baptized is not expressed, imagins that he must
  needs be baptized within doors, and no where else, and so consequently not by
  dipping, but some other way, whereas there is neither necessity nor probability
  of his being so, but rather evidence if not from the very place, yet at least
  from what Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saies that it was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; For</p>
               <p>First, it seemes to me that <hi>Paul</hi> was not to be baptized
  within, but to go some where or other to the dispatching of that businesse,
  wherefore else should <hi>Ananias</hi> rub him up to it as he doth in such wise
  as this, and <hi>now why tariest thou? arise and be baptized and wash away thy
  sins</hi> &amp;c. Which as it Argues it was a service <hi>Paul</hi> was tardy
  to, and I know no mans flesh forward to it further then by faith it is
  overpowred, specially in such a weak case as <hi>Paul</hi> it seemes was in at
  that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, so it was as who should say, why art thou so undisposed to thy
  duty in that particular, make hast, and linger not longer about it, but come
  away and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: now had aspersion or infusion been only the work,
  <hi>Paul</hi> could not have bin so backward as to need such sharp
  exsuscitation, when once convinced, for theres no such great unpleasantness to
  the flesh, as to engender any aversenesse unto that, but that <hi>Paul</hi> was
  more tardy then he should have been (and why he should be so I know not if
  among the other impediments, at least he was not sensible of some tediousnesse
  in the service) was uttered in a publique exercise once from that very text
  <hi>Acts.</hi> 22. 16. by a friend of yours, and mine now deceased, at his
  sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling one of mine own children, in which Sermon the doctrine was this
  (and a good doctrine it was, and very truly grounded upon the Example of
  <hi>Pauls dulnesse</hi> in that Scripture, and further cleered by <hi>Lots</hi>
  loitering in <hi>Sodom)</hi> viz. <hi>That by reason partly of the remainder of
  corruption in the best, presenting evill when they should do Good, and partly
  the great grand enemy of our salvation Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, opposing himself to all good,
  the best that have even renounced their vile life, have an indisposition to
  holy duties, and have need of excitation and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again had he not either been to be baptized within by dipping or
  been to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive within an aspersion or infusion upon his face only he need not
  to have bin bid to arise, or stand up in order to either of these, so much as
  from the present posture <pb n="371" facs="tcp:42067:190"/> he was in, for if he were then
  sitting, face rantism might have been done as well, and if he were lying down
  (which in his then case is the more likely of the two) much better then in a
  standing posture, in which tis not so easie to dispence a pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the
  face, least pouring so little as you do it prove rather a Rantism then a
  baptism, or pouring so much as the baptizer should do on the disciple, if he
  will needs do it by pouring i. e. till he hath buried him in baptism, or wholly
  covered him with water, in resemblance of the spiritual, he make way for his
  bodily buriall in the earth also.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saies thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
  that though the <hi>Eunuch</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the River might saie heres wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>er what hinders why I should not be
  dipped, yet there is little probability that <hi>Paul</hi> could say so in
  <hi>Iudas</hi> his house in <hi>straight street</hi> in <hi>Damascus,</hi> or
  the <hi>Iaylor</hi> at his Prison in <hi>Phillippi,</hi> I say it is very
  like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was so indeed, that they had not any Ponds or Rivers in their
  houses, to dip in, but will it follow therefore that they were baptized in the
  house without dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? no such matter by Mr. <hi>Bls.</hi> favour, but rather
  that sith there was not water enough for their dipping within doors, as there
  was for the Eunuchs dipping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, therefore they went out to some water or
  other that they might be baptized, i. e. dipped conveniently, as the Eunuch
  was, and that may possibly not be farre, for many a one that hath not brooks
  nor ponds in their houses, yet have them oft not far from their doors, and that
  <hi>Iudas</hi> had not so who can tell? but whether he had or no, the matter is
  not great, sith he lived not far from much water however whilest he was living
  in <hi>Damascus,</hi> for were not <hi>Abana</hi> and <hi>Parphar</hi> Rivers
  of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus</hi> though not for <hi>Namans</hi> disease, yet for dipping
  full as good as <hi>Iordan</hi> it self, and all other waters of Israel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, See how miserably Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is mistaken, he
  would make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if they would be such Idiots, as to take his single
  word for it, against the expresse word of God, that in the <hi>Countrey</hi> of
  the <hi>Iaylor</hi> water was so scarce that he could not be dipped over head,
  whereas (oh that Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> would see how the Lord hath left him to
  discover his too hasty galloping over the Sripture) it is related that a River
  ran just by the same City of <hi>Phillippi</hi> where he dwelt, even that, by
  the side of which Paul preached, and prayer was wont to be made, where also
  <hi>Lidya,</hi> and her houshold were converted and baptized, and all this no
  further off then in the very same chapter, where the <hi>Iaylors</hi> baptism
  is spoken of <hi>viz. Acts</hi> 16. 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>I perceive this scarcity of water is made a mighty Argument
  among you against dipping, some saying that water for dipping was not to be had
  in the houses of the disciples that were baptized, therefore they received no
  more then some asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or infusion within, some speaking as though water
  for dipping were not to be had in whole Cities and Countreys where the
  disciples dwelt, thus doth not onely Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who denies a
  sufficiencie of water for dipping over head to be in that Country where the
  Jaylor dwelt, but also Senior Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> one of you my
  <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> opposers, who in a letter under his hand to a neighbor of his
  (much of which is <hi>partim directe &amp; verbatim partim oblique &amp;
  collateraliter,</hi> out of Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> so that it stands or falls in
  him, and of the rest that is not translated thence into his turn, some already
  is, and some that is not yet, is to be spoken to as I go along) tells us that
  <hi>there was not any water in</hi> Jerusalem <hi>wherein so many as were there
  baptized, in so short a time, at that time of the year when water was more
  scanty, could possibly have been dipped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a strange conceit is this? what not water enough in nor yet
  about all <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> to dipp a man over head in? for sith he saies not
  so many, the same water course I hope that one can be dipped in, may also serve
  to dipp a thousand; shall we think that in the greatest drought that could
  happen all those brooks the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures mentions <hi>viz. Cedron</hi> and
  <hi>Siloam,</hi> and the fountain of <hi>Gyhon,</hi> and the Conduit of the
  upper pool, which ran with several streams, and were at one place all
  coincident with <hi>Cedron,</hi> were dryed up so that not a place could be
  found of <pb n="372" facs="tcp:42067:191"/> any competent depth for men to dip in?</p>
               <p>But perhaps what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saies concerning
  <hi>Aenon</hi> upon the report of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers <hi>viz.</hi> that even the River
  <hi>Aenon it self where</hi> Iohn <hi>baptized because there was much water, is
  found to be a small brook, that a man may almost step over,</hi> or as I find
  it expressed to me in a letter to a neer and deer friend of mine, upon the
  credit of eye witnesse historians, <hi>Aenon was but a small purl scarcely knee
  deep at the deepest,</hi> so Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> may say, but it is on his own
  head if he do, concerning these brooks, that were about <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to
  all which I shall for brevities sake dispatch this answer here now I am about
  it.</p>
               <p>And first I intreat Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> to consider that this
  serves not his turn howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if <hi>Cedron</hi> and <hi>Siloam,</hi> and the
  rest that were without the City, and the stream also that ran through the City,
  from the fountain of the old pool into <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,</hi> should be all such as
  <hi>Aenon</hi> is supposed to be, sith the fishpool <hi>Bethesda,</hi> at which
  lay a great multitude of impotents, and into which one amongst the rest desired
  to be put, or cast (for the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) but could not, was
  both deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and broader then so, and convenient for many to dip in at once,
  for if we may credit <hi>Bethesda</hi> it self, the very name instructs us in
  no lesse <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> being in english no other then the house of
  flowing down, so called for the concurrence, and confluence of many waters
  thereinto, see <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place, who tells you that it was a pool
  he thinks, into which water did flow down continually, through either channels
  or pipes, that the Priests (for it was neer the Temple) might as well be
  furnisht with water for their sacrifices, as the people were with sacrifices
  themselves in the sheep market wherein it was; others think, and as I take it
  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> in his Anotations, that it was a pool at which cattel drank, and
  in which they used to be plunged; <hi>whereof</hi> saith he <hi>there could not
  but be great store in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem:</hi> so much may well serve without any more
  to salve the sore eyes of Mr. <hi>Simpson.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ile bate him his <hi>almost.</hi> and
  yet he will not get much by the matter, for as I have seen others baptized by
  totall dipping in the like, so was I seen to be baptized my self in a place of
  so little latitude, that an active man might make shift to step over, not
  almost but altogether, in which yet there is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enough left behind to
  baptize a thousand, if not a million more in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and so, not to
  say how possible it is, if not a thousand to one that <hi>Aenons</hi> eye
  witnesses never sounded <hi>Aenons</hi> depth in all places, nor secondly how
  possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a brook might be much swerved up since then, &amp; somwhat shallowed
  in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Generations, nor thirdly how possible it is to deepen the
  shallowest stream that is very easily in order to such a purpose, for I have
  seen ancle deep streams so ordered as I speak of, more then once or twice for a
  need, though that <hi>Aenon</hi> had need to be made deeper in those places,
  where <hi>Iohn</hi> did baptize, may be twenty times told by some Travellers,
  that love to hear themselves talk, before I shall believe it once;</p>
               <p>Not to say any thing I say of these, let <hi>Aenon</hi> be but
  knee deep if you will, ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perience hath so taught the expedience of knee deep
  to dip in to my self, and other Baptizers that I know, that as we have dipt
  persons oft where it hath not bin so deep, so, except in such a channel where
  we cannot well avoid it, we choose now not to go in much deeper.</p>
               <p>See Fourthly how all your three Worthies Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> do deceive you, as being indeed deceived
  themselves, and that in a manner so plain that none but <hi>Blind Seers</hi>
  can look beside it, for though each of the three were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in each of those
  other errors, which they severally utter in your last joint quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and
  confident commendation of them, yet (wo is me may <hi>England</hi> say that my
  leaders are so misled) the whole Trinity of them is at unity, but against all
  veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this, even in the very thing in which principally you would have us
  mind them, for whereas, as an instance that baptism was not by dipping, they
  all alledge that <pb n="373" facs="tcp:42067:191"/> the <hi>Iailor</hi> was baptized at
  midnight in his house, and therefore probably not in such a way as dipping,
  that he was baptized about midnight is true enough, but that he was baptized in
  his house, is so contrary to truth, that a very child may find the falsenesse
  of that assertion, for howbeit Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> saies plain-ly, <hi>its like
  the waters they had within doores at midnight sufficed, and Mr.</hi> Baxter
  more plain-ly, <hi>that the Iailor was baptized in the nightin his house,</hi>
  and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> most plain-ly, <hi>tis sure there was not many waters
  nor rivers in the Iailors dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and it is as sure that they i. e.</hi> the
  Iailor and the Apostles <hi>went not out in the night to any such places as
  were fit to dip in,</hi> yet what saith the word in plain truth? no lesse then
  this, that the Iailor after he was baptized <hi>brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his house
  and set meat before them, and rejoiced:</hi> for it is said first, that upon
  the earth-quake, and <hi>Pauls</hi> crying out to him, that he should do
  him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self no harm, the <hi>Iailor hasted into Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas and
  brought them out,</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that they upon his then inquiry told him what
  he should do to be saved, and <hi>preached the word to him and all his,</hi>
  whereupon in this intertime, i. e. between the time of the Iailors bringing
  them out, and his bringing them in again, <hi>he took them and washed their
  stripes, and was baptized he and all his straightway.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that
  when he had brought them into his house,</hi> which words compared with verse
  the 30. where it is said <hi>he brought them out,</hi> shew clearly that he,
  and his were with them still without hearing the word, washing them, and
  sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to be baptized i. e. <hi>immergendo</hi> washed of them, he made
  them eat, and <hi>rejoiced:</hi> now what man, but one minded to overlook what
  likes him not, can chuse but see this to the confutation of these three mens
  opinions? which I doubt because it is theirs more then any thing else, may be
  the opinion of 3000: that the Iailor first brought them out, and then washed
  their stripes, and was baptized, and then brought them in, and rejoiced with
  them is clear.</p>

  parts:</p>
               <p>The next exception I find Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> makes against what

  dip, and so is taken when applied to other things as Mar.</hi> the 7. 4. 8. and
  herein he sums up in short the whole mind of Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr.
  <hi>Blake</hi> also in this matter, who say <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> p.

  <hi>Cook</hi> p. 11. to A. R. much what the very same <hi>viz.</hi> that
  baptism signifies washing, and p. 13. quoting the same Scripture <hi>Mark</hi>
  the 7. <hi>here you have</hi> saith he, <hi>the word</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To all which I answer, but briefly, having toucht at this

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifies to

  signifies a washing, dipping being not a dipping onely, but necessarily a

               <p>The third exception of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> against what hath

               <p>
                  <hi>The thing signifyed is set forth by the phrase of washing or

               <p>And in this fashion argue both Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> and Mr.

  that hath but half an eye may see Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> borrowed most of that
  little he saies in exception against what we say for dipping; abridging two or
  three pages of Mr. <hi>Cook, viz.</hi> page 19, 20, 21. into these two or three
  lines of his, and coting the same Scriptures, and no other, and that in the
  self same order, and no other, then Mr. <hi>Cooke</hi> doth, <hi>viz.</hi> the
  1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. Tit. 3. 5. Heb. 10. 22. Isa. 44. 3. Ioel 2. 28. Ezek. 36. 26.

               <p>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:42067:193"/> To which I say it is true, some but not
  all the things signified, nor yet that which is most immediately signified, and
  therefore mainly to be resembled, are set forth by the phrase of washing,
  pouring and sprinkling, and it is as true that the sign need not exceed the
  thing signified, but the sign need be adaequate to the thing signified, and so
  is not any kind of washing, but that of dipping under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor doth that
  exceed the thing signified, for that which is the main matter, the
  <hi>signandum</hi> or the radical matter to all the rest, is the death, burial
  and resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, and ours spiritually with him, which things are no
  way <hi>Analogized</hi> in sprinkling and pouring, but onely by a burial under
  water, and bringing up again, which yet are the only things that these three
  men plead to have left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signifyed, and unrepresented in the sign, but we must
  have them all not only sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, but also, as much as may be, lively pictured
  out in the sign of baptism, this cannot be by infufion or aspersion, for they
  are too narrow to resemble all, but they may be and are in submersion and
  immersion, for these are neither too narrow, nor too wide, but just adaequately
  resembling the <hi>signata, there must be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in the sign to the
  end</hi> saies Mr. <hi>Cook p.</hi> 20. namely <hi>to represent the spirituall
  grace,</hi> though yet p. 17. <hi>he knew not any word of God, wherein this
  represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is necessarily either expressed or implied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the whole spiritual grace being the death, burial and
  resurrection of Christ, together with all the benefits thereof, <hi>viz.</hi>
  the washing of our souls from guilt as to justification, from filth as to
  sanctification, as by the blood of Christ sprinkled and his spirit poured,
  respect must be had that, as neer as can be, all these must be represented, and
  that the Elements and actions be neither so overmuch, as may take off the heart
  from the spiritual to the Corporal thing, as we might easily do if we should do
  more then dipp under, and raise up, or should hold so long under water as
  almost to suffocate the subject, nor yet so little, as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> saies
  well, as not clearly to represent the spiritual grace the whole spiritual
  gracebeing therfore all these things forenamed, care must be had that they be
  all <hi>Analogized,</hi> as far as it is possible, and especially the main,
  which is fundamental to all the rest, <hi>viz.</hi> Christs death, burial and
  resurrection; for this however ought to be done, nor ought the other altogether
  to be left undone, but it sprinkling be the way then the main thing is left
  undone, for there is no representation of Christs death, buriall and
  resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p>Not so neither with your leave, for howbeit in bare infusion,

               <p>Moreover that remission of sins by the blood of Christ sprinkled
  is represented sufficiently in emersion, as well as in aspersion, not so the
  death, burial and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection in Aspersion consult a learned Author for this,
  that was for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersion as well as your selves, though I believe he saw

  you have yet spoken to whereby he cleerly evinces it, that baptism was not only
  by dipping then: I hope we shall have your answer to them too, and the rather
  because they are of some weight, and therefore you are the more willing to slip
  by them: First (saith he) if the way of baptism were only dipping, then the
  Baptizer must put the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed over head in the water, and after a space
  receive them up again, otherwise he could not say in your sense I baptize thee,
  but we read of no such thing any where in Scripture, we find Christ and the

  down both into the water, and <hi>Philip</hi> baptized him, and that Christ
  came up out of the water, and that <hi>Philip</hi> and the Eunuch came up out
  of the water, if all this be not partly an expression, partly an implication of
  the same thing that Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> saies we no where read of, then I shall
  never trust my spectacles more, for what shall we think was done to Christ by
  <hi>Iohn</hi> when it is said he was baptized by him into <hi>Iordan,</hi> if
  he was not dipped, overwhelmed put under the water? was he sprinkled into
  <hi>Iordan?</hi> and what shall we think <hi>Philip</hi> did to the Eunuch when
  it is said he baptized him, after they were both gone down into the water, if
  he did not put him under it? did he no more then sprinkle, or pour a few drops
  of water on him? either of those might have been done as easily, and more if
  they had never gone into the water, yea

  to the water at all; and when it is said of <hi>Christ</hi> and the
  <hi>Eunuch</hi> that they came up out of the water, is it not necessarily

  for a man for the most part to dip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and divinity doth not admit of

               <p>I think Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> of <hi>Bethersden,</hi> and you
  have laid your heads together, you jump so right in one mind in this matter,
  for in this manner, and almost in the very same words doth he speak in that
  letter of his I spake of above, divinity admits not say you of
  <hi>se-baptism</hi> &amp;c. what your <hi>sinodical</hi> divinity admits of as
  good baptism I weigh not, and what you call <hi>se-baptism</hi> I know not, but
  if you call that self-baptizing for the baptized to go with the baptizer into
  the water, and there submit himself to be overwhelmed in the water by the hands
  of the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator putting him under, the Scripture admits of such a
  <hi>se-baptism</hi> as this, and if we had no command for acting so far in
  order to our own baptism, yet we have president so plain as is equivalent,
  witnesse the <hi>Eunuch</hi> that went down with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> into the
  water, and yet (saving your ignorance, which permits not the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to be
  agents) <hi>Paul</hi> had command to be so farre an agent in order to his
  bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism as to do more then barely sit still <hi>viz.</hi> to arise, and put
  himself in a posture sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to that purpose, neither can you totally deny
  him to be truly baptized and overwhelmed in water according to the will of
  Christ (and that is sufficient) that betakes himself not onely to the water,
  but also so farre into it, that the dispenser may conveniently put him under
  it, unlesse you suppose that the dispenser of old did carry the disciple in
  upon his back, and then dash him in against his will, and that were in the
  disciple the part of a proper patient indeed; besides doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned mans
  being agent, and assistant so far toward the cutting off of his head, as toly
  down, and fit his neck to the block make him a <hi>se-slayer,</hi> or accessary

  after baptism, when yet sometimes there had been all reason for the mention of
  it, as in the case of</hi> Paul, <hi>of whom after he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, it is said
  he received meat, and was strengthned, but not that apparell was put on him,

               <p>If by putting off of clothes Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> mean, as it

  them off as is in order to putting on others fit for such a purpose in their

  nor yet does Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> I dare say, though in his expressions viz.
  <hi>that informer dayes it was thought no immodesty, and that there is no
  necessity that persons be dipt naked,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> is so abominably
  un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous as to wrest his words into such base and sinister senses, and to
  abuse him to the world as if he had meant it was no immodesty in old time to be
  dipt naked, and as if he held it lawfull to be dipt naked, though not
  necessary, when inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity <pb n="380" facs="tcp:42067:195"/> of judgement, and such love
  as he pretends to Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued his meaning to be
  this, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was counted no immodesty in former times, though it
  be now by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> to be dipt in that way, wherein we are dipt,
  which is not naked, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> bruits it, and that it is not
  necessary to be dipt naked, as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr.
  <hi>Cook</hi> think it is, if persons be baptized by a totall dipping; and as
  for the Scriptures mentioning of the putting off, and on of their clothes in
  their addresses to, and dresses after baptism, there was not onely no
  necessity, but at all no expediency in the mention of such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: yea both
  reason and nature it self suggesting how needful that was to be done, it would
  have been very vain and superfluous to have talked on it: as for the double
  mention that is made <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Luke Acts</hi> 7. 58. of the
  witnesses that stoned <hi>Stephen laying aside their garments at the feet of a
  young man, whose name was Saul,</hi> who is said <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 1. to be
  <hi>consenting to his death,</hi> and also by <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
  <hi>Act.</hi> the 22. 20. confessing to God his persecutions, and how when the
  blood of the Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> was shed he was standing by and
  <hi>consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of them that shew him,</hi>
  Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> cannot be so silly as to think that that clause concerning
  those mens clothes was put in as a piece remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or worth recording of it
  self, or in any other respect in the world, save for this end onely as it was
  an expression of the malice, that <hi>Saul,</hi> who was afterward converted
  and called <hi>Paul,</hi> did at that time bear against the truth, for surely
  had there not been that good reason wherefore, the laying aside of their
  clothes had not been worth our notice, nor should it ever have been mentioned
  simply for it self sake; but now there was no such weighty end as this nor any
  end, or purpose at all in order to which it was needfull to mention the
  circumstance of their clothing, and unclothing about the administration of
  baptism, it is enough that we have record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the thing in the

                  </gap> viz. that, and how, and why it
  was done, but it would have been frustraneous, and even every way endlesse to
  have minded us of such impertinent appertenances to baptism as the dressing and
  undressing of the disciples: if any one tell me a story that such and such
  infants were sprinkled at such places, is not that relation sufficient, and
  compleat unlesse he tell me how the infants were drest in their blankets, and
  what a fidling was made by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, and the minister about the unpinning
  and turning up of their face clothes? is not the story of <hi>Naamans</hi>
  washing himself seven times in <hi>Iordan</hi> full enough to our use, because
  there is no mention of his putting off and on? Christ washt his disciples feet,
  and wiped them, it may well be supposed they put off their shoes first, and put
  them on again, yet there is no mention of that: Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> thinks that
  among all the multitudes that were baptized there must have been some words
  about their unclothings, and clothings, and specially that there was reason
  that we should have heard that <hi>Paul</hi> had dry and warm clothes put on
  him after his baptism, as well as mention of meat given him, if he had been
  baptized by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersion, because he had been weak; but what crude conceits are
  all these? it was related that he was weak through fasting three daies, and
  that was but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and answering to the other to tell how after he eat his
  meat, and gathered strength, but the other must have come in (for ought I see)
  without either sense or reason: and sith he stranges that among so many
  baptized, no mention should be made of their preparations <hi>viz.</hi> the
  seponing, and resuming their garments, I wonder what mention he finds of the
  accommodations that those multitudes had that were circumcised in
  <hi>Ahrahams</hi> family in one day, and in the City of the
  <hi>Shechemits,</hi> and those thousands in the wildernesse, after the long
  cessation, both before and after circumcision? and yet that was such a tedious
  bloody, sore, and painfull piece of service, as required (no question) ten
  times more attendance with clothes and other accomplishments till it was whole,
  then this of baptism, even in that so troublesome way to you wherein we
  dispense it.</p>

  the Argument it self, for as if I should say <hi>immediately</hi> after the
  child was sprinkled the <hi>Gossips</hi> and friends went along with it home,
  it were absurd to understand me so, as if I meant that they did not stay so
  long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to wipe the childs face, and put the face cloathes over it, and
  lap it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the loose blanket to keep it warm: so no lesse absurdity is
  it to understand that speech, <hi>viz. And immediately the spirit caught away
  Philip, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> after <hi>Christ</hi> was baptized he went into
  the wildernesse, so strictly as if <pb n="382" facs="tcp:42067:196"/> there was not staying

  primitive custome, he tells you further p. 9. it was the Apostles way to
  baptize disciples as soon as they were become Converts the same day, rather
  sometimes the same houre, as we see in the</hi> Eunuch, <hi>the</hi> Jaylor,
  <hi>and</hi> Lydia, <hi>and multitudes of others; but conversion of Disciples
  necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happened when there was no season for dipping, the Element of
  water being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cold for that service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any object that in those Conntreyes there was no danger
  in the coldest times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He answers, the commission being for all Nations disciples
  were made in all Countreys; how soone saith he came the word to this Nation?
  &amp;c. sometimes therefore saith he the water and weather was too cold for
  dipping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, the Number of Converts were so numerous 3000,
  5000. in one day that there was no possibility of baptizing in that Manner,
  Acts 2. 41. and the 44.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Sometimes the Baptizers were in that condition that
  they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for that work in that way, as</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas
  <hi>men newly taken out of the stocks in the Inner Prison, with such stripes
  that their Convert was fain forthwith to wash them, in this case they were
  unfit to wade into the water for that work, and had they made any such
  adventure the Scripture would not have been si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, Sometimes the baptized have not been in case for
  dipping and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, which was</hi> Pauls <hi>case upon the Aparition of the
  vision he was lead into</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus, <hi>where he continues without meat or
  drink three daies, and upon</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias <hi>his comming in, and instructing
  of him he is baptized, and when he had received meat, saith the text, he was
  strengthned, will any believe he went out in this case with</hi> Ananias
  <hi>into the water, over head in water before the taking of any
  sustenance?</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Baptist.</head>
               <p>That persons were baptized as soon as ever they became Converts,
  and could be discerned to be disciples, even the same houre commonly without
  delay is an undeniable truth, for that and no other was the very period of time
  at which, what ever their parents were, they were deemed to have true title to
  baptism: for neither if their parents were wicked were such excluded as were,
  nor if the parents were godly, were such admitted as were not converted upon
  the Account of the fathers goodnesse or badnesse, but as they believed or not
  themselves, and this makes me the more amazed at it, that it is come to passe
  since that the faith of the father can now intitle the child to baptism, though
  the child have no faith at all of his own, and yet I muse more sith you all
  count infants, at least of believers, to be disciples from the womb, why yet
  you delay their baptism so long, and do it not at the <pb n="383" facs="tcp:42067:196"/>
  same houre of their birth: for whether they be <hi>Discipulinati,</hi> or
  <hi>discipuli facti</hi> if they be disciples (as you falsly suppose they are)
  if the primitive rule were to baptize persons as soon as ever they appeared to
  be disciples, then (unlesse you have any special instinct, whereby you know
  them to begin to be disciples, and in the faith, as many of you count them,
  about that very houre you baptize them in, and not before) you will appear to
  be a little tardy in your dispensations by your own rule, though in truth you
  are too hasty for all this.</p>
               <p>Now as to Mr. <hi>Blakes</hi> terrible conceit, concerning the
  coldnesse of the water, specially in some weather, when yet, if dipping were
  the way, there would by means of mens conversion, occasion be ministred to dip
  in, sith I see occasion will be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to discourse more of winter dipping,
  when I come to Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> grand Arguments, with one of which this is
  coincident, I shall say nothing to it here, but there speak to both under one,
  save only that I must here tell Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> that conversion of disciples
  necessarily happened when there was no season for dipping without danger, the
  <hi>Climate</hi> being, by reason of persecutions that rose against that way,
  much more over hot then the Element of water can at any time be over cold, for
  the owning of that service, must it therefore be forborn for fear of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
  our lives? if no exemption from a hotter service, why from a colder for the
  lifes sake? which whoever will save shall loose, but whoever will loose for
  Christs name sake, and the Gospels shall preserve it to life eternal: as for
  the rest under that head I fully agree with it <hi>viz.</hi> that whatever that
  is, there is commission but for one manner of baptism for all nations.</p>
               <p>As to the multitude of Converts three thousand, five thousand
  converted in one day, which shift word for word Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> covers his
  nakednesse with, adding thus much the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>eunto, <hi>viz.</hi> could <hi>Peter</hi> and those few with him
  the dispensers of this ordinance have stayed so long in the water, or by
  dipping every one dipped so many in so short a time?</p>
               <p>I answer how many and in how short a time does the man mean? as
  for the 5000 it is doubtful whether they were all converted in that one day, or
  whether he speaks not rather o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
  the whole multitude that believed before, which were 3000 together with those
  that afterward were added, which might be some 2000 and so 5000 in all; but if
  there were fully 5000 that then believed, and that they were all at the same
  time baptized too, which is not said, and tis more probable (for done it must
  be) that twas done at another time, or else by other hands then by
  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohns,</hi> for they were laid hold on in the Temple as
  they were speaking, but suppose I say that there be at any time full five
  thousand newly believing in so short a time as one day, if they could not be
  bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized all in one day they must necessarily, they might lawfully for ought I
  know stay till the next, but yet 3000 we read were baptized in one day, neither
  is it such an impossible thing as you, who stumble at every straw, are slugg'd
  by every rub, and look on duty with such difficulty, as if a Lyon were in the
  way, would seem to make it, for 5000 to be baptized in one day;</p>

               <p>Many hands of them that have love to Christ may both lessen, and
  lighten that service, and suffering that is sustained for him, and make but
  then some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, (and such I perceive it is to you tenderlings, that
  make provision for the flesh to fullfill it in the ease thereof, to dipp many,
  or be dipped your selves in cold water, or weather) possible, easie, and
  pleasant, and how many hands there might be at work at once at the dipping of
  the 3000 besides the hands of the 12. who as occasion was made use of others to
  dispense the ordinance, it being an inferiour work to their preaching, see
  <hi>Act.</hi> the 9. <hi>Act. 10. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. may be conjectured, when the
  number of disciples were a hundred and twenty, where if there were but forty
  dispensers, with what ease might they baptize a 100 a <pb n="384" facs="tcp:42067:197"/>
  piece, and do themselves no more wrong neither with abiding in the water, knee
  deep, or a little more for half an hour together, then he that stands deeper
  for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a day together, and washes many a hundred sheep, as I have known
  some do, and that not by plunging onely, but longer padling with each of them
  by farre then need be in onely dipping persons, and so letting them go again;
  besides when once 3000 were baptized, how many hands there were ready to
  baptize not 5000 onely, but 5 times 5000 if occasion were, and that quickly
  too, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any rational man that reckons it; for it is a work which
  when it is once ready to be done, is done in lesser time, then I have seen
  taken up by the Parish Priest in his dropping, and crossings, and other font
  fidlings about an infants face: and if you suppose it may ask so much hand for
  so many persons in so short a time as one day to make themselves ready for such
  a work, I hope the same time that serves one to undresse and dresse in, which
  may be some a quarter, or at most not above half an hour, may as easily serve
  ten thousand, for as if all set at once to sweep every one his own door, a
  whole City may be clensed in an instant, so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that is willing
  addressing himself to the work, a thousand may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as soon as one.</p>
               <p>And as for that other conceit of Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> which Mr.
  <hi>Simpson</hi> transcribes out of his book into his own letter in these words
  <hi>viz. that</hi> Paul <hi>when he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by</hi> Ananias <hi>was not
  in case by reason of his weaknesse to be plunged in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter over head and
  ears,</hi> as he was not by reason of his stripes to have gone in a deep river
  or pond, when he baptized the <hi>Iaylor,</hi> it is as wisdomlesse as any of
  the rest, for what if he were taken out of the stocks in the inner prison &amp;
  had such stripes that his convert was fain to wash them, was he therefore so
  unfit, or was it such a strange adventure (as Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> proclaimes it)
  to wade in the water for such a work as the dipping a few persons? could that
  water that toucht his legs while he waded, be more mischievous to him, then the
  water that washed the blood of his stripes? and when he was baptized himself,
  what though he had fasted three daies from food in that sudden extasie of his
  mind, which time its like he spent in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and prayer to the Lord, <hi>for
  behold he prayeth</hi> saith the text, yet I trow, as dainty of danger as our
  Clergy men are, that dare dip their fingers, but not their feet in cold water
  for Christ, that voluntary keeping under of his body did rather fit, then unfit
  him for burial with Christ in baptism, which his proud flesh would else not
  have stoopt to.</p>
               <p>Surely Sirs you are men that make so much of every little for
  Christs sake, that Crosses and diseases your flesh, that you will hardly ever
  commend your selves as the ministers of Christ did of old 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 5.

  are fain to flag so far in this case, as to confesse it, for not onely
  <hi>Tilenus</hi> reacheth us, that heretofore submer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was the way of
  baptizing, rather then aspersion, but Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> also furnishes us
  (as I have shewed above) with as much as we desire, and if it be once granted
  (as it is in a manner already by not a few, if not all but Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi>
  why else do they trouble themselves, and the world to render reasons why it
  might be by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersion in the primitive ages and places of baptizing, but not
  so now?) I know no reason worth a rush, on which we can be held excused from
  baptizing by submer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion as they did:</p>

            <div type="subpart">

               <p>
                  <hi>Tis true it is confest by some, and if it were granted by
  all that baptism was then by dipping it were not so material to your cause, nor
  would you get so much ground by it, sith both such as flatly agree to it, and
  such as see not cause to agree to it so fully as some do, are all agreed in the
  grand reason why it was so then, and why it may not be so now at any hand viz.
  the different temper of those climates, wherein baptism first began, and of
  ours, wherein it now is practised, theirs being so hot, that there could be no
  danger by dipping in the coldest times, ours so cold, that it cannot but be
  very dangerous, if not destructive to life and health.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I grant saith Dr.</hi> Featly <hi>that Christ and the Eunuch
  were baptized in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and that such baptism of men especially in
  the</hi> Hotter Climates <hi>hath been, is, and may lawfully be used, but the
  question is whether no other baptizing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? or whether dipping in
  Rivers be so necessary to baptism, that none are accounted baptized, but those
  that are dipped after such a manner?</hi> usitatior olim fuit <hi>&amp;c.
  submersion was more usual in</hi> Judea <hi>and other</hi> warmer Countreys
  <hi>saith</hi> Tilenus <hi>then aspersion, notwithstanding sith submersion may
  prove preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious to the health, specially of such tender infants, as for the
  most part are baptized now a dayes, we suppose the Church may use which she
  pleases, and saies Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>if it were otherwise in the primitive
  times, it would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but occasionall from a reason proper to those</hi>
  Hot Countreys; <hi>and saith Mr.</hi> Cook <hi>though it were granted that in
  those</hi> Hot Countreys <hi>they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly washed by going down into the
  water, and being dipped there, whether in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, or ceremonial, or
  sacramental washing, that will no moee inforce on us a necessity of observing
  the same in baptism now, then the example of Christ, and the Apostles gesture
  in the sacrament of the supper, ties us to the same; which was leaning, and
  partly lying, which was their usual table gesture then, now the ordinary table
  gesture which is usual among us, is most fit, so the usual manner of washing
  among us is most fit to be observed in baptism, and that is by powring as well
  as by dipping: so you see these men are all of a mind, that is was, or at least
  might be so possibly in the primitive times, but if it were, yet not so in
  ours, in regard of the coldnesse of our climate.</hi>

               <p>Then it seems we shall have it amongst you <hi>pro confesso</hi>
  that in the Apostles dayes the way was dipping, for though Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>

  plainly, and the Dr. drawes neerer to us then so, giving it for gone that in
  those <hi>Hot Countryes</hi> baptism in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers was then used, onely whether
  such manner of dipping in rivers be so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to baptism in all countreyes,
  <hi>this we say</hi> saies he <hi>is false,</hi> and so for ought I see you say

               <p>But Sirs first, I pray tell me from the very bottom of your
  consciences, whether <pb n="386" facs="tcp:42067:198"/> you can conceive that Christ hath
  appointed two sorts of baptism <hi>viz.</hi> one kind of baptism for
  <hi>Iudea,</hi> and those regions round about <hi>Iordan,</hi> and another for
  <hi>England, Scotland, France, Spain, Italy,</hi> and all the regions round
  about of the Romish Christendom? whether he hath ordained two baptisms, or
  rather two different dispensations, whereof one is not baptism, to be used in
  different places, <hi>viz.</hi> baptism for the <hi>Hot Countryes;</hi> and
  Rantism for the <hi>Cold?</hi> or whether he hath not rather wild one onely
  baptism, and that a true one, to be used through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, Dr
  <hi>Featley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> suppose the first, but
  where's Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> all this while their wonted <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>diutor</hi> in the cause? verily he
  leaves them a little here, and lends us his hand, who hold that Christ gave
  order, and commission for no more then one way of baptism in all Nations; for
  howbeit he finds in his heart to let Rantism passe for currant baptism among
  them that take the liberty to maintain, and use it for fear of cold p. 4. yet
  whatever way of baptism the commission was given out for in those <hi>Hotter
  Countryes,</hi> whether submer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or infusion, (for a spersion he ownes not
  to be it however) the very same way, and no other, he holds the commission to
  be for in the coldest Nations under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and this will appear if what he
  saies in his 9. p. be considered, where after he had used this argument to
  prove that total dipping was not the way of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive baptism
  <hi>viz.</hi> because the conversion of disciples, and so consequently their
  baptism hapned sometimes to be, when there was no season for dipping, the
  ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water being over cold for that service, he speaks thus in way of
  answer to an objection <hi>viz. if any object that in those</hi> Hotter
  Countryes <hi>there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the coldest times,</hi> I <hi>answer</hi>
  saith he,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Commission being for all nations, disciples were made in
  all Countries: how soon came the word to this nation?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In which words he is void of common sense that doth not discern
  Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> siding with us, saying that the way of baptism should be one
  in all ages, and places, and asserting quite contrary to his fellow disputers
  against dipping, so far as to confute them to our hands, for whereas they all
  <hi>uno ore</hi> with one consent cry out that the reason why they baptized by
  dipping in the primitive time was because <hi>Judea</hi> and the regions round
  about were <hi>Hot Countryes,</hi> but <hi>England</hi> is a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der climate,
  and therefore we need not baptize the same way as they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d: he Tells them plainly that the heat of those
  Countries could be no reason why they should use totall dipping then, more then
  other nations, because the commission for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing was one and the same, to
  all Nations, and disciples were then made in all Countryes, as well as in
  <hi>Iudea,</hi> in cold Countries as well as in hot, yea <hi>how soon</hi>
  saies he, <hi>came the word to England it self?</hi> baptism therefore in his
  account should be the same in <hi>England</hi> as in <hi>Iudea,</hi> not by
  dipping in <hi>Iudea</hi> more then in <hi>England</hi> because that was a
  <hi>hot Country</hi> and this a colder, but the commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a like in all
  places cold and hot, this is the sense those words of his sound forth, but if
  Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> were silent in this case, the Scripture speaks loud enough,
  that there is but one baptism for all Nations, and no Rantism ordained for any,
  for then the commission must include Christs willingnesse to dispense with
  colder cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in this point, and in our understandings at least run thus
  <hi>viz. go and teach all nations, baptizing them</hi> that live in hotter
  countryes, and rantizing them that live in colder climates; <hi>he that
  believeth, and is baptized,</hi> if he live in <hi>Iudea,</hi> or any
  <hi>Hot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  but rantized if he live in <hi>England,</hi> or any cold Countrey <hi>shall be
  saved,</hi> in which silly unsound sense to understand those Scriptures is to
  be silly indeed, and without either sense or understanding: and yet thus it may
  be understood if this be the reason why they in <hi>Iudea</hi> must be dipt,
  and we in <hi>England</hi> must be no more then sprinkled for fear of danger
  <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>Iudea</hi> was a warm Countrey, and <hi>England</hi>
  a cold one: for either <hi>Christ</hi> did ordain the thing to be done in this
  different manner in different regions, or he did not, if he did then it must be
  first some way or other intimated in the <pb n="385" facs="tcp:42067:198"/> commission, but
  there it is not, and secondly it must be done accordingly in this different
  manner in the execution, or else they are high transgressors that do but
  rantize in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and they high transgressors (and so Mr.
  <hi>Blake</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> say they are with a witnesse, but will
  never prove it) that baptize by total dipping in <hi>England;</hi> but if he
  did not ordain it to be done in such several waies in several Regions,
  according as they are hotter or colder, but in one way only in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
  then that one way is by baptizing, i. e. dipping onely, or else by rantizing
  onely; and if by baptizing onely, then they are high undertakers that take

               <p>Secondly, Sirs you grant so much as to say possibly, probably it

  consciences without stifling them, or shuffling with them, so as not to suffer
  them to speak, what constructions must be made of those Scriptures, which we

  that tell us of the baptism that was dispensed in those <hi>Hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi>
  as <hi>Iohn 3. 23. Act.</hi> 16. 13. 14. 15. 33. where it is said <hi>Iohn

                     </gap>ke the
  word,</hi> at which time <hi>Lidya</hi> and hers were baptized, and a while
  after the Jaylor and his, tell me I say what construction all these, and all
  the Scriptures that talk of baptism, as dispensed in those <hi>Hot
  Countryes,</hi> must consequently bear, if it be once granted that such total
  dipping was the manner of baptizing in the primitive times in those <hi>Hotter
  Countreys,</hi> must they not then needs have the senses we put upon them,
  <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ and the rest did really descend <hi>into</hi> the
  water, were buried <hi>under</hi> the water, and raised again, and not those
  forced sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, into which you would rest them to your own ends, <hi>viz.</hi>
  that they went but to the water, and there were wetted onely by sprinkling, or
  pouring, and from the water again without going into it, or being dipped in it?
  if you give us one for granted, <hi>viz.</hi> that in <hi>Iudaea</hi> and those
  <hi>Hot Countreyes,</hi> as <hi>Rome, Phillippi,</hi> and <hi>Collosse</hi> the
  manner of baptizing was by going down into the water, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dipped therein
  in this Sacramental washing, you must necessarily give up also all the interest
  that you claim in those Scriptures for sprinkling, they being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then
  the relation of what baptism was done in <hi>Iudea,</hi> and those <hi>Hot
  Coun-Countreys,</hi> and not what was done in cold; if then it be supposed that
  baptism by submersion, and not aspersion, was the custome in the Scripture
  times, it must semblably be supposed that the Scriptures themselves, that story
  out the baptism of those times do speak of that Manner of baptism that then
  was, and not of another, unlesse we suppose it must be interpreted as speaking
  of another thing, then that it only speaks of, and so consequently this
  Scripture, this Testament must be supposed to be wholly on our sides, and to
  speak only of mens baptism by submersion, and you must suppose out some New
  Testament of Christ, if you can tell where, for the exemplifying of your baby

                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:42067:199"/> where dipping is the Custome, as you
  happened to come out in such a cold <hi>Climate</hi> where for fear of cold,
  more then any thing else, that is to warrant such a pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ise, the custome is
  onely to sprinkle, I appeal to your own consciences, whether such a thing as
  rantizing would once have come into your minds upon the single search of those
  Scriptures?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas you talk of dipping as the way of baptizing in
  those <hi>Hot Countreyes,</hi> both Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>
  also p. 15. assert that <hi>In those</hi> Hot Countrys <hi>waters for dipping
  were scarce and rare, and could not be had in some places in a great
  distance,</hi> and therefore, if sprinkling or pouring only must be used in
  some <hi>Countreyes,</hi> and dipping in other some, in all reason and
  likelyhood, if any places may be exempted from dipping, sprinkling should be
  dispensed with rather in those <hi>Hot Countreyes</hi> to save people the
  paines of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling so far as they must do for dipping, where the waters were
  at such a distance from them, and dipping rather appointed to be used in these
  <hi>Countreyes,</hi> where the Service, as it is not much more tedious then it
  was in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> at least in cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and sharpest seasons, so may it
  be moderated as touching the tediousness ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by being done and dispatcht
  through the vicinity of waters here not very far off from our own doors.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, even those <hi>Hot Countryes</hi> of <hi>Iudaea,
  Rome,</hi> and the Regions ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about were not within the Torrid Zone, nor so
  hot, but that if cold water would have quenched love to Christ, and pretence of
  danger discharg'd from duty, they might have been as shy as your selves of
  being dipped in water, for even there the waters (saies Mr. <hi>Blake)</hi> was
  over cold for such a service, and also this <hi>Colder Countrey</hi> (as you
  count it) of <hi>England</hi> is under the Tepid Zone, and not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
  cold in summer Seasons, but that dipping may be as well digested then, as in
  <hi>Iudaea,</hi> or as it is by such as then washed themselves in way of
  plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Hot Countrey</hi> catch therefore is an Argument that
  flashes fairly in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n and
  makes a report with a powder, for almost every one lets fly at us out of this
  Engine, but verily it is an empty Engine, a piece discharged to keep <hi>Cold
  Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey</hi> Christians from killing themselves with Christs service, but
  charged with no great store of truth nor sense, nor reason: wherefore Sirs if
  the coldnesse of this service of total dipping do cause you to stand so coldly
  affected toward it as not to submit to it here in <hi>England,</hi> unlesse the
  <hi>Climate</hi> were a little hotter, yet at least let us, who by dipping as
  weak folks as your selves in winter have experienced how tollerable it is,
  through Christ strengthening us, for Christs sake to be with <hi>Paul</hi> in
  cold and perills of water, (so you suppose tis to be dipped) as well as in
  other hardship: Let us, I say, who are willing to venture on the way of
  dipping, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without your offence, and as for us we shall in order to your
  good be so far offended at your neglect of it, as uncessantly to call upon you
  and yours, to <hi>repent and be</hi> so <hi>baptized every one of you in the
  name of the Lord Iesus for the remission of sins,</hi> till you can shew us (as
  Iam sure you never will) his letters pattents for your Exemption.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But Mr.</hi> Cook <hi>forces this Argument further yet, and
  tells you that their custome of being dipped enforces us to the same, no more
  then the Gesture that Christ used at Supper binds us to the same, you are
  willing to overlook that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps having little or nothing to say to it, but I
  pray take all along with you as you go, and be not so par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Baptist.</head>
               <p>As for that poor piece of sustenance, that Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>
  affords beyond all the rest toward the further improvement of this exception
  which from the heat of those <hi>Countryes</hi> you make against the Example of
  dipping in the primitive times, it <pb n="389" facs="tcp:42067:199"/> hath no substance in
  it, whereupon your cause can possibly live, for though he saies their going
  into the water then, and being dipped therein no more inforces us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
  the same in baptism, then the Example of Christ, and his Apostles gesture in
  the Supper, which was leaning and partly lying, ties us to the same: but as the
  table Gesture of sitting now in use among us is fittest for the Supper, so the
  usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all way of washing, which is by powring as well as dipping is fittest to be
  ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in baptism.</p>
               <p>Yet I desire Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> to consider these things,</p>
               <p>First, that if the priesthood had but any such clear example of
  their being sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the primitive times, as we have of their going down
  into the water, and being dipt there, they would inforce us with more then
  Arguments to an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the very same, yea how hardly have we escaped
  being inforced by them from dipping, though they have not an inch of instance
  for their sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a vast difference between an example in point
  of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and meer gesture about a service, and the very substance of
  the service it self, variation from Christs example in the first is naught
  enough, but in the other worse then nothing; yet even such is your degeneration
  from dipping to sprinkling, from baptism to rantism <hi>viz.</hi> not a
  variation from some certain circumstance in that one matter of baptism, but a
  variation from the ordinanance it self, a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not what Christ did in
  another manner, but a doing of another matter then Christ did: dipping with the
  face upward, and with the face downward is the same thing still, though in a
  different gesture, and (to satisfie Mr. <hi>Simpson,</hi> who in his letter
  scarce thinks it a burial in baptism, if the face be not upward, and the water
  powred on, as the earth is on them, we burie with their faces upward) whether
  this way or that way is not so much material if there be a total covering and
  overwhelming with either earth or water, it is a true burial still
  notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; but dipping and sprinkling are two such diverse things, that
  the first is both baptism, and burial in baptism, but the second neither the
  one nor yet the other.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and yet the gesture is so far to be heeded in every
  ordinance, that if we know any one to be better then another, and more ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>redly to be that which Christ and his
  disciples used, I suppose we are bound, if not of necessity, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it
  to follow any other mens fashions whatsoever, and I believe Mr. <hi>Cook</hi>
  did think it worth contending for to exchange the <hi>Bishops</hi> kneeling at
  supper, for one more suitable to that Christ used.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the gesture Christ used was the same as ours i. e.
  sitting not leaning, nor yet lying, for though Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> asserts with
  such confidence that lying was used by Christ, tis undoubtedly utterly untrue:
  what ere was the usual table gesture then is nothing to the point, or if it be
  it is most evident it was sitting, as it is now, for if it was in some places
  the fashion to lean or ly on beds at great banquets (as some tell us) yet I am
  sure the table gesture was not lying nor lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither any otherwise then as
  we do <hi>viz.</hi> on one elbowor both when we please: the Scripture saies all
  along that he sate: Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> greeking it out in the margent as he does

               <p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:42067:200"/> Nor yet fiftly is the usuall manner of
  vvashing among us, which you confesse is most fit to be used in baptism, by
  povvring as vvell as dipping, for povvring is (and yet but in some cases onely,
  as namely the vvashing the hands, and in that very case but sometimes and
  seldome onely, for mostly that is by dipping, and this too, but when the
  infusion is so large as totally to vvash the hands so vvashed) a preparative to
  such a vvashing, but a compleat true washing it is not of it self, vvithout
  some subsequent act of rubbing, vvhich you use not about infants faces; but
  swilling in water is the most usual way of washing, and a washing of it self
  some times, and some times used without any after rubbing at all, therefore
  this by Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> own rule by right should be observed in baptism.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, whereas he argues from the custom of the present times
  to an exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the primitive customes and practise, he might as well
  take upon him to say thus, if any man contend for that faith, way of worship,
  way of baptism, that was in the primitive and purest times. and for a
  reformation of all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word; and example of the Churches
  the word speake of, it is true those Churches indeed worshipped thus, were
  congregated thus, ordered thus, baptized thus <hi>viz.</hi> by dipping when
  they believed, but sprinkling infants is the way, and fashion now adaies, and
  as for what was done of the Churches of old, we have nothing to do with it, and
  if any list to be contentions for it we have no such custom now, nor the
  Churches of God! of which sure Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> cannot but be ashamed, who
  hath covenanted to reforme according to the word fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ing so strictly as that sprinkling may
  not be used, nor yet sprinkling so as that dipping may not be used, nay rather
  its a meer ceremony, a prudentiall point, in which the Church may use her
  discretion so as to dispense it either way, as conveniency and charity may
  dispose her, and no lesse is very well observed by Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>p. 135.
  Christ saith he hath not appointed the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of water nor manner of washing,
  no more then he hath appointed in the Lords supper what quantity of bread and
  wine each must take, and as it would be but folly for any to think, that men
  must needs fill themselves with bread and wine, because it best signifies the
  fullnesse of Christ, so it is no better to say, that we must needs be washed
  all over, because it best signifies our burial with Christ, &amp;c. Christ
  told</hi> Peter <hi>that the washing of his feet was enough to clense all, a
  lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle may signisie as well as much, as a clod of earth doth in possession of

  been quoted, and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to before, though not so satisfactorily, but that they
  sway with me still, I am almost loath to repeat them, yet sith they be so among
  the other, I can hardly decline the mentioning them once more, by your leave,
  in answer to the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a little water doth not so fitly and
  perfectly represent as dipping and plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sith in the one the whole body is
  washed, in the other the face or head on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He saies first, that the Scripture no where requires the

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, that with as good reason one may plead thus, that
  at the supper it. <pb n="391" facs="tcp:42067:200"/> is most convenient that every
  Communicant should receive his belly full of bread and wine, and take as long
  as stomach, and head will hold, to signify the full refreshment of the soul
  with the body and blood of Christ, but who,</hi> saies he, <hi>would endure

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, These outward Elements of water, bread and wine are
  for speciall use, and to signify special things, so that, if there be the truth
  of things, the quantity is not to be respected further then is sufficient for
  its end, namely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the spiritual grace, and that it be neither so
  little as not to represent, nor so much as to take of the heart from the
  spirituall to the corporal thing: not the washing away the filth of the body in
  baptism, nor the glutting or satisfying of the natural Appetite in the Lords
  Supper is to be looked after, but the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refreshing of the Soul,
  which may well be represented by the sprinkling of a little water, eating and

  had you done, you would have seen how little accrues to your purpose out of
  that grant of mine, for I told you there and now tell you again, sith I see you
  so quick to catch at things by the halves, and slow to mind what in them makes
  against you, that howbeit it is not so material which way you baptize, so you
  baptize, yet if you Rantize onely, you vary not onely in a circumstance, but in
  the very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Ordinance, doing quite another matter then that you
  should do, and not the matter, i. e. Baptism, in another manner onely; for we
  will bear with that, as a thing neither here nor there, whether you baptize, i.
  e. wash a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by overwhelming or burying him in water in this gesture, or
  that, this form, or that, with his face up or down, yea be it by infusion of
  water on him, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersion, or putting him under it, which of the two is most
  proper, and easy, we weigh it not, so you see to it that you bury, and
  overwhelm him: for all this while you retain both the true outward sign, which
  is baptism, or burial under water in baptism, in its nature, and essentiall
  form, in its true Analogy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the spiritual things signified,
  which are primarily the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, and secondly
  our being washed from sin by his blood; but if once you fall from baptizing to
  rantizing, from submersion to aspersion, from dipping to dripping, from a
  totall covering to almost a totall keeping him from the water, you vary from
  the very thing that is required, not from one manner of <pb n="392" facs="tcp:42067:201"/>
  baptizing to another, but from baptizing to another matter: There fore Sirs
  when you talk of our being hot for a ceremony, if by the word <hi>Ceremony</hi>
  you mean some petty, trivial, immaterial meer circumstance in baptism, which
  may <hi>indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tèr aut adesse aut abesse sine baptismi

  but for a time, yet stands by positive command for that time, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is to
  stand, by no lesse then divine institution, nor know I any man, Church or
  Angell that can institute a Ceremony to be observed and imposed; and if by a
  Ceremony you mean thus, not the meer manner of baptizing, but the matter, even
  baptism it self, which of <gap reason="foreign">

  those of the old covenant <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1. lasted only till his first
  appearing, then I confesse we are somewhat stiff for the ceremony, nor can you
  blame us if you consider what we do, for in so doing we contend for no lesse
  then substance, as far as you can call any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Christ so that hath a
  tendency, as a sign or otherwise, unto something yet more substantial; the rite
  of Circumcision, the Passeover, and all the other Sacrifices of the Law, though
  shadowes in comparison of what they pointed at, yet were ordinances so
  substantial, as instituted of God, and so strictly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that who so
  should have taken upon him to alter, and shape them more to the model of his
  own mind, would have heard as ill from God for it as, without his leave, for
  omitting them altogether, &amp; how ill that is he cannot be ignorant, that
  hears how sharply he speaks to them, that were too short but in tiths and
  offerings when in force, saying that a curse had therfore devoured their
  blessings <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. and also that neglected circumcision, saying every
  soul that is not circumcis'd, meaning of whom circumcision is required (but it
  was not of females then any more then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is of infants now) shall be cut
  off from among his people, and I appeal to your own consciencies if any should
  have said, circumcision is a painful, a tedious, and dangerous piece of
  service, and dispensation to little infants (and so it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed much more
  then dipping in cold water) and thereupon in charity circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion being
  nothing, and uncircumcision nothing, but a new creature, we will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pare
  there nailes, and make that serve instead of the other, would the Lord have
  took it better at their hands? would either God or good men have held them
  guiltlesse, yet whether they had circumcised thus or thus <hi>viz.</hi> with a
  knife, a sharp stone, or a pair of shears, I suppose that circumcision had been
  dispenst with, and even thus may we say of baptism as nothing as it is, it
  being an ordinance of Gods institution, both they that omit it to whom it is
  commanded, and they that in charity take upon them to alter it, so as to make
  Rantism serve instead of it, preaching or practising no baptism at all, or
  another thing that is no baptism un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of it, were it the Apostles

  you blame us therefore if we contend for the right bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism? for it is not
  another manner of the thing then you use, but the very thing it self we plead
  against you, who cannot be said to alter the right way of baptizing, but the
  rite of baptism it self; it is not a bare circumstance in the ceremony we
  differ in, but we differ in the substance i. e. in the ceremony, or rite it
  self, which you have changed, having no parts at all of the rite in your wrong

               </p>
               <p>I know necessity and charity do dispense with circumstances in

  unbaptized in such a case, but no man may dispense another thing to him i. e.
  Rantism in its room and stead, no more then he may give other things then bread
  and wine in the supper, to a stomach too weak to bear either of those, for that
  is to take upon him to make another institution, and Gods leave man never had
  so to do.</p>
               <p>Secondly it must be by leave from the Lord implicit or expresse,
  upon which onely we can ground the lawfulnesse of omission, and necessity, and
  charity, but not charity mistaken, are leave enough no doubt to let a lone,
  though in no wise to alter what ever he ordaines, as when it neither can be at
  all, nor can be done conveniently, nor possibly without killing men indeed;
  whereupon we find no fault found with Israel in the wildernesse for forbearing
  to circumcise 40 years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it is like least it should hinder them in
  their warfare, but sure I am they should have heard of it from the Lord if to

  chuse but see word enough for our use of sprinkling, though dipping were used
  never so in the primitive times, for they tell you (but me thinks you do not

  appoints not the measure of water nor manner of washing, more then the measure
  of bread and wine in the Supper, he hath left it</hi> ad libitum, <hi>and as

  think that men must eat in the Supper as long as head and stomach will hold,
  because it signifyes the souls refreshment, so that in baytism we must be
  washed all over, because it best signifies our burial with Christ: a little
  signifies as well as much, a clod of earth, a pepper corn, a little skin cut
  off in circumcision, so by a little bread and wine eat and drank, and by a

               <p>That which best signifyes is best to be done, and forasmuch as

                  </gap> at best signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that both
  signifies and resembles the quantity of the Element, that manner of action
  which best resembles is best and fittest to be used undoubtedly in baptism, in
  which Christ hath undoubtedly appointed what is best, whereupon if Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> grant (or if he do not he cannot deny) that overwhelming best
  resembles, and consequently best signifyes our burial with Christ, he never
  will give good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whilest he breathes upon this earth, why washing all
  over (as he calls it) should not be used; as for that reason that is given
  against it here by himself at second hand, and by Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> at first,
  of whom he borrowes well nigh every bit of what he saies against a totall
  dipping, save only his fearful, fairfowl flourishes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First that the measure of water, and manner of washing the
  whole body is not appointed,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, That then in the Supper there must be a eating to
  the full,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, That a little may serve as well as much,</hi>
  theres little weight as far as I see in any part of it.</p>
               <p>The first hath so little reason, that it hath no truth in it for
  Christ hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vertually in some measure the measure of water in that
  his very appointment of the manner of washing in the way of a totall
  overwhelming, as appears before in the signification of the word
  <hi>Baptize,</hi> which signifies a dipping or overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that subject,
  that is particularly denominated to be washed by it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the whole
  man, or but a part of him; if the tip of the finger only be said truly to be
  baptized, then that tip must be totally washed; if the hands be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated,
  without a figure to be baptized, then the hands at least are total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly washed;
  if the man be the subject properly predicated to be baptized, then that man
  also must be totally washed; but in Scripture the man is required, and
  ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be baptized; to the performance of which such a measure of water
  is consequently appointed, as may be at least sufficient for that end, and
  required it is that it be neither so little that it cannot totally wash him,
  nor yet so much as must necessarily drowne him, as an ocean would, but a
  proportion suitable to that purpose.</p>
               <p>To the second I might answer, that there is not altogether the
  same reason, for such a totall filling, and swilling in the Supper, as there is
  for a totall swilling in baptism; sith the main and radical matter, that is to
  be resembled in baptism is Christs death, burial and resurrection, but the
  radical thing, that is resembled in that action of our eating and drinking in
  the Supper, is our faith, whereby we feed upon Christ, and accept him each to
  our selves as our Redeemer, without <pb n="395" facs="tcp:42067:202"/> which that he is a
  Redeemer will do us no good, for faith is the appropriating of of Christ the
  bread of life, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ch to our selves,
  who is set before us in common in the whole loaf, and as it will do a man no
  good to have bread and wine before him, which are elements most refreshing,
  unless he take them, and eat and drink, so neither us to see a Saviour set
  before us, unlesse we take of his salvation to our selves.</p>
               <p>This is that which is most immediately signifyed, and
  particularly represented in the Supper, which businesse of bare taking Christ
  Jesus to our selves by faith, is represented truly in taking never so little,
  but a burial and resurrection not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n never so little water; a few crumbs of bread and sips of wine
  taken do reptesent a taking of Christ in the Supper, but not so a few drops of
  water tisfled upon the face Christs death, buriall and resurrection: and sith
  you say the refreshment of the soul by the fullnesse is represented in our
  eating and drinking in the Supper, and yet that eating and drinking a little
  bread and wine not to fulness is enough in the supper to represent that, and so
  why not a little water, not deep enough to dip and bury in, applyed to us in
  baptism, the burial and resurrection of Christ?</p>
               <p>I might answer that the refreshment of the soul by Christ is
  represented rather in the elements, then in the action of either, eating or
  drinking in the supper, by the bread which is a strengthner of mans heart, and
  wine which is for them of a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful heart, and therefore there might not be
  altogether the need of representing our r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>freshing by eating and drinking much, at least so much
  as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> talkes of, viz. to the filling and
  glutting of our selves to the top as long as head and stomack will hold, that
  action would yield but a small resemblance of a refreshment, and were enough to
  make a sound man sick, but there is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in all things, and a difference
  as we say between staring, and stark mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> thus I say I might answer, and cut off your arguing for analogy,
  and a small portion of the element in baptism, as well as in the supper,
  between which there is not fully the same reason.</p>
               <p>But verily I am of your mind that a refreshment of the soul by
  the fulnesse of Christ is very fit to be resembled and represented by the
  quantity of the elements, as well as by the elements in the supper also; and
  yet am I not of your mind that so little, as you ordinarily use, is so very fit
  as you dream it is to represent it, but of the mind rather that as you are in
  your baptism <hi>viz.</hi> not out of your ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as you should be if you
  were baptized in truth by submersion, or putting clear under water, but out in
  your element rather i. e. in the measure of your wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is not adaequate
  to the true manner of washing, so you are also in the supper too poor in your
  provision of elements, for that which is the true and full purport of that
  sacred service; you have got together many littles to prove that so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
  element as you use both in baptism and supper may do as well, if not better,
  then more, all which are very little to the purpose, <hi>a little may signifie
  as well as much</hi> saies Mr. <hi>Baxter, a clod of earth, a pepper corn:</hi>
  but what then? we are to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie with resemblance, or else a sacrament is no
  sacrament, saith <hi>Austin,</hi> but saies Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> a little may
  resemble the washing, and the refreshing of the soul may well be resembled by a
  sprinkling of a little water, eating and drinking a little bread and wine, in
  circumcision a little skinne was cut off; what then?</p>
               <p>First it was as much as God required to be cut off.</p>
               <p>Secondly it was so much as made it circumcision.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as much as truly and clearly resembled the circumcision
  of the heart, which is signified, but such is not (for all Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi>
  conceit) that little water you sprinkle, nor yet that little becad and wine you
  distribute, it is neither so much as represents clearly the things signified,
  which are not onely the clearing of the soul by Christs dainties in the supper,
  which should be resembled by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, but some more chearing
  and refreshing of the body, then that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in your
  communions;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:42067:203"/> But alas the burial and resurrection of
  Christ, in baptism should be resembled by submersion, and emersion; and
  therefore to answer Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> in the words of Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> the
  outward elements of water bread and wine are for spirri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual use, and to
  signifie spiritual things, so that if there be the truth of things [but what I
  wonder if there be not (as I am sure in Rantism there is not) the truth of
  baptism] the quantity is not to be respected further then is sufficient for its
  end, namely to represent the spiritual grace [so far then it seemes it must be,
  and that is enough to confute Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> Rantism, for it represents not
  the spiritual grace] and that it be neither so little as not clearly to
  represent it [yet so little is the quantity that you use, not of water onely in
  the one, but of bread and wine also in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinarily] nor so much as to
  take off the heart from the spiritual to the corporal thing] content with all
  in my heart that it be not too much on this hand, provided that it be not too
  litle one the other, so but that it may reach to resemble the things signified,
  for the whole vertue of baptism lying in signification <hi>per ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionem i.e.
  per submersionem, per sepelitionem in aquâ,</hi> and the vertue of the

               <p>To conclude Sirs you are too short in that point of the outward
  element in the supper as well as baptilm, in the Church of Corinth there was so

  these should have been, so the latter could not have been, but that the use
  then was to have more abundance of the elements, then you have in your parish
  passeovers, wherein the people are past over with so poor a pittance, that all
  may in likelihood be hungry enough, but none at all very easily drunken, such
  niggardly ships and sups; not at <hi>Rome</hi> onely, where the Priests
  expounding Christ as speaking to themselves, when of the wine, saying <hi>drink
  ye all this,</hi> and not to the people, saying <hi>drink ye all of this,</hi>
  do impropriate the liquor wholly to themselves, but in <hi>England</hi> also do

  us a touch here too through the persons of a popish par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty p. 10. <hi>of Peters

  Iohn</hi> 13. 9. 10. is as sufficient as the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the whole.</p>
               <p>As if that Scripture even therefore because it speaks of
  washing, doth speak of this ordinance of baptism: either it doth Sirs in your
  opinion or it doth not, if not, to what purpose do you quibble upon it here? if
  you say it doth, I much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel why youthink so, but more if in earnest you
  argue from it that a man need be baptized but in part onely, sith you all
  confesse practically that the face and head, but not the feet are the subject
  of baptism. yea verily you had as good have said <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> took water
  and washed his hands before the multitude, therefore the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of baptism
  is no total dipping, for the story of Christs washing <hi>Peters</hi> feet
  speaks no more of the ordinance of baptism, then the other does; yea it is most
  e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that the washing of the disciples feet was clear to another end and
  use <hi>viz.</hi> not to baptize them, much lesse to shew how they should
  baptize others, but meerly to teach them humility one toward another, and to
  condescend to the lowest offices that could be for loves sake to each other;
  this Christ expressed himself to be the direct meaning of what he did, v. 12.
  13. 14. 15. &amp;c. after he had washed their feet he saies to them: <hi>know
  you what I have done to you? you call me Lord and master, you say well, so I
  am; if I your Lord and Master have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one
  anothers feet, for I have given you an example that ye <pb n="397" facs="tcp:42067:203"/>
  should do as I have done unto you,</hi> this was Christs end therefore to learn
  them hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, which was done as well in washing their feet onely, as all the
  body, yea the feet only indeed, because the feet are the viler parts of the
  body, for us to stoop to wash, whereby to expresse our humility each to other,
  in which respect and no other it is that when <hi>Peter</hi> yet ignorant of
  what Christ was about to do, cryed out <hi>Lord my hands also and my head,</hi>
  Christ replies, <hi>that he that is washed, i. e.</hi> not in Baptism, but in
  this washing he was then about <hi>need not more</hi> i. e. ad rem substratam
  <hi>then to wash his feet, but is clean e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very whit, i. e.</hi> as much as he
  need be to this intent, for which I now am wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you: besides that the
  washing of the feet only is not a sufficient washing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate a man
  baptized according to Christs ordinance, is evident by the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, that went
  into the water, and so was washed in his feet, and yet not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized for all
  that according to Christs will, till <hi>Philip</hi> had baptiz'd or dipt him
  there: it is a sign you are put hard to your shifts, when you use such

  that in Cities like</hi> London, <hi>and amongst Gentlewomen, that have been
  tenderly brought up, and Antient people, and weak people, and shop keepers,

  Mr.</hi> T. <hi>can clear out of his reading Antiquity what Church had such a

  some say they may stay till the heat of summer, when the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be

               <p>
                  <hi>But some desperately conclude that if it be Gods way, he
  will save our lives, how probable soever the danger may seem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I answer, saith he, that this is to begg the question, nay I
  have shewed, and am shewing that it is not Gods way; God hath appointed no
  ordinances contrary to his great morall commands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God must not be tempted, this was the devils trick
  to have drawn Christ under pretence of Scripture, and trusting God to have cast
  himself into danger of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>So you might have said to the disciples, that if it

  a greater duty it is at that time a sin, for it is alwaies a sin to prefer a

  naturall duty, and baptizing is but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive &amp;c. God hath not appointed

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So that I conclude saith Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>if Murder be a
  sin then d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ing over head in cold

                  <hi>Thus you see what opinion these men are of concerning your

  make so light of it, and wash it over as well as they can, yet Mr.</hi> Baxter
  <hi>wipes of all their varnish, and represents it in its proper colour to the

  such a cooling card as may soon make men repent of the baptism of repentance,
  unlesse they run home quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or be brought to bed before the people [as if

  as it is, any more then circumcision, that was a farre more bloody businesse,
  were it strictly injoined to be dispensed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants as that was, and as this
  is to believers at riper years: as for all the paines Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
  bestows against it, Improving Mr. <hi>Cooks</hi> argument with all his might,
  it is all meer babble and bawbling, he tells us it is a desperate conclusion,
  and a vile answer to say that if it be Gods way hee'l save our lives, how

               <p>I answer, for my part I beg no question of him, for I have
  proved the question already, and can prove to his face that dipping is Gods
  way, and will not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him to grant it, and being so if this be to
  be vile and desperate, to conclude that God will save our lives in his own way,
  Ile be more vile and desperate yet, and conclude with the three worthies, that

  have sustained them without, if it were a duty, yet when it is inconsistent
  with a greater duty, it is at that time a sin, for it is alwayes a sin to
  prefer a lesse duty before a greater, but the duty of self preservation is a
  natural, moral duty, and baptizing but posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>As if circumcision were not as contrary to the duty of
  self-preservation as dipping in water, as if the Priests profaning the sabbath
  by servile work, were not as conadictory to the moral command (as your very
  selves call it) of Sabbath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, as either of those to
  self-preservation, and yet when all is done all these were to be done, and none
  of these contradictory to the other neither, for in very deed God never
  commanded sabbath-observations so strictly, as that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the dayly
  sacrifice should be neglected, yea and the life not onely haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded, but
  utterly lost, and laid down for Christs name sake and the Gospels; he tells us
  that the duty of self-preservation is a moral natural duty, and baptizing but
  positive, I tell him again he saies as much in that, as I desire he should say,
  to the confirming of our tenet, for if baptizing be a positive duty, so far as
  tis posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive it must take place against the other, a positive command being to
  be obeyed rather then self to be favoured in any wise, in any case whatsoever:
  God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a positive command to slay his son, therefore that
  being positive, and the favouring and sparing of himself and his son, though
  moral and natural, yet but suppositive, i. e. to be lookt at so far onely as
  God lent him leave to injoy his son, it must be done, and the other let alone,
  God must be trusted, and his will obeyed, and the saving of his son must give
  way to the slaying of him: the positive duty of killing him being the greater,
  and to be preferred before the other, and the sparing him being inconsistent
  with this, though elsewise a duty, yet would have been at that time a sin. In
  that therefore he yields baptism to be a positive command, as if
  self-preservation were not so, he yields us more then we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take
  of him, for how beit for the most part it is positive, and therefore, so far as
  such, to be observed, without respect to the ill consequences of it to the
  lifeward, yet verily I question my self, though I find no expresse exemption
  from baptism in any case, whether there be not (yea it is certain there are)
  some cases, wherein the forbearance of the dispensation may, yea and must be
  dispenst with, but those a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  the coldnesse of the water and weather, but the utter impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the
  persons submitting to it, of whom else it is required, or his being bard from
  it, either as the thief on the crosse was, or by imprisonment, or by some such
  absolute sicknesse or weaknesse as confines persons necessarily to their beds,
  and puts them out of capacity and ability to betake themselves, where it may be
  done as it ought, I am willing to modify Mr. <hi>Baxters.</hi> rigid epithere
  of a positive command, whereby he denominates baptism, so far as to spare
  persons in these cases and respects, and to stile baptism a duty but
  suppositive i. e. a thing that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily must be done, if either possibly,
  or conveniently it may be done; but if it cannot, may be let alone: but this
  proves not that self-preservation must be alwaies prefer'd before baptism, for
  then it need never be obeyed at all, there being no time, wherein it can be
  done with so little seeming tediousnesse, and disease to a mans self, but that
  self will willingly excuse it self from obeying it, by pleading the duty of
  self-preservation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:42067:206"/> This duty of self-preservation hath
  couzened as honest a man as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ere now; and it couzens the

  be served, then self may be preserved, hence no pay no preach, no countenance
  from the magistracy, no continuance in their ministry, but for selfs sake they
  turn still with the times, but no faster; as if they durst trust God no further
  then they see him, and this was the plea, whereby <hi>Peter</hi> would fain
  have put Christ beside a duty that he foresaw would be dangerous, for Christ
  and himself too: but Christ gave him no great thanks for his labor, <hi>far be

               <p>He tattles to us <hi>that God must not be tempted, and that it
  was the divels trick to draw Christ under pretence of Scripture and trusting of
  God to have cast himself into danger of death,</hi> who doubts of all this, but
  is it tempting to perform a positive command of God, and expose our selves to
  danger and difficulty in the discharge of our positive duty to him, because it
  is so to indanger our liues by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, which we have no call to, nor
  warrand for, and which is absolutely sin, and hath not the least dram of duty
  in it at all? it is true it would have been but pretence of Scripture, and
  trusting of God in Christs casting himself from the pinacle of the Temple, but
  dare he saie there is but pretence of Scripture and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of God in
  submitting to his own ordinance of baptism? is there no more word to warrant us
  to be baptized, and to trust in God, and to expect his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in the
  execution of that so absolute a command, then there is to warrand the execution
  of our selves, which God universally forbids, and that on no more ground then
  the bare bidding of the devil? who would think a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister should be so moped
  as to make these two alike warrantable? it was the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels trick therefore to
  draw Christ under pretence of Scripture and trusting of God to self-execution
  against duty; and whether it be Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> trick onely, or the divels
  in him to draw men under pretence of Scripture and tempting of God to
  self-preservation so far as not to trust God in the discharge of duty, is not

  of flesh it is so sure that it needs no examination.</p>
               <p>If therefore it were indeed so dangerous to be dipt, as is

  all this, especially when they shall find their so much believed Mr.

  truth.</p>
               <p>Hear therefore o ye doters on <hi>Mr. Baxters</hi> deep
  divinity; he talks (if you will believe him) as if it were little lesse then
  impossible that persons should be dipped in cold weather in cold water, and not
  be killed suddenly by hundreds and by thousands, or at least not be cast into
  some Chronical disease, which within a while must be an occasion of their
  death; whereas there are hundreds if not thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands alive at this hour even in
  this cold Countrey, as they call it, many if not most of which have past
  through that sharp service in the sharpest seasons, conversion falling out as
  ordinarily in winter as in summer, whose present health both proves the
  falsnesse, and reproves the madnesse of your prophet.</p>
               <p>Yea I have cause to know a little better then every one, and a
  little more then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in this, <hi>Expertus loquor,</hi> I speak
  by experience, against which no Argument of his availes, I have seen since my
  five or six years converse among the commonly called Anabaptists many a one
  baptized totally in cold water and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too by others, besides toward two
  hundred by my silly self, many of which have come forth covered, though not
  with yee, as Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> phrases it out, yet with that water which yee
  truly covered but just before, yet never saw I any one so bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in all that
  time, who was not, if not better in meer bodily respects, yet at least as well
  after it as before; he tells you (if you will believe him) that totall dipping
  is <hi>for nothing but to dispatch men out of the world that are
  burdensome,</hi> but then I wonder how the Creature called Anabaptist, that is
  so burthensome to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> doth not dy out of the way by hundreds
  and thousands, and so save him and others that labour of dispute against their
  growth, but rather grow from hundreds into thousands so fast that they are not
  likely to be dispatcht out of the world, till they are such a burthensom stone
  as will press them to death, i.e. the whole Priesthood, that is troubled with
  them.</p>
               <p>He tells you (if you will believe him) that dipping will destroy
  men <hi>except they be preserved by Miracles,</hi> why else doth he say
  (speaking specially as to this ordinance of dipping) God hath not appointed
  ordinances in his Church that will destroy men except they be preserved by
  miracles; now if it be not so as hee sales <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a miracle
  to be dipped and not destroyed, then what a strange man is he to say so? but if

               <p>Yea whereas Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> dares say that in Cities like

  and antient people, and weak <pb n="404" facs="tcp:42067:207"/> people, and shopkeepers,
  especially women that take but little of the cold aire, dipping in cold weather
  would in the course of nature kill hundreds and thousands suddenly, or cast
  them into some Chronical disease, I dare say that in the City of
  <hi>London</hi> there is hundreds, if not thousands dipped in cold water, and
  as it happens, in cold weather too, many of which are Gentlewomen tenderly
  brought up, and antient and weak people, and shop keepers, and women that take

  them, if my memory fail me not, and if I were truly informed, was but once out
  of her house in 5 year before, by reason of a dropsy; and that was with much
  adoe, and but a little before her dipping, and to hear this doctrine,
  notwithstanding which weaknesse, and such swellings that she was wellnigh twice

  better after it (through Gods mercy) for a pretty while so as to go abroad:
  though she now is weak, and much what as she used to be before.</p>
               <p>If then you will not believe the words of God, believe the

  many Miracles among the men you nickname Anabaptists of late, for they are
  constantly preserved from perishing by either cold, or suffocation: yea I have
  known many a one better in body, but I nere knew any one, of whom I could
  safely say they were the worse in body or Soul for being dipt, save such as
  turned from the truth after turning to it, for the latter end with such indeed
  is worse then their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Yet how rashly do these men shoot their bolts to the murdering
  of the truth, whilst they make the ordinary practise of it no lesse then flat
  murder it self, and that undeniably to any understanding man, unless there be a
  preservation by a miracle; for else it <hi>destroyes men</hi> quoth Mr.
  <hi>Baxter, it directly tendeth to overthrow mens lives in the course of
  Nature, it will kill hundreds and thousands of them; but if a man scape
  perishing with cold, yet how can he</hi> (i.e. how is it possible for him)
  <hi>to escape being choaked</hi> quoth Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and stifled with the

               <p n="2">2. Secondly kept under water to signify his burial?</p>
               <p>How can a man escape choaking Sirs, if he be put and kept under

  then he can, and so Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> is confuted; if he cannot in the course
  of nature, without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, then it being certain that thousands do scape
  choaking, it should seem God by Miracle secures them, and yet for all this nor
  Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> are convinced; whether it be the
  more shame for them or no not to be so, I leave it to themselves, and all
  understanding men to consider.</p>
               <p>Or perhaps Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> means how can a man escape choaking
  if he be kept three daies under water, for so quoth he the disciple must, as
  Christ abode three daies <pb n="405" facs="tcp:42067:207"/> under water, if Christs burial
  be represented, but not onely his own party, for <hi>mora sub aqua

  this, for as the Ministers hand with which Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> resembles
  Christs burial is not dipt three daies together under water, so the infusion of

                  <hi>If there be not such danger of death to the Baptized, yet
  the Baptizers may be murderers of themselves, for it is evident that if the
  Minister must go into the water with the party, it will certainly tend to his
  death (saies Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>p. 137) though they may scape that go in but
  once, for weak Students to make a frequent practise of going into the water, it
  will cure their ich after novelties, and allay the heat of their intemperate

               <p>Me thinks so too, or else they are not like their wonted selves,

               <p>But I pray Sirs how certainly will it tend to your Ministers

                  <hi>Well, if it do not prove to be murder, and so against the
  eighth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet I am sure it will prove to be adultery to dip naked,
  as they say you do, and so flatly against the seventh, for either you dip naked
  or you do not, if you do not, then you cannot dip the whole body: but if you
  do, if that be not so shame fully sinful as is scarce fit to be named among
  Christians, I know not what is: and this Mr.</hi> Cook <hi>and</hi> Mr. Baxter

  <hi>whether the parties to be doused and dipped may be baptized in a garment,
  or no? if they may, then happily the garment may keep the water from some part
  of the body, and then they are not rightly

  they must be dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again, I would ask what warrand they have for dipping, or
  baptizing gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more then the Papists have for baptizing bells? therefore
  belike the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty must be naked, and multitudes present, as at</hi> Johns
  <hi>baptism, and the parties men and women at ripe years, being able to make
  confession of their faith and repentance; yet though they both sin against the
  sixth commandement indange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life, and against all common honesty and
  civility, and Christian modesty required in the seventh commandement, they must
  have this way observed, because they fancy it the onely baptism: shall we think
  saith he, this was the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism of</hi> John, <hi>Christ and his Apostles? thus
  he,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And saies Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>Another wickednesse in their
  manner of baptizing is their dipping persons naked, as is very usuall with many
  of them, or next to naked, which is usuall with the modestest that I have heard
  of, against which I argue thus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it be a breach of the seventh commandement, thou shalt
  not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, ordinarily to baptize the naked, then it is intollerable
  wickednesse, and not Gods ordinance, but so it is, therefore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Minor is thus evident</hi> saith he, <hi>that
  commandement forbids all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to uncleannesse, and all immodest
  actions, but to baptize women naked is an immodest action, and an incitement to
  uncleanness therefore, and to this he saies Mr.</hi> Tombes <hi>answered it was
  thought no immodesty in former times; but though it may seem no immodesty in
  Countries where they still go naked, yet among such as are not savages me
  thinks it should saith Mr.</hi> Baxter; <hi>if Mr.</hi> T. <hi>could baptize
  naked all the Maids in</hi> Bewdly, <hi>and think it no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modesty, he hath
  lost his common ingenuity, and modesty with the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, every good man is to watch over his heart, and to
  pray that he be not led into temptation, and would it be no snare and
  temptation to Mr.</hi> T. <hi>to be frequently imployed in baptizing maids
  naked? me thinks the very mention of it saith he, could I avoid it is immodest,
  and what it may be to all sorts of specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors I stand not to
  expresse;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Besides all this</hi> saith he, <hi>it is likely to raise
  jealousies in Ministers wives and others, and so to foment continual
  dissentions, and it will make the ministry a scandal, and make the people look
  on them as so many vile incontinent men, if <pb n="407" facs="tcp:42067:208"/> auricular
  confession brought that infamy, no wonder if ordinary baptizing naked do
  it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further, it would debauch the people, and bereave them
  generally of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon modesty, if once it growes into custom to behold each
  others nakednesse, and sure that practise is not of God, which so directly
  tends to bereave men of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civility, modesty, ingenuity and
  humanity:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover, it would make the worship of God ridiculous, would
  not vain young men come to a baptizing to see the nakednesse of maids, and make
  a meer jest and sport of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover the practise of baptizing naked would bring a
  general reproch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Christian profession among the enemies of it, and
  discredit the truth, for when Christians have the repute of Adamites, who will
  turn Christians? so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men will be loath to take a woman to wife that hath the
  impudency to shew her self naked to an assembly, and would esteem it next to
  taking one from the stewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If they shall say to all this, as Mr.</hi> Tombes <hi>said
  in his Sermon, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary they be naked, I reply</hi> saith he,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First if it be next to naked the difference is not great,
  and the former inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences will follow, and God would not have the Iewes go
  up by steps on his altar, lest their nakednesse be discovered thereon,</hi> Cam
  <hi>was curst for beholding his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nakedness, Christ tells us it is
  adultery to look on a woman to lust after her; the Scripture forbids
  filthiness, and uncleannesse, as not to be named among Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, such as would have them wholly, or mostly covered
  differ from their partners, and to dip them covered will overthrow their own
  arguments, for the necessity of washing the whole body, for this will be no
  washing but a soak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or steeping, if they stay in long enough, it may wash
  the garment, but the body will be but infused in all likelihood, and so I leave
  this unsavory practise, which were it not necessary to confute I should not
  meddle with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in these last cases we dispute not against bare words,
  but against experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and known practises, for their naked baptizing is a
  known thing, and the wickednesse that hath followed on some, and that some have
  died on't, and I would saith he, have others more wise, and escape both
  dangers, onely let me say saith he, thus much more that it is very suspicious,
  and to me unsavory that Mr.</hi> T. <hi>should say no more, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> that it is not necessary they should
  be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed naked, and in cold water, as if he took it to be lawful, but not
  necessary: me thinks he should rather have given his testimony against it, as
  sinful, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed some dislike, if he
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e do indeed dislike it, and judge
  it sinful, and if he do not, I dare say he is very far gone: one may see what
  you are by the words of these men, who have here set you out in your colours,
  so that I hope all, that read or hear what they say, will rather abhor then
  adore your dipping doings, and if you were not a people past all shame and
  sense of sin, me thinks you should abhorre your selves in dust and ashes, at
  the remembrance of your abhominable baseness in this particular; yea give me
  leave to say one word more to you, who were a minister once that did baptize
  infants, and it is the words of Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>to Mr.</hi> Tombes p. 255.
  <hi>I conjecture that by that time you have baptized half as many maids and
  women naked in a cold River, as you have baptiz'd infants like an officiating
  Priest, your feet will either take cold, or your heart will take heat: if you
  would be ruled by me you should not indeavour to introduce into the Church a
  custome for every young minister or neighbour, so much as to look on a
  bathing</hi> Bathsheba <hi>or</hi> Susanna, <hi>least to those without, the
  name of a Church and a stewes, a Presbyter and a Pander, a Christian and a
  fornicator, do prove Synonimaes.</hi>

               <p>To those without? I wonder who those are? those without your
  Church must be out of the Nation too for ought I know, and cannot well see what
  is done by you in it: but to let that passe.</p>
               <p>Here is thunder enough, but no lightning, a shrill sound but an
  empty barrel; such is Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> book indeed, specially this twofold
  fardle about murder and adultery, in which whether there be more noise or
  non-sense I know not, but sure I am there is ten times more twittle-com-twattle
  then truth: this doctrine would make a terrible tumbling in a Country Church as
  they say, and make all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amazed to hear what manner of men these
  Anabaptists be, but he that sleeps there with his eyes open, will be stund no
  more at the hearing of this clamor, then by the barking of the bells in the
  steeple; I must needs confesse that this is matter of weight indeed, and a
  stone is heavy, and the sand weighty, but a fooles wrath is heavier then them
  both: this soon shot bolt is big enough to hure where it hits, but as it
  happens it hits not us: and so happens to hurt them most that mannage it; as
  for us, against whom it is managed, it rejoices us rather then otherwise, sith
  it reproaches and reviles, and saies all manner of evil against us falsely for
  Christs sake <hi>Mat. 5. 11. 12. 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 13. 14. 15. if our dipping were
  such evil doing i. e. murder and adultery as these men say it is, we had reason
  to hang down our heads indeed, and might well be ashamed in suffering from them
  in this particular, but sith as <hi>Paul</hi> said <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 13. they
  cannot prove the things whereof they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse us, we are not ashamed, but
  glorifie God on this behalf.</p>
               <p>Of these two accusers of the brethren Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> is more
  candid, and a little more modest then the other, and yet he utters so much that
  he hath much reason to be ashamed of it, for howbeit he does not so audaciously
  charge us with that foul fact of naked dipping as the other doth, yet by some
  simple supposals,</p>
               <p>First, that persons cannot be rightly baptized by dipping with a
  garment on [as if they may not be put under, and covered and buried therein
  cloathed aswell as naked, and as if a soaking or steeping in water (Mr.
  <hi>Baxters</hi> bald conceit of our dipping) were not a washing or
  burying.]</p>
               <p>Secondly that it is as unwarrantable to baptize garments, as tis
  for the Papists to baptize bells [as if those that baptize persons in garments,
  did as directly, and intentionally baptize garments, as the papists do baptize
  bells, or as if it were more unwarrantable for us to wet the cloathes, that
  persons are baptized in, when we baptize their bodies, then tis for the priests
  to wet the head cloaths of infants when they rantize their faces.]</p>
               <p>By such silly supposals I say as these that there can be no true
  totall dipping, unless the persons be uncloathed, he subtly insinuates the
  world into a certain suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at least a shrewed suspition that dipping
  naked is the onely baptism dispensed among us, for which hee'l once be ashamed;
  but as for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> he is so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous, impudent and uncivilly
  foolish in this present parcel of his, you have here spread before us, that I
  professe against it as having in it much falsenesse, and more immodesty then I
  ever saw expressed at the totall dipping of any person that ever I saw dipped
  in my life: for he not only makes a long supervacaneous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of his
  dislike of dipping women and maids naked (in which is such a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and
  over often nomination of those termes too, as tends more to the offending of
  chast, and corrupting of unchast consciences, then to any use of edifying at
  all) but also most rashly relates it to the whole world to be the usuall,
  ordinary known practise of a people, that are as abhorrent of such abominations
  as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>As for his Argument it is a fallacy called <hi>Ignoratio
  Elenchi,</hi> for he concludes not the point in question, for they, who stand
  most for baptizing by totall dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, are all (for ought that ever I heard of)
  as much against naked dipping as himself: yea so far are we all, (if any had
  been otherwise minded Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> 
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:42067:209"/> would surely
  have assigned them, whose design was to vilifie us what he could, so far are we
  all from countenancing such a practise, that I dare, in the name of all the
  Churches of the Baptists through England, declare their unanimous utter
  detestation of it, in Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own words, <hi>viz</hi> that it is a

  to bring a general reproach upon the Christian profession among all the enemies
  thereof, yea amongst the most sober and discreet, to discredit the truth, and
  prejudice men against it; yea verily tis scandal, reproach and discredit
  e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, in that it is but belied by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to be so base, how
  much more, and more justly would it be reproached, if his reports were as true
  as they are full of falsehood; we I say acknowledg the practise of naked
  dipping to be as bad, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> proves it to be, therefore
  <hi>quorsum haec?</hi> to what purpose doth he with such prolixity proceed to
  prove, what no sober minded man of either party doth deny?</p>
               <p>This is <hi>aliud a nogate;</hi> a plain absurd aberration from
  the question, which is not whether it be a sin ordinarily to dip naked or no?
  but whether we ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly use that kind of dipping?</p>
               <p>The first which none doubts of, he indeavours to make evident as
  one that light<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The second, which is unknown utterly among us, he proclaims to
  be our usual' notorious, known practise: but he offers no proof of this at
  all.</p>
               <p>Such silly Sophistry as this Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> uses also in
  almost every of these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby he professes to disprove our practise
  as unwarrantable, conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all along another point than that in question;
  for whereas our tenet is that persons at years, professing to believe, of what
  parents so ever born, are to be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he most simply, and sinisterly
  concludes against us, as he supposes, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of four or five Arguments
  that the children of Christians may not be baptized when they come to years,
  and that this practise of baptizing of Christians chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is utterly
  unconsistent with the Rule of Christ: as for us we say as much, neither is it
  our practise or opinion to baptize Christians children at age, upon that
  account meerly, as they are Christians children any more then the children of
  them that are no Christians, unlesse they professe to be believers and
  Christians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as their parents do, and upon that account,

  unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, which is the onely thing denyed by them, the absurdity of
  whose way he pretends it to be his businesse to discover.</p>
               <p>For verily those, against whom he fights under the name of
  <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> are as clear in it as he can be, that no Christians child
  <hi>qua talis</hi> is to be baptized when he comes to years, saving upon the
  same account, on which an heathens child may be at years so baptized as well as
  he, <hi>viz.</hi> his own personal profession of faith, and desire of

               <p>Again they hold dipping naked to be intollerable wickednesse as

  monthes, and now rises again and shines forth, in the love therof that they may
  be saved, but have pleasure in unrighteousness and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and have no
  pleasure in the truth.</p>
               <p>Me thinks I see National Ministers of singular piety in peoples
  eyes prove men of singular pravity, singularly bewitched into an implicit
  belief of the base tales that vain fellowes raise of the way of truth, and
  singularly bewitching their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into implicit belief of them, that so it is
  as they say, that neither Priest nor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may obey the truth, but both
  stumble, and fall and be broken, and snared, and taken, and ashamed each of
  other in the end.</p>
               <p>Good Lord how is the practise of the truth made a reproach unto
  thy people, and a derision dayly? for I have heard the defaming of many, report
  say they, and we will report it, possesse the pulpit and make the Priest
  believe it, and then all the Country shall ring out, and the people soon be
  diabolized into the faith on't; but hear ye rude reprochers of that people,
  that are reprovers of the wayes, whereby you run a whoring from the Lord, you
  shall not prevail by such sleights, such plausible pretences, you shall be
  greatly ashamed, you shall not prosper, and, unlesse you repent of your belying
  the truth of God, your everlasting confusion, shall never be forgotten.</p>

  dare I deem Mr <hi>Ba.</hi> to be guilty of the last, but of the two first I
  cannot clear him, sith I perceive that he takes it for a truth that we
  ordinarily dip naked, and thereupon disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it as our usuall
  practise, and then not confidently onely, but of a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the
  whole world that it is no bare word, nor any doubtful thing, but an experience,
  a known practise: if he can clear himself he hath leave to do it for me, who
  also summon him in the name of Christ Jesus, whose true disciples he hath done
  such dispite to (the Lord keep him from despiting the spirit of grace) the
  people of whose love are the people of his wrath, to prove it our practise
  ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to dip naked, yea to produce but one instance of any women of maids
  that ever he saw dipt naked in all his daies, and Ile abate him much of that I
  now accuse him of in the court of my conscience, but if he say as indeed he
  does in effect that he never saw any dipt at all, whilst p. 134. he saies that
  all that ever he saw bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized had water powred on them, how can he say
  <hi>Epertus loquor,</hi> it is his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, he having never so much as seen
  such a thing, unlesse it were upon the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen fac't front of
  <hi>Featleyes</hi> book, where he fasly, feignedly, and filthily describes men
  and women dipping in that fashion, or else upon the Titlepage of <hi>Ephraim
  Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,</hi> who there paltrily pictures out this people practising, thus and
  there I believe he hath experienced it, or if he only hath it from the the

  <hi>England</hi> unless by some <hi>Arch Knave</hi> and <hi>Arrant Whore</hi>
  in way of mockage to the Gospel, which is rather a glory, then a shame to
  Christ his truth, then let Mr. <hi>Ba,</hi> bear the blame of his blind
  blaspheming tho people of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verliving God.</p>
               <p>Or if he know indeed that such a thing as baptizing maids and
  women naked hath been done in serious wise by any persons, I further challenge
  him to make some proof of it, and to print the names of such men as have done
  it; and such maids and women that have suffered themselves to be dipped naked,
  and the names of such credible eye witnesses as will testify it as in the fight
  of God, which if he can, though I shall not give place to him thereupon so as
  to be satisfyed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by for his overlashing in asserting it to be our practise
  to dip naked, or for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and denominating a whole party, much more
  their cause, by the defects &amp; abuses of some persons whom the cause
  disclaimes, for then there was 12. devils because one among the twelve, and
  then what an <hi>Augaean</hi> stable is your Church of <hi>England</hi> by many
  members of which notorious roguery is committed every houre? Yet I shall
  satisfy him so far as to undertake that the Church, or Churches where such are
  shall declare every such person as hath wrought such abomination,
  incommunicable without solemn repentance for that sordid practise, or be

               <p>And sith he avers from his heart page 129. that for his part he

  sense, I begg of him in the bowels of Christ Jesus, that he would now begin to
  be <hi>sine cerâ</hi> a Christian indeed, not by the halves, but
  altogether, for there is yet a mixture of much wax among his honey, and of much
  antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism <pb n="412" facs="tcp:42067:211"/> in his Christianity, and as sure as he
  is ignorant when he began to professe to be a Christian, so sure I am that he
  never yet began to professe to be a Christian in truth, who knowes not that
  ever he was otherwise, but hath and holds his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession as the Turk and Jew
  do theirs <hi>viz.</hi> for the true one at a venture, because they were born
  and bred in it, and received it by Tradition onely from forefathers.</p>
               <p>And as he will prove himself to be what he professes to be
  <hi>viz.</hi> a hater of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant violence, so I advise him to be a hater also
  of violent ignorance, of which hateful quallity in my mind he hath as much as
  any of the greedy gang, <hi>Gangraena</hi> it self onely excepted, not
  excepting Dr. <hi>Featley,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bastwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bayliff,</hi> Mr
  <hi>Pagit,</hi> not any among the proud pack of Prelates, that most
  perheminently prate against the Gospel.</p>
               <p>And sith Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> saies this much more that it is very
  suspicious, and to him unsavory that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> should say no more but
  that it is not necessary that they be baptized naked, as if he took it to be
  lawfull, though not necessary, and thinkes he should rather have given his
  Testimony against it as sinful, and expressed some dislike if he do indeed
  dislike, and judge it sinful, and if he do not he dare boldly say he is very
  far gone, let me say thus much more, that then it is as suspicious, and to me
  unsavory, that Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> should say no more but that it is a breach of
  the seventh commandement, ordinarily to baptize the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as if he took it to
  be lawful to do it sometimes, but not ordinarily: me thinks he should giue his
  Testimony against it as sinful, to do it at all, and express some dislike if he
  do indeed dislike and judge it sinful, and if he do not, I dare boldly say he
  is gone farther in filth, then Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or any baptized person ever went
  yet, save such as are gone quite off from the way of truth to the dishonour of
  it since they owned it, whose sin yet (the more shame for Mr. <hi>Ba.)</hi> he
  in his next ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, laies to the truths charge, and theirs, who both own and
  honour it by a biding in it, who are lesse gladly, and more sadly sensible of
  their sins, and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies then Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> can be, by how much by reason
  of their lasciviuos wayes, which many follow, the way of truth they walk in is,
  as was foretold it should be 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. 2. 3. by Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi>
  and his admirers evil spoken of.</p>
               <p>But if Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> shall still say it is suspicious and
  unsavory for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to say the one, but not for himself to say the
  other, and will none of the foregoing advice to repent and be baptized, but
  rather reject the counsel of God against himself being not baptized, because he
  hath experience (by hearsay) that we baptize females naked, then a rod and a
  rod for the back of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> who pardons to himself the same
  defects, wherein he holds others guilty, who so slenderly takes up every tattle
  a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the truth, and proclaimes it for truth to the whole world, for the
  simple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth every word, but the prudent man looks well to his going

               <p>As for his next and last argument against us which he drawes
  from the judgments of God that ever follow us, wherein he jumbles all kinds of
  sectaries into the name of Anabaptists as the Antibaptists use commonly to do,
  witnesse <hi>Featley</hi> and others, and makes them bear the burden of all the
  mischiefs that were ever perpetrated by all the mad braind men in all the
  world, as <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> and all the rest of his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
  strain, it is scarce current consequence to say Gods judgements are upon a
  people, therefore that people are none of his, for all things come alike to
  all, &amp; none knowes love or hatred by what is before him here <hi>Eccl.</hi>
  8. 14. and the 9. 1. 2. 3. yet sith he speaks of ruinating judgements, let the
  consequence passe as valid, but then his minor is utterly false, for the
  Anabaptists are not all ruinated yet, nor will be till the Clergy are quite
  cashiered, as evident as it is that they have every where withered and suddenly
  come to nought heretofore, and since he speakes of spiritual judgements <hi>e.
  g.</hi> that practise saith he hath never helped, but
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ndred the work of God where it
  comes, nor hath God blest their ministry to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version <pb n="413" facs="tcp:42067:211"/>
  of soules as he hath other mens, but rather they have been instruments of the
  Churches scandal and misery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that hath been the inlet to most other vile opinions,
  few stop at it but go much further, God hath usually given up their societies
  to notorious scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous wicked lives, and conversations more then others that
  professe godlinesse, and never prospered them so far as to have any established
  Churches, which should credit the Gospel. I grant that some of these are sad
  emblems of a people none of Gods, onely Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> hath here saddled the
  wrong asse, for this way of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism hinders onely the work of mans Tradition,
  which would make void the commandement of God, but being it self the work and
  way of God, is hindred where ere it comes by Priestly malice, preaching Gods
  fear after precepts of men, nor hath God blessed the Nationall ministry to the
  true conversion of soules as he hath done theirs, but to the conversion of them
  to a Gospel of their own making, for repent and be baptized was the Gospel that
  <hi>Peter</hi> preached, and that is it that is now practised by us, and how
  many are converted and baptized accordingly is so evident, that it needs no
  proof at this hour, but repent and be not baptized is the Gospel the Priesthood
  preaches, and if you call that conversion, which indeed is confusion, we
  confesse their converts are more more then ours, such instruments of scandal
  and misery to the true Churches are the Priests in all places by their
  reproaches, nor is baptism the inlet of any vile opinions any more then the
  same was in the primitive times, wherein many that were baptized did turne
  hereticks, when they had done, as they do now, but what wise man then impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
  it to their baptism? and yet some of those opinions Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> calls
  vile, will be proved to his conscience in due time to be the truth: yet many
  that are baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed do run out to very vise opinions; and practises no better
  then their principles, and stop not there indeed as he saies, but go much
  further, and degenerate into wayes of wickednesse more abominable then ever in
  former time, and of these Ranters Mr. <hi>Copp</hi> is none of the least
  attainers, whom Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> p. 148. hath very well set forth in his
  colours, for I believe God in Iustice hath given him up, and many other besides
  him to more notoriousnesse of error and enormity, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any that profest
  godlinesse,</p>
               <p>But what then? shall we impute that fault to his being baptized?
  I trow not; for howbeit M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>.
  <hi>Ba.</hi> so imagines, yet it was because he honoured not the truth, when he
  had owned it, nor walked in Christ after he had received him, in which case how
  often God gives over to strong delusions is evident, not only by the word,
  which declares that when men like not to retain God in their knowledge he oft
  gives them over unto vile affection,</p>
               <p>But also by sad experience in the world in these last times,
  wherein 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 1. 1 Tim.</hi> 4 1. and the 2. 3. 1. doctrines of divels
  are rise among them, that once owned the faith, yet the faith not a whit in
  fault for all that, but departure from the saith before expressed.</p>
               <p>And that the fall of these men is into worse then ever before,
  it is no argument against, but rather for the way they newly fall from, the
  sensuality of such as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themselves from the true Churches in the later
  times, i. e. congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal after these are once separated from the false ones
  i. e. the nationall, being prophesied of 2 <hi>Pet. 2. Iude</hi> 19. of old,
  that it should be greater then that of all beastly men that were before them;
  besides <hi>corruptio op imi pessima,</hi> the higher the rise into
  reformation, the more desperate the fall into deformation, of those that reform
  and prove deformed again: that greater depth of hell therefore men fall into
  that fall from us, proves the hight of our Churches to be neerer heaven, then
  that of yours, <hi>for if after they have escaped</hi> &amp;c. 2 Pet. 2. 20.
  21. 22. when <hi>Cop</hi> was in his standing in the Church of
  <hi>England,</hi> I remember very well, for I knew him better then then ever
  since, he had some bounds from conscience to his corruption, but having been
  once inlightned higher then Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ever was yet 
  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:42067:212"/> in the will and way of God, and tasted of the heavenly
  gift, and made a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the holy spirit, and obeyed the truth as it is in
  Jesus, and yet fallen away, his conscience is feard with a hot iron, and I have
  small hope of his renewing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst by repentance, who thus denies the Lord
  that bought him, and cruçifies the Lord afresh, and is twice dead,
  pluckt up by the Roots, a raging wave of the sea foaming out his own shame.</p>
               <p>But what is all this to those that yet walk in truth of baptism,
  more then to warn them that they depart not from it, as he hath done, lest they
  come into the same condemnation with him? doth it prove baptism to be the cause
  of that gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that often followes, when a person is baptized? in no wise,
  for his non abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the love of the truth and that doctrine of Christ gives
  God occasion to give over to the height of wickednesse.</p>
               <p>I appeal therefore to the conscience of Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>

  Christians children, i. e. without their own personal profession of faith, and
  Christianity, in which case heathens children may be baptized also, are to be
  baptized when they come to years, any more then the children of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens?</p>
               <p>Again, who holds or practises such a thing as naked dipping of
  women and maids? not I, nor any man breathing under heaven I imagin, nor will
  any wise man be coxcombd into the belief of it that tis our practice I hope,
  because Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> disputes against it as ours, yet these are the main
  matters argl'd against well nigh in all those pages, yea if he prove the
  baptism of Christians children at years or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to be against rule, tis
  fully sufficient against the Anabaptists, faith he, if we had not a word more
  against them, the man feigns adversaries to himself, and finds himself work
  with them, and takes on and layes about him like a That<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and fights, and
  fences against his foes when he hath none at all about him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, much if not more then a third part of it,
  <hi>viz.</hi> from p. 262. to p. 286. consists almost universally in a
  particular private publike prate to Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> in vindication of
  himself from Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi>'s valedictory vindication of himself from Mr.
  <hi>Baxs.</hi> abuses of him, which tedious, mixt, blattering recrimination,
  and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argumentation, if any save Mr. <hi>Tombs</hi> himself, whom it so
  personally relates to, shall trouble himself with from better employment, and
  the world with any more reply to, then the Lord rebuke him, he hath more time
  then wisdom profitably to improve it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly much if not much more then a third part of the residue,
  <hi>viz.</hi> from p. 289. to 338. he spends in division with other divines for
  pleading and practising baptism to infants from other grounds and principles
  and to other ends and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses then himself doth, as namely, from Tradition,
  and yet in order to baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal regeneration, as Mr <hi>Bedford,</hi> who is
  fain to fly to tradition for proof of infant baptism, and yet holds that
  baptism doth really as an instrumental efficient cause confer, and effect the
  grace of regeneration of nature on infants, which Mr <hi>Bedford,</hi> Dr.
  <hi>Burges,</hi> Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> together with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> himself,
  and I know not how many more Divines, in the meandrous multitudinous mist of
  whose <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> opinions a man may sooner loose himself
  then find the truth, are all ore the tops of the boots in dissentaneous
  discourses about a businesse called baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal regeneration, the quiddity,
  quantity, and commodity of which <hi>non ens,</hi> of which nonsense, as to
  infants, is so curiously pryed into, and learnedly inquired after by them, that
  it is not for every ordinary body, that hath no more learning then
  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> had, who never <hi>Scholasticallized</hi> the
  plain Gospel out of the reach of plain men and poor folks, as our Rabbies now
  adaies do, to come within a mile or two of their meaning; some divining on this
  wise, some on that, some one thing, some another, some that baptism is
  instituted to work the first grace in infants, i. e. habitual, but not in men,
  in whom the first grace is prerequir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> some
  thwarting that by this reason, that baptism cannot have two different uses to
  men and infants, and yet saying with all, that it may be for some ends to the
  Aged, for which it is not to infants, as <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> some saying that
  baptism is a Physical, some a Metaphysical, some a Hiperphysical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument to
  convey real grace into infants, the spirit working it in them thereby
  naturally, or rather supernaturally, as <hi>Mr. Bedford</hi> who holds that it
  really conveyes grace on all infants elect, or non elect, and Dr.
  <hi>Burges,</hi> who yet differs and subdivides from him, holding that it
  conveyes grace on the elect infants only, and not on the non-elect, some that
  baptism is onely a moral instrument, and <pb n="416" facs="tcp:42067:213"/> the spirit
  neither a Physical nor Hyperphysical, but a moral Agent in baptism, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
  and so working on the souls, sealing and conveying no real grace, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
  grace, i. e. right to the real, as <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> who saith that real
  true grace and change of mind is to go before baptism, as a condition both in
  the institution, and every example of baptism through all the bible, therefore
  not to be conveyed in it, this <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> proveth by the institution
  <hi>Math. 28. 18. Mark</hi> 16. and by the examples of the <hi>Iewes,
  Samaritans,</hi> the <hi>Eunuch, Paul, Lydia,</hi> the <hi>Iaylor,</hi> the
  <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who all did gladly receive the word, repent and believe,
  and then and thereupon only were baptized p. 300. and because all this is
  exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of infants, who have no faith nor grace (for to the utter
  confutation of the <hi>Ashford</hi> Disputers, who say infants in <hi>their
  infancy have faith and the spirit of grace, and that apparently enough, the
  Scripture making it plainly appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> professeth that it is <hi>utterly unknown to
  any man on earth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revealed in the word, whether God give infants any
  inherent spiritual grace or not</hi> p 301.</p>
               <p>Therefore to salve his baptism of infants that have not that
  grace, and faith in them, that is prerequired to be in persons to be baptized,
  as a condition, he very goodly tells us that by grace and faith being
  prerequired, as a condition, he means <hi>either in the party or another for
  him,</hi> so then though infants have no faith in themselves yet <hi>o
  mirandum!</hi> they have faith in the loines, i. e. in the hearts of their
  parents, and so are to be baptized, they are buryed in the dipping of the
  Ministers hand saith <hi>Featley,</hi> and believe by the faith of their
  Parents, saith Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus oh how these men, who more stink of the Schooles then skill
  in the Scriptures, are at variance about their own inventions, bending their
  brains some one way, some another, to botch up their businesse of
  infant-baptism, and yet, as fast as one builds up, another of them saves us a
  labour, and razes and pulls down to our hands; oh what stoch, what stuff, what
  stirs, what strife, what stickling, what striking flatly against each others
  principles, what a ditty, what a do is here among them? as if the Divines were
  all mad: so let all the fraternity of divines be divided o God, and fall out
  ever about their own fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, till they find thy truth, and never let them
  agree better among themselves on what account to baptize infants, till they
  (ashamed of themselves, and people ashamed of waiting on the Seers for
  determination of what is truth) be all driven to confesse as (blessed be thy
  name) Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> doth already p. 301. That <hi>they find it a hard
  controversie to prove infant baptism it is so dark in the Scripture, much more
  a hard task to prove different uses of it to men and infants,</hi> as needs
  they must if they prove it to be of use to infants, for it signifies not at all
  to them as it does to men, and so to conclude, to the freeing of themselves
  from that puzzle and perplexity, and fire of contention that now they fry in,
  for their hatred of that one onely plain way of truth that leades to piece,
  that verily tis not thy will that any infant at all should be baptized; and let
  Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> who was once in doubt of infant baptism, upon sight of the
  slender grounds that other divines did hold it from, till satan seduced him
  back again to the belief of it again, be perswaded, if it be thy will, on sight
  of the more weak and slender principles, which with much ado he hath found out,
  whereon to satisfy himself and others, and to sit still in the shadow of that
  superstition, to be not almost onely, but altogether, saving their sufferings
  from him, such as thy servants are, whom he yet vilifies what he can.</p>
               <p>As then to <hi>Mr. Baxters Appendix</hi> of Animadversions on
  Mr. <hi>Bedfords,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burges,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wards</hi> absurdities
  about baptismal regeneration of infants, tis no matter to us, yea I conceive it
  a likely means of it self to make wise men renounce Infants baptism, that read
  there at what ods they are, and how they wrangle among <pb n="417" facs="tcp:42067:213"/>
  themselves that own it; beside sith he that passing by meddles with a strife
  not belonging to him is like one that takes a dog by the ears <hi>Pro.</hi> 26.
  17. ile passe by for my part, and not meddle with it at all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, another part of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> book is a small
  slender tract of about one leaf long penned in proof of baptisms a biding a
  standing ordinance of Christ to the worlds end, and therein so far am I from
  excepting and contradicting, that I rather approve it, &amp; considering the
  high head of contradiction that in this last loose age already is, and within a
  while much more, and more headily will be made against it, and how the
  subtility of Satan is such that sith he can uphold his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome now no longer
  by his old souldiers t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  Rantizers, which changed the lawes and ordinances of Christs kingdome, he seeks
  to do it by erecting a new moddle, of men, I mean the seekers, and Ranters, who
  rase the very foundations of it, and how sith he can prevail no more to deceive
  the nations from the narrow way of truth by his old Spiritualty the spiteful
  Priest, he hath spit a new Spiritualty out of his mouth, from which as from a
  greater Carnalty then the other, the earth, that it may be ripe for the sickle
  as it must be at Christs coming, shall abound with abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination i. e. they that
  separate themselves from the true Church after their sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with them from
  the false, sensual having not the spirit, yet pretending more highly to it then

                  </gap>ay, I seriously side with Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> as to that subject, and
  to shew him, who simply supposes we are all a people posting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the
  pulling down of Christs ordinances, because some do, and because all of us, as
  we are sworn to it, seek what we are able to pull down mens, to shew him I say
  notwithstanding his conceits to the contrary, how close we keep ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to

  who are (to use his own phrase p. 26.) above ordinances i. e. above obedience
  to God, and so Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, I intend God willing before this work escape

  having been often requested to it by others in vindication to the truth.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, as for the forepart of Mr. <hi>Baxs.</hi> book, for

  would fain flatter into a faith, that each of them is a Church of Iesus Christ,
  yet I must crave leave to inform those Churches from Christ, that as yet they
  are no other then Churches of the Popes calling and constitution; for the
  parochial posture of Christning, and so inchurching of all that are born within
  the bounds, and barely abide within the preincts of the parish, had its order
  from the head of those Churches <hi>viz.</hi> the Vicar of Christ; but not at
  all from Christ Iesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yea and though there may be many honest men in
  both <hi>Ked.</hi> and <hi>Bewdley,</hi> among whom if Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> be one
  it shall not grieve me at all, yet according to Dr. <hi>Featleys,</hi> nor yet
  according to Mr. <hi>Baxs.</hi> own definition, who say a true visible Church
  is a <hi>particular company of men professing the Christian faith, known by two
  markes viz. t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  those two parishes are true visible Churches of Iesus Christ, for neither were
  they ever yet called out of the world, or separated from the world to God in
  that wise i. e: by such meanes, and in such manner as Christs Church is i. e.
  by the pure <pb n="418" facs="tcp:42067:214"/> preaching, of the word and pure power of
  God, but rather by the power of the word of man i. e. partly of the Pope, and
  partly of the civil sword in this nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of old, under a penalty imposing upon
  them their present posture; nor is the word preacht to them to this hour
  sincerely by Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> or any other parish minister, who unlesse he sing
  a new song will make them no more a Church of Christ then he found them, but
  with wonderful much mixture of mans invention; yea the fear of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God is
  taught by him according to the precepts of men, much lesse are the Sacraments
  rightly administred, for their baptism is no baptism at all.</p>
               <p>And as touching separation, I know but three separations they
  have had since they stood under the name of Christian Churches, answerable to
  the different Christian Religions, of point blank Papism, prelatical
  Prostantanism, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Presbyterianism, which the parishes haue past under
  since they have been Parishes, viz. a Presbyterian separation by appointment of
  the present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who on pain of their displeasure commanded all to
  separate from the lesser superstitions of episcopall formes, ceremonies,
  services, to a finer and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectorian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kind of Protestant profession;
  a generall Protestant separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Appointment of our english state under
  K. <hi>Ed.</hi> and Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> who commanded all on pain of their
  displeasure to separate from the Romish grosser superstitions, Popes
  Supremacies, masse and other Marian opinions and professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, also a parochial
  and a paropopical separation, or distinct oppidal division of their particular
  selves from each other, and all other particular Churches i
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Towns besides themselves, by
  the appointment of the Pope and his Subs and Subsubs <hi>viz.</hi> Christian
  Emperours, Kings and Princes, who when they threw down their Crownes, and gave
  up all their power to make one beast called Christien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and themselves and
  theirs to be ruld and reignd over wholly by the whore at her wil, did both
  separate all Christendome from the world, and then sub-separate it into many
  smaller Christendomes, and constituted Churches i. e, national provincial,
  parochial: and thus <hi>Ked.</hi> and <hi>Bew.</hi> first began to be Churches,
  or societies visibly separated from the world viz. by the call of the Pope, who
  separated one parish from another; but Christs Churches had another separation
  i. e. by the word barely preached, and not by outward force imposed, they were
  called to faith in Christ, and baptism, not Rantism, into his name for
  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, and after that continued in the Apostles doctrine, and in
  fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship one with another, not forced, but free, and in breaking of bread
  and prayers: these are the Churches to which as then, so now the Lord adds
  dayly such as shall he saved, and therefore I must tell Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> and
  the honest men in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ked.</hi> or <hi>Bew.</hi> that are of Mr.

  they repenting both for and from their dead works, and their vain conversation
  in point of baptism, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Church-fellowship &amp;c received by Tradition
  from their fathers, and their unadvised zeal in siding to smite Christ with
  reproches thorow the sides of the true Churches, be baptized better then ever
  they have been, and do as those did in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. which as no infant then
  did so now none can do, they have neither the true matter nor the true form

  enough too, neither that nor walking in fellowship being requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them, as
  it is of others, and be baptized according to his will, shall be owned as the
  true visible Church of Christ in these two parishes as Christs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the residue of Mr. Bs. book which coutaines his arch
  argumentation from three principles for infants baptsm viz. their discipleship,
  Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and rightship of being dedicated unto Christ, is for the
  most part, to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of any that are minded to own the truth, though
  not so intentionally in way of formal answer to Mr. Ba. so fully and
  effectually enervated before, where the same arguments, as they are used by
  others, are examined, that it could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount <pb n="419" facs="tcp:42067:214"/> to no other
  then superfluity, and Tautologie to answer them over again, because they are
  urged in another, that is a more pedantick for me by him, whose work is not at
  all to produce any new principles from which to prove the point, but onely to
  improve more largely in a way of labor more long then strong, to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age more
  formally in a way of hipothetical syllogism, and to drive on more furiously
  these few old ones; therefore excuse me, specially since Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath
  given reply some while since, who is more strictly concern'd in it, if I am
  loath, unless there were more need then Mr. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The truest general verdict I can give of it, if I may speak my
  judgement without offence, is this, it is a three footed stool, the legs of

  then that, but this therefore that; when not seldome neither this nor that is
  true; but will you hear the conclusion of the whole matter? it is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ma.</hi> If some infants be disciples, and churchmembers,
  and to be devoted to God therefore to be baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>mi.</hi> But so they are,</p>
               <p>Therefore to be baptized.</p>
               <p>To which besides the sequel of the Major, which I shall shew to
  be utterly false, i'le prove the Minor false by the prosecution of this
  Syllogism.</p>
               <p>If infants be neither disciples in any sense, much lesse that in
  <hi>Mat.</hi> 28 nor church members of a Gospel Congregation, nor are to be
  devoted to God in such a sense as the Jewish males, then not to be
  baptized;</p>
               <p>But so they are not,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> not to be baptized.</p>
               <p>As for his <hi>Mediums</hi> whereby he Argues infants to be
  disciples, they are so frivolous and foolish, that a very child may be ashamed
  of them.</p>
               <p>The first, which is taken out of <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. is so
  abundantly declared to be <pb n="420" facs="tcp:42067:215"/> absurd before, that I need not
  clear it further, and therefore I'le say the lesse to it here, he argues thus
  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those i. e. all those on whom the false teachers would have put
  the yoke of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision were disciples,</p>
               <p>But some of those on whom they would have layed that yoke were
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> infants are disciples.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> of which is a foundation so false and infirm,
  that I stand amaz'd at it that a man of Logick should dare to lay it, yet well
  nigh every one of you builders lay it as your basis, from whence you divine a
  discipleship to infants, and thereon build the businesse of their baptism, as
  Doctor <hi>Featley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall</hi> and others, yea who would think
  it? <hi>inter scribendum</hi> while I am a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this very line in Answer to
  Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> there is a triste brought to my hands of a sheet and a half,
  piping hot from the presse, penned by Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> of <hi>Marden,</hi>
  son to that Mr. <hi>Simpson</hi> of <hi>Bethersden,</hi> whose private letters
  I answered above, stiled a soveraign preservative against Anabaptism, in which
  there is <hi>nihil novi,</hi> no newes at all, for tis a furtive collection of
  some few fraggments out of other men <hi>viz. Mr. Blake,</hi> the
  <hi>Ashfordian dispute</hi> and others, which all are also more then enough
  enervated before, whereupon I shall trouble my self no further then thus with
  that toy, the author whereof in his epistle to the Anabap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>sts, as he calls them, about <hi>Marden,</hi> tells
  strange stories of his being stormed on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very side, and almost tired out with
  onsets and oppositions from their private let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and among the rest he minds
  them how he had once to do with a host of them <hi>viz. September</hi> the
  tenth 1649. in which conflict my self, who was more then an eye witnesse,
  though much inferior to a worthy brother then in presence also, <hi>viz. Mr.
  Blackwood,</hi> and therefore far from arrogating to my self the title of
  Champion, with which he smites me in his Margent, can testify how uncivilly and
  shamefully the man stormed against the truth, insomuch that unlesse he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
  of the mad-blind, hare-brained zeal he then expressed, many, if not most of
  that Auditory he then interrupted, whether he remember them of it or no, will
  surely never forget it while they live.</p>
               <p>In which book,, I say as there is no new Argument, so to be sure
  there is this old Argument, as well as some more, translated out of Mr.
  <hi>Bax.</hi> or some other, whereby to prove infants discipleship p. 20.
  because the false Teachers would have put the yoak of circumcision on them.</p>
               <p>But Sirs what though they would have put the yoak on the
  disciples necks, will it therefore follow that they were all disciples on whose
  necks they would have put the yoake? me thinks it should not, if you look well
  about you, any more then this, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> put the yoak of Tribute on all the
  Jewes, i. e. taxed all the Jewes,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> all they were Jewes whom <hi>Augustus</hi>
  taxed.</p>
               <p>Nay verily had it been said they would have put the yoake of
  circumcision on all the disciples, as it is not, yet would it not have held
  <hi>Retro</hi> that therefore all those on whom they would have put the yoak
  were disciples, but in very deed neither of those was true, for as it was not
  all the disciples on whom they would have put that yoake, for they did not
  teach that women should be circumcised, so all were not disciples on whom they
  would have put that yoak, for male infants not being capable to be taught
  cannot possibly be disciples at all, much lesse such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as are meant in
  that place, of whom it is most evident that they were taught <hi>verse</hi>
  1.</p>
               <p>Much more might be said in disproof of this foolish fancy but
  that enough is spoken to it before, yet this is the first <hi>Medium</hi>
  whereby Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> bends himself to make it good that some infants are
  disciples, and his other are as mean to the <pb n="421" facs="tcp:42067:215"/> full as
  this, he proves it next by a disjunctive thus,</p>
               <p>If infants be not disciples, it is either because they are
  uncapable so to be, or else because God will not shew them such a mercy.</p>
               <p>But neither of these can be the cause,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> some infants are disciples.</p>
               <p>To which I answer that tis not because God will not shew them so
  great a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for most undoubtedly the Lord shewes far greater mercie then
  that, though not that to infants that dy in infancy, for he saves them and
  gives unto them ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life, and admits them into the Kingdome of Heaven,
  and as for that bare simple notion, outward account and denomination of
  disciples, what extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary great mercy is that I wonder if it be abstracted
  from the other? tis not so great a mercy but persons may have it, and yet be
  damned for all that, nor so great a mercy, but that the mercy of God may be as
  great to them without it, nor so great as that they are capable of any more
  benefit by it from the Church, or from their parents, then they are capable of
  if they have it not, they may be prayed for by the Church and by their parents
  full as much, and be brought up by them in the nurture and admonition of the
  Lord, not onely as well, but much better, when they are capable of being
  disciples, and instructed, though in infancy neither counted disciples, nor
  baptized, as if they were supposed to be disciples before they are taught,</p>
               <p>It is therefore because they are not capable to be discipled in
  their nonage, and the true reason why they are not capable, is that which Mr.
  <hi>T.</hi> alledged, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las that it should not satisfy Mr. <hi>Bax.
  viz.</hi> because they cannot learn what is taught them.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> knowing that, fetches a compasse about another
  way whereby to prove them capable to be disciples, <hi>viz.</hi> their being
  servants of Christ, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Christs Kingdome, and thirdly their
  belonging to Christ, but what a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful piece of proof, what a messe of
  miserable mistake is this, as if to belong to Christ, to be Christs subject,
  Gods servant, and Christ disciple were convertable, and alltogether one and the
  same, wheras howbeit it cannot be denyed but that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very disciple of Christ
  belongs to Christ, and is his Subject, and Gods servant, yet that every one who
  may be said to belong to Christ, to be Gods servant, and his Subject, is
  Christs disciple cannot be asserted without more absurdity, then Mr.
  <hi>Bax.</hi> is willing to take notice of in himself, for Mr. <hi>T.</hi>
  gives him an <hi>Item</hi> of it plain enough, for any reasonable man to
  consider of, but he is deaf to it through a mind forestalld against the
  truth.</p>
               <p>He tells us that infants are capable to be Gods servants
  <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 41. 42. and therefore consequently Christs disciples, and
  consequently to be baptized, for disciples and Gods servants signifie the same
  thing, denote the same persons, and that there is the same capacity requisite
  to both p. 18. 19. yea if there be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence saith he, there is more
  required to a servant then to a diseiple, but what wretched evidence is here,
  when as theres nothing more clear, and palpably evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, then this, that more
  is required to make a disciple then a servant, yea veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the consequence
  holds sound from Christs disciple, to Gods servant, but from Gods servant to
  Christs disciple, which is his way of arguing a very novice may see it rotten,
  and invalid: there is enough in all the creatures, the earth and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
  which as books, wherein we may read it, though not as men that make any verball
  narration of it, declare the glory of God <hi>Ps.</hi> 19. 1. to denominate
  them Gods servants <hi>Psa. 119. 91. Nebucad. Nezar</hi> had enough to
  denominate him Gods servant <hi>Ier</hi> 43. 10. as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> truly tells
  him, but not enough to denominate him Christs disciple.</p>
               <p>Yea I appeal to Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> own conscience, whether at that
  time, when Christ exercised his ministry among the Iews, the whole Nation of
  the Iews as well as those he mentions out of Levit. 25. 41. and in the self
  same sense with those, were <pb n="422" facs="tcp:42067:216"/> not, <hi>Iure
  Redemptionis</hi> by right of his Redemption of them from Egypt, the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
  of God, had relatively a peculiar people to himself, yet how few of them were
  Christs disciples <hi>viz.</hi> those onely that attended to his law, in which
  respect though he stile all Israel his servants, yet he distinguishes those few
  onely from the rest that harkned not to his law, by the denomination of his
  disciples <hi>Isaiah</hi> 8. 16.</p>
               <p>And whereas he saies of infants may they not be called Gods
  servants from the meer interest of dominion that God hath to them? p. 20.</p>
               <p>I answer, who doubts of that? but may they thereupon be called
  disciples, and be baptized? if so then from the meer interest of dominion that
  God hath to all men, all men may be called Gods servants, as well as they, and
  so consequently be baptized as Christs disciples.</p>
               <p>He tells us further p. 21. <hi>that infants are capable of being
  subjects of Christs kingdome,</hi> taking kingdome not in the larger sense, as
  it contains all the world, nor in the strictest as it containeth onely his
  elect, but in a middle sense as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teins the visible Church, therefore
  consequently capable of being Christs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and of baptizing; and to
  prove the antecedent <hi>viz.</hi> that they are subjects of Christs kindome i.
  e. members of the visible Church, he uses this <hi>medium,</hi> they are
  capable of being subjects in any kingdome on earth, and therefore why not of
  Christs kingdome saith he i. e. of the visible Church of Christ?</p>
               <p>Now if this be a good consequence, they are capable to be
  subjects in any Kingdom on earth and therefore to be subjects of Christs
  Kingdom i. e. his Church, then the infants of heathens as well as these, being
  capable to be subjects in any Kingdom on earth, are consequently as capable to
  be subjects of Christs Kingdom and Church, and consequently to be Christs
  disciples, and in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy to be baptized, but <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi>
  himself will say <hi>non sequitur</hi> unto this.</p>
               <p>He tells us further that <hi>Christ would have some infants</hi>
  i. e. believers infants, for those he meanes, <hi>to be received as disciples,
  therefore some infants</hi> i. e. such <hi>are his disciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prove the antecedent he jumbles together a number of places
  out of <hi>Mat. Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> viz. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 5. the 10.
  42. <hi>Mark. 9. 41. Luke</hi> 9. 47. 48. in one of which places because Christ
  saies of a child, who so shall receive this child in my name receiveth me, by
  comparing this place with the rest, where Christ saies to his disciples, and of
  them also, not of infants, whoso shall give to you a cup of water in my name,
  because you belong to Christ, or as <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it in the name of a
  disciple, he shall not loose his reward, he gathers that some i. e. believers
  infants are disciples, and to be received to baptism, as such, for saith he, in
  Christs name, and as Christs disciple, and as belonging to Christ are all one
  in Christs language.</p>
               <p>To which I answer,</p>
               <p>First, by denying that in <hi>Christs name, and as a
  disciple,</hi> and as <hi>belonging to Christ</hi> are all one: for in
  <hi>Christs name</hi> is a Term of larger extent and latitude then the rest, so
  that we may be said to do good in Christs name to some persons, whom yet we
  cannot do good to as belonging to him in that neer relation of his disciples:
  <hi>in the name of Christ,</hi> besides severall other significations, which
  the phrase hath, is as much sometimes as for Christs sake, who requires it, and
  to do good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the name of Christ is to do good to them for Christs
  sake, and then we may be said to do good for his sake, not onely when we do
  good to them that are disciples of Christ, upon that account of their belonging
  to him as his, but also, when we do good to them that are none of his
  disciples, upon the meer account of his command, who injoines all persons as
  occasion is to do good to all, though especially to the houshold of faith:
  whereupon also I perswade my self varily, nor is it very unworthy of
  observation, that the spirit when it speaks of doing good <pb n="423" facs="tcp:42067:216"/> to profest disciples indeed <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 41. he incourages to
  receive them, not onely in the name i. e. for the sake of Christ so requiring,
  but as belonging to him also as his disciples, in the name of a Prophet, in the
  name of a righteous man, in the name of a disciple; but when he speaks of our
  doing good to that child <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 48. he saies no more then barely
  <hi>in the name of Christ</hi> i. e. for the sake of Christ owning such an
  action, but expresses not the other notion, and account of discipleship, and
  Relation to him, as that on which he would have him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>Moreover were it otherwise, it would make little to the purpose
  of Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> who brings it to prove some such sucking infants as men
  sprinkle, i. e. believers babes to be disciples, sith that it was a believers
  child of which Christ there speaks, or that he speaks of such children rather
  then of the children of other men, is much more then Mr. Ba. can ever clear,
  and that it was a child of such a stature as to come to Christ, when he cald
  him, and therefore no infant of a span long, nor such as is the subject of your
  sprinkling, is too clear for Mr. Ba. to gainsay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out clear contradiction
  of the Scripture <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 2.</p>
               <p>These are far fetcht faddles, whereby Mr. Ba. backs his people
  in the blind belief of his fond and false opinion that all believers infants
  are Christs disciples, and thereupon to be baptized.</p>
               <p>The <hi>mediums</hi> whereby he manifests their membership in
  the Gospel-church are many, more then a good many, and not more many then
  manifestly weak, and utterly unavailable to such a purpose.</p>

  tells us that we shall never be able to justifie it, if we lay out but the
  thousandth part of our time, study, talk, or zeal (yet if he have not spent the
  twenteth part of his own, I am must mistaken) upon this question it self,

  distinctly to such a mint of impertinencies as are handled at armes end here by
  Mr. Ba. for my own part I am not minded to tire my self to much with tracing at

  af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mr, Ba. into every corner of that laborinth of Logick, into which he
  leads me, and yet leaves me after view and Review as little ground for infant
  baptism as if he had said nothing at all: nor shall I bury my self up from
  better imployment in the bottomlesse pit of those absurdities, which this part
  of his book also is fully fraught with, partly because I find that most that he
  saies there is in effect answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red already in the book called
  <hi>Anti-babism,</hi> where the genuine sense of the main Scriptures he rests
  into his own use, is given out <hi>viz. Rom. 11. 1 Cor. 7. Mar. 9. 36. Rom. 4.
  11. Mal.</hi> 2. 15. partly also because I perceive a vain of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
  contest with Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to run thorow the whole, which Mr. <hi>T.</hi>
  according to the particular interest he hath therein, hath already taken notice
  of in Print, so far as its worth an answer, partly also because I am not so
  happy as to have the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of many, scarce of any of the churches of
  Christ, whose servant I am, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering me hitherto, without such frequent
  avocations of me from this to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of another nature abroad, as are
  inconsistent with my writing of much more at home.</p>
               <p>Neverthelesse besides some animadversion of as much of its
  absurdity as may be with conveniency, I shall take the sting out so clearly
  that it shall not hurt, and that by both a clear, though general disproof of it
  all, and as clear though gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <pb n="424" facs="tcp:42067:217"/> and brief
  demonstration of the contrary,</p>
               <p>Take notice therefore of the most cardinal argument, upon which
  he grounds infant church-membership under the Gospel.</p>
               <p>It was so once that infants were of the church, and it is not
  repealed, therefore it is so now.</p>
               <p>To which I answer, by granting twas so from <hi>Abrahams</hi>
  time, and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Christ (for before that time all the pairs he takes doth
  not, and all the braines he hath in his head cannot produce the least sollid
  proof of such a thing) for all that Church and the materials of it were a
  ceremony and a type, and never the viler for that, as Mr. Ba. foolishly fancies
  p. 59. of the church under Christ, twas so in that outward typicall covenant
  that God made concerning an earthly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> with the natural feed of
  <hi>Abraham</hi> in the loines of <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> not
  <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael,</hi> Gen. 17. 20. 21. nor any of his seed by <hi>Keturah,</hi>
  Gen. 25. 1. 6. upon the performance of certain carnal ordinances as
  circumcision, and the rest of the ordinances of Divine service pertaining to
  that covenant, which circumcision bound them to till the time of reformation
  <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. but that therefore tis so now in the church under the
  Gospel-covenant, that was typified by the other, I utterly deny, whose heavenly
  inheritance and spirituall seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> i. e. believers born of
  God by faith in Christ, answer as the Anti-type to that earthly
  <hi>Canaan,</hi> and fleshly seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and before which the
  type is fled away, for all the ceremonialls of that law are vanisht, among
  which this admitting of fleshly babes was one, and what it pointed at is
  shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abundantly in Anti-babism, which may serve as an answer also to his
  fourteenth argument, for their present membership, where if the law of
  infant-Church-membership were ceremonial, he bids us shew what it tipified: the
  mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership therefore of infants, which belonged onely to that particular
  Church of the Jewes, which was also the whole universal visible Church that God
  then had upon earth, unlesse we shall dream with Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> of more
  particular visible Churches then that of the Jewes during its standing,
  different from it in form, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and constitution, which together with that
  made up some one universal visible of which infants were members first, as he
  dotes, and then secondarily of that particular; which conceit of his concerning
  such a universal visible, is a meer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible <hi>chimaera,</hi> for who ever
  saw any visible Church, or people whom God visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly inchurched, and gave his
  oracles to besides Israel? of whom it is said God dealt in that particular, as
  he did not with any other Nations, suffering all others to walk after their own
  waies <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 16. nor can there be now any universall visible Church,
  but what is made up of the particular visible Churches, so that a person must
  first be a member of some particular Congregation, before he can be of that
  universal: the Membership I say of infants that belonged to that Church onely,
  which was to be National, and tipical of that true holy nation i. e. all the
  saints, where ever scattered, is now repealed, nor can any of that Mr.
  <hi>Ba.</hi> syllogizes to us evince the contrary.</p>
               <p>He tells us that if it be repealed then either in justice, or
  mercy to infants, but it is in neither saith he p. 38. <hi>Ergo.</hi> he falls
  a proving the <hi>Minor,</hi> but with his leave I shall make bold to deny the
  <hi>Major,</hi> it was neither better nor worse as to the whole
  <hi>species</hi> of infants, it was severity to unbelieving Jewes, goodnesse to
  believing Gentiles, but twas not done with any such special respect to infants
  in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>onage, as that if it had
  stood the whole <hi>species</hi> of infants through the world would have been
  much the better, for such a meer titular thing as membership, in the Church,
  unlesse that membership would <hi>Ipso facto</hi> have more intitled them to
  heaven, nor now its taken away are sucking infants ere the worse, for saving
  the great dignity that you deem to ly in the bare title of being a member of
  the visible Church, whether they dy before your admission of them, or just
  af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if in infancy, their salvation is for that neither more nor lesse, and
  if they live to <pb n="425" facs="tcp:42067:217"/> years as they are then are no longer
  infants, and no neerer heaven for their being baptized, when they were infants,
  unlesse they repent and believe the Gospell, so repenting and believing it,
  they are as capable then of heaven, though they were not, as if they had been
  baptized, and in bare church-member ship from the womb: this therefore is petty
  reasoning indeed as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> calls it see Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>His second, third, fourth, fifth, six Arguments are all out of
  <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. which place, as I have declared my sense of it before, so I
  testifie again is so clear against the standing of infants as members in the
  family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or Church of God now under the Gospel, that he is
  as blind as a beetle, that sees any thing in it tending to the proof of it, for
  it seems plainly that the natural branches, or seed of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi>
  and <hi>Iacob</hi> themselves, that stood the children of the Church before
  without faith, upon the meer account of being their naturall branches, cannot
  stand children of the Church now, unlesse they be also spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual branches, as
  <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> were; yea if being the fleshly seed
  of a believer could ingraft persons into the Gospel Church, as it did of old
  into the Jewish Church without faith, then the Jewes to this day, being asmuch
  believing <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural seed as ever, might by that birth stand
  Members as truly, as any Gentile believers seed, but they cannot, yea the same
  persons that were members of that Church without faith, were not admitted to
  passe from that Church to membership in this, for want of faith; but when very
  forraigners, that had no relation to, nor descent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> became
  his children in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel sense, and members of the Gospel Church by
  personal faith, the very natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was cut off
  through unbelief, so that the standing before was by a fleshly birth of
  <hi>Abraham,</hi> of some believing proselited Gentile, but the standing now in
  the Church is not by a birth natural of any parent, no hot of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
  himself, unlesse there be faith in the persons themselves, as Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> believes not there is in any infants, for to the confutation of
  the <hi>Ashford</hi> Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, which pleads infant-faith, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
  p. 98. Makes the very essence of faith to lie in assenting to it that Christ is
  King and Saviour, and consenting that he be so to us and whether infants do
  thus both assent and consent let Mr. Ba. be judge of it if he please.</p>
               <p>Because of unbelief the natural seed were broken off, thence Mr.
  <hi>Bax.</hi> argues that infants stand still in the Church, but thence I argue
  they cannot stand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those that stand now stand by faith <hi>ver.</hi>
  20. i, e. personal, not parental; <hi>thou standest</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) by
  faith,</hi> i. e thy faith, not thy Fathers, for then we may as well say the
  just shall live by his fathers faith, not by fleshly descent, though of
  <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> themselves, as of old they did, and
  infants cannot stand by faith unlesse they had it, and therefore not at
  all.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> argues it was the Jewes own Olive tree or
  <hi>Church</hi> they were cut off from for unbelief, Therefore infants stand in
  it still, But the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ce I argue that
  our infants cannot stand therein, for if god spared not the Naturall Branches
  of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but broke them off their own root, their own father
  <hi>Abraham</hi> and his family, so as to be counted no longer his children,
  their own olive tree the church so as to abide no longer in it, because they
  believed not, the terms of standing church-members being now no fleshly descent
  but faith, then much lesse will he admit any Gentiles, that are not naturall
  branches of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be grafted into the good olive tree without
  faith, and therefore no infants that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not.</p>
               <p>Mr Ba. tells us that some branches only were broken off,
  therfore not infants, It is true all were not broken off, and why? because some
  believed, and so abode in the family, others and those the most believe not
  when they should, others and those all infants nor believed, nor yet could, and
  therefore could not abide, nor have a visible being, a visible membership, a
  visible standing in <pb n="426" facs="tcp:42067:218"/> that visible church, the termes of
  standing in which is only and alone by faith.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> argues that Israel shall again be grafted into
  their own olive tree, and saved, even the children with the parents, and
  therefore infant-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the Gospel church is not repealed.</p>
               <p>I answer it is true that if they abide not still in unbelief,
  they shall be grafted into their own olive tree, the visible Church, and family
  of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is so many as shall believe onely, this infants do
  not, but whether they believe or believe not, when the Redeemer, i. e. Christ
  Jesus shall come, all Israel shall be saved, and be owned, and made the most
  glorious people upon earth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a flourishing state indeed, but not
  in this way of baptism, and member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> speaks of, who I
  perceive is not a little ignorant of this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery as yet, how long blindnesse
  shall happen unto Israel, and in what manner their calling shall be, of which I
  also have at this time as little list, as leasure to inform him.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> argues from the samenesse of the Olive tree the
  Jew was broken off from, and the Gentile was graf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ed into, that therefore as infants stood members then,
  so they must now.</p>
               <p>I answer it is true there is some kind of indentity between the
  Jewish, and the Gospel Church, but not such as concludes an indentity of
  membership for infants, they are the same <hi>ingenere visiblis Ecclesiae,</hi>
  they agree in the common name of Church, and visible Church, elected and
  segregated from the world, but there's little else that I know of wherin they
  are the same, they differ in circumstantials, in their accidental forms, in
  their officers, ordinances, customs, constitutions, subjects, members, that
  being constituted of one whole nation of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or fleshly seed of
  <hi>Abraham,</hi> taken out from all other nations, this of a spiritual seed of
  <hi>Abraham,</hi> i. e. believers scaterred here and there, taken out of any
  nation as they happen to be called, almost every nation some, the ceremony of
  inchurching <hi>Abrahams</hi> own, much more any other mans meer fleshly seed
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceased.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> peddles on a pace, and brings a company of
  Scripures in proof of infants Church-membership and baptism, which though he
  stile them, as indeed his whole book, <hi>Plain Scripture proofs for those
  two,</hi> yet a man that is not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to force the Scripture into the Service
  of his own fancy, because it does not serve it freely, may look till dooms day
  before he see in them any plain, perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous proof of either one of these or
  of the other.</p>
               <p>Christ saith he <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37, would have gathered
  <hi>Ierusalem</hi> oft, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
  but they would not, therefore sure he would not have put them, or their infants
  out of the Church, the strength of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence lies here, saith he, he
  would have gathered whole <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and that into the visible Gospel
  Church, therefore infants also; Now that Christ does not speak of whole
  <hi>Ierusalem</hi> here, as he saith he does, both men and infants, the
  circumstances of the text do fully evince to us, for he speaks of the same
  persons he speaks to, and the same persons he complains of, saying <hi>ye would
  not,</hi> the same and no other are they to whom he speaks, when he saies, Oh
  <hi>Ierusalem</hi> how often would I have gathered &amp;c. but those were men
  and women only, whom he called to believed in him, and not infants.</p>
               <p>Again he gathered them by preaching of the word into baptism,
  and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, and received all that came, and no more <hi>viz.</hi>
  sometimes the children and not the parents, sometimes the parents and not the
  children, so that a mans foes for the truths sake sometimes were they of his
  own family, his own flesh, therefore he offered not to gather infants, for he
  preacht not to them, nor called them at all, nor were any more baptized and
  added to the Church-fellowship in the Gospel, then they that gladly received
  the word, that did not infants, yea 3000 were <pb n="427" facs="tcp:42067:218"/> gathered
  into the first Gospel Church by preaching and baptism in one day, and never an
  infant among them all, for they surely did not continue in fellow ship, in
  breaking of bread and prayers <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Therefore whereas Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> in his Epistle to the parish
  of <hi>Bewdley</hi> challenges Mr. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</hi> to name him one particular Church since
  <hi>Adam</hi> either of Jewes or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, where infants were not
  Church-members, if they had any infants, till 200 years ago; I name him the
  first Gospel Church that ever was <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>t.</hi> 2. in which there was not one infant; yea there was three
  thousand baptized in one day, and it is a hazard but that those three thousand
  had many, perhaps no lesse than three thousand infants belonging to them all,
  and yet as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> thinkes, so think I, that none of their infants
  were baptized with them, much lesse were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with them to the Church, or
  continued with them in fellowship, as the whole Gospel Church did, in breaking
  of bread and prayers; yea though-there was no infants in that Church, which was
  gathered at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it self, to which Christ saies how oft would I
  have gathered thy children, &amp;c. and therefore Mr. <hi>Baxs.</hi> sense is
  very sinister, so I challenge him again to shew me, not by such dubious, muddy,
  cloudy, circumlocutory, inconsequential consequences as he doth, but undeniable
  evidences any one of all the Gospel C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>urches of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times, either of Jewes or Gentiles, which

  admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and I shall cry him mercy, and lay down the Cudgelis at his feet,
  and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge he hath broke my pate.</p>
               <p>The next Scripture he uses is more impertinent then this, yet
  Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> makes a certain shift to squeese an argument out of it, and to
  compel it <hi>invita minervâ</hi> not a little against its own intent,
  and meaning to corroborate his crooked cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie creed concerning the inchurching
  and cristening of infants <hi>viz. Rev.</hi> 11. 15. whence he thus
  Syllogizes,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the kingdoms of this world either are or shall be the
  kingdomes of the Lord, and of his Christ, then infants also must be members of
  his kingdom</hi> i. e. the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, the Antecedent is the words of the
  text indeed, as he saies, but the sequel is so sure, and follows so firmly in
  his fancy, that he saies nothing can be said against it, that is sense or
  reason: but indeed it self is against both sense and reason.</p>
               <p>Who would ever think, if the word did not declare that the
  things of wisdome are hid from the wise and prudent, that such a disputer as
  Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> holds himself to be, should deduce the now membership of
  infants, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>om such a premise as
  this <hi>viz.</hi> because the kingdomes of this world are, or else shall be
  the kindomes of God and Christ? whats this I trow toward the eviction of the
  other? much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way saith Mr. Ba. yea so much, that for any thing he can see
  this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> text <hi>alone were sufficient to decide the whole controversie
  whether infants must be Church members,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amen so beit say I, let this Scripture decide it, and let's see
  what Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> saies out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If they can say,</hi> quoth he, <hi>by kingdoms is meant
  here some part of the kingdom, excluding all infants, such men may make their
  own creed on those termes, let the Scripture say what it will, I know in some
  places the word kingdome, and Ierusalem &amp;c. is taken for a part, but if we
  must take words alwayes impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, because they are taken so sometimes</hi>
  saith he, <hi>then we shall not know how to understand any Scripture,</hi> so
  of necessity it must be understood properly i. e in its prime signification of
  the whole kingdoms, and whole <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with him, and not improperly
  for a part onely, though Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> to Mr. <hi>Black,</hi> saith upon
  occasion of our pleading for the proper signification of <hi>baptize, nothing
  more or dinary then to have words used out of their prime signification,</hi>
  whereby we may see <pb n="428" facs="tcp:42067:219"/> how these men wil needs have that
  signification that best serves their turnes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper or improper, when
  the proper most fits them, then the improper cannot be meant there, when the
  proper makes against them, the improper is pleaded for as none more usual then
  that, thus the word houshold must include infants, when baptism is spoken of,
  but when the passover is spoken of then infants are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, because else we
  shall argue from thence to their eating the supper, as they from circumcision
  unto their bap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ism, but this by
  the way that it may be noted how the men will have things their own way, by
  hook or by crook, not that I deny the word kingdomes to be taken properly for
  all the whole kingdome here, yea I grant it, but let us see what of that? why
  even this, if the whole kingdom be the Lords, then infants must unavoidably be
  members of Christs Church, and if we ask how comes this about? he will tell you
  two wayes,</p>
               <p>First, as infants are all of the Kingdomes of this world, taken
  for the whole kingdom,</p>
               <p>Secondly, as by the word kingdom of Christ is meant Christs
  church.</p>
               <p>Now let us spell and put all together, and it is thus much,</p>
               <p>First, by Kingdomes of this world is here meant the whole
  Kingdome of this world, or Kingdome taken universally, not for some part of it
  one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by Kingdomes of the Lord and his Christ is here meant
  Christs church onely.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, infants are a part of the Kingdomes of this world, and
  so consequently of Christs church, for the Kingdomes of this world are become
  the Kingdomes of the Lord and his Christ i. e. Christs church, oh brave and
  plain Scripture proof for infant church-membership and baptism.</p>
               <p>Let us examine what is true and what is false in this.</p>
               <p>First, as above, I grant that here the Kingdomes of this world
  signifie the whole Kingdome, as he pleads it, but that here the Kingdome of the
  Lord and his Christ signifies Christs church, I utterly deny it, and am amazed
  that a reasonable man should affirm it, and so consequently I deny that it
  appears from this place that infants are now members of Christs church.</p>
               <p>But he brings reason for it, such as tis, and that shall be a
  little exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>First, if they say saith he that the Kindome of Christ is not
  here meant Christs church, they speak against the constant phrase of Scripture,
  which calls Christs Kingdome his Church, <hi>et conversim, Christ</hi> is King
  and saviour of the same so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, what is <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom but his
  church?</p>
               <p>To which I answer, Christs Kingdome is the whole world as well
  as his church. And</p>
               <p>Secondly that he is King and Saviour of all men in some sense as
  well as of that same society. And</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that it is not against the constant phrase of Scripture
  to say by <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdome here is not meant his church, for
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hough it is true by his Kingdome
  is sometimes exprest his church, <hi>et retro</hi> by his church is meant his
  Kingdome in a special and restrictive sense, yet not constantly, there being
  many places where the word Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> is taken in a larger
  sense, as signifying not the church, but the whole world <hi>O bad.</hi> 21 the
  Kingdome i. e. <hi>Monarchy</hi> of the whole earth <hi>shall be the Lords</hi>
  i. e. <hi>Christs</hi> so <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. the <hi>Kingdome</hi> i. e.
  <hi>Dominion, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and greatness of the Kingdome under the whole heaven is
  given to the son of man, and the Saints,</hi> yea his Kingdom is over all, he
  shall rule the Nations, govern and judge the whole world in righteousnesse;</p>
               <p>Oh saith Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Christ</hi> is
  more large, and more speciall; but here it cannot be meant of his kingdom in
  the larger sense, nor as he ruleth common societies, and things for so saith he
  the Kingdomes of this world were <pb n="429" facs="tcp:42067:219"/> ever the Lords and his
  Christs, and it could not be said that they are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so.</p>
               <p>To which I answer,</p>
               <p>First, that in granting what he here does, that Christs kingdome
  is taken some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a larger sense, then for the church, he contradicts
  himself above, where he saies it is the constant phrase of Scripture to call
  Christs Kingdome his church, and what is Christs kingdome but his church?</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas he saies the Kingdomes of this world were ever
  the Lords and his Christs in the larger sense, as taken for his Government and
  Rule, I grant <hi>de jure</hi> Christ hath been Lord of the whole earth a long
  time, but <hi>de facto</hi> he is not King, so as actually to reign over the
  whole earth, as ere long he shall do i. e. at his appearing 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.
  1. to this very day, but in that indeed i. e. when he comes he shall be King,
  Monarch over all the earth, and rule with a rod of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron over the Nations, and
  judge the world in righteousnesse together with his Saints, who hath been
  judged in unrighteousnesse by the Nations and Rulers hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto <hi>Zach. 14.
  Dan. 7. Act. 17. P. 2. Rev.</hi> 2. then he shall be in point of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, as
  before by commission, and really, and actually, as now intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally King of
  Kings, and Lord of Lords <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. but till then, as yet a little
  while, and his Kingdome comes to his hand, and the Kingdomes of the world do
  thus become his, for the work of recovery of his right is now very hot in
  <hi>fieri,</hi> and will not be long before it be in <hi>facto esse,</hi> till
  then he hath been an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and other Lords besides him have had dominion
  over him in his, and also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole earth, which is his, and over the
  Kingdomes of this world, which <hi>de jure</hi> are his, but specially that
  <hi>servus servorum, dominus dominorum</hi> the Pope and CCClergy, that are the
  whore that hath reigned in three divisions over the earth, between whom and
  Christ the great justle now is in all christendome, whether he or they, that by
  permission have had it so long from Christ, who onely hath the commission for
  it, shall be King of Kings and Lord of Lords, hitherto Christ hath reigned in
  the world as <hi>Charles</hi> the second hath reigned in <hi>England,</hi> and
  no otherwise i. e. hath reigned in the hearts of a few of his friends and
  follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
               <p>But I perceive the Gospel or good news of the Kingdome of Christ
  coming, which is to be preached more had more before the end, is yet a riddle
  to Mr. Ba. and though I hope it will be, if seeing he will see, yet tis not yet
  given him to know the mystery and manner of Christs Kindome.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas he saies that the Kingdom taken in the larger
  sense i. e. for the world cannot be meant here, but the church onely by this
  phrase the <hi>Kingdomes of the Lord and his Christ,</hi> I strongly assert
  that of all places in Scripture the word Kingdomes of Christ cannot here be
  construed for the church, that the church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be meant in that phrase, but
  the Kingdomes in the largest sense i. e. the whole world, and directly
  oppositly to Mr. Ba. who saies it is the church, I disprove his opinion
  thus,</p>
               <p>First, If by the kingdomes of Christ be meant the Church, then
  it must be thus read, <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdomes of this world are become
  Christs Church, but what an absurdity must that be, specially with Mr.
  <hi>Bax.</hi> above all men, who so strenuously contends that by the word
  Kingdoms of this world is meant not in part only, but the whole kingdom? for to
  hold that by that phrase the Kingdomes of this world is meant all the kingdomes
  upon the earth, taken wholly, and not <hi>Synechdochically</hi> for a part of
  those kingdomes onely, and that by the kingdom of Christ the Church onely, is
  to make the sense thus, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole world is become Christs Church,
  therefore it cannot be so, but thus (and so all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the text
  do evince, for it is spoken of Christs raign over all the world in the latter
  daies, after the seventh Trumpet hath sounded, and not over all his Church
  onely, and of Christs taking to himself <hi>ver.</hi> 17. that great
  <hi>Monarchy, <pb n="430" facs="tcp:42067:220"/> power,</hi> kingdome, or greatnesse and
  glory of his reign, which before he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be in the hands of the
  Dragon, beast and whore, so that they reigned over the whole earth, and the
  saints too in rigour, and unrighteousnesse <hi>Rev. 13. Rev. 17. ult:</hi> I
  say it must be thus <hi>viz.</hi> the Kingdomes of this world, the Kingdomes
  under the whole heaven, the Monarchy of the whole Earth is now come into
  Christs own hands, or the Government over all is now actually on his
  shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>Besides what will Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> gain more by his sense of
  that Scripture towards the proof of his infant-membership then I for the
  membership of heathen infants, then for the Church membership of the whole
  world, if I were minded to plead for it, if the Kingdomes of this world wholly
  taken, none excluded, do become the Church of Christ then all men as well as
  infants must be Church-members on that account.</p>
               <p>Besides he speaks as <hi>de futuro</hi> what shall be under the
  seventh Trumpet, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it were to be taken as Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi>
  imagines that the Kingdomes of this world, infants as well as men, are now
  become Christs Church, then it would evince that it was not so from the
  beginning of the Gospel Church, for what effects are spoken of as falling out
  now newly under the seventh Trumoet, are things that never were in being
  before.</p>
               <p>Besides observe Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> how he pleads to have
  Kingdomes taken in the largest sense in the former part of the verse, and how
  angry he is if it be taken for lesser then all the whole kingdomes of the
  world, but in the latter part where Kingdomes must needs be, and is as largely
  to be taken (for it is the Kingdomes of the world are become Christs Kingdomes,
  i. e. dominion, not Christs churches) there he will needs lace it up into the
  narrowest acceptation that the word kingdom can possibly bear.</p>
               <p>Oh therefore the grosse pieces of ignorance, that are in that
  Argument of his for infants membership in the Church, which he grounds from a
  Scripture, that will as well prove all the world to be Gospel Church-members as
  believers infants, if his very own false sense of it should be admitted, but in
  truth proves not the one nor the other; thus he argues viz. the Kingdoms of
  this world, i. e. all, and all in them shall become Christs kingdomes,
  therefore infants of only believers, not heathens, are Church-members under the
  Gospel.</p>
               <p>He that saies this followes any better then the Pope follows
  <hi>Peter</hi> in the holy chaire shall never be counted, or voted <hi>mentis
  compos,</hi> whilest I am <hi>compos voti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> therefore had better have found 40 shillings,
  where he never looked for it, then have looked for infant-membership in this
  scripture, where he will never find it with his eyes open.</p>
               <p>His three next Arguments, <hi>viz.</hi> the ninth, tenth, and
  eleventh run all upon one strain, and therefore as he need not have made more
  then one of them, so I need not make more then one answer to them all, yea, I
  need make none at all, having spoken to that point sufficiently before, yet a
  hint of it here may do no hurt.</p>
               <p>They stand all upon one bottome, <hi>viz.</hi> the meliority of
  the times under the Gospel above the times of the Law, of this new covenant
  above the old, the summe of what he saies is this, if believers in fants may
  not now be members of the visible Church, then both Jewes and Gentiles are in a
  worse condition now then before Christ, and Christ is come to be a destroyer,
  and not a Saviour, and to do hurt to all the world, the believing Jewes, and
  the Church; yea and the very Gentiles thereby, in regard of the happinesse of
  their children, are in a worse condition then of old, but this is a vile
  doctrine, saith he, for Jesus <hi>is a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of a better covenant
  established on better promises Heb. 8. 6. where sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded grace much more
  abounded, Rom.</hi> 5. 14, 15. 20. and the love of <pb n="431" facs="tcp:42067:220"/>
  Christ love hath height, length, depth, breadth, and passeth knowledge
  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>To which simple inconsequent conceits I answer by denying the
  consequence, it followes not that the world is in worse estate under Christ
  then before, because infants might be members of the Jewish church, but not now
  of any visible church of the Gospel, nay verily the world is in a far better
  condition then formerly, by how much they are under more clear, and plain
  promulgations, more fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>re and
  u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal tenders of salvation, then in the narrow or shadowy dispensation of
  the Law, and also under greater love, richer grace, better and more glorious
  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, unlesse they fall short of them, through their own unbelief, then
  those which were made to the natural Israelites onely, all whose glory was but
  a type of the other, for the great favor, love and promises of God to them, as
  meerly <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacobs</hi> natural seed, unlesse they
  also believed, and then they, as now all the world might be heirs with
  <hi>Abraham</hi> of the grace and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Gospel, did make them heirs
  of that earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> onely: but the Gospel grace makes all men heirs
  on termes of faith and obedience to Christ, of the glory of the heavenly
  <hi>Canaan</hi> for ever, the grace of God that bringeth salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto all
  men now appears: and as for infants, albeit no infants now be baptized into
  fellowship with the visible Church, nor are priviledged as the Jewes infants
  once were with interest in the blessing of an outward earthly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
  nor yet vouchsafed that meerly titular account, of sanctifyed and peculiar
  people of God, as in opposition to other infants, as by birth, accountatively
  sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, common and unclean, which distinction of a birth holiness and
  uncleaness Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had he but half an eye in his head might clearly
  see <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 28. is so taken out of the world and ended in Christ,
  that now no man however born, no not a Gentile may be called in that sense as
  the Gentiles were of old in reference to the Jewes, either common or unclean,
  and if no man can be called by birth common or unclean in reference to other,
  then none may be called by birth holy in reference to other, for this birth
  holinesse and uncleannesse are such <hi>Correlatives</hi> that the one cannot
  be supposed to be in the world without the other; albeit I say no infants have
  now such standings in such external happines and salvation, yet they are in no
  les capacity to be saved then the Jews children of old, &amp; so neither their
  pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents whoever they be, in any worse condition in regard of their comforts in
  their children, whether they dy infants, or live to years, then the godliest
  Jewes were in regard of theirs, for either infants dy in infancy, or else do
  not, if any mans infants dy in such nonage as in which they never committed
  actual transgression, our <hi>Ashford</hi> Pamphlet tells us they have <hi>not
  deserved to be exempted from the generall state of little infants declared in
  Scripture, viz. that of such is the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> yea I wonder what
  should damn such dying infants, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had iniqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y of their own, sith God himself
  assures us that the son shall not dy i. e. eternally for the iniquity of his
  father, but every soul that dyes shall dy one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his own iniquity,
  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18. and no better hopes could be harboured of the Godliest
  Jewes infants then this, that dying infants they were not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>But if any mans children, even his that is ungodly and prophane,
  do live to years, then if they believe and obey the Gospel, the tender of which
  is to every creature, they may be saved though their parents be wicked, when
  Iewes chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren not doing so, shall be damned, for all their father
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and their own Church-membership for a time, and that
  with so much the greater condemnation: whereas therefore Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> tells
  us such a story of a meliority of being in the visible Church rather then out,
  I tell him it is not universally true, but as it may happen, for besides that
  children may aswell be prayed for, and instructed by their godly parents,
  remaining unbaptized, and non-members in their nonage, as if in infancy they be
  admitted to both, it may so fall out, and <pb n="432" facs="tcp:42067:221"/> mostly it did
  among the Iewes, that a lifting up to heaven in respect of partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of
  outward priviledges and ordinances, may prove an occasion unhappily through
  their abuse of it, of their sinking deeper into hell.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is drawn from Deut. 29, 10. 11. 12. a place
  that doth as well prove that all the wives and the servants, and the slaves,
  even all the hewers of wood and drawers of water are to be taken into Covenant
  with God, as his, and admitted into Church-membership upon the Membership of
  Masters, and Husbands, as little ones upon the membership of the Fathers; and
  so indeed it was in those daies, wherein the whole body of the Nation was
  inchurched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, though not so now, therefore though I might easily
  discover that (yea he is blind that sees it not in the same chapter,
  notwithstanding it is alledged in that allusion of <hi>Paul</hi> in the tenth
  chapter of the <hi>Romans</hi> to that place) to be no other then that covenant
  which was made with the nation in particular, which God brought out of
  <hi>Aegypt,</hi> yet I shall trouble my self to say no more to it then so.</p>
               <p>His 13 Argument is from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. where circumcision
  is said to be a seal of the righteousnesse of the faith which <hi>Abraham</hi>
  had, is answer'd above, where I have given out the genuine sense of that place,
  and disproved that crooked construction, which is by others aswell as him
  commonly made of it, therefore ile say no more to it here.</p>
               <p>His 14 Argument is also answered, but a little above, where I
  have shew'd the inchurching of that fleshly seed to be ceremonial, and also
  what it typed out, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more of that also in this place.</p>
               <p>His 15. <hi>plain Scripture-lesse proof for infants present
  churchmembership and baptism is this</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If all infants, who were members of any particular Church,
  were also Members of the Universall Visible Church, then certainly the
  Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of infants,</hi> he means by vertue of the membership of their
  parents, <hi>is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But all infants who were &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The consequence saith he is beyond dispute, because the
  universal Church never ceaseth here, yea the whole Argument so clear, that were
  there no more it is sufficient.</p>
               <p>To which as unanswerable as he judges it, I answer first by
  denying the consequence of his <hi>Maior,</hi> as most flatly false and
  inconsequent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by saying as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> did, whose answer is both
  solid and sufficient <hi>viz.</hi> that infants membership in the universal
  visible church was only by reason of their then membership in that particular
  national church, neither can Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> while he breathes prove them to
  have bin members of that universal visible, as he calls it, but as they were
  members of that, and therefore when that particular, nationall church of the
  Jewes ceased, the standing of infants as members upon the meer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of
  their parents membership ceased also therewith, as one of the things that were
  not essentiall to a church, but circumstantial onely to that church, as one of
  the particular accidental ceremonies pertaining onely to that individual
  nationall church; for accidental ceremonies Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> himself confesses,
  and must confesse did cease still with that particular church, to which
  particularly they related, otherwise he will be paid home with his own weapon,
  and in his own coin, yea if Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> consequence be true, and if it
  be not so as we say, that accidentall ceremonies, and so this accidental
  ceremony, and circumstance of infants being members upon the membership of
  their parents, did cease with that particular church of the Iews, twill passe
  all the braines Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> hath in his head to answer his own argument,
  if we retort it on him in proof of that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as much as we do the
  inchurching of infants upon the fathers membership <pb n="433" facs="tcp:42067:221"/>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> the inchurching of wives, and servants to this day upon the
  membership of their husbands and masters, for whereas he argues thus
  <hi>viz.</hi> if all infants who were members of any particular church were
  also members of the universal visible church, then certainly the membership of
  infants by vertue of their parents mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership is not repealed, but all &amp;c.
  Ergo</p>
               <p>What answer will he make, if we answer him by arguing back upon
  him thus <hi>viz.</hi> if all wives and servants, who were members by vertue of
  their husbands and masters membership of any particular visible church, were
  also members of the universall visible church, then certainly the membership of
  wives and servants, hewers of wood, and drawers of water, by vertue of their
  husbands and masters membership, is not repealed, but all &amp;c. Ergo.</p>
               <p>I leave it to wise men to consider and examine whether Mr. Bs.
  argument doth not as fully tend to the proof of it that the wives and servants
  ought, as of old, to stand members in the visible church now, upon the husbands
  and masters membership, as infants upon the membership of their parents.</p>
               <p>Several other palpable absurdities are obvious to every
  observant eye in his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of this argument, which whoever notes, will
  take heed of pinning his faith implicitly on Mr. Bs. sleeve, and of listning to
  his Logick, so as to be led by it besides all sense and reason.</p>
               <p>To say nothing to his <hi>universall visible,</hi> which is
  little lesse then a <hi>visible bull,</hi> for <hi>sensus, adeoque visus est
  proprie solum modo singularium, intellectus universa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,</hi> the proper
  object of sense, and so of sight is particulars onely, and universalls onely
  properly of the understanding, yet this universal visible church is the
  univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal vision, and dream of the universal Clergy, but to bate them the
  baldnesse of that term, and grant that there is a Catholike visible church, is
  there any unver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal visible church, but what is existent in, and made up of all
  the particular visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble churches? I trow not: yea that was wont to be good
  Logick, and Theology too heretofore, to say that all the particulars make up
  the unversal, that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall visible Church, and all the particular
  visible Churches are adaequate, and convertible, yea Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> p.
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>2. makes the universall visible
  church, and all the particular visible churches equivalent, the <hi>universal
  or formall church</hi> saith he i. e. <hi>all the assemblies of Christians in
  the world:</hi> the whole is not broader then all its parts collectively taken,
  nor without its parts, for <hi>omne totum ex suis partibus constituitur,
  ordinatur, mensuratur, determinatur,</hi> every whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of its parts,
  is measured and determined by its parts, and so the whole univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal visible
  Church, and all the homogeneall parts of it <hi>simul sumtae</hi> i. e. all the
  particular visible churches taken together, are of equall latitude; so that he
  that is of a any particular visible church must needs be of the whole, and he
  that is of the whole universall visible must needs be of some particular
  visible church, yea <hi>cui adimuntur omnes partes totius universalis, eidem
  etiam totum universale adimi necesse est,</hi> whoever is not a part of some
  part or other i. e. of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular visible church, cannot be a part of the
  whole i. e. the universal visible: this I say is the Logick and Theology, which
  was wont to passe for currant among your selves, but Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> learnes
  men a new kind of Logick <hi>viz.</hi> that all the parts put together are not
  so big as the whole, that the universall visible church is larger then all the
  particular visible churches in the world, of which yet it consists, so that
  there is room enough for a person to stand a member in the universal visible
  church, though he be of no particular visible church at all; I ever understood
  yet that he, who is removed and cast out of all the particular visible churches
  of the Saints, is consequently cast out of the universal visible church, but he
  tells me a tale that to be removed out of every particular visible church, is
  consistent still with a standing in the universal visible: so that
  excomunication out of all the particular visible churches in the world, is not
  excomunication out of the whole visible church with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:42067:222"/> Another thing worth noting, though worth
  nothing, is this, he tells us there that <hi>Keturahs</hi> children, when they
  left the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that they <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued members of the
  universal visible church still,</hi> which compared with the clause above,
  where he tells us <hi>that it is a far higher priviledge to stand in the
  universal visible church then to stand in any particular whatsoever,</hi>
  amounts to thus much <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Midianites,</hi> for they were
  some of <hi>Keturahs</hi> chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, had far higher priviledges, then those
  that the Israelites had by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members of that particular visible church of
  Israel, which if it were so, then we may say what advantage hath the Iew
  indeed, and what profit by circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by Gods commission of his oracles
  unto them? yea what necessity of circumcision of themselves, and their males at
  all for any strangers, or of joining themselves to that particular church of
  the Jewes, sith they might have had as high priviledges if they had joined
  themselves to the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Keturah,</hi> of whose
  posterity circumcision, nor the strict law it bound to was not required, and so
  consequently what need of baptism, if persons might be of the uniuersal
  visible, which is the greater, though not of the particular visible church of
  the Iews, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out circumcision and keeping the law?</p>
               <p>But it is a question with Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> whether
  <hi>Keturahs</hi> children must leave their seed uncircumcisied p. 60. yet I
  tell him it is out of question, that unlesse it were in order to joining, and
  inchurching themselves with that individual Church of of the Iewes, to which
  pertained peculiarly the adoption, and glory, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and law, and
  promises, and which was all the visible church, that I know God had then upon
  the earth, circumcision was not enjoined to any other of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> own
  posterity, not the <hi>Ishmalites,</hi> nor <hi>Midianites,</hi> but those
  onely that came of <hi>Sarah</hi> by <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> for the
  covenant, of which circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was a sign, was establisht with none of them,
  but with <hi>Isaac</hi> onely and with <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his seed after him,
  and so many as should join themselves unto them.</p>
               <p>Many more odd conceits about this universal visible church, Mr.
  <hi>Ba.</hi> broaches, but I spare him, and hasten to what followes.</p>
               <p>His 16. plain <hi>Scripture-lesse</hi> proof for infants
  church-membership and baptism is from a clause in the second command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ment <hi>viz. I will shew mercy to
  1000s of them that love me, and keep my commandements,</hi> a phrase out of
  which a man may as easily prove the Pope to be head of the church, as prove
  either of those points in proof of which he doth produce it.</p>
               <p>Yet oh the miserable muddy, wretched, ragged, crooked, cloudy
  piece of disputation for infant baptism, which this man makes from that
  place!</p>
               <p>For my part I mean not to wander after him in that wildernesse
  of worthlesse discourse, that he vents about mercy, Church covenant, promises,
  nor am I so wise as to wot what he means, nor so foolish as to believe he knows
  well what he means himself by much of that he there utters, or else he would
  never say that wicked men in the church are within the covenant, and so have
  this mercy spoken of in the second commandement stated on them by promise; as
  if wicked men in the church were in some special wise beloved of God, when yet
  they are more hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him by far then heathens.</p>
               <p>It is enough to serve my present purpose, that what proof Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> pens in the head of this argumentation, his own pen dashes it
  all out again in the taile of it.</p>
               <p>For first after a great deal of wiestling to make the mercy here
  promised to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of them that love God, necessarily to include
  church-membership, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses at last that it lies doubtful in the text what
  mercy in particular is there meant, which if he do, then tis not necessary that
  church-membership be implied in it, for there may be much mercy, yea special,
  yea eternal saving mercy shewed to <pb n="435" facs="tcp:42067:222"/> persons, to whom the
  mercy of membership in the visible church and baptism is not vouchsafed, or
  else what becomes of such infants, as notwithstanding your timely admittance,
  do yet dy without both membership and baptism? are they shut out of the kingdom
  of heaven?</p>
               <p>Secondly, he confesses it is doubtfull in the text to how many
  generations God shewes mercy to the children of parents t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>at love him, whether it be to the remote or neerest
  progeny onely; and though he passe his judgement that it is onely to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
  children of godly parents, that the promise in the commandment is made, yet
  thereby he contradicts his own sense of the place, and overthrow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s all that he contends for, in that if
  the words were as he would have them read, <hi>viz.</hi> I shew mercy to a
  thousand Generations, or to the thousandth generation of them that love me, it
  were evident that he meant not the nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> generation only, for that to a thousand generation should signifie
  no more then one generation to come is most irrational, and plain brutish to
  imagine; and if he say tis to a thousand ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, if such children succeed
  their parents in godlynesse, that sense excludes infants quite from the mercy
  here promised, and extends it to such children o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ely as are at years, and that on condition of being
  godly themselves, and on that condition of being godly themselves God shewes
  mercy to the immediate seed of the very wickedest parents, as well as of the
  Godliest parents in the world.</p>
               <p>But in very deed to put him out of all his doubts at once about
  this place, <hi>viz.</hi> whether God mean the remote or immediate children, I
  desire Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that this promise is not made to any
  mans posterity at all, but only to all such individual persons as love him, and
  keep his commandements, for the words are not as he reads, and construes them,
  <hi>viz. I will shew mercy to a thousand gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of them, but to thousands
  of them that love me,</hi> i. e. to thousands of such people, such persons as
  love me and keep my Commandments; and so if the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were that of membership,
  yet it were nothing concerning infants in their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at all, but concerning
  thousands of such individual persons as love him and keep his commandments, or
  else God must shew mercy to all infants in their infancy to this day, meerly
  for their father <hi>Noahs</hi> sake, though the immediate parents be wicked,
  and if he he do not he shewes not mercy to the thousandth generation of
  believers infants, there being not a thousand generations from <hi>Noah</hi> to
  this day.</p>
               <p>We may see what little plain proof these men can find for their

  the first 1651. in a publique discourse with my unworthy self, being desired to
  assign some particular place of Scripture, where Christ commands the practise
  of infant-baptism, assigned the second commandment, to whom as I said then
  before hundreds of people, so I testify here again before the whole world, that
  if any man see infants baptism commanded in the second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is
  because his eyes are out: for though he tell me that the generall scope of the
  second Commandment is to command all Gods people to observe all Gods
  institutions from time to time, yet I tell him again, as also I did then, that
  infant baptism is none of those institutions, yea I tell him yet further, and
  Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> also, that unlesse it can be made appear by plainer Scripture
  proofs then ever were yet brought by either of them, that Christ Jesus injoined
  the baptizing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churching of infants, or that its any other then a
  tradition of man, and an addition to the Gospel, which was not so from the
  beginning, and that is more then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them will ever make plainly to

  all that are baptized into the same body are to do 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. which
  infellowshipping persons by the halves into Gospel participation, if it be of
  Christ, what else is of man I plainly know not.</p>
               <p>His 17 plain <hi>Scripture-lesse</hi> proof for infants
  Church-membership and baptism is drawn from <hi>Psalm.</hi> 37. 26. where it is
  said that <hi>the seed of the Righteous are blessed,</hi> whence he argues as
  before, and therefore need not have made a distinct Argument of this, if God
  have pronounced the seed of the righteous blessed, then certainly they are
  members of his visible Church, its absurd once to imagine quoth he, that god
  should pronounce a society blessed, and take them for none of his visible
  Church.</p>
               <p>But I am ashamed of such trifling stuff, such straw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, and stubble as he here builds upon,
  as if God himself can no way be said to blesse the seed of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
  unlesse he require them to be baptized, and inchurched visibly in their
  infancy, as if God had but one blessing, even that of baptism and
  church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, upon which all other blessings are so eternally intailed,
  even to infants, that such of them as attain not to an actual interest in these
  are <hi>ipso facto</hi> accursed in all respects else &amp; that for ever,
  wheras to say nothing how that phrase <hi>the seed of the righteous</hi> may be
  taken for the race of righteous ones, that succeed one another in
  righteousnesse, as well as a seed of evil doers <hi>Is.</hi> 1. 4. for the
  whole race of evill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that succeed their fore-fathers in evil doing, for
  these indeed I take to be the seed to which the Scripture oft pronounces
  blessing and cursing, and not alwayes the meer natural seed of good men and
  bad, for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> there is manifest
  falsehood in many promises and threats, the natural seed of righteous men often
  perishing, and being not counted their own fathers children, unlesse they be
  like them in righteousnesse as <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 39. Christ denies
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> natural children to be <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> children, and
  blessed with him, because they did not as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and contrary
  wise the natural seed of the wicked prospering, when they do well, contrary to
  <hi>Prov. 2. 21. 22. Is. 20. 14. Ps.</hi> 37 20. if the word seed were there
  taken for the natural seed, where it is said the seed of evill doers shall
  ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be renowned;</p>
               <p>And so <hi>the seed of the serpent, and the children of the
  devil</hi> expresses those that do his works, to say nothing I say of this,
  which yet is enough to blunt the edge of Mr. <hi>Bas.</hi> argument, grant the
  word <hi>seed</hi> here to be taken for the natural seed of the righteous, even
  those in infancy may be many wayes blessed though they neither be baptized in
  infancy nor inchurched, yea they may be blessed with eternal sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, dying
  in infancy, without either baptism or membership in the visible Church, for I
  hope you will not say those 1000s. of Jewes and belieuers infants, that have
  died before circumcision, baptism, and visible admission, are damned without
  any more ado, because they fell short of your admired membership, and if these
  be blessed with salvation to whom you delay baptism, why not those to whom we
  deny it? doth our denying baptism to an infant before he dies send him to hell
  sooner then your delaying it till he be dead?</p>
               <p>But however the seed of the righteous may be blessed with many
  temporal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, as provision, fruitfulnesse, multiplication, and yet not
  be taken into the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, and to say the truth if Mr.
  <hi>Ba<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> had not been resolved to wrest this Scripture besides its
  true sense, to botch up his proofs into a multitude, he might 
  <pb n="437" facs="tcp:42067:223"/> easily have seen by consultation with the verse before
  that it is not such a thing as membership, that is here meant by the word
  blessed, but meer matter of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward sustentation; <hi>I never saw the
  righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread; he is ever merciful and lendeth
  and his seed is blessed</hi> i. e. provided for, and preserved from beggery,
  and considered by others in time of adversity, as he considered others in the
  like case.</p>
               <p>And lastly, whereas he challenges us to shew where ever God
  pronounced any blessed, and yet took them for none of his visible Church?
  saying tis absurd once to imagine it that he did, I assert it is most absurd in
  him to imagine the contrary, for God himself by promise pronounced
  <hi>Ishmael</hi> blessed, saying as <hi>for Ishmael be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I haved blessed
  him, and I will make him fruitful, and multiply him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and make him
  a nation, because he is thy seed:</hi> and this at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same time when he
  denied to establish the Covenant with him, which he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht with
  <hi>Isaac,</hi> and commanded that he should be cast out of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
  fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from sharing with <hi>Isaac</hi> in that very covenant, which Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends with all his might p. 64. 65. that whoever are not in
  it are not under the promise of the mercy, which Church-membership is with him
  a speciall part of.</p>
               <p>In proof of this consider and compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 18. 19.
  20. 21. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 10. 11. 12. 13. as if there were no blessing but
  that of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership, or atleast no blessing without this of
  Church-membership, whereas, as admired a mercy as this meer membership is with
  Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> persons may be blessed without it, and also (witnesse the
  Jewish Nation, which for the most part were reprobates) they may have admission
  to the meer mercy, and bare bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of membership, and yet perish and be
  accursed for ever.</p>
               <p>The 18th. <hi>plain Scripture-less proof for infant
  Church-membership and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If infants were Church-members before circumcision was
  instituted, then certainly it was not proper to the Iews,</hi> and consequently
  is not ceased, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are, therefore. The <hi>Minor</hi> of which
  argument Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> endeavours to prove as well as he can, and this he
  doth,</p>
               <p>First, partly by perverting the sense of the text <hi>Mal.</hi>
  2. 25. where it is said God made two one i. e. instituted the ordinance of
  marriage between man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and woman, that he might seek a seed of God i. e. a
  legitimate Issue, for legitimacy onely in the issue is the result of marriage,
  and that among what parents soever, even heathens as well as others, for whom
  as well as others that state of marriage is sanctified, yet Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
  saies he made two one, or ordained marriage that he might seek a seed of God in
  another sense, that better serves his turn i. e. to seek Church-members, as if
  Church-membership in the seed, were the direct result of the state of matrimony
  in the parents, which every simpleton knowes to be false<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for marriage is
  honourable among all, and was ordained for all mankind as well as the Godly,
  and yet the seed are not therefore Church-members; besides marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was
  instituted in the state of innocency, to this end that mankind might be
  propagated in a more modest way then other creatures, and not that the seed so
  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated might be Church-members.</p>
               <p>Secondly, partly by a heap of frivolous conjectures of his own,
  in which a man may warrantably enough chuse whether he will believe him or no,
  but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Minor viz.</hi> that infants were Church-members before
  circumcision was instituted be true or false it makes nothing to his purpose
  unlesse he had made surer work in his <hi>Major;</hi> for that is so
  inconsequent, and utterly unsound that had I happened to have heard his
  argument before it came in Print, I should have spared him all his paines about
  the <hi>Minor,</hi> and have put him to the proof of his <hi>Major,</hi> the
  consequence of which hee'l never make good by fair play while he breathes; for
  there were many things long before circumcision was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, 
  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:42067:224"/> which were proper, if not to the Jewes till the Jewes
  were in being, yet to the ceremoniall law that was after more clearly given to
  the Jewes, and to that old Testament of which <hi>Moses</hi> was the Mediator,
  and circumcision the sign, and the Jewes the subject, and yet were tipicall and
  ceremonial onely, and so ceased together with circumcision, as the keeping the
  seventh day, the sacrifices, the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and uncleannesse of certain
  creatures, and (if that were at all before circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, as Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi>
  does not plainly prove it to be) among the rest the Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership of
  infants.</p>
               <p>His 19. <hi>plain Scripture-lesse proof is this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If God be not more prone to severity then to mercy, then he
  will admit of infants to be members of the visible Church but God &amp;c.
  therefore &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh the wit of this man how wonderfully doth it work, and wind to
  and fro, and wander far and neer to fetch in any manner of fewell, wherewith to
  feed that false faith men live in, concerning infant baptism, for fear it
  should be quite extinguished, and brought to nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ex nihilo nihil fit</hi> in an ordinary way, but such is the
  extraordinary eagerness of Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> to have the game go his way, by
  either fair play or foul, that he is wise to extract something out of any
  thing, and any thing out of just nothing to his purpose: this that God is not
  more prone to severity then mercy, may serve, and that soundly to make against
  those that say God is willing to save but a few, and did peremptorily determine
  to damn personally an 100 men to one before they were born, and that without
  reference to their foreseen rejection of his grace, but how it seems to make a
  jot against such as suppose the salvation of all dying infants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying onely
  infants meer membership in meer gospell fellowship, I must professe my self too
  shallow to conceive, yea I am astonisht, saving that the word tells me the
  seers must be blinded for teaching Gods fear after mens precepts, that the the
  ministers should buzze such a businesse abroad in print <hi>viz.</hi> that if
  infants be not now Church-members, then God is more prone to severity then to
  mercy, and then back it so baldly too as Mr. Ba. does: it is evident thus saith
  he <hi>God hath cut off multitudes of wicked mens infants both from the Church,
  and from life for the sins of their progenitors</hi> viz. Dathan <hi>and</hi>
  Abirams, Achans, Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecks, <hi>the</hi> Midianites, Daniels <hi>accusers,
  the</hi> Hittites, Amori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>es,
  Canaanites, Perrezites, <hi>and</hi> Jebusites, <hi>therefore if he should not
  admit of some infants of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men so much as to the visible Church,</hi>
  then he <hi>should be more prone to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then to mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot but inwardly blush at Mr. <hi>Bas.</hi> blindnesse, as
  if God had no way whereby to vindicate the honour of his mercy, and clear
  himself from the censure of more severe then merciful, but one, that is by
  giving commission to us, which yet he no where gives us in any part of his will
  and Testament, to baptize and inchurch some infants: as if he had no way to
  recover to his credit again to his most merciful name of the <hi>Lord,
  mercifull, gracious, and slow to anger</hi> since his cutting off so many
  infants together with their wicked parents by meer temporal death, and to make
  amends as it were for all the slaughters, that he made of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent infants,
  with their rebellious fathers in the daies of the law, unlesse in liew thereof
  he grant some infants of faithful men to be members of his visible Churches,
  and in visible fellowship with them in the daies and ages of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>
               <p>Who sees not the weaknesse, the wretchednesse of this
  consequence? yet so it is with Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> that God is more prone to
  severity then mercy if he now admit no infants into the visible Church under
  the Gospel, except saith he, it be proved that God giveth them some greater
  mercy out of the Church. To which excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his I say thus.</p>
               <p>First, it need not be proved, and yet his consequence will prove
  false, for if the <pb n="439" facs="tcp:42067:224"/> meer admitting of some faithful mens
  infants into the visible Church will so make up the matter as to salve God from
  censure of pronesse to severity, rather then mercy, and magnifie his mercy so
  as to make it appear to be that he delights in more then judgement,
  notwithstanding his severity in slaying so many infants with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, then
  God magnfied his mercy in that kind of way sufficiently to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for
  that severity in the very time of the law it self, forasmuch as then he did
  admit for 2000 years together not onely some infants of faithfull men, but in
  all that time innumerable infants of unfaithful and wicked men (for such were
  the Jewes for the most part in their several generations and yet such infants
  your selves would not now have admitted) to stand in the visible and national
  Church of the Jewes. And so there is no need of any admittance of infants now,
  in order to such an end as satisfaction for his severity to some infants of
  old, into visible fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with Gospel Churches.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to satisfie him further it may easily be proved that
  God giveth infants, if they die in their infancy unbaptized and not inchurched
  (for if they live to years they may be baptized all, and inchurched too, if
  they believe) a greater mercy then that of meer church-membership here on
  earth, for they having never committed any actuall sins whereby to deserve
  exemption, charity teaches us to believe, and hope thus much saies the
  <hi>Ashford</hi> Pamphlet of all such, that of <hi>such is the kindom of
  heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One thing more I cannot but take notice of in this passage not
  in way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> but in way of discovery how
  contradictory unto him some of his brethren are, who mannage the same cause
  with him, that they may either close more handsomely together, or else excuse
  us if we believe none of them till they be agreed more among themselves, for
  whereas Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> layes it down as the manner of old that when the
  parents sinned and broke Gods covenant so as to deserve to be discovenanted
  thereupon, the children that had right to stand by the <hi>Quondam</hi>
  membership of their parents, were wont to be discovenanted, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churched, and
  sometimes destroyed with them;</p>
               <p>I find the fornamed Dr. <hi>Channell</hi> of another mind, for
  when in a second pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique discourse with him at <hi>Petworth</hi> on
  <hi>Ianuary</hi> 5. 1651. I asserted his practise to be contradictory to his
  own judgement, forasmuch as his judgement was that believers infants onely were
  in covenant with God, and in right to Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership and baptism, and yet
  his practise to baptize all or most of the infants in his parish, not one of
  many of whose parents he judged to be believers, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his refusing
  communion with them for many years together in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</p>
               <p>He gave answer to this purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> that the parent,
  i. e. believing (or else the child hath no right <hi>secundum te</hi> O
  Presbyter) may sin himself out of covenant again, out of all communion in the
  Church, and be damned, and yet the child stand still in right to baptism and
  membership which he had by the faith of those parents; which as it thwarts the
  wonted wayof discovenanting, dischurching of children with the parents, so it
  contradicts himself more another way, though he evade his first contradiction
  by it, to say that believing parents (for such one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say your selves give
  right to their infants to be baptized) may sinne themselves out of covenant,
  and be damned, for though as I then told him he preached it in saying thus, yet
  I am perswaded he holds no falling from grace.</p>
               <p>More things I take notice that that Dr. and Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi>
  knock heads in, but I spare to do more then advise them to accord better with
  each other, but specially each of them with himself, or else as implicitly as
  men have believed them hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they will try them ere long, and scarce
  trust them any longer.</p>
               <p>His 20 <hi>Plain Scripture-lesse proof for infant
  churchmembership and baptism</hi> he <hi>drawes</hi> as he saies from Deut. 28.
  4. 18 32. 41. <hi>blessed shall they be in the <pb n="440" facs="tcp:42067:225"/> fruit of

  drawes it, for theres no such thing as he draws flowes freely from that or any
  other Scripture he produces, he drawes indeed, but at such a distance, that I
  see nothing followes from thence at all: he does not fall flatly upon it, nor
  deal down rightly with the text alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor doth he interpret the blessing

  <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, were then the Churches children, howbeit I say any one
  that is not willing to be wise above what is written, and to have vision of
  more then is visible, would rest in this, yet sith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will put us
  positivly to prove a third state, denying that theres any <hi>medium</hi>
  asserting that infants, if they be not in the visible Church of Christ in their
  infancy, are in the visible kingdome of the devil, which to say is false
  doctrine, I shall bring Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> to stop the mouth of Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> and to convince him that either there is a third state, in
  which believers infants are in their infancy, which is neither of these two, or
  else to drive him to that <hi>Dilemma,</hi> to preach this false doctrine
  him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self that believers infants are in the visible kingdome of the Devil.</p>
               <p>To this purpose I first demand of him, which of these two viz.
  the visible church of Christ or the visible kingdome of the devil believers
  infants are visibly in before baptism?</p>
               <p>First as for the visible kingdom of the devil he must say they
  are either visibly in it or out of it, if he say they are in it, then he
  himself preaches that false doctrine, which he saies is ours, and makes all
  infants, even of believers members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible kingdom of the devil; if he
  say they are out, and not in the visible kingdom of the devil, then that
  doctrine, which teaches men to leave them unbaptized, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies them to be
  admitted members of the visible church of Christ till they come to age, is not
  guilty as he saies it is, of making them doctrinally members of the visible 
  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:42067:226"/> kingdome of the devil, for it is but a delay indeed till
  they can do what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to baptism.</p>
               <p>As for the visible Church of Christ he must say they are either
  visibly in it before baptism, or not in but out of it, if he say they are in
  the visible church of Christ vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly before baptism, then they cannot be said
  to be (as oh how oft ore and ore again are they said to be by Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi>
  p. 24. 25.?) admitted to be members, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, listed, added, initiated into it
  as into Christs School, and first stated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it by baptism, for to be first
  entered into it by baptism, and yet to be visibly in it before baptism, these
  two are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> utterly inconsistent each with other, as to be let
  into a room when, and while one is already in the room is impossible, yet with
  Mr. B. persons are let into the visible church after they are in it, yea they
  must be in it, saith he, before they may be admitted to be in it, nor will his
  dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of a member compleat and incompleat p. 24. which he used before to
  the tearm disciple, which I know he will make, help him at all here, sith with
  him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an incompleat member is one that hath but <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> not
  <hi>in re, ad Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam,</hi> not <hi>in Ecclesia</hi> a right to onely, not a
  standing in the Church, a title to the relative change, and not a being yet in
  that relative change, that he saies passes upon him by baptism.</p>
               <p>Besides, to say the truth they are but incompleat members after
  baptism, whom you baptize, sith when baptized and in the church they have not
  present right to other ordinances of the church, for you admit not your infant
  members to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: but if he say they are not visibly in the church of
  Christ before baptism, but out of it, as indeed they are, then either he must
  say they are in the visible King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the devil, which is false doctrine
  with himself to say of believers infants, or else say they are in some third or
  middle state, to the unsaying of what he said before by way of denial of such a
  third state, which let him say, and we will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with him, and such a third
  state there is, which all infants are in as well as some, whether he will deny
  himself so as to acknowledge it yea, or no.</p>
               <p>His 22. plain <hi>Scripture-less</hi> proof for infant
  Church-membership and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism is this <hi>viz. That doctrine which leaveth us
  no sound grounded hope of the justification or salvation of any dying infant in
  the world, is certainly false doctrine, but that doctrine which denieth any
  infants to be members of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church doth leave us no &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This argument I have spoken to sufficiently above, and thereupon
  might well passe it by here, and refer Mr. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> thither for an answer, where in answer to the
  <hi>Ashford</hi> Disputants, that urge the same argument, enough to satisfie is
  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;</p>
               <p>But finding this to be that which of all things most gravels Mr.
  <hi>Baxter</hi> and makes him stick so stiffly to his plea for the baptism, and
  Church-membership of infants, because unlesse that be owned he can find no good
  ground in all the word whereupon to hope or believe that any dying infant in
  all the world can be saved, which if he could find, he would find the vanity of
  his venting so much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a necessity of baptizing, and inchurching
  infants, and save himself a deal of puzzling himself about that, which the New
  Testament hath not one word of, and fearing lest I should be judged cowardly to
  slide by it, as if I saw Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> handled it more unanswerably then any
  other, and partly because Mr. <hi>Ts.</hi> suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his judgement
  concerning the future state of any infants is puft at by him, and uneffectual
  to his satisfaction, unlesse he could assure him of the salvation of some dying
  infants, at least of believing parents, which if he could assure him of out of
  the way of their church-membership and baptism, it should satisfie him
  sufficiently, I perceive, to censure all other infants to hell, and to say all
  those millions of poor innocents, I mean the dying infants of other men, in
  respect of which these he is so pittiful to are scarce one of a 100. are all
  damned for ever, <pb n="443" facs="tcp:42067:226"/> with which harsh, cruel, bloody and
  mercilesse censure of his I am much more, and more groundedly dissatisfied,
  then he is about the denial of meer outward member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and bare ordinance of
  baptism to those few, on whose behalf he pleads them, and lastly hoping the
  Lord may lend him some ligh: whereby to see a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency between the non
  membership and baptism of believers infants, and the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the dying
  infants of, not believers onely, but all dying innocent infants in the world, I
  shall enter on an examination of what he saies to the contrary, and an
  explication of what apprehension in this particular I am begotten to by the
  word of truth, and though I shall decline <hi>sacerdotale delirium</hi> that
  common stock of divinity, which the Clergy have treasured up in their
  Theological Systems, out of which ocean of error, and dead sea of tradition the
  younger <hi>Rabbies</hi> use to draw into their common place books, and store
  themselves with arguments against Anab aptistical heresie, i. e. this trouble
  some truth, yet I trust I shall give a good account before all the world at the
  Tribunal of Christ Jesus.</p>
               <p>In order hereunto therefore I first flatly deny the
  <hi>Minor</hi> of Mr. <hi>Bas.</hi> above ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted syllogism, which by another
  Syllogism he proves viz. <hi>They that are not so much as seemingly or visibly
  in a state of salvation, of them so dying we can have no ground of Christian
  hope that they shall be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they that are not so much as seemingly or visibly of the
  Church, are not so much as seemingly or visibly in a state of salvation,
  therefore of them so dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we can have no true ground of hope that they shall
  be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Major</hi> of this second syllogism, which he sets
  himself to prove, I freely grant to be true.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I have many things to say to;</p>
               <p>First, I take notice how he changes the termes from what they
  were in this pro-syllogism, which, had he been minded to deal fairly, and not
  to sophisticate and shuffle, I know not why he should do, and a sincere
  disputant whould not have done it.</p>
               <p>In the Minor of the former syllogism the terms were thus
  <hi>viz.</hi> that doctrine that denieth infants to be members of the
  <hi>visible</hi> church, but here he writes, leaving out the word
  <hi>visible,</hi> foisting in the word <hi>seemingly</hi> and <hi>visibly</hi>
  to fill up the room of it, that it might not be mist, they that are not
  <hi>seemingly</hi> or <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> of the Church, whereas he ought of
  right to have brought in the <hi>Minor,</hi> and conclusion thus <hi>viz.</hi>
  but they that are not members of the <hi>visible</hi> Church, are not so much
  as seemingly or visibly in a state of salvation, therefore of them
  <hi>viz.</hi> them that are not members of the <hi>visible</hi> Church, we can
  have no true ground of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian hope that they can be saved, I say he should
  have exprest it <hi>visible</hi> Church in both places, else the word
  <hi>Church</hi> being understood by Mr. <hi>Ba,</hi> for the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church
  sometimes, i, e. them that are not onely seemingly sincere, and in state of
  salvation, but as really and truly in state of salvation as they seem, by this
  variation of his from visible Church to Church without the term visible the
  state of the question may be changed: and how beit he premises this and takes
  it for granted that to be a visible member of the church, and to be a member of
  the visible Church is all one, saying he that denies that will shew but his
  vanity, yet he takes it before it is granted him from me, who am one of those
  vain ones, that by his favour deny these to be all one, unlesse by the word
  Church in both places he means the <hi>visible</hi> Church, which though I do
  notsay he doth not, yet I say if he do, he should by right have exprest it, or
  else there may be fallacy in it, for I aver to Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> and albeit I
  seem to him to speak paradoxes, and parables thorow the distance of our
  principles, yet I hope to make it clear to his conscience, that the visible
  Church doth not so contain the invisible in it, as he saies it doth p. 75. but
  that there are cases wherein persons may be both real and visible i. e. to us
  seeming members of the invisible Church, or mistical body of sincere ones, and
  in state of salvation, and yet not be real members of the visible Church; or
  else <pb n="444" facs="tcp:42067:227"/> (not to speak now of the state of believers
  infants, whom you rantize, before you rantize them) let him tell me what
  visible state believers themselves, whom onely, and not their infants

                  </gap>ized, were in immediatly before they baptized them?
  they were not visibly members, after profession of their faith, of the visible
  Kingdom of the devil, and therefore at least visible and seeming members of
  Christs mistical body, and of the invisible Church, and in state of salvation,
  and yet were they not members visibly of the visible Church of Christ till
  (though I hold not baptism it self neither to be the immediate formal entrance
  into the visible Church, yet necessarily previous to it) till I say they were
  (to use Mr. <hi>Bas.</hi> own phrase by baptism admitted, and stated in it: for
  to be admitted to be a member of the visible Church, and yet to be a member of
  that visible Church before that admittance are utterly inconsistent each with
  other, yea to enter in by baptism, and yet to be in before baptism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the
  contradiction that is in one of these to the other, it makes your baptism,
  which you call the sacrament of visible entrance, to be what you say the supper
  is, i. e. a sacrament rather of continuance: to be seemingly therefore and
  visibly a member, or to be a visible member of the church, unlesse we mean the
  visible Church, (and then it ought to be so exprest by them that hold there is
  an invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) and to be a member of the visible Church are not all one: thus
  having first justly faulted the Minor for its fallacious faultring in the
  terms, and form of it, and varying from those of the first syllogisme and
  setting down the syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme in the plain termes in which Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>
  should have done it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that are not so much as seemingly or visibly in the state
  of salvation, of them so dying we can have no true ground of Christian hope
  that they shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>But they that are not members of the <hi>visible</hi> Church,
  are not so much as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly or visibly in a state of salvation, therefore of
  them that are not members of the <hi>visible</hi> Church, so dying we can have
  no true ground of Christian hope that they shall be saved.</p>
               <p>In the second place I fault the Minor of this argument as most
  false and unsound in the matter of it, and therefore I lay down this for truth,
  which is directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to it <hi>viz.</hi> that they that are not members
  of the visible Church may be seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and visibly in a state of salvation,
  and so consequently that of them that are not members of the visible Church so
  dying, we may have true ground of Christian hope that they shall be saved.</p>
               <p>These two positions with the consequence thereof are so
  contradictory each to other, that if this latter be truth then the former
  universally understood i. e. of all that are not of the visible Church, as it
  must be, or else it serves not Mr. <hi>Ba<hi rend="sup">s</hi>
                  </hi> purpose, must needs be false:
  whereupon I need do no more toward the disproof of his then to prove my own, in
  order to which I shall premise what the visible Church is, and then examine
  whether it be not possible for some persons as Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> it seems thinks
  it is not, to be seemingly and visibly in a state of salvation, and yet not be
  members of the visible Church.</p>
               <p>The true visible Church now in the times of the Gospel, and so
  onely it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns our purpose to consider of it, is <hi>all those severall
  particular visible assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and societies of persons in the world, or
  visible disciples collectively taken, which in all places and ages since Christ
  past, present and to come, being first separated, or called out of the world to
  personall prosession of repentance from dead works, and faith towards God, of
  remission of sins by Christ Iesus, of resurrection of the dead, and the
  eternall judgement, and baptized in water in the name of Christ for remission
  of sins, and together with imposition of hands, prayed for, that they may
  receive the holy spirit of promise, do afterward conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue stedfastly in the
  doctrine of the Apostles, and in fellowship, and in breaking 
  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:42067:227"/> of bread and prayers:</hi> all the true universall
  visible Church that I know of, if you will needs have an universal visible is
  that which doth exist in these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular visible societies, and is neither
  narrower nor wider then these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>Such was the visible Gospel Church in the primitive times, and
  the same and no other then that which was the visible Church then is the
  visible Church now, and in all times of the Gospell, wherein it is at all: the
  visible Church was that which did consist and was made up of all the particular
  Churches that then were <hi>viz. Rome, Corinth,</hi> and all the rest, which
  were societies and assemblies of persons thus called, gathered and built up an
  house unto God, upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the first principles of the doctrine of

  actually admitted to visible fellowship with them in breaking of bread and

  e. professing to believe what of it was matter of faith, and visibly practising
  what of it was practical, were visible disciples, new born babes <hi>Heb.</hi>

               <p>As for that Catholique visible church, I mean that voluminous

               <p>For as believers are the immediate matter for, or in immediate

  the immediate subject, i. e. in immediate right to be admitted, yet neither are
  baptized believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers actuall members till admitted, the formality and most
  immediate entrance, and way of becoming a visible member of a particular
  visible Church, and so consequently of the generall visible (if I may so call
  it) which hath its existence in all the particular churches, which are the
  immediate matter, of which that is made up, being not simply the act of
  baptism, but the act of joining our selves after it <hi>Act</hi> 9. 26. and the
  constitutive form of a visible Church is not their being all baptized, but
  their free falling into fellowship with each other, and though we are said to
  be all baptized into one body, tis an expression of the necessity only of every
  ones being baptized in order to a being in the visible Church, for none hath
  right to be of the visible body unbaptized, but though the baptized have
  imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate right to be of the body, yet are they not meerly of it because
  baptized, till added to it, and as one cannot be said to be actually under
  baptism, from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate right to it by faith, till he have submitted, so
  neither can we be said to be actually in the body from our immediate right to
  it by baptism, till we are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>Self condemned sinners have a right to believe in Christ,
  believers a right to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, baptized believers a right to the spirit of
  promise &amp; to have hands laid on with prayer, that they may receive it
  according to the promise <hi>Asts 2. Acts 8. Acts 19.</hi> such as these to
  fellowship in the visible Church, yet not in fellowship till, assaying to join
  themselves, they are accepted, and yet in a visible state of salvation too both
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptized, as the thief, and after baptized before added to the, Church
  visible, as the Eunuch, who both were seemingly members of the invisible
  Church, and yet then when converted and baptized, neither one nor the other as
  yet actual members of the visible: stones though never so unhewn and ragged are
  remote matter, hewn and polished stones immediate and fit matter for a
  building, yet not a building, till built together; many sheep are fit matter to
  make a flock, yet not formally a flock till they come neer together.</p>
               <p>Christs visible church is Christs flock, Gods house, Temple,
  building, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sheep, and single disciples, that hear his voice, believe in
  him, and are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into his name for remission of sins, are pecious
  materials, and in <hi>potentiâ proximâ</hi> thereunto, yet be they
  never so many of them, not visibly, actually, nor formally a flock, an house, a

               <p>Mr. B. shall be no Champion of my choosing to mannage the matter
  against the non-churchers of these times, for all he flourishes his sword so
  against them at the end of his book, if he plead the cause of them so, that sit
  down satisfyed in single fellowship between God and themselves onely, living up
  with him in the spirit, contenting themselves to believe onely, and renouncing
  all ordinances, forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the assembling of themselves together, and all
  fellowship in breaking of bread and prayers; if he grant the denomination of
  the true visible Church to such as these, as well as to those that continue
  stedfast in the Apostles doctrine, and in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <pb n="447" facs="tcp:42067:228"/> in
  breaking bread and prayers: yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi> does not yet agree with me in
  this that the particular assemblies collectively taken are the only visible
  Church, for indeed he is aware that it overturns all his visibilities from the
  bottom, and layes this foundation of no salvation for infants without the
  visible Church, on which he frames his present Argument, flat on the ground, to
  allow the bounds of the visible Church to be no broader then all the particular
  visible societies that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually baptized, and in formal fellowship in
  breaking bread and prayers, so as to say he is no member of the visible Church,
  that is not actually entred, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly stated in some particular
  congregation or other; therefore being politick, he premises this among the
  rest.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>You must understand,</hi> saith he (but a man may
  understand a little better if he will) <hi>that to be a member of the visible
  Church is not to be a Member of any particular, or politick body or
  society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay more to make his own matter good, and that he may find out a
  way of his own, whereby to hope well of all the infants of believers before
  baptism, that they may be saved (for let all other dying infants damn for him,
  he cares not for harbouring any hope of them) and finding no way but one,
  whereby to help himself to any hope of those, i. e. by feigning them to be of
  the visible church, he fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the visible church so far, that he makes it
  larger then the number of visible baptized ones, and holds all believers
  infants to be in the visible Church from the womb, and though in the last page
  but two of his book he disputes against twice entring into the visible body; he
  feigns them to enter first into the visible church, when they first enter into
  the world, besides and before their second first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the visible
  Church by baptism: I wonder whether he hold those belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers infants to be of
  the visible Church or no, that were once alive yet dy again in the womb?</p>
               <p>But for all these flim-flames, Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> will once know I
  hope that the true visible church is no other, then all those particular
  politicall assemblies, in whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
  baptized believers hold fellowship together, and that to be a member of the
  visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church is to be a member of some political society (or else how can
  such be ruld, admonisht, complained on to the church as <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and
  excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if need be, in case of obstinacy, if under no Ecclesiasticall
  Government?) and yet to hope well of the salvation of all infants that dy in
  infancy too without either baptism or visible membership in those visible
  societies.</p>
               <p>And if he will not agree with me about it, that the visible
  church is all the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble assemblies of Christians onely, will he agree with
  Dr. <hi>Featley,</hi> who defines the true visible church to be <hi>where the
  word is truly taught, and the sacraments duly administred?</hi> where therefore
  neither word is taught, nor sacraments at all administred, as to unbaptized
  infants I judge they are not, nor baptized infants neither, theres no visible
  church;</p>
               <p>Again, the universal visible church, that is saith he, <hi>all
  the assemblies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the world,</hi> the visible church and all the
  assemblies are adaequate with him, at least therefore unbaptized infants cannot
  be of it, for they were never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the assemblies; but if Mr.
  <hi>Ba.</hi> will agree with neither of us, we shall perswade him I hope to
  agree in this with Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> for nowbeit Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> will needs
  reckon upon the very unbaptized infants of believers as not in right to the
  visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church onely, but of it, in it, visible members of it as as soon as
  born (for let him study his own book, how oft does he beat upon that, saying,
  there is but two states for them to be in, or members of the visible kingdome
  of the devil, or the visible church of Christ, but believers infants before
  baptism are not in the first, therefore in the visible church of Christ?)
  though I say he speak of them as in the visible church before baptism, as not
  knowing else how to hope their salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they dy without it, yet if any
  man living do deny infants, or any other to be of or in the visible church
  before or without baptism, Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> denies it, with 
  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:42067:229"/> whom how often is it exprest that baptism is the first
  visible entrance into it?</p>
               <p>Yea (to say nothing of his own definition of the visible church,
  p. 75. to be such as <hi>were baptized and continued together in fellowship in
  breaking broad and prayers,</hi> which ought to conclude the whole church so,
  defined unlesse he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined it by the halves) in his plea for the
  continuance of baptism against the seekers p. 342. 343. he saies so, and saies
  moreover that we must not admit any to be of the body without it, that it is
  the <hi>appointed ordinary way of ingrafting all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body that are
  ingrafted,</hi> and p. 24. 25. he saies <hi>baptism still is to be at and not
  after persons are stated in the Church, at and not after our admission, at and
  not after our igrafting and entrance into the visible Church,</hi> making
  baptism and our first being in or of the visible church so simultaneous, that
  we may not, must not be supposed to be in, to be of, to be visibly members of
  the visible church before baptism, which if it be true, as indeed it is, that
  none can be counted to the body, as one of it, though in never such right to it
  first, before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism ordinarily, at least as he pleads, how doth all this
  hang together, and agree with what he pleads here and in the foregoing argument
  p. 71. where he saith <hi>it is not the deniall of baptism directly that
  leaveth infants in the visible kingdom of the devill?</hi> I would every one,
  and Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> himself would consider this grant of Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> for
  then, what ever necessity there may be of supposing them, as he doth, to be
  visible members in infancy, and even before they are baptized, we can suppose
  them in as good a state as he, yet at least there will be no need to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
  them, whereby to put us into more hopes of their salvation if they dy in
  infancy, for if I can hope the salvation of some believers infants that die
  without Baptism, upon that account, what ere tis, I may as well hope the
  salvation of them all dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Baptism, and so save the frivolous pains
  of baptizing infants at all, he goes on thus, tis true saith he, that <hi>many
  unbaptized are in the Kingdome of Christ,</hi> meaning his visible church, but
  no man who is known to be out of Christs visible church ordinarily can be out
  of Satans visible kingdome: I say how do these things square? hear what he
  saies, no entring into or being in the visible Church, but by baptism, and yet
  many unbaptized are in the visible Church <hi>viz.</hi> all believers infants
  before baptism <hi>viz.</hi> from the womb.</p>
               <p>Either Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> must hold two first entrances into the
  visible church <hi>viz.</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural birth and baptism, or else he must hold
  that baptism is not the first entrance, or else that believers infants are not
  entred, and if not so, not in the visible church before baptism, whether they
  have right to be so or no, which is another questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if he chuse to say the
  first, then he contradicts what he saies of entring the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church p. 343.
  if the 2d. he contradicts all he saies of baptisms being the onely entrance; if
  the 3d. that believers infants are not entred, and so not in not visibly of the
  visible church before baptism, then of these two things he must say one
  <hi>viz.</hi> either that all the infants of believers that dy before their
  visible entrance into the visible church by baptism are damned without hope,
  which he neither will nor can say, or else say that there is hope of dying
  infants salvation, and that they may be seemingly and visibly in a state of
  saluation, and yet not be visible members of the visible church, and then what
  need any further witnesse or disproof? for heel confute the <hi>Minor</hi> out
  of his own mouth, which I am to disprove, and save me the labour.</p>
               <p>For if they may be in a visible state of salvation and yet not
  be visibly in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible church; then tis so, and theres an end.</p>
               <p>If to all this he saies that he meanes not more, but that
  believers infants before baptism have right to be baptized, and to be of it,
  and to deny them that right to it denies them salvation, I deny that infants
  dying without right to be of the visible Gospel church denies them to be in
  state of salvation, and shall shew <pb n="449" facs="tcp:42067:229"/> the contrary,
  neverthelesse Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> might have spoken more properly, and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
  then to call a right to visible membership by the name of visible member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
  it self, as he often, yea all along does, therefore we might wish him to mend
  his <hi>Minor</hi> before we meddle with it, and also he must confesse to the
  contradiction of himself, that there is a third state betwen the visible church
  of Christ, and the visible kingdom of the devil, in which infants must be
  sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be by himself <hi>viz</hi> a right to the church, but not a
  present standing in it, which kind of right and middle state I acknowledge
  unbaptized believers to have, but as for infants, though they are in a present
  visible state of, and right to salvation as well as they, unlesse living longer
  they reject Gods grace afresh which dying infants cannot do, and so not in the
  visible Kingdome of the devil, yet are they neither in, nor yet in immediate
  right to the visible Church as men and women of years not yet baptized and yet
  believing are, but in <hi>medio abnegationis</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them, these
  things premised, I come now to the disproof of his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> in which
  ile take him in a fairer sense for himself then he expresses himself in, and
  yet make no question but to disprove it, in contradistinction unto which I say
  down my self thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> That not only some men may be <hi>de facto</hi> no
  members, but all infants <hi>de jure</hi> in no right to membership in the
  visible Church of Christ under the Gospell, and yet both be possibly in state
  of salvation.</p>
               <p>Now how far forth <hi>de facto</hi> persons may be out of an
  actual standing in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible church, and yet in a visible state of
  salvation, ile not meddle much to examine, because the question is (though Mr.
  <hi>B.</hi> does not so fairly expresse it, but I take it in the way that is
  most to his advantage) whether denyal of the <hi>jus</hi> this imediate right
  to membership excludes them not from salvation? yet thus much I shall say to
  that <hi>viz.</hi> if persons must be seemingly, and visibly in state of
  salvation, before they are to be admitted members, they may be as yet no
  members of the visible church <hi>de facto,</hi> and yet in a visible state of
  salvation.</p>
               <p>This is evident not only by the singular case of the theif, who
  never was actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted into the visible Church, nor so much as baptized
  at all for want of opportunity, and yet in a visible state of salvation, but
  also if we instance in all others that ever we read were baptized in the
  primitive times, who were first seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and visibly in a state of
  repentance, faith and disposition to obey Christ in all things, and therefore
  in a visible state of salvation <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. and then after this added
  to the church <hi>Mvt. 3. Mark. 16. 16. Act. 2. Act. 8. Act. 16. Act.</hi> 18.
  for a certain remote, and conditional right all persons have; thus <hi>de
  facto:</hi> and now <hi>de jure</hi> that the denyal of persons present and
  immediate right to member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the visible church doth not deny them
  universally to be in a visible state of salvation is evident also thus,
  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If some persons both men and infants may appear to us to be
  in state of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet not in immediate present right to be joined to
  the visible Church, then the denyal of persons present and immediate right to
  membership in the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church does not universally deny them to be in a
  visible state of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But some persons, yea both men and infants, may appear to us
  to be in a state of salvation, and yet at the same time not be in so much as
  immediate and present right to be joined to the visible Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first proposition is most clear, the second I shall make as
  cleer.</p>
               <p>First, briefly concerning men,</p>
               <p>Secondly, More largely concerning infants, because the question

  before visible right to membership in the visible church.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> supposes persons must be first supposed to be

  be taken to be of the visible.</hi> In order of time therefore persons were to
  seem to be members of the invisible church, and were visibly in a state of
  salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion first before they could have any right at all so much as to be
  baptized, which with Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> himself was the first entrance into
  membership in the visible church, but with me is not so much as an immediate
  entrance into it, but that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to go before it, therefore
  persons may be seemingly in a state of salvation, and not yet in present right
  to membership in the visible Church, much lesse actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and visibly in

               <p>First, because <hi>it is the body that Christ is the Saviour of,
  and his people that he redeemeth from their sins, and his sheep to whom he
  gives eternal life, and those that sleep in Iesus that God will bring with him,
  and the dead in Christ that shall rise to salvation, and those that die in the
  Lord that rest from their labours and the Church that Christ will present pure
  and unspo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ed,</hi> all which
  places I appeal to Mr. <hi>Bas.</hi> conscience whether they speak not of the
  misticall body, and invisible church of Christ, to which all and onely they
  square, and are adaequate, and not to the visible Church, which he was to speak
  to, or else speaks nothing to the purpose, to all which visible church, and to
  onely which these things agree not, for neither all those that are of the
  visible churchare saved, nor <pb n="451" facs="tcp:42067:230"/> onely those of the visible
  Church saved, witnesse many infants of believers whom Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> dares
  not say are damned, some never living to enter the visible Church so farre as
  to baptism, and some, once alive, coming dead out of the womb, which he is
  blind that ever saw to be in the visible church, so that he sits here beside
  the sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>dle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, and Thirdly, because there is no divine revelation
  for the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any without the visible Church, that yields good ground
  of Christian faith, or hope that any such shall be saved,</hi> as
  notwithstanding he saies there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s
  not, yet I shall shew there is by and by.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, because it is said Acts the 2. 47. that God added
  to the visible church dayly such as should be saved,</hi> which though he did,
  yet twas not all nor onely such, but onely such men and women, not such
  infants, as should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Concerning infants in proof of the proposition above
  <hi>viz.</hi> that some infants may be in visible State of salvation, and yet
  not be in, nor yet in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent right to membership in the visible Church,</p>
               <p>I argue thus downrightly.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>if all infants are in infancy in a visible state of
  salvation, and no infants are members, or in any right to be members in their
  infancy of the visible church under the Gospel, then some infants may in
  infancy be in a visible state of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet not be in, nor yet in
  present right to membership in the visible church,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But all infants &amp;c. and no infants &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Ergo, some infants <hi>ut supra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first proposition is most undeniably clear, the
  <hi>Minor</hi> hath two parts, which I shall prove successively one ofter
  another, and then I have done with this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> Ile prove
  the last first, and the first last, and here I dare-say I might easily muster
  up scores, if not a century of solid arguments toward the fuller clearing of
  it, that no babes now, but the new born babes spoken of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2.
  3. 4. 5. i. e. at least in appearance spiritually born babes, such as those 1

  as no infant is, have right to dwell in this family, the babes, the seed of
  <hi>Abraham</hi> circumcised in heart, the children of the heavenly promise
  pointed at, and typed out by the Iews babes, and that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised seed of
  <hi>Isaac,</hi> and those children of that earthly promise of the old
  <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> these are the true sons of the free woman, the Gospel visible
  church, before whom the bond woman, and her son i. e. <hi>Abrahams</hi> meer
  fleshly seed, though by <hi>Isaac,</hi> are cast out, that they may dwell alone
  in the house, as <hi>Hagar</hi> and her son were cast out of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
  house of old before <hi>Isaac</hi> and his seed, that they might dwell alone,
  for look how <hi>Ishmael</hi> and his seed stood in reference to <hi>Isaac</hi>
  and his, that were the children by promise of the earthly <hi>Canaan viz.</hi>
  but servants that must not abide the house longer, when the other came in to

  servants that must be packing, when he comes in, and not abide in the house
  together with him see <hi>Iohn 8. Galatians</hi> 4. ult.</p>
               <p>But that were to begin the work again, which I have finisht
  above, where I <pb n="452" facs="tcp:42067:231"/> have given a touch of these things, and
  but a touch in comparison of what might be said; And of multiplying Arguments,
  and making many books there is no end.</p>
               <p>Therefore ile hint but a few, among which this shall be the
  first.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the standing upon the root Abraham, i. e. the family or
  visible Church of God since Christ be by faith in the person onely so standing,
  and not by faith in the parent, as of old, then infants cannot now stand
  therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But so tis,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The consequence is cleared by the consideration of the
  incapacity of infants to believe, faith being assent to something propounded to
  us, faith comming by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and hearing by the word <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. so
  that who so thinks it possible for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>credere</hi> when it is said how can they believe in him of whom they have
  not heard, is wretchedly inconsiderate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is evident out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. where it
  is said the very natural branches of <hi>Abrahams</hi> body, that did on that
  account meerly as the fleshly seed of that father of the faithfull stand in the
  olive tree, the visible Church, before time, yet now could stand no longer on
  that old account, why? were they not the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> still, that
  stood without faith in the old visible Church to the very end of it? yes, but
  they believed not in their own persons, therefore could not stand in this
  house, but were cast out of their own olive, their own father
  <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> family, i. e. the visible Church, now Christ came in,
  because of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and thou (saith <hi>Paul</hi> to the Gentile) standest,
  how? by fleshly descent? no, that standing is gone from such as come of
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> himself, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not to thee, nor to thine, but by
  faith, i. e. personal, and not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentall.</p>
               <p>A Second this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If all they that are baptized into one visible body under
  the Gospell are made in the supper to drink into one spirit, then infants, who
  cannot drink into one spirit with the body,</hi> secundum te <hi>may not be
  baptized into that visible body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this is true 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So Col. 2. 19. All the body is knit together, and by joints,
  and bands hath nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment ministred, and increaseth by that which every
  joint, and member sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth Eph.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But infants are not capable to have Spirituall nourishment
  Minstired, and to grow in grace, as all the body ought to do at least, and this
  in the use of the Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you say they are capable of spiritual nourishment, I say as
  capable I think as of the spiritual birth, for where theres a birth theres a
  growth, but then me thinks they should be as capable of the supper, which is
  the Sacrament of spirituall nourishment, being capable of that, as being
  capable of spiritual birth, they are of baptism the outward Sacrament of the
  same.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> denies that page 114. 115. among other
  reasons for this, because <hi>though capable to be washed, yet not to eat
  bread, and drink wine in their first infancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh strange! they may have it then as they can eat and drink.</p>
               <p>A third is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If no infants were baptized and added to the first Gospell
  visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, then surely they had no right so to be, for the Apostles would
  not do them that wrong as not to add them that had right,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this is true, <pb n="453" facs="tcp:42067:231"/> Therefore
  that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is plain out of <hi>Acts</hi> 2. where to the
  120. men and women that without infants continued in fellowship <hi>Acts</hi>
  1. there were added 3000. more in one day, and not one infant among them, but
  as many onely as gladly received the word, nor more nor lesse (for else
  <hi>Luke</hi> couzens us in his history) and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after their baptism in
  fellowship in breaking bread and prayers, which no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants did, and yet it is
  well nigh infallible, that those 3000 had some infants belonging to some of
  them, which would have been added with their parents, if <hi>the promise is to
  you, and to your children and them a far off, even as many as the Lord shall
  call</hi> would bear the sense divines drawes it to.</p>
               <p>Yea Master <hi>Cotton</hi> himself conceives that no infants
  were baptized at that time, and when else either these or any other were,
  neither I, nor any one else ever found, since they began to read Christs
  Testament with their eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p>Yea <hi>Peter</hi> commanded no more to be baptized but the same
  persons whom he speaks to also to repent, which me thinks he should have done,
  saying be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized every one of you, and baptize your children also, if any
  such thing had been intended, and Christians infants were to have been
  <hi>seperated out of the world, and called to be saints, and baptized,</hi> as
  Mr. <hi>B.</hi> believes they are to be, but not I.</p>
               <p>For what saies <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the
  <hi>Romans,</hi> chapter 1. I suppose he wrote not to infants, yet to all the
  called Saints, to all that be in <hi>Rome</hi> called to be saints.</p>
               <p>So in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. the 23. <hi>If the whole Church come
  together, and all speak with tongues, and all Prophe-y.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So 26. <hi>Every one of you hath a Psalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So 31. <hi>Ye may all prophecy one by ons that all may be
  edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>yed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He writes, and so surely he seems to me to do all his Epistles,
  to the whole church, and speaks to the whole body, yet I cannot conceive that
  to any infants, who are uncapable to be edifyed and comforted.</p>
               <p>Yea 1 Cor. 12. 25. 16. <hi>The Members of the visible body of
  Christ ought to have the same care one for another, so that if one Member
  suffer all the Members suffer with it, if one be honoured all rejoice with
  it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This cannot infants do,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore surely are not of this visible body of
  Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Argument which Master <hi>Baxter</hi> himself mentions,
  and slights, as simply supposing that it excludes infants from salvation, is
  that of Mr. <hi>Tombs viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the onely way now appointed by Christ to make visible
  church Members is by teaching the persons themselves, and that none else must
  be Members of the visible Church, but those that have learnt as infants have
  not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument is of great weight, and receives as trifling an
  answer from Mr. <hi>B</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>or
  saith he, <hi>then it will much more follow that they are not, or at least that
  we may not judge them to be of the invisible Church at all i. e.</hi> to be
  such as so dying shall be saved.</p>
               <p>The contrary to which, and inconsequence of which I have shewed
  above and shall shew more by and by.</p>
               <p>Secondly (saith he) If <hi>they may argue from Matth. the 28.
  20. that none, but those that are taught are true Disciples, and are to be
  baptized, why may they not as well Argue from Mark the 16. chap. 16. verse, who
  ever believeth not shall be damned, that all infants are certainly
  damned?</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:42067:232"/> To which I say first I am one, who argues

                  </gap> to learn, and I blush at that bald stuff, wherewith he
  strives, and streines his wits till he becomes ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, to make the
  denomination of disciple appear to be due to infants p. 23. as namely,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Because they are taken into Christs school and Kingdome, i.
  e. his visible Church,</hi> [whereas tis before persons are taken into this
  School that they are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples therefore not by it] <hi>also because they are
  not lesse docible then some bruits</hi> [as if some brutes are so docible as to
  deserve the name of disciples of Christ, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more infants]
  <hi>because Mothers, Nurses teach them by gesture, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and voice partly,
  and dishearten, and take them off from vices, and if not at first to know

  but no infants, could denominate disciples of Christ] <hi>because Christ can

  parents by action, and voice]</hi> [from which <hi>Christ can teach them</hi>
  to denominate believers infants disciples of Christ, before we have any
  evidence that he does teach them any more then other infants, that must be no
  disciples, when Christ can teach these as well as those I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive the

  a man, and his children those were children disciples of that Philosopher</hi>
  [as if ever any wise man did hire another wise man to teach him and his nine

               <p>Moreover <hi>Adhominem,</hi> as he saies of the word holy p. 82.

                  <hi>What Christ hath conjoined i. e. in his commission for
  baptizing that man <pb n="455" facs="tcp:42067:232"/> must not separate, i. e. in his
  practise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Christ hath conjoined our discipling persons and
  baptizing them in his commission, for baptizing, as a standing course to the
  end of the world as Mat. 28. 19. 200. shews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Erg no man must separate these two in his practise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> were alive to answer this he would
  happily say tis no Topical, but a Sophistical Syllogism, for when A. R. makes
  much what the like from <hi>Mar. 16. 16. viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What God hath joined together no man ought to
  separate,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But faith and baptism God hath joined together Acts</hi> 8.
  37.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo faith and baptism none ought to separate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He saies theres a double falacy in it <hi>viz. homonimiae,</hi>
  or ambiguity in the premises i, e. in the termes <hi>joined together,</hi> for
  it may be meant saith he, either <hi>in precepto,</hi> and that no man denyeth,
  or <hi>insubejcto</hi> the subject i. e. so as to say that all that are
  baptized have faith, and none have faith but the baptized, and in this sense it
  is apparently false saith he, whereupon to prevent Dr. <hi>Featleys</hi>
  fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers from charging the above syllogism with that fallacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have
  exprest in what sense I mean it, viz. <hi>in precepto,</hi> in which sense the
  premisses are granted to be true by the Dr. himself, and therefore I know
  no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> why they should be denied by
  Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> or any else, and then the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lusion must be true: but saith Dr. <hi>Feat.</hi> there is a
  fallacy called <hi>ignoratio elench<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> in the conclusion i. e. it concludes not the thing in
  question, but that which is not denied by us, for they that are for baptizing
  of infants, do not separate faith and baptism, for they baptize children into
  their fathers faith saith he;</p>
               <p>Secondly they believe that infants of believers receive some
  hidden grace of faith in time of their baptizing, his followers say before
  baptism p. 3. of their pamphlet (oh how contrary are they each to other)
  therefore are to be baptized; but Mr. Ba. will say none of all this I hope, for
  he is against Baptismal regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor will he charge the syllogism with
  sophistry I hope, but deny either the <hi>Major,</hi> or the <hi>Minor,</hi>
  either of which if he do, he answers his own grand ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against the
  seekers p. 341, where word for word (saving a term or two put in here for
  explication) this very syllogism is his own, or else he will grant both these,
  and consequently the conclusion to be true, and then why will he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
  baptism to persons i. e. infants, before they so much as seem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve?</p>
               <p>But it may be that which is a good syllogism, when used by
  himself, will be meer sophism with him too when urged by us:</p>
               <p>Secondly the reason why we may not argue that all infants are
  damned from <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. though they believe not, is this viz. because
  that place speaks of persons at years onely, to whom the Gospel is preached,
  and not of infants, that are not capable to believe.</p>
               <p>But then saies Mr. <hi>Ba. the same may be answered to the
  argument from Mat. 28. against infants being disciples, and to be
  baptized.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom I reply thus.</p>
               <p>First, if he saies (as we of <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.) of <hi>Mat.
  28. 20. viz.</hi> that <hi>go teach all nations baptizing them,</hi> is meant
  of men at years onely, and not of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, then he grants as much as we
  desire, and confesses that Christ, in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to teach and baptize the
  nations, do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s not mean discipling
  and baptizing infants, but men, and if the commission to baptize extend not to
  infants, as the subject, then what warrant to baptize them?</p>
               <p>Secondly if that place be meant of men onely, and not of
  infants, then Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> was well busied the while, when he brings that
  very place in the very front of his plain Scripture proofs, for his infant
  membership and baptism, its ill stumbling at the very threshold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:42067:233"/> But I shall not multiply, nor improve as
  Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> hath done to the utmost, but give one argument more against
  infant membership, and so come to the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If all that can be said in proof of the visible
  Church-membership of infants may be disproved as weak, and inconsequent utterly
  to that purpose, then sure there is enough, if one would stand upon it, to be
  brought against it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But all that is said by Mr. Ba. in his two dozen of
  arguments, who improves himself to the utmost to say as much as can be said in
  proof of the visible Church membership of infants, is well nigh already, and
  will be altogether by and by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as weak and inconsequent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo there must needs be enough against it: for
  contradictoriorum uno nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to statuitur, probatur alterum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If all, that can be said on one side to the proof of this that
  infants ought to be members of the visible Church, will not avail to evince
  that to be the truth, then that infants ought not to be members of the visible
  Church of Christ is a thing will prove it self well enough.</p>
               <p>And so I have done with one member of my proposition, that I may
  say a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle also to the other, which is this viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though no infants have right in infancy to be baptized and
  joined to the visihle Church, as I have already proved, yet all infants in
  their infancy are in a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble state of salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> finds out or rather fancies to himself certain
  grounds whereupon to hope, that some dying infants are saved <hi>viz.</hi> some
  of the dying infants of the faithful, as in opposition to all the dying infants
  of the wicked, I say some of them, for he dares not say p. 78. that his own
  grounds yield a certainty, though a probability, of the salvation of all such
  neither, so doth he narrow up the grace of God to that innocent age of infancy,
  for all he would seem so merciful as to plead its cause against those cruel
  conceits which he conceives are conceived of it amongst us, yet he finds no
  good ground whereupon to hope the salvation of the dying infant of any godly
  man, but the same on which he conceives them of nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to that salvation
  to have also a right to membership in the visible Church, but such a necessary
  dependance of them each on other, that suppose one to be no member, at least in
  no visible right to membership in the visible Church, of that person, so dying,
  there can be harboured no hope at all of his salvation: but what if I can make
  it good from one of those very grounds of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own bringing
  that theres a ground to hope the salvation of one such dying infant, as of whom
  it is most palpably evident, that it was neither actually a member of the
  visible Church before it died, nor so much as in any visible right to
  membership in the visible Church if it had lived? Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> will then I
  hope let go his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conceit of a necessity of dying infants membership in
  order to our having hopes of their salvation.</p>
               <p>And in order to the making good of this, I instance in the very
  same child, which himself brings in as his fifth ground page 77. and alludes
  to, as his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the contrary <hi>viz.</hi> the child that <hi>David</hi>
  had by <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> while she was yet the wife <hi>Uriah,</hi> of whom I
  testifie the very same that Mr. <hi>Bax.</hi> does <hi>viz.</hi> that
  <hi>Davids</hi> comforting himself concerning his dead child, because he should
  go to the child, but the child not return to him, was an evident argument that
  <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was confident that that child of his should not be damned, and
  yet he could not hope so upon any such account as his childs dying a member of
  the visible Church, for the child never lived so much as to the 8th day, nor to
  be circumcis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thereby entred into the visible Church, for its plain 2
  <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 18. that it died on the 7th. and if Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> say it
  was a member <hi>de jure,</hi> though not <hi>de facto</hi> i. e. in a right to
  have been a member had it lived, I deny that with as <pb n="457" facs="tcp:42067:233"/>
  much confidence as the other, for a bastard was not to be admitted into the
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Lord unto the tenth generation, and its evident that that
  child was a bastard.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore contrary to that round Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi>
  runs about in like a horse in a mill, making a necessary concatenation between
  being in visible right to Church-membership, and in a visible state of
  salvation, proving the one by the other, concluding sometimes, that infants of
  believers are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Gospel promise, &amp; so visibly in a state of
  salvation, &amp; therfore they must be baptized and in churcht, or else they
  could not, and others may not, sometimes that infants of believers are in
  visible right to be admitted into the visible Church, and therefore we may have
  sound ground to hope their salvation, so dying, as denying their right to
  membership we could not have, and of other infants we cannot, I conclude I say
  that there may be sound ground whereon to hope the salvation of some dying
  infants, that dye without actual membership in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or visible
  Church of Christ, and without any right to it also in their infancy had they
  lived longer.</p>
               <p>And if we may hope well of some infants that dy without
  membership, and without right to it also, I know not why we may not hope the
  like of all, for all Mr. <hi>Baxs.</hi> impropriating the unlimited and
  boundlesse grace of God, and ingros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all hope of the salvation of dying
  infants, to the dying infants of none but faithful parents, specially
  considering, besides what grounds more of my own I shall add in proof of it by
  and by, two more at least of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> own grounds whereon to hope
  the salvation of believers infants are grounds, whereon to hope the salvation
  of other dying infants as well as them, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he refers to for them
  speaking, if of infants at all, then of the whole <hi>species,</hi> of the
  whole kind of that Stature called infants, and not of infants of one kind more
  then another.</p>
               <p>For first whereas his 6th ground for the salvation of believers
  dying infants, and of being without any fear of their damnation is this
  <hi>viz.</hi> because it is said <hi>Psal. 127. 3. 4. 5. children are the
  heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb his reward</hi> &amp;c. if that
  be spoken of infants at all, as it seems rather to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of children that
  are grown up, that are the strength of their father and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, it is
  surely spoken of all infants as well as some, and he that particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes that
  indefinit term of children, and the fruit of the womb, where ever the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
  speaks hopefully of such, so as to understand it universally to expresse, and
  sound forth no more then those individualls <hi>viz.</hi> the seed of believing
  parents (and yet thus Mr. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> muzzles up all such Scriptures, and makes them sound no more
  then he would have them) doth little lesse then force the word to his
  ownfancy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas his 13th ground is from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 10.
  where he argues thus,</p>
               <p>If <hi>little ones have their angels beholding the face of God
  in heaven then they shall be saved, for that is a mercy peculiar to the people
  of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I argue that if little ones litterally taken (i. e. if infants
  be there meant, as he saies, but never shewes, they are (saving <hi>per
  alios</hi> and not <hi>per se)</hi> then surely all infants as well as some,
  for he speaks not there of the little ones of believing parents in special, but
  of what kind of little ones soever he speaks, he speaks of that kind of little
  ones in general without exception, whether it be of infants, or of his
  disciples, and if yet it must needs be understood of infants onely, that they
  shall be saved, it is understood universally of them, and so much Mr. Ba. might
  have seen, and would have said had he consulted the 14. verse, but just below
  where it is thus said of all little ones that are lost, and so of all as well
  as some, <hi>viz. it is not the will of your heavenly father that one of these
  little ones shall perish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And sith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> so <hi>suches</hi> it out below p. 104
  105. &amp;c. from <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 14. 15. saying that of <hi>such is the
  kingdome of Heaven</hi> must needs be meant, <hi>viz. by kingdome of Heaven
  salvation,</hi> which I grant, and by such (as ile grant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so 
  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:42067:234"/> at this time however, sith thence I shall have another
  Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> to give hope by of the salvation of all dying
  infants) not such as are like infants, but infants themselves, and that not of
  those individuals onely that were then brought, which whether they were
  children of believing parents or no too is more then Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ere can
  demonstrate, there being many that came to Christ for heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themselves or
  theirs, as tis most evident that these did, of whom not more then one of ten
  were as they should be, for of 10 leapers clensed where were the nine?</p>
               <p>I say not of those individuals onely, but of the very
  <hi>species</hi> of infants, yea how oft ore and ore and ore again does he
  inculcate this upon us in that place, saying, it was the <hi>species</hi> of
  infants, the very <hi>species,</hi> infants in <hi>specie,</hi> and not those
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, whom Christ saies the kingdome of heaven, i. e. salvation doth
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to, I appeal to Mr. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> own conscience, whether there be not out of his own mouth a
  strong Argument of hope, if not of assurance from Christ himself that the whole
  <hi>species</hi> of infants, so dying, i. e. all infants, and not some onely
  shall be saved: for the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>pecies</hi> of infants expresses not some infants onely but all
  infants, or infants <hi>quâ tales,</hi> so that <hi>quatenus ipsum</hi>
  evermore including <hi>de omni,</hi> whatver belongs to infants
  <hi>inspecie</hi> i. e. to the kind or to infants as suchbelongs toall infants,
  <hi>quod convenit homini,</hi> purely <hi>qua est homo, convenit omni
  homini</hi> and so what ever belongs to any thing, as tis such, belongs also to
  all that is such.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> teaches us the truth in this, that the
  kingdome of heaven and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion belongs by Revelation from Christ himself to
  infants, not in <hi>individuo</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, i. e. not to those infants onely
  that were then brought to Christ, nor any other, but to the kind, to infants
  <hi>in specie</hi> i. e. all infants as infants, therefore the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of
  heaven and salvation belongs to them all, and so did that kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to
  Christs person, while he was on earth, with infants, not for, nor by baptism,
  but for healing, belong to all infants that needed it as well as some, that
  were then on earth, as comming to Christ with infants by prayer to him to help
  and heal them, in whatever malady, since his person is absent, belongs to all
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the world, and not to believers infants onely; and yet not baptism,
  and a standing in fellowship in the visible Church, for they indeed are not fit
  for fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>Therefore though Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> contracts the grace of God to
  infants, as concerning their everlasting salvation into little a little corner,
  yea good lord how few dying infants does he hope shal be saved, that hath hope
  of none but of some i. e. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers infants, which are but one of many, and
  also not of all, but onely some of them? yet (to conclude this in a way of
  resemblance to Mr. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. conclusion
  of his Argument from <hi>Mark</hi> 10. p. 107.) I blesse the Lord Jesus Christ
  King of the Church, though he gave no order to baptize, and inchurch infants
  here on earth yet for having a greater tendernesse towards the eternal state of
  all dying infants, then Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is yet aware of, and towards all that
  live to years such a tendernesse as to invite them to himself universally, and
  bid them wel-come, and so great a care to inform his Chutch in his Word and
  Gospel concerning his good will to all men, and to all insants also in that
  particular, so as to speak it so plainly, that plain minded men, that are not
  minded never to change their minds, as I hope Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is not, may well
  see his mind in this case, even as if he had therefore done this, because he
  foresaw that some would arise so carnally, and so cruely conceited, as to
  suppose it impossible to be, and but in vain to hope it almost, that Gods
  saving mercy should extend to any more dying infants then those few, and not
  all those few neither, of their own: and for my part I gladly accept Christs
  information, and submit to his discovery, let them resist it that dare.</p>
               <p>And lastly, one more Argument of hope that I have within my self
  that all dying infants must needs be saved, is this yet, because I could never
  find since I lookt for it, as also none ever shall that look not without 
  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:42067:234"/> their eyes, what should, nor what (save the Priesthoods
  divine kind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) does damn them, I mean any of them so dying, any more
  then one of them.</p>
               <p>First as for sin, which onely damnes, I know none they have of
  their own, and to say that any infant dyes eternally for theiniquity of his
  father only, makes the word of God, which is truth it self, no better then a
  flat falsehood to me, who read in <hi>Ieremy 31. 29. 30. &amp; Ezek. 18. 3. 4.
  19. 20. &amp; Deut. 24. 16. &amp; 2 Kings</hi> 14. 16. that the waies of God
  who requires it strictly of man, not to put the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to death for the sins
  of the father, but every man only for his own sin, are so equal, for all the
  false accusation of him by the wicked Jewes, that seeing he both saies, and
  also swears it, that men shall never have occasion to say, the <hi>childs teeth
  are edged by the grapes the father only hath eaten,</hi> and in way of
  complaint for injustice, <hi>doth not the son bear the iniquity of the
  Father?</hi> but that every soul that dies shall dy for his own iniquity onely,
  and that individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al soul onely that sinneth shall dy, i. e. eternally, for
  temporally tis true we all dy in <hi>Adam,</hi> as far as a to temporal death,
  God may, and often doth visit the sins of the Father on the children to the
  third and fourth generation of such as hate him not onely when children
  inherit, so as to imitate their fathers hatred of God, in which case only tis a
  punishment to those children, but also on infants, so as to take them out of
  the world with the fathers: as in the case of <hi>'Dathan</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biram,
  Amaleck, Hittites, Amorites &amp;c.</hi> yea <hi>Sodom</hi> and
  <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the old world, on which for ensamples sake to them that
  in after times should live ungodly, the flood, and the fire fell, not onely
  temporal but eternal to the adult ones that gave themselves over to fornication
  and followed strange flesh, though but temporal only to infants, who neither
  lived ungodly, nor gave themselves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to fornication as the other did, and
  therefore though passing hence with the rest to a temporal death by that fire,
  yet are not set forth as an ensample with the rest to all that should live
  ungodly, by suffering the vengeance of eternal fire 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 6. Iude</hi>
  7.</p>
               <p>But the same temporal death that may be in fury to one, as tis a
  passage to worse, may be a mercy to another, and so to those infants a passage
  from worse to better, as good <hi>Iosiah</hi> was slain in battell, as well as
  wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> and that for going on his own head to war as well he, yet
  was it in respect of that eternall state that followed, as well for him, as ill
  for <hi>Ahab.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sith therefore its said so plainly the son shall not die for the
  iniquity of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet temporally they may be taken away with the
  father, it must needs be meant that eternally none die, nor lye for ever under

  those of believers, in a visible state of salvation, and while they live
  infants, unlesse hereafter they reject it, as <hi>Esau</hi> did the land of

  since these, more then those, i. e. the infants of unbelievers more then of

               </p>
               <p>Secondly as for righteousnesse theres enough in Christ to take
  away, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, what ever unrighteousnesse is imputed for
  <hi>Adams</hi> sin, and why that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse should not be imputed, if the
  Scripture had not said it so plainly as it does <hi>Rom. 5. 2 Cor. 5. 19. 21. 1
  Cor.</hi> 15. 22. to all poor dying innocent infants <pb n="460" facs="tcp:42067:235"/> as
  well as some, I cannot imagine, unlesse you say not God the fathers love to
  all, but man the fathers faith, is that thing that must save some of those
  infants of believers, that are savd, by interessing that fruit of his body in
  the righteousnesse of Christ, as well as himself, for the taking away the sin
  of his soul, which faith a father wanting, the child shall perish for ever in
  default out, and yet be in no fault in the world about it:</p>
               <p>Alas poor infants indeed, that descend from such parents as
  believe not, if it be so, that that the fathers faith onely does interest the
  infant in Christ, their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, the first <hi>Adam</hi> by his sin
  unawares to them damned them say they, and say I, if it did, theres
  righteousnesse enough in the heavenly father, and the second <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> to
  save them, but because not they themselves, for they have no more ability so to
  do then a new born infant hath to dresse its naked body, but their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers put
  it not on by faith for themselves, and theirs, which if the dying infants might
  live to years, as Christ said of <hi>Sodom,</hi> they happily would do,
  therefore mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of these poor innocents must perish: so then belike it is
  thus, and this is the covenant of the Gospel, the fathers faith saves him, and
  all his dying infants, and the fathers sin of unbelief damnes for ever not
  himself onely, but all his dying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants also.</p>
               <p>All infants that are damned then, are damned through the fault
  of two unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fathers, a remote father for sinning, and and immediate father
  for not believing, between which two the love of the heavenly father cannot
  come at them: a wise man may spend all he hath with looking, but never find
  such as this in all the Scripture: earthly inheritances are oft stated, and
  removed to and from posterity for fathers faith, and faults, as all
  <hi>Abrahams</hi> posterity by <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> did enjoy
  <hi>Canaan,</hi> and <hi>Esaus</hi> lost it, but the eternal inheritance is
  neither won nor lost by the children, through the faith or unbelief of the
  parents: and besides if <hi>Adams</hi> sin, though a remote parent, doth so
  damnifie all infants, that the righteousnesse of Christ cannot save them,
  without the fathers faith, me thinks he being their great grand father,
  <hi>Adams</hi> faith should recover him and all his, at least from that guilt
  his sin brought upon them; by interessing them in Christs righteousnesse, as
  well as his single unbelief at first destroyed them, if any fathers saith shall
  entitle his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to salvation; or else God seems not to be so prone to
  mercy as severity, yea indeed he that saies God is not more prone to severity
  then to mercy, and shewes it no other way, as to his dealing with innocent
  infants, then by saying he saves no more dying of infants then those few, i. e.
  some of the dying infants of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and from the Mothers womb damns
  eternally all the rest, may say over that his creed in my hearing 500 times and
  ten, before I shall learn to believe it after him once.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as to threatnings of damnation I find none at all to
  insants in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infancy, from one end of the book of God to the other, but
  all that ever is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as concerning eternal wrath, the second death,
  everlasting damnation, the Lake of fire, is declared as the portion of those
  onely that do, and do not that, which was never at all, much lesse in order to
  salvation, and on pain of eternal fire enjoined by infants either to be done,
  or forborn: yea this is the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and nothing else that I know of,
  that light more or lesse comes to persons, and they love darknesse more then
  light because their deeds are evil, those that Christ speaks nothing at all to,
  as he does to heathens themselves <hi>Rom. 1. Rom.</hi> 2. but not to infants,
  that yet know not the right hand from the left, much lesse either good or evil,
  they have not sin, for sin is the transgression of that law, that is lent us to
  live by, whether a law within onely, or without also <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. but when
  he hath spoken and they obey not, when they know God, and glorify him not as
  God, then they are without excuse, and have no cloak at all for their sin: and
  the word he hath spoken to every one, being rejected that same word shall judge
  him at the last day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:42067:235"/> I find it said no whoremonger, fornicator

  neither know him, nor obey him, for if he should then believers infants should
  therefore to the pot as well as others, as who in infancy obey no more then
  their fellows; that the fearful and unbelieving, and dogs, and socerers, and
  murderers, and all liars &amp;c. but not liars dying infants, shall have their
  portion in the lake of fire burning with brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, which is the second death;
  and that the unprofitable servant, that traded not with his talent, and not
  infants, that in infancy have no talent to trade with, shall be cast into utter
  darknesse; that those on whom Christ called, and they would not hear, and to
  whom he stretched out his hands, and they regarded him not, and would none of
  Christs councel nor reproof, shall call on him at that day and not be heard,
  and not infants on whom he never called; that the Lord added to the Church
  dayly such men and women <hi>Act.</hi> 2. not at all such infants, as should be
  saved; that he that believeth not the gospel shall be damned, but not infants
  to whom he never preached; that it shall be said to the wicked, go ye cursed

  which, if there were any that died infants, they might justly reply indeed, as
  no wicked men at years can do, Lord when saw we thee in distresse, and
  neglected thee, and did not come and minister unto thee?</p>
               <p>In a word the whole body of the new Testament or covenant in the
  promissory, praeceptory, and minatory parts of it (saving some two or three
  such gentle touches about infants, as those above named, whereby we may have
  hopes that none of them dying such, are for ever lost) was written and given
  to, and concerning men and women, and not infants, to declare unto them the way
  of everlasting salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in what wayes God would and would not accept of
  them, and he that with an unprejudiced spirit observes all this will trouble
  himself no more about his infants to inchurch and baptize them for remission of
  sins, which is the prime use of baptism to sinners, and utterly lost when

  sins, not indeed to do more then instruct them as they grow up, and pray for
  them while they live infants, and hope well of them if they dy in their
  minority: but it pitties my heart for them to see what moyl and toil the
  Priests create to themselves and the people, and what much ado they make about
  their poor infants, even much more then about themselves.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Iacobs being Lovd before he was born</hi> (he means

                     </gap>.</hi> tenth ground of hope that believers infants are from the
  womb in a hopeful way, I suppose he takes it to be so declared, but is
  miserably mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if he think the ninth of the <hi>Romans</hi> saies so, for
  tis true the elder shall serve the younger, which relates to the posterity of
  those two, and not their persons (for <hi>Esau</hi> was mostly Jacobs Lord) was
  said before they were born by God, who foreseeing it might easily foretell how
  it should be and did so too, but for the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ds <hi>Iacob have I loved, Esau have I hated,</hi> as they also
  were spoken of the two Nations, that came out of their loines viz. the
  <hi>Edomites</hi> and <hi>Israelites,</hi> and that not without respect to
  <hi>Edoms</hi> being the border of wickednesse, so far was it from being spoken
  of them before they were born, that twas hundreds of years after they were dead
  and rotten, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>But if it were just as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> understands it, that
  before they were born, and without any respect to their personal rebellion, and
  obedience in time it had been said <hi>Iacob</hi> have I loved, <hi>Esau</hi>
  have I hated, would it prove that article in Mr. B<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. creed that God hath
  promised to be merciful to Godly mens seed in general, in contradistinction to
  the seed of the wicked? in no wise, I suppose; since as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as

  had not lost it, much less if he had dyed from the womb.</p>
               <p>Fourthly as for the universallity of redemption which is by
  Jesus Christs dying, as Mr. <hi>Ba.</hi> saies ttuely, for all, for every man,
  for the sins of the whole world, which he had meant to have drawn an Argument
  from, but did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ot, he might
  ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily have drawn one that would have served my turn in this place,
  <hi>viz.</hi> to have proved that very age, even the whole <hi>species</hi> of
  infants to be savd by Christ from wrath and ruine, except they live to rej<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  overthrowes his hopes by the halves of infants, for it is both a good ground,
  and as good a ground, whereon to hope the redemption from wrath to come of
  every dying infant, as of any one,</p>
               <p>And lastly to conclude my answer to this 22 Argument of Mr. B.
  which I have insisted the longer on, in much hope of helping him to a better
  hope of all dying infants, that neither are, nor are to be added to the visible
  church, whereas I was once set upon by a Gentleman with this objection, who if
  ever this book came to his hands, and this passage to his eye, will remember
  it, though I forbear to name him.</p>

  If we may be assured of the salvation of all our dying infants, we may then in
  love to them knock them on the head in their infancy, and so be sure to prevent
  their per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  that theres no man however born, though a <hi>barbarian,</hi> can be called, in

  which is his body <hi>Ephe. 1. ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover to me there is as much force in it, if Christ had been

  head of the Church, that was circumcised in his infancy, yet was not baptized
  till he came to years, then, though under the Law the circumcised were

  under the Gospel none are to be baptized till they come to years.</p>
               <p>His 25th runs thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Scripture frequently, and plainly tell us of the
  ceasing of circumeision, but never at all of the Churchmembership of infants,
  then though circumcision be ceased, yet we are not to judge their membership to

  for an expresse, or for an implicit tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or having a word for a thing, yet
  one of his propositions will be false let him understand it how he will, for if
  by the Scripture telling us, and having a word for it, he means an expresse
  telling of the cessation of membership <hi>in totidem ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis,</hi> a
  <hi>Syllabical</hi> word given out of that particular by name, then his
  consequence is false, for it follows not because there is not an expresse
  particular prohibition in the New Testament for the cessation of things, that
  were under the old, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not ceased, for so we shall make most
  of the types and ceremonies, among which infant membership was one, as I have
  shewed, to remain in force still as well as that, as the dedication of the
  first born, and many others, the ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of which is not so syllabically
  spoken of.</p>
               <p>But if he mean an implicit prohibition, or word for the
  cessation of Churchmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  infants, which is enough, then there is prohibition enough, yea the very
  command for the cessation of circumcision of infants any more <hi>Act.</hi> 21.
  21. vertually is a command to cease inchurching of infants, for the very end
  and intent of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was the inchurching of infants thereby, which thing
  was formally done then by circumcision, besides circumcision ceasing, the whole
  law ceased with it, the whole of which he was a debtor to keep that was
  circumcised also <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 12. tis sayd summarily thus <hi>viz.</hi>
  that the priesthood i. e. of that testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being changed, there must be of
  necessity a change also of the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="464" facs="tcp:42067:237"/> And so I have done with all his arguments
  for the church-membership of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, which is the second <hi>medium,</hi> and
  next to that of discipleship, by which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> would prove but cannot, infant baptism.</p>
               <p>His third <hi>medium</hi> which he onely names, and handles not,
  therefore I shall do the like in speaking to it, is drawn from the duty of
  parents to engage their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants solemnly to God in Covenant, and runs thus
  <hi>viz. if it be the duty of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian parents solemnly to devote their
  children to God in covenant, then they ought to do it in baptism, but
  &amp;c.</hi> therefore.</p>
               <p>He proves his <hi>Minor</hi> from the practise of the old
  Testament, from the duty of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentsthen, from which time, as to that
  particular of dedicating, and solemn enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their children, it will not
  follow to our doing the like in all respects now as they did, for then we must
  thus dedicate our first born, and that both of man and beast.</p>
               <p>His consequence is also false of his <hi>Major</hi> proposition,
  for I may devote my children in a gospel sense to God according to my duty, I
  mean ingage my self to the Lord to bring them up in the nurture and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>monition of the Lord, and also devote
  them to him in prayer, i. e. give them up to him as his right, and to him to
  teach by his word, and his spirit, when they come to years, and sundry other
  wayes, and yet no necessity of doing any of this in baptism.</p>
               <p>But I shall make this as short as he does himself, and gather up
  the sum of what he hath said <hi>viz. infants are disciples, visible
  Church-members, and to be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engaged to God in Covenant as a holy seed
  &amp;c.</hi> therefore are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, denying now the consequence, as to
  him, as I did the antecedent before, which I have been all this while in
  disproving.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>Ad hominem,</hi> so long as he argues for baptism to be
  after the manner of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, the consequence will not follow, if this
  were as true as tis false, that infants are now disciples, Church-members, and
  a holy seed, and in covenant, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must be baptized; for women
  under the Covenant whereof circumcision was a sign, were both disciples, and
  visible Church-members, and a holy people in the sense of the Covenant, and
  dedicated to God in Covenant as well as males, and yet not then circumcised,
  and why? <hi>viz.</hi> for want of a commission to do it, and the like I say
  now of infants if they were, as twill never be proved while the world stands,
  that they are disciples, in right to visible membership, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his
  sense, and to be ingaged &amp;c. yet of necessity it followes not they must be
  baptized, unlesse there be some command or commission for it, which no man ever
  shall find in the word of Christ: all the rest of his arguments wherein he
  un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to disprove the practise of baptizing naked, and baptizing children
  of Christians of age, as I have shewed above, are <hi>ignoratio elenchi</hi> a
  dispute besides our practise, for we do not so, therefore though I see some
  grosse absurdity in them all, yet Ile meddle no more with them here.</p>
               <p>Thus I have done with both that subject of rantizing, which
  partly at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of you <hi>Ashford</hi> disputants I was ingaged in at
  the end of your <hi>Review,</hi> and partly by that meer demi-reformation that
  is made in this point of baptism by a party of men in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi>
  and elsewhere, (of whom I suppose there are several congregations) who having
  long since discovered the true way of baptism, as to the subject, <hi>viz.</hi>
  that professing believers onely, and not any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are to be baptized, but
  remaining ignorant of the true way and form of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of that
  ordinance are fallen into a frivolous way of sprinkling belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which to do
  is as much no baptism at all, as to dip infants in no baptism of Christs
  ordaining: which people, for whose sakes as well as others I write this, will
  be perswaded I hope in time to be, as to the outward form, not almost onely,
  but altogether Christians, and rest no longer in that meer midway mongril
  reformation. I have done also with this book of Mr. <hi>Baxs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> for
  infant baptism, the weak argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of which for it were enough, if I had no
  more, to convince me of the error of <pb n="465" facs="tcp:42067:237"/> it, &amp; to make
  me doubt ofit, &amp; renounce it, even as M. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>.</hi> himself saies he had like to have done once,
  when he saw the weak arguments of others for it, which had he done, he had done
  no more then what is his duty to do now, and in order to Gods glory though it
  were as much to his own shame, as it will be rather for his honour, to deny
  himself, and imbrace the truth as tis in Jesus, I hope he may do yet in due
  time, if he do not shut his eyes against the Gospel, because I find him saying
  and unsaying again what he said before he had well studied itp. 113. and he is
  out in print for infant baptsm, and against the true baptism, for all his
  professions of so serious search after it, before he had well studied it to the
  bottom: if he do not recant his error, I am confident some of the people will,
  that have been deluded by him, and out of love to the Lord Jesus, that loved
  them as a Priest, and washed them from sin, in his own blood, and as a Prophet,
  and a King requires them so to do, arise and be baptized, as they ought,
  washing away their sins calling on the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Thus my friends and you my <hi>Ashford</hi> Antagonists, you
  have my mind amongst you in this matter,</p>
               <p>If any one of you answer, and I have satisfaction from him to
  the contrary, he shall hear of my recantation, if I have not, he shall see it
  by my silence, for Ile ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lose so much time, as I have done by the bare
  writing of this, from preaching to poor ignorant creatures the free love and
  rich grace of God in Christ to all that obey him in truth, and as I see I must,

one particular subject, to every of those particular persons, that may
successively desire it, I have therefore thought good (being called to the

the publication of that abusive pamphlet concerning the
<hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-disputation</hi> for infant-baptism, but also their professed
expectation, that I should give some answer, or give the cause) to insert here
this ensuing account of my own reasons, for the right of our remaining in the
use of ordinances till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Christ, and animadversions of what little
reason the Ranter hath to run from them, and redeem himself from that bondage,
which he deems to be in the observation of them, before the time appointed,
much more to run beyond the bounds of modesty and all good manners also, as not
all, but many, if not most of <pb n="467" facs="tcp:42067:238"/> those do first, or last,
who despise any of the ord nances of the Lord Jesus: and herein as I shall be
plain, using no other form, method and order then what the Lord gives into me
as I write, so I must be brief, the foregoing part of this volume having risen
already unawares to a far greater magnitude then was meant to the whole, when I
first cast the bulk of it in my mind, and there remaining also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing yet
to speak, and I know not well how much, to the Priests concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in way of return to the last piece of that pedobaptistical pamphlet which was
pu forth by who knowes? or rather by who knows not whom? in order to the
plainer disquisition of the truth in this question <hi>viz. whether the
ordinances of Christ, that were in use of old, are of right to be practised
still?</hi> as there are fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>
services, then in use, the necessary use of which is now denied <hi>viz.
baptism in water, laying on of hands, breaking of bread,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

shall addresse my self to prove the practise of these four severally to stand,
even <hi>de jure</hi> till the second coming of Christ, which is yet to
come.</p>
            <p>And because <hi>baptism in water,</hi> though most strenuously
denyed by many to be so much as lawfull to be either dispensed, or submitted
to, and by many even of those that have submitted to it to be necessary, or any
other then a matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, is yet the first in order to be
practised, and that without, or before which we are not once to meddle with the
other, I therfore propound it as the first in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be proved, and in order
to the proof of at least the lawfulnesse thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as say its
si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ful (for this will be included
in the other) I shall by the help of God prove a necessity of it, against such
as judge it needlesse or superfluous, and by several Scriptures shew it to be
such a service, the present performance of which is so far from being sinful,
that it is no lesse then sin and rebellion against Christ himself to leave it
unperformed.</p>
            <p>The Scripture which I shall most directly make use of to this
purpose, and lay as the very <hi>basis,</hi> and foundation of this businesse,
and make as a certain <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal

                  </gap>
               </hi> from whence to argue, and
whether to reduce all the rest, which I shall more collaterally handle, is
<hi>Mat. 28. 18. 16. 20. All power is given</hi> &amp;c. in which place these
things chiefly are observable as subservient to the proof of the point in
hand.</p>
            <p>First, we find <hi>Christ</hi> pleading that absolute power, which
was given him by the father to be the <hi>Soveraign Lord, and Supream
lawgiver</hi> to the whole world thorowout all nations and generations of it
from thenceforth even to the end; in these words <hi>viz. All power is given
unto m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> both in heaven and in
earth</hi> i. e I am he to whom this prerogative is granted to give out to all
men what laws and rules they shall be guided, and governd by, what wayes they
must walk in in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that eternal salvation, which as a <hi>Priest</hi> I
have purchased them to by my own blood, if ever they mean to attain it, I am
that Prophet, 
<note n="a" place="margin">Acts 3. 22.</note> which the Lord hath
raised up unto all people now, instead of <hi>Moses,</hi> who was the faithful
gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver out of Gods will, mind, or Testament to Israel of old, whose voice all
must now hearken to in all things, what ever I say unto them, and whoever
harkneth no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>nesse to the people, a
<hi>leader</hi> and <hi>commander</hi> unto the people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, After he had thus shewed his authority, and commission
from God to be the only Lawgiver, whereby to summon the sons of men to so much
the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attention to him, he next begins to act according thereunto, to
act like him self, to make out his mind to his disciples concerning them and
all men most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely, and plainly about this matter of
<hi>waterbaptism,</hi> and to give order to them both when, and to whom, both
in what time and to what subjects they should dispense it, and likewise both
how, and for how long he would have the nations (as by command from himself,
commissionating his disciples so to teach them) to practise the same
dispensation of <hi>water baptism;</hi> in the two following verses. <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out therefore teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son 
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:42067:239"/> and holy spirit, teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded you, and lo I am with you alwaies even to the end
of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where note first in general three things.</p>
            <p>First, That he gives order to his disciples to teach the nations,
and baptize them in <hi>water in his name</hi> ver. 19. <hi>going out teach all
nations baptizing them in the name of the Father, son and holy spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that whatever order is given out by Christ to his
disciples, concerning this businesse of <hi>water baptism,</hi> as to the order
of its administration, and the term of its continuance, the very same and no
other doth Christen join his disciples to give out to the disciples, that
should be successively in all nations, to be observed as his will concerning
them v. 20. <hi>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, that what ever he gives out as his will concerning both
them and the disciples in the nations that they should make, he gives out as
his standing will and Testament to them, and their standing duty to him in all
ages of the world as well as that, even to the very end thereof, in these words
v. 20. <hi>and lo I am with you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies i. e.</hi> in the observation of these
things I command you, <hi>to the end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly more particularly yet, let it be observed what Arguments
in particular do most naturaly arise hence in proof of the continuance of
<hi>water baptism</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>command from Christ to this very day, and that
from several clauses and passages of this Scripture severally considered.</p>
            <p>First from these words <hi>Go ye out therefore and teach all
nations baptizing them in the name &amp;c.</hi> it is very evident to the utter
confutation not onely of those who are for infant baptism, as is shewed above,
but also of those that are now for no water baptism at all, that our lord
Christ expressely enjoines these two things, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That all those whom his disciples presume to baptize in
his name shall be first taught by them or made disciples, i. e. preached to or
instructed in the Gospel till they learn and believe it. 
<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>for so</hi> Mark <hi>records the
  commission whereby</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is much explaind</hi> Mar. 16.

  he that believeth and is baptizd shall be saved &amp;c.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That all those whom his disciples do teach till they have

two <hi>viz.</hi> discipling and baptizing, believing and baptizing in his will
and Testament to us, that as he would have no creature in the nations be
baptized without precedent teaching and believing, so he would have no creature
that is instructed till he believes to go unbaptized; whereupon in one and the
same word of command he requires both, neither can any one abstract either from
the other (without such violation to the will and Testament of Christ, confirmd
by his blood, which wo be to that man, or angel that disanulleth in the least
particular) so as to take upon him to give a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration to persons either to
be baptized before believing, or to content themselves with belief only without
baptism.</p>
            <p>But first as expresse as tis the mind of Christ that one of these
should be done so expresse it is that the other should be done, and each in its
proper order.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as clear as it is that these are commanded to be done by
the very persons he then spake to viz. that they should teach and baptize, so
clear it is that the very same is commanded to be done in all nations, and
among all people by such persons as should be discipled by them in these words

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, and as long as twas his mind the one should be used
<hi>viz.</hi> teaching and believing, so long twas his mind that the other
should continue, <hi>viz.</hi> baptizing and being baptized, and that was that
they should all abide in force to the very end of the world.</p>

the Lord Christ to pieces, and take what of it will serve their own easie

those do say in figures, though not in words at length) to invent such foolish
instruments, to appoint such simple tooles to be used in his house, such
earthen vessels, such vessels as are not honourable enough, nor fit in their

who camaelion like live up aloft, and yet feed on nothing but the meer air of
their own high flown fancies, I must needs say thus much here, before I come to
the other argument <hi>viz.</hi> that as wise and strong as they reckon upon
themselves to be, so that they can live to God and thrive toward salvation as
well without baptism, or any other ordinance as those that use it, and as poor

            <p>
               <hi>As many as Christ commanded to be taught, preacht to, and made
disciples, are commanded when discipled to be baptized in water in the name of
the father, Son and holy spirit,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Christ commanded all nations, even every creature therein,
that is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thereof, to be taught, preacht to, and discipled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo, all nations, even every creature, none excepted, so soon
as discipled, are commanded to be baptized, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:42067:240"/> The first proposition is most undeniably
evident, for teaching and baptizing are both concluded here under one and the
very same numerical command, and both instituted here <hi>de novo</hi> as parts
of the will and Testament of Christ in one and the same word of institution,
and both enjoined to be used to one and the same subject <hi>viz. all nations,
every creature,</hi> therefore if every creature as far as capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be
preacht to by us, and we are capable to preach to him, is to be taught, as is
expressely asserted not onely in the <hi>Minor</hi> but in the texts
themselves, then it must needs follow that every creature, after he is preacht
to and converted to the faith by our instruction, is to be baptized, and that
no creature is exempted or excused from being baptized, any more then he is
from being taught and discipled, no not one, and consequently that baptism is
not a meere matter of liberty, and indifferency that may <hi>ad placitum</hi>
be done by us, or let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but a matter of absolute duty, of positive
praecept, and <hi>necessitate precepti</hi> (and therefore how far forth
<hi>necessitate medit ad salutem</hi> is worth examining) a matter of necessity
if not of equall necessity with that of repenting and believing, for if it be
his voice and command equally with the other (and we see tis in one and the
same place, and phrase given out as his will together with the other) then why
it should not be equally obeyed, and that <hi>sub paena,</hi> fith he is that
Prophet whom God hath now raised up unto us, whose voice whoever harkneth not
to in all things whatsoever he saith, shall be cut off from among his people,
no man is able to give a solid reason, nor yet why any should shun to declare
it, it being a a part of that whole councel of God, which the Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> durst not decline to declare the whole of, 
<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 20. 27</note> any more then to
declare the doctrine of faith, repentance and obedience in other things; yea
and such a weighty part of that councel, and of such neer concernment, and
great consequence unto us is baptism, that as it is said, even that despised
dispensation of water baptism, to be from heaven 
<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 21. 25</note>, and not of men, so
they that own it are said to justifie God, and they that reject it and refuse
to submit to it are said to reject the councel of God against themselves. 
<note n="h" place="margin">Luk 7. 29. 30</note> 
               <hi>And all the
people that heard, and the Publicans justified God, being baptized with the
baptism of</hi> John, <hi>but the Pharisees and Lawyers rejected the councel of
God against themselves being not baptized of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to prove it to be no matter of meer indifferency, but of duty
to all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, I argue yet further from the forenamed Scripture thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which is positively commanded to be done, and dispenst to
all persons,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note> 
               <hi>when once discipled,
without exception of any, and without the least intimation of a dispensation
from Christ to any to omit it, is not a matter of meer indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but of
absolute duty among all those persons that are so discipled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But baptism is positively commanded to be dispensed to all
persons when once discipled, without exception of any, and without the least
intimation of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation from Christ to any to omit it, yea I may say as
positively commanded to be dispensed to disciples as persons are commanded to
be taught, discipled or to repent and believe the Gospel, and that is so
positively that he that knowing it to be Christs will concerning him submits
not to it, obeyes not Christ in it, shall be damned. Ergo baptism is no matter
of meer indifferency but of absolute du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all believers, or
disciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is most undeniable: the <hi>Minor</hi> also is
most expresse and obvious to every eye in the text it self, where its said (in
one intire sentence by way of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive command concerning both these)
<hi>teach all Nations baptizing them,</hi> i. e. all them that are taught and
made disciples: and not onely in this Scripture but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in several other,
which I may alledge very subservient unto this as to the proof of the second
proposition. The first whereof is <hi>Act. 22. 16. and now why tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest thou?
arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the
Lord,</hi> where it is not a little worth our noting in this case, that
<hi>Ananias</hi> doth not onely in one and the same sentence command
<hi>Paul</hi> to be baptized as stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, <pb n="471" facs="tcp:42067:240"/> as to call on
the name of the Lord, but also checks him in a certain round reproof, and angry
expostulation, for his lingring, and del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ying in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which he could not rationally have done if
it had been, no neglect of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in <hi>Paul</hi> to be tardy to it, and a
matter of no necessity, but of such indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>y that twas, without danger of incurring divine
dispeasure, at <hi>Pauls</hi> choice whether he would be baptized yea or
no.</p>
            <p>The second is <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. the first place, wherein we
read of any practising according to that commission that Christ gives out in
<hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the first time of its beginning to be put in execution, by <hi>Peter</hi> and
the rest, who, being impowred so to do, in obedience thereunto went forth and
preached repentance, faith, and baptism for remission of sins among all nations
<hi>(pro suo modulo)</hi> beginning at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as also they were
required to do <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 47. in which Scripture (I mean <hi>Acts</hi>

there present, that had not yet perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med these services, without exempting
any one of all those thousands he then spake to one jot more from the practise
of baptism, then of repentance it self, which phrase, <hi>viz. Repent, and be
baptized every one of you &amp;c.</hi> he could not warrantably have delivered
himself in unto them in the name of Christ, if he had not had clear commission
from him by way of precept to impose baptism on all men as the mind of Christ
concerning them, and a duty to be practised by them all as well as repentance,
without holding any one excused.</p>
            <p>The third is <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

10. 47. 48. Can any man forbid water why these should not be baptized, which

them was no lesse then their duty and the positive will of God concerning them
(for its said to <hi>Cornelius v.</hi> 6. that <hi>Peter</hi> should tell him

<hi>Peter</hi> in this matter, you go about to urge it as an absolute duty and

satisfyed without it, but else may full as well be let alone; we have the most

are like one another (whereby it may be gathered what contrary spirits he, and
they speak by) for whereas he reasons thus, <hi>viz.</hi> these men have
received the spirit, and have the most substantial baptism already, as well as
those that are baptized in water, therefore who can forbid water why, or give
any good reason to the contrary why these should not be baptized? and

forbidding it, as needlesse, at best but indifferency, or obey God by the mouth

            <p>Tis clear therefore out of all these places that water baptism is

indifferency as that it may, without sin on either side, be done or not dore,
which we please, for such things onely and indeed are indifferent, of which we
may by the word say as <hi>Paul</hi> saies of meats and marriage <hi>viz. one

never be baptized they have not sinned &amp;c. nay both Christ and they speak
here in way of peremptory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of all persons to one point; for
whereas if baptism were a matter thus left to our minds, Christ must have said
to his disciples <hi>go teach all nations, every creature,</hi> baptizing as
many of those you make disciples onely as judge it needful, as have a mind to
it, not teaching them to observe that outward rite, any further then they
please, and <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> to those he

            <p>Yea verily tis very remarkable in my mind, and as well worth our
heeding as any thing else in this case; that when <hi>Paul,</hi> in his
trembling and astonished condition, enquired of the Lord what he would have him
to do, the first thing and well nigh the onely thing that the word expresses
that Christ by the mouth of <hi>Ananias</hi> declared to him as his will at
that time, which was immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his conversion, was this duty of
baptism: see <hi>Act. 6. 9. and the trembling and astonished said Lord what
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thou have me to do? and the
Lord said unto him arise and go into the City, and it shall be told thee what
thou must do,</hi> which passage <hi>Paul</hi> relating of himself
<hi>Act.</hi> 22. 10. expresses it thus <hi>viz. and I said what shall I do
Lord? and the Lord said to me arise, and go into</hi> Damascus, <hi>and there
it shall be told thee of all things, which are appointed for thee to
do:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when he was come into <hi>Damascus, Ananias</hi> speaks thus
to him v. 14. <hi>the God of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou should know
his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what part of Christs will doth the word say <hi>Ananias</hi>
there makes known to <hi>Paul</hi> in that place, as that which at that time he
must do, and was appointed that he should do? no more then what is exprest in
these words <hi>Act. 22. v. 15. 16. thou shalt be his witnesse unto all men of
that thou hast seen and heard. And now why tarriest thou? arise and be baptized
and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Peter</hi> in his first preaching the praeceptory part
of Christs Gospel to the Jews, when they enquired what they should do? and to
the company at <hi>Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's</hi> house, and <hi>Ananias</hi> in his to
<hi>Paul,</hi> when he quaeried what he should do? did preach baptism as the
will of Christ concerning them as well as repentance, prayer and such like
duties, so we shall find it was the constant course of all other primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
preachers in their preachings of Christ to any people, to hold forth baptism to
them, as that which was to be submitted to by them out of hand, after faith and
repentance professed, and also the constant course of persons converted to the
faith without delay to submit to that dispensation accordingly, for howbeit the
very form of words, wherein they spake to them concerning baptism, and prest it
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believers as their duty, is not set down syllabically in every place,
where its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, yet most manifestly evident, and past all doubt it is to
any, but such as seeing will n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

see, that in their doctrine, they delivered the mind of Christ to people in
this point of baptism, and commanded it too, even in those places, where the
Scripture doth not expresse what they said, or else how it came to passe that
their converts were acquainted with it so as readily to imbrace it, and some of
them to demand it, as we find they did, I know not, unless we shall imagine
they knew and owned it by some divine immediate instinct. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 13.

opening the heart of <hi>Lydia so that she attended unto the things which were

undoubtedly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the things that <hi>Paul</hi> preached together with
her, doth not this palpably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose that baptism was one of those things
spoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> and prest upon that Auditory, or else how came she to
know it? and also to what purpose did she perform it? likewise <hi>Act.</hi>
16. 30. 31. 32. 33. to the Jaylor asking Sirs what must I do to be saved? its
said that <hi>Paul and Silas preached the word of the Lord, and to all that
were in his house:</hi> but what word of the Lord was it that they 
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:42067:242"/> spake to them? indeed the summe of their doctrine is not
set down, but that the doctrine of baptism was some of it, as well as faith,
which is expressely set down, as that which concerned them in the first place
is clear, or else its a mystery to me how he and all his, who are said v. 34.
to believe in the Lord together with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

more to submit to be baptized straightway: so <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 8. its said
that <hi>Crispus the chief ruler of the Synagogue, and all his house and many
of the Corinthians, hearing the word, believed and were baptized,</hi> which
how or why they should suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be, if the word they then heard
(none of which is set down) did not hold forth baptism as well as faith I
cannot possibly conjecture: in like manner we read <hi>Act.</hi> 8 4. that
<hi>Philip went to Samaria and preached Christ to them, and v. 12. that when
they believed the things spoken by</hi> Philip <hi>pertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, and the name of Iesus Christ, they were baptized both men and
wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> yea and this not a service they submitted to on their own heads,
in their own names, as that which, had they been so pleased, they might as well
have forborn, but v. 16. <hi>they were baptized in the name of the Lord
Iesus,</hi> its said also v. 35. of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> that <hi>Philip
preached unto him Iesus,</hi> not one jot of <hi>Philips</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unto him
is set down, but the next newes we hear is this v. 36. that coming to a certain
water in the way, the Eunuch desired to be baptized, saying <hi>see here is
water, what hinder, why I may not be baptized?</hi> doth not all this plainly
import, howbeit what <hi>Philip</hi> preached to the <hi>Samaritans</hi> and

            <p>And as this doctrine of water baptism was thus universally
preached in Christs name, as his will concerning those that were converted and
discipled, in obedience punctually to Christs Commission in that kind <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

primitive ages of the Gospel, so was it as universally imbraced, and obeyed by
them that were made disciples in those dayes, not onely before, but also after
Christ crucified: for as in the dayes before <hi>Iohn</hi> the baptist was
beheaded, and before Christ crucified, all those multitudes of disciples, which
by each of them were made by teaching, were universally baptized either by
<hi>Iohn,</hi> confessing their sins, or by Christs disciples, who dispenst in
Christs name, for he dispenst not himself, in <hi>Enon,</hi> or
<hi>Iordan,</hi> or some other places that were convenient <hi>Mat. 3. 5. 6.
Iohn</hi> 3. 22. 13. 4. 1. 2. so even long after Christ crucified, raised, and
ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded were the people, that were discipled and converted to the faith,
before ever they joined in visible Church-fellowship in one body in breaking of
bread and prayers, baptized all without exception: for as its said
<hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. 40. 41. 42. of that first Church of the Jews, or Hebrews,
to whom that Epistle was after written, they were bid to be baptized every one
of them, so as many of them as did gladly receive the word of the Lord i. e. as
repented and imbraced the Gospel, were baptized, and then continued in the
Apostles doctrine (who surely taught them all the six first principles of the
oracles or holy things of God at that time, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. 6. 1. 2. and
what more they saw occasion for, for with many more other words then those that
are recorded did <hi>Peter</hi> then exhort that people v. 40.) 
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:42067:242"/> and in fellowship and in breaking of bread and prayers,
so its said 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. of the whole Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in
way of sacramental metonymy, whereby that is very familiarly spoken of the

            </p>
            <p>Yea as these Churches in <hi>Iudea, Ierusalem,</hi> and
<hi>Corinth</hi> were all baptized before built up in a body, so which of all
the Churches were not, to whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles directed afterward those several

is more then bruitish to imagine, for surely <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>
that went immediately thither from <hi>Philippi</hi> where the <hi>Iaylor</hi>
and <hi>Lydia</hi> and many more were baptized, had not got a new doctrine of
no-baptism to preach before they came to <hi>Thessalonica;</hi> nay it is
evident by the Jews accusation of them <hi>Act.</hi> 17 6. that what doings and
disturbance they were occasion of through their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and baptizings at
<hi>Philippi,</hi> the same they were by the same means, no causes, but
occasions of at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> therefore of them say they, <hi>these
that have turned the world upside down are come hither also,</hi> yea
<hi>Paul</hi> himself hints that to us, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 2. that after they
had suffered and were shamefully intreated at <hi>Philippi,</hi> they yet were
bold to speak to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> the Gospel of God (the same Gospel
sure that they preacht at <hi>Philippi,</hi> for what he did and ordained in

16. 1) with much contention.</p>
            <p>By all which foregoing considerations the <hi>Minor</hi> of the
third main argument above is cleared, which assure baptism to be commanded to
all without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore a duty from which we are not exempted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What Christ commanded to be taught and observed not only in
and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Arg. 4.</note> 
               <hi>all nations of the world, but
also in all ages and generations thereof even to the very end, the same is
not</hi> ad placitum, <hi>but</hi> de jure, <hi>not at mens own pleasure, but
of right to be taught and observed as Christs will, and their duty in all

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Christ commanded Baptism in water to be taught and
observed not onely in and among all Nations of the world, but also in all ages
and generations ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of even to the end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo Baptism in water is not at mens own pleasure, but of
right to be taught and observed as Christs will and their duty in all nations
to this very day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor,</hi> which only needs proving, needs none neither
to him that will but observe how plain it is to every mans understanding in the
text.</p>
            <p>For first if baptism be to be taught to, and observed as duty
among all nations and by every creature therein that hears and believes, as tis
clear it is both here (for teach them saies Christ i. e. <hi>all nations to
observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you,</hi> and did he not command
them in the very verse above the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that administration of
baptism?) and also <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. 16. (where he bids that the Gospel of
salvation be from thenceforth tendred on terms of faith and baptism to all the
world, to every creature capable of being preach to) then of necessity in all
nations and generations to the worlds end, for all nations were not then
extant, but many nations are risen since, that the world then knew not, all the
world, every creature was not in actual being at that time, neither could
pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be all baptized unless baptism abide in its right in all ages unto
the end, by all nations, every creature, all the world, Christ denoted all
people of the earth <pb n="476" facs="tcp:42067:243"/> that then were, or thereafter should
be, whom, as they should successively arise, and grow into capacity for it, he
would have to be in their several generations suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively taught and
baptized.</p>
            <p>Besides how plainly doth Christ expresse his meaning to be that
this course of baptizing in wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>er
should be kept a foot in all ages and generations v. 20. where after his
precept to observe that dispensation he adds this promise of his presence,
<hi>And lo I am with you alwaies i. e.</hi> in your faithful observation of all
these things (for if men be not found in this way he is disingaged) <hi>even to
the end of the world Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whence the argument in form may be thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What way of outward administration Christ not onely required
to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Arg. 5.</note> 
               <hi>be observed to the end, but
likewise promised his people to be present with them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their due
observation of to the very end of the world that must stand of right to the
very end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But Christ hath not onely required that outward administration
of water bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism to be observed to the end of the world, but likewise hath
promised his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be present with them during their due observation of it
to the very end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>The objections that are usually made against what is asserted

  God ward in order to his acting toward us in the other, for men may promise us
  the spirit, and shew us what to do, and baptize us in water in order to our
  having the spirit, and pray for us that we may receive the holy spirit &amp;c.
  and minister to us outwardly in the ordinances of divine service, which this
  new Testament hath, which in respect to the old Testament is called the
  ministration of the Spirit, because God gives down to them that wait on him
  sincerely and believingly in these outward waies of the Gospel, which are (to
  see to) but foolish instruments, earthen vessels, in some measure here the
  heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his spirit, and hereupon as they hold forth the word of
  the gospel, in the hearing of which the spirit is received, as twas not in the
  hearing of the law (for the spirit was not the promise of that Covenant of
  Circumcision, but the old <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> for I will circumcise thy heart
  &amp;c. was a Gospel promise though made in the time of the law) and in these
  respects, <hi>viz.</hi> as preaching, and dispensing gospel ordinances they may
  be stiled (and in such a sense onely are they so stiled, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 6.)
  Ministers not of the Letter, i. e. the Law, but of the spirit, i. e. the
  Gospel; <hi>But thereis but one and the same Lord, and tis one and the same God
  who worketh all in all. All in All</hi> is Christs own glorious title,
  <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pullos</hi> and the Ministers by whom we believe may
  work, and do all that is to be done without to all men, they may baptize in
  water by commission from Christ (for so he himself baptized not but his
  disciples, <hi>viz. Iohn Baptist</hi> and the rest) and wicked men may by his
  permission baptize, i. e. overwhelm us with suffering, shame &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But himself onely baptizes us with that holy spirit of his, that

  as in sole right to that service, <hi>the same is he that baptizeth with the
  holy spirit,</hi> and as <hi>Iohn</hi> did baptize onely with water, so with no
  more then water did all the disciples and Apostles after Christ crucified
  baptize; not with the spirit, (for that Christ onely did in their due
  dispensation of the other) they had no promise any where that I find of such a
  priviledge: I find it promised to them <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9. that they should be
  baptized with the holy spirit not many daies thence, but never that they should
  baptize with the holy spirit, Christ keeps him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the right of powring that

               <p>I am ashamed therefore at the cloudy conceits of such as say

  baptize the Nations after teaching <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18 19. 20.</p>
               <p>And the rather because,</p>
               <p>Secondly, its as clear as if it were written with a beam of the
  sun, that what was done most immediately, and more remotely by the disciples in
  obedience to that commssion, when once power was come on them to go forth (till
  when they <pb n="478" facs="tcp:42067:244"/> were to stay, and forbear their testimony
  <hi>Luke 24. 47. 48. 49. Act.</hi> 1. 8. which was no more but teaching, and as
  to baptism the baptizing in water: for <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. <hi>Peter</hi>
  promised them indeed that they should receive, or be baptized with the holy
  spirit in case they would repent and be baptized, but the baptism he prest them
  to, and upon which he promises the other cannot be that of the spirit, but
  water, unlesse weel feign <hi>Peter</hi> to have spoken such Tautological
  non-sense as this to them <hi>viz. repent and be baptized with the spirit, and
  then you shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the holy spirit,</hi> and as the beginning of their
  execution of Christs commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion was no other (save what they promised) as to
  their dispensation of baptism, then teaching and baptizing in water, and after
  praying for the Spirit with laying on hands, so were all their proceedings
  suitable hereunto, for he is fast asleep with his eyes open, resolving to see
  and say nothing in favor of water baptism, but to cry it down against light,
  that shall say that those which are said to be baptized in the name of the Lord
  Iesus, <hi>Act. 8. 12. 16. Act.</hi> 19. 5. and to be commanded by
  <hi>Peter</hi> to be baptized in the name of the Lord <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 48.
  were baptized by <hi>Philip, Paul, Peter</hi> or any man else with any more
  then meer water baptism, for the baptism with the spirit is in all these places
  spoken of as received from God in way of laying on of hands in prayer, and
  preaching besides the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as either preceding or succeeding it, as the Lord

               <p>You talk as if the baptism with water was an ordinance of
  <hi>Iohn,</hi> a baptism of which not Christ, but <hi>Iohn</hi> was under God
  the main Moderator <hi>pro tempore</hi> while it stood in force, as if
  <hi>Iohn</hi> had instituted, and ordained it, and Christ put an end to it, as
  if <hi>Iohn</hi> were the Author of it, and Christ the finisher, to cause it to
  cease, whereas nothing is more clear then that Christ himself was both the
  Author and finisher of it in another sense, i. e. he that first ordained and
  appointed it to be administred even by <hi>Iohn</hi> himself, and after
  <hi>Iohns</hi> decease, yea and after his own death and resurrection too, gave
  order to its continuance, and for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of it among all Nations now,
  as thitherto it had been observed only among the Jews: I say its clear that the
  baptism with water was Christs baptism, and howbeit it be called
  <hi>Iohns,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> was the first minister, and messenger from 
  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:42067:244"/> Christ to begin it, (for behold I send my messenger and
  he shall prepare my way before me saith Christ of <hi>Iohn Mal.</hi> 3. 1,) yet
  Christ himself was the chief Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, in whose name and not in
  <hi>Iohns</hi> it was begun and dispensed ever, even in that jnncture wherein
  <hi>Iohn</hi> himself was living and verst about it, and before Christ had so
  specially commanded the continuance of it in all Nations to the worlds end, in
  his own and the fathers and the spirits name as he does <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18.
  19. 20. and ever after that also as we may see, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 29. where
  <hi>Peter</hi> preaching the same doctrine that <hi>Iohn</hi> himself did
  <hi>viz.</hi> the baptism of repentance for remission of sins 
  <note n="x" place="margin">Mar. 1. 4.</note>, sayes <hi>repent and
  be baptized in the name of Iesus Christ, for remission of sins,</hi> so
  <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 16. they were baptized with this <hi>water baptism in the name
  of the Lord Iesus,</hi> so <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 47. he commanded them to be
  baptized <hi>in the name of the Lord,</hi> so <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 3. 4. where
  after that to certain disciples who were baptized with <hi>Iohns</hi> baptism,
  <hi>Paul</hi> had said <hi>Iohn</hi> veryly baptized with the baptism of
  repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should
  come after that is on Christ Jesus, it is said, that when they heard this they
  were baptized i. e. in water <hi>in the name of the Lord Iesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We see therefore that though its called the baptism of
  <hi>Iohn</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> began it, yet it is that which Christ, who was
  no minister, servant, or disciple of <hi>Iohn</hi> (for <hi>Iohn</hi> was his)
  so owned as his, as not onely to honour it with his own submission to it,
  though in no such need of it as we, &amp; more above it then any of us, to
  fulfil all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of his own law i. e. the Gospel for example sake to

  intimation or other, that when the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit should be given, and men begin
  to be baptized therewith, then there should be no longer attendance given to
  the baptism with water, he would have said go teach all Nations (beginning at
  <hi>Ierusalem)</hi> that there must be now no more bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing with water, but
  that in the way of repentance and faith onely without that baptism, they shall
  be baptized with the spirit, &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> knowing his mind would have
  said to them <hi>Act</hi> 2 39. when they askt what they should do, repent you
  of all your sins and believe in Christ in order to the remission of them, but
  in the name of Jesus Christ be not baptized in water, as some while since every
  penitent was used to be, for that was a dispensation and baptism of
  <hi>Iohn</hi> that had its time a while meerly to prepare the way of Christ,
  but is now abolished and out of date, we must forsake <hi>Iohn</hi> now and not
  be baptized nor walk after those customes, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a baptism with the
  spirit onely, also <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 47. who can require these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be
  baptized in water that have received the spirit, and are baptized with the
  spirit as well as we?</p>
               <p>Thus I say they would have said and done, as <hi>Paul</hi> when
  circumcision, and <pb n="480" facs="tcp:42067:245"/> the Law was to cease, as much as he
  condescended in the case of <hi>Timothy,</hi> yet never commanded it to
  continue, but taught all the Jewes that were among the Gentiles to forsake
  <hi>Moses</hi> saying that they should not circumcise their children nor walk
  after the customes <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 21. if there had been such opposition,
  such inconsistency between the baptism in water, and that of the spirit that
  they must not stand together, if baptism in water must not have remained rather
  in a certain continual subserviency to the other, if it were not to be
  according to Christs will an inseperable companion of his doctrine, but we find
  not the least hint or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the mind of Christ, when expressed either
  by his own mouth or the mouth of his <hi>Apostles,</hi> that were to deliver
  and command nothing to people, but what they had received of the Lord Jesus,
  and what was commanded them of the Lord, as concerning the cessation of that
  service, or any toleration of any one person to omit it, but as we find it a
  part of Christs Gospel and Testament even from the very beginning of it which
  was in Johns baptizing with water, 
  <note n="*" place="margin">See Mar. 1. 1, 2, 3, 4. the beginning of

  have observed it.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore you seem to be of this opinion that Christ was
  not comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, i. e. not commissionated from the Father to baptize with water
  as well as <hi>Iohn,</hi> because its said by <hi>Iohn I verily baptize you
  with water, but he shall baptize you with the holy spirit,</hi> as if Christ
  had had nothing to do to meddle with that water baptism as any ordinance of
  his, or to give any order about it, as if he had had no more power to dispense
  or enjoin that, then <hi>Iohn</hi> had power to meddle in Christs peculiarity,
  or to take on him to baptize with the spirit: I must tell you that Christ had
  command and commission from the Father to that service of water bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
  though, it being the external inferiour matter, he committed the actual
  ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of it to his disciples and Ministers, among whom I look on

  since the Son is lifted up and hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and is risen, it is the baptism

  that was dispensed before Christ had suffered, and was yet to come
  <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 4.) and that of the disciples of Christ after Christ
  crucifyed differ not in substance, but onely in this small circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in
  which also the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r Gospel in point
  of faith did differ, <hi>viz.</hi> that one was a baptism into Christ to
  suffer, the other into a Christ that had suffered; and so they preached a
  different faith, a different Christ, and yet all one and the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea so
  Christs own ministry differed from it self considered in this different time of
  <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> his death: for before both he and his
  disciples preacht the same gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, repentance, faith and baptism that
  <hi>Iohn</hi> did, viz, of salvation by the son of God to suffer, but had
  <hi>Iohn</hi> liv'd till Christ had suffered, he would then have preached the
  same repentance, faith, and baptism that Christ then did, and we now do,
  <hi>viz.</hi> of salvation by the son of God that hath suffered, and this is
  all the same substantially, though circumstantially thus diversified from the
  other; wherefore the word of the Gospel under <hi>Iohn,</hi> and after Christs
  death, is called the very same word, and the word that <hi>Peter</hi> preacht
  to <hi>Cornelius's</hi> house, is said to begin from <hi>Iohns</hi> baptism,
  and as the word with which <hi>Iohn</hi> came preaching, so the baptism with
  which <hi>Iohn</hi> came baptizing continued still, and was preached and
  practised by command from Christ by the mouth of <hi>Peter</hi> on disciples
  belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in that very place <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. &amp;c. to
  the end, and this not, in honour of <hi>Iohn</hi> (as in discourse with some it
  hath been frivolously answered me) but as a thing which ought to be done as in
  force a new from the Lord Christ in whose name (which <hi>Peter</hi> abus'd to
  them, if he had not warrant from Christ so to do) he commanded them all, and
  that in water, to be baptized.</p>

  to preach the Gospel, i. e the baptism of faith and repentance for remission of

  let such, or such a one baptize you, as if we should be better in having it
  from some hands rather then from others: neither doth the efficacy of baptism
  to us depend one straw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the quality of the person administring be it
  <hi>Paul, Apollos</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or any other disciple inferiour to
  them in capacity or office, as <hi>Ananias</hi> or <hi>Philip,</hi> but upon

  mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not so much who does it, so the thing be done: nay the validity of the
  bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism depends as not upon any other qualifications of the person baptizing,

 not the dis pensacion of it to believ ers.</note> nor yet do I find, but that
  in the primitive times the simple act of baptizing the believers when once
  converted was any other but an act so inferiour, servile and subservient to
  that of preaching the gospel, of preaching re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, faith, and baptism in
  Christs name for remission of sins in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, which more
  specially belonged to the messenger-ship, that it was (unlesse any desired the
  Apostles to do it themselves, or when the multitudes to be baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were so
  great that twas fit that every he disciple, that had two hands, as I may say,
  should be assistant) committed mostly to more inferior persons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
  disciples, who as they might baptize, and preach too occasionally, so when any
  were converted by either themselves or the Apostles, did attend more to the
  bare act of dispensation then the Apostles did: we cannot think that
  <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, nor the eleven did baptize all the three thousand
  without the hands of many other of the 120 to help at least, though in that
  case the Apostles baptized some also tis like.</p>
               <p>Moreover we see <hi>Philip</hi> baptized the <hi>Samaritans</hi>
  and the honourable Eunuch, yet, though an occasional preacher of the Gospel, he
  did it in the capacity of a disciple only, for his deaconship did not make him
  ere the fitter to baptize: and <hi>Ananias</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>Paul,</hi> who is
  stiled but a certain disciple: and the rest of the disciples that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
  with <hi>Philip</hi> were scattered abroad by the persecution that arose about
  <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> went every where, even as far as <hi>Antioch</hi> preaching
  the Lord Jesus, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many unto the <hi>Lord Act.</hi> 11. 19. to the
  end, and baptized them surely as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> did, for that businesse was
  the foundation of the famous Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any such great
  administrators as Apostles came neer them, for though <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> who
  together with <hi>Paul</hi> was sent forth afterward from that Church with
  prayer and laying on of hands, from which time they both were visibly, and in
  <hi>foro Ecclesiae</hi> Apostles, and were so called and not before
  <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 3-14. 14. was sent to confirm and comfort them, and exhorted
  them to continue in that faith which they were baptized into before; yet he was
  but in the capacity of a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disciple only yet, and not an Apostle: nor
  do I believe that <hi>Peter</hi> baptized them with his own hands <hi>Acts</hi>
  10. but by some of them that came with him from <hi>Iop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,</hi> only he bid it
  should be done, as that which no body could forbid, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be
  baptized in the name of the Lord, but by whom twas done we know not.</p>
               <p>The father sent Christ to baptize, i. e. to give order for the
  baptizing of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he should make, or else he could not be truly said
  both to baptize, and yet also to speak and do no more then the Father that sent
  him gave command for, as he is <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 22. 4 1. 12. 49. 40. and yet in
  another sense it may be said Christ was not sent to baptize i. e. personally to
  dispense the ordinance it self, for if he had been sent to baptize with his own
  hands he had not fulfilled his message, for howbeit its said he baptized more
  then <hi>Iohn,</hi> yet he himself dipenst baptism to none with his own hands,
  <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1. 2. but by the hands of his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>When therefore <hi>Paul</hi> saies he was not sent to baptize,
  he means not that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism was none of those things he had in commission to
  meddle with (for had it been so, he had meddled beyond his commission in
  baptizing those few he did baptize with his own hands, which were absurd to
  think) but that he had not such a positive command to dispense it after he had
  preacht the Gospel to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion so himself, but that others even inferior
  persons might baptize the disciples of his converting as well as himself: he
  means not that baptism, was no part of his message, which he received in charge
  from God to deliver and declare among men as his will (for he saies God sent
  him to preach it, <hi>not to baptize but to preach the Gospel</hi> saith he,
  and what was that but the Gospel of repentance and baptism, the baptism of
  faith, and repentance for remission of sins among the nations) but that there
  was no necessity that himself should administer it, when it 
  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:42067:247"/> might be done by others, not that twas not needful to be
  done, but that twas needlesse he personally should dispense it, so it might be
  done by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Neither doth <hi>Paul</hi> make that the ground of his giving of
  thanks to God that no more but <hi>Crispus and Gaius,</hi> and the houshold of
  <hi>Stephanus</hi> &amp;c. were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized (for then he had thankt God that the
  <hi>Corinthians</hi> had most of them neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected their duty in that point of
  baptism, which its evident he preacht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them as well as faith, or else
  sure none of them at all would have submitted, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 8. but that he
  himself had with his own hands baptized but some of them, least (perceiving
  what a foolish dotage on his person was in the hearts of many of them) any of
  them, at least his party (for some doted too much on <hi>Paul,</hi> some on
  <hi>Apollos,</hi> some on <hi>Cephas</hi> i. e. <hi>Peter)</hi> should either
  think the better of their baptism as long as they lived, because he dispenst
  it, or else think the worse of him for it, i. e. that he had baptized in his
  own name: this is the clear <hi>sense</hi> in which <hi>Paul</hi> speaks and
  not the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 14. 15. 16. 17. <hi>viz.</hi> that no more
  then such and such were baptized by his hands, not that no more then such and
  such of them (for they were all baptized by one or other) were baptized at all;
  for that many more then those he there names as baptized by him, were baptized
  by one or other (for all <hi>Crispus's</hi> house, and many more of the
  <hi>Corinthians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Crispus's</hi> his own person, whom onely
  with <hi>Gaius</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> his house, he here names, believed

  verily and elsewhere that all the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, for 1
  <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking to the whole Church of Corinth
  (none excluded) saith thus <hi>were ye</hi> i. e. ye O <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
  that were all baptized, <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in the name of Paul?</hi> and 1
  <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. speaking to and of the whole Church again, together with
  himself, he saies, <hi>we are all baptized into one body, and have been all

  the words that border about it, but as it may happen <hi>pro re substrata,</hi>
  according to the nature of the matter in hand, and according as the sense
  thereof is manifest by the foregoing and following sentences expressing or
  implying it; so that sometimes you shall find it signifying, but some onely or
  a part, exclusively of others or the rest of the body spoken to, or spoken of
  therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and sometimes no lesse then the whole of it, neither is it
  apparent whether <hi>[a]</hi> or but <hi>[some onely]</hi> is the sense of this
  term <hi>[as many as]</hi> where ere tis used, but as tis made appear by the
  context, or some circumstances in it, and not a jot lesse then this is said by
  your self in that very objection of yours I am now answering to, for of
  <hi>Iohn 1. 12. as many as received him, to them gave he power, these words
  plainly intimate</hi> (say you) <hi>that some of them,</hi> i. e. the Jews whom
  its said he <pb n="486" facs="tcp:42067:248"/> came <hi>to, did not receive Christ,</hi>
  and for my part I grant they do so signifie in that place: but why? or how doth
  it appear that they must needs signifie there that but some of the Jews
  received him.</p>
               <p>It appeareth not by any usuall or constant sense of the words
  <hi>as mazy as,</hi> as if they alwayes sounded forth but <hi>some,</hi> and
  never all of such or such subjects as are spoken of, but <hi>it appeareth</hi>
  (say you) <hi>by the words immediately foregoing:</hi> in which verily you say
  right, for the words foregoing do plainly shew what the sense of these words
  <hi>As many as</hi> is in this Scripture, for forasmuch as its said plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
  above, <hi>that he came to his own, and his own received him not</hi> i. e. for
  the generality of them rejected him, therefore its undeniably evident that here
  the words, <hi>as many as received him,</hi> do intimate that some did not
  receceive him; but if you should take these words, <hi>as many as received
  him</hi> abstract from whats said above <hi>viz. that his own,</hi> for the

  these words <hi>as many as,</hi> considered abstractively from the context or

  some, as they are conclusive of some, so considered in a right reference to the

  they will be found sometimes conclusive of no lesse then all those persons or

  sunk: does not the word <hi>as many of you</hi> signifie all the men he speaks
  to, even the whole company of them that are in the ship, and not some of them
  onely? so and no otherwise is it to be understood in these two Scriptures,
  <hi>viz. Rom. 6. 2. Gal.</hi> 3. 27. where you would needs have these words
  <hi>viz. as many of us, and as many of you as were, as have been baptized into
  Christ,</hi> necessarily to intimate no more but that onely some of the
  believing <hi>Romans,</hi> and some of the <hi>Galatians</hi> were baptized,
  and to be conclusive of some in each of these two churches, and exclusive of
  the rest, even of them, as being not baptized, whereas there is nothing in the
  world more plain then this, that these words <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. as many of us
  <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. as many of you, as have been baptized &amp;c. if conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
  with that due relation they bear, and stand in to the words foregoing or
  fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, do intimate to us that the whole Church of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
  that were to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on themselves as dead to sin, and bound to live to it no
  longer, (and that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was no lesse then the whole) were baptized, and
  that all the Churches in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia,</hi> or all the believers among the
  <hi>Galatians</hi> were baptized.</p>
               <p>Yea if the scope of the <hi>Apostle Paul</hi> in both the places
  be observed, we shall find that he makes this no other then an argument, and
  uses it as a certain <hi>medium</hi> or motive whereby to perswade the
  <hi>Romans</hi> that they were all to dy to sin, and now to live to it no
  longer, and to prove the <hi>Galatians,</hi> even all of them, to be, visibly
  to us at least, the sons of God by faith in Christ, because they were all of
  them baptized into Christ, and thereby had visibly put him on.</p>
               <p>First take notice that the businesse he would perswade the whole
  Church at <hi>Rome</hi> to, and prove to be the duty of them all is this, that
  they should now dy to sin, have no more to do with sin, and live to God, now
  how does he prove that, and go about to perswade them to it? which is his
  bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse throwout that whole chapter <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. no otherway (as I find)
  but by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding them of it, that by their being buried with Christ in baptism
  this not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was signifyed to them, but also became the duty of them all, and
  that so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that howbeit before not so obliged, yet from thenceforth they
  must crucify the old man, and utterly abolish the body of sin, and live to
  righteousnesse: what? shall we (saith he, for so his sense is) continue in sin,
  i. e. we that are dead to it, and have been all baptized into Christ in token
  of it? God forbid: know ye not <pb n="487" facs="tcp:42067:248"/> that every one thats
  baptized into Christ, is baptized into his death? yea therfore tis that we, i.
  e. all we still, himself, and the whole Church to whom he writes, are buryed
  with Christ in baptism into death &amp;c. to shew that as Christ dyed, and rose
  again, so we also should walk in newnesse of life, for if we, i. e. all we have
  been planted together i. e. in baptism the lively resemblance of it, in to the
  likenesse of his death, we shall be also in the likenesse of his resurrection,
  &amp;c and so he goes on moving them all now to lead a new life, and to be
  servants to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by the consideration of the great engagements to
  Godward that lay upon them all since such time as they were baptized: and
  forasmuch as you say they had all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed from the heart the form of doctrine
  delivered unto them you therein contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict your self, and confesse no lesse
  then we assert <hi>viz.</hi> that they were all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: for that form of
  doctrine that was at first delivered to them was the form of doctrine spoken of
  <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. even the six first principles of the oracles of God, of
  the doctrine of Christ, which as they are here called a form of doctrine so
  there are called the foundation or <hi>ABC</hi> of a Christian, and of the
  Church, as also <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. the foundation of the Prophets and
  Apostles, i. e. the first doctrine of Christ, on which they built the Church,
  of which baptism is there said to be a part: yea and that very phrase of
  <hi>Paul Rom. 6. 17. viz. ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from
  the heart that form of doctrine, which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to you,</hi> is no other
  then a further prosecution, and inculcation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer argument upon the
  whole Church of the <hi>Romans</hi> still, and is as much as if the had said ye
  were once, i. e. before your baptism the Servants of sin, and then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but
  sin could be expected from you, but now the case is otherwise, you have all
  obeyed the form of doctrine delivered, i. e. have professed your repentance
  from dead works and faith, and been baptized into Christ, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  very meaning of the Apostle in the whole chapter, yea and in those very words
  know you not that as many of us as have been baptized? <hi>viz.</hi> not to
  have us suppose that but some of them had been baptized, but to give them to
  under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that as all of them had been baptized, so as many as are baptized
  into Christ are baptized into his death, in token ofit, that they should now
  all become new creatures: if we speak his mind in a Syllogistical form it runs
  thus <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As many of us as are baptized must know this that we are
  baptized into Christs death, and therefore must dy to sin and live

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But we have been all baptized or buried with Christ in

                  <hi>Therefore we must all dy to sin and live holily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If this were not his sense, but we must take the words <hi>as
  many of us as have been baptized</hi> to be conclusive of himself, and but some
  of that Church, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of the rest of them as to baptism, then I
  testify they are much more exclusive of many of them from that duty of dying to
  sin, which he there presses upon the whole Church, by the consideration of
  their being baptized: yea if that phrase <hi>as many of us as have been
  baptizd</hi> doth intimate to us that not all, but some only of the believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
  <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>s</hi> had bin baptizd,
  then it must needs intimate to us that not all but some of the believing
  <hi>Roms</hi> were engaged by their baptism, and pressed by <hi>Paul</hi> in
  that chap. from the consideration of their death, and burial with Christ in
  baptism, to dy to sin and live to righteousnesse, which no rational man can
  imagine, but rather as they were all urged by an Argument drawn from their
  baptism to live to God, so they had assuredly been all of them baptized.</p>
               <p>And the same may be said of that same phrase as tis used to the
  <hi>Galatians Gal.</hi> 3. to whom <hi>Pauls drift</hi> was to prove what he
  had said of them all in the verse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove v. 26. <hi>viz.</hi> that they were
  all the children of God by faith in Christ: and how doth he prove it that they
  were so? no otherwise but by this <hi>Medium, viz.</hi> that they had been all
  baptized: you are all the children of God by faith in Christ, for 
  <pb n="488" facs="tcp:42067:249"/> as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have
  visibly put him on, and thereby declared you have faith in him, which having,
  you are the children of God: in form his Argument runs thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
  Christ, and are thereby apparently declared to be the children of God by faith
  in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But you have been all baptized into Christ &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This must needs be his sense here too, or else if the term
  <hi>as many of you as have been baptized</hi> must not be taken as conclusive
  of all the <hi>Galatians to whom he</hi> writes, but exclusive of some of them
  from baptism, it must be exclusive of the same persons from being proved by
  <hi>Pauls</hi> Argument drawn from their baptism to to be the children of God:
  as <hi>many as received him to them gave he power to be come the Sons of
  God,</hi> is as much as to say, he gave power to become the sons of God to no
  more then such as received him: so <hi>as many of you as have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
  into Christ have put on Christ,</hi> and are thereby visibly declared to be the
  children of God by faith in him, though it do not signify that all the
  <hi>Galatians</hi> had not been baptized, but some of them onely, yet it
  signifies this however that no more then such as had been baptized into Christ,
  had put him on and were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declared to be Gods children, and consequently
  that if but some of the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> were baptized, but some of them
  onely appeared to be Gods children: which were absurd to think and would render
  <hi>Paul</hi> as contradictory to himself in the verse above, where he saies ye
  are all the children of God, so very ridiculous in his Argument; and render his
  proof as pedling as if he had said thus by way of position, <hi>viz.</hi> you
  are all, even every one of you, the children of God, and then by way of proof
  thus, <hi>viz.</hi> for some of you have been baptized, and by that baptism of

  Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are discipled: so that if you have been converted not lately but

  subject, and to make void his command through his tradition of a new baptism to
  all, or that Christian Religion of the Ranter that so rebells against that law

                  </gap> Apostles or disciples of
  Christ did teach and preach that doctrine: the first of these is <hi>Heb.</hi>
  5. 12. where to that Church <pb n="494" facs="tcp:42067:252"/> of the Hebrews or Iews the
  very platform to all the rest, which, (as to its more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat outward form
  and order, and that denomination of the Church, to which God added dayly such
  as should be saved,) had its first being, and beginning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Peters</hi>
  teaching <hi>Act.</hi> 2. tis said thus <hi>viz. whereas for the time ye ought
  to be teachers, ye have need to be taught again, which be the first principles
  of the oracles of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where note first from the words <hi>taught again,</hi> that they
  were taught once before all the principles of the doctrine of Christ, whereof
  this laying on of hands is said to be one: and not only so, but secondly, from
  these words <hi>you ought to be teachers,</hi> that by this time they should
  have been of ability to teach these principles to others, which also shews that
  these principles ought all along still to be taught:</p>
               <p>Moreover if it be queried where or by whom these Hebrewes were
  at first taught this A B C, these principles of the oracles of God there spoken
  of, is it not as clear as the sun to any serious, understanding, considerate
  spirit that it was by <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in his first
  preaching there in obedience to Christs commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. after
  power was come upon him from on high, in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. which I direct to as
  a second place wherein we may find it preached? did not <hi>Peter</hi> there
  lay this foundation of the principles of the doctrine of Christ among them in
  prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, as they did themselves in practising, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. and
  howbeit the whole form of the doctrine he there delivered is not set down, as
  none of the doctrine that <hi>Philip</hi> preacht at <hi>Samaria</hi> is, nor
  of that <hi>Paul</hi> preacht at <hi>Philippi Act.</hi> 16. 14. nor at
  <hi>Corinth Act.</hi> 18. 8. yet is it not by sundry passages as evident that
  he taught that principle of laying on of hands among all the rest, as it is
  (and how evident that is, is shewed above) that they in those other places
  preached baptism? shall we think that <hi>Peter</hi> taught the principles of
  the doctrine of Christ, all which he was to lay as one foundation among them,
  by the halves? did he build them upon one part of the foundation, and not on
  the other part? did he consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute them partly upon it, and partly beside it?
  did he teach them all the rest of the principles (every of which its said
  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 12. they had been taught) <hi>viz.</hi> faith, repentance,
  baptism, resurrection, and judgement, and did he leave out that one onely of
  laying on of hands, specially since its said that with many other words he
  exhorted that people, who are said there also to continue in the Apostles
  doctrine? what man that devotes himself to the comparing of Scripture with
  Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture can imagine it? and if not, why not be satisfied that it was preacht
  by some at least of Christs Apostles to all baptized believers? A third
  Scripture I direct the inquirers unto, is <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 5. 12. 14. 15. 16.
  17. whence first its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Apostles administring, and the
  <hi>Samaritans</hi> submission to it, that the doctrine in the purport and
  tendency of it, was first declared, (unlesse we shall judge the Saints at
  <hi>Samaria</hi> were such idiots as to act by implicit faith, as men were not
  to do, but by comparison of what they said with the Scriptures, under the
  ministry of the Apostles themselves <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 22. and to yield blind
  obedience to they knew not what, the Apostles also justifying them in it, which
  if they did, then you that professe your selves to be yet ignorant in that
  service, and that you know not the meaning of it may submit to it as safely,
  though as senslessely, as they, from the hands of such as do; which yet when
  all is done I am sure you may not: but</p>
               <p>Secondly, more evident yet if you weigh some passages of that
  text it self, the words whereof are on this wise <hi>viz. then went</hi> Philip
  <hi>down unto</hi> Samaria <hi>and preached Christ to them, v. 5. and when they
  believed the things spoken by</hi> Philip <hi>pertaining to the Kingdom of God,
  they were baptized both men and women, when they at Ierusalem heard that</hi>

  them</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>who when they were come, prayed for them
  that they might receive the holy spirit, for as yet he was fallen upon none of
  them, onely <pb n="495" facs="tcp:42067:252"/> they were baptized in the name of the Lord
  Iesus, then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy
  spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its said that <hi>Philip</hi> preached Christ, and spoke of the
  things pertaining to the the Kingdome of God, and that they received the word
  of God, which they did not surely, so much as to believe what was to be done,
  till he had preached it, now can any rationall man think, that he preached
  Christ and the things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his kingdome, and the word of God, and not
  preach so much as all the principles of the oracles of God, not so much as all
  the first Rudiments or whole beginning word of Christ? but left out imposition
  of hands onely among all the rest, as none of the word of Christ, nor of the
  things pertaining to his kingdome as not to be preacht, no not in that juncture
  wherein immediately after it was to be, and accordingly was, so universally
  submitted to by them, and dispenst unto them? or if you say they received not
  that word of laying on of hands from <hi>Philip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but from
  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, tis true practically from the hands of <hi>Peter</hi>
  and <hi>Iohn</hi> dispensing it, but by faith, so as to believe it to be a
  practicable doctrine that was their duty to own, from the mouth of
  <hi>Philip</hi> dispensing the doctrine, of it, or suppose that <hi>Philip</hi>
  spake nothing of it till <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> came, which is
  <hi>non supponendum,</hi> yet is it likely that the Apostles that were sent to
  them from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> though nothing is said of that they said, that
  therefore they said nothing to them at all? yea will right reason ever receive
  this for truth, that the Apostles were sent to <hi>Samaria</hi> upon the
  account of some service (whether solely that of prayer and laying on of hands
  it matters not so long as that was one part of it at least) and yet neither
  acquaint them (whether before acquainted with it or no) to what end and purpose
  they came, and what was the end and purport of that service they onely or
  mainly came for? he that can receive this let him receive it, for my part I
  professe I cannot.</p>
               <p>A fourth place from whence it is easily gathered that the
  doctrine of laying on of hands in order to their receiving the holy spirit, was
  wont to be preached to all baptized believers is <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 1, 2. 3.
  where <hi>Paul</hi> speaking to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of disciples that he found
  at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the number wherof were then but about twelve, among whom
  the doctrine of laying on of hands in order to the receiving the holy spirit
  had not been preached at the time of their baptism, seems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and blame
  the neglect of it, enquiring whether they had not received the holy spirit,
  supposing surely at least that the promise of it had been to them, and prayer
  made for them in the usual way, with laying on of hands that they might receive
  it, but marveiling much that they, being baptized believers, had not been
  informed about these matters, nor had so much as heard of the holy spirit,
  <hi>have you received the holy pirit?</hi> (saies he) <hi>no nor so much as
  heard of it,</hi> (say they) no? unto what then were you baptized, (saies he)
  if at least you have not so much as heard of it? as who should say, who
  baptized you I wonder, and did not so much as instruct you about the spirit,
  nor, laying on their hands, pray for you that you might receive the spirit?
  this plainly shewes that by right they should all about the time of their
  baptism in water have heard of the holy spirit, and in what way it was to have
  been expected by them, even that of laying on of hands, none of all which they
  having so much as heard of as yet, <hi>Paul</hi> therefore after some words of
  fuller information to them, and such other passages as fell out thereupon laid
  his hands on them verse 6. in order to their receiving the holy spirit.</p>
               <p>These Scriptures (what they are to others I know not) are to me
  a cleer, and safe conduct into the belief of this truth, that the doctrine of
  laying on of hands with prayer in order to receiving the holy spirit, both was
  in the primitive times, and was to be, preached to all baptized believers, as
  that which was no lesse then their duty to own and submit to have dispensed to
  them.</p>
               <p>And as it was so universally taught, and preached, so was it as
  universally <pb n="496" facs="tcp:42067:253"/> in those times practised, dispensed,
  submitted to, ownd and observed in all the churches, and among all baptized
  believers, even men and women without exception: This is evident out of the
  four forenamed places <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 5. 12. 6. 1, 2. Act. 19 6. Act. 8.
 12. 15. 16, 17. Act. 2. 40, 42.</note> in the first of which it is not only
  expresse that they, i. e. all that Jewish Church had been taught this principle
  among the rest, but also that it had been practically owned and observed among
  them as well as all the rest: for as its said there of all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
  together that these Jewes had need to be taught them <hi>again,</hi> so that
  they should not now lay them <hi>again,</hi> but go on to perfection, which
  shews that as these principles had been all preacht to them all, so all these
  Jewes or Hebrews did once lay them all as a foundation at their first beginning
  to be a Church, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this of laying on of hands among the rest.</p>
               <p>In the second we read that <hi>Paul</hi> laid his hands on all
  the baptized believers that he found at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> being then no more in
  number then about 12. speaking (as it were) by way of blame, and reproof of
  those by whom they were baptized, that this was not also done by them at their
  baptism, in order to their receiving the holy spirit, much more in that they
  were not so much as informed that there was a holy spirit to be expected by
  them <hi>ver.</hi> 32. 3. which may serve also as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, that
  say, as some of the inquirers do, that the reproof of the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of any
  service doth evince that that service ought to have been performed, and as an
  answer also to the fourth question of the abovenamed enquirers with the ground
  thereof which is this <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny blame and reprove
 bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers because they do not practise, sub mit to, or come under
 laying on of hands.</hi> Therefore we desire to know of them, if they can tell
 of any of the servants of Christ, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or blame any sort of
 peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether baptized or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ot,
 because lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands was not practised, or submitted to by
 them.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place we find it most expressely asserted that
  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them that they might receive the
  holy spirit, and laid their hands on them i. e. all those men and women (for
  thats the only substantive to this pronoun <hi>them</hi> in that place, of whom
  its said before that they <hi>were baptized in the name of the Lord Iesus:</hi>
  which word <hi>only they were baptized</hi> intimates to us thus much also,
  <hi>viz.</hi> that though they had submitted so far as to baptism, yet they had
  not practised all that was to be practised by them, but that some other service
  was yet behind, which ought to be performed towards them, <hi>viz.</hi> that of
  laying on of hands.</p>
               <p>In the fourth its asserted also most plainly that all the three
  thousand believers that were baptized did gladly receive the word, i. e. the
  word that Peter preacht to them, who exhorted them with many other words then
  those that are there spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, <hi>viz.</hi> repentance and baptism, and that

  at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> before, from whence they came immediately to
  <hi>Samaria,</hi> where its easie to be discerned by any but such as will bend
  their brains to multiply impertinencies, and to make bluries to themselves, and
  others in businesses that are beyond doubt to impartial inquirers, that they
  laid hands, praying for them that they might receive the holy spirit, on all
  those believers there that were baptized, whether men or women without

  in the name of the Lord Jesus v. 16. and the same persons that are denoted by
  that pronoun them v. 14. 15. 16. as I am sure we cannot warrantably, because
  not congruously, do otherwise? for who else can be meant all along but the very

  ver. 15. <hi>that they prayed for them,</hi> and ver. 17. <hi>that they laid
  their hands on them,</hi> doth not <hi>them</hi> denote out the very same?</p>
               <p>Yet this cannot be digested for truth with some of the

  Scripture had expressions both particular, indefinite, and universal, that the
  word <hi>them</hi> here, as twas not a particular, so twas not an universal
  (for then it would have been said all them) but an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit expression,
  signifying some onely not all, whereby he bewrayed his too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquaintance
  with one received rule among the Rationallists, <hi>viz.</hi> that an
  in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite proposition, or expression in a necessary matter is equivalent ever
  to an universal: howbeit my reply to him then was not so, but on this wise,
  <hi>viz.</hi> that if we must take <hi>them</hi> but indefinitely only, for
  some and not all the persons or things before spoken of, unlesse that particle
  <hi>all</hi> be added to it, then we had consequently no clear command from
  <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. to baptize all that are discipled, and converted to
  the faith, for by the pronoun them, that is there used also, we must not mean
  <hi>all them,</hi> but <hi>some of them</hi> onely in the nations that are
  discipled, because its not said <hi>all them,</hi> but meerly <hi>them,</hi>
  but I intreated him from his conscience to tell me whether he did think, that
  when Christ saies <hi>Go teach all nations baptizing them, teaching them,</hi>
  he meant that they should baptize <hi>all them,</hi> or but some <hi>of
  them</hi> only in the nations that were discipled, his return was that if there
  were not other places that did more clearly prove it that Christ commanded that
  all should be baptized then <hi>Matth</hi> 28. he could not see it fully
  commanded there: and being desired to assign any place, wherein Christ did more
  universally command baptism then there, he directs us to <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 30.
  where its said the <hi>Pharisees rejected the Counsel of God against themselves
  in not being baptized:</hi> whence he gathered that baptism was the Councel,
  and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the commandement of God to all men, because they are here

  be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to all men, because the pharisees in particular (for the
  <hi>Pharisees</hi> is but a particular expression indigitating one single sort
  of men among all the rest, and not so much as an indefinit, much lesse an
  universal) because I say the Pharisees in particular are reproved for refusing
  to obey it, how much better may we collect that both baptism, and laying on of
  hands with prayer for the spirit, are commanded by God to all men, because we
  find all those, save <hi>Simon,</hi> (witnesse his giving them his holy spirit)

  <note n="*" place="margin">witness his reproving and threatning of

  to teach for doctrines of his the traditions or commandments of men: the
  <hi>Minor</hi> is as clear that the Apostles did not teach for doctrines of

  that he received from Christ that which he delivered unto the <hi>Church</hi>
  at <hi>Corinth,</hi> so may we say on the behalf of all the rest, as concerning
  what doctrines they delivered, and dispensations they practised to the
  Churches: for surely as Christ the great, and immediate messenger from the
  father could do nothing of himself, was not to do his own will, but the will of
  his father which sent him, nor to speak or do any thing, but as the father gave
  him commandement, confessing that even his doctrine was not his own, but his

  promising his presence in the observation of the same among his disciples, not

               </p>
               <p>Finally that laying on of hands on baptizd believers hath the
  same ends, grounds and reasons why it was to be used, continuing still to this
  very day, as much as <pb n="501" facs="tcp:42067:255"/> as in the primitive times, is as
  evident as all the rest: for as the grounds and reasons why they observed such
  a service then were, and could be no other then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of it to
  them from Christ to be his holy command, mind and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, and to
  be a certain outward administration of his own chusing, which though as
  despicable a dispensation, and as weak, low, foolish, earthen, and empty a
  thing to see to as wash in <hi>Iordan,</hi> yet was to be done, sith the Lord
  had bidden it to be done, as well, yea rather then if it had been some greater
  matter, if to no other end, then meerly to testify their love to him, and
  themselves meerly to be his disciples, servants, and friends by observing
  whatever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Iohn 14. 15. 21. 23. 15. 14 1 Iohn</hi> 5. 3. how
  much more when it was a way, and order of his own appointment to be observed,
  and to wait upon him in, together with prayer and supplication, in order to
  such a glorious and profitable end, and purpose to themward, as this, viz. that
  they waiting on him in that his own way, might (as not onely they did, but all
  others shall, that wait on him in the same in sincerity according to their
  faith, or else its possible that we may fail of it as they also might and did)
  in his measure manner and time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his holy spirit.</p>
               <p>Now (I say) as these were the ends, grounds and reasons, why
  among baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed believers this of laying on of hands was observed then, so
  there are the same ends, grounds and reasons, why the same service should be
  observed now,</p>
               <p>For first we have it manifested as sufficiently to our Reason
  and understanding (unlesse we will darken the councell of God to our selves by
  a number of needless queries, superfluous scruples, and words without
  knowledge) either expressely or by infallible inferences, and undeceivable
  deductions in the word to be an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repealed, undisannulled dispensation and
  part, and principle of Christs doctrine, will and Testament, as they had, and
  as baptism it self, which the Enquirers walk still in the practise of, is
  manifested so to be:</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are also as much required, and have as much reason
  as they to manifest our selves to be lovers of Christ, to be his disciples,
  servants, and friends by our readinesse to do whatsoever he hath commanded.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we are in as much liablenesse as they to be the least in
  the kingdome of heaven, if we break one of the least of Christ commandements,
  and teach men so i e. that they may do so too 
  <note n="*" place="margin">&amp; so the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers seem to me to do
 while they teach men that as yet have not, that they need or ought not to
 submit to prayer and laying on of hands for the holy spirit, and un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

 it, till they disown that first principle o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> the doctrine of Christ after they had once, even practically owned
 it.</note>, and as much capablenesse of being greatest in the kingdom of
  heaven, if we do the least of Christs commandements, and teach men so i. e.
  that they must do so too.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we have as much need of the holy spirit now as they
  had to perform the same good offices for us as he did for them <hi>viz.</hi> to
  comfort and support under sufferings, to lust against our flesh, to lead us
  into all truth, to bring to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the things that were spoken by
  Christ, which many men would fain have to be forgotten, to help to mortifie the
  deeds of our bodies to seal us up to the day of redemption, to reveal unto us,
  that we may rejoice therein, the things which are freely given us of God, which
  are the same he gives to them, and to gift us likewise with such gifts as he,
  not as we shall please 
  <note n="*" place="margin">who would fain be our own carvers, and
 either have such visible gifts, as some call them, as he was pleased to give
 them, or else we will be blind, and not see, nor believe, though we see it,
 that he gives any gifts of his spirit now at all;</note> (for beggers must not
  be chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers) for fellowship in the body, that we may be an habitation of God
  through the spirit, and to gift some also, even such as he pleases, for the
  work of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, and the edifying of the body in the several offices he
  hath given to it for the <pb n="502" facs="tcp:42067:256"/> service of it, and the truth
  <hi>viz.</hi> messengers, elders, deacons &amp;c. for all this he did for them.

               <p>Fifthly, we are as much under the promise of the same holy
  spirit of promise <hi>a</hi> being baptized believers, as they were <hi>b</hi>
  for the promise of it was to them that were far off as well as to them that
  were nigh, whether in respect of time or place, and therefore to us, yea, and
  to all men on the same terms on which it was tendred to them. <hi>c</hi> all

  it,</hi> all that <hi>obey him</hi> to the worlds end have on these terms a
  promise of the holy spirit as well as all the baptized believers of the
  primitive times, and why the baptized believers of these times should have all
  these ends, grounds and reasons why, and in order to which laying on of hands
  with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was dispenst on all baptized believers then, continuing till now,
  and yet that dispensation cease and not continue in its use; and that they
  should have the promise of the same spirit, and yet not be bound to wait on
  God, and seek it in the same way is a very riddle to me: I confesse there may
  be through the unbelief of baptized believers, who will not take Gods word in
  his word, but say shew us a sign that we may see and believe, shew us such
  visible gifts, shew us miracles, the gift of healing, and in particular that
  gift of tongues

 your unbelief.</note>; which thou gavest to baptized believers in the primitive
  times, in this way of prayer and laying on of hands, and we will submit to it,
  and believe it to be thy will and command to us now, else not: I say for their
  unbeliefs sake that obey not, and their too too great defect in faith that do
  draw neer to God in prayer and laying on of hands, there may be, and that
  justly, and I think is, a cessation of Gods giving out such measures and full
  manifestations of his spirit as else he would, yet some gifts he gives now, and
  that there is warrant to expect, by any promise thereof, some particular gifts
  that God, for signs of confirmation of the Gospel doctrine to be from heaven in
  the first giving of it out and removing the old testament, gave in the
  primitive times, as miracles, tongues, this I deny, but that he gives not the
  gift of the spirit, and the graces of it, which was the thing mainly promised,
  and not so much <hi>in plurali</hi> the gifts of it, as men count gifts
  distinct from the fruits of it <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. temperance, love, joy, peace,
  &amp;c. as if these were not the spirits gifts, much more that the promise of
  the self same spirit it self (though it appear not in every individual gift
  that we out of curiosity desire to see) doth not cease to us, and that there is
  no cessation of that outward administration of laying on of hands with prayer
  on baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, which Christ then was sought to in, for the fulfilling
  of his promise, this I dare, and do still affirm, and testifie, neith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r do I judge any man is capable by the
  word to give any sound reason why it should cease, it being a principle of the
  doctrine of Christ, till all the principles of the whole foundation spoken of
  <hi>Eph. 2. 20. Heb.</hi> 6. 1. 2. on which the visible Church is to be built,
  and all ordinances do cease also together with it at Christs next
  appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Thus having sufficiently proved the <hi>Minor</hi> of the
  forenamed argument in each <pb n="503" facs="tcp:42067:256"/> particular of it, in which as
  neerly as I could well croud them together are coucht as many, if not all such
  particulars as are needful to be proved to the evincing of the continuance of
  this doctrine and dispensation, of laying on of hands to the end,</p>
               <p>I shall hasten to an end both of this subject, and of this
  system also: but because I find some things put in by way of positive
  exception, and objection against this truth, from the mouthes of some, as well
  as something by way of query from the pens of others, who also in that way have
  appeared against it so newly at the the presse, <hi>viz.</hi> the late
  Enquirers above-named, a remnant of whose Questions remain yet unanswered here,
  though not so unanswerable as some do deem them, I shall adde a word or two
  more toward the removeal of these two sorts of blinding bushes, whereby
  <hi>I</hi> fear many may be infatua ted so as to turn aside from the way of
  truth in this particular, and so leave both it, and them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord.</p>
               <p>First then whereas by word of mouth some tell me, That
  <hi>Laying on of hands was a way peculier to that juncture, designed of god to
  the time then being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wherein the Apostles</hi> (say some and othersome
  the Lord) <hi>gave the holy spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in some visible eminent, and extraordinary
  gifts thereof, as tongues prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, miracles, healing &amp;c. simply to this
  end that these might be a sign to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it visibly to the eyes of people,
  that the doctrine they taught and practised in the principles, and other parts
  of it was from above, and no other then the oracles of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, I grant that in the primitive times, there were, and that
  in the way of prayer, and laying on of hands, given (not by the Apostles,
  though, for (as is shewed above) they were not baptizers with the spirit) but
  by the Lord onely, whose onely prerogative that is to baptize with the holy
  spirit, sundry gifts, as healing, &amp;c. which may be called extraordinary,
  and rare respectively to these times, wherein they have bin seldome or never
  seen, or heard of, as I know not that that of tongues now adaies ever was,
  though as to that of healing, and that of discerning of spirits, and some other
  manifestations of the spirit given to profit withall, as a word of wisdome, and
  a word of knowledge, it is within a little of past doubt to some that such as
  these, as the Lord pleases, are some lesse, some more frequently given now
  among them that walk in truth (though what gifts some have seen and been
  sensible of in others or themselves, tis not so fit to boast of, as to be
  silent.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, I grant that many of this sort (and hapily many more
  then either are, or need to be, or shall be given now) were given then
  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o confirm the New Testament
  doctrine in the first delivery of it to the world, in the room of the old one,
  to be of God, of some of which there may be a cessation, the end they had such
  special respect to then being sufficiently accomplished, and the word being now
  committed unto writing <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 17, 18, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3,
  4.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, that either such gifts of the spirit as these were
  either the onely or the chief kind of gifts of the spirit that were to be, and
  were expected, lookt after or given in that way of prayer and laying on of
  hands, as a service destinated <hi>pro tempore</hi> only in order to the
  receiving of such, or that these gifts were so extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in respect of the
  eminency or excellency of them (because more visible and <hi>ad extra)</hi>
  beyond such as may be warrantably by promise expected, and are in that way
  assuredly and ordinarily given at this day, these two I see no warrant to
  subscribe to: for as tis most sure that the promise was (so far as I find)
  <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> nor onely, nor so oft of these things (though I deny not
  but these were at that time, for ends that concern not these times promised
  too) but of the spirit to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other purposes (as above) the holy spirit,
  the spirit in the fruits, and graces, and comforts of it, the gift of the holy
  spirit we find it all along almost in no lesse then scores of Scriptures,
  whereof some few are more plain: so assuredly the <pb n="504" facs="tcp:42067:257"/> holy
  spirit in that way of prayer and laying on of hands was given to baptized

  those things that are more commonly, but not more properly, then those, called

  such a way, 
  <note place="margin">Ans.</note> but not himself, we are quaerying
  what we are required to do by him, upon the account of which we may by promise
  expect the holy spirit, not what God does; God often anticipates his own
  promise, and is better then his word as <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 47. he gave the
  spirit before baptism which is promised onely to baptized believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
  <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. yet that does neither give us disingagement from Gods
  outward way, nor warrant us to expect the spirit out of it, but ingage us so
  much the more unto it ver. 48.</p>
               <p>If God will give any other men his holy spirit out of that way,
  I am glad (sith it pleases himself) he is so good to them: but as that assures
  me not that I (spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if inlightned about his way, yea then assuredly I
  shall not) shall have it so too, so sure I am that in his way I shall obtain
  it, and if any have been so highly favoured of god, as that he mercifully meets
  them out of his way, that does not exempt them from comming into it, but much
  more oblige them, if they had no further need of it (as Christ had none of
  baptism, save to fulfill all righteousness) even meerly upon that account to
  meet him the more cheerfully in it: for thus it becometh us me thinks, as well
  as it did Christ himself to fulfil all the righteousnes of his law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="505" facs="tcp:42067:257"/> If any say, <hi>I deny not the

               <p>Secondly, if we must wait, as they did till the day of
  <hi>Pentecost,</hi> then we must till that time forbear all baptizing in water,
  and suspend all preaching to the world aswel as laying on of hands, but this
  though the Apostles did so in that juncture, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertime between Christs
  ascension, and the descension of the holy spirit, yet our Enquirers, among whom
  some of eminency object as abovesaid, 
  <note n="*" place="margin">which I much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at sith this
 objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on supposes a continuation, or resurrection of that same ordinance of
 laying on of hands in the last daies, after a whiles waiting for
 administrators: but the questions subscribed to, are all or most of them such
 as suppose the Enquirers to be much in the dark and in doubt about it, what
 kind of laying on of hands that is, thats called a doctrine of Christ
 <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. whether ever such a thing was, or is ever to be dispensed
 to all baptized believers &amp;c. as if they could not tell almost whether
 there be, at least appointed by Christ, such a manner of administration.</note>
  do in this time (I suppose) baptize, and increase their number by preaching the
  Gospel to the world.</p>
               <p>Thus far as to the objections: now as to what further
  obstructive interposal is made in way of question by the Enquirers, some of
  whose queries viz. the second fourth, seventh and eighth, I have taken notice
  of above, I shall now remove it by saying a little to the residue viz. the
  first, third, fifth, and sixth.</p>
               <p>The first which with the ground thereof is on this wise 
  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>viz.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are denied
 communion by some of those Churches, or by some members thereof, who hold the
 ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of all baptized believers to practise, submit to, or come under the
 laying on of hands. 
 <p>
                        <hi>Therefore we desire them to acquaint us what we are
commanded to say, or do, that we may be found faithful in that point; or
otherwise, to be discovered disobedient unto a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand by the Word of God,
which is the onely director here, and that which shall be our judge at the last
day.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> is rather a curious querk, then a solid question, so
  frivolous as is scarce fit to be answered with any thing, but not a word: yet a
  word neverthelesse even unto that.</p>
               <p>First, whereas they ground it upon our denial of communion with
  them, we desire them to know that we may more justly put the businesse of our
  <hi>non-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with them upon their score, and lay the deniall of it
  at their own doors as their doing, not ours.</p>
               <p>I say not ours, who earnestly desire to have communion even in
  one body with them, and all men in a way of conformity to the word of Christ,
  which gives neither example, nor toleration, so far as I know, for any mixt
  communion in one Church of persons, whereof some own all the principles of the
  doctrine of Christ, and some not only own not, but deny either all, or any of
  them; if it doth shew us where? but theirs who deny a part of that very
  beginning of the word of Christ, or first form of his doctrine, all the several
  parts wherof collective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="506" facs="tcp:42067:258"/> taken make that very
  foundation, upon the whole of which, and not part of it onely, every right
  visible Church is built, and constituted, and besides which there can be no
  orderly either Church or communion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas tis askt what persons are to say or do, (at
  the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of laying hands) that they may be found faithful in that
  point? I say that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 15. 17. the administrators are
  to pray for the baptized believers that they may, according to the promise
  <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. receive the holy spirit, and after that to lay their hands
  upon them, which is easiy enough (I wot) to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood without expressing
  what part of the body hands are to be laid on, whether the head (the place of
  our imposition, which if hands be laid on tis laying on of hands is it not?) or
  any other part 
  <note n="*" place="margin"> 
                     <p>which is the wise query of some also, and as learned a
question as if one should ask, whether at the supper we must put the elements
to our mouths with the right hand or the left? or in baptism ask, how the
baptizer must handle the person baptized, and where he must take hold on him,
when he dips him? and if he have not expresse Scripture concerning such
nicities and trifles as these, suspend the dispensation of both the supper
&amp; baptism, because Christ is som what short in his word, not expressing
punctually enough, how his ordinances shall be dispensed, nor what is to be
said and done by persons at the doing of them, so distinctly as they would have
him.</p> 
                     <p>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they
do gender strifes 2 Tim. 2. 23.</p>
                  </note>? and (as at baptism the believer is
  without gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying it, to yield his body to be baptized so) at laying on of
  hands, the baptized believer is to say nothing against it, but to give way to
  have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> done according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>The 3d. question with the ground thereof, which runs thus, 
  <note n="p" place="margin">

                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>. Seeing there be ma ny that do desire bapti zed believers to
 require that hands should be laid on them.</hi> Therefore we desire of them to
 shew us some place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (if they know of any) that doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse such
 a behaviour ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrator, or the person on whom hands were
 laid.</note> is even as super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, impertinent, vain and frivolous as the
  former; for (howbeit neither am I one of those many that have ever yet
  formally, and in terms desired baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to require that hands should
  be laid on them yet) laying on of hands on bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized believers either is
  Christs mind, or it is not, if it be not, and the Enquirers ever prove it is
  not, we will freely give them leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to let it alone, but if it
  be, (as tis proved to be above out of <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 16. 17. 19. 1. 2: 3. 6.

 their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse, and summon men to shew their forwardnesse to own Christs
 wayes may become any administrator whatsoever Act. 23. 16.)</note> if
  henceforward we desire baptized believers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it to be dispenst to
  them, so I give them to understand that, it being the mind of Christ, though
  (as baptism also is) one of his too too dispised dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as stout, and
  loath to stoop to it as some baptized believers seem to be, tis no
  disparagement to the best of them, that are yet (as those <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 16.)
  onely baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, but a behaviour that may well
  enough beseem them to require it.</p>
               <p>The fifth question is ushered in by an introduction, consisting
  of nothing but division and subdivision of laying on of hands into different
  kinds, according to the difference of the administrators, of the persons to
  whom, of the accounts or ends upon which, and in order whereunto administred,
  as it followes in their own words thus viz <hi>we do or may read of laying on
  of hands upon severall occasions, differ ing one from the other,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, in the qualification of the administrator, as Luke
  21. 12. compared with Mark 16, 18. the one being wicked, the other
  Godly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, differing qualifications in persons on whom hands
  were laid, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before baptized, and sometimes after baptism, Act. 9. 17.
  and Acts</hi> 8. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, hands were imposed upon several accounts (or ends;)
  sometimes to be brought before Rulers, as Luke 21. 12. sometimes to heal the
  sick, Acts 28. 8. sometimes te cure the blind, Act. 9. 17. sometimes to set men
  apart to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister temporall things Acts 6. 6. sometimes to set men apart to
  administer <pb n="507" facs="tcp:42067:258"/> spiritual things Act. 13. 3. these were
  gifted, before hands were laid on them, Sometimes hands were imposed, that men
  might be gifted, 1 Tim. 4. 14. sometimes hands were laid on by men gifted, to
  give the holy ghost to them that were not set a part to Office, as many of
  themselves say from Acts 8. 17.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After which their question with its ground comes in thus.

 did Job, Job 1. 12. Job 2. 6. 7.</note> in the several seasons of before and
  after baptism, to and upon several ends, purposes, and accounts, though all the
  several ends and cases you here distinguish by do not make so many several
  kinds of imposition of hands neither, so substantially distinct each from other
  as you would seem to make them; for imposition of hands on baptized believers
  before admission, and after that before ordination to office, were one and the
  same in kind, distinguished onely by the different capacities of membership,
  and ministership, eldership, messengership, to each of which laying on of hands
  was Antecedent, yea these were one, and the same kind of imposition of hands,
  used all in order to one and the same end in general <hi>viz.</hi> receiving
  the holy spirit, or, as occasion was, more and more of the spirit, in a measure
  answerable to their places, diversified onely by the different degrees or
  stations in the Church to which they were thereby visibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed: but what
  if there were never so many kinds of laying on of hands, is it therefore so
  impossible to determine (as by your query you seem to imagine) which among all
  the rest is meant in such or such a place? shall we think the Apostles meant to
  deliver the mind and doctrine of Christ, and that in the very principles or
  first rudiments of it too, which ought to be the plainest, in such obstruse,
  dark and ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>igmatical wayes that
  men should scarcely be capable possibly to know what they meant? theres several
  sorts of baptism spoken of in the Scripture, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so difficult (if
  men be not willing (as some are) to puzzle themselves besides the practise of
  water baptism) to know when he speaks of water, when of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when of

               <p>But to the question<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ith some will needs, though needlesly, query which of all these
  layings on of lands the Scripture speaks of is called the foundation, principle

               <p>I answer that laying on of hands that twas dispensed with prayer
  on baptized believers, not as yet to be set apart to office, mentioned
  <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 15. 16. 17. not in order to gifted mens giving it (for though
  you will mistake us do whatwe can, and bring us in as confessing it here, yet
  we ever utterly deny that any men were ever so gifted as that they could give
  it) but in order to Gods giving, and our receiving the holy spirit from the
  Lord, that laying on of hands I say is it which in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. 2. is
  called a principle, a part of that foundation of Christs doctrine on which the

               <p>Thus much concerning the continuation of that practise of laying
  on of hands: now as to the present use of the ordinances of breaking of bread,
  and church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, I shal speak but briefly to that forasmuch as these are
  services the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which to the end is denied doctrinally by none
  (for ought I know) but the Ranter, that is run up above all, saving that the
  Rigid Piesbyterians, though in words they own the supper, yet in works do deny
  it, for many if not most of them live in the neglect of that administration of
  the supper, in their parishes some four; some five, some six, seven, eight
  years without any use of it at all, as if there were no such matter as that now
  in being; for others, I mean a certain mixt sort of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents that are rife
  in these dayes, they own and practise it and Church fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship too more then
  enough, unlesse more orderly in respect of that Antecedency to these of all the
  principles of the doctrine of Christ, which ought to be now as it was in the
  primitive times, which times they pretend to reform by, taking in <hi>Omnium
  generum,</hi> an Omnigatherum of persons, men and women, whom they take to be
  believers, into fellowship in one visible body in breaking of bread and
  prayers, some whereof, having renounced their Rantism as null, are truly
  baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; some as yet but meerly Rantized, yet supposing themselves
  sufficiently bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized because of that, which can be of no use to them as a
  sign, for they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it not; some hanging in the air between both, not
  satisfied, whether they were truly baptized in infancy yea or no; some doubting
  whether any water bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism at all be needful to be used in these times; some
  convinc't that they ought to be baptized, but not yet finding any
  Administrator, that fits their fancies; some resolved to be baptized, but
  Christ, who expects it from them, must wait their leasure, none reproving their
  procrastination, nor saying to them, as <hi>Ananias,</hi> to <hi>Paul, and now
  why tarriest thou? arise and be baptized, and wash away thy sins calling on the
  name of the Lord, or as Peter to the Iews repent and be baptized;</hi> Some
  resolving never to be baptized, but roundly renouncing all water baptism as
  nothing concerning them, yet leaving them at liberty to act according to their
  light, that have a mind to submit to it, and who see it their duty as if the
  plain word of Christ in this point of baptism were such a nose of wax, as might
  be moulded, and metamorphosed into any model according to every mans mind and
  temper, or quite canceld, disanuld, melted into no word of Christ at all at
  every mans haughty humour, that is loath to debase himself so far as to
  submission to it, as if my Lord, and my Lady, and Sir such a one had more
  dispensation from Christ thenevery ordinary body, to shew for their
  non-obedience to that dispised dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; some of them, that are baptized,
  under prayer and imposition of hands in order to their obtaining the spirit of
  promise; some not having faith in the thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that baptism with the
  spirit <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. and <hi>Iohn</hi> baptist
  <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. doth belong to them or no, though there promised to all
  that are, and shall be (repenting and believing) baptized in water, even as
  many as the Lord shall call, whereupon the fourth principle of Christs
  doctrine, will not down with them, but when they come to that lesson in Christs
  A B C they must skip it, and take forth, and, because it likes them not, turn
  ore a new leaf to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the supper, and Church fellowship before
  they are prefecty past their primmer: to all which confused <hi>pro</hi> and

                  <pb n="511" facs="tcp:42067:260"/> But now as to the question, whether these
  two (for I must scarce speak of these severally, but very succinctly, and as it
  were together) are of right, and according to the mind, and word of Christ to
  continue to the end? in proof hereof <hi>viz.</hi> that they are, I shall refer
  the Ranter, and the rest (if any other besides him do deny it) but to two
  Scriptures, which prove each of these respectively, and remove some few more of
  such exceptions as are made against the present practise of both these two, and
  the other two parts of Christs outward worship and service I have already spoke
  to, and so put a period to this discourse:</p>
               <p>The first is 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 26. for as often as you eat this
  bread and drink this cup ye shew</hi> (or shew ye, for the word may be read
  imperatively, as well as indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) <hi>the Lords death till he come,</hi>
  in which words tis so clearly supposed, that the ordinance of the supper is not
  according to Christs will to cease till the next ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Christ, that it
  were to suppose a man to be void of sense, and reason to undertake to make it
  more evident to him by framing any formall argument from the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Second is Heb. 10. 25. not forsaking the assembling of
  our selves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another while
  its called to day; and so much the more by how much you see the day
  approaching,</hi> where it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so most clear, and undeniable, that tis the
  mind of Christ, that the Saints should keep together in one body in assemblies,
  and fellowships one with another, and that his sheep should not live in such a
  stragling state and conditon, such single fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship between God and
  themselves onely, as is now pleaded for by many, that fall off from following
  or frequenting any societies at all, and forsake such truly constituted
  Churches as they were once added to, which argues apparently that (as we say of
  sheep when they keep not with the flock, but are found squotting up and down
  here and there by themselves alone and aloof from their fellows) that some ill
  disease and deadly distemper is growing upon them, but that they should keep
  together in flocks every sheep following the footsteps of the flock, which name
  of flock is that by which Christ often denominates his sheep, as <hi>Luke 12.
  32. Act. 20. 28. 1 Pet.</hi> 5. 2. to shew that he expects to find them in
  flocks and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships at his coming.</p>

                  <hi>Till he come is no other then till his coming into men by
  his spirit, or in such full measures and manifestations of his spirit into mens
  hearts, that they may be able to live up with him in spirit, so as no more to

  such visible represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Christ to the bodily eyes such legal rites and
  meer bodily exercises as baptism and fellowship together in breaking of bread
  are.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>These things were used indeed, and ordained as milk for
  babes in that meer nonage and infancy of the Church, when Christ was known as a
  child as it were, but now we are to know Christ as a man grown in us, risen up
  in us, and to have fellowship with him more immediately and intimately in
  spirit, and not in such external, and meer fleshly formes; we are to live
  higher then on such low, weak, empty, elements, and beggarly rudiments as
  these, which were used, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for a time to resemble Christ to us from
  without, but must be left when once Christ, the substance, that was set forth
  by those shadows, is come into us. Christ is now in the Saints the hope of
  glory, Col. 1. 27. So Heb. 6. 1. 2. leaving the principles of the doctrine of
  Christ let us go on to perfection, not laying again &amp;c. you see we must
  mind higher matters leaving these, which were as a dark glasse, or shadowy
  dispensation, through which the Church once did see Christ, and knew him after
  the flesh, but now face to face, 1 Cor. 13. 12. and hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know we him so
  no more, 2 Cor. 5. 16. when I was a child, saies Paul, I spake as a child, and

  morning star shined, to which men did well to take heed, as unto a light that
  shined in a dark place, but now the day dawnes, and the day starre arises in

  related simply to the law, as they did not, yet that of laying on of hands, and
  Church-fellowship in breaking bread, were all given in charge by the new
  law-giver Christ Jesus, and that of water baptism too, for (as if he had
  foreseen that some should delude themselves and others, so as to say it ended
  at his death) even that also was given a new after his death, as his expresse

               <p>Thou tellest us that to use ordinances is to know Christ after

  Christ after the flesh,</hi> he means not a knowing of him in the use of
  ordinances (for then when he saies hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know we no man after the flesh,
  it must have the same sense too, and would suppose that till that time the
  Saints had known men in the use of ordinances; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that the Church at
  <hi>Corinth</hi> knew Christ in the use of ordinances long after this, is

  Churchat <hi>Rome,</hi> written to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> upon occasion of
  their disorder in church affairs, some 30 years after <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this)
  but he means that they, from thenceforth that Christ died, did take cognizance
  of no man as ere the better, upon the account of a meer fleshly descent, or
  birth of any mens bodies, no not of <hi>Abrahams,</hi> as they had before, nor
  count men in Christ, and Christians at such a rate as they were counted to God,
  as his, under the Law, but onely as new born, spiritually born from above, as
  new creatures, as believing according to <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. 13. and

               <p>Thou tellest us that ordinances are as it were a dark glasse,
  through which we are to behold Christ, till we come to see him face to face, a

  that must be put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, when once we become men, things imperfect, and in part
  onely, which when that which is perfect is come must vanish, and be done away

  contend for: for sith we yet see not face to face (1 <hi>Pet. 1. 8. in whom

  to begin first in his ABC, not that those, that will begin to build themselves
  an holy temple in the Lord, an habitation of God through the spirit, must not
  now lay any foundation at all, but that having laid the foundation they should
  not think that their building is at an end, but build up higher, grow up higher
  in Christ thereupon, that they should lay the foundation so sure at first that
  they should not have need in respect of their non proficiency or relapses into
  sin, to be laying these i. e. faith of remission, repentance &amp;c. ore and

  babes, feeding on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but milk, but growing in grace, and in the knowledge
  of Christ, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to bear stronger meats, higher doctrines: that the

  abstinences from meats, lent'n, and good friday fasts, and such ordinances, as
  touch not, tast not &amp;c. which men sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themselves to after the

  mostly in such matters 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 3. 4. 7. 8. Col.</hi> 2. 20. 21. 22.</p>
               <p>Thou tellest us (as one of the main grounds, whereupon there
  must now be no more walking in ordinances, and that way of outward service that
  was at first) that it was foretold 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3. that there should
  come a falling away from it, and a treading down of all that outward form,
  which then was: which (to say nothing how probable it is that that prophecy 2
  <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3. and several more, do point more at that falling away that
  thou (oh false prophet) shalt cause in the very last dayes, then at that which
  by the proud P P Priesthood hath been made before thee) I declare to be such an
  absurd and senslesse consequence, as is more worthy of a silent sleighting,
  then a solid answer; for if that be of force to prove a disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling of that
  administration, then its of force much more against the acting of faith it
  self, for as its not said there from what the falling away should be, so its
  expressely said elsewhere there should be a departure from the faith, 1
  <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. 2. so that if the foretelling that there should be a
  falling away from the truth of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, prove that therefore there must be
  no practising of them now at all, then there being a prophecy of a falling away
  from the right belief of the Gospel, will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that there ought now to be no
  right believing, and so belike we do as ill in believing the Gospel now, as in
  practising the ordinances of it: but this will not not hold, and therefore
  certainly not the other.</p>
               <p>More over (that thou maiest see how contrary thou art to the
  Apostles, not in thy actings only, but in thy arguings also) consider that
  whereas thou admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishest men thereupon to be carelesse as concerning
  ordinances, they even from their own predictions of a falling away from the
  purity of the primitive way, stir the Saints up to so much the more dilligent
  and strict attendance to it, <hi>Iude</hi> ver. 3. 4. from the very
  consideration of a future falling away exhorts the Saints, not therefore to let
  go, but earnestly to contend for that faith, which was once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the
  Saints; and I appeal to the understanding of any one, that hath not shut up his
  eyes from seeing and searching after the mind of God in the Scripture, whether
  <hi>Paul</hi> doth not charge <hi>Timothy 1 Tim. 4 16. 5. 21. 6. 13. 1
  Tim.</hi> 3. 14. (to whom he had told it before in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. that
  there should be a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the faith) even therefore (as he would answer
  it before God) to observe those things concerning outward discipline, and
  Church order, offices, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in point of laying on of hands, and other
  things, of that kind as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he in the name of the Lord had
  commanded him, and to keep them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot and unrebukeable even to the
  appearing of Jesus Christ, and not onely to continue himself in the doctrine,
  and things that he had learnt from <hi>Paul,</hi> among which many were
  instructions for the right ordering of Churches 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. but also
  to take special order for the continuation thereof downwards to succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
  generations without the least hint of any term or period of time, wherein they
  of right should cease: <hi>the things which thou hast heard of me among many
  wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, that shall be able (i.

  onely so, but whether he doth not in that very place thou alledgest <hi>viz. 2

  or ordinances (for so the same word <gap reason="foreign">

  which is used here, is truely enough rendred 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2.) because he
  had told them above that there should come one, that should delude many with
  lyes? whereas if <hi>Paul</hi> had argued as thou <hi>O Reasonlesse</hi> doest,
  he must have said thus <hi>viz.</hi> there shall come a falling away from the
  purity of ordinances, by a wicked one that shall tread them down, therefore be
  not too stuff in standing for them, but let go the ordinances which have been
  taught you whether by word or Epistle: <hi>Peter</hi> also foreseeing, and
  accordingly foreshewing, that there should come scoffers in the last daies
  walking after their own lusts, not Christs commands, wills the Saints that
  should be in those last times, as <hi>Malachi</hi> did the Jewes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long
  deformation, to remember the Law of Moses with the statutes and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
  <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 4. in which we now live, to look back to and be mindful of the
  words that were spoken before, by the holy prophets, and the commandments of
  the Apostles of the Lord and Saviour, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 2. as <hi>Iude</hi>
  also does in the self same words, and upon the self same account <hi>Iude</hi>
  17. And this I find to be the course of the Apostles all along, upon foresight
  of the dark and declining time, to refer the Saints of the last times to their
  primitive orders, and by Arguments drawn from the stedfastnesse of the word of
  the old Testament, in every tittle, to shew much more a stedfastnesse in the
  new, and a liablenes to punishment for every transgression, and disobedience to
  this, as there was for that, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 2-10. 28. every jot of which was
  so stedfast, that even tith of <hi>Mint, Annis</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> which
  the Pharisees did ill indeed in so doting upon, as to neglect the weightier
  matters of judgement, mercy &amp;c. was neverthelesse not to be neglected
  <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. on pain of being accounted Robbers of God <hi>Mal.</hi>
  3. 8. and howbeit the greater, and higher things of the Gospel, as faith,
  holinesse of life &amp;c. are not to be forgotten, while we attend to lesser
  and lower, yet how the law of Christ was so stedfast as that of <hi>Moses,</hi>
  if it ly in the power of man or Angel to disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul the least particle of it,
  till Christ himself, who is the only abolisher of old dispensations, and
  establisher of new, do, by his own next personal comming, put an end to this,
  as he did by his first comming unto that, I am not able to imagine.</p>

  the true appointed way of Gods worship was lost, when it should have been,

  be? surely the same rule, reason, warrant and command by which the Church was

  she now bound to rise from whence she is fallen, or else I know not what Christ

  <hi>Babylonians,</hi> the Priesthood and his people, that have led the Church

  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take <pb n="519" facs="tcp:42067:264"/> her self to her own border from whence she was

  and service, which were all by violence trod down, and caused to cease for a
  time, times and an half, for 42. moneths or a 1260. years, as that which by the
  might of men suppressing it, hath lost not a jot of its right, as that which is
  required of us now, as the other was of them, till Christ by his first comming
  put an end to that administration, as he shall by his second unto this.</p>
               <p>Thou tellest us no, there is not the same reason, Because,</p>
               <p>First it was foretold that they should return again after a set
  period of time, and how long <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should be trodden under foot,
  even for seventy years, and after that be built, and her old form of worship
  restored.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they had extraordinary prophets <hi>Haggai</hi> and
  <hi>Zachary</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them, and dictate to them the mind of God in those
  things they did from God.</p>
               <p>But I tell thee (and thou wouldest see it thy self but that thou
  art minded to be blind) First, those Prophets spake nothing as by command from

the growth of Anabaptism,</hi> the drift of it whether it be more to decline,

is the sense of the <hi>Scribes</hi> that scraped it, sometimes as it were
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying disputation as dangerous, and that from which tis scarce possible to
expect any good, and superscribing it self thus, viz. <hi>Why Hereticks are not

again, as if it meant to move the Ministers, though worsted, by no meanes to
give out, and to make it good that much good may be expected from it, like

<hi>Bonum,</hi> but not <hi>Bene, Rectum,</hi> but not <hi>Recte;</hi> it is a
moddle of (for the most part) right, good, true, and honest matter, onely made
use of either very simply or very subtly, to a bad end, <hi>viz.</hi> the
provoking of the Priesthood (no need to bid mad folks run) to preach up a

               <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> is, discover plainly,</p>
            <p>First that the people whom you call <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> upon
account of meer dissent and separation from you in the point of baptism, are no
<hi>Hereticks</hi> nor <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> but the truest visible Church
that Christ hath upon the earth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that you the <hi>P P Priesthood</hi> of the Nations, who
dissent from them in that point, are, as to that point at least, the veriest
<hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks</hi> your selves.</p>

addresse my self, by way of Peraphrase upon your own pathetical and

to believe and practise contrarily thereunto, against all manifestations of the
truth, whereby to reduce and reclaim them, and do also rend from and make a

baptize believers, that are thus gone off and divided from the primitive faith
and practise, from the true head of that Church, from the true foundation i. e.
the doctrine of the Apostles <hi>Eph. 2. 20. Heb.</hi> 6. 1. 2. and from
fellowship with, and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the true Church in baptism and otherwise,
is evident to him that is not blind or blear-eyed; for verily the water baptism
which we dispense is abundantly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above to be that one baptism
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4. which was used in the primitive times, then which there is no
other water baptism, enjoined or exemplified in the word as Christs ordinance
to his disciples <hi>viz.</hi> the burying of new born babes i. e believers in
water, and bringing them up again in token of Christs death, burial and
resurrection, and of their dying to sin, and rising to newnesse of life, this I
say is that one onely baptism the Churches then practised, and thus, and no
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise do we at this day, for which the word is our warrant; yea it is that
faith which was once delivered unto the Saints, that we now contend for, and
the words which were spoken before by the Apostles of the Lord, as we are

are we from erring, and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing from the Church, that we of all men do
stand for a full reformation in faith, practise, doctrine, discipline, worship,
manners, government and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism according to the word of God, and the example

wickedly indeed, yet those lascivious wayes, he laies to our score, are lesse

<hi>Preheminence</hi> the Pope: But now as for your selves, the PPPriesthood of
the Nations, who mostly deny not, but that the primitive baptism was of
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and dispenst in Rivers, or places of much water, which was
needlesse if sprinkling was then the way, you have a thing among you indeed,
which you call Baptism, but tis not that one Baptism, that old Baptism then
urged and used, but another, a new Baptism, and yet to say the truth, neither
another nor A new Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, but A-no-Baptism, Rantism, Babism, a toy of your
own taking up by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from your forefathers, but not the first fathers
that were the founders of the Christian Church, for you find it not there, but
fetch it further from thence, by such consequence as, besides the remotnesse of
it, is too weak and rotten to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it downwards to these times; you are they
that dissent, and rend from the truth in this point of baptism, and draw all
the world to <hi>Sectarize,</hi> and erre after you by a law, by your
<hi>subpaena</hi> directories; yea you pretendedly reforming Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who
peculiarize the term of Orthodox to your selves, even you, as to the right
administration of the outward right of baptism, are not a whit lesse Erratical,
Heretical, Schismatical and Heterodox then the <hi>Pope,</hi> for as he hath
another bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism then that, which was in the primitive times <hi>viz.</hi>
infant rantism, which, by the mouth of his cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he
confesses to be but a tradition of the Church, so you have no other then the
same, yea you own that for good baptism, which is done at <hi>Rome,</hi> or
else how to prove the Popish Bishops to be baptized themselves, that baptized,
and ordained you Presbyters, you plainly know not; yet you falsely father it
upon Christ, and fain it to be an ordinance of his, then which nothing is more
clear then that it is not.</p>
            <p>And as in point of baptism you all erre, not knowing, or at least
not doing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, all means used to reduce you thereunto
notwithstanding, so in the supper, and many more matters pertaining to that
visible Church order that was in those times, as namely impropriating to your
selves sole power of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in your Churches, i. e. steeple-houses, so that
your members may well say <hi>men mutire nefas?</hi> it is not for them to open
their mouthes there, unlesse to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer when you catechise them; whereas then
all the Church were to covet to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie i. e. to speak mutually to the
exhortation, edification, and comfort each of other, and being gifted, might
all (women onely excepted) prophesie one by one, and every one minister as of
the ability God gave them, great or small, that God in all things might be
glorified, and all judge of the doctrine delivered; but with you what doctrine
ere ye deliver, men may try it if they will, but must take it whether they will
or no, the mouths of all must be muzzled up, save such as (in your sense) are
ministers i. e. have some <hi>Parchment Preachment</hi> orders to shew from
such, as can shew their orders from his Highnesse the head of the Church, not
Christ but his Holinesse the <hi>Pope,</hi> who had his from the beast
<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. who <pb n="527" facs="tcp:42067:268"/> had his from the devill
<hi>Rev.</hi> 13. yea verily, as to the external face, and fashion of the first
Churches, you have altogether altered it, from what it was, and brought in a
businesse of your own heads, being all gone aside, and altogether become vain
in your wayes, as to your administrations of Gospel ordinances, so that there
is none of you that are in the right way of the primitive Churches, no not one:
yea ye are separated from and make a head against the true head of the Church
Christ Jesus, and take upon you to head the Church your selves, for this is not
the fault of <hi>P</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> onely; but of <hi>PP</hi> i. e. you
Prelates and Presbyters too, who howbeit you seem to throw off that supremacy,
or headship which the <hi>Pope</hi> had once, and laies claim to still in the
protestant part of Christ'ndom, yet in your seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Christ'ndoms you have been
(not nominally but) really as supreme in Church work as he, and that not over
the people onely, but civil powers also, to whom in all cases Ecclesiasticall
and civill, though you say you grant the headship or Supreame Government under
Christ, yet how doth that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, sith they only <hi>Corrective,</hi> but you
<hi>Directive,</hi> till of late, have done all? for the Bishops, and Sinods,
and General Convocations of the Clergy, and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Kirk,
<hi>seeundum te;</hi> must determine what is to be done by Magistrates in
Church affairs, and they do it accordingly; The Priests must give out the word
and sentence what is the worship, the way, the faith, the truth, what
<hi>Heresy,</hi> and <hi>Schism,</hi> who are <hi>Hereticks</hi> and
<hi>Schismaticks,</hi> and then the Princes in all their Dominions establish
the one, and root out the other, as Rogues, at their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, in which
cases, saving the bare name of supremacy over the Churches, which hath been
allowed, it is difficult to me to discern, whether Christian Kings have not
been, as of old under the Popedome, so more lately under the very Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Clergy, as the Bosholder under the Constable, at his discretion &amp; direction
to whip the beggars: and though you may say, and so saies the Pope too, that
you claim to head and order the Church <hi>directive</hi> no otherwise then
under Christ, yet in very deed as he, for all his saying, so you have presumed
to set your selves above Christ, the only head, Counseller, Lord and Lawgiver
to his Church, for as the Pope hath done no more then broken his lawes, changed
his ordinances, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled his truth, made void his commandments, and
<hi>subpaena damni Temporalis, et eternae damnationis,</hi> imposed mens
Traditions arrogantly in their stead, so you in your severall lines have done
no lesse; yea you also make people to erre with all your might, and whatever
tender consciences find Christ piping to the contrary in his word, yet if they
dance not after you pipe, when it sounds to the tune of Tithes, and put not
into your moneths, you cry peace, but bite with your teeth, and prepare war
against them: <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. 5. possessing the world with prejudice against
them as a sort of seditious Sectaries, damnnble <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and
<hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> yea <hi>(exceptis excipiendis)</hi> saving some few
scatterings here and there of more sober and moderate minded Ministers, like so
many graines of salt to keep the rest from stinking too much in these states,
where you have, or would have raigned, who have not been so hot spur as their

are you from due administration of the sacraments (giving the Supper to such as
were never at all, much lesse truly, baptized, &amp; many of you Presbyterians
not administring it at all to your flocks, whom you contend were truely
initiated into your Church by baptism) that indeed as you have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted

proclaiming us <hi>Schismatical hereticks</hi> for declining your disorderly
administrations, and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our covenant, pressing on to that purity of
administration of Gospell ordinances, which lies now in such plain English

there is no danger therefore of being rent from the Church of Christ, in
departing from participation with you in your oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions

indeed the Common tone of all you Romanists each to other, in your rendings

            <p>My answer then to the whole <hi>PPPriesthood</hi> of Christ'ndom,
even ye Protestant <hi>Clergy</hi> also, from all whom, as well as from the

charged as <hi>Schismatical Hereticks</hi> for so doing, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of the

<hi>Clergy</hi> do make in your own defence, when you are charged by your old
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and his <hi>Catholicks,</hi> as <hi>Hereticks</hi>
and <hi>Schismaticks</hi> in your rending from them, and as infringers of the
unity of their Church, yea in the very words of <hi>Calvin,</hi> to whom you my

            <p>
               <hi>They do indeed gloriously set out their Church unto us, that
there should seem to be no other Church in the world, and afterward, as though
the victory were gotten, they decree that all be Schismaticks that dare
withdraw themselves from the obedience of that Church that they paint out, and
that all be Hereticks that da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e
once mutter against the doctrine thereof. But by what proofs do they confirm
they have the true Church?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>S. 1. If the true Church be the pillar and stay of the truth,
it is certain, that there is no Church, where lying and falshood have usurped
the dominion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>S. 3. There is therefore no cause, why they should any longer
go forward to deceive by pretending a false colour under the name of the
Church, which we do reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteem, as becommeth us; but when they come to
the definition of it, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly water (as the common saying is) cleaveth unto
them, but they stick fast in their own mire, because they put a stinking harlot
in place of the holy spouse of Christ: that this putting in of a changling
should not deceive us, be side other admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, let us remember this also
of</hi> Augustine, <hi>for, speaking of the Church, he saith: it is it that is
sometime darkned and covered with multitude of offences, as with a cloud:
sometime in calmnesse of time appeareth quiet and free: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time is hidden and
troubled with waves of tribulations and temptations. He bringeth forth
examples, that oftentimes the strongest pillars either valiantly suffered
banishment for the faith, or were hidden in the whole world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>S. 4. In like manner the Romanists do vex us, and make afraid
the ignorant with the name of the Church, whereas they be the deadly enemies of
Christ. Therefore although they pretend the Temple, the Priesthood, and other
such out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shews, this vain glistering, wherewith the eyes of the simple be
dazled ought nothing to move us to grant that there is a Church, where the Word
of God doth not appear; for this is the perpetual mark wherewith God hath
mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to he his. He that is of the truth (saith he) heareth my voice.
Again, I am the good shepheard, and I know my sheep, and am known of them, my
sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, And a little before
he had said, that the sheep follow their shepheard, because they know his
voice: but they follow not a stranger, but run away from him because they know
not the voice of strangers. Why are we therefore wilfully mad in judging the
Church, whereas Christ hath marked it with an undoubtful sign, which
wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is seen cannot deceive, but that it certainly sheweth the
Church to be there, but where it is not, there remaineth nothing that can give
a true signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, for</hi> Paul <hi>rehearseth that the Church
was builded, not upon the judgements of men, nor upon Priesthoods, but upon the
doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets, but rather</hi> Jerusalem <hi>is to be
severally known from</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon, <hi>and the Church of Christ from the
conspiracy of Satan, by that difference <pb n="530" facs="tcp:42067:270"/> wherewith Christ
hath made them different one from another. He that is of God (saith he) heareth
the words of God, ye therefore hear not, because ye are not of God. In summe,
forasmuch as the Church is the kingdom of Christ, and he reigneth not but by
his word, can it be now doubtful to any man, but that those be the words of
lying, by which Christs kingdome is feigned to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his scepter, that is
to say without his holy word?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>But now whereas they accuse us of Schism and Heresie,
because we both teach a contrary doctrine to them, and obey not their lawes,
and have our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies to prayers, to baptism, to the ministration of the
supper, and other holy doings, severally from them: it is indeed a very sore
accusation, but such as needeth not a long or labor some defence: they are
called Hereticks and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, which making a division, do break in sunder
the communion of the Church. And this communion is holden together with true
bounds, that is to say, the agreement of true doctrine, and brotherly charity,
whereupon</hi> Augustine <hi>putteth this difference betwixt Hereticks and
Schismaticks, that Hereticks indeed do with false doctrine corrupt the
purenesse of faith, but the Schismaticks sometime even where there is like
faith, do break the bond of fellowship. But this is also to be noted, that this
conjoining of charity so hangeth upon the unity of Faith, that faith ought to
be the beginning thereof, the end, and finally the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rule. Let us therefore
remember that so oft as the unity of the Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto us, this is
required, that while our minds agree in Christ; our wills also may be joined
together with mutual well willing in Christ, Therefore</hi> Paul <hi>when he
exhorteth us to that well willing, taketh for his foundation that there is one
God, one Faith and one Baptism. Yea wheresoever he teacheth us to be of one
mind, and of one will, he by and by addeth in Christ, or according to Christ,
meaning, that it is a factions company of the wicked, and not agreement of the
faithful which is without the word of the Lord.</hi>

the whole fountain of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, from the onely Bishoprick
of Christ, he afterward addeth the Church is but one, which spreadeth abroad
more largely into a multitude with increase of fruitfulnesse, like as there be
many sun beams, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> to be scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad by largeensse of overflowing
plenty, yet the unity abideth in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, take away a beam of the sunne
from the body, the unity suffers no division, break a branch from the tree, the
broken branch cannot spring, cut off the stream from the spring head, being cut
off it drieth up, so also the Church being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread with the light of the
Lord, is extended over the whole world: yet there is but one light that is
spread every where. Nothing could be said more fitly to expresse that
undividual knitting together, which all the members of Christ have one with
another; we see how he continually calleth us back to the very head. Whereupon
he pronounceth that Heresies and Schismes do arise hereof, that men do not
return to the original of truth, nor do seek that head, nor keep the doctrine
of the heavenly master, Now let them go and cry that we be Hereticks that have
departed from their Church: sith there hath been no cause of our estrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from them but this one, that they can in no wise abide the pure professing of
the truth: but I tell not how they have driven us out with cursings and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
execrations, Which very self-doing doth abundantly enough acquit us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they will also condemn the Apostles for Schismaticks, with whom we have all one
cause. Christ I say did foresay to his Apostles, that the time should come when
they should be cast out of the synagogues for his name sake. And those
Synagogues of which he speaketh, were then accounted lawful Churches. Sith
therefore it is evident that we be cast out, and we be ready to shew that the
same is done for the names sake of Christ; truly the cause ought first to be 
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:42067:270"/> inquired of, before that any thing be determined upon
us, either one way or other. Howbeit, if they will I am content to discharge
them of this point. For it is enough for me, that it behoved that we should
depart from them that we might come to Christ.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Therefore it is needful to depart from the consent, of those
assemblies, which were nothing else but a wicked conspiracy against God. In
like manner if any man acknowledge the assemblies at these daies being defiled
with idolatry, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition and wicked doctrine, to be such in whose full

               <hi>S. 12. Whereas therefore we will not simply grant to the
Papists the title of the Church, we do not therefore deny that there be
Churches among them: but onely we contend for the true and lawful ordering of
the Church: which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the communion both of the Sacraments, which
are the signes of professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and also specially of doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hereby therefore appeareth, that we do not deny but that even
under his ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny remain Churches, but such as he hath profaned with
ungodlinesse full of sacriledge, such as he hath afflicted with outragious
dominations, such as he hath corrupted and in a manner killed with evil and
damnable doctrines, as with poison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed drinks: such wherein Christ lieth half
buried, the Gospel overwhelmed, godlinesse banished, the worshiping of God in a
manner abolished: such finally wherein all things are so troubled, that therein
rather appeareth the face of</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon <hi>then of the holy City of God.
Therefore because these marks are blotted out, which in this discourse we ought
principally to have respect unto, I say, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of their assemblies,
and the whole body wanteth the lawful form of a</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>These very words of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which are your defence, and
mine too against the Pope (O ye Protestant Priesthood) are mine also against
you, when you clamour against us as <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> for separating from
your Nationall Churches, and calling as many out with us as we can,
<hi>viz.</hi> because you two <hi>P P</hi> as well as the Popish Priesthood,
are not <hi>Syon,</hi> as you suppose, but two of those three parts of that
great City, <hi>Mystery Babylon the great, the Mother of Harlotry and Heresie,
that hath reigned over Kings and Kingdomes of the Earth:</hi> You hold not
unity with the head, you return not to the fountain of the truth, reform not by
the Primitive standard, but start aside like a broken bow; you hear not the
voice of our Prophet in all things he saies, but make void his lawes; you walk
not in those scorned, mean, base waies, which he hath chosen, but are they
rather that count them base, and so we can no more ioin with you then deny
Christ: &amp; so far are we from being <hi>Hereticks</hi> and
<hi>Schismaticks</hi> thereupon, that we rather truly declare you such as stand
divided from the Root, the Sun, the Fountain, as well as all three one from
another; yea what need we any further witness that you three
<hi>Hierarchies</hi> are all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi>
since the whole World hears it aloud out of your own mouthes? the Bishop saith
the Presbyter, as to his Government, is a <hi>Schismaticall Heretick,</hi> the
Presbyter saith the Bishop is so, the Pope saies they are both so, and they
both say he is so, and therefore I say they are all three so, if we may credit
what they say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves: you stand all divided from Christ, and the
Apostles, and now God hath justly divided you into three parts, and divided you
three miserably each against other among your selves, yea and sub-divided you;
<hi>i. e.</hi> divided his people, and well nigh all other people from you, so
that though you labour in the fire of wrath and rage, to bring them back to
unity with you, and their old blind conformity to your waies; yet you weary
your selves for very vanitie, for <hi>the earth <pb n="532" facs="tcp:42067:271"/> shall be

their national Church censures to be inflicted on the Saints, when they have
once blindly sentenct them to be <hi>Schismaticks</hi> to the civil power, if

and every true <hi>Heretick</hi> and <hi>Schismatick</hi> had his due too, good

mouthes to devastation, when the civil powers shall find them to be the
<hi>Arch-Hereticks</hi> in the world, if taking them at their word, they shall
do with them, as they say they ought to do in this case concerning others? but
God forbid that with what judgement they judge, they should be judged, and with
what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure they meet, it should be measured to them again at our suggestion,
if their own <hi>Cheek-by-jole</hi> carriage to the <hi>Stern-men</hi> of the
<hi>State</hi> do not pull it unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably upon themselves; yea verily though
as far as those that oppose themselves against the truth of Christ, they may
well challenge the name of <hi>Schismaticall Hereticks,</hi> and though
<hi>Amen</hi> might justly be said by the Magistrate in this point to the
opinion of <hi>Gangraena,</hi> and his <hi>Gang,</hi> and might <hi>Amen</hi>
be said to his wise wishes as concerning us, who teach and practise baptism in
its primitive fashion, we could expect to be suffered in the Common-wealth no
more then High-way Murderers, yet dare we not desire their extirpation out of
any of their native rights, in the several states, wherein they are, nor such
uncivill suppression of them, meerly for their erroneous Tenets, as they have
sollicited the higher powers to concerning us; we have not so learned Christ,
nor would they if they had heard him, and had been taught by him as the truth
is in Jesus: for howere it comes to passe that the <hi>C C Clergy</hi> (whose

so besotted as to believe that <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks</hi>

so peaceable and innocent must not onely be dischurched, but discommunicated
also from the patronage of the civil power, and cut off from the priviledges of

any order for such rigid rejection, indeed the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> wills in

verily they do (doctrinally at least) who teach such false doctrine, that men
of false relegions, whether heathens, Jewes, Turks, or Pagans, or men erring
most grosly about the true, as Papists, or whatever else, though never so
submissive in all civil things to the civil Powers, yet may not lawfully be
licensed to live in civil States, or in any Common-wealth under the Sun: for by
the same reason that <hi>Iews, Turks, Heathens, Hereticks</hi> may not without
sin, be tolerated in one Nation, but must <hi>(ex officio)</hi> be rooted out
of it, upon that meer account of denying and defying <hi>Christ,</hi> which is
as high as ever any <hi>Heretick</hi> went, they may not without sin be
permitted to be in another, and so either some nations must sin in allowing
these to live in them, or else, though <hi>de facto</hi> they cannot by reason
of their number, yet <hi>de jure</hi> they ought, as far as they well can, by
Kings and Princes, among whom few or none are so well acquainted, as they
should, with what is <hi>Heresie,</hi> and what truth, to be driven quite out
of the world; and so the poor <hi>Iewes</hi> whose conversion the Priests pray
for with much zeal and compassion, must in quiet live no where at all, that
they may be converted, but must belike be turned altogether into the sea.</p>
            <p>Besides the notion of their being Christians adds nothing to mens
power as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, so but that if such magistrates as are Christians, are
Church officers, as Magistrates, then other Magistrates, as heathen
Magistrates, must be Church officers as well as they, and then how well that

Church-officers are Heathens, a fool may see.</p>
            <p>Yet whether the Magistracy be Heathens, or Christians it matters
not to the <pb n="535" facs="tcp:42067:272"/> Church, so long as they are the ministers of

  yet judges the world as once he is to do, when the Kingdome appointed by the
  Father to him in reward of his for them, and by him to his disciples in reward
  of their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for him Luke 22. 28. is come, this I utterly deny; nay
  rather he is yet in his Saints an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derling to the civil powers; the miserable
  ignorance of which time wherein Christ shall take unto himself his great power
  and reign, and be <hi>de facto,</hi> as he was <hi>de jure</hi> before, King of
  Kings, and Lord of Lords, makes the Divines so dote as to Interpret that place
  Isa. 49. 23. of <hi>Kings</hi> being <hi>nursing fathers, and Queens nursing

  Church officers Supremely under him to rule in it; when as, were they not
  alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy blind themselves, they could not but see it to be contrary unto truth,
  for women may be Magistrates, but not Church Ministers, and may be Supreme in
  authority in a State, as Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but
  are bid to be under obedience, and fordid in Church matters so much as to
  speak, much more to usurp authority in the Church, 1 Tim. 2. 11. 12. 1 Cor. 14.
  34. 35.</note> so that if any matter of Division of inheritances, or of wrong
and wicked lewdnesse be brought before the Magistrates, committed whether by a
church-member or any other it is all one, reason wills that the Magistrate
should hear it, and (be they Heathens or be they Christians who stand before
him) determine and destribute ac cording to the equity of his civil Law, and as
much as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> looks askew at this assertion p. 120. as if he
thought the Magistrate were to do a Pagan no right against a Christian, without
partiality, not favouring a Christian in a civil cause against a
<hi>Heathen,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi> an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> a <hi>Pagan,</hi> so
as to take the Christians part, further then the equity of his cause in hand
may justly call for it, more then the others, though the Magistrate himself
also be a christian, and a <pb n="536" facs="tcp:42067:273"/> brother to the christian,
whose cause depends before him, or a member of the self same congregation with
him, not balking to do civil justice against Church-members, they deserving
punishment, as if the church were exempted from his 
<note place="margin">viz. in refusing to be judge, in matters of
  faith and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> jurisdiction in civil things, because he is no
christian, but a heathen, nor yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying to do right to church-members, if
they be injured by others, for if he do any of this, I am sure he does no
justice in his place, whereupon <hi>Gallio,</hi> the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Governour of
<hi>Achaia,</hi> who was not a little to be commended in one thing? was no
lesse to blame in another, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 17. in that when the
<hi>Greeks</hi> in a rude and barbarous manner took <hi>Sostenes</hi> the chief
Ruler of the Synagogue, and beat him, for letting <hi>Paul</hi> preach in it,
before his face, and before the very judgement Seat too, yet he cared for none
of those things, for those were the things that fell duly and directly under
his cognizance, as he was a magistrate, and so the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of God to men for
good, whether they be <hi>Christs</hi> disciples or no, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse of
such civil abuses; neither is <hi>Christ</hi> yet in his own person,
<hi>Luke</hi> 12. 13. 14. nay nor yet by any Church-officers of his <hi>(qua

they must do that right that concerns them as such, as meer church-officers to
be judge in those outward cases, and as therein the outward man onely is
concerned, for then <hi>Paul,</hi> one of the chief Apostles, and officers of
the <hi>Church,</hi> being then present, might have taken upon him in the
behalf of <hi>Sostenes,</hi> and himself, as the Pope and the
<hi>PPPriesthood</hi> do for the most part in their religions, to have
determined for themselves in that civill dissention, but <hi>Christ</hi> as

believe by any law, as from the Magistrate, whose duty it is not to force men
to unity of faith and uniformity in Religion, further then they find free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to fall into such unity among themselves; but to force men to live at unity and
peace, in honesty and innocency, in all justice and civility one towards
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under what diversity of religion soever may be among them: and
whilest any Religion puts its people in mind to be subject to principalities
and powers, to obey Magistrates, in civil things for conscience sake, and not
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist them in rebellious waies in such cases, under pain of resisting the
ordinance of God, and receiving to themselves damnation according to <hi>Rom.

protection from them, as it yields subjection to them: for this is the good
will of God concerning them, as such, and whether they be Heathens or
Christians, they are Gods Ministers to attend continually upon this very thing,
<hi>viz.</hi> to render unto all men their dues, as men <hi>viz.</hi> a room in
quiet in the world of what wayes of religion soever, yea though Indians, and
redress of any civil wrongs, as they expect to have all men, of what religions
soever within their power, to render to them their dues of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, honour,

Magistrates are Gods Ministers to the world ward, and to the Church as part of
the world, and in no other sense then as to the rest of the world, to attend
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually on this very thing: to dispense praise or punishments for
<hi>civil</hi> good and evil among men, not spiritual, for then they may punish
evill thoughts, proud looks, ignorance, <hi>non-profiting by the word,</hi> not
Gods Church-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to dispense good or evil, for good or evil done in the
Church, but as the same actions may have reference to the state also, as theft,
or the like civil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, <pb n="540" facs="tcp:42067:275"/> which comes one way under the
Churches censure, and another way under the Common-wealths: they are not I say
Church Ministers, nor Ministers to the Church <hi>qua</hi> Church, as the
Priests principle seemes to make them, for then they may claim not only
Tribute, but Tith also as well as the Priest, but that he will be loath to part
with, though in truth it belongs to him for his Church wasting work full as
little as to the other.</p>
            <p>I humbly beg therefore (I say) of the <hi>Powers,</hi> that truth
which hath been trod under foot may be tolerated among them in their several
civil States, Common-wealths and Kingdomes, and to the end it may undoubtedly
be so, let all that which the <hi>Powers</hi> in the several Nations do judge
in their own consciences to be truth in point of Religion, have toleration and
protection and no more counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by them, as <hi>Magistrates,</hi> but bare
protection from injury, as other waies also may have, and not such
extraordinary supports from a power <hi>Heterogeneal</hi> to that of the
Church, nor such extraordinary gratulations, gratuities, revenews, incomes,
preferments, and portions out of the common <hi>State-stock</hi> (let their own
private purses be as open to them, &amp; such as professe it pay to its
Ministry as much as they will) for besides the partiality of this thing of
making other Religions, and wayes that judge themselves to be the truth as well
as that, pay and be tributaries to the true one, and the grumbles it will
ingender in mens minds, this proves the greatest mischief under heaven to the
truth, when the <hi>Ministers,</hi> who should expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but shame, and

this way or that, and so the Power shall be out of all danger and hazard of
coming under the guilt of <hi>truth treading,</hi> which the <hi>P P
Priesthood</hi> hath engaged the civil power in for 1260 years together, as
else it cannot, for if toleration be of no way but one, then if that chance to

gives <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. that in the world i. e. the civil States and
Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths of it the Tares should stand together among the wheat untill the
harvest, which alone is an Argument putting all out of doubt in this
controversie, he gives this good reason <hi>viz.</hi> least in plucking up the
Tares, the wheat also chance to be rooted up with them, tis for the wheats good
therefore for the Tares to stand, and for the wheats sake that Christ wills
they should, though not in the Church yet in the world to the very end

            <p>And because the <hi>Divine</hi> cannot yet divine that to be
Christs meaning in that scripture, that <hi>false worshippers hereticks</hi>
&amp;c. may lawfully (if not civil offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) be licenced to live in civil
States, let us consider how sinister his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures are upon it, I have
met with some and some of chiefest note in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> who have shifted it of thus,
saying that by the <hi>Field</hi> is meant the <hi>Church,</hi> not the
<hi>World</hi> as we say, and Christ himself interprets it in that place.
Secondly, that the servants, who ask whether they should pluck up the
<hi>Tarts</hi> yea or no, and are bid to let them grow together with the
<hi>Wheat,</hi> are not the <hi>Civil Magistrates,</hi> but Christs Disciples,
who had nothing to doe to pluck them up, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o the <hi>civil Magistrate</hi>
may do it no withstanding: to this purpose I have been answered when I have
askt in way of querie the sense of that place. To which I say,</p>
            <p>First, that by the <hi>Field</hi> is most necessarily meant the
<hi>World,</hi> and not the <hi>Church.</hi> First Christ so expounds it
himself, <hi>the field</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the World:</hi> but, say they,
the <hi>World</hi> is oft used to expresse the Church, and so may here. I
reply, first, I deny that the word <hi>world</hi> in any one place of Scripture
signifies the Church onely; it signifies sometimes the fabrick of the Universe.
Secondly, it signifies all man kind good and bad collectively. Thirdly,
sometimes the wicked onely that lie in wickednesse, 1 <hi>Iohn 1. 13. Iohn</hi>
17. abstract and in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to the godly, and the Church, but never
at all the Church, the godly, the Elect alone abstract, and as in
contradistinction to the wicked: and though I know how far forth to maintain
their absurd doctrines in other cases some <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> divine such a
matter, yet till they shew more for it then they have ever shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, or I
am sure can shew out of the word (not denying but that there is a number
<hi>electorum (i. e.)</hi> all that believe and obey Christ, <hi>exmundo
electus)</hi> their <hi>Mundus electorum</hi> is <hi>haud mundus
dialectus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, here it cannot be the Church however, because it is
<hi>vox secundae intentionis,</hi> a speech that is expounded by Christ to be
the sense of the other speech of <hi>fie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> he used before, for if the word <hi>world</hi> were ever
used for the <hi>Church,</hi> it must be by a figure <hi>synechdoche,</hi>
whereby a smal snip of it is signified by the whole, and then Christ speaks
figuratively again in his Exposition of the other figurative word
<hi>field,</hi> which were <hi>incertum per incertum,</hi> to open one
<hi>paraboricall</hi> ex pression by another as <hi>paraboricall</hi> as that,
which who can think Christ did to his Disciples, to whom his intent was to
speak more plain, that they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand him, but understand him they
could not well, if while he spake figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively at first, he did not speak
properly at last however; for whereas he had told them the <hi>field</hi> was
the <hi>World,</hi> they had as much need to have asked again what the
<hi>world</hi> was, if they could not think he meant plainly as he said.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Church is exprest usually by the name of Christ's
<hi>Garden, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard</hi> 
               <pb n="542" facs="tcp:42067:276"/> &amp;c. which are places more
peculiar, and sequestred as <hi>Cant. 4. 12. 16. Isaiah 5. 6. Ez.</hi> 15. and
the <hi>world</hi> or part without, the <hi>Church,</hi> by the name of
<hi>Field, Forrest</hi> &amp;c. wherein <hi>Tares,</hi> wild bores, briars,
thornes, as well as <hi>wheat,</hi> and Saints may live.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if by <hi>Field</hi> and <hi>World</hi> here is meant
the <hi>Church,</hi> then twill follow, that sith the <hi>Tares, i. e.</hi>
false <hi>Worshippers, Hereticks, Antichristians</hi> are bid to be let alone
untill the harvest, that such as these may be tolerated, not in the world or
<hi>civil state</hi> onely with the <hi>Church,</hi> but also in the very
Church it self, which toleration cannot be, for God chides that Church that
suffers <hi>Iezebel</hi> to teach fornication in her; and if the <hi>P P
Priesthood</hi> plead for such a Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this (as he had need
considering how his Church is filled with tares more then he is either able, or
willing to root out) then he is for a tolleration far more intollerable then
that we plead for; for we would have <hi>Hereticks</hi> and
<hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and <hi>Erroneous false worshippers,</hi> and
<hi>nominall Christians, Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> no neerer the <hi>Church</hi>
then in the world with them, i. e. the same States, Towns, houses, but not in
one and the same <hi>Church-fellowship,</hi> or Congregation, but they would
have them stand in the <hi>Church,</hi> for which sure Christ gives no
<hi>permission,</hi> much lesse a strick <hi>Commission,</hi> as here is, that
they should.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But say you Christ does not here mean that they shall stand,
as if none had to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Abj.</note> 
               <hi>do pluck them up, but onely

            </p>
            <p>Some who are those I trow? it must be then either the
<hi>Ministry,</hi> or the 
<note place="margin">Ans.</note> 
               <hi>Magistracy:</hi> not the
<hi>Ministry,</hi> for it is far more cleer, that by the servants here, that
took notice of the tares to the housholder, is meant the servants of Christ in
the office of <hi>Ministers,</hi> that would fain have been meddling (as the
false Ministry ever does) to root

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all both out of
<hi>Church,</hi> and world too, that is not of institution by Christ in their
opinion, and such a spirit may too much shew it self in the true too, see the
like Spirit in his own disciples the first <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters Luke 9. 54. 55.
Mat.</hi> 15. 12. 13 14. for which Christ gives them a check, and tells them
they knew no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> what spirit they
were of, and bids them let the false plants alone to the heavenly Father to
pluck up in his time, saying <hi>let them alone they be blind leaders of the
blind,</hi> and <hi>will both</hi> in due time <hi>fall into the ditch:</hi>
tis far more clear I say that tis his <hi>Ministry</hi> he here forbids, then
common disciples, for why should not their <hi>Ministry</hi> complain of them
as well as they? yet he bids these let them alone, which shewes too that tis
the <hi>World,</hi> and not the <hi>Church</hi> they are to stand in, for it
belongs properly enough, and primarily to the <hi>Ministers,</hi> with consent
of the Church, executively to passe the censure of putting them out of the
Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly not the Magistracy, for if it were the <hi>Church</hi> as
they say it is, how miserably do they mope (and yet so the Priest does) that
make him the highest officer in the Church to cast persons out of the Church,
who is (though the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est officer over the <hi>Church,</hi> and
<hi>World</hi> too, yet in truth) no <hi>Church</hi> officer, or
<hi>Minister</hi> in the Chuch <hi>(qua</hi> Church) at all.</p>
            <p>Besides lastly, which puts all out of doubt, the prohibition is to
all men as well as some, and sounds forth the mind of Christ to be, that the
tares shall stand in the <hi>Field</hi> till the harvest, and not be pluckt up
by any at all, but stand till the harvest they cannot according to his will, if
according to his will either <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi> or <hi>Minister</hi> might
pluck them up, out of the field, what field ere tis that is here spoken of: his
will is not only that such shall not pluck them up, but that they shall not be
pluckt up until the <hi>harvest,</hi> i. e. the end of the world, till he sends
his <hi>Angels</hi> to gather the <hi>tares,</hi> all things that offend, every
plant, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly father hath not planted, out of his Kingdome, which
taken at large is the whole world, and to bundle them for the fire. To all
these many more reasons may <pb n="543" facs="tcp:42067:276"/> be added why the Magistrate
may not force men at all in matters of <hi>faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Religion,</hi>
worship, see <hi>Barbers</hi> answer to the <hi>Essex watchmens
watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word,</hi> p. 7 &amp;c. the <hi>Magistrate</hi> receives no charge from
God about Religion, neither is <hi>cura animarum,</hi> but <hi>cura
corporum</hi> onely committed to him. <hi>Luther</hi> himself was of this mind,
that the Lawes of the <hi>Magistrate</hi> extended no further then to the
bodies and goods, that which is external, and that God would have none to rule
in the soul, but himself, therefore where the <hi>Magistrate</hi> goes about to
govern in the conscience, he usurps that jurisdiction, which God reserves to
himself, certainly this is that great arrogany in the <hi>Whore</hi> or
<hi>Woman</hi> of sin, which God will severely punish, in that <hi>SSShee</hi>
gives lawes to the conscience, and sits in the Temple and Church of God as a
God.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> in Parliament 1609 said, That <hi>it is a sure
rule in Divinity, that God never loves to plant his Church with violence and
blood,</hi> and again in his <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Papists</hi> that took the said oath, <hi>That he gave a good proof of it
that he never intended persecution for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, but onely desired to be
secured of them for civil abuses, that it was usually the condition of
Christians to be persecuted, but not to persecute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Faith and repentance to acknowledgement of the truth is
Gods gift (and if wee'l believe our Clergy) no way in every mans power, no not
by gift from God to perform, and so the Magistrate must punish m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Again Blasphemers, Persecutors, as <hi>Paul,</hi> Idolators, as
the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> yea <hi>Iewes, Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> may be

Earth, for then they can never possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
            <p>Again persecution was never taught by Christ nor practised by his

  decreed that all <hi>Hereticks</hi> and so many as should in any point resist
  the <hi>Catholique</hi> faith should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that the secular power of
  what degree soever should be compelled openly to swear for the defence of the
  Catholique faith, and to the utmost of their power to root out and destroy in
  their kingdomes, all such persons as the Catholique Church should condemn for
  <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and if any King should be a <hi>Heretick,</hi> or defender
  of them, and not reform within a year, then his subjects should be absolved by
  the Pope from yielding any further subjection or obedience to him, or keeping
  any fidelity with him, and so twas in the case of <hi>John</hi> here in
  England, who resigned to the <hi>Popes Legate</hi> his Crown, kissing his knee
  as he came into <hi>England</hi> (which <hi>John</hi> was after poisoned by a

  of it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Yet theres one way more, whereby they evade all this, and that is
by denying that by the <hi>Tares</hi> here are meant <hi>Hereticks, False
Worshippers,</hi> and <hi>Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and asserting them to be
<hi>Hypocrites</hi> in the Church; and this is the way of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>
(whereby you may see again how Divines are divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in all
things almost, as well as some) which Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> in a book, which

               </gap> (as I remember) that by
<hi>tares</hi> is meant <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> in the Church, who are so like the
<hi>wheat,</hi> that they cannot well be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, nor discetned from it,
and so must be let alone in the Church, by the Ministers of the Church, least
they mistake and pluck up <hi>wheat</hi> instead of <hi>tares,</hi> and cast
out men for <hi>hypocrites,</hi> who its possible may be sincere for ought we
know.</p>
            <p>In answer to which I must confesse men that cast out persons for
<hi>Hypocrites,</hi> had need be pretty wary, and not overhasty, yea better an
inconvenience than a mischief; bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>er erre in letting some <hi>Hypocrites</hi> stand in the Church,
then for hast cast out one that seemes to be so to us, and yet is not.</p>
            <p>But this is not the sense of our Saviour in this place, for as it
cannot be the Church that the <hi>Tares</hi> are here bid to be let alone in
(as I have shewed above) so much lesse by the tares can be meant
<hi>hypocrites,</hi> so neer the <hi>wheat,</hi> i. e. true Saints in shew, and
likenesse, and pretence, as to be hardly disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>First, Though <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are like Saints, and appear so
to be oft, it may be alwaies, to the deceiving of us, yet the Tares are not at
all like the <hi>wheat,</hi> nor at all to any, but such as are stark blind,
appearing to be wheat.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> in the Church (who is one that
app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ars to be what he is not) must
be supposed while he is in the Church, to be discovered, or not discovered so
to be, when not discovered, he is no hypocrite to us, to whom things are, as
they appear (what ere he may be to God) but as true a Saint as the rest; and
when discovered (till when to us he is a Saint, and must stand under the notion
of a Saint) then he must not stand in the Church, which is not to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor any
that are palpably wicked, and who is so palpable as he, whose <hi>simulata
sanctit as</hi> is <hi>dulplex iniquitas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now First, the tares he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e spoken of are plainly <hi>said,</hi> and seen to be
<hi>tares,</hi> and appeare to be <hi>tares,</hi> and a distinct stuff from the
<hi>Wheat;</hi> and yet for all that they are bid to be let alone in the
<hi>Field,</hi> as <hi>Hypocrites</hi> must not be in the <hi>Church,</hi> when
they appear to be such.</p>
            <p>But in the field, i. e: the world tis true enough that hypocrites
may stand, even after they are cast out of the Church, unlesse they act any
thing that civil justice will reach them for, and so also may Antichristians,
and all false Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>
            <p>Tis evident then that in this place, as well as <hi>Matth.</hi>

in the same Church, by all means in the same world, or part of the world
<hi>locally</hi> considered, for the Church is not locally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as a
place measured by, and consistent of such or such a compasse of ground, as the
Popes parish Churches did, whereupon they went on procession once a year, lest
they should forget the bounds of their Church, but mystically, of such or such
a company of men, however scattered <hi>locally</hi> here or there, yet in one
fellowship, I say in the same part of the world, nation, City, Countrey, civill
corporation, with the <hi>wheat, Saints, true Church,</hi> under the protective
power of civil Magistracy free from molestation, meerly for their religion, so
be they live justly, soberly and peacably with all men, any thing said to the
contrary in any wise notwithstanding by the Priest, who of all men hath least
reason to be against toleration of tares in the world, and of plants which the
heavenly father never planted; if he consider what he is himself, and unlesse
he desire to be <pb n="545" facs="tcp:42067:277"/> rooted out in hast by the civill power,

<hi>viz.</hi> that they refrain from meddling more with men, though they seem
mad men to the world, and besides themselves for the sake of truth in pretence,
left happily they be found fighters against God, for if any way be not of God,
twill in Gods time come to nought of it self, and ye cannot establish it, if of
God you cannot withstand it, but twill come on, in this juncture specially,
wherein it dawns toward the great day, and God is about to pluck up every plant
he hath not planted; And if men be in your apprehension blind leaders of the
blind in things of God, yet let them alone, if they will not go to the right
way when called to it, they will see, when they both fall into the ditch. And
likewise I humbly beg that what is further and more clearly held forth
concerning this subject of liberty of conscience by Mr. <hi>Blackwood,</hi> in
the first part of his storming of Antichrist, may be well weighed by our
Magistrates, together with the thirty quaeries presented to them lately by Mr.
<hi>Iohn Goodwin,</hi> and his vindication of them against the
<hi>Apologist,</hi> neither of which ever will be answered solidly by their
parish Ministers.</p>
            <p>And as for the PPPriesthood it self (though I hope the night is
too farre spent for any (save such as will be ignorant, and if any man will be
ignorant, let him be ignorant saith <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 28. and so say I)
to doubt but that the day is dark over them and theirs) they are blind leaders

be as <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> and <hi>Schismatical</hi> from the truth, as they

from such searches as have been made by their Surregates Paritors and Proctours

            <p>I wish well to the persons of the men called CCClergy (God is my

wherein they pray the Powers to beat all men into the belief of all they say by
the sword, the belief of which they can never beat into them by the word, then
let them and their party practise what they please: let their way be no way of
civill violence to all other wayes and then in civil peace let them walk in it
till they are weary: and let it stand till by the word it fall before the true
one, if it be such a noun Adjective that it cannot stand by it self in
Scripture, sense and Reason, without such a Substantive as the civil sword to
support it, tis a sign that theres far more shew, then Substance in it: for
verily that Gospel that will not stand not onely without, but against the edge
of <hi>Caesars</hi> sword encountring with it, is Antichrists, but none of
Christs Gospel to me: yet such it seems is the CCClergies Gospel, which freedom
to set it up by other wayes leaves still as helplesse, as hopelesse, of ever
standing, unlesse it may be stablisht against all other wayes, on the necks of
all people by the carnal weapons of <hi>Caesars</hi> civil State; its very
doubtful of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the feild with no other strength then its own Canons,
unlesse the state lend it her ordinances to back them but if <hi>Baal</hi> be a
God, me thinks he might speak <pb n="549" facs="tcp:42067:279"/> for himself against them
that throw down his Altars, without imploring all the Gods of the earth to
speak for him; if the Multitude of his Priests cannot set up his worship,
without the Magnitude of earthly Princes to relieve them, let it go, and a good
riddance of it too, if Dagon 
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam 5. 24</note> cannot stand on his own
legs, but must fall before the Ark, unlesse the benevolence of others lift him
up, his PPPriests may set him up as much as they will for themselves, but they
shall never set him up again for me. Neverthelesse I am as freely willing, sith
tis the will of Christ, and his Testament, that even <hi>Baalitish, Romish</hi>
worshippers should have a Room, and being in the world by the civil Magistrates
permission, they yielding civil sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection 
<note n="*" place="margin">which he hath more saith then I that
  believes they ever will for surely the CCClergies <hi>Win all or lose all</hi>
  will pull them down at last.</note> even to the end thereof, as I am willing
there should be a Room and being in it for the truth, for though the Prophets
of <hi>Baal</hi> were put to death in reforming <hi>Elijahs</hi> time, in the
old Church of Israel, which was the type, yet that pointed out no more then
that spiritual execution, which is to be done on <hi>Iezebel,</hi> and her
false worships in the true Church in these reforming times of the Gospel, not
one of which may abide any more in the Gospel Israel; yea I here seriously
sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the civil Powers for them, that their consciences no more then ours
may be forced by any forinsecal power to act in Church worships contrary to
their conviction, but if nought will content the <hi>PPPriesthood</hi> at all
(as of old it would not) but that all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as they call them,
that hearken not to their <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> must be clublawd into
conformity to their parochial precepts, so far at least as to obey the
<hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry</hi> of their purses, without free leave from their
own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences so to do, then (protesting against the iniquity of their
desires after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of those, who desire the protection of them from
persecution by the civill Power) my most humble suit to the supreme Powers is,
that they will be pleased, as to let the <hi>PPPriesthood</hi> preach as much
as they please (a little of which work serves the turns of some of them) and to
let such as are satisfied in their Souls and spirits, that they ought to do
both, to own and pay them, so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to let such as seem to themselves on
sufficient grounds to have clear cause to decline them, have the freedome of
their consciences to be none of their flocks, and being none of their flocks, a
freedom from being forcibly fleec'd by them any more; and if the CCClergy shall
he Angry at this without a cause, to let them be pleased without amends, sith
tis most evident, that as men ought not to be constrained against their wills,
to be of Christs, much lesse of the <hi>CCClergies</hi> flock, so he that
feedeth a flock may freely, and not by force, live of the milk of that flock he
feeds, and may not of them that are forrainers to his flock, further then they
are free to supply him: they went forth freely to preach the Gospel for his
names sake, taking nothing, much lesse by force, of the Gentiles, that were
Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to the Church of old, <hi>Iohn Ep.</hi> 3. v. 7. and many heathenish
Parishes here have the Gospell preacht freely to them when they accept on it by
the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, that go forth of the true churches at this day, but many
Parish Ministers will make all that live, or have to do within their line, buy
their Sermons of them, and that at their own price too, whether they like them
or no, and, which is worse, though they have sold them once, it may be often,
ore already (and a dear penniworth too) yet as oft as they remove to other
livings, they carry them away along with them in their papers from the people,
that have already bought and paid for them, preach them ore again, and so sell
them for as much more in other places: but I hope the civil power throughout
<hi>Europe,</hi> as well as they do in the tenth part of it already, will take
cognizance ere long, that it can be no great ease to truly tender consciences,
who with the <hi>CCClergy</hi> are ever stiled <hi>Sectaries</hi> and
<hi>Schismaticks,</hi> to lie under the lash of these Lords over Gods heritage,
and in tender consideration thereof, and compassion to those righteous souls,
who are vexed with their vanities, proclaim such a <hi>Iubilee</hi> that the
true spouse of <hi>Christ,</hi> whom they made a keeper of their vineyard,
shall have leave to keep her own vine yard, &amp; go forth from her
Apprenticeship to these spiritual Task-masters, that their 
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:42067:280"/> consciences shall be no more yoaked, nor captivated to
their crude and carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and the wings of the <hi>CCClergy</hi> so
clipt, that they shall not soare so high, as they have done, over the faith of
all people; yea in the name of the blessed, and onely <hi>Potentate King</hi>
of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords, Christ Iesus,</hi> I warn
all the civil <hi>Powers, Princes</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> of the world,
that have been bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the sorceries of that WWWhore, who corrupts the
earth with her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they give up their power and strength no
more to be improved to the forcing of the inhabiters of the earth, to drink of
the golden cup, and wine of her fornications, but that they improve it rather
henceforth to the freeing all men from from her conscience crushing principle
of per secution by the civil sword, that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not to her <hi>Sinodical</hi>

and permit not all people to live peaceably in their several forms of worship,
they behaving themselves civilly, and in all subjection to them in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

through these, and that too since they Apostatized from the truth? shall we
think that all Christs ministers descend lineally from the loines of

Christ hath set in his Church, to redresse all thats amisse in it: such a

of any authority at all since the last new modelling of it, so discontented
were you that your <hi>Northern model</hi> was in no more request: yea though
you held it such a lawful, and sufficient power, when they made an ordinance
for Tith and Trebble dammages, that you held your selves bound in conscience to
God, or rather your own good, to obey it, and improved you selves to the utmost
to see it executed on conscientious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents against it, yet when
ordinances for double service came, as solemn fasts (witnesse that of
<hi>Iun.</hi> 13. 1652.) so strictly enjoined to be observed by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of every parish, how many of you drew your necks out of the coller, as not
owning the then Parliament to be a power, that you might lawfully submit to:
thus an ordinance that is charged topful of <hi>benefice</hi> you durst venture
to let off, but when one came that had nothing but bare <hi>office</hi> in the
mouth of it, then they, by whose orders you pretended to stand in both
<hi>benefice</hi> and <hi>office,</hi> might give order to

it.</p>
            <p>And as your meer Mongrell <hi>Caesarean; Magistratical,
Pope-episcopall</hi> kind of Ordination, together with that unworthy <hi>un
Pastorlike</hi> forcible Obtrusion of your selves as Pastors on people without
their free election; so your <hi>Popelike</hi> practises and unministerly
management of your selves in all other particulars, doth proclaim you plainly
to be no true Ministers of Christs Gospel, nor true Pastors of the flock, but
rather to be Wolves, Theeves, Robbers, Hirelings that come not in by the dore
Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, but climb into the folds some otherwaies, to wit the
recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great men and sometimes buying the gift of the spirit i. e.
a spiritual living, yet modestly saying No thrice as the Bishops when they had
given a thousand pound for the place, and improvement of your interest in your
Patrons, and do come into spoil, steal, destroy and serve your own selves of
them as well as you can, while you are with them, and so away again to make a
prey of some other parishes, for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily if you can spie out any flocks that
have better fleeces then other (leaving those you lived with before to shift
for themselves) without their leave, &amp; with the leave of such as pretend to
the power of presentment, youl be their <hi>Pastors</hi> whether they will or
no: but if any of you be chosen for their churchmen by a poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that want

            <p>Yea what maintenance is in this or that vacant parish, which you
are harping after, is one of the main Questions thats about it: yea Ye minister
for maintenance, ye teach for reward, ye preach for hire, ye divine for money,
ye turn the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel into a meer trade, to the learning of which you put men
out as Apprentices about some seven years to the universities, and then allow
them (as free men ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) to set up for themselves and get as good livings by
it as they can: where you may be sure of sufficient wages, you will tell men a
little of the truth, and truely tis not much of it that you know, but you care
not how little you preach of that little you have to preach, where you can hope
to have but little pay for your pains.</p>
            <p>Wo to yee O ye National PPPriesthood, tis too too eviden that you
are not the Shepheards of the sheep, yea you are the idol-shepheards, that
leave the flock to provide for your selves, not regarding their welfare, when
by slincking away from them you can provide but a little better for your own:
you are <hi>(except is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiendis)</hi> saving some few hundreds among many
thousands, Hirelings' that flee to prefer, better, secure, advance, or
advantage your selves, because you are Hirelings, and care not for the sheep:
you are Pastore that are become bruitish, you have not sought the Lord, but
your selves for the most part, therefore shall ye not prosper, but your sheep
shall be scattered away from you <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. yea verily you drive them
from you dayly more and more, not onely by many pieces of your dry divinity but
specially with your terrible doctrine of trebble damages, in which you drive so
furiouslly upon them, that you drive them both out of your dores, and their own
also: you have an evill eye of covetuousnesse, and greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse upon the tenth
of every mans substance, and therefore you loose no time, while the law of man
favours you in it, though not the man Christ Jesus, and spare no pains, but
take, scrape, strive, streign, ride, run, rake, wrangle, weary out your selves
and neighbours, and all Courts and Committees, in City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to have
something out of every thing, for doing worse then nothing, till you not onely
trebbly endamage, but totally undo many poor mens wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bodies,
and your own souls too (except ye repent, little considering that an

you passe over judgement, mercy, faith, and the weighty matters of Christs
law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you eat the fat, and cloth your selves with the wool, and kill them
that are fed, but you feed not the flock; you even flea the very flesh from
mens bones, for your un-dues, and that such men too sometimes, whom your selves
are, so far from teaching, that you have need to learn of them, which be the
first principles of the oracles of God: you feed your people with words, but
not with the word: you strengthen not the diseased, but strengthen them in
their diseases; you strengthen the hands of the wicked, that they do not return
from their wickednesse, and discourage the hearts of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: you run
from place to place, parish to parish, parsonage to parsonage, pretending you
have Christs call from this to that, when the loadstone that leads you is the
love of lucre: and when you are about to leave one living for the love of
another, you often dance a while between both, serving them by turns, by the
halves, till the half year be expired, that you may have your half years hire
from both places, and when you take your leave of the flock, which you fleec't
before, then what a deal of do there is to part, and such scrape sometimes, as
if it went to the hearts of you, that you must forsake them; then there is
farewell speeches, farewell Sermons, farewell all at once, once for all, the
Lord be with you, and such like; but the devil may take them all, and be their
minister if he will for you, if you can but get Christs call to a bigger
living, or some more emolumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall employment:</p>
            <p>And howbeit, you parish PPPastors can give your selves a
dispensation from Christ to run away (for selfs sake) when you please from your
flocks, yet if any of your flocks run away from you (for Christs sake) to other
Pastors, many of you take o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

heavily at this, saying tis a most miserable thing, that when you have
converted them, and been a means of opening their eyes 
<note n="*" place="margin">If you were not blind your selves, you
  would gather thus much from that, viz. that while men are blind they sat under
  your ministry, but when once they begin clearly to see, they can see no ground
  to sit under you any longer.</note>, they should presently run away from your
ministry: you may separate your selves it seems without sin from them, for more
Tith, but if they separate themselves from you for more Truth, this is such a
high piece of Schism, and iniquity in the Church, as deserves to be sharpely
censured by the State, at least if they abide not in all conformity to the cry
of your wide mouthd coffers? which if they do theres so much the more content:
yea let them run to what Pastors they will, so they still stand Paymasters to
you, for what said one even what many more of you proclaim is in your minds, by
your mindlesseness of ministring to men in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, any farther then
they minister to you in carnal <hi>viz</hi> let them run to the devil if they
will quoth he) (for so you judge they do when they run from you to God) so they
will but pay us our tithes. How justly may even <hi>England</hi> say as
<hi>Isaiah</hi> said <hi>of Israel of old Isa. 56. 10. 11. 12. his watchmen are
all blind, they are dumb dogs that cannot bark,</hi> (but bite they can
bitterly if men put no into their mouthes) <hi>sleeping, lying down, loving to
slumber, greedy dogs that never have enough, all looking to their own way;
every one to his gain from his quarter:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as you can shift and flee from flock to flock, and stand in
several livings one after another, &amp; some of you in two or three togetherin
the same creeds, catechisms, formes of worship, Government &amp;c. for your own
earthly ends, and emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so can you stand under severall postures,
practises, creeds, catechisms, forms of worship, government in the same livings
rather then lose them, when time and tide turns so strongly upon you, as to
turn you out of your places, if you turn not with it.</p>
            <p>Yea verily you are the most subtle, shifting, sinful, shameful,
shuffling, self Saviours (some few still excepted, for those that know their
innocency in this, I speak not of them, but if any mens consciences tell them,
I speak of them, I speak of them indeed) from suffering joyfully the spoiling
of your goods, turning out of your houses, in the troublous turnes of times,
for your professed consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence scruples, that are to be found throughout the
earth: hence it is that you are generally quiet under the absence of that which
you strictly pleaded for as truth, <pb n="562" facs="tcp:42067:286"/> while it stood, and
under the establishment of that which you stiled, and stickled against as
error, till it was set up, when the remove was made by the hand of that
authority, that was like to remove you out of your places if you sided not with
it: you suspend the removal of known corruptions, and practise of known truths
many times, unlesse the whole state will move all in a body with you, and
unlesse all men may be made to march your way by Canons, Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Acts,
yea one order for this or that from the Rulers hath often given you a more
clear sight of some things you seemd not to see before in an hour, then bare
reason would have done in a year: from your Masters to you, as well as to your
ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from you <hi>stat pro ratione voluntas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that the same persons could ever serve the nations in
the office of Priesthood under powers never so different, never so
contradictory one to other in principles, postures, practises, government,
discipline, liturgies, formes, Creeds, Catechisms, when there was no other
remedy, though till the sword decided it there was nothing, but deadly
implacability, irreconcileablenesse to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers waies, maugre all that the
word could do among you: witnesse the case of Common prayer, which many of you
saw to be a corruption, yet kept to it while twas dangerous to decline it, and
till Authority took it away; what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority had to do to take it away by force
from them, whose conscience, being blinded, perswaded them they ought to use
it, I leave to authority to examine, yet sure I am that Authority hath no
Authority from God, if it be a corruption, to excuse, impower or authorize any
one to practise it without sin, for so much as but an hour; and many of you,
that could not see it to be any corruption at all, but rather such a thing as
would pluck up all Religion by the rootes, till such time as Authority did

would say otherwise then you all said) saying and unsaying, seeing and
unseeing, turning and returning changing and unchanging. singing a new song,
and unsinging it again, agreeing to speak with one mouth like the Prophets that
Prophecyed before <hi>Ahab 1 Kin.</hi> 22. 13. who all, save one

to please the King: so that whereas of old it was throughout all

overwiv'd by <hi>Iezebell</hi> that stole the breeches from him while he lay in

Powers in these parts are resolved to be suprem, and to be no more such

            <p>We cannot but be aware, unlesse we will wink, how the body of you

<hi>Henry Papists,</hi> under K. <hi>Edward Protestants,</hi> under Q. <hi>Mary
Papists,</hi> under Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and K. <hi>Iames Protestants,</hi>
and though you were ever eager for that form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Worship still
that was in present being, pleading the truth of it, as if you would have lost
your lives rather then left it, crying out that Religion it self was taken away
if that were not continued, as of old for Masse, and Popes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and more
lately for Common prayer and Episcopacy, and more lately yet for a <hi>Synodian

when you judge it may cost you a whipping, if you grumble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not.</p>
            <p>Thus whilest truly tender spirits like a few harmlesse flies are

may as well (for ought I know) begin again with the Baptists in the principles
or <hi>A B C</hi> of Christs doctrine <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. and primitive

            <p>You professe (you Protestant Priests) to be Reformers in these
times, and places, and bringers back of Gods people from <hi>Babylon</hi> to
<hi>Sion,</hi> but verily you hold them back from Returning so fast, and so far
homeward to the truth, as some do, &amp; more would do, were it not for you,
who rather rap them in, then help them on that run faster, then your coveteotis
turns can afford them to do in this work of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bythe word, yea you are
the greatest hinderers and retarders that are, of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reformation of
all things according to the plain pattern of the word, which yet upon several
occasions since <hi>Protestanism</hi> came up you have protested for your
selves, and also pressed, not to say (what in you lies) forced, all people to
protest for with you.</p>
            <p>How is it else that men, when they passe but a little from you
Watchmen, find him who their souls love, and being first a shamed of your, and
their abominations, while by implicit faith they dwelt under the shadow of your
Ministery, see the form, and fashion, the commings in and goings out, and even
all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and the lawes of Christs house, and keep and do them in
some measure, and not tarrying for man, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. 7. nor waiting for the
Sons of men, are, if not fully reformed, yet daily reforming according to their
covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> the word of God and example of the best reformed
Churches, <hi>viz. Iudaea, Rome</hi> in her first and true glory, <hi>Corinth,
Galatia, Ephesus, Plilippi, Colosse, Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet you, even you <hi>Watchmen</hi> are blind, and found beating;
and abusing the spouse, for her inquiries, and sit like a company of <hi>Black
Ravens</hi> or <hi>Rooks</hi> in a mist, gaping after what way the whole body
will take their flight, before any Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, though never so clear in

you wait one upon another <hi>Sperantes omnes in singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, singuli in

            <p>You groap for the way like the blind, like them that have no eyes,

they are men, and not God, flesh, and not spirit, there comes no help at all,
save help to Gods people against you, and such help too, that he that helpeth
you shall fall, and you that are holpen shall fall down, and you shall all fall
together and none deliver. You are sworn as well as we in the sight of both God
and men to reform according to the word, and that word is nigh enough, even in
your mother tongue, bibles, hearts and mouths, <hi>viz.</hi> the word of faith
which we preach:</p>
            <p>Neither is it far off you unless your shutting your eyes against
it, and putting it away from you, hath engaged the Lord to shut up your eyes,
and put it f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

because seeing you would not see, thereupon seeing you shall not: You have also
promise enough from Christ to know his will in his word if you look to him
onely and to it:</p>
            <p>Yet you say, who shall go up to heaven to bring Christ down to us
again? who shall descend into the deep tobringChrist to us from the dead? who
shall go beyond the Sea for us, <hi>viz. Holland, Germany, &amp;c.</hi> and
bring the word unto us, that we may hear it and do it? who shall go into
<hi>Scotland</hi> and brings us a directory and platform of government from
them? You swear to reform after the example of the best reformed Churches, but
you mean of <hi>Europe,</hi> not of <hi>Asia</hi> sure, not the congregations
you read of in the word, but the Nations you dote on in the world <hi>viz.
Scotland, Holland, Denmark, Swethland, Germany</hi> &amp;c. which all
<hi>qua</hi> Nations (excepting such in them as truly fear God and worship him
answerably to his will) are together with this, till they be converted to the
faith by the spiritual and the civil sword, and then (not in nonage) baptized
(not sprinkled) in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>he name of
Christ, with confession, and for remission of sins, and then walk in free (not
forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) fellowship in breaking bread and prayers, are as far <hi>in sano
sensu</hi> from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of true Churches, and have as much need of
reforming, as our selves. Indeed you talk of Church, of Orthodoxnes and
reformation, as the thing much desired, making them the Hereticks and
Schismaticks that side not with you: see <hi>Baxt.</hi> p. 151. <hi>We prayed
for reformation, and the progressr of the Gospel, we fasted and mourned, and
cryed to God, we waited and long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

for it more then for any worldly possession; indeed we overvalued it, and had
too sweet thoughts of it, as if it had been our heaven, and rest, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tis just in God to suffer these men</hi> (meaning the Anabaptists) <hi>to
destroy our hopes, and if they root the Gospel quite out of</hi> England
<hi>its just in God, but yet we hope they shall be but our scourges, and that
God is but teaching us the evil of their Schisms &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Sirs, what is that hoped for reformation of yours, the pure
Gospel you Presbyters so much talk of, which those that hinder and hold not
with you in, are all sentenced for Schismaticks <hi>ipso facto:</hi> for my
part I could never find what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation more in ordinances, discipline,
doctrine and government, you <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Priesthood</hi> aimd at, then
establishment of the Scottish faith and the removal of the Bishops, and their
superstitious Clergy as they removed the Popish before out of place, that
themselves might reign as tyrannically in their steads; the pulling down of red
glass windows, and placing of white, the knocking down of Fonts, and setting up
Basons to Rantize in, the forcing the fathers to say the same at the Font, that
the God-fathers did in old time, the observation of your own directory instead
of the old liturgy, giving the supper to none at all (for most riged Presbyters
have denied that to their whole parishes this seven year) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of giving it

               </gap>uously to all, levelling
the maintenance of the Nations ministry, so that every one may have a
competency of an 100d <hi>per annum;</hi> and not some all, some none as in
old'n time, and a few such trivial translations, in which the Gospel is no more
promoted, reformation according to the primitive faith and baptism far lesse
furthered, then it would be, if never a penny might more be paid to the Priests
that preach for hire while the world stands, such a <pb n="565" facs="tcp:42067:287"/>
reformation indeed you have generally overvalued, therefore its justice in God
to you, and mercy to the whole land, to suffer his people to prosper in their
preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the truth to the utter destroying of your hopes, which if they
were not more after worldly possessions in many of you that settled your selves
in 100ds <hi>per annum</hi> by the shift, then after that which is truth
indeed, twill be the better for you another time, but I testifie it to the
faces of you that for all your <hi>prayings,</hi> and <hi>fastings,</hi> and
<hi>mournings,</hi> and <hi>cryings</hi> to God, and <hi>waitings,</hi> and

you bid your people now or then prove all things, that they may find out which

without an answer, so you hast to have an end, not hearing half the half
quarter that is to be said, in opposition to your own opinions about that

mood and figure, is neither suitable to the simplicity and plainess of speech
in which the Gospel ought to be declared, and discussed, nor reasonable to
reason in with <hi>Russet Rabbies,</hi> that are otherwise reasonable enough to
give you such reasons of their faith and practise, as you can never rationally

your feet, putting on as fair pretences as may be, of willingnesse to try, and
have all things seen as they are, upon the forepart of your work, and then
dashing all out with your tail, and blurring all ore again with with some after

in the spirits of the people.</p>
            <p>As your Fathers have done before you for ages and generations
together, so do your selves in this point, &amp; more too not a few, Their
delight was to hide their counsels, and to do their works in the dark, that
they might say who seeth and who knoweth us?</p>
            <p>Yea the whole Creation of you out of the <hi>Chaos</hi> of
<hi>Romes Catholicon,</hi> have been a very race of Smotherers, that have cryed
down truth as <hi>Heresie,</hi> Saints as <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> their
tendernesse as stubbornnesse, their serviceablenesse to Christ as selfishnesse,
seperation from your superstitions, and corrupt communions, as
<hi>Sectarism,</hi> singularity; perseverance in Christs way, without turning
back to the flesh pots of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as obstinacy and will fulnesse,
Church meetings as Conventicles, Church Messengers, who are Christs true
Ministers to the world e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the end of it, approving themselves as so, (as
few of you do) in much pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, in tumults &amp;c. reducing men to primitive
purenes of faith, fellowship, worship, baptism, Supper, life, as Fools,
Bedlams, Juglers, Seducers, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Tumultuous, deservedly round and rough
reprovings of you who, are more then any men hardened in your abominations, as
<hi>Elias, Iohn, Christ</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did them that were like you,
disgracing, tailing, reviling, the one and onely true baptism as
<hi>Anabaptism,</hi> basenesse, Enthusiasm, Scripture searching by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,
the onely way of Christs own appointment for all men to come to acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with him by, as medling more then needs, Scripture opening by the illiterate
Weaver, Taylor, Shoomaker, Souldier, upon whom the spirit, that onely makes a

an unknown tongue, you Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish P Priesthood, who deliver it from that, would
more subtilly smother in a known, whilest how far soever men see into the word,
yet they must see and say nothing, or presume to see no farther, nor practise
any faster than the Priest.</p>
            <p>Yea to shew how little you degenerate from him, you even fill up
the measure of your Father the <hi>Pope,</hi> that wrath may come upon you all
to the utmost, whilst in these last breakings forth of light from all that
smother, wherewith <hi>Synodicall</hi> constitution hath overcast it, even
since your own seperation from <hi>Rome,</hi> you damn it all by whole sale for
darknesse; ye are therefore of your Father <hi>Abad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>n,</hi> and the works of that Father of yours ye do, he
was a Smotherer from his beginning, and neither could abide in, nor can yet
abide the truth, because there is no truth in him, he opened the bottomelesse
pit, and raised up such a smoak of traditions, Ceremonies, Canons, Calumnies,
lyes, nicknames, misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of things to the world, as the smoak of a
great furnace, to the darkning of the sun and the air, when he speaks a ly, he
speaks of his own, for he is a lyar, and next to the devill the Father of it,
when he smothers that which should come to light, he acts most like himself,
for he is a Smotherer also, and the father of that practise.</p>
            <p>Wherefore also as beloved that curse, even darknesse, drynesse,
and smother so it is come unto him and his <hi>CCClergy,</hi> as he delighted
not in the blessing of light, so it is far from him, as he cloathed himself,
and his with smoak, and smother like as with a garment so it is come into his
very bowells, and like oile into his bones, it must be to him as the garment
that covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he must be girded; this is the
Reward of that Adversary from the lord, and of all that speak evil with him
against the truth.</p>
            <p>Thus God hath lese you in his just severity to wander in by waies,
and to be lost in the laborinth of your learned Legands, till you be all moped,

them) settle longer in one place, then till they have more means, or be more to
their minds in another? had this piece been propounded by parish ministers and
people it had become them, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ounding somewhat sutable to their posture and principle, for tis
the usual tone they talk in, when one Pastor having left them, to take up
another call from Christ, or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment somewhere else to his advantage, they
addresse to the Committee for the approbation or settlement of such or such a
godly <hi>Orthodox</hi> Divine among them, as they have agreed with (if they
can get the Committees good will, for till then all parties are not agreed it
seems among either you or them) to be their minister: but to see them, whom I
suppose to be Independents (for I am sure they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent men that
propose the next parcel <hi>viz. Thomas Goodwin, Nye, Simpson</hi> whose
propositions these approve of) to see I say Independents flocks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, it may
be half a year, on Committees to have their Pastors approved on, and settled by
the Committees among them me thinks is something shameful: I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned that the
Independent Churches had reckoned themselves to have had the sole power not
onely of choosing, and presenting, but of approving, settling and ordaining
their own Pastors among themselves (but I see I am deceived) and why may not
the Church onely without the Committee approve of her own ministers, to be
<hi>Orthodox,</hi> and be able to minister in their assemblies and meetings, as
well as to approve of such of her members to be Orthodox, and allow them to
speak <pb n="576" facs="tcp:42067:293"/> as she shall judge fit to speak, for in the next
proposal but one or two, it appears you judge she (without the Committee) may
approve of such.</p>
            <p>And what mean you by your <hi>Pastors leaving you to take up some
other call or imployment?</hi> are your Pastors also such Idol shepheards, as
it may be supposed now and then will leave their flocks for any other
imployment? what imployment may they lawfully leave their flocks for, with whom
they are in fellowship so as to stand Pastors no more among them? is their any
worldly imployment to which the Pastors office must give way so to as to cease
for its sake, when it comes in place? I know but one employment in honour, and
excellency beyond that good work of a Bishop, or overseer among his flock, as
namely that of <hi>Apostleship,</hi> or <hi>Messengership</hi> from the Church,
to convert the world, if it be that you mean, Ile have you excused, in choosing
you other <hi>Pastors</hi> to oversee you in the Lord, in your Messengers
absence from you to preach to the world, but other imployment I know none more
honourable then the <hi>Ministership,</hi> for which its worthy to be left by
them that have food and raiment in it: neither count I it perferment, but
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy for a <hi>Minister</hi> to be removed from his
<hi>Ministership,</hi> and <hi>Servant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> in feeding the sheep of
Christ, over which the holy spirit makes him overseer, though it be to a
<hi>Lordship,</hi> a <hi>Mastership,</hi> a <hi>Presidentship,</hi> a
<hi>Deanship</hi> ore a colledg, whether that Colledge be Christs Church also,
yea or no; specially if that fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ck
he leaves be left so destitute of another <hi>Pastor,</hi> that it must wait
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps 12 moneths for another, and at last, if at long running they cannot
have one, must be fain to flee all to pieces, and dissolve their Chruch and
disperse themselves up and down to other Churches.</p>
            <p>Smite the Shepheard with some better employment, and then all his
sheep that were gathered may be scattered, and separate themselves together
into severall places: I like this but a little, and am confident Christ Jesus
likes it lesse: if you can follow any manual imployment for your livings, as
<hi>Paul</hi> and others did, and preach the Gospel too to make it as much as
may be without charge, I like it well but I am jealous you'l make a trade too
much of the Gospel too.</p>
            <p>You propound that <hi>none presume under a penalty to speak in any
Assemblies, or meetings but ministers of the word, members of Churches
approved, except meetings purposely for disputing, and that where meetings be
kept up likewise, persons speak <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>here that have Commission from some right constituted Church, or
certificate from two or more able, godly, Orthodox ministers, of their
suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to speak, and soundnesse in the faith, except Masters to their
families, Schoolmasters to their Schollars, or others to such, as by their
callings fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their government or charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then at least civil Magistrates may speak any where within their
verge, without certificate of their sufficiency so to do, to the people, that
by reason of their call fall under their Government and charge, but others may
not, though the spirit moves them, unlesse they can obtain a certificate from
some Ministers.</p>
            <p>Sirs, what mean you to muzzle men up in this manner under
penalties, from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening their mouths to speak, unlesse they bring
testimonials, and certificates from men? if any man speak from God, God will
give testimony to him by assisting him to speak honestly at least, though
weakly and plainly; if God do not testifie to any man that speaks, so but that
the hearers judge him insufficient, or that he speaks weakly, and sillily, and
see that God leaves him to utter error, they may leave him too if they please,

            <p>Tis propounded by Mr. <hi>Owen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> Mr. <hi>Sympson, that such as do not receive, but oppose those
principles of Christian Religion, without the acknowledgement whereof the
Scriptures do clearly and plainly affirm that Salvation is to be obtained, may
not be suffered to preach or promulgate any thing in opposition unto such
principles:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this verily I am not satisfied at any hand, for not to
acknowledge Iesus Christ to be the Christ, but to deny him to be the Son of
God, when he is plainly preached is not to receive, but oppose those principles
of Christian Religion, the non-acknowledgement of which, where Christ at least
is made known, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inconsistent with salvation; yet thus did the Iews
when Christ in person was among them, contradicting, blaspheming him, as also
the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did not receive him, yet the civil powers of the world
had no power from Christ to curb them, and not suffer them to say what they
would against Christ sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and solely I say because of that: neither find I
(as before) any warrant in the word for <hi>Caesar</hi> the civil powers of the
world to prohibit, or <hi>sub paen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

several dominions under the Gospel any more then to prohibit the true Christian
Religion it self: All Religions lived under <hi>Caesar</hi> in Christs and the
Apostles dayes, and were not by him persecuted, nor constrained, either to be
of his Religion, nor to say nothing against it, nor against any other: in after
times indeed when the Emperours grew bloody against the Christians, all
Religions li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved quietly under <hi>Caesar,</hi> but the Christian; that was
worse then nought, and I think it not a little too bad, and not doing (as our
duty is) to all men as we desire they should do to us, but the way back to

them, and God delights in no mans legs) but if there were need of that to the

Simony, I do not say that they all buy them with ready mony, but shew me one of

kindred or alliance promoteth, and some the authority of their parents, some by
doing of pleasures do get themselves favour. Finally, benesices are given to
this end, not to provide for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but for them that receive them,
therefore they call them benefices, by which words they do sufficiently
declare, that they make no other account of them, but as the beneficial gifts
of Princes, whereby they either get the favour of their souldiers, or reward
their services, I omit how these rewards are bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Barbers, Cooks,

else but a prey cast afore dogs to hunt after. Is this tolerable even to be
heard of, that they should be called Pastors, which have broken into possession
of a Church as into a farm of their enemie? that have have gotten it by

generation that age, from Apostolical purity, doth proceed from this rotten
root of <hi>covetousnesse,</hi> which hath so corrupted the whole Masse of men
called Ministers, for this 1260. years and upward, that <hi>vel duo vel

fully held forth the truth in all points, as it is in Jesus, from thenceforth

Tim.</hi> 6. 5. and <pb n="597" facs="tcp:42067:303"/> pose liberal and bountiful
maintenance, and rich Revenues to be the chief corner stone in their church
work? yet thus the Clergy by their wonted clamors for it not onely at
<hi>Rome</hi> but at <hi>Westminster</hi> also seem to me to suppose; yea the
higest pitch that many of them seem to point at in reformation of religion is,
the restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>of impropriations, , and crushing the pride of the swelling
Poppies or Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal clergy, and conferring that large allowance on the
Presbyterial:</hi> you cry out that <hi>a base Ministry can never do good upon
the people, and that the poverty of the Ministry is enough to bring them into
contempt, and that the church is robbed of a painful Ministry, because there is
not hony enough in the hives to feed a drone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I say you have made your selves more base by far, and brought
your selves into more contempt by your covetousnesse, and greedy gaping after
riches, then ever yet you came into by poverty, and that one Drone will devoute
more mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance if men put into his mouth as long as he will open it, as many
honest, self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying ministers will make a good shift, not only to live, but to
live to Christ on: they are not seducers that preach on cheaper terms, but the
basest Ministers, if you count that basenesse, to be destitute of liberal
maintenance, were ever yet the best Ministers of the Gospel, and the most
inriching Ministers to the people: Christ foresaw clearly enough that a rich
ministry would make but poor work in his Vineyard, therefore in his wisdome
chose not many rich, nor mighty, nor noble, but the foolish, weak, base,
abject, dispised ones in the eyes of the world, and earthen vessels to send his
treasure by into the world 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 26 27. 28. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 7. yea those
Ministers of Christ that were in afflictions, necessities, distresses, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and thirst, cold and nakednesse, poor and having nothing, that neither had, nor
provided silver nor gold, nor brasse in their purses (as <hi>Peter</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of the primitive preachers had not) were the most
pretious, plain, painful, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable preachers of the Gospell that ever the
earth bore, <hi>Matth. 10. 9. Act. 3 6. 1 Cor. 4. 11. 2 Cor. 6. 4. ad 11. 2
Cor. 11. 23. ad</hi> 28. and if mighty meanes were such a mighty means to make
able Ministers of Christ, as is pretended by you Clergymen, that tell the State
they may as well set Carpenters to build without tools, as send forth Ministars
without liberal maintenance, I wonder there are no better Ministers at
<hi>Rome,</hi> where they are maintained more like <hi>Monarchs</hi> then
<hi>Ministers</hi> of Christ: but tis a true proverb, that their <hi>golden
cups made them become such wooden Priests: Cum ecclesia peperit divitias filia
devora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit matrem:</hi> you tell the Magistrates that <hi>theyl discourage
persons from medling therwith, if they allow not large maintenance to the
Ministry,</hi> But I pray God they may never meddle more with the Ministry,
that are incouraged to enter on it with respect to maintenance, such ever more
maimed then maintained the Gospel: <hi>such which loved the gold of the altar
dearer then the altar, and Corban more then conscience,</hi> and minded the
wages more then the work as <hi>(exceptis excepien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> some few onely
excepted) the national Ministry ever did since donations of dignities from
Temporal Princes fell upon them, were ever more murderers then Ministers of the
Gospel, <hi>nil tam sanctum, the Heathen said but gold would expugne it.</hi>
You would be rich, and so fall into temptation and a snare, and into many
foolish and hurtful lusts, that drown men in destruction and perdition; your
love of money was the mother of all mischief, which while you coveted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
you were seduced from the faith: yea in these daies wherein you vow, and
protest for the faith, as if you would fain follow on to find it fully, as twas
once delivered to the Saints, youl neither find it further, nor follow it
faster then it keeps pace with your outward enjoyments, so that we may say
truely <hi>Quantum quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que sua nummorum servat in arcâ, tantum habet et
fidei:</hi> so much money as you can get by it, so much faith, religion,
reformation youl be for, and no more; yea like Lawyers, that look more at the
greatnesse of the fee, then the goodnesse of the cause, nay being feed better,
leave their old Clients and turn to <pb n="598" facs="tcp:42067:304"/> the other side, so
do many of you in these daies (wherein many run to and fro that knowledge may
be increased) turn to and fro that livings may still be established on you,
from masse, to liturgy, and back again, and back again, and then to the
directory, from all which, while you stood in the practise of them, there was
no moving you by Scripture nor reason: but <hi>qui pecunia non movetur hunc
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnum spectatu arbitramur.</hi> But you plead that the <hi>mouth of the Ox
must not be muzzled that treadeth out the Corn, that tis the will of God that
such as have sown in the Church spiritual things should reap their carnal
things, that such as preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer tis most true there is a power, and liberty allowed, for
such as serve the Church to eat and to drink, and to subsist (in case they
cannot subsist other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) at the charges of the Church, when she sets them
apart for her service, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. but it is most commendable, and
thankworthy in the Ministry to serve the Church and preach the Gospel freely,
and as far as tis possible not to be burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some in this kind at all, as namely
in case they have any estates of their own, or can improve themselves in any
such outward employment, labor or lawful calling wherby to obtain a competent
livelyhood, and lay out themselves and the gifts, that Christ hath freely given
them, in the service of Christ freely too, as men may do many times, if they be
not idle, and loving their own ease more then to ease the church of
<hi>Christ</hi> of unnecessary pressures in their purses.</p>
            <p>And thus the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> and the first Ministers of the
Gospel did, and though they pleaded a power to live upon them, in case they
could not live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, that the Church might know it to be their duty
freely to minister to their Ministers necessities, when they saw them willing
freely to expose themselves to necessities, for the truths sake, rather then
seek supersluities to themselves, yet they did not use that power they had,
much lesse abuse it too make a trade of it, but did rather suffer all things
that they might make the Gospel as little chargeable as might me 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 12. 18. yea they received wages sometimes when they went out
to warfare, i. e. to preach the Gospel up and down, so as was utterly
incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the totall maintaining of themselves, which while they abode
more set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tledly at one place, they did attend to with their own hands: for its
evident that to this end they might not hinder the Gospell from taking place in
mens hearts by seeming too much to make a trade of it, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, working
with their own hands, as ost as they could conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently, and their own hands
ministred to their own necessities, and they had some honest outward occupation
(as also Christ himself had, and sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed too, till he was wholly taken up in
travel to preach the truth, therefore <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. 3. is not this the
Carpenter?) wherein they wrought at all times, saving when they were actually
imployed in some service of preaching to the world, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, disputing,
visiting &amp;c. as is plain to him that consults these Scriptures, in the last
of which, least any should think they did more then Ministers now need

a Minister of the Gospel, not <hi>entangle himself in the affairs of this
life</hi> (for tis not good indeed that Ministers, mind the world so much as to
cumber themselves with over much business in it, that they may be more free,
then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men to please Christ, who calls them in a more special sense, then
all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to be his souldiers, yet I believe he is far from prohibiting
him in that speech from following any civil calling at all, for in the very
verse before 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. 4. he bids him <hi>endure hardnesse as a
good Souldier of Iesus Christ:</hi> yea Ministers of all men should be patient
of all things for the Gospel sake, that they hinder it not by their delicacy
<hi>viz.</hi> of hard work sometimes, and hard fare too, if occasion be, and
hunger and thirst, and cold and nakednesse, and extremities, and necessities,
and distresses, rather then lie too heavy upon the flock of 
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:42067:304"/> Christ, which is a little flock, and those few mostly
poor folks too in this world, though rich in faith, that may have more mind
then ability to Minister to their Ministers, and many of them more need to be
ministred to by their Ministers, if at any time they have abundance, then to
have their houshold-stuff strein'd, and sold, (as poor folks kettles, pots,
pans, and platters are by the Priests, and their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican tith-gatherers) to
pay them.</p>
            <p>You tell us that the first Ministers were gifted from God to
preach the Gospel <hi>extempore,</hi> and therefore well might they work, and
yet easily preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel too, but the Ministers now must attain to it by
much study, and hard pains, and therefore had need to be sequestred wholly from
all earthly imployments, that they may give themselves wholly to that work of
preaching, and to have such suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of means allowed them, as may free
them from all thoughts of other things, and furnish them to buy abundance of
books, without which tooles you say in the trade of preaching, you cannot set
up possibly to any good purpose: thus <hi>Feat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> p. 101.
<hi>prophecy</hi> (quoth he) <hi>is an extraordinary gift of the holy spirit,
preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a special faculty acquired by many years study,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Evans,</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Lords <hi>my Lords</hi> (quoth he) <hi>we
know you would have a learned Ministry, but it is impossible for learning ever
to flourish without maintenance, you may as well set carpenters to build
without tooles, as send forth Ministers without their parchments: we plead not
my Lords, for our backs, and for our bellies, but for good books; and furnisht
brains: there are some that will seduce upon cheaper tearms, but there must be
honest provision made that every Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster may have a good library, or else the
Land is like to have but an ignorant Ministry, and a perishing people: again my
Lords, we know you would have a gracious people, to fear God, honour the King,
and obey your honours; but it is sufficiently known that a base Ministry can
never do good upon the people: the generall pride of man is such, that poverty
is enough to bring a man into contempt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As if because the pride of man specially of great men, is so great
that the poor mean Ministers of Christ are subject to be despised by them,
therefore they must have a kind of pompous Priesthood that may delight their
daintines, and fit their vain fancies, and haughty humors: what the Lords of
the earth would have I know not so well as themselves, I believe they would
have a learned Ministry to lean to, and live at ease on, and a people to fear
God as far as themselves do, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom the fear of God hath been taught still
after the precepts of the men called CCClergy; and to honour the King, and obey
their Honours: but this I know, and therefore tis but flattery (not to say
foolery) to tickle them up with talk of their great zeal of the Gospel, as
their fawning Chaplains do, that few or none of their Honours are effectually
called to Christ, or have ever yet honoured him so far as to honour, own, and
acknowledge his truth in that primitive purity, wherein twas at first given
out, partly because the CCClergy claws them too much into odd conceits, and
with untempred morter dawbs them into a belief of an <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia bene</hi> in
that easie gaudy gospel they sow as a pillow under their elbowes, and partly
because not many of these mighty and nobles ones will stoop, when tis
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to them, to that plainness, and simplicity that is in Christ 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. to that foolishness of mechanick preaching, that basenesse
of baptizing, that streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of self-denying, that needlesse work of
Scripture searching with their own eyes, that weak nothing of Christs choosing,
by which to confound, and bring to nought in the end, the prudence of the
Scribes and wisemen of this world, whom they wonder after; so the great King of
Kings and Lord of Lords Christ Jesus was not over-seen, and yet he chose such
base things, and sent forth such a poor base Ministry of illiterate mechanicks
to preach his Gospel, at the first beginning of it too, which surely he would
not have done if it were his own mind, that the contempt of his ministry, which
by their poverty, illiteracy, and outward basenesse <pb n="600" facs="tcp:42067:305"/> is
apt to arise in the hearts of the proud, should be prevented by putting the
outward pomp of much earthly riches, and that low literature of this foolishly
wise world upon them?</p>
            <p>Mean while I am not against a Ministers having learning, let a man
have as much as he will on't, so he use it as a telent to serve the truth with,
when once he he hath found, and owned it: but against that necessity of outward
learning to the Ministry of Christ, so as to say (as the Priesthood doth) that
ordinarily a man cannot be a Minister of Christ without it: for verily the
spirit, which onely makes a Minister, blows where it lists, and doth (for ought
I see) bestow it self now, as of old it did, more frequently upon poor
Mechanicks and illiterate Artizans, then learned Scribes, and Schoolmen.</p>
            <p>Nor am I against a Ministers having a library, and looking into
other books if he have a mind to it, and have money enough of his own to buy
them, so be he do not lose himself therein (as the <hi>CCClergy</hi> in all
ages have done) from his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious study, and sincere search of the plain
Scripture it self: but I am far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring that poor people should be
charged to fill, and furnish Ministers studies with books, and their brains
with notions out of other Authors, that are no more to be heeded then
themselves, further then they speak according to the word: nor shall I ever
acknowledge such a necessity as you plead that men must needs busie their
braines about abundance of other mens writings, or else cannot but be ignorant
Ministers of the Gospel, sith the Scriptures themselves are of themselves (if
the CCClergy could once consider it, or one could possibly beat it into their
braines) profitable for all things, and able to make Ministers, and people wise
enough to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and to make a man of God perfect, and throughly furnisht
unto all good works, but that they do not store their hearts (as they should
do) with study of them onely, or at least mainly, as the primitive Ministers of
the Gospel did, and the purest Ministers of it now do: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14.
15. 16. I wonder what our Clergy men would do to preach the Gospel if there
were no other books extant but the very bible, they would surely either cease
from being Ministers any more at all, or else make better Ministers then they
are.</p>
            <p>I do not speak this to excite men to make such a bone fire of all
books, but the bible, as Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> saies <hi>Iohn Matthias</hi> made
p. 165. and yet (by the Clergies leave) I dare not say as Dr. <hi>Featly</hi>
there saies, that <hi>twere better all those who</hi> (in his sense) <hi>are
obstinate Sectaries</hi> (for many such are pretious Saints) <hi>were burnt at
a stake, then that such a bone fire were made,</hi> for I know no absolute
necessity to the salvation of men, of the being of any book in the world but
the bible; which as it was once alsufficient to make men wise to salvation,
without looking into any other, and before there were many other besides it, so
I know not (sith we have them in such plainness as now we have (maugre all the
malice of the Pope and Clergy, who would once have made a bone fire of the
Scriptures) why it is not as alsufficient as heretofore, whilst yet there was
no more Gospel Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture then in self: but I speak it to excite the CCClergy
(for whom I have great sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of heart to see their miserable neglect of,
&amp; wretched ignorance in the Scriptures) to give more attendance to the
reading of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as which are alsufficient, and onely necessary to a

that have been erratical in the misty moon shine of mens inventions, under the

Rabbies, Schoolmen, and Scribes that have scribled since, having learn't no
more Gospel then what the Scriptures learnt them, for I do not think they had 
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:42067:305"/> such libraries of books as are now pleaded for, which
Scripture we have as free accesse to as they then had; and have time enough to
read, and preach, and do somewhat else toward an honest livelihood too, as well
as they, if we be not idle, and fith its pleaded that their prophecying was an
extraordinary gift, of the holy spirit, but preaching now is a special faculty
attained not without many years stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the constant course of it
maintained by constant study: I say our prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyings in the Church, and
preachings to the world too, either are or ought to be all one with theirs, or
else we are not as we should be: and as no man was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister then, but by a
gift from above, so I know no man (though Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> knew so many,
that not one among an 100 of the Country Clergy, had any tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gift of
<hi>extempore</hi> prayer) that is a Minister of Christ, but the same way as
they then were <hi>viz.</hi> by a gift in some fort to make out the mind of men
to God in prayers, and the mind of God to men in preaching, whether to the
Church in way of exhortation, edification, and comfort (for that was Prophecie
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1.) or to the world in publishing the glad tidings of Gods
love to it, which is more properly preaching: I know no new way that Christ
hath chosen to make Ministers in, since the primitive times, he did not make
his Ministers then by gifts, and now by no gifts, nor yet by new gifts, he did
not make Ministers then by gifts given, and now by gifts gotten, then from
above, and now from beneath, then from heaven; and now from the universities,
then from meer knowledge of the Scriptures, and now from a muddy minglement,
and mixt messe of science falsely so called, or skill in his Scriptures, and
mens Scriptures together; then by a simple spiritual Donation, and now by a
simple fleshly Dronation in the Hive of such humane preparatives, as the Clergy
conceive the spirit to be in a manner so concerned to blow upon, as if he could
scarce have their free leave to breath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides them, but as he gave then, and
powred out his spirit as he saw good, and more ordinarily upon men that were
not learned, and wise with the wisdome of this world then on those that were,
so he does now in these latter daies, not tying himself to men, whose education
is at universities, more then to others, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more frequently filling
men illiterate, as to such science, and secular Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans then such as
those.</p>
            <p>I confesse the CCClergies preaching is a faculty attained by many

and do not chuse, nor own them to be their Ministers at all, for though the
Messengers, whose mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry lay mostly in preaching to the world, and assisting
all the Churches where they came, might and did as occasion was, not otherwise,
take wages of more Churches then one, and sometimes of some churches (that
might be richer and more free) to do other Churches service, that might happily
be neither so full, nor forward, as see 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 8. yet the
Scripture speaks thus, that such should eat of the flock that feed it 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 9. much lesse did the Pastor of one Church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take pay of the
Pastor of another in the primitive times. But you parish Priests claim pay
often of other flocks then your own; of the people of other parishes, that you
never preach to, of the gathered Churches, and their Ministers too, as they
happen to live, or to have or use houses or lands within such or such
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts, that never own you nor never will do to be their Pastors.</p>
            <p>Yea so it falls out sometimes, when one man occupies several

Priests take hold on the sk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

one poor sheep of Christ, that belongs to some seperated congregation or other,
and ownes never a one of them all to be his Pastor, saying we must have so much
of thee for such land that lyes in such a place; and so you shall have several
sheepheards at once at sharing time upon the back of one sheep, every one of
them precending to have some right or other to share him, when none of them all
have any interest in him at all as his sheep, whilest he stands in relation to
some other pastor: yea the true church may say of the Clergy constreining her
to pay to them, and so to serve their false church and Ministry, as the spouse
saith <hi>Cant. 1. they made me keeper of their vineyard,</hi> paymaster to

on you to feed them, then lies upon the people to feed you, though they be far
poorer then your selves, and you better fed then they taught; no pay no preach
is your principle, so far at least that if one people give better pay, and one

the Lord Jesus for remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins, the most inveterate enemies the pure
primitive Gospel hath, or ever had, since you reigned, to this very day, yet
for all this you must be maintained, under the notion of the ministers of the
Gospel, and that too in part by them that preach the Gospel freely, and a

whether you do the work or no, yea though you work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gospel, yet you
must have Gospel wages, thus run greedily after the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Balaam</hi>
for reward, though you have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray from
the Gospel, and are found defying, and some of you cursing, rather then
building up, and blessing the true Israel of God that do his will, yet
following the way of <hi>Balaam</hi> the son of <hi>Bosor,</hi> you love, and
look to have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and that of Israel too for this unrighteousnesse 2

maintenance, how far they may accept it is good to query) would be free to
theirs, yet you'l force the people to do that which is more then their duty to
you, and if men put not into your mouths, which are more open to call in tith
then give out truth, you prepare war: and if any say unto you or your
Assassinated Assigns, which you send for your tith, as some said of old to the
Priests servants, when they came to take the Priests due, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more then
their due out of the sacrifice, before they had offered, or done their part of
service, let them do their duty first, and then take for them as much as thy
soul desires, but we desire them to stay, and forbear to take the wages before
they have done their work, or preacht the Gospel, which they pretend to take
pay for, but for ought we find they preach against it, then these hasty
hirelings, or the hirelings they hire to help them, like the rude servants of
those wicked sons of <hi>Belial,</hi> the sons of <hi>Eli</hi> the Priests, who
made themselves vile in this kind of fatting themselves, and many more (whose
sin was therefore very great before the Lord, insomuch that the name of a

the Lord for their sakes) make answer, nay but thou shalt give it me now, and

would passe a good Arithmetician to passe his</hi> Entrado. <hi>Here take the
saying of</hi> Sixtus <hi>the fourth that a Pope could never want money while
he could hold a pen in his hand, yet is their Treasury seldome fall, for 1. the
State they keep because of their height of honor above all Princes; 2. the
large allowance they give unto their Legates, Nuncios and other Ministers; and
3. their greedy desires to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich their Sons, or Kinsmen with the Churches

Gorgeousnesse of the Papal vestmets, and <pb n="608" facs="tcp:42067:309"/> especially that
of the tripple Crown, for when</hi> Clement <hi>the sist transferred his seat

            </p>
            <p>If all this treasuring up of trash be not covetousnesse, excuse me
if I know not what else to make of it: it would make me laugh (as sorry as I
am, for all such hereticizing and Schismatizing among the Ministers from
primitive plainnesse, as hath been) to see a <hi>Clergy</hi> man stand up and
tell me now, that much maintenance is a necessary means, whereby to enable
ministers of <hi>Christ</hi> to promote the Gospell, specially if they consider
how this covetousnesse hath caused the <hi>CCClergy</hi> in all

traditions of one another, that s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

lucre or learning could prevent the corruption, or cure the ignorance of the

such is the resolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the CCClergy to bind the people still to a blind
obedience to their blind guidance of them beside the word; that
<hi>Disputations</hi> with them <hi>if not carefully,</hi> I mean clearly, and

without zeal against their evils (which yet we must not abate them an ace of

<hi>Raise more evil spirits</hi> of wrath and divellishnesse in them then we

earnest enquiries after truth in the people, who before were wont to take their
ware on trust without tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, then <hi>then they can lay</hi> again while they
live by all the shifts and subtleties they can devise; for when once people are
resolved to believe things to be heresie <pb n="612" facs="tcp:42067:311"/> by heatsay no
more, but to fancy them according as they find them in the word, and to see
into the plainness of speech that is in the Scripture with their own eyes, they
see so much disproportion between the national Church wayes, and those of the
primitive Churches of the Gospel, that they commonly resolve not to see at all
adventures through the unclear eyes of CCClergy men any more:</p>
            <p>This makes them fie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and nailes, if they can tell how, or else to cleave whole Countries asunder
with beetle and wedges: <hi>Heresie is said by the Apostle to fret like a
canker</hi> so that <hi>it is not</hi> the clearness, nor yet the coolness, nor
yet <hi>the heat of a disputation can correct</hi> it in some mens hearts;
<hi>the tongue may heal any poisoned wound with licking of it sooner then that
which the Heretick,</hi> the Pope and the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood <hi>hath made,</hi> so
deeply hath he found his heresies in the dark cells of some mens implicit

CCCreatures, as stand bent to believe all they say, and never doubt it, though
otherwise much good may come to others, that are inquisitive, by disputation
with them, <hi>or that he which is possessed with self love, and hunts so
greedily after glory or gain</hi> as the CCClergie does, <hi>should be
perswaded to hearken to any reason, which contradicts his principles, or to

               <hi>What is the result of this discourse, to forbid all
disputation</hi> with HHHim? no <hi>by no means, it is necessary to stop the

his challenge be not answered and make our silence be a confession of the truth
on his side, if he be not stoutly encountred with. Saint Austin who was in his
time</hi> called <hi>Malleus hereticorum, of whom it is said that he never went
so willingly to a feast as to a conference when Pascentins the Arrian bragd
that he had worsted him in his dispute, and those believed it, which desired
it, yet gave not out from disputing, but was onely care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to set down his
disputations in writing for the future, that the truth might appear vindicated
from thofe false reports, with which commonly it is blasted,</hi> either by
word, or else by some such true counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Accounts in print, as that which
is at this day extant of the disputation held at <hi>Ashford.</hi>

               <hi>A Disputation orderly carried, soberly proceeded with, without
heats, and distempered passions, not suffered to go out of its due bounds nor
to follow every new sent, that is taken up by the way,</hi> nor to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
into quarrellings, and hasty fals chargings of the Anabaptists as this, and
that, &amp; they know not what, without proving them such, or disproving their
doctrines (as, if others do not, I do know more then one place where, and where

Gospel, Baptism, Church order, which was once delivered to the Saints, and been

SSSeducer: it is rare so to mannage one among an unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful multitude where the

ready,</hi> on all hands too much, but an 100 fold more (for ought I find)
among the parochial party then the other, <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly to break the lists
which hath made so many able Scholars</hi> not in mans onely, but in Christs
School also, almost <hi>averse from undertaking it; but unless their be
sufficient caution against such exorbitatances,</hi> as jangling with bells to
drownd all audience of truth, and counter speeches of non-sense, rather then
nothing, to interrupt him that is about to speak the truth, and noise of
shouting, if it were possible, to shame the truth, and such like geer as I have
met with in my daies, <hi>better be no disputation at all,</hi> nor preaching
of truth among such, <hi>it being</hi> (if not a giving of that which is holy
to dogs, and casting of pearles before swine, which will turn again and rent
you, yet) at least <hi>impossible any thing should come of it</hi> that good is
(and yet even that shall be no hurt to the Ministers of Christ, that are
approved in tumults, yet cannot help it) <hi>but blasphemy to the truth,
stumbling to the weak</hi> parishioners, that stumble enough already poor souls
(the Lord help them) to see their preachers violently oppose preaching, and
proving the truth out of the Scriptures; a kind of shamefull <hi>Glory to the
adversaries</hi> of the truth, the PPPriesthood from some, a glorious <hi>shame
to the undertakers</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is therefore a better way for the</hi> true <hi>Pastors
of the</hi> true <hi>Churches,</hi> and specially the Churches messengers to
the world, in which <hi>to oppose the approach of heresies,</hi> which the
parish Pastors make mickle use of to oppose the truth by under the names of
Anabaptism, <hi>at least in their Respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive flocks</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">see the last clause of the first part of
  the Ashford pamphlet p. 11.</note> 
               <hi>and that is by preaching. To argue
substantially against them, to convince them soundly, is the best in the
pulpit,</hi> if they can freely get in, a place wherein one might have hid ones
self for a month together or more, and sometimes a year from some parish
Priests, non-resident Parsons, divinity Doctors, but specially the lazy Lord
Bishops not very long since, but now, to keep out the Anabaptists, more
frequented by some Priests then else it would be, a place, <hi>which is
secured</hi> much, and yet not alwayes neither when plain truth tellers are in
it, <hi>from those incursions to which disputations are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. It is worth
observation that neither Transubstantion, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantion have so much as
appeared in these days, wherein so many old Heresies,</hi> as infant sprinkling
for one, which as, a mad bul having its deaths blow on the forehead, struggles
more then ever, <hi>are</hi> in a sort <hi>revived,</hi> and stickled for, and
plyed, with new and fresh assaults, and unheard of arguments, for twas pleaded

broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the reason is because</hi> all <hi>Ministers</hi> in these
parts good and bad, true, &amp; false even the Priests themselves <hi>in their
Sermons provided for the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have every where oppugned them,</hi> as
having indeed no cleer colour in them of either Scripture, common sense or
reason, as neither hath infantsprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, if the National Ministers would once
wisely consider it. <hi>The learned Hooker observes that in Poland so many
Arrians sprung up because the Nicence faith was neglected there,</hi> and
<hi>had we</hi> Baptists in our Ministry of old <hi>been careful to preach
for</hi> the true way of baptizing believers onely, when <hi>the baptism of
infants</hi> first began to come up, and creep upon superstitious grounds into
the Church, <hi>It would certainly have hindred the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of that
reasonlesse Rantism, and freed the Churches, that now return to the 
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:42067:312"/> onely true baptism again, which they let go, from that
simple censure <hi>of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism,</hi> which now they passe under from men
that take rantism to be baptism: <hi>at least our flocks</hi> in those daies,
that followed the truth, <hi>had been so well provided, as that they would not
so easily have departed</hi> (as they did) <hi>from that</hi> plain way of the
word in point of baptism: <hi>Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula

consequence viz. that faith and Gospel, which was once delivered unto the
Saints, for here indeed she gives place by subjection neither to ghostly

            <p>When therefore they shall say unto you ask the Priest, seek unto
us, I say seek not unto them, that say they seek, but are loath to find
themselves, or at least are afraid that men should find, and see all that,
which they cannot clearly deny to be the truth: seek not to them that peep, and
that mutter, and speak not out, as if the matter were not momentary to be
mentioned, as if they were in a quanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whether it be safe or no to seek too
seriously after the truth out, should not a people seek unto their God? for the
living to the dead? to the law, and to the testimony your selves oh yee people,
if they speak not plainly according to the word, it is because there is no
light in them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Ask therefore the High Priest Christ Jesus and <hi>if you cannot
be resolved</hi> so speedily as you desire <hi>to your</hi> satisfaction and
<hi>content, be content to stay till God shall reveal:</hi> in the mean time,
while you doubt, suspend the practise, and do nothing doubtingly, but
<hi>exercise your selves the while in searching the Scripture and prayer,</hi>
to which pretious practise God hath made many pretious promises in his word as
namely, <hi>That they shall be undefiled in the way that seek the Lord, with
their whole heart: Psalm 119. 1, 2. That if thou wilt turn at his reproof,

which all are high degrees of sin, yet <hi>he will powre out his spirit upon
thee,</hi> which happily hath been thy laughing stock, <hi>and make known his
words unto thee,</hi> Prov. 1. 22. 23. that if thou wilt receive <hi>his words
and hide his commaddements within thee, If thou incline thine ear unto wisdom
and apply thy heart unto understanding, yea if thou cryest after knowledge, and
liftest up thy voice for understanding, if thou seekest her as silver, and
searchest for her as for hid treasure, then thou shalt understand the fear of
the Lord, and find the knowledge of God</hi> Prov. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Yet <hi>be assured of this, humble ignorance in many questions
debated in these daies</hi> by Divines, and also in old timebefore us by
learned <hi>Schoolmen</hi> and <hi>Casuists,</hi> and by the Popish priests,

humble igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance about the ordinances of Christ as our Priesthood would hold
men in, as if the Law and Oracles of Christ, which are all plain to him that
understandeth, were in things necessary to salvation so difficult, and obstruse
that poor mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks must meddle no more int then they have leave from them;
<hi>in facili et a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perto postta est salus, the way of salvation is plain to be
found in the book of God, he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved:
Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord for remission
of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the holy spirit:</hi> but the
PPPriesthood hath led men the next way round about to salvation, and framed a
new Gospel for their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, which Scripture makes no mention of at all:
but as <hi>those Israelites that were led up and down the wildernesse so long
God had sworne should not enter into his xest,</hi> so neither shall those
Christians, that, when the truth lyes plain before them, delight rather to
trace to and fro in the thicket of traditions received from their after
forefathers, then in the way of the first fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, and love more

Christ is come to no less; the Rantizer and the Ranter also are both sad
examples to us, how fearsul a thing it is to run away from the plain path of
the word of Christ, the one whereof, when he ran down once, but so far as to
take upon him to mend Christs ordinances, and teach for doctrine his own
traditions, never left adding more and more of his own odd constitutions, till
he sunk ore head and ears in a gulf of golden legends, and a lake of lies; the

you (and the Lord judge between you and me whether I speak the truth or not) I
am so far from desiring the temporal, much more the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal destruction of any

spare sharpness toward you, or in silence suffer you to perish, as I verily
believe (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore speak the more plainly to you, that by any means I may
save some of you) without remedy you will do, persisting in your wonted
obstinacy against the Gospel: this being the faith which God hath begotten me
to, by a serious search and observation of the word and world together, the
saith which he hath for some years made me to live in, and will (I trust if he

would arise many other wayes, yea the Lord pleadeth it before you day by day by
the tongues and pens of others besides my self, but I neverthelesse might be

perceiving (like <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> who thought it had been <hi>Eli</hi> that
called him, and not the Lord) whether it were the suggestion of Gods spirit or
my own, and when at last I understood clearly that twas the Lord himself, that
told me he would do such a thing to the house of <hi>Eli</hi> i. e. the
Generation of the Priesthood as should cause the eares of all that hear it to
tingle, I feared likewise to shew <hi>Eli</hi> the vision, and was as loath to
declare, as you OPPPriests are to hear the things concerning you here declared;

then ours is wrong, and if ever it appear we shall come back to you, if ours be

me about,</p>
            <p>First, you'l ask me <hi>why I do not for the peace sake of the

baptism, which (when it serves your turn so to do) you call a circumstantial
matter, a ceremony for which (if you should erre therein) none but weak &amp;
querulous consciences will complain and separate, an indifferent thing for
which why should we make so much ado? a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>at, not to be streind at and such like, <hi>is so
necessary a matter, one of the most necessary points of Religion, which those
that erre in do most fearfully erre, and are totally deserted by the spirit of
God,</hi> these are your own words.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you talk much (and tis the language of the Pope to your
selves since you reat from his Church) of the Church, and our holy mother the
Church, and Ghostly fathers of the Church, and good and true tempered sons of
the Church, and the peace of the Church, and Schismaticks in the Church,
&amp;c. wherewith you astonish the vulgar, but I protest this day before God;
and men, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against him, against whom you are Protestants also, but
against your selves also his Schismatical sons, who own his ordinations, and
still walk in some of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, <hi>viz. Rantism, Parochial posture</hi>
&amp;c. as those that are little lesse igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant then he, and his good sons, of
both the true Church, and true peace thereof, whilst the truth, to which she
should submit, is not regarded by you, and the very things that make a true
visible Church, and are <hi>de esse</hi> and <hi>constitutive</hi> of it, so
that abstract them, and you null it <hi>viz.</hi> true matter i. e. believers
baptized, and true form i. e. free and not forced fellowship, both which are so
in the Churches of <hi>England, Scotland, Italy, France</hi> and
<hi>Spain,</hi> are not onely wanting, but also trodden under your feet.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the peaceable way wherein we propagate these opinions,
were you as sure they are erroneous, as I am tha tyou'l once find them to be
truth, will yetexcuse, and acquit us from all guilt of disturbing the peace of
either the world, or your Church, which is the world in reference to the true
one; and unlesse you can say the Gospel of peace, which where ere it comes,
occasions dissentions, is the cause of them, as in no wise it is, but mens
lusts rather that rage, and take on against it, you cannot say our Gospel is;
for it propounds them to the world in no other way then that, and that way was
no other then bare propounding them: and as Christ and his disciples did not
judge them here, though they will judge them most severely hereafter, who
reject their words, by the power of the Magistrate, by the civil sword, by
nailing to pillories, cutting off ears, slitting noses, whippings, fines,
confiscations, prisons, bonds, banishments, fightings, fire, and fagot, the
bloody wayes whereby BBBabilon hath edified it self to that height of
abomination, the Arguments whereby the CCClergy were wont to convert Hereticks
quickly from all error to dust, and ashes; so if any man hear our words and
reject them, well may we rebuke him sharply, as they also did, but we judge him
not, in that way whereby the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> that hath levied war for
his lusts sake against the whole earth, hath bereft all men of peace:
neverthelesse the words that we speak to him, being those that Christ and his
disciples have spoken in the world, the same will judge him at the last
day.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>why</hi> (sith it must needs be supposed there be
many Godly men among the Ministers of the Nations, though the most of them be
wicked yet) <hi>I do not except, and exempt them, when I inveigh so heavily
against the CCClergy? or <pb n="626" facs="tcp:42067:318"/> why I do not rather forbear,
and spare to speak so broad at all, and so generally as I do against that
generation as an evill one, for the sake of those good ones, that are among
them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I say,</p>
            <p>First, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> godly men properly are those
onely that worship God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, i. e. according to his own will and
institution, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which well weighed might possibly 
<note place="margin">* Mat. 15. 9.</note> put the best men among you
to your trumps to make good your title to that title, and denomination of godly
by Scripture record, sith while you stand among the rest, even you as well as
the worst do preach, and practise for doctrines of Christ some traditions of
man, if you had no more enjoined you by them, on whom you wait for your
instructions, then barely the sprinkling of infants, by which you make void,
what in you is, the true baptism of Christ.</p>
            <p>Yet not denying but that there is a sprinkling of honest hearts
<hi>quorum meliori luto sinxit praecordia Titan,</hi> whom the sun of
righteousnesse, as he lightens every man that cometh into the world, hath
hatcht up into a higher predicament of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse then their fellowees, who
are drawn up into some higher streins of devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the rest, I adde
further.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what are these littles to the lump? what is the gleaning
to the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? here and there one good man to the whole corrupt crue of them,
that like Locusts, and Caterpillars have spread themselves together with the
smoak of errors over the earth in three several swarms or armies? can some
scores of well meaning Priests give the denomination of an holy
<hi>PPriesthood,</hi> godly Ministry to those legions of them that lie in
wickednesse? you may as well say theres a million of Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the men of
the world, therefore reprove not the world for their sakes: such as these, who
out of meer simple honesty, rather then sinful sophistry and mystical iniquity
do stand, and act, and argue against the true way as they do, are <hi>Rarae
aves,</hi> very few to the multitude of humanists, and sensual ones, and subtle
subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Gospel (which yet they would seem to be Ministers of) for
their own ends; by whom they are commonly so hated too so far as they have any
more stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctnesse and sincerity then ordinary, that they are among the other of
their brethren (as I was for querying after truth while I stood among them) as
owles and bats baired by other birds: which few good grapes were they better
then they are, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not denominate the whole vintage, as <hi>una

BBBabilon is BBBabilon still, and SSSodom is SSSodom, and must be called so,
though <hi>Lot</hi> live in it, and he called out of it too, unlesse he mean
mean to perish with it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, those good men that are there (the mores the pitty that
they are so) ought not to be suffered nor spared, but spoke to the rather
themselves, and that very roundly too, for being and abiding in a bad way, and
not the way it self, and those many bad men that are in it scape declaring
against, as bad, because of them: there must be down-right dealing with upright
men, when they are in a wrong way, and that indeed is the most upright dealing
with them of all: yea <hi>Sirs,</hi> you that are upon the Account of these
times for godly Ministers, let me say this to you, for verily I have sorrow of
heart for some of you of my old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, my own flesh and blood, for
whose sakes flesh in me would fain be silent, as knowing flesh in you would
fain be let a lone, but I must urge you to be serious in seeing how unsafely
you satisfie your selves in your present fellowship with a carnal Clergy: what
make you among the prophane Ministry of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that hath in all ages
sate with such weight upon them, as to sink them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a gulf of error, so that
all truth almost is heresie with them now, and under ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of being
smoothered as soon as it peepes out from under that veil of tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that
hath covered it? what make you keeping a Court of guard among the Babilonians
to help to hold them in captivity still, at least in the Suburbs, and by the
borders of Babilon, where you yet linger and loiter for all your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences 
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:42067:318"/> and protestations to go quite home with them, that are
resolved fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>shly
minded men, as the main body of the national mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry consists of in all
Europe? for tis evident you'l enter into the lists, and make head with the
worst of them, even with the Pope himself, against any further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of
truth, then will stand with your standing among them, though the Lord makes out
the truth more clear, and you seem in your prayers to desire him so to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> yea I am almost ashamed to
utter what I see, I see preciseness and propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness go hand in hand to keep out
the true Righteousness indeed.</p>
            <p>So that if I speak to the whole body of the CCClergy throughout
the earth, as very often I do, yet I bespeak you no otherwise then I find you
<hi>viz.</hi> whether for this or for that in particular, yet all banded in one
general body against the truth; for as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi>
though at enmity could yet agree as friends against Jesus, so you though of
never so different complexions, and constitutions, lives, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations,
doctrines, and disciplines, forms and fashions, and goverments and Gospels, yet
are all friends to Christs crucifying in his disciples: yea how implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly are
you at odds among your selves, one sort of you being for the suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the
Pope, another for the Super-intendeny of the Bishop, a third for the
superstitions of the Synods, others for they scarce know which, and they care
not what, but as the temper of the times doth dispose them; some Rantizing
infants from one ground <hi>viz.</hi> because its a tradition, some denying
that, and disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as both a rotten, and false one, yet
<hi>Romanizing</hi> still from some other, some, and those the most, more
loose, a few more strict in their manners, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all which variety,
you are at unity still, i. e. at emnity against the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Christ.</p>
            <p>But should you help the ungodly, and love them that hate the Lord?
surely wrath will be upon you with them from the Lord: If you
<hi>Iehosophats</hi> i. e. the honest Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in whom good things are
found, who have taken away the groves, and much more of that Romish rubbish
then your father <hi>Asa</hi> i. e. the good old, Bishops did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, if
you good <hi>Iehosaphats I</hi> say, will after all this join with the wicked
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs</hi> that trouble Israel, in imprisoning the <hi>Michaiahs,</hi> at
least by a silent assent, and with the <hi>Ahaziahs</hi> that do wickedly, so
as to lay your heads together for ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loads of Gold, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 31.
19. 2. 20. 35. 26. 38. for more means and maintenance, saying to them, we are
in this point as you are, our people as your peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, our parishes as your
parishes, our Articles of faith herein as your Articles of faith, our way of
maintenance as yours, and we will be with you in the warre to reduce the
<hi>Giliadites,</hi> the sectaries, that should be subject to us, to our
obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: your ships and all your projects, works and councels will be
broken, and disappointed as the others, what ever may become of your persons:
true men in a false way are out of Gods protection, as well as hypocrites in a
true.</p>
            <p>Therefore depart ye from the tents of those ungodly men, yea arise
and depart from that Papistical posture of parish Churches, and Pastoral
relation to such as are not sheep, which not Christ Iesus, but the Pope stated
men in at first, for this is not your rest because it is polluted, it will
destroy you with a sore destruction; whereupon come out from them and be ye
seperate, yea come out of her come out of her, ye that are Christs people (for
Christs Ministers you are not, though never so good men, by Antichrists orders)
and partake no longer with her in her sins, least ye partake also of her
plagues.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Godlinesse and honesty of mens persons doth not
prove the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and truth of the outward form and way of Church-order they
are in, nor must hinder the overturning it if false, who will say many of these
under the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy were not good men? if good men stand in a bad place,
soil, or posture, they have so much the more need to be removed as trees, and
transplanted into a better: for many of you Presbyters that go for godly were

that false Episcopal form as now, and some of you somewhat more (for its much
to be feared that the settling of you in the same <hi>Hierarchy</hi> over the

surely would not so have so soon forgot that ere he was Clark as to have gone
about (so high Presbytery did but that God prevented him of his purpose) so
soon as ever he was gotten out of his own growning condition, and kept from the

bad, and much more to blame then others, for not seeing your model to be

rotten a fabrick: why therefore since your domination is the same, and your
government as Tyrannicall as the other, the extent of your dominions the same,
for they rule but over all, and you over no more then you can subject, the
subject matter of your churches the same <hi>viz.</hi> whole <hi>England,</hi>
whole <hi>Scotland,</hi> whole Common-wealths, the whole world at once, if it
would as Catholikely submit to your directory, as it did once to the Popes, in
point of worships, and payments, at least, whether godly in their conversations
or no, your parish form the same, your Ministry a Ministry by the same orders,
and mostly of the same men, new moulded, not so much in mind and manners, as in
manner of ministration according to the laws for alteration, in a word your
whole Hierarchy, though new suited, so far the same, that you are no lesse
Cozen Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane to them, then they two are one unto another, why may it not, I
say, be proportionably reproved, notwithstanding a number of honest and godly
men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those, that are not more numberlesse, then so godlesse, that they
may well say of themselves, <hi>Nos numeri sumus fruges consumere
nati?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Specially since the best men are by so much unworthy to
be justifyed, &amp; favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the false form they are found in, by how much,
in some respects, they do more wrong to the truth, then the very worst that are
in that wrong way with them.</p>
            <p>For though the wicked Ministers are the worst, both to themselves
and to all others otherwise, whether Popes, Prelates, Presbyters, or Popish
Priests of of any kind, yet herein the best are worst, and even more injurious
then any <hi>viz.</hi> as they are greater stumbling blocks to some, and, by
standing still in a superstitious way, stand more in the way of such as (living
more at a venture by their example in all things then the word) would else
escape it, then prophane ones are capable to do: thus pious Priests, that are
adored as Popes in their several parishes, <pb n="629" facs="tcp:42067:319"/> more dazzle
their peoples eyes from discovering the whole mystery both iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and
godlynesse, then dissolute, rude, proud, paultry ones possibly can, when once
the Gospel comes among them: yea, <hi>Pope Caelestinus, Pope Clemens, Pope
Innocentius, Pope Pius, Pope Formosus, Pope Urbanus,</hi> do more cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
their cures to continuance in crooked customes, then either <hi>Leo,</hi> or
<hi>Helbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi> When men in a false Ministry are any better then ordinary
in their persons, though never so Antichristian in their performances, yet how
many are hardened to the heeding of these, as Christian enough for their sakes:
but when they are not onely traditionary in their services, but impious and
impenitent in their lives, this renders not onely their deformation more
discernable, but also reformation more desirable then else it would be; so as
<hi>corruptio optimi est pessima,</hi> the pervertures of good men are most
prejuditious, if not pernitious to the truth, <hi>ex malis mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus bonae
nascuntur leges,</hi> the parish Ministers immodest manners makes modest men
look out for some better lawes and Gospel.</p>
            <p>Theres one thing more I know you will charge me with (for you
<hi>Ashford Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputants</hi> did once before thousands, when there was
(seemingly) lesse occasion then now, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>I am too sharp and
Satyrical, that I rail at and revile you, in stiling you an Adulterous
generation, Antichristian, Hereticall, Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I say, first that, though some of you would have muzzled
me up then, by an Article, from that which you call reviling, least happily I
should have unmaskt you too much, yet, in your sense, that Article shall not
bind me at this time (with your leave) for you call that reviling that is not
so: would you set your selves soberly once to reason things out, i. e. to
discern them properly as they are, you would find, that no man is reviled that
is seasonably and soberly declared, and denominated to be but what he is: for
be the titles we note men by never so grosse, yet are they but their proper
names, if in all things suitable to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: hence (though I can excuse
your ignorance in terming me Anabaptist, for thats impropriation indeed) yet
Ile more then pardon you, print me out how you will, so you print me no worse
then you prove me: and as for me whatever stile I put upon you, as I do it in a
serious and not lusory way, so I make it out to be your due: as also what you
Presbyters put upon the Prelates, and you Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates upon the Popedome,
<hi>viz.</hi> the denomination of Antichristian, Strumpet, <hi>Babylon,</hi>
and such like, you make plainly enough appear to be their due, and therefore I
cannot possibly be said properly to revile you, forasmuch as upon the self same
Account as you cry out upon each other and use these disgracefull and
opprobious termes (as you term them) towards one another, I (as justly) cry out
in the same language against you all; unlesse you will yield to it, as I know
you will not, that you are Revilers your selves.</p>
            <p>If what I say of you be indeed more then the truth, Ile not onely
expect your contradiction, but accept thankfully your correction of me from the
word; but if you cannot from thence deny but that I call you what you are, then
as you will not be guilty of overcharging your selves as well as me, you must
acquit me from the guilt of reviling, for as I lend you no worse language then
you lend one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the like cases, so as I plead my innocency in it, must
you plead your own else can you be held guiltlesse no more then I, but we must
all be revilers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
