         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IF thou knew'st the <hi>Author</hi> of these following Discourses, it
is needless to say any thing to thee concerning <hi>him</hi> or <hi>them.</hi>
And if thou art still a stranger to him, it is pity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thee from so profitable an Acquaintance as thou may'st
yet most happily redeem with <hi>him,</hi> by these his <hi>Excellent Works<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
in which he has given us a much better Account of himself,
than it is possible now to receive from any other hand.</p>
            <p>However, the Publisher professes so great a Love and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for his Person, and is so great an Admirer of these, and all
other Discourses of his, whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he has yet seen, that he dare not
venture to tell thee his own thoughts of <hi>either,</hi> lest he should
offend against the <hi>Spring,</hi> whilst he commends the <hi>Stream.</hi> Vpon
this and some other considerations, which are to him of much
weight, he declines doing any thing that may pretend to look like
a <hi>Preface;</hi> and believes upon thy due perusal of what is here
presented to thee, thou wilt easily justifie his Modesty and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
herein. Nor wilt thou then wonder that our <hi>Author,</hi> and
this <hi>his Book</hi> addresses thee so directly, and without the <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations</hi>
of some of the <hi>Greater Lights</hi> and <hi>Rabbies</hi> of our
present Times. It would indeed be a new thing for a Person,
and Discourses so very heavenly and spiritual, to receive such a
<pb facs="tcp:49838:3"/>
complement; and especially in an <hi>Age</hi> which has all along disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
such a <hi>watchful jealousie</hi> over, and <hi>opposition</hi> to all the
<hi>encreases</hi> and <hi>growths</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> above the pitch and stature of
Opinions and Principles commonly received among us. An <hi>Age,</hi>
which instead of forgetting those things which are <hi>behind,</hi> and
reaching forth unto those things which are <hi>before,</hi> as the Apostle
speaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 13. has taken up its rest and satisfaction in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>measures</hi> and <hi>attainments,</hi> making them the <hi>Rule,</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi>

                  </gap>est,</hi> and the <hi>Standard</hi> to all the further discoveries and
breakings forth of God in the midst of us. It has still been the
<hi>Lot</hi> of the Divinest Births, and Appearances of God in this
lower World, to be most <hi>solitary</hi> and neglected as to an outward
pomp and attendance. They are reserved for the <hi>Glory</hi> and
<hi>Triumph</hi> of <hi>another day.</hi> We read indeed of a <hi>Ruler,</hi> who
came to <hi>Christ</hi> by night, being drawn by the fame of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
and of the <hi>Multitude</hi> following <hi>him</hi> for the Loaves:
but upon that most spiritual Sermon of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s in the 6th
<hi>chap.</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> the Text tells us, <hi>Many of the Disciples went
back, and walked no more with him:</hi> And that the <hi>Twelve</hi>
were themselves so stagger'd, that <hi>our Lord</hi> saies unto them,
<hi>Will ye a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>so go away?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving then our Author, and his Book among those <hi>excellent</hi>
and <hi>best</hi> things, whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> have alwaies stood <hi>alone</hi> in this World,
and been contented so to do; I now apply my self to the proper ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of these Lines, which is to acquaint thee, that these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
are <hi>posthumous,</hi> and not designed for the Press, when
they were first Preached; but are now made publick, to answer
the <hi>imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtunities</hi> of particular Friends, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>requiring</hi> of a
more universal Charity, that so much Goodness should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative.</p>
            <p>This is the reason, why in the diligent perusal of this Book,
thou wilt find an omission of some few Heads of Disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urse, as to
the particular enlargement upon them, both in the Sermons upon
<hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and those upon the 45th <hi>Psalm:</hi> As also why neither
of those Discourses are compleatly finished: Those few particular
<hi>Heads</hi> being forgotten by our Author in his Original Copy, which
<pb facs="tcp:49838:3"/>
is here exactly observed; and he by his death prevented bringing
of either Discourse to their desired and designed perfection.</p>
            <p>I must also acquaint thee, that <hi>the State of a Saint's Soul and
Body in death,</hi> which makes the <hi>last part</hi> of this Book, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by our Author, as an Introduction only to several <hi>Sermons</hi>
which he afterwards Preached upon that <hi>Argument,</hi> from those
two Scriptures, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4 14. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. in which he
dispatch'd the several <hi>Heads</hi> enumerated in the <hi>beginning,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
those which are wanting at the <hi>end</hi> of that Discourse, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>first</hi> consolation and joy of death to a Saint; which
Sermons, to the Reader's great satisfaction had been here publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as the Author's <hi>finishing strokes</hi> to his excellent <hi>representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Death, had they not proved his <hi>own Funeral Discourses;</hi>
for before he could give us a <hi>Copy</hi> of them, or correct <hi>one,</hi> which
was imperfectly taken from his mouth, <hi>he died;</hi> confirming to us
his <hi>Belief</hi> of what he had deliver'd upon that <hi>Subject,</hi> by his
hastening to the highest <hi>proof</hi> thereof, which is <hi>enjoyment.</hi>
However, it is judg'd worth the Reader's while, to make what
our Author design'd for the <hi>beginning</hi> of several other Discourses,
to be the <hi>conclusion</hi> of these, it being so sweet a <hi>strain</hi> in his
<hi>Dying Song,</hi> and so admirable an expression of his <hi>Victory</hi> and
<hi>Triumph</hi> over the <hi>King of Terrors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must also tell thee, that some few Errata's have escaped the
Press, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h the more intelligent may rectifie as they read;

corrected in the end of the Book. 'Tis hoped the Reader
will not think it <hi>one,</hi> that these Discourses are Printed in no

               </gap>t him no fairer a <hi>Margent,</hi>
because we have herein consulted his Purse, and taken care he
should buy as little waste Paper as was possible in the purchase of
this Book. Nor will the understanding Reader complain it wants
the Ornament of a large empty Margent, or the ostentation of one
filled with Learned Quotations, whilst in the reading of it, he will
find our Author has given him throughout his Book all manner
of <hi>Humane,</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> learning, after the best sort; Well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
and converted into an excellent <hi>habit, strength,</hi> and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49838:4"/>
And now <hi>Reader,</hi> I have only some few requests to present to
<hi>thee</hi> for <hi>thy own sake,</hi> rather then our <hi>Authours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It is probable thou maist here meet with some things
which not onely from the <hi>manner</hi> of the expression, but chiefly
from the <hi>matter</hi> of them, may be <hi>difficult,</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.
My request here is, Thou would'st take great care not
to <hi>Judge</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> what thou art not able first to <hi>hear</hi>
and <hi>understand,</hi> lest by t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y rash Censures thou should'st
blindly rush upon <hi>the hiding of power,</hi> which the Prophet <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bakkuk</hi>
speaking of <hi>Christ in the Spirit,</hi> tells us, <hi>Chap. 3.
ver. 4. is in his hand.</hi> That is, <q>In the spiritual discoveries
of Christ, which are as hands of light, by which he puts forth
himself, and taks hold of the World. </q>As our Author some where
expresses himself upon those words. Who among us is yet able
to comprehend all the distinct <hi>ages</hi> and <hi>growths</hi> of good minds;
To understand the various <hi>Improvements, measures</hi> and <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
the several <hi>capacities, languages</hi> and <hi>operations,</hi> which
are peculiar to those <hi>ages</hi> and <hi>growths?</hi> It is impossible for us to
set the <hi>bounds</hi> to spiritual things; To stint <hi>that Spirit</hi> in our
selves or others which is a <hi>fountain</hi> of Divine Light and Life in
all regenerated Souls, continually sending forth new streams, and
running along with afresh succession of Waters without any stop or
limit. We are too <hi>proud</hi> to understand the <hi>condescentions,</hi> too
<hi>low</hi> to take the <hi>height,</hi> too <hi>shallow</hi> to fathom the <hi>depth,</hi> too <hi>nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>

is <hi>common, carnal, formal</hi> and <hi>superstitious.</hi> As we ought not
then to despise, and contemn that which is <hi>below;</hi> So let us not
censure and condemn that which is <hi>above</hi> us. Blessed be God <hi>all
Good Souls</hi> in the midst of their greatest distances from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
here below do all <hi>meet</hi> in the <hi>Divine Comprehension</hi> above.
We are all enfolded in the Divine Arms, we are all encircled in
the Divine Love. That has <hi>breadth,</hi> and <hi>length,</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:49838:4"/>
               <hi>height</hi> enough to reach, and hold us all. And if we cannot yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and embrace each other in our several ages, growths measures,
and attainments, it is because we have little, low, dark, narrow
and contracted hearts, feel but little of the love of Christ, and are
no more fill'd with that Spirit which is the <hi>spring,</hi> the <hi>center,</hi> the
<hi>circle,</hi> the <hi>band</hi> to all good Spirits in heaven, and on Earth. There
is as great a difference in the <hi>statures</hi> of <hi>Souls,</hi> as of <hi>bodies;</hi> In
the <hi>growths</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> as of <hi>men</hi> and all other things. St.
<hi>John, Joh. 12. &amp;c.</hi> distinguishes these <hi>growths</hi> into <hi>little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
Young men, Fathers,</hi> twice together; That we might take
the more distinct notice of them. Our <hi>Author</hi> was in the <hi>highest</hi>
of these <hi>ranks;</hi> Was indeed one of the <hi>tallest</hi> among his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
whether we consider the <hi>height</hi> of his own spiritual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
and enjoyments, or the <hi>depth</hi> of his condescentions to
the <hi>lowest</hi> and <hi>least</hi> of <hi>them.</hi> For the <hi>true stature</hi> of any thing
cannot be exactly taken without measuring from <hi>both ends. That</hi>
is not truly <hi>tall</hi> or <hi>great</hi> which seems to stand high, and look big,
but <hi>that</hi> which reaches <hi>furthest,</hi> which is most <hi>extensive, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending</hi>
and <hi>Universal.</hi> Our <hi>Author</hi> was indeed a <hi>true Father in
Christ,</hi> and so esteemed by all who knew him For his own great
<hi>understanding,</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> in Divine things, for the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
of his <hi>Ministery,</hi> whereby he did <hi>in Jesus Christ tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the Gospel</hi> beget and edifie many; As also for the great <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi>
and <hi>Father like bowels</hi> which throughout his whole Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
and in all his other converses, he delighted to be still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
towards all the <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>little ones.</hi> Nor was his <hi>skill</hi>
herein less considerable than his <hi>Naturalness.</hi> This Character thou
wilt find eminently due to him as thou perusest these <hi>discourses,</hi> in
which he is still careful to provide <hi>Milk</hi> for the <hi>Babes,</hi> whilst
he sets <hi>stronger Meat</hi> before the <hi>men;</hi> Those who are <hi>Spiritual,</hi>
and by being so, are able <hi>spiritually to discern spiritual things,</hi>
to <hi>compare them with themselves,</hi> and to feed <hi>on them</hi> not only
as they are brought down to us in <hi>fleshly Images,</hi> and <hi>resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi>
But as they express and manifest themselves in us in their
own spiritual <hi>forms</hi> and glories. Sure I am if thou art truly come
within the compass of the <hi>lowest</hi> of those <hi>growths</hi> before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:49838:5"/>
if thou art become so much as a <hi>little Child</hi> in Christ, if thou
hast but that <hi>genuine instinct,</hi> and <hi>naturalness</hi> of Soul towards
God and all Divine things, which is essential to, and inseparable
from the <hi>New birth</hi> in its most <hi>infant state,</hi> if thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hast but the
least degree. of a <hi>Spiritual mind,</hi> any spiritual <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>savour,</hi>
there are a great many things in <hi>this Book</hi> which thy Soul must of
necessity <hi>understand, eccho</hi> to, rellish, and <hi>acknowledge</hi> to be
exceeeding <hi>good.</hi> Let then the <hi>goodness</hi> of what thou dost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
encourage thy <hi>Charity</hi> to think that which is above thy
reach, may be <hi>better;</hi> At least let <hi>it</hi> prevail with thy <hi>reason</hi> not
to <hi>judge, sentence,</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> it.</p>
            <p>It is every where esteemed an high and difficult <hi>Office</hi> to be a
<hi>Judge</hi> in the Affairs of this lower World. The Wisdom of our
Nation has provided (as a Noble Author observes) that so great
a <hi>Work</hi> should not depend upon <hi>One</hi> Person, every <hi>Court</hi> of Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
having a certain number of <hi>Judges</hi> or <hi>Assistants</hi> belonging
to it. Nor can a Iudge depute his Authority to another, it being
an Office and Work of greatest Confidence, Trust and Skill, and
therefore <hi>personal</hi> and <hi>inherent.</hi> And with what wariness and
caution do the <hi>Rules</hi> of all our Courts direct their own proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a <hi>Judgment</hi> in every little case here below. It is certainly
a much higher and harder work to be a Iudge in the matters of
another World, in things not obvious to <hi>Sense,</hi> and transcendent
to <hi>Reason,</hi> in things above all the natural Principles of Wisdom
or Truth in any creature: The <hi>Jews</hi> speak of it as one of the <hi>first</hi>
things delivered by God to <hi>Moses,</hi> by him to <hi>Joshua,</hi> and so
down to all their Elders and Wise men in all Ages, <hi>To be slow in
judging.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> cautions us, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 5. To judge nothing
before the time, until the Lord come.</hi> To pass a Iudgment, to
pronounee a Sentence upon <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> in spiritual
matters, is in its own nature, and in the consequences thereof, the
greatest, the weightiest act our Souls can put forth; and therefore
not to be <hi>hastily</hi> executed; nor indeed <hi>at all,</hi> without <hi>his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi>
from whom all the <hi>Authority, Power</hi> and <hi>Capacity</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Iudgment is derived. God has committed all this Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a more especial manner to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and there can be
<pb facs="tcp:49838:5"/>
no true, right, authentick, valid, and final Iudgment, <hi>without
him,</hi> and where he is not <hi>present.</hi> He has no where so deputed
this Office and Work to any <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Company</hi> of persons, as to
<hi>alienate</hi> the dignity and glory of it from himself. And whether
he dispence it <hi>immediately</hi> or <hi>mediately,</hi> he cannot be excluded.
It is his Presence, and Power, the Appearances of Christ, and
the manifestations of his Spirit, which do give to any Society of
men the Distinction and Authority of a Church; to every Church
or Person, the right, the ability of Spiritual Iudgment. No man,
no Church has here any other Spiritual Power and Capacity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit</hi> in them. And how rich, full and
sufficient soever the several Churches of Christ may at this day
esteem themselves to be without him; yet sure I am, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more speaks the absence of Christ, and his spirit; And their
poverty, emptiness, and weakness, then that <hi>hasty, rash, sleight,
partial, blind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>bold</hi> judging and censuring one another which
every where abounds in the present Christian Churches: Whilst <hi>in
some of them,</hi> the greatest acts of spiritual judgment that can be
done on Earth, (<hi>as a great man long since complained,</hi>) are
made to <hi>lackey</hi> up and down for <hi>Fees,</hi> and become the most <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
process</hi> that is. And <hi>in others</hi> which pretend to be more refin'd,
to <hi>attend</hi> upon <hi>outward forms, inward Opinions,</hi> our own <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
interests,</hi> and <hi>passions.</hi> As if instead of <hi>judging nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time, until the Lord comes;</hi> The Spirit of man would so
determine every thing, that no <hi>knot</hi> should be left for him to <hi>unty,</hi>
nothing remain for him to judge. But blessed be God <hi>the cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
curse shall not come.</hi> All the judgments which are fondly
and proudly made in <hi>mans day</hi> shall be <hi>cancell'd</hi> in the <hi>day of
Christ. Your Brethren</hi> (as God speaks by the <hi>evangelical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
to those that tremble at his Word) <hi>That hated you, that
cast you out for my name sake, said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let the Lord be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
But he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be perswaded then to <hi>do</hi> as God has <hi>done:</hi> Leave all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the <hi>Son,</hi> to his <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>measure</hi> of appearing
in thee. Wait still for his coming who is to set judgment in the
<pb facs="tcp:49838:6"/>
Earth, to bring it forth in thy Spirit. Be first able to say,
Thou art <hi>full of Power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of
Judgment,</hi> before thou takest upon thee to declare unto thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
their transgressions, mistakes, follies, and errours. Do not
venture to step into the Throne of Iudicature, till he, whose place
it is, lead thee up, lest thou find thy self ere thou art aware, in
the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Scorners,</hi> instead of the <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>Judgment. Judge
nothing till Christ comes,</hi> lest thou shouldest then be judged by
him, as an <hi>evil doer,</hi> and a <hi>busie body.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Spiritual
Man</hi> is said to <hi>judge all things.</hi> But that <hi>Word,</hi> that <hi>State,</hi> that
<hi>Work,</hi> do all of them import a <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>critical discerning</hi> of
things: such must thine be of all things before they can be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judg'd by thee. Thou mayest indeed speak evil of what thou
knowest not, but thou canst not <hi>fairly</hi> judge it, till thou doest tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
understand it. As a spiritual man read these following
Discourses, and as such give thy judgment of them. Remember
still, that every Truth is not spoken at <hi>once</hi> to every good man,
nor any Truth opened to him in its full glory at the <hi>first sight;</hi>
but as <hi>Luther</hi> speaks, we are enlightened by <hi>Beam after Beam.</hi>
It is said of some things <hi>our Saviour</hi> did, and which were done
unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12 That <hi>his Disciples understood them not at the
first, but when Christ was glorified,</hi> when he took away his flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
presence, and came in more spirit, <hi>then they were acquainted
with them. What I do,</hi> says <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Peter, Joh. 13. 7. thou
knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter,</hi> And in <hi>Joh.</hi>
16. 12, 13. He tells his Disciples, <hi>he had yet many things to
say unto them, but they could not bear them then;</hi> howbeit,
<hi>when the Spirit of Truth was come, he should guide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all Truth.</hi> When St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a little beforehand caught up
into the World to come, the Text says, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. that he <hi>heard
unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter;</hi>
that <hi>could not,</hi> that <hi>might not</hi> be spoken. Such things as would no

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ave offended the best men then alive, if he had declared
them. Good Souls have their several Orbs and Sphears of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Light and Life; all <hi>below</hi> are comprehended by them
<hi>above,</hi> and lie in their Bosoms; but the <hi>lesser Circle</hi> can by no
<pb facs="tcp:49838:6"/>
means <hi>contain</hi> the <hi>greater.</hi> A Soul got no further than the <hi>first
Heavens,</hi> cannot <hi>hear,</hi> cannot <hi>receive</hi> the discoveries and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
of <hi>one</hi> in the <hi>third.</hi> If a Truth be very <hi>raised</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi>
it is not the <hi>first Beam of Christ himself</hi> can shew us
that Truth: And if I by my glimmering light shall go about to
examine and judge things spoken in a clearer day, I shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to many mistakes, and in great danger of rejecting the
Truth, because I do not understand it. <hi>In my Father's house,</hi>
saies Christ, <hi>are many Mansions.</hi> 'Tis true of his <hi>house</hi> of <hi>grace</hi>
here <hi>below;</hi> as well as <hi>that</hi> of <hi>glory above.</hi> Let every Christian
then say of his present <hi>state</hi> and <hi>measure,</hi> This is my <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Heaven,</hi> my <hi>present Mansion;</hi> here my God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to meet me, thus he dispenseth himself to me; here I
will wait, until I am called up higher; and if another comes
and speaks things beyond my present understanding and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
I will judge no man's <hi>Light, Life</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> in
the Lord; being constant to this, that as <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>flesh</hi>
came to his <hi>own,</hi> and his <hi>own</hi> received him not; so also may
Christ in the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Instead then of judging and censuring what
thou do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st not yet understand, be faithful to that which thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
knowest; answer thy present light with a suitable life, so
shalt thou <hi>grow up,</hi> not only into all the <hi>Discoveries, Truth</hi>
and <hi>Mysteries</hi> which are in <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>all other</hi> spiritual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ooks,
but <hi>into him</hi> also <hi>in all things who is thy Head.</hi> Hast thou
received any one <hi>ray,</hi> any one <hi>glimpse</hi> of spiritual Light into thy
Soul, <hi>watch</hi> it, <hi>cherish</hi> it, <hi>walk</hi> according to the <hi>direction</hi> and
<hi>instinct</hi> of it; and <hi>this Beam</hi> shall quickly, swiftly grow up into
a <hi>glorious day</hi> in thy spirit. For, <hi>the path of the Just is as the
shining Light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> It is possible thou mayest here meet with some few
things very different from some of thy beloved Sentiments; for
our <hi>Author</hi> intended in these Discourses, to tell thee his <hi>own
thoughts,</hi> not to guess at <hi>thine.</hi> My <hi>Requests</hi> in this case, are
such as these; not <hi>to make thy self overwise;</hi> not <hi>to think
thou knowest any thing;</hi> not <hi>to abound in thy own sense;</hi> not
to lay <hi>too much</hi> weight upon thy own Iudgment, nor too little
<pb facs="tcp:49838:7"/>
upon thy Brother's; not to <hi>overvalue</hi> thy own Notions and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
nor to <hi>undervalue</hi> his; not to forget that <hi>modesty</hi> and
<hi>sobriety</hi> of mind which every good man ought still to preserve to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
himself; nor that <hi>moderation, forbearance, indulgence,
allowance</hi> and <hi>respect</hi> which not only <hi>charity,</hi> but <hi>reason</hi> and
<hi>interest</hi> oblige thee alwaies to express towards all good men
that differ from thee. For we all stand in need of, and have a
right to such a <hi>tender behaviour</hi> from one another. To impress
a little such Requests as these upon thy mind, let me briefly offer
to thy larger thoughts upon them, these few Considerations.</p>
            <p>1. It is possible for us then to have <hi>wrong</hi> Notions and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of Spiritual Truth, when we think we have the <hi>rightest.</hi>
How easily do we mistake an <hi>Object,</hi> and the <hi>true colour</hi> of it,
when we see it through a dyed and colour'd <hi>Medium?</hi> The Staff
that is streight in the Air, seems crooked when it is seen under
Water, through the grossness and inconstancy of that Element.
Such are all our views, our reports of Divine Truths, whilst we
take in, and give forth the Copies of them through the thick,
colour'd, and spotted Glass of our Natural Vnderstanding. Thou
confessest thy self to bee a poor fallible creature; thou bemoanest
daily thy Ignorance before the Lord, and beggest of him that thou
mayest <hi>understand thy own Errours:</hi> Be not then too hasty in
charging thy Brother with false Notions, whilst thou thy self art
not exempted from mistakes: Do not think thy self an Infallible
Iudge of his Errours, whilst thou art but a Fallible Discerner of
Truth for thy self.</p>
            <p>2. It is impossible for us to have <hi>clear</hi> Notions and Opinions
of Spiritual Truth, whilst we are in this <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>distant</hi> World.
<hi>We now see but through a Glass darkly.</hi> We are in a <hi>confused
state.</hi> We can better make a shift to puzzle and perplex the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>another.</hi> than we know how to disintangle and extricate
our <hi>own.</hi> The Sun appears not to us in his true brightness and
glory, but as a red bunning fire, when we see him in the mornings
and evenings through those earthly vapours and mists which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose.
Such Fogs are still gathering between the God of Truth
and our Vnderstandings, whilest they dwell below. We are as yet
<pb facs="tcp:49838:7"/>
but like the <hi>blind man</hi> in the Gospel, who upon the first touching
of his Eyes, saw <hi>Men</hi> like <hi>Trees.</hi> How fond and obstinate should
we think that man, who going forth in the <hi>twilight,</hi> when it is
impossible clearly to discover and distinguish any thing, is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
very confident he sees, and reports all things <hi>aright?</hi> All
our Notions of Spiritual Truths here below, are at best but as a
<hi>Twilight,</hi> in which <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness</hi> meet. How unreasonable
is it whilst thy own Light is shaded with so much Darkness, to
think there is no mixture of Light in thy Brother's Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</p>
            <p>3. It is impossible for us to have <hi>full</hi> and <hi>comprehensive</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Opinions of Spiritual Truth, whilst we are in this <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi>
and <hi>divided</hi> state. Our knowledge here below is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>dark</hi> (as was said before) but <hi>partial.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> with excellent
reason puts these two together, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 12. We now see
through a Glass darkly; we know but in part;</hi> or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>in division.</hi>
It is indeed the <hi>partiality</hi> of our knowledge, which causes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases
the <hi>darkness</hi> and <hi>difficulty</hi> of it, and turns it into a
<hi>Riddle. That</hi> will be plain, easie, and pleasant to us, when we
come at <hi>once</hi> to see the whole body of Divine Truth; when we
shall in <hi>one view</hi> behold the entire frame, and universal harmony
of it; the connexion, proportion, consent and sympathy of <hi>one</hi>
Truth with <hi>another,</hi> and of <hi>each</hi> Truth with <hi>every</hi> Truth; which
being now seen <hi>alone,</hi> puzzles, perplexes, intangles, and labyrinths
us. Spiritual Truths are now <hi>Aenigma</hi>'s to us, because we know
but in <hi>part,</hi> in <hi>division.</hi> All our Notions and Opinions here can
be but broken things, but little pieces of Truth. We are all run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away with scattered bits and scraps of Spiritual Truth; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one fondly calling his own <hi>share</hi> the <hi>entire Purchase:</hi> But we
know not how to put things together. <hi>Some</hi> are zealous for <hi>one;
others</hi> for <hi>another</hi> part of Divine Truth; whilst we contend for
<hi>one,</hi> we are apt to let go <hi>another;</hi> whilst we are seeking after
<hi>one,</hi> we lose <hi>another:</hi> We continually mistake one another, and
the Truth in each other, through our partial discovery of things:
We have so much light, so much knowledge, as through the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and ignorance mingled with it, and prevailing over it, serves
<pb facs="tcp:49838:8"/>
us to wrangle, dispute, and quarrel with our Brethren; but not
enough to receive and comprehend them. We have indeed a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Indivisibility</hi> of Truth, and are sure of it in the <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
but we know not how to make it out in our <hi>practice.</hi> It is
true, that is not Truth which cannot dwell with <hi>any,</hi> with every
Truth; but all Truth is not yet thus reconciled in the head of
any Good man on Earth, although it be so in every Good man's
heart; he is in love with all Truth, but has not yet found out
all its Alliances, the whole compass and circle of it. Truth is
<hi>one</hi> in it self, but it is broken into I know not how many <hi>pieces</hi>
as it is in us; and those pieces through the darkness mixt with
them in our spirits, fighting one against another. The next
state will give us a clear and comprehensive view of things; all
the divisions of <hi>Truths</hi> and of <hi>Spirits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> will then be at an end.
Those Truths, those Spirits shall then be reconciled, and run into
the Embraces of one another, that seem now to stand at the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
distance and defiance: Then the Darkness shall no more
predominate over the Light, nor employ it thus unnaturally to
contend against it self; but the Light running together from all
parts, and every where mingling with it self, shall swallow up
all the Darkness. But we have now only a glimmering prospect
of this happiness. It is impossible to attain here to a full view of
the whole face of Truth, which is <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> as <hi>God.</hi> All
our present Notions and Opinions are too narrow, too contracted to
take in those innumerable Raies and Beams of Divine Truth,
which are every where scattered and dispersed among all the
Children of Light. Thou hast but one little part of it in all thy
Notions and Opinions; thy Brother has another part in his.
Instead of undervaluing <hi>his</hi> share, it becomes us much better to
acknowledge the shortness of our <hi>own;</hi> and to say of <hi>God</hi> (with
<hi>Job</hi> upon another occasion not much different) <hi>Job 26. 14 Lo, these</hi>
are <hi>parts of his waies, but how little a portion is heard of him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The <hi>same</hi> Spiritual Truth may communicate it self to us
in <hi>various, different,</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> Notions and Opinions. The
whole state of things all along throughout the Christian World, is a
sufficient proof of this matter. It is somewhere well observ'd by
<pb facs="tcp:49838:8"/>
               <hi>our Author</hi> to this purpose, as they say in Philosophy. <hi>The Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences,
and kinds of things, are unmoveable, and ever the
same;</hi> However there be an infiniteness of uncertainty and change
in the <hi>Individuals</hi> by the variety and change of outward accidents:
So if you compare one good man with all other good men in all
ages, you will every where find the <hi>same New Nature, the
same inward savour</hi> and <hi>rellish,</hi> the <hi>same Divine Principle</hi>
and <hi>God-like life</hi> in them all; Whilst the <hi>inward forms</hi> of
truth and goodness upon their understandings, and the <hi>outward
expressions</hi> of them in their conversations, and practices, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
vary and differ, from the different degrees and waies of
their light <hi>within</hi> and their educations, and customs <hi>without.</hi> The
<hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, Rom. 14. <hi>One</hi> Christian <hi>believeth that he may
eat all things: Another who is weak eateth herbs. Let not him
that eateth despise him that eateth not; And let not him which
eateth not, judge him which eateth: For God hath received him.
One man esteemeth one day above another: Another esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
every day alike. Let every man be fully assured in his own
mind. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord;
And he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not
regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth
God thanks; And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth
not, and giveth God thanks.</hi> Both these are different, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in their Notions, Opinions, and practices; And yet in that
difference, and contrariety, do both serve the same Lord, and
are accepted by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They both in their several opinions, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and practices, have the same apprehensions of the glory of
God, the same reference and regard to it, the same aim and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Soul to make themselves a Spiritual sacrifice to him. Nor
does this hold only in the <hi>lesser</hi> matters of Religion, but in the
<hi>greater</hi> also. Besides that <hi>Babel</hi> and confusion of languages, that
variety and contrariety of opinions which are in the Christian
World, about things of a lower consideration; What disputes,
what controversies, what contradictions, do we see at this day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
good men concerning the most substantial, and vital truths of
the Gospel? How even among the best Christians themselves, are
<pb facs="tcp:49838:9"/>
some of the greatest points of Christianity, darkened and perplexed
with Clouds of disputes, with diversity, and uncertainty of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with different and contrary explications? What Principle
of Christianity (how clearly and expresly soever it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to us in the letter of the Scriptures) has been universally
received and explained alike by all good men? Do we not every
where see those very Persons, who have (as we have reason to
judge) entertained the same Divine Truths in the inward power,
life, and Spirit of them, do yet discourse, interpret, and preach them
in Notions, Opinions, and Forms, very different and contrary to one
another? Do we not every where see good men puzling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
each other with their own explanations of those very
things, in the life and power of which they are all agreed? Have
we not upon this accompt seen some of the best of men such stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to, and so jealous of one another, that they have been unable to
bear one another. Look abroad, lay aside all thy prejudice, fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and partiality; And then tell me if thou dost not every where
meet with the same <hi>ingenuity, modesty, humility,</hi> and <hi>meekness</hi>
of Soul; The same <hi>desire</hi> and diligence in the search after truth;
the same <hi>goodness, holiness</hi> of <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life;</hi> The same <hi>Love</hi> to
God, and his waies; the same <hi>sincerity,</hi> and <hi>integrity,</hi> the same
<hi>purity</hi> of <hi>intention, aim</hi> and <hi>end;</hi> in <hi>persons</hi> that appear to
thee, and to one another, of very different, and contrary minds,
and practices, in matters of Religion. Their Souls are vitally
quickened, and informed, their conversations beautified, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned,
with the same Spiritual truths; Which by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
of them, they seem not to <hi>understand,</hi> yea to <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have some where read a story of a <hi>blind man</hi> who could distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
and judge of all metals, or pretious stones, by <hi>weighing</hi> them
in his hand. I am perswaded if we had learn thus to judge of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
things, not by the <hi>beauty</hi> of some outward form and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or an <hi>agreeableness</hi> to our own Notions and Opinions; But
by the <hi>weight</hi> of an inward Principle, and the Power of a Divine
life; We should discover a most harmonious agreement in the
<hi>Essential</hi> and <hi>radical</hi> Principles of Divine <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb facs="tcp:49838:9"/>
those who seem most of all to oppose one another, in their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Opinions. If we did but know how to <hi>get into,</hi> to <hi>open,</hi> and
<hi>interpret</hi> each others Souls; How to weigh not only <hi>words,</hi> and
<hi>phrases,</hi> but <hi>Spirits,</hi> as God is said to do, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 2. We should
quickly find, that we differ more in <hi>words,</hi> then in <hi>thoughts,</hi> and
in the <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>things,</hi> then in the <hi>things themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Spiritual <hi>wisdom, holiness, strength,</hi> and <hi>happiness,</hi> do
not lye in our Notions, and Opinions of Spiritual truth, but in the
truth itself. St. <hi>Paul</hi> excellently distinguishes, and explains this
matter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6, 7. Where speaking of the <hi>light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,</hi> he tells
us, <hi>we have this treasure in Earthen Vessels, that the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the power may be of God, and not of us. That Spiritual
truth</hi> which is the shining forth of the glory of God in the <hi>Person</hi>
of Christ, the <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>supream,</hi> the <hi>universal truth,</hi> is the <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
treasure;</hi> The <hi>several Notions,</hi> and <hi>forms</hi> in our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
by which this truth appears to us, are but a part of the <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Vessel</hi> which holds this <hi>treasure.</hi> How weak is it, to lay the
<hi>weight</hi> of such a <hi>treasure,</hi> upon such a <hi>Vessel,</hi> subject to so many
frailties, flaws, and cracks? How unworthy is it, to ascribe the
excellency of <hi>that power</hi> to our <hi>selves,</hi> which belongs wholly to
<hi>God?</hi> Sure I am, it is not the <hi>Vessel</hi> that makes us <hi>rich,</hi> but the
<hi>treasure</hi> which is in the <hi>Vessel.</hi> Thus again, The same <hi>Apostle</hi>
speaking of the same thing in another expression, tells us, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 20.
The Kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</hi> This King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
consists not in the excellency of our notions and apprehensions,
of our <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>expressions</hi> concerning Spiritual things; But
in the inward <hi>Vertue, Vigour, Life, Power,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> that is in
the Nature of them, to change the whole man into one image of glory
with themselves. Spiritual knowledge is not a <hi>notional, verbal,</hi>
and <hi>talking;</hi> but a <hi>real<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> living,</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> thing. Divine truth
is better understood, as it opens and unfolds itself in the <hi>holy,</hi> and
<hi>heavenly mind,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of a good man, then by all the <hi>Systems</hi> of
Divinity, and <hi>good Books</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>Thy <hi>Brother</hi> has (it may be) several Notions and opinions of
Spiritual Truth, very different from thine; But he is really <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb facs="tcp:49838:10"/>
through the same truth; He has purified his Soul in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the truth through the Spirit.</hi> He is become a <hi>living Edition</hi>
of the truth, it is <hi>written</hi> in his <hi>heart,</hi> it <hi>shines forth</hi> in his <hi>life,</hi>
he has <hi>so learned the truth,</hi> that <hi>he knows it as it is</hi> in <hi>Jesus;</hi>
although he cannot yet receive it, <hi>as it is in thee,</hi> nor thy notions
and representations of it. His <hi>Soul,</hi> his <hi>life,</hi> is <hi>dyed, coloured</hi>
and <hi>figured</hi> with it; the truth is transforming his whole being
into one beautiful and blessed image <hi>with,</hi> framing, fashioning,
his whole man <hi>according to,</hi> itself. This must needs be a better
proof that he is truly <hi>one</hi> with thee in the same truth, then the
highest complement he can pay to thy own notions and Opinions
concerning it, can possibly be; <hi>Holiness</hi> is the <hi>Character,</hi> and <hi>seal</hi>
of the Spirit of Truth. The result of this consideration is plainly
this, That we should not lay too great a stress upon our own notions
and Opinions, nor despise our Brothers; That we should make the
<hi>image of God.</hi> and not our <hi>own likeness,</hi> the <hi>reason, rule,</hi> and
<hi>measure</hi> of our Brotherly Love; Observing still in all our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
converses, that excellent <hi>League</hi> which our <hi>Saviour himself</hi>
has established. <hi>He that is not against us, is with us.</hi> Whilst we
see the same truth vitally influencing, and quickening the <hi>Souls</hi>
and spreading itself throughout the <hi>lives</hi> of good men of different
and contrary sentiments, let us no longer judge another by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primising
with our own sense of things, but his agreement with us
in the substance, power, efficacy, and Spirit of the truth.</p>
            <p>Thus the primitive Christians judged, before the iniquity of
the times, and a worldly interest corrupted the simplicity, and
quenched the first and purer warmths of Religion. No man was
then censured for his Opinion, that <hi>lived well,</hi> although there
were very strange notions then commenced. So much and so justly
did those better ages of Christianity, prefer a <hi>God like life,</hi> to
the <hi>rightest notions</hi> and <hi>Opinions.</hi> Nor did they want the
highest Example, Authority, and Reason in this matter, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
having told them, and us. <hi>He is no respecter of Persons,
but in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is accepted with him, Act.</hi> 10. 34. And again, Rom. 14.
17. <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and Drink, but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<pb facs="tcp:49838:10"/>
and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, and he that in
these things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of men:</hi> That is, shall be justified in the day of all <hi>Divine,</hi> and
<hi>humane Principles.</hi> Whatever his <hi>outward form,</hi> or <hi>inward O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi>
be; Whether he eat, or eat not; Keep a day, or keep it
not; So it be to the <hi>Lord,</hi> to <hi>Charity,</hi> and to Aedification.</p>
            <p>5. All the truest and best notions, and Opinions we can have
of Spiritual truth here <hi>below,</hi> are to be <hi>done away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
at that state <hi>above,</hi> So the <hi>Apostle</hi> expresly tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.
13. 9. 10. We know in part, and we Prophesy in part.</hi> But
when that which is <hi>perfect is come, then that which is in part
shall be done away.</hi> We shall <hi>then</hi> lose all our present Notions
and Opinions of Spiritual things, not in a blackness of Darkness
and Death, violently breaking in upon, and overspreading them;
But in the brightness of an unmixt, and eternal light arising upon,
and comprehending them in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>self. They shall all be blotted out,
not as water quenches the fire; But after such a manner as the
Beams of the Sun do <hi>put</hi> it out, by drawing up the finer, and
more fiery parts into themselves. They shall be <hi>put</hi> out, not as a
Candle is by the <hi>Extinguisher;</hi> But as the darknesses, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of the night are swallowed up by the light of the morning: Or
rather, as the several colours of light in the first dawning of the
day, are afterwards drunk up into the pure and perfect light of the
encreasing day. It is yet but a morning light with the most enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Souls here on Earth. In the first breaking of the day, the
Light (you know) appears to us in a variety of colours, one after
another; Till at last as the day comes on, all those colours are
changed into an unstained and pure light. Such are the discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Spiritual things to our understandings, whilst our <hi>true day</hi> is
yet but <hi>Springing.</hi> All our Notions and Opinions of them are as
so many colours of light, growing clearer and clearer, unto a Noon
day brightness. Now all these colours vanish; Now all our mistaken,
dark, mixt, short, and disproportioned notions and apprehensions,
break up into a light which has nothing of privation, mixture, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection,
or shadow in it. But till then it is impossible for us, to have
such Notions &amp; Opinions of Spiritual truth as can admit of no change,
<pb facs="tcp:49838:11"/>
or emprovement. We are here in a <hi>growing &amp;</hi> travelling state. And
whilst we are so, motion is better then rest. We can now no more
stint, and fix our sense of things, then we can hinder and stop our
own growth; Or keep day out of the World, when the Sun arises.
It is not here, our <hi>reproach,</hi> but our <hi>praise,</hi> to be still changing our
minds, to be still <hi>transformed in the renewing of them,</hi> that <hi>we
may prove what the good and acceptable will of God is.</hi> To
change for emprovement, to alter our minds for the better, is not our
<hi>inconstancy,</hi> but our <hi>virtue.</hi> This is only to change, as all things
do, when they encrease; nothing speaks us more <hi>rooted, fixt,</hi> and
<hi>established,</hi> then such a <hi>change.</hi> Thou art not (it may be) of the
same mind, at this instant, thou wert in, a few daies past, neither
dost thou know what mind thou shalt have to morrow. The <hi>spirit</hi> of
man changes Opinion every moment; And what one reason brings
in this hour, a stronger may carry out the next. Nor will the <hi>good
Spirit</hi> (if thou art indeed acted, and informed by it) suffer thee to
rest in thy present light, and much less in thy remaining darkness.
Thou art not yet so knowing, so good as thou shouldst be, if thou
canst be satisfied with thy self, and thy present Notions of things.
Art thou not waiting for Christ to <hi>touch thine Eyes a second
time?</hi> Dost thou not pray for his Spirit to lead thee into all truth?
Can'st thou be contented to lose thy share in the riches of that
glory, thou art yet a stranger to? Thou thinkest (it may be) that
thou <hi>understandest all mysteries,</hi> and hast all knowledge, but still
all thou canst attain to here below, is but a <hi>little part</hi> of what is
yet to come; And will be <hi>done away, when that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
appears.</hi> Why then dost thou lay so great a weight upon those
Notions and Opinions, which thou hadst not the other day, which
thou mayst lose to morrow, and which are finally to be swallowed
up? Why should an obscure, dark, intricate, curious, unnecessary,
uncertain, and fading Notion and Opinion, be imploy'd to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of that <hi>Charity</hi> that shall never fail? All our Notions and
Opinions are <hi>changeable, temporary, transient,</hi> and <hi>perishing</hi>
things; They pass away, and confute themselves, whilst we are
contending for them. but <hi>Love</hi> is a <hi>lasting, permanent,</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Duty,</hi> and <hi>perfection.</hi> This shall remain, when all our Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:49838:11"/>
and Opinions of one sort and another, shall for ever cease to be;
Shall either <hi>sink down</hi> into their <hi>first darkness</hi> out of which they
sprung; Or <hi>rise up</hi> into, and happily <hi>lose</hi> themselves in their
<hi>Original Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Let us seriously consider how <hi>mischievous</hi> the want of that
<hi>moderation,</hi> I am pleading for, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>has all along been to Christians
and to <hi>Christianity</hi> it self. What depths of <hi>inward filthinesses</hi>
have the <hi>differences</hi> and <hi>animosities</hi> of good men about Opinions,
discovered <hi>in them,</hi> and drawn forth <hi>from them?</hi> What floods of
<hi>outward</hi> miseries have they brought <hi>upon them?</hi> It is this has
given such a scope, and power to our lusts, to our pride, ambition,
covetousness, anger, wrath, bitterness of Spirit and revenge, as has
been more <hi>wounding</hi> to Religion, then the malice of all the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men in the World can possibly be. It is <hi>this</hi> has set us to rake
into the Infirmities, Weaknesses, and Miscarriage of our <hi>mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Brother;</hi> And whilst men have been thus employed, what
heaps of dirt, and folly have they poured out of their <hi>own Spirits,</hi>
to the greater scandal of <hi>themselves,</hi> and their <hi>profession?</hi> It is
<hi>this,</hi> has for several ages delivered up the Christian World to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
bloud, and desolation. It is <hi>this,</hi> has rendred a great part
of <hi>it unhabitable</hi> to a man that asserts the just liberty of his
mind. It is <hi>this</hi> has made <hi>Christians</hi> (who should be the best of
men) much worse to each other, than <hi>wild Bears</hi> and <hi>Beasts of
prey,</hi> for they devour not one another of the same kind. It is <hi>this</hi>
has raised so many suspitions, jealousies, fears, heart-burnings,
evil surmises, mutual provocations to wrath, and thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
and ruine, among our selves, that we are almost become an
<hi>easy prey</hi> to our common enemies; And if we should escape <hi>them,</hi>
are in danger to be <hi>consumed one of another.</hi> We have laid the
stress, and weight of our Religion upon Notions, Opinions, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
modes and forms, and some of those subservient only to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
interest, and <hi>reasons of state,</hi> and not upon the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
it self, which is <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>his Spirit.</hi> For this
reason the Righteous God seems to have given up the whole frame
of Nature to confusion and destruction, and to be drowning the face
of the Earth in bloud.</p>

Saints. Lines</hi> are at their greatest distance in the <hi>circumference;</hi>
the <hi>nearer</hi> they come to their <hi>center,</hi> the <hi>nearer</hi> still they are to

his <hi>Person</hi> alone, so shall we also draw near <hi>to,</hi> and be at peace <hi>with</hi>
one another. It is he alone who is our <hi>King of Righteousness, and
Prince of Peace, the true Shiloe.</hi> Vnto him shall the <hi>gathering</hi>
of the People be, and unto each other in him. Nothing more proves

cry out with an universal shout, <hi>None but Christ,</hi> he alone is
that <hi>eternal image</hi> it self of all <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi> which
we have been every where seeking, our <hi>center</hi> and <hi>rest</hi> for ever:
When we shall no more place our wisdom, righteousness, sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and redemption, our <hi>Religion</hi> in those forms and Opinions,
which are but the outsides, and dresses of <hi>it,</hi> and must <hi>pass away
with the fashion of this World;</hi> Which are but the leaves and
husks that shall fall to the ground; But <hi>in him</hi> who is that Truth,
Life, Power, and Substance which <hi>endures for ever. Then shall a
peace which is to encrease without end, bless the World; All
our Swords shall then be beaten into Plow shares, our spears
turned into pruning-hooks, and nothing be left to hurt, and
destroy in Gods holy Mountain.</hi>

            <p>A mutual forbearance, indulgence, allowance, and kindness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

and outward forms; But an <hi>Unity</hi> of Spirit; an <hi>Unity</hi>
in <hi>that Spirit,</hi> which is the common Soul of the Church, the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificating
form, the constituting and conserving Principle of all
true Christianity. We are not united to <hi>Christ,</hi> and to <hi>one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
by the same Opinions, and Forms; but by one and the same
Spirit, nor can any Opinions and Forms divide us from Christ, (and
therefore ought not to separate us from each other) if they have
not in their own nature an <hi>enmity</hi> to the <hi>heavenly image</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi> which is <hi>Spirituality;</hi> Or to the <hi>natural image</hi> of <hi>him</hi>
which is <hi>morality.</hi> It is <hi>again</hi> expresly told us in the <hi>connexion</hi>

one another in love;</hi> And not by a <hi>proud, haughty, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,

of Religion upon them. This may indeed be a mistaken piece of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone
policy to serve our own Worldly interest upon Christianity;
but I am very sure, there is nothing of the true Spirit of Christ in
this temper, not of a right endeavouring to keep the Vnity of his
Spirit in such a proceeding.</p>
            <p>How clear is it <hi>again</hi> from this Scripture. That the <hi>bond of
Peace</hi> has its <hi>strength,</hi> and <hi>root,</hi> not in an <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>knowledge</hi>
and <hi>uniformity</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> but in the <hi>Unity</hi> of a <hi>Divine Spirit;</hi>

good men. Whilst we are thus circumstanced, there will be some <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
minded;</hi> Nor do I know any remedy in such a case, but
a <hi>mutual forbearance,</hi> till <hi>God cleares</hi> up the <hi>matter of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
This <hi>forbearance</hi> cannot be more our <hi>Duty,</hi> then it is our
<hi>interest,</hi> and <hi>necess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity;</hi> for it is our <hi>preservation</hi> in the midst
of powerful lusts <hi>within,</hi> and potent Enemies <hi>without.</hi> If all good
men could but make a <hi>shift</hi> to <hi>tollerate one another,</hi> this wicked
World must be bound to <hi>endure them all.</hi> Could they but hold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
and love one another; No forreign violence could <hi>break
them. Goodness</hi> is stronger then <hi>Evil;</hi> and therefore the <hi>good</hi>
thus <hi>united,</hi> and in an <hi>Association;</hi> Must be too powerful for the
<hi>Evil,</hi> with all its <hi>Plots, Conspiracies,</hi> and <hi>Force.</hi> What a <hi>root</hi>
of mischiefs have the <hi>Divisions</hi> of good men been in all ages to
<hi>themselves.</hi> From hence we may derive all the <hi>Evils</hi> we <hi>feel,</hi>
and those also we fear. When the <hi>sheep push,</hi> and <hi>run heads</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
one another, the <hi>Shepheard</hi> saies, we shall have <hi>foul wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
We have already seen the truth of this <hi>observation,</hi> and
I am affraid must feel it once again. 'Tis easy to <hi>presage</hi> a <hi>storm</hi>
when so much <hi>ill weather</hi> appeares in the Spirits, faces, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of men. God grant it may prove but a <hi>storm,</hi> for from the
animosities that are yet between good men, and an <hi>implacableness</hi>
of Spirit which is started among us, we have cause to fear a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These <hi>Reader,</hi> are some few <hi>General considerations</hi> to impress a
little upon thy mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>that moderation</hi> which is thy <hi>Duty,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
good mans <hi>Right,</hi> how different soever his Notions, and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
may be from thine. I might now add some <hi>others,</hi> which
more <hi>particularly</hi> relate to our <hi>excellent Author,</hi> but I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
too much exceeded the bounds of my own intentions, and thy
patience; nor would I willingly depart from the Modesty of my first
Resolution, which was to do nothing in this service, that might
pretend to pass for a <hi>Preface</hi> to these <hi>following Discourses.</hi> I
<pb facs="tcp:49838:13"/>
therefore leave the <hi>Book itself</hi> to open thee its own unspeakable
worth, as thou readest it. And I perswade my self, when thou hast
duly perused it, and well observed those <hi>excellent rules</hi> by which
our <hi>Author</hi> governs himself throughout these discourses; That
admirable <hi>temper,</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> That pleasant, and powerful <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi>
to <hi>holiness,</hi> and <hi>spirituality,</hi> that is every where to be
found in them? Whatever thy thoughts may be concerning some of
his <hi>sentiments,</hi> thou must needs have a great love for his <hi>memory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not in the <hi>universal Nature</hi> of things a more
intimate <hi>Sympathy,</hi> then <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Gooodness;</hi> they are
really <hi>one;</hi> They are for ever <hi>inseparable;</hi> They differ only as
the <hi>seal</hi> and the <hi>stamp; Goodness</hi> being but the <hi>Impression</hi> of
<hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This consideration (I must confess) has so far prevailed with
me, that I cannot defend my self from thinking, there must be
<hi>something</hi> of <hi>truth</hi> in <hi>all</hi> our <hi>Author</hi> has here delivered to us,
whilst I find there is so much <hi>goodness</hi> in it <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now <hi>Reader,</hi> according to <hi>custom,</hi> I should spend a great
deal more of thy <hi>time</hi> in a <hi>long Apology,</hi> for having already ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up so much of <hi>it.</hi> But in my Opinion to excuse this matter, is at
once to abuse my <hi>self,</hi> and <hi>thee.</hi> For it was in my power not to have
given <hi>thee</hi> all this trouble, if for the sake at least of some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
I had not judged it reasonable so to do; and if thou thinkest
otherwise, it is still in thy power to escape as much of it as thou
pleasest. I chuse rather to take my leave of <hi>thee</hi> with <hi>this serious
Request to the,</hi> That thou wouldst read these <hi>Heavenly Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
with the same <hi>Divine Love</hi> which first brought them forth from
the <hi>fountain</hi> of all Loves. It is not by the <hi>sagacity</hi> of our own <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
understandings,</hi> but by being <hi>rooted</hi> and <hi>grounded</hi> in <hi>Love</hi>
that we come <hi>to comprehend Spiritual truths.</hi> That this <hi>Love may
abound in thee</hi> yet <hi>more and more in knowledge, and in all
judgment,</hi> or <hi>sense, that thou mayst approve things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,</hi>
Is the hearty prayer of</p>

enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the <hi>First Verse,</hi> the Disciples of our Lord measuring the State of
Things above, by the Principles of Reason, and the Fashion of this
World; make this Inquiry; <hi>Who should be Greatest in the Kingdom of
God;</hi> as if <hi>Ambition</hi> must follow us into <hi>Heaven,</hi> there also to make a <hi>Hell.</hi>
Our Savior would undeceive those, whom He lov'd, by answering not so
much to their Proposals, as their Principles. Therefore He gives them a full
<hi>Description</hi> of the Christian Mystery, which is exprest in the words of my
Text: <hi>Except ye be Converted, and become as little Children, ye cannot enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <head>This Description hath Three Parts.</head>
               <item>1. A Rise to a Kingdom.</item>
               <item>2. The Race towards it.</item>
               <item>3. The Royalty itself.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>The Rise to the Kingdom</hi> lyes in these words: <hi>Except ye be converted:</hi>
The Greek word signifies a <hi>Turn</hi> or <hi>Change</hi> from the present <hi>Principles,</hi> and
<hi>Forms</hi> of things to another <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>view.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Race to the Kingdom <hi>is thus set forth:</hi> and become as little Children:
Diminutives <hi>are signs of</hi> Affection, Delight, <hi>and</hi> Dependence; <hi>as that;</hi> One of
those little Ones, that believeth on Me: <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 6.</p>
            <p>3. The Royalty itself, <hi>is magnificently describ'd:</hi> Ye cannot enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven. The Kingdom of Heavn <hi>hath a</hi> Twofold <hi>Signification.
Sometimes it is</hi> generally <hi>taken for both States of</hi> Grace <hi>and</hi> Glory: <hi>one being
the</hi> Inchoation; <hi>the other the</hi> Consummation: <hi>Man in one, being as a King</hi> Elect:
<hi>in the other a King</hi> Crown'd. <hi>Sometimes it hath a</hi> particular <hi>sense, and points
out one peculiar State of Liberty, and Spiritual Glory; as Rom.</hi> 14. 17. The
Kingdom of God consisteth not in Meats and Drinks: but in Righteousness, Peace,
and Ioy in the Holy Ghost. <hi>So again, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 8, 11. If these things be in you,
and abound, a large entrance shall be made for you into the Kingdom of Heaven.
<hi>The</hi> Reason <hi>of the Expression in both senses is; because God is both the</hi> King
<hi>of Believers, and their</hi> Kingdom, <hi>either in</hi> Fleshly Types, <hi>or in his own</hi> Spiritual.

               <hi>These</hi> three Parts <hi>thus opened, afford us</hi> three Doctrines <hi>for our Discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The first Rise to true Religion is a Conversion or Change.</p>

of Heaven, or the Royalty begun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The first Rise to true Religion, is a Conversion or Change. <hi>This is
the</hi> first Doctrine; <hi>and I begin with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>David'<hi>s language makes it good,</hi> Psa. 51. 13. Then will I teach transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto thee. <hi>He that will pass from
the dismal Depths of sin and Woe, to those Heights of Strength, Holiness and
Sweetness in God, must make his</hi> first Motion a Conversion, <hi>a</hi> Change <hi>from a</hi>
Descent <hi>to an</hi> Ascent; <hi>from going</hi> Outward <hi>to the</hi> Circle, <hi>to go</hi> Inward <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the</hi> Center <hi>of things, which comprehends and casts forth all the</hi> Circles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Explication <hi>of the</hi> Point <hi>will be its fullest</hi> Confirmation. <hi>I will open it
in</hi> three Parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Change.</item>
               <item>2. The Circumstances.</item>
               <item>3. The Cause of this Change.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Part</hi> 1. The Change. <hi>There are</hi> two States <hi>to be considered in this</hi> Part.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The State of Man before this Change.</item>
               <item>2. The State, to which this Change is made.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. State. <hi>That of Man</hi> before this Change. <hi>Man before his</hi> Conversion
<hi>walks in a</hi> threefold Image.</p>
            <p>1. The Image of Nature. 2. The Image of the Devil. 3. The Image of Divine
Wrath.</p>
            <p>1. Image of Nature. <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>tell us,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 49. As we have born the
Image of the Earthy, we shall also bear the Image of the Heavenly Man. Earth <hi>and</hi>
Heaven <hi>are here opposed, not as</hi> Men <hi>and</hi> Angels, Visible <hi>and</hi> Invisible <hi>things;
but as the State of things</hi> in the Creature, <hi>and</hi> in Christ. <hi>So it appears mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
by the</hi> Context <hi>of that place, that the</hi> first Adam, <hi>the</hi> Earthly Man, <hi>the</hi>
first Creation, Nature <hi>in the Visible and Invisible things of it, are all the same
thing, and</hi> One Image. <hi>Into this</hi> Image <hi>Man is born of his Natural Parents. In
this he lives</hi> Naturally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> Image <hi>hath</hi> three things <hi>in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>'Tis a</hi> Representation.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>'Tis a</hi> Meer <hi>Representation.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. <hi>'Tis a</hi> Mixt <hi>One</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>The</hi> Image <hi>of</hi> Nature <hi>is a</hi> Representation. <hi>The</hi> Earthly <hi>Man is an Image
of God, as well as the</hi> Heavenly. <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>teacheth us,</hi> Rom. 5. 14. <hi>in the latter
part of it, that the</hi> first Adam is a figure of him, who is to come; <hi>that is, Jesus
Christ. Whatever</hi> Rich <hi>workings, and</hi> various <hi>forms are in him, who is the</hi>
Wisdom <hi>of God. Whatever</hi> Depth <hi>of</hi> Life. Heighth <hi>of</hi> Activity, Store <hi>of</hi> Virtues
<hi>are in him, who is the</hi> Power <hi>of God: Whatever ravishing</hi> Beauties <hi>are in
him, who is the</hi> Brightness <hi>of the Father's</hi> Glory: <hi>Whatever endless</hi> Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<hi>of</hi> Love, Loveliness, <hi>mutual</hi> Relations <hi>are in him, who is the</hi> first, <hi>the</hi> Only
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49838:15"/>
begotten <hi>of the Father; All these are</hi> figured <hi>out, and represented to us in the</hi>
Earthly Image. <hi>This is the</hi> first thing.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> is a <hi>Meer</hi> Representation: It hath a <hi>show</hi> of
things, but not the <hi>very</hi> things themselves. We read <hi>Psal. 39. 5. Man at his
best Estate is altogether vanity.</hi> Take the <hi>first</hi> Man at his <hi>Best;</hi> as he was crown'd
with the whole Quire of <hi>Angels</hi> when they were the first and freshest <hi>Rayes</hi> of
Divinity among the Creatures; as he was cloath'd with the heavenly <hi>Bodies,
Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> while yet they were the near and transparent <hi>Images</hi> of
Angels <hi>living</hi> in them; as he hath spread about his <hi>Feet,</hi> all the Delicacies of
<hi>Air, Earth</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> when they were Pure and Chrystalline, <hi>Reflections</hi> of the
heavenly <hi>Bodies:</hi> The <hi>first</hi> Man in this State was a meer <hi>Phantome,</hi> a fleeting
Fancy, a Bubble, <hi>Vanity</hi> quite thorow, and so he vanisht in his Fall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen. 1. 27. God made Man in his own Image, Psal. 39. 6. Surely Man walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in a vain show.</hi> Those two expressions; <hi>Image, vain Show,</hi> are both the
same in Hebrew, <hi>TSelem.</hi> If you translate the same word in <hi>Genesis,</hi> as it is
translated in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> you will then read thus; <hi>God made Man in a vain
show of himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you may object thus against this; If God be <hi>Omnipresent,</hi> and fill
All, how can any thing be a Representation <hi>of him, without him?</hi> He is at the
bottom of the Sea, in the shades of Death and Hell, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 8, 9, 10. Can
any thing be a <hi>meer Show,</hi> when he who is <hi>All,</hi> is <hi>every where,</hi> and <hi>fills</hi> each
Show of things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 'Tis true, as <hi>Euthydemus</hi> the Heathen taught of old; <hi>All things are
in each thing:</hi> Or as St. <hi>Paul</hi> since him hath Preacht upon clearer grounds:
God is <hi>a Fulness filling all in All, Eph.</hi> 1. 23. But this also is true, that All
things are in each thing <hi>according to the Manner</hi> of that in which they are.
God is as truly in the <hi>Froward,</hi> as in the <hi>Gentle</hi> Spirit. But we learn the <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi>
of his Presence from <hi>David, Psal. 18. 26. With the Pure thou wilt shew
thy self Pure; with the Froward thou wilt shew thy self Froward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is not only on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> but on <hi>Mount Sinai;</hi> yet so, that on <hi>Mount
Sinai</hi> he is a flame of <hi>fire;</hi> on <hi>Mount Sion</hi> a calm and clear <hi>Light.</hi> So God is
<hi>in Himself,</hi> and <hi>in the Creature: In Himself</hi> he is <hi>Himself;</hi> the Eternal <hi>Rock</hi>
and <hi>Substance</hi> of things. He is <hi>in the Creature,</hi> only as <hi>his own Shadow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Infiniteness</hi> and <hi>Unsearchableness</hi> of God. He comprehends the
thinnest <hi>Shadows in Himself,</hi> and makes them there <hi>Substantial.</hi> Again, he
casts <hi>Himself</hi> into every <hi>Shadow</hi> or <hi>Show,</hi> and <hi>Himself</hi> there becomes but <hi>sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy.</hi>
Thus he is <hi>All in All.</hi> Thus much for the <hi>second thing</hi> in the <hi>Natural
Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> is a <hi>Mixt</hi> Representation. The Making of the
World was divided into so many <hi>Parts,</hi> as <hi>Days;</hi> each <hi>Day</hi> had its <hi>Night;</hi> a
<hi>Morning</hi> and an <hi>Evening</hi> made the <hi>Day.</hi> This was to signifie that the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49838:16"/>
Constitution of this frame of things, was laid in a commixture of
<hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness.</hi> These two mutually <hi>catch</hi> and <hi>enfold</hi> one another.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Light discovers</hi> God: The <hi>Darkness obscures</hi> that Discovery; so that
<hi>seeing, we do not see.</hi> The <hi>Light pleaseth</hi> us; the <hi>Darkness perplexeth</hi> those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
so that this Life is as a <hi>Shady Valley,</hi> as a <hi>Shadow</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
and <hi>Hell</hi> both in one. The <hi>Light</hi> invites and allures us to those Immortal
Seats above, pointing out a shining Path to them. The <hi>Darkness affrights</hi> us,
and drives us back, casting a mist of <hi>Doubt</hi> upon those beautiful Beings, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
it self between them and us, as a <hi>Dreadful Gulf</hi> to be pass'd,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nature</hi> is by this means an <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Perfections,</hi> which are beyond Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but an <hi>Imperfect</hi> one. God speaks it, <hi>Isa. 55. 9. As the Heavens are
higher than the Earth; so are my waies higher than your waies, and my thoughts
than your thoughts.</hi> The <hi>waies</hi> of God are the unchang'd workings of Glory,
perpetually casting it self into all Changes in the Divine Nature. The <hi>Thoughts</hi>
of God are the deepest <hi>Roots,</hi> the most spatious <hi>Expansion</hi> and <hi>Putting forth,</hi> the
fixt and glorious <hi>Platforms</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> of things, in the Godhead. The <hi>Waies</hi>
and <hi>Thoughts</hi> of Man, are the <hi>figurings</hi> of things in <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>according to the
Forms</hi> of Nature. This is a certain Rule: The <hi>first</hi> thing in every kind is the
<hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Substance;</hi> all <hi>second things</hi> are <hi>Images</hi> of that. The <hi>first thoughts</hi>
and <hi>waies</hi> are those in God. The <hi>Waies</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Thoughts</hi> in <hi>Man,</hi> are
<hi>second</hi> to those, and so <hi>Images</hi> of them; but with as vast a <hi>Difference,</hi> as the
<hi>Distance</hi> is between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> Thus <hi>Imperfect</hi> and <hi>Mixt</hi> is <hi>Nature,</hi>
yet an <hi>Image</hi> of Divine Perfections and Purity.</p>
            <p>We have now taken a view of the <hi>first Image,</hi> in which Man walks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his <hi>Change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use 1. Excitation.</hi> The <hi>first Use</hi> is to awaken in us a <hi>Sense</hi> of our <hi>State,</hi> as
we are <hi>Men.</hi> This would very advantagiously direct, sweeten, assist our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</hi>
Let us then to this end consider these <hi>four Questions.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What we are.</item>
               <item>2. Where we are.</item>
               <item>3. Whence we come.</item>
               <item>4. How we came hither.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. What are we? David <hi>answers for us,</hi> Psal. 39. 6. Surely Man
walketh in a vain show, and disquieteth himself in vain. <hi>Man is a</hi> Shadowy
Show. Descend <hi>O Man! into thine own Being: Enter into the secretest Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of thine own Spirit; there sit, look round about thee and say,</hi> Can I
comprehend my self? Can I tell into what f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Vain Main! why dost thou exalt thy self by Pride, as if thou wert <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
seeing thou art not the <hi>Beauty,</hi> but the <hi>Face</hi> in the <hi>Glass;</hi> too <hi>slight</hi> a
thing for thy self to <hi>take hold</hi> of; too weak a thing to <hi>reflect</hi> upon it self?</p>
            <p>Foolish Man! What dost thou, feeding upon thy Spirit such a numerous
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49838:16"/>
flock of <hi>Cares, Contrivances, Confidence, Plots</hi> and <hi>Passions?</hi> Hast thou no sense
of this, that, <hi>it is not in Man, that walks, to guide his own steps?</hi> There is
some <hi>Eternal thing</hi> above thy reach, past thy understanding, which <hi>fashions</hi> thee,
and <hi>carries</hi> thee on in <hi>its own Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Look upward then, and say,</hi> O thou hidden and supreme Substance! which
hast cast me, as thy Shadow, upon this Earth; comprehend me. O thou supreme
Pattern! which hast sent me forth to pass thorow this world in thy Image;
Guide me.</p>
            <p>Q. 2. <hi>Where are we?</hi> I shall give a twofold Answer to this Question.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We are <hi>in a world of Images.</hi> This world is a <hi>Type</hi> of God, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that some Heathens call'd the world, the <hi>Great God. Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
lifts up her voice, and cryes in the corner of every street. Wisdom</hi> is the
<hi>Brightness</hi> of <hi>Eternal Beauties;</hi> the <hi>Streets</hi> are the <hi>Outward Forms,</hi> on which
all the Creatures walk forth; the <hi>Corner</hi> or <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Street</hi> is the <hi>Power</hi> or
<hi>Principle</hi> in these Forms thorow which, as by several <hi>Tongues of Fire,</hi> the
<hi>Forms above</hi> sparkle and proclaim themselves. <hi>Their sound,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, is
gone forth into the whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Canst thou sleep, be slothful or sad here? <hi>Hear</hi> and <hi>see.</hi> O Man! thou art
in this world, as <hi>at a Show.</hi> A <hi>Noise</hi> of Diving Glories descending thorow the
Clouds: <hi>Apparitions</hi> of heavenly Essences, or Excellencies coming forth sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed;
these fill the empty space. A <hi>Repetition</hi> of Blessed <hi>Sounds;</hi> a <hi>Restection</hi>
of Holy <hi>Images</hi> falling from above; <hi>This</hi> is the <hi>World</hi> in which thou livest.</p>
            <p>Dost thou not feel <hi>Desire</hi> awakened in thee? Hast thou not a secret sense
of high Joys infus'd into thy Soul? then spread thy Spirit thorow this world;
take it into thy Spirit, as the <hi>Noise</hi> of a Harmony sounding from far. Take in
<hi>thy self,</hi> as a <hi>Part</hi> of this Noise. Pass thorow this world, as a <hi>Throng</hi> of <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions,</hi>
thy self being <hi>One</hi> among the rest. Ascend now with these; for if thou
slide <hi>downward,</hi> thou <hi>siakest</hi> out of them into a <hi>waste Desert:</hi> But if thou be
carried <hi>upward</hi> in them, they will still grow sweeter, brighter, and fuller to
thee, till they bring thee to their <hi>first Fountain,</hi> where thou and they toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be wrapt up into an <hi>Immortal Fulness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus this</hi> Shallow <hi>world will have a</hi> Depth <hi>in it, sfill to</hi> centent <hi>thee, and
still to</hi> carry <hi>thee on farther; while it shall still have a</hi> Relative Delight, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>nders.
<hi>So let my Soul say to my God.</hi> Highest Beauty! Greatest Love! I and this
World, into which thou hast brought me, are for signs of thee, so to move won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and delight. O! that I might be in the midst of them; that they might be unto
me, as figures only of thee, subsisting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nly in thee. <hi>So</hi> these slight things would
have a Divine Fulness; for even they would be thy Pleasures, thy Glories, O God!
as in a figure.</p>

               <hi>Ans. 2. We are in a World of Meer Images.</hi> The multitude of Creatures is
often in <hi>Scripture</hi> compar'd to <hi>Waters;</hi> for as <hi>Water</hi> they receive the <hi>Images</hi>
of heavenly things without the <hi>Substance</hi> into their thin passing streams. Look
then on <hi>These,</hi> and immediately cast thy Eye upward to the <hi>Substances</hi> which
shine fixt above, and shed these <hi>Glimpses</hi> of <hi>themselves.</hi> O Men! why do you
cast your selves so ardently on the <hi>Faces</hi> of Beauty in these <hi>unstable Waters?</hi>
You can embrace <hi>Nothing;</hi> you can meet <hi>Nothing</hi> to <hi>sustain</hi> you. You sink
and perish in the midst of these <hi>wavy Sun-shines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Creation is often call'd a <hi>Sea.</hi> The <hi>Sea</hi> is <hi>unfruitful;</hi> nothing can
take <hi>Root</hi> in the <hi>floods; untam'd,</hi> devouring all things. We are launcht forth
upon this <hi>Sea</hi> of Appearances, in this Vessel, the <hi>Body,</hi> not to <hi>Dwell</hi> or <hi>Grow</hi>
upon it, much less to <hi>Throw</hi> our selves into it; but to <hi>Glide</hi> swiftly over the
<hi>Face</hi> of it, to a firm Land of Bliss. But, alas! what throngs of people are there
on every side casting themselves with a furious Delight into this <hi>Gulf,</hi> where
every <hi>Wave</hi> is a <hi>Grave,</hi> when it once receives thee? <hi>Most,</hi> the <hi>Wisest, linger</hi>
and <hi>dally</hi> on this rolling, roaring Deep, till their <hi>Vessel</hi> worn out, or split up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some Rock, they be swallowed up in the midst of the <hi>Floods,</hi> and never
reach the wished Shoar of <hi>Immortality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Angels <hi>signifie</hi> Messengers. <hi>The Best things of this world are</hi> Invitations
<hi>only,</hi> Messengers <hi>sent forth to</hi> call <hi>the</hi> Guests: <hi>They cannot</hi> Feast <hi>us: They
have not</hi> for us. <hi>All cry</hi> Wisdom; <hi>That which we</hi> show, <hi>and you</hi> seek, <hi>is not</hi>
in us. I am not He. <hi>We are not</hi> The Life, Beauty, Ioy, <hi>but a</hi> Voice crying in
the Wilderness, <hi>in a vast</hi> Emptiness. Come, taste and see how good the Lord is;
what satisfactory sweetnesses are in the Godhead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joseph</hi> sent Asses laden with provisions, and Waggons, to bring his Father
<hi>Jacob</hi> with his Family into <hi>egypt.</hi> Our <hi>Younger Brother,</hi> the <hi>New Man,</hi> the
<hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> hath sent forth the Contents of this Life, as <hi>Waggons</hi> and <hi>Asses,</hi>
to bring the <hi>Old Man</hi> out of the Flesh, into the Bosom of the Father, the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of Eternity, there to rejoyce for ever with our Brethren, all the Children
of the Great King. How foolish a thing is it for us to mistake the <hi>Waggon</hi> for
the <hi>Court,</hi> which is only the <hi>Convoy?</hi> How brutish a thing is it to forget the
Glories of our <hi>Father's House,</hi> that we may run, feed, lie down with the <hi>Asses?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 3. <hi>Whence come we?</hi> Whence are <hi>Shadows</hi> cast? from their <hi>Substances.</hi>
Whence do <hi>Images</hi> flow? from their <hi>Original.</hi> From an Immutable <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
from an Eternal <hi>Original</hi> are we then come forth into this world. Then
shall we never have <hi>Rest,</hi> till we <hi>Return</hi> thither again. Our <hi>first Seed</hi> will be
most <hi>Inward</hi> with us, and <hi>Inseparable</hi> from us; it will travel with us thorow all
Forms still working in us, still wearing out, and casting off all Forms, in which
it <hi>sojourns</hi> with us, until it bring us back into <hi>it self,</hi> and become our only
<hi>Clothing,</hi> our only <hi>Content.</hi>

               <hi>Hagar</hi> was flying from the face of her Mistress <hi>Sarah;</hi> but she meets an
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49838:17"/>
Angel that sweetly sends her back thither, where God would provide for her
<hi>Sarah</hi> is the <hi>Divine Form</hi> in the Spirit; <hi>Hagar,</hi> this <hi>Fleshly Being,</hi> the <hi>Bond-woman.</hi>
This <hi>Earthly Nature</hi> is unable to bear the frowns and severity of her
<hi>Heavenly Mistress;</hi> she flies from <hi>her Face, her Appearances,</hi> which oppress the
Flesh with their Glory. But the bright Images of this Beauty, as <hi>Angels,</hi> meet
the <hi>Natural Man</hi> in the way of his flight, in the <hi>Principles</hi> of Nature. By the
flashes and breakings forth of these, Man is persuaded to return, and submit
himself to the supreme Beauty, his <hi>Mistress</hi> and <hi>Parent;</hi> so only shall he have
provisions of <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Rest</hi> from his wandrings.</p>

               <hi>Our</hi> Saviour <hi>takes a sweet farewel of the Earth in this language,</hi> Iob. 16.
v. 28. I came forth from the Father into the world; again I leave the world,
and go to the Father. <hi>Happy is that Soul, that after all her weary steps tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the world, to seek Content, now tyred, thinks of Returning to her Father,
her first Husband; and breaths forth such sighs as these towards him:</hi> O my
God! Thy Fulness is the womb, out of which I was brought forth into this world:
Thy Sweetness is the Bosom, in which I must eternally rest. How long shall I linger
here? O when shall I once leave this world, and come again to thee?</p>
            <p>Q. 4. <hi>How come we hither?</hi> Thorow a <hi>Darkness.</hi> You shall in the first of
<hi>Genesis</hi> see, that <hi>Darkness</hi> is the <hi>Ground</hi> of this Creation, and all <hi>Light-Colours</hi>
are laid upon that Ground. <hi>Darkness</hi> is the <hi>Bound</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
thorow which all things pass out of one into the other.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Darkness</hi> holds forth to us the <hi>Light</hi> of a <hi>Twofold Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rule 1. <hi>Let us not think to know eternal things by the Light of this World, or
any Creature.</hi> When we come into this life, we come well drencht, drawn
thorow a Sea of Darkness. There is no more any <hi>Remembrance</hi> of former
things. We know not where we were, when God laid the Foundations of the
Earth; or, what we were before that, when all our <hi>Bones</hi> were first <hi>written</hi>
by God, in <hi>his Book;</hi> when first those <hi>Eternal Forms,</hi> which were to <hi>frame</hi>
and <hi>sustain</hi> every shape or state, into which we should pass, were brought
forth in the <hi>Divine Wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are of <hi>Yesterday,</hi> and know nothing. We are started up into this Life
thorow a Darkness behind us, which lies upon all things which are beyond
this Image before us, and swallows up this into it self, as it passeth along. <hi>Vain
Man would be wise, though he be born, as the wild Asses Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</hi> Why should
Man undertake to bring forth from himself the Beauties of Wisdom, when he
comes upon the face of the Earth out of the same Darkness with the Asses Colt,
as void, as that, of all Eternal Images?</p>
            <p>Rule 2. <hi>Care not to cloath your selves with the Contents of this World,</hi> all
which you must put off, so soon as you touch the Brim of this Darkness, into
which you must return. Care not for the Cares or Sorrows of this Life. Those
waters of Forgetfulness, into which we must all descend, will wash them all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49838:18"/>
away. Imagine this Life, as an <hi>Island,</hi> surrounded with a <hi>Sea</hi> of Darkness;
beyond which lies the <hi>main Land</hi> of Eternity. Blessed is he, that can raise
himself to such a Pitch, as to look off this Island, beyond that Darkness, to the
utmost bound of things. He sees his <hi>way before,</hi> and <hi>behind</hi> him. What shall
trouble him, on this <hi>Twig</hi> of Life, on which he is like a Bird but now <hi>aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
from a far Region, from whence again he shall immediately take his <hi>Flight?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou cam'st through a darkness hither, but <hi>Yesterday</hi> when thou wer't born.
Why then shouldst thou not more readily, and cheerfully return thorough the
same darkness back again to those everlasting Hills?</p>
            <p>Let us then ever be in Tune to sing, that sadly sweet Song of Far-seeing,
and <hi>so</hi> much-suffering, <hi>Job,</hi> Job. 1. 21. <hi>Naked came I out of my Mother's
womb; Naked shall I return thither again. The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh.
Blessed be the name of the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Darkness into this World, strip't of all the Glories above. Naked must thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again out of this World, quite strip't of all the Glories; and Griefs here:
The Lord gives thee forth thorough this Darkness into this <hi>Life:</hi> the Lord
takes thee in thorough the Darkness out of this Life to Himself. Blessed is
the Name of the Lord. Rest thou in the Blessed and Glorious Workings of
the High God, while thou art in that Darkness. Thou shalt suddenly be pass'd
beyond it; where thou shalt in an open Light enjoy the Hidden workings
there; where thou shall see the Highest Beatitudes and Glories, <hi>Eye to Eye, Heart
in Heart;</hi> They and Thou, being made One Life, One Spirit, and without
<hi>Partition</hi> or <hi>Vail.</hi>

from the Love and Delight, which from them flow into our Spirits: what
<hi>Sights,</hi> what <hi>Things</hi> above <hi>Words</hi> are there then <hi>in Jesus Christ?</hi> what <hi>Ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
would surprize us, and snatch us out of <hi>Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Nature</hi> and this World is but the <hi>Earthly, Inferiour, Imperfect Image</hi> of God,
and of the Person of Christ, which is the <hi>Heavenly,</hi> and <hi>Supream Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we under-value and neglect the sweetnesses of our <hi>Saviour</hi> for this
<hi>World's</hi> joyes. But if we saw <hi>Him,</hi> we should much more despise, Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Worlds, ten thousand times heightned in Glory; as a heap of <hi>Dunghills,</hi>
in Comparison of <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Blindness,</hi> our <hi>Blindness</hi> clips the wings of Desire, clogs the Spirit of
Delight in us. O <hi>Jesus!</hi> cast thou but <hi>one Glimpse</hi> of thy self into our souls,
and we shall run from all things after thee, fly beyond all things towards Thee.
How <hi>Dark</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> things are these <hi>Shadows</hi> to him, that hath seen the <hi>Light</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The Power of Darkness, and Division, prevailing over the Powers of Light,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are then</hi> two Powers, as two Parts <hi>in this</hi> Image.</p>

Princely Title:</hi> Colos. 1. 13. Who hath delivered us out of the Power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
into the Kingdom of his Dear Son. <hi>It is read thus in</hi> Greek: out of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality
of Darkness, into the Kingdom of the Son of his Love, <hi>The</hi> Devil, <hi>as
the Prince of</hi> Darkness, <hi>which implies</hi> Division, <hi>is opposed to</hi> Iesus Christ, <hi>the
King of</hi> Love, <hi>which is</hi> unity, <hi>and lives only in</hi> Light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again:</hi> Ephes. 6. 12. We fight against the Rulers of the Darkness of this

            <p>The Devil in this <hi>Darkness</hi> lies, as a <hi>Stain</hi> upon the <hi>Beauties</hi> of the whole
Creation; defacing the Image, dimming the Glory of God in them. He lies,
as a <hi>Cloud</hi> upon all the <hi>Contents</hi> of the Creature; spreading a melancholy Shade
over them, infusing a Poyson of Fears, Falshoods, Deceits, Mistakes, Dangers,
Death into them. He is a <hi>Prison,</hi> and a <hi>Chain</hi> Shutting up, holding down the
Spirits of men, when they would break forth, and raise themselves into that
Light of Divinity, which faintly glimmers in this Darkness. Such is the <hi>First

<hi>Circlings</hi> of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> by which he folds, and wraps up himself in himself.</p>
            <p>This Serpent, before he spake to the Woman, tempted himself with this
glittering language. Es. 14. 14. <hi>I will be like the most High.</hi> The first word
in this aspiring speech is that, which first made him a <hi>Devil</hi> of an <hi>Angel: I:</hi>
The establishing of a <hi>Proper Interest</hi> divided from the <hi>general Interest</hi> of things
in the God-head. This <hi>Self-love</hi> is the <hi>Horned head;</hi> into which he then sprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
forth; the <hi>Cloven Foot,</hi> in which he ended; when he first with-drew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from the all-comprehending Unity, into a Circle, and Center of his own.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Power, Lust.</hi> This is a praegnancy to multiply <hi>himself;</hi> to bring forth
<hi>himself</hi> in strange, and diverse forms; upon strange and diverse Images. <hi>God
is One, Gal.</hi> 3. 20. God brings forth himself <hi>in One Image,</hi> Jesus Christ is
his <hi>Only-begotten Son: Joh.</hi> 1. 14. God brings forth all things <hi>by</hi> this One
Image, and <hi>in</hi> it: <hi>Coloss. 1. 16. In him were all things Created.</hi> The Devil is
contrary to God in all this. He is that <hi>Son of God,</hi> which broken, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by his Fall from the First Unity; goes full of monstrous Lust after the
<hi>Daughters of Men,</hi> dark, divided, fleshly Images of the Creature. With these
he mingles himself; so he brings forth himself and them into <hi>Gyantly shapes,</hi>
and in a Brood of Gyants. <hi>Gyants,</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> signifie, <hi>Dead, Distracted; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious</hi>
Forms, as appearing from the shades below; or faln, and sunk thither.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls this Spirit of <hi>Lust:</hi> Joh. 8. 45. <hi>The Father of Lyes:</hi>
because he begets himself upon all things in base, spurious, and various Shapes.
<hi>Solomon</hi> represents the Image of the Devil in Flesh, and this World, by a <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
Woman;</hi> because she lusts after, and wanders thorow all the diversity of
divided Forms in the Devil.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Power, Covetousness.</hi> Pro. 30. 16. <hi>There are two things, that never say,
enough: the Grave, and the Barren Womb.</hi> This Invisible Power is a <hi>Womb</hi> of
Darkness, which takes in all things; but brings forth nothing. So the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is never enlightned, but ever increas'd, made deeper and more devouring.
This Spirit is the <hi>Invisible Grave,</hi> which draws all things into it. But then it
crumbles them into <hi>Dust;</hi> it divides them from themselves. So the Principle
of <hi>Division</hi> is sharpned, not satisfied: fretted to a greater wideness, not fill'd.</p>
            <p>This is the Serpent <hi>feeding upon Dust;</hi> ever encompassing the Earth. This
is the <hi>Bottomless Pit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Power, Pride. <hi>The Devil under this</hi> property <hi>is call'd Is. 14. 12. Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi>
the Son of the Morning. <hi>He saith,</hi> v. 13. I will exalt my Throne above
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49838:19"/>
the Stars of God. <hi>His ambition is to shine</hi> alone; <hi>and as he riseth to put out all
other Lights by the Malignity of his appearance. He goes on: v.</hi> 13. I will
sit upon the Mount of the Congregation, in the sides of the North. <hi>The appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of our Lord Jesus in the double flame of Terror and Triumph: Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and Crowning; is from the</hi> North: <hi>Ezek,</hi> 1. 4. The Mount of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
<hi>is Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>where the</hi> General Assembly, and Church or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the First-born are, <hi>Hebr, 12. 22, 23. This is the Mount lifted up
above every Mountain: The Spirit exalted above every Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Devil would seat himself upon this Mount in the place of Jesus Christ;
to be, as he is, the <hi>Onely One.</hi> Yet he would have it with this difference; to be
the top of the Mount, while the great Congregation sit, as the Clouds, under
his Feet: to be a consuming Fire to all others; a Crowning Glory, only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>God is the Heavenly <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> where all things are <hi>Fellow-citizens.</hi> The
Devil is that <hi>Babel,</hi> which saith; <hi>I sit alone as a Queen,</hi> Revel. 18. She thinks
her self never Great, till she have swallowed up all her Companions; never
Great enough, till she be Great alone. This is the difference between <hi>Pride,</hi>
and <hi>Plenty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Power, Envy.</hi> This <hi>Power</hi> is a <hi>Reflection of Darkness and Division upon
it self, from the Sense of Beauty and Unity else-where.</hi> It is Mystically describ'd,
Revel. 20. 1. <hi>An Angel came down from Heaven with a Chain in one hand,
a Key in the other,</hi> v. 2. <hi>He took hold of the Dragon, the old Serpent, and bound
him up in the Bottomless Pit.</hi> Divine Wisdom is that <hi>Chain</hi> which reacheth
from the Top of Heaven to the Center of the Earth; where at both ends, it
meets, and is fastned in God. The several Ranks of things, the distinct Orders of
Causes and effects are the <hi>Links</hi> of this Chain mutually enwrapping each other.
The <hi>Key</hi> is a Divine Light, and Spiritual Power, which fastneth, or looseth,
draws up, or lets down; waves this Chain, and every Link of it, at pleasure.
The <hi>Angel</hi> represents our <hi>Lord Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he brings forth this Glory from God to men; He by it takes such
hold of that Power of envy in the Devil; that he makes him to sink himself
deeper, lock himself up fast, into the Bottomless Pit, into his own dark and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
Principle.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Power, Passion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Passion</hi> is a <hi>Rage kindled, and heightned by Resistance.</hi> It
is said of the Devil, <hi>He hath great wrath, because he hath a short time,</hi> Revel.
12. 12. He is in that <hi>Chapter</hi> set before us, as a <hi>Dragon.</hi> A <hi>Dragon</hi> hath his
upper part <hi>winged,,</hi> like a <hi>Bird,</hi> that flies in the air: his lower parts <hi>Snaky,</hi> like
a <hi>Serpent</hi> crawling on the Earth. So is <hi>Passion,</hi> partly rais'd to its own pitch,
and height, there breathing flames, and sparkling fury: partly kept down, laid
low in the Dust by opposition.</p>
            <p>The Devil in this Power is, as Fire shut up in close matter, Earth, or Iron;
where it burns with a Fierce and dismal Rednes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49838:20"/>
7. Power, Enmity, or Despair. <hi>God is</hi> Eternal Life: <hi>The Devil is</hi> Eternal
Death <hi>and Ruine:</hi> Apollyon, Abaddon: <hi>Revel. 9. 11. The Mystery of God
is</hi> a Fellowship, <hi>Ephes. 3. 9. The Mystery of the Devil is</hi> a Desolution: <hi>Es.</hi> 66. 24.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ is a <hi>Brasen Serpent,</hi> lifted up; a Glorious, Eternal Principle of
<hi>Distinction,</hi> dividing between the nearest Forms, bringing each one forth to a
naked Discovery in its own Property; and all in his own Divine Light. The
Devil is a <hi>Fiery Serpent</hi> below on the Earth; a Dark, Furious Principle of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,</hi>
separating all Forms of things, setting each apart in its full Power, in
the midst of his Hellish Flames.</p>
            <p>These are the <hi>Seven Heads</hi> of that monstrous <hi>Half</hi> of the Devil's <hi>Image,
the Power of Division.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Man in the <hi>Gospel</hi> possess'd by the Devil was a shadow of the Devil in
this <hi>Twofold Shape of Darkness</hi> and <hi>Division. He was ever among the Tombs,
tearing and rending his own flesh.</hi> So this Distracted <hi>Spirit</hi> dwels in himself, as
in a <hi>Living Tomb,</hi> into which he labours to draw all other things. He is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
dividing, and Tearing all things, but most of all himself.</p>
            <p>Qu. I cannot pass from this <hi>Image,</hi> till I enquire how <hi>Man</hi> was brought
forth in it. Our Saviour fully sets forth the Truth, and manner of this in one
word: <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil,</hi> Joh. 8. 44.</p>
            <p>We read in the Third of <hi>Genesis,</hi> of <hi>Two Seeds: The Seed of the Woman,</hi>
who was the Image given by God to Man, out of himself, through Man;
in which Image Man was to enjoy, and bring forth himself: <hi>The Seed of the
Serpent.</hi> When God had brought forth Man from a Divine Seed into a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and blessed Image: the <hi>Serpent</hi> sows his dark, and dividing seed in this
Fair Field. He brings forth man the second time from this poysonous Seed into
his own Image, in which he captivates the Image of God. Thus the Son of
God is become the Son of the Devil.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of lies and murthers by the <hi>Forbidden Tree,</hi> as by his own Image,
begets the Woman into the Form of sin, and death: through the Woman
he begets Man in the same Principle and State.</p>
            <p>Thus we see <hi>Man</hi> before his <hi>Conversion</hi> in the <hi>Image of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Image of Divine Wrath. <hi>This is</hi> God <hi>in a</hi> Twofold appearance:
<list>
                  <item>1. Fire.</item>
                  <item>2. Smoak.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Appearance, Fire. Who shall dwell with Everlasting Burnings:</hi> Es. 33.
14. The Nature of <hi>Fire</hi> is to work upon <hi>Confused</hi> things, to <hi>Separate</hi> them
in their <hi>Distinctions;</hi> to <hi>gather</hi> them together in their <hi>Affinities.</hi> So the
<hi>Fire</hi> in a <hi>Stick,</hi> makes the <hi>Fiery</hi> part to take its way by it self; while the <hi>Airy</hi>
part vapours into Smoke; the <hi>Earthy</hi> falls down-ward into Dust; the <hi>Water</hi>
weeps out at the ends of the Stick.</p>
            <p>The Forms of things in <hi>Flesh</hi> lie hudled, and imprison'd one in another. God
comes down upon the Creature in his <hi>Wrath,</hi> as in a Fire; to Consume that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49838:20"/>
dark <hi>Band</hi> of Confusion, that <hi>Bar</hi> of division, the <hi>Flesh;</hi> to <hi>Dispose</hi> all things
into their several <hi>Varieties;</hi> to <hi>Collect</hi> all things into their proper <hi>Unities,</hi> both
the <hi>Vailing,</hi> and the <hi>Vailed</hi> Forms.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Appearance, Smoak.</hi> So the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God is describ'd: Psal. 18. 8. <hi>A
Smoak went up out of his Nostrils.</hi> Fuel by <hi>Smoak</hi> passeth into a <hi>Flame:</hi> the
<hi>Flame</hi> again works itself into a <hi>Smoak,</hi> and so vanisheth. God, as a <hi>Smoak</hi>
darkens the Glory of the Creature, and so draws it into the Fire. Again he
carries it out of the Fire into a fine cloud of <hi>white Smoak,</hi> which disappears
to appear again in the God-head. Thus the <hi>Smoak</hi> is God's clothing, as he
goes into the Fire, as he comes out of it; both <hi>Ascending,</hi> and <hi>Descending.</hi> Yet
withal the Smoak, and the Fire are mingled too.</p>
            <p>Man stands <hi>Naturally</hi> in this <hi>Image of Wrath,</hi> as in his deepest Root, next
the God-head in its naked being. Out of this he Springs, into this he Sinks.
So <hi>St. Paul</hi> signifies, <hi>Ephes. 2. 3. And were by Nature the Children of Wrath,
as well as others.</hi> We are the Children of this <hi>Three-fold Image; Nature;
Devil; Wrath; Subordinately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God comes forth in an Image of <hi>Wrath.</hi> This brings forth <hi>Devils.</hi> These
wrap themselves up in the <hi>Natural Seed,</hi> which first brings forth the <hi>Natural
Image,</hi> then thorow that breaks forth into a <hi>Devil,</hi> out of which it grows
up into a Form of <hi>Divine Anger.</hi> So the most <hi>Radical Principle</hi> puts forth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
last into appearance; as the Rational life in Man.</p>
            <p>Thus much of the <hi>Three Images.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use. Admonition.</hi> Let us take heed of <hi>Sin,</hi> for its <hi>Father's sake the Devil;</hi>
and for <hi>its own.</hi> This <hi>Admonition</hi> will make its way into your Spirits; if from
that, which hath been said, you seriously consider <hi>Two Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Nature of the Devil.</item>
               <item>2. The Nature of Sin.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>The Nature of the Devil.</hi> Behold in this, as in a Glass, <hi>Four</hi> unlovely <hi>Spectacles:</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Solitude.</item>
               <item>2. Horrour.</item>
               <item>3. Torture.</item>
               <item>4. Ugliness.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Spectacle, Solitude.</hi> As a high and dreadful Cliff upon some dangerous
Shoar: such a <hi>Solitude</hi> is the Devil. I, <hi>saith he will be like the most High:</hi> as high
as he; but with this difference: God is <hi>above</hi> all, and <hi>in</hi> all: The Devil would
be <hi>above</hi> all, and <hi>without</hi> all: God is such a <hi>Height,</hi> as is <hi>all in all:</hi> The Devil
would be <hi>all alone:</hi> God is <hi>alone,</hi> but so, as that he is <hi>One</hi> with <hi>all</hi> Things:
The Devil would be <hi>alone,</hi> but as a <hi>Precipice</hi> broken off <hi>from</hi> all things.</p>
            <p>As the Mouth of a Burning Mountain, which wasts all things round about
it, and makes the neighbouring Circuit a wide Desolation: such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a <hi>Solitude</hi> is
the Devil, Revel. 12. He is represented, as a <hi>Dragon ready to devour the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child,
so soon, as he is born.</hi> As a Dragon in his lonely Den, the Country a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
all about: So is this Fiery Spirit eager to consume all appearances of
Life, and God upon their first discovery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49838:21"/>
As the <hi>Night,</hi> which entombs all things in it self, and makes the richest va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Shapes, but one Lonely shade: such a <hi>Solitude</hi> is the Devil.</p>
            <p>Consider this, all ye who cleave to the Noise, Glories, Pleasures of this world,
and leave your God, least you should be <hi>Melancholy.</hi> See, and tremble to see
into what a Melancholy Shade, what a solitude your souls pass, when you die.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Spectacle, Horrour.</hi> Imagine a <hi>world,</hi> where <hi>over your head</hi> instead of a
<hi>Sky,</hi> black, pitchy Clouds perpetually roul, not suffering any Glimpse of Light,
or Day ever to appear: <hi>under your feet,</hi> instead of Land, or Sea, a vast, amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
depth, which no where by nothing bounds your sight, or thought: <hi>round
about you,</hi> a Desolate Darkness, presenting near, and at furthest distance, all those
Forms, which are bred in the womb of darkness, and carry an astonishing
darkness with them to the Senses, and Spirits of Men; like apparitions, Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
Shrieks, dying Groans, roaring Tempests, Howling of wild Beasts; to
a man alone in a Forrest at Midnight. Such a world of Horrours is this <hi>Evil
Spirit.</hi> Therefore he is set forth by the <hi>Outward Darkness, where the Worm dies
not:</hi> a Darkness without <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Limit,</hi> in which all gnawing Forms of Horrour
live. Let him, that hates not that world of Curses, love this world of Varities,
For the Vanities of one are the <hi>Porch</hi> to the Vexations of the other.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Spectacle, Torture.</hi> Every Wound is a <hi>Division.</hi> What are <hi>Fears, Pains,
Griefs, Death? Separations</hi> of <hi>Desires</hi> from their <hi>Delights, Faculties</hi> from their
<hi>Objects, Principles</hi> from their <hi>Act, End, Perfection;</hi> in a word, <hi>Things</hi> from
<hi>Themselves.</hi> All Deaths and Tortures then are in the Devil, at their heighth,
in their fullest Power. For he is the <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of Division.</p>
            <p>The Life of this Mighty Creature is a <hi>Two-edged, Flaming Sword</hi> in the
midst of itself. Each Act, and Motion of life is the <hi>Brandishing</hi> of this Sword,
Cutting and Burning in every Part, and point of life with ten thousand An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Spectacle, Ugliness, Deformity</hi> is <hi>Darkness</hi> with a <hi>Disproportion.</hi> Darkness
in harmony with Light makes a Beauty. So the Evening and the Morning
make a Day. So the Night, and sleep are the shade of an Angel's wing, drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
sweet sleep, and rest on Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Proportion</hi> is a <hi>Kind,</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Unity. Disproportion</hi> is a <hi>Division</hi> without
any form of <hi>Unity.</hi> Where this Division, and Darkness first meet, there is the
<hi>Center</hi> of Ugliness, the Fountain of ugly things. This is the <hi>Babel,</hi> where
<hi>Ziim</hi> and <hi>Ijim</hi> dwell, <hi>Unclean Birds;</hi> Forms dry without any beautiful Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
desolate, no pleasant plant of Life, putting forth it self there; irksome, and
hateful, being surrounded with a rude Darkness, like rocky, uncouth Islands
in a Tempestuous Sea; or <hi>Screech-Owles</hi> in a Melancholy Night.</p>
            <p>These are the <hi>Four Spectacles</hi> of dread, &amp; death, in the Nature of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:
<hi>Solitude, Horrour: Torture,</hi> and <hi>Ugliness.</hi> Now make up these <hi>Four</hi> into
<hi>One,</hi> let that <hi>One</hi> be a <hi>Living Spirit</hi> of greatest <hi>Activity,</hi> and <hi>Capacity:</hi> This
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49838:21"/>
is the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>Bottomless Pit</hi> of Things; the <hi>Unpassable Gulf,</hi> which divides
Heaven from Hell. This is the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now before you commit a Sin, propound this <hi>Question</hi> to your selves: Can I
eternally wander in a Darkness, where I shall never meet Companion or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort?
Can I make everlasting Clouds my Canopy? Can I lie under these at
Rest? Can I sleep sweetly over an unknown, roaring Deep? Can I imbrace
Fire, feed on Poysons, drink down Tortures, like Water? Can I make those
hateful Shapes, at which, when they appear, the stoutest men grow stiff with
horrour, and feel their hair to stand on end upon their heads? Can I make these
ghastly, dismal things my <hi>Play-fellows?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you can do all this, then go, sin freely. But if these be Terrours above
Man, to bear: take heed, and start at a <hi>Lust,</hi> more than you would at a <hi>Ghost,</hi>
for these are but weak <hi>Types</hi> of those Tormenting <hi>Truths,</hi> which Sinners must
try below. For, as <hi>God</hi> makes <hi>Heaven;</hi> so the <hi>Devil</hi> is the <hi>Hell,</hi> into him do
all polluted Souls descend; they dwell, not only <hi>with,</hi> but <hi>in</hi> Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Why should any doubt, whether there be a Devil. But alass! who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
him to be any thing besides a Scar-crow; except Children, or weak and
superstitious Spirits?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yet, you that thus reason, ask those <hi>Principles,</hi> that govern you:
Do not <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> shew, that all things have their <hi>Roots,</hi> out of which
they rise? Are there not such things, as <hi>Follies, Filths,</hi> and <hi>Furies</hi> spread through
the World? Are they not, if not the <hi>All,</hi> yet the <hi>Greatest part</hi> of the word?
Can these be, and no <hi>Spring</hi> be, in which they are <hi>United,</hi> and at their <hi>Height?</hi>
This <hi>Spring</hi> is this <hi>Spirit,</hi> which we call the <hi>Devil.</hi> This is that untam'd <hi>Sea,</hi> of
which <hi>Job</hi> speaks. Job. 7. 12. <hi>Am</hi> I <hi>a Sea, or Whale, that thou thus breakest me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What pity then is it to see Millions of men go with merry dalliance down
the streams of fleshly delights; and at the same time to see that Cloudy Sea of
Horrours, into which they are within a few moments delivered by these streams?</p>
            <p>If every thing make hast to its own <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Element; Fire</hi> to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Circle; <hi>Earth</hi> to its Center below: If it be Natural for every <hi>Plant</hi> to
bring forth its own <hi>Seed:</hi> then sure, it cannot be, but that each guilty Soul
should sink downward to the Element of Woe, and Horrours, the Center of
Darkness: then sure, every <hi>Sin</hi> must at last bring forth a <hi>Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You that love your <hi>lusts,</hi> more than your <hi>God,</hi> learn from your <hi>Bodies,</hi> the
state determin'd upon your <hi>Souls.</hi> Your <hi>Bodies</hi> are <hi>Dust,</hi> and to <hi>Dust</hi> they must
return. Your defiled <hi>Spirits</hi> are of their Father the <hi>Devil,</hi> and to him they
must again go, when they leave this World. This is the first consideration to
preserve us from Sin: <hi>The Nature of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Nature of Sin.</hi> We read no where of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> that she
was <hi>Possess'd</hi> according to the common acceptation of that word. We read,
that she was a <hi>Sinner, eminently, absolutely,</hi> without restraint, as if she, who is:

said to have been an <hi>Hostess,</hi> had been an <hi>Inne</hi> to all Sins. Yet she is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd:
Mark. 16. 9. <hi>Mary Magdalen, out of whom he had cast Seven Devils.</hi>
All <hi>Sins</hi> are rankt under <hi>Seven Heads.</hi> These are the <hi>Seven Powers</hi> of <hi>Evil,</hi>
in the <hi>Devil;</hi> which are, as so many <hi>Devils</hi> there. These are the <hi>Unclean
Spirits,</hi> which go forth from the Mouth of the <hi>Dragon</hi> into the breasts of all
the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam.</hi> Fly then from a <hi>Sin;</hi> for 'tis a <hi>Devil.</hi> Fly
from the sweetest Temptations. They may look like Angels: but they are
the <hi>Devil's Angels,</hi> the most immediate <hi>Emanations</hi> or Images from that foul
Principle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But you will say; <hi>What is Sin? How shall I know it?</hi> That I may fly from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> You may know it by the <hi>Image,</hi> it bears. Whatever you meet with
like a <hi>Devil</hi> any where, that's a <hi>Sin.</hi> Wherever you see the Cloven Foot of
<hi>Division,</hi> or the Horned head of <hi>Darkness;</hi> fly, and cry: an <hi>Apparition</hi> from
Hell.</p>
            <p>Take then <hi>Two Rules,</hi> which measure out every Sin.</p>
            <p>Rule 1. <hi>Every choice of an Act or Object, that draws you down, out of the
Light of God;</hi> is <hi>Sin.</hi> In the <hi>Light</hi> of God, we worship and love the Supream
Beauty; we possess the most perfect, and purest Pleasures; we grow up into
the Divine Image, which continually appears to us; we have all our Faculties
fill'd, enlarg'd to a Freedom, an Infiniteness. When we leave this <hi>Light,</hi> we
fall down before Idols, empty Shows of Beauty; so we become <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and
<hi>Adulterers;</hi> we mingle our selves with mixt Pleasures, Dark Delights; so we
<hi>pollute</hi> our selves: we are <hi>transform'd</hi> into every base, inferiour Image, with
which we converse: Our Souls are <hi>imprison'd</hi> in low, and narrow Objects,
where they beat themselves against the walls of their Prison into perpetual
vexations.</p>
            <p>Such are the <hi>Loves, Lusts, Ambitions, Entertainments</hi> of this World. <hi>The
Love of the World is Enmity with the Father:</hi> Ja. 4. 4. He that casts his eye
down upon the Earth, must necessarily take it off from Heaven. He that sets
his Face, as if he would go into the Embraces of Vanity; must have his back
upon the Eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>Rule 2. <hi>The Divided enjoyment of any particular Image apart from the
Image of God;</hi> is <hi>Sin. God is one.</hi> The <hi>Image</hi> of God is that, in which all
things are <hi>United.</hi> He that takes any Piece out of this <hi>Image,</hi> he breaks the
<hi>Unity,</hi> he makes a <hi>Wound,</hi> to let in Death, and Ruine.</p>
            <p>This makes <hi>Fleshly Lusts, Sins.</hi> Man and woman are each to other, the <hi>Image</hi>
of God, which is <hi>One.</hi> When therefore they rest not in the bosom of <hi>One A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi>
they commit the Sin of the Devil, in a <hi>Type.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Jude</hi> makes the Lustful Sin of <hi>Sodom</hi> an exemplar Copy of the Sin of
Angels: <hi>Jude 6. 7. The Angels kept not their first state, but left their own habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Even as</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>in like manner, giving themselves
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49838:22"/>
over to Fornication, and going after strange</hi> (divers, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Flesh, &amp;c.</hi> The
Sin of <hi>Devils</hi> was a <hi>Spiritual Whoredom,</hi> in which <hi>they</hi> dissolv'd the <hi>Unity</hi> of
the Divine Image, and fell into a <hi>Diversity</hi> of divided Images, as into a deep
Pit.</p>
            <p>Both are join'd together in <hi>Solomon.</hi> At once he multiplyed <hi>Wives,</hi> and <hi>Idols.</hi>
A Converse with the Creatures in Diverse Principles and Images is, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
of a Man with many Women. <hi>Fleshly Lust</hi> is the proper <hi>Image,</hi> and
<hi>Fruitfulness</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> by which he brings forth himself into this Visible
World most <hi>Naturally,</hi> and therefore most <hi>Potently,</hi> most <hi>Plentifully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will say; may we not enjoy the delights of the Creature,
which is an Inferiour Image?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Yes, as a Man may have a Conversation with many Women, so that
he break not the <hi>Marriage-Union.</hi> Thy <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>untain</hi> must be thine own. All de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
abroad must be, as <hi>Streams</hi> of this Fountain, not divided <hi>Springs.</hi> All
other Images must be onely <hi>Reflections</hi> of this One, &amp; <hi>concentred</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>Please thy self to the full with every Content. Only let it be no <hi>Cloud</hi> to
cut off: but a <hi>Christal</hi> to take in the Divine Glory, that this may shine, and
flame in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use 2. Consolation.</hi> Wretched Man: What wilt thou do? <hi>Hell</hi> is sown
in thy Nature. This is the Paradise, which is planted in thee; all manner of
loathsom, bitter, venemous deadly Plants. The <hi>Sap</hi> of these is the <hi>Life</hi> of thy
Spirit: the <hi>Fruit</hi> of these the <hi>Food</hi> of thy Life. What shall deliver thee?
Shall <hi>Time?</hi> No: As Nature puts forth itself in thee, so these Trees of baleful
Woe grow up. What shall reskue thee from them? Shall <hi>Death?</hi> No; When
thou puttest off this Natural Image, thou must then be transform'd into these
Invisible Plants, to be everlastingly inclos'd in them, to have one Root, one
Stock, one Sap, one Fruit for ever with them, that is, with Devils.</p>
            <p>Is there then no <hi>Help?</hi> There is. behold, <hi>God</hi> descends to be thy <hi>Saviour.</hi>
He comes by a <hi>Two-fold Step,</hi> and brings Salvation into thy Bosom.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Step.</hi> God comes into our <hi>Nature,</hi> as the <hi>Root</hi> of each single Person.
Here he becomes our <hi>Jesus,</hi> making himself a <hi>New Seed</hi> Out of this <hi>Seed</hi> he
brings forth a <hi>New Image</hi> of Divinity, by which he breaks thorow the <hi>Image</hi>
of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> brings forth <hi>Man</hi> out of them, brings them into
subjection to this growing Beauty. As the <hi>Fuel</hi> is dissolv'd into <hi>Smoak,</hi> and
the <hi>Smoak</hi> again breaks up into <hi>Flame:</hi> So the Image of the <hi>Devil</hi> riseth up
out of the Image of <hi>Nature,</hi> shaking that to Dust, as it riseth: The Image of
<hi>God</hi> again, sprouts forth in the midst of the <hi>Devils Image,</hi> First spoiling, then
Triumphing <hi>over,</hi> and <hi>in both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Step.</hi> God thorow <hi>Nature,</hi> as the <hi>Root,</hi> grows up into <hi>single Persons,</hi> as
the <hi>Branches.</hi> Then, as the shades of Night flie away before the Ascending
Day; so, as this Divine Seed our Jesus sends forth itself in an Image of Beauty
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49838:23"/>
thorow our Souls; the Image of Darkness and Death sinks down into its own
Place, and Principle.</p>
            <p>Love this Jesus then. You will love Him, when He shall do this. And He
that <hi>shall</hi> do it, <hi>will</hi> do it. He is the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branch.</hi> He is a <hi>Root,</hi> which holds
every other Root of Pollution and Perplexity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He will grow up thorow
them the <hi>Last</hi> of All. He is the <hi>Branch,</hi> that is imprison'd in every other Branch
of Death, and Hell, which will at last spread forth itself over All; if thou wait
for it. As the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> is <hi>Enmity</hi> and <hi>Despair:</hi> so the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> is
an <hi>Eternal Root</hi> of <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. State, That to which the Change is made in our Conversion. <hi>This is</hi> Three-fold.</p>

               <item>1. The Inward State in Nature.</item>
               <item>2. The Spiritual State, in Christ</item>
               <item>3. The Divine State, in God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>The Inward State, in Nature.</hi> The <hi>Change</hi> is for the most part, at first,
a <hi>Conversion,</hi> or <hi>Introversion</hi> into this <hi>State.</hi> This needs a <hi>Three-fold Explication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Explication. The Inward State, in Nature as it is in itself. <hi>Man is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
the Off-spring of God,</hi> Act. 17. 28. We are all his Off-spring. <hi>God hath
an</hi> Inward Glory, <hi>and</hi> Outward Cloathing. <hi>The Scripture speaks of both these,</hi>
Hebr. 1. <hi>It saith of</hi> One, <hi>v.</hi> 8. Thy Throne, O God, is for ever, and ever. <hi>It
saith of the</hi> Other, <hi>v.</hi> 10. Thou hast laid the Foundations of the Earth: the
Heavens are the Work of thine hands, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Thou foldest them up, as a Garment,
and they are changed. <hi>God over-spread his</hi> Outward Cloathing <hi>with his</hi> Inward
Glory. <hi>he possesseth</hi> both <hi>his</hi> Person, <hi>and his</hi> Vesture <hi>in One Fountain of Life.
So</hi> both <hi>become to him</hi> One <hi>Life and Beauty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Man is in <hi>Nature</hi> the Off-Spring, and Resemblance of God. So Man also
in his <hi>Natural State</hi> is composed of a <hi>Twofold Image,</hi> the one <hi>Inward,</hi> the
other <hi>Outward;</hi> the one the Image of <hi>God</hi> in Man, the other of the <hi>Creature.</hi>
While man stood in Innocency, he abode in the <hi>Inward Image,</hi> as his <hi>Center:</hi>
in that he Comprehended, and Commanded the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Creature.</hi> The
Image of <hi>God</hi> was <hi>Eden,</hi> the Fountain of pleasures within, from thence a <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
went forth watering the Image of the <hi>Creature,</hi> and making that a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi>
All things were <hi>Trees</hi> in this <hi>Paradise, good for food, and pleasant to the
Eye:</hi> Trees of perpetual <hi>Youth, Beauty, Pleasure</hi> to Man, Man was seated in this
<hi>Inward Image,</hi> as on his <hi>Throne,</hi> from which he commanded, and changed all
the Creatures into divers Shapes of Delight, at pleasure. This is the <hi>First Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Explication: The Departure of Man out of this Inward State.</hi> When
Man fell, he went forth from his <hi>Inward</hi> Glory, into the <hi>Outward</hi> Image, this
is signified, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. by the <hi>Woman</hi> yielding her self over to the Will of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent:</hi>
and the <hi>Man</hi> giving himself up to the Will of the <hi>Woman.</hi> So it was
true of <hi>Man,</hi> what is said of the <hi>Devils,</hi> Jude 6. He left his <hi>First Estate,</hi> and
his <hi>Proper Habitation.</hi> Now he lived wholly in the <hi>Out-forms</hi> of things which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49838:23"/>
he broke off from the <hi>Inward Image,</hi> and so made them all an <hi>Image</hi> of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Darkness, and Death; keeping the Image of God <hi>imprisoned</hi> in this Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Image, which suffered it not to put forth itself, or appear.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth this <hi>Departure,</hi> as the Root of all Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18. All
wickedness is there sum'd up in this: <hi>Detaining the Truth of God in Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi>
That is, keeping down the Image of God, and True Glory, in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
and false Image.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Explication. The return of Man into this Image,</hi> Man hunting, and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thorow the exteriour face of things, finds neither his desired Prey, nor
Rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Poor Man! oppressed with cares and sorrows, he sinks down by a sad
Retirement to the bottom of his own Spirit. There he happily falls into the
bosom of the <hi>Divine Image,</hi> which lay buried under the Ruines of his Soul.
Here he catcheth some Glimpses of Immortal beauty, some Tasts of a high
delight, some sense of a true Rest. Now he loaths the Empty, Tedious, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
Follies of this Outer World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> experimented this in himself, <hi>Psal. 16. 7. My Reins instruct me in
the Night-season.</hi> When a Night of <hi>nature,</hi> or <hi>melancholy</hi> takes away these sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
forms of things from us, or makes them a Torture to us: then this <hi>Hidden
Image</hi> from the retired Principles of Nature, from the secret of our souls, puts
up itself before us, draws us down into itself, makes its own Impressions upon
us; Impressions which have another manner of Light, Strength, Sweetness in
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Soul cries out in the language of</hi> Cain, <hi>to a sweeter purpose:</hi> How
have I been a Fugitive, and a Vagabond upon the Earth, while I have been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out from thy Face, and Presence, and thou beautiful Image of things! Come,
lock me up in thine Embraces, that I may never go forth more into that Outward
Court of things, which is troden down by the Feet of Lusts, and Confusions. Or
if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I must go forth again; O that I might carry thee forth with me, as my Brother,
that suckt the breasts of my Mother-Nature. I would kiss thee, and I should not
be despised. I would enjoy perpetual pleasures in thee; and no shame, but strength,
and glory should rest upon me.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Change</hi> into the <hi>Inward State, in Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Spiritual State, in Christ.</hi> The Change to this State we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
in <hi>Three Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>The Preparation</hi> in Man.</item>
               <item>2. The Spiritual State.</item>
               <item>3. The Passage of
Man into it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Part. The Preparation in Man to this Spiritual State.</hi> Man pursued by
Griefs from without, retired into the Inward Image, the Recess of Nature, as
<hi>David</hi> into his Cave, meeteth with a fresh, unexpected view of Beauties here.
Now he is refresh't, now he comes to himself. Now he begins to raise himself,
and say, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did, when the eldest Son of <hi>Jesse</hi> was presented to him:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49838:24"/>
               <hi>Behold the Annointed of God is before me.</hi> Surely this is no other, than the <hi>Gate
of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after a little Tryal, Man finds this to be, but a <hi>Natural Image</hi> of God, an
<hi>Earthly Paradise</hi> only, which so soon as it puts forth is ready so soon to dis-appear
again. He finds it too weak to raise itself clearly from the bottom of those Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Vanity, Sin and Trouble, which have over-flown, and over-whelm'd it.
He perceives it too slight to satisfie him. 'Tis an <hi>Intimation</hi> of true joys, rather
than the <hi>Joys</hi> themselves. 'Tis a fair <hi>Invitation,</hi> no full <hi>Entertainment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mans joys and hopes here prove to him like the <hi>Seed</hi> sown in <hi>Rocky</hi> Ground;
which springs up suddenly, but suddenly withers, when once the Sun, the
Tempting Glories, or Scorching Furies of this World beat upon it.</p>
            <p>Now the Soul is, as <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> at the Grave of her Saviour; She looks
into her Heart for this Image but finds that gone, and her heart, as an empty
Grave. Then she cries; <hi>O my God; who hath taken these Comforts away? I
thought, that these should have delivered me, and dwelt for ever with me.</hi> But
wipe away thy Tears, distressed Soul. As Jesus carryed away his <hi>Natural
body</hi> from <hi>Mary,</hi> to bring it again a <hi>Spiritual body:</hi> So thy God hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
this <hi>Natural Image</hi> of divine joyes in thy Spirit; but he will restore,
and bring it into thy soul again a <hi>Spiritual Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>gives thee this</hi> Consolation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4. What the Law could not
do, being weak thorow the flesh. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the Righteousness of the Law might
be fulfill'd in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. <hi>The weakness
of</hi> Natures Inward Image <hi>prepares the Spirit of Man for the</hi> Spiritual State <hi>of
things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Part: The Spiritual State itself. <hi>The</hi> Prophet <hi>represents this in a</hi> Promise.
<hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28. I will pour forth my Spirit upon all Flesh. Three things <hi>are here to
be explained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Spirit. 2. Flesh. 3. Effusion, or Pouring forth of Spirit upon Flesh.</p>
            <p>1. The Spirit <hi>is the</hi> Unity <hi>of things:</hi> Ephes. 4. 3. The Unity of the Spirit.
Unity <hi>is appropriated to the</hi> Spirit. <hi>This</hi> Spirit <hi>is the most High God. For he
is the First, Supream, only</hi> Unity: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 20. God is One. <hi>God,</hi> eminently,
<hi>and</hi> exclusively, <hi>is</hi> One. <hi>This</hi> Spirit, <hi>the</hi> Unity <hi>is the Fountain, and Life of
Things. All sorts of Life, all Beauty every where are</hi> Images <hi>of this</hi> Self-comprehending,
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>-comprehending <hi>Unity. This is the</hi> Spirit.</p>
            <p>2. Flesh, Flesh, <hi>and</hi> Spirit <hi>differ, as</hi> Unity, <hi>and</hi> Division; <hi>or which is the
same, as</hi> Life, <hi>and</hi> Death: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6. To be Carnally-minded is Death: to be
Spiritually-minded is Life, and Peace. Life <hi>is the</hi> Unity <hi>of Things, in which they
Contain themselves.</hi> Death <hi>is the</hi> Division <hi>of Things from themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flesh</hi> is all Divided Forms of things in the Creature according to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> in this sense reckons <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi>
of Men, as <hi>Fleshly</hi> things. Though <hi>Angels</hi> are the most United Things, the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49838:24"/>
First <hi>Unities, or Springs</hi> in the Creature; and so <hi>Spirits.</hi> Yet they compared
with <hi>God</hi> are <hi>Compounded,</hi> and <hi>Divided</hi> Things, and so <hi>fleshly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> thus sums up under the name of <hi>Flesh,</hi> all things, that have a
<hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Division</hi> in them, by which they are cut off from their own <hi>Beauty</hi>
or <hi>Being;</hi> by which they fade, and fall away. This is <hi>Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>The</hi> Effusion, or Pouring forth of the Spirit upon Flesh. <hi>This signifies</hi>
Three things.</p>
            <p>1. The Spirit nakedly sustaining the Creature, as its Immediate Root, and
Principle. <hi>So the Spirit is a</hi> Spring <hi>pouring itself forth into</hi> Flesh, <hi>as it's</hi> Channel.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Spirit filling the Fleshly form with its Waters,</hi> with its clear and fresh
Streams, the workings of its own Life.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Spirit planting its own Image upon each Created Image;</hi> clothing and
overflowing it with its own Appearances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus St.</hi> Paul <hi>expresseth the</hi> Effusions, <hi>the</hi> Overflowings <hi>of the Spirit,</hi> Rom.
8. 6. To be Spiritually-minded is Life, and Peace. <hi>To be</hi> Spiritually-minded <hi>is
to see Things, as they are in their</hi> Spiritual State. <hi>In this</hi> State <hi>all things have
a</hi> Twofold Representation.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Represen. Life,</hi> true Life, without any mixture of Death. Every Sight
here is Life. For all things are seen; as growing up out of this <hi>Life-Principle,</hi>
the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and <hi>Themselves,</hi> as <hi>Powers</hi> of this <hi>Life</hi> displaying themselves, and
working in themselves.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Represen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peace.</hi> This is the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of that Life, in the <hi>Harmony</hi> of an
<hi>Inward Sweetness,</hi> an <hi>Outward Beauty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus this <hi>Spiritual State</hi> brings forth to Light again in itself, the <hi>Inward
Image</hi> of God, in <hi>Nature,</hi> For it shews all <hi>Fleshly Forms,</hi> being yet <hi>Fleshly,</hi> and
<hi>yet</hi> Harmonious Images of the Supream Unity, or Beauty. But it brings forth
this <hi>Natural Image</hi> with this <hi>Twofold Advantage.</hi> 1. It formerly grew upon
a <hi>Natural Principle,</hi> and so was subject to Decay. Now it is rooted in this <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Spirit,</hi> and so becomes Immortal. 2. It was in Nature an <hi>Image only</hi>
Now it is an <hi>Image,</hi> and a <hi>Glass.</hi> It doth not only <hi>Represent</hi> the Glories of the
<hi>Spirit</hi> by an empty <hi>Show:</hi> but it sets them before you as <hi>Present</hi> in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
substances, and so shining thorow it.</p>
            <p>Thus we have gone thorow the <hi>Second Part</hi> in this <hi>Head,</hi> and seen <hi>the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
State in itself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Part: The Passage of Man into this Spiritual State.</hi> When the Soul is
taught by her Experience, and her God; that the Secret Delights of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Image are for a <hi>Repast</hi> only, not a <hi>Repose;</hi> that in the strength of these;
as <hi>Eliah's</hi> food, brought by Angels, she is to travel thorow a Wilderness, the
Ruines of Nature, with all its <hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>Images;</hi> till she comes to the
<hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> Then she takes up a resolution; to stay no longer in this Field
of Swine with the Swine; but to make hast to her Fathers House, where every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49838:25"/>
               <hi>Servant</hi> hath <hi>Bread</hi> enough; each <hi>Fleshly Form</hi> is fill'd with a <hi>Substantial Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God hath secretly instructed the Soul thus to resolve, he as a tender-hearted
Father meets her in the beginning of these resolutions, falls upon her
neck, and kisseth her. God shews himself in the Soul, gives her sweet Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of his Love, carries her further off from the Outward Image, carries
her thorow the most retired Principles of Nature <hi>beyond,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> them, into
this <hi>Spiritual Principle,</hi> and State, which is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ; where God
and the Creature are United; where the <hi>Spirit</hi> is, as <hi>Water;</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi> as a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
<hi>Earth</hi> standing <hi>in</hi> that <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>out</hi> of it; being continually <hi>fed,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
made <hi>Fruitful,</hi> and <hi>Beautiful</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Jacob</hi> at the sight of the <hi>Waggons,</hi> which came from <hi>Joseph;</hi> so this Soul
now revives, she begins to be <hi>her self,</hi> and to live again, as after a long Trance,
or Death. She looks about, and sees her self at <hi>home,</hi> she perceives her self in
that Spirit; in which she came forth from God; in which she sees the Face of
God again; by which she is assured to be carryed on to the full and eternal
enjoyment of her God, and Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, saith the Soul;</hi> I have enough; I have not only seen the Face of my
God; but He hath made me to see His Seeds also; the Face of each Object, as the
Face of an Angel of God. Now let me die; that I entirely in my Body, and whole
Soul may be call'd home from my Banishment into this remote part of Things, the
Out-side of Nature. Now let me die in Peace, with this Spiritual Image in my
Embraces, this Sense of Ioys, and Glories in my Heart. Let me ever abide here,
O my God! never to go forth more from this Inner Chamber of the Great King
into the Tumultuous street of my senses, or sensual Reason. O that this Spiritual
State so full of ravishing Sights, which like the Sheet full of all living Creatures
before <hi>Peter,</hi> is now let down out of Heaven into my Soul; O! that it might
never be drawn up again; until it take me also up with it into Heaven.</p>
            <p>I have finisht the <hi>Second State</hi> of our Change at our <hi>Conversion:</hi> The <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
State, in Christ,</hi> I pass to the <hi>Third,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Divine State of things, in God.</hi> As <hi>Christ</hi> is the
<hi>way</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> So the
<hi>Divine State</hi> is the Spiritual State made <hi>Perfect.</hi> The Soul having been a while
taught in the Bosom of Christ, begins to grow up to a fuller sense of God, in
a more <hi>naked, abstracted, absolute, and comprehensive</hi> manner. Now she begins
to <hi>put off</hi> all, that ever she <hi>put on,</hi> that God may be her <hi>only Clothing.</hi> She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to think it not enough <hi>to live and walk in the Spirit of God;</hi> except she
<hi>be One Spirit with Christ, and God.</hi> She perceives some dark glimpse of that,
which is meant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. To <hi>Know, as we are Known;</hi> that is, <hi>in patrid,</hi>
at home <hi>in God, Comprehensively,</hi> by being Comprehended in God, and so
Comprehending him again.</p>
            <p>The Soul in the glimmering Light of this State brought forth in her Flesh,
as a small Candle in a dark Lanthorn, or faint twinklings of a Star in a Cloud;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49838:25"/>
the Soul rudely descries a difference between making the <hi>Creature</hi> the <hi>Glass,</hi>
thorow which we see <hi>God,</hi> and having the <hi>Godhead</hi> for the <hi>Glass,</hi> placing
itself next our <hi>Eye,</hi> and discovering all the <hi>Creatures in itself,</hi> this the Soul
climbs up towards, this makes her long for <hi>Heaven,</hi> that she may enjoy this
<hi>Beatifical Vision</hi> clearly, <hi>un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as'd</hi> of <hi>Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The imperfectest Beginnings, and rudest Hints of this State in the Soul are
to the other State; as <hi>Honey,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> to Milk. They melt the Spirit of Man
to a Transcendent Sweetness, and heighten it to a Triumphant Strength. As
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> saith of God out of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Psal. 82. 16. <hi>He saith of those
to whom the word of God came: I have said: Ye are Gods.</hi> Joh. 10. 35.
So saith the Soul to all things, as she looks upon them in this <hi>Divine State. Ye
are God-like Appearances, rising up out of God, and abiding in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> cries, 1 <hi>Sam. 28. 13. I see Gods ascending up out of the Earth.</hi> But
this Soul in this <hi>Divine Principle</hi> sees God Himself with the whole Troop of
the Sons of God, <hi>God-like Forms</hi> ascending out of every Point of the Earth,
and the lowest parts of things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use. Conviction.</hi> Consider with thy self after this manner, <hi>Am I Chang'd?</hi>
If I be not, I stand in the Circle of Vanity, Darkness, and Woe. I am gone
forth from my Center, outward, into a Waste Wilderness, whither no clear
Line of Light, or Life stretcheth itself; where are no Sparks of peace, or
joy, which are not scattered into wild Distractions, torn in pieces and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Confusion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Am I still wandering in this World?</hi> I am already upon the very Brink, and
Precipice of Things. Whither do I wander? Whither shall I fall, when I
die? Is there yet any thing beyond this World, further from God, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
besides the Place of Devils.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Four Discoveries</hi> of a Chang'd, or Unchang'd State.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Discovery. Have I seen a Resurrection in myself.</hi> Our <hi>Conversion</hi> is made
the same thing with the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our Saviour, <hi>Coloss. 3. 1. If ye be
risen with Christ.</hi> When Jesus <hi>rose again, He returned</hi> to that Glory, which
He had with God, before he was in Flesh. His <hi>Resurrection</hi> was a <hi>Return</hi> not
to that Life, which he had in the World; this was part of his Death: but to
that Life, which he had before This among Earthly Men. So when we <hi>Turn</hi>
to God, we <hi>Return</hi> truly to our selves. We perceive our Selves now to be our
Selves, and all below this, to have been a <hi>Shadow of</hi> us, or a <hi>Disguise upon</hi> us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conversion</hi> of Man is call'd an <hi>Awakening,</hi> Ephes. 5. 14. <hi>Awake thou,
that sleepest: stand up from the Dead.</hi> My God is a Light, in which all Things
are seen ever, as they were from the Beginning. My Jesus is a Life, in which
all things are the same Yesterday, before the World, as they shall be to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and for ever. My Soul! Art thou awakened into the Light, the Life of
thy God, thy Jesus? If thou art, what seest thou? Thou seest thy true, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49838:26"/>
               <hi>substantial Being,</hi> thy <hi>proper Person</hi> appearing; thou seest all things in their
<hi>first Principle,</hi> in their <hi>right state;</hi> thou seest every <hi>Inferiour Person,</hi> which thou
hast been cloth'd with, and each <hi>Lower State</hi> of Things, in which thou hast
acted any Part, as <hi>Dreams</hi> of a sleeping Man in the Night, out of which he
awakens the <hi>same,</hi> that he was, when first he lay down, and they vanish, as
<hi>Airy Images.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Gospel</hi> declares the <hi>Mystery, that was hid in God from the beginning of
the World,</hi> Ephes. 3. 9. If you have not beheld <hi>present things, things to come,
Heaven, Glory, your future State;</hi> as it was <hi>in the Mystery of God</hi> from <hi>Eternity:</hi>
you are still buried under the Ruines of this Confused <hi>World,</hi> beneath which
that <hi>Mystery</hi> lies hid.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Discovery. Can I tell the Difference between Flesh, and Spirit?</hi> A Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and a Regenerate Condition are thus distinguisht by <hi>Walking in Flesh,
or Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8. 4. The <hi>Eye</hi> guides the <hi>Feet.</hi> How can I walk after <hi>One,</hi> and
not the <hi>Other,</hi> if I know not, how <hi>One</hi> differs from the <hi>Other. The Light shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in Darkness, but the Darkness comprehended it not.</hi> The <hi>Flesh</hi> is the <hi>Darkness,</hi>
which understands neither the <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor <hi>itself,</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Light,</hi> in which
<hi>both</hi> are understood, and discern'd.</p>
            <p>Say thus to thy Heart: <hi>My Heart!</hi> Canst thou tell a way to possess all Things
in one point, in a <hi>Unity</hi> of Life? Hast thou lookt on all Things <hi>at once,</hi> and
seen them in a <hi>Harmony</hi> of Beauty? Hast thou taken in the Tunes and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of all Things Created and Uncreated in a <hi>Concent</hi> of Pleasures? Didst
thou ever yet descry a glorious <hi>Eternity</hi> in each winged <hi>Moment</hi> of Time; a
Bright <hi>Infiniteness</hi> in the narrow <hi>points</hi> of every dark Object? Then thou
knowest what the <hi>Spirit</hi> means, that <hi>Spire-top</hi> of Things, whither all ascend
harmoniously, where they meet, and sit together <hi>recollected,</hi> and <hi>concentred</hi> in
an Unfathom'd Depth of Glorious Life. From hence thou lookest down, and
seest all <hi>Flesh,</hi> as a heap of <hi>Single Dusts; Dark,</hi> though falling from the midst
of a bright Flame; <hi>Divided,</hi> though laid together.</p>
            <p>He that knows no <hi>Spirit,</hi> but that which breaths thorow Flesh, and feeds
on the Air. He that understands the highest <hi>Spirit,</hi> but as a Fleshly <hi>Fancy</hi>
exalted; is yet <hi>Flesh,</hi> condemn'd like <hi>Nebucchadnezzar</hi> to graze on the fading
Field of Flesh, till he know, this <hi>Flesh</hi> to be that <hi>Darkness,</hi> which covers all
Truth; and the most high <hi>Spirit,</hi> to be the only Light, which discovers all
things, and itself.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Discovery, Have I seen a Night upon this World?</hi> One <hi>Day</hi> passeth not
away for another to succeed, except a <hi>Night</hi> come between. My soul is not
yet born again out of the Light of this World into the <hi>Day</hi> of Christ, if she
hath not gone thorow a <hi>Night,</hi> a Night of Eternal Darkness upon all Earthly
Contents. Thou canst not look down upon Fleshly Things with a Delight,
from the <hi>Throne</hi> of Christ; except thou hast lookt upon them, as a Prospect
of Horrour; from the <hi>Cross</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49838:26"/>
               <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> threatens <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and her Companions, to throw her into a
<hi>Bed,</hi> and great <hi>Tribulation:</hi> Revel. 2. 22. He never comes into the <hi>Bed of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Repose</hi> with <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as his <hi>Spouse;</hi> that hath not been in a <hi>Bed of afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,</hi>
and Flames, with his <hi>Jezabel</hi> the <hi>Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Discovery. Have I tasted the Sweetness of a Life within, in my own
Spirit?</hi> Hast thou not made a <hi>Retreat</hi> into thine own Depths? Hast thou not
seen the Beauties, that shine in <hi>this Glass?</hi> Then art thou far from the Depths
of the Divine Spirit, and the Glories that disclose themselves in <hi>that Glass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov. 20. 27. That the Spirit of Man is the Candle of the
Lord in his Bowels:</hi> if the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Man within be but a <hi>Candle;</hi> what
then is this <hi>Sensual State</hi> without? Neither Life, nor Death; nor Light, nor
Darkness: but <hi>Shadows</hi> of Life, and Death between both. But who can think
he hath receiv'd the <hi>Beams</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> when yet he hath not seen a <hi>Candles
Light?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read of a <hi>Strumpet,</hi> Prov. 7. 11, 12. <hi>That her Feet abide not in the
house; but she loves to be abroad.</hi> While the Feet, the Affections of our Souls
are ever gadding and our eyes gazing in the broad ways of <hi>Sense;</hi> while they
love not to dwell in the <hi>Habitation</hi> of their <hi>own Spirits;</hi> they make themselves
<hi>Strumpets</hi> to every unclean Spirit.</p>
            <p>I have ended the <hi>First Head</hi> of this Doctrine, the <hi>Conversion,</hi> or <hi>Change</hi> it
self. I am now to pass to the <hi>Second,</hi> the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of this Change.</p>

            <p>1. <hi>Order of Passions</hi> in our Change.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Passion: Grief.</hi> John 12. 32, 33. <hi>And I, if I be lifted up, will draw
up all men after me. This he spake, signifying, by what Death he should die.</hi> The
Explication of the <hi>Exaltation,</hi> the <hi>lifting up,</hi> the <hi>drawing up,</hi> is <hi>Death.</hi> The
Lord <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sus</hi> was lifted up to Glory <hi>by Death.</hi> He draws up all men to himself,
and Immortality, <hi>by Death, Grief</hi> is the Souls Death. God by this for the most
part begins to draw us up, out of Sin, and Flesh to himself, and eternal joys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grief naturally</hi> is the <hi>Sense of some Great, and Present Evil oppressing the
Soul.</hi> Grief <hi>Spiritually</hi> is the Sense of some Great, and Present Evil <hi>oppressing</hi>
the Soul, and <hi>pressing</hi> it thorow itself into the lap of the Godhead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psal. 119. 67. David</hi> communicates his Experience: <hi>Before I was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49838:27"/>
I went astray: but now I keep thy Commandments.</hi> The word <hi>afflicted</hi>
signifies to be <hi>brought low,</hi> or <hi>down.</hi> When the Soul gone forth into the midst
of the Creatures is arrived at the utmost point of one <hi>Contrary,</hi> then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to return towards the other: as the Sun first turns itself towards us again
at Midnight. The utmost Point of a worldly life in Sin, and Vanity, is <hi>Grief,</hi>
or Torment taking away all our Rest. The Soul hurried hither by the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of her lusts, here begins to look, and move towards God. So the <hi>Grave</hi>
of our joys, our <hi>Grief</hi> becomes a <hi>Womb</hi> bringing us forth to a Spiritual life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 2. David speaks of God, and himself: <hi>He hath drawn me up out
of the Horrible Pit, and Dirty Clay.</hi> This world hath a <hi>Root</hi> of Darkness,
which bears for a <hi>Flower</hi> the <hi>Images of Light.</hi> When the Spirit of Man lives
upon, and makes itself One with these <hi>Imaginary</hi> Pleasures; they quickly fade:
So both together sink down into their <hi>Root,</hi> where they are swallowed up in
a melancholy darkness. Here the Vanities, which before were Light, now
grow heavy, weighing down the Soul. Here all her former Contents meet
her again, as <hi>Parts,</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> of this Darkness. That, which was before
<hi>beautiful Clay, soft Clay,</hi> easie to any Impression of Desire, is now <hi>stiff, and
dirty Clay,</hi> holding the feet of the Soul fast in the bottom of this <hi>Horrible Pit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now God takes hold of us thus low, thus lost, and draws us upward. So
our Change begins in <hi>Grief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Passion: Shame.</hi> Es. 6. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Shame</hi> ariseth from a <hi>Mixt sense</hi>
of Light, and Darkness; Good, and Evil; Beauty, and Deformity. It is a
<hi>mixt Passion</hi> of Grief, Anger, Fear. As when the Light, and Day first sink
into Night, and Darkness in the Evening; or first ascend out of these in the
Morning, the Sky looks red: So the Soul blusheth in the midst of her Sins,
and is <hi>ashamed,</hi> when God first <hi>dawnes</hi> upon her, and begins to draw near to
her.</p>
            <p>Ezek. 43. 10. Son of man, shew them the House that they may be ashamed
of all their Iniquities, and let them measure the Pattern. Shame <hi>is a</hi> Reflection of
foul, and hateful Deformities, made upon our Spirits by the Light of Beauty, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
God shining forth upon them. Shame <hi>is the Divine Glory glowing thorow
our Darkness, and Filth; before yet it is broken forth into a clear Flame to
scatter, and consume them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God saith to</hi> Iesus Christ, <hi>of man:</hi> Son, go and shew thy self to him, as the
Image, in which he was made, in which he should have lived. So let him be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of that dark, narrow, vile, brutish Image, in which he walks. Let him
take measure by Thee, as his Original and Pattern.</p>
            <p>3. Passion: Fear. <hi>As</hi> Grief awakens Shame, <hi>so</hi> Shame rowseth Fear <hi>out of
its Den.</hi> Psal. 119. 120. David cries out: My Flesh trembleth because of
Thee: I am afraid of thy Iudgments. Fear <hi>is the</hi> Commotion of the Soul, upon
the sense of some approaching Evil. <hi>As the Sea trembles before a Storm: So at
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49838:27"/>
the sign of God's breaking forth upon the Soul, the fleshly part trembles, and
shakes before its fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Man himself is afraid of the <hi>Judgments</hi> of God; the ways of God
with the Creature. The Devils at the Presence of Christ feared <hi>two Things:</hi>
1. A <hi>Banishment</hi> from off the Face of the Earth. 2. A <hi>Confinement</hi> to the
Lower-most parts of the Earth. Such now is the Fear of a Man, lest he should
be <hi>call'd off</hi> from his Carnal Contents, and <hi>cast down</hi> into the Straitness, and
Horrour of his Carnal Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He discourseth with himself thus:</hi> Must not I, who have lived in Flesh, now
be separated from all the delights of Flesh, and be shut up in the Darkness of it? Must
I not abide there, till I have pass'd thorow the Fire, and endur'd the Consumption
of all that which is Corruptible in me? The longer I live in the Flesh, will not
the Fire be the stronger?</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Fear</hi> becomes a <hi>Spur</hi> in the side of the Spirit to increase her speed out
of the World, to God. This is the <hi>First Order of Passions: Grief, Shame, Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Order of Passions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Passion: Hope.</hi> Lament. 3. 21, 22. <hi>This I call to mind, therefore have
I hope: It is the mercies of the Lord, that we are not consumed. Hope</hi> is the
<hi>Springing of the Soul towards good, or God, first dawning upon it, and dispensing
Himself to it. Jeremy,</hi> was all before wrapt up in Sorrows, Despairs, Death:
Now one single Beam of <hi>Hope,</hi> and that a small one, glimmers in his Soul: <hi>It
is the mercies of the Lord, that we are not consumed.</hi> Yet this lights him into
fresh Fields of Contemplations, and Consolations in God.</p>
            <p>There is Mercy with thee, that thou mayst be feared: <hi>saith the</hi> Scripture <hi>to
God. When</hi> Fear <hi>affrights the fainting Soul from God:</hi> Hope <hi>invites it to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
that</hi> Fear. Fear <hi>saith:</hi> The Presence of God will take away thy Natural
Strength, and Ioy. Hope <hi>answers:</hi> I shall find a better Strength, and Ioy in God.
Fear <hi>goes on:</hi> The Glory of God will be, as a Fire in thee. Hope <hi>replies:</hi> This
Fire will be a Glory to me. Fear <hi>still urgeth:</hi> Canst thou ly down with Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Burnings? Hope <hi>concludes:</hi> I shall have everlasting Arms beneath me. <hi>So
the Soul casts her self into these</hi> Arms <hi>to be</hi> carried, <hi>whithersoever they will</hi>
bear <hi>her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Passion: Desire.</hi> 2. Sam. 7. 27. David thus conveys his <hi>Desires</hi> to God:
<hi>Because thou O lord, hast revealed it to thy Servant concerning his House: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath he found in his heart to pray this prayer. Hope</hi> is the <hi>Conception</hi> of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness.
<hi>Desire</hi> is the <hi>Teeming,</hi> the Breeding, Bearing, and Growing big with
it, till it be brought forth. The Vestal Virgins first kindled their Spark by a
Beam: then they from that Spark kept a continual Flame upon their Altar.
So the <hi>Revelation</hi> of God in Man is the Foundation of <hi>Hope: Hope</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of <hi>Desires,</hi> which grow into great Streams, and so pour forth themselves
into their Sea, into God again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49838:28"/>
The <hi>Desires</hi> of a New Convert, when once they are kindled, increase sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
to a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghty Flame. For they are <hi>proportion'd</hi> by <hi>Two things:</hi> The
<hi>Good,</hi> at which he aims: The <hi>Evil,</hi> from which he flies. <hi>Desires</hi> here are the
<hi>Attractions</hi> of the highest Good, the most high God: backed by the <hi>Impressions</hi>
of the greatest Evils, Sin, Death, Devils. As <hi>one</hi> draws; the <hi>Other</hi> drive. The
Soul sees God <hi>before</hi> her opening a World of new Hopes, and Delights. She
sees Lusts and Furies <hi>behind</hi> her, labouring to overtake her, and hold her back
from those fresh Glories, which are now in her eye. This makes her <hi>Desires,</hi>
as swift feet, as strong Wings to her.</p>
            <p>Now the newly-converted Spirit begins to discover her self by continual,
violent Breathings, and cries towards Heaven: <hi>How long Lord?</hi> Now she
speaks in <hi>Davids</hi> tune, and tone <hi>Psal. 84. 2. My soul longeth, yea even fainteth
for the Courts of the Lord: my Heart, and my Flesh cry out for the Living God.</hi>
Grones are now the constant beatings of the Heart; Longings and Faintings
become the Language of all parts inward, and outward: Longings after,
Faintings for, the Life of God, the Living God.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Passion: Rage.</hi> 2. Corin. 7. 11. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> had slept secure in a
foul Sin. They now awakened by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> give those Testimonies of their
<hi>Change,</hi> which he reckons up in this place: <hi>What vehement Desire: yea, what
Zeal? yea, what Revenge?</hi> As a Flood fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Anger, or <hi>Rage, Desires multiplied, and growing Mighty by Resistance.</hi>
            </p>

poyson of Desires and Delights into the Heart, which kill Heavenly Loves,
which infect the Heart with hatred, and enmity against God and his Glory,
<hi>James 4. 4. The Friendship of the World is enmity with God.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> is
<hi>like a Lyon, seeking whom he may d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our Souls into himself out of the Arms of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>World</hi> works upon us thorow the <hi>Flesh</hi> in our selves. For this is the
<hi>Property,</hi> and the Birth of the <hi>World</hi> in us, <hi>John 8. 23. Ye are of the World:
Ye,</hi> that is they that are Fleshly. The <hi>Devil</hi> prevaileth upon us by the <hi>World.</hi>
This is the <hi>Body</hi> with which he cloaths himself, when he comes, he is <hi>Prince of
this World.</hi> This world is his <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>God, Christ,</hi> and a <hi>Saint</hi> are all united in the <hi>Spiritual part</hi> of a Christian:
So the <hi>Devil,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi> are all in one, in the <hi>Natural part.</hi> These
the Soul at her <hi>Conversion</hi> now understands to be, the Enemies of her Hope,
the Tyrants over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>joy, the Rubs in the way of her Desires. She riseth to a
brave heat of Rage, and height of Revenge against these. Thus she vents
her Rage, thus she takes Revenge. By fastning her own <hi>Flesh</hi> to the Cross <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Hatred. Hatred <hi>is the</hi> Life of Contrariety, Casting out <hi>from itself, yet</hi> Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
in <hi>it self, as in a Chain,</hi> Conquering to <hi>it self, its Contrary. God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth</hi>
Christ <hi>thus much:</hi> Psal. 110. 1, Sit thou at my right hand, till I make
thine enemies thy Foot-stool. <hi>We hold our</hi> Foot-stool near <hi>us, but</hi>
under <hi>us. We
hold it</hi> down, <hi>yet we hold</hi> up, <hi>and raise our selves by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Twofold Hatred.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Hatred before Love.</item>
               <item>2. Hatred from Love.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Hatred before Love</hi> is weak, and imperfect, rellishing much, of <hi>self-love,</hi>
Darkness, and Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:49838:29"/>
               <hi>Hatred from Love is Perfect,</hi> it springs from the Heart of sweetness, it sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinates
itself to it, it ends in it. The Life of this Hatred is Love.</p>
            <p>As the soul at her first Conversion is strong in Love, so is she sweet in her
Hatred. She hates <hi>perfectly</hi> like a <hi>God,</hi> not a <hi>Devil,</hi> every thing, which brings
not the Loveliness of her Saviour along with it, as a Pass-port: She turns
away her face from it, she sets her feet upon it: not suffering it to rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Life of the Lord Jesus within her: forcing it to serve his <hi>Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for the <hi>Third Order of Passions, Love, Hatred.</hi> So much for the
<hi>First Circumstance</hi> in our Conversion: <hi>The Universal Motion in our Passions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Circumstance: A General Alteration in Practice. <hi>This</hi> Alteration is Twofold:</p>
            <p>1. A Manifest withdrawing from all Companies, and Contents, that draw
the Soul outward, or downward.</p>
            <p>2. An eminent Delight in all Persons, and Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hs, that draw the Spirit inward,
or upward.</p>
            <p>David <hi>expresseth both these in himself:</hi> Psal. 16. My delight is in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
of the Earth. As for them, that go after other Gods, I will not make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Name.</p>
            <p>1. Use: <hi>For</hi> Discovery. Religion <hi>is no</hi> empty Name, <hi>but a</hi> Real Thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Two
Things <hi>make a</hi> Reality <hi>in the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Object.</item>
               <item>2. The Inward Affections.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>The Object.</hi> As the <hi>Woman</hi> is to the <hi>Man</hi> his <hi>Image,</hi> his Glory in the
Image: So is the <hi>Soul</hi> to her <hi>Object.</hi> If she espouse her self to the Lying Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this World, she makes her self one with them, both <hi>Vanity,</hi> and a <hi>Lye.</hi>
If she cleave to the Rock of Ages, the Rock of the Godhead, growing to
that, growing up out of that, she becomes a <hi>Living Stone,</hi> a <hi>Rock</hi> of Eternity
in her self.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Motion</hi> in Religion, the winding of the Soul about the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
point of the Creature, and turning in towards God again. This is the
Discriminating, Dividing Temper; between Religious and unregenerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
the <hi>Touching</hi> of the Soul with God, as the <hi>Needle</hi> is touch't with the
Load-stone; when it may have various agitations, yet it feels the Impressions of
God in the midst of all: when it can never establish, or quiet itself in any post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
save then only, when it is pointed on God. <hi>My Soul hath said to the Lord, thou
art my Portion:</hi> Lamen. 3.</p>
            <p>Psal. 16. 8. <hi>I have set the Lord always before me: He is at my Right hand: I
shall not be moved. God is our Assistant there, where he is</hi> our <hi>Object:</hi> at our <hi>Hand,</hi>
if he be in our <hi>Eye.</hi> This is the Life and Essence of Religion; the exaltation
of God in our Spirits, as our <hi>Chief Object, to</hi> which, and <hi>by</hi> which we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
            <p>Examine thy self, by this. If the world be all to thee, and God a Fancy:
then art thou like that world, a <hi>Fancy,</hi> and a <hi>Bubble.</hi> If God be all to thee,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49838:29"/>
and the world a Dream: then thou hast Strength, Life, and Substance. For
thou art one with him, who is the Life, Strength, Substance, Being of all things.</p>
            <p>Is thy Heart, as a <hi>Hearth,</hi> on which Thorns only blaze? Are the workings
of thy Spirit like thin, and fine Smoak, slight and vanishing? Can then there
be any <hi>Religion,</hi> where there is no <hi>Reality?</hi> He is the Religious man who graspes
<hi>Substance;</hi> who digs thorow all things, till he meets with a sure <hi>Foundation;</hi>
who hath taken hold of something Solid, Satisfactory, Everlasting at which
his Soul stops, on which she stays her self. <hi>I hate them, saith</hi> David, <hi>that look to
lying Vanities: but my trust is in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Three-fold Sense</hi> of things, which makes a <hi>Religious</hi> man <hi>Real:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Sense, of this World's sorrows.</item>

            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sense, of this World's sorrows.</hi> No man is in the Spirit of Christ, who
hath not been at the Cross, in the Grave of Christ, and there seen the end of
all this world's Glories. Who beholds things in the Eternal Light? He, that
hath first seen this world in a Fire, out of which it falls into blackness of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
<hi>By the Cross of Christ, the World is crucified to me;</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul. I come
to kindle a Fire in the World,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>and what will I, if it be already
Kindled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They that go down into the Deep, see the Wonders of the Lord:</hi> saith the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist.
Whoever is gone up to Heights of Grace, hath gone down into the
Deep of the First Creation, and seen Wonders of Darkness there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jonah</hi> tells us of himself: <hi>Jon. 2, 6. I went down to the bottom of the Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
the bars of the Earth were about me for ever.</hi> Hast thou descended with
thy Saviour to the <hi>Bottom</hi> of this Creation, hast thou seen about thee those
everlasting <hi>Bars</hi> of Darkness, which bear up, and bound this Creation? Then
shew us the effect, which <hi>Solomon</hi> mentions in <hi>Ecclesiastes: A sad Countenance
makes a good Heart.</hi> As Darkness contracts the Eye, unites the Fancy, and
makes it strong: So a sad Face of things makes the Spirit gather up itself into
itself, live serious, and Recollected.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Sense, of Divine Wrath. We,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, knowing the Terrours of the
Lord, persuade men:</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 11, If we know God, we know his <hi>Terrours,</hi>
and what the <hi>Power of his Wrath</hi> is; can we not then persuade our selves to
be serious? Have you seen the Treasures of wrath laid up with God for those
that harden their Hearts in Sloth, and Sense, to an <hi>insensibleness</hi> of Spiritual,
and Eternal things? Have you heard those seven-times-seven fold increases of
Fury upon those, who go on in Vanity; and yet say, it shall not be so, it shall
be well with them? Cannot these things make you <hi>Real,</hi> and <hi>Sober?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If still vanity be your Life, your Food, your Joy; if still Lightness be your
Air, and Shadows the Game, which you hunt with your Reason, and Senses;
then fear, lest you have seen Shadows only of these Objects, lest your <hi>Religion</hi>
too be <hi>vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49838:30"/>
3. <hi>Sense of Divine Love.</hi> The Scripture saith in one place to good men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>The Joy of the Lord shall be your Strength.</hi> Such as the <hi>Nourishment</hi> of our
Spirit is, such will its <hi>Constitution,</hi> and our Conversation be. If our Food, our
Joy be Divine, and we eat the Bread of Angels, our Lives will be Divine, and
our Faces shine with Angelical Beams. If our Delights be Vanity, and we
feed on wind; our Spirits, and Conversation will be windy.</p>
            <p>The same <hi>Solomon, that said of Mirth, what dost thou? And of Laughter, it
is Madness:</hi> Eccles. 2. 2. He saith <hi>Prov. 3. The ways of Wisdom are ways of
Peace, and all her Paths are pleasantness.</hi> Spiritual Pleasures are Serious ones, as
Grave, as Wisdom itself: for they are <hi>her Walks. The Love of Christ constrains
us:</hi> saith St. Paul, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. The Love of Christ <hi>holds in, binds up,</hi> and <hi>unites</hi>
the Spirit, not suffering it to pour forth itself loosely.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Liberty,</hi> which is Daughter to Divine Love, what a Stranger is it to
<hi>Licentiousness?</hi> Those Sweetnesses, which flow from God and his Glories how
do they look down upon, and despise <hi>Empty Mirths,</hi> and mad Laughters? A
Bride, made a Woman of a Cat, and set among the Guests in the bridal Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
on a sudden runs after a Mouse which stir'd in a Corner of the Room. If
thy Soul be still ready to fly at every vanity, which is at any time started in
the eye of it: thou maist be cloth'd with the Form of a Heavenly Bride; but
sure thou hast still a Brutish Spirit.</p>
            <p>Thus you see, how the <hi>Object</hi> of a <hi>Religious</hi> man makes him <hi>Real.</hi> The <hi>Second
Reality</hi> in Religion is that of <hi>Inward Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Inward Affections. My Son,</hi> saith Wisdom in the <hi>Proverbs, give me
thy Heart.</hi> Perhaps you give to God your <hi>Feet</hi> to carry you to Sermons; you
give him your <hi>Hands</hi> to work, or fight for him; you give him your <hi>Tongue</hi> to
discourse of Him: but have you given him your <hi>Heart?</hi> Doth that cleave to
him, long and pant after him, sigh for him, live only in Him? <hi>David</hi> saith to
God: <hi>Ps<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l 51. Thou lovest Uprightness in the Inward parts.</hi> The more <hi>Inward</hi>
any thing is, the more <hi>Upright</hi> it is. Are thy frequentest Groans such, as thou
dost not express, thou canst not express; such, as thy Spirit only feels, God's
Spirit only hears?</p>
            <p>It is the Counsel of our Lord Jesus: <hi>Pray to thy Father in Secret, and He
shall reward thee openly.</hi> The most <hi>Secret</hi> things are the most <hi>Serious.</hi> Dost thou
commune with thine own Heart upon thy Bed about the things of God, and
Eternity? Do the workings and Labourings of thy Soul after thy Saviour
hold thine eyes waking, while others are sleeping?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us: <hi>The Heart knoweth its own Sorrow, and a stranger intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
not with its Joys.</hi> Blessed is he who hath a sense of a Sorrow for Sin, and
the absence of God, which his own Heart only is conscious to. Blessed is he,
who lives on hidden Manna, who hath his Bosom still warmed with a secret
Flame of Divine Love, and Joy, to which all others are Strangers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49838:30"/>
Man hath, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, a <hi>Spirit,</hi> a <hi>Soul,</hi> a <hi>Body.</hi> So hath <hi>Religion. God</hi>
the Eternal Object and Spring of our Religion is the <hi>Spirit:</hi> our <hi>Inward Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
are the <hi>Soul;</hi> our <hi>outward Actions, the Body. Outward</hi> Actions most
glorious, if they go alone, make but a <hi>Dead Religion,</hi> are a <hi>Body</hi> without a Soul.
<hi>Inward Affections</hi> without God make but a <hi>Brutish Religion,</hi> a Soul in a Body
without the Immortal Spirit. I now conclude this Application.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Use: For Direction,</hi> I will divide this into a <hi>Threefold Direction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Direction. Entertain mournful Tempers as Angels; Improve them as Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi>
When <hi>Jonah</hi> was in the bottom of the Sea, and belly of the Fish, his
Soul fainting within him; then he remembred the Lord; <hi>Jonah</hi> 2. 7. As
Pearls are found at the bottom of the Sea: so, frequently do the Beauties of
the Lord Jesus disclose themselves to us in the depths of Grief, when we are
sunk below the waters of this world, and are swallowed up into a Spirit of
Darkness. It is St. <hi>James</hi>'s advice, <hi>Jam. 1 4. Let Patience have its perfect
work, and it shall make you perfect.</hi> As one Element stretcht to the utmost pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
into another, Water into Air, Air into Fire: as a Cloud big, and swelling
dissolves it self upon the Earth: so thy Griefs, if thou wait calmly upon them,
as they swell, and grow, will at length dissolve themselves into God. As Snow
and Frost cherish the Seed in the ground: so do biting and binding Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
both kill the weeds of Vanity, and ripen the Seed of Divinity in Man. I
can no more want Sorrows for my Soul, than the Husband-man can want <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
seasons</hi> for his Corn fields. As natural Melancholy draws the Soul deeply
into her self, and her Divinest Principles; whence she issues forth again, with
the most great and glorious Lights: so do sad things work upon a holy Spirit
sinking her thorow her self into the Depths of the Godhead, out of which she
riseth renewed to a fresh Spring of Life and Joy.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Direction. Look stedfastly to the end of all Flesh.</hi> In every Pleasure, Strength,
Glory, see the Worm, and the Fire which is bred in all fleshly things, the one
never to go out, the other never to die till Flesh be no more. <hi>The belly for meats,
and meat for the belly; but God shall destroy them both; and I will be in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to neither,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> If thou engage thy Soul in any earthly Content,
thou puttest thy self into a Prison, whence you must come by Death, or where
Death will find you. Why should I <hi>put on</hi> that, which I must <hi>keep on</hi> with
lasting vexations, or <hi>put off</hi> with present Pains? The world and my senses were
made one for another. The Devil hath defiled, and disordered both: God

               </gap> neither.</p>
            <p>3. Direction. Preserve Hope towards God ever alive in thy self, <hi>Hos. 2. 15.
We read of the</hi> Door of Hope. Hope <hi>is the</hi> Door <hi>of Happiness. This admits us
into the Godhead. He that suffers</hi> Hope <hi>to sink under Despair in his Spirit,
locks and bars up the</hi> Door <hi>of Heaven against himself.</hi> Prov. 13. 12. Hope
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49838:31"/>
deferr'd makes the heart sick. <hi>But</hi> Hope <hi>cut off</hi> kills the <hi>Heart, and makes it
lie dead in Sin, and Flesh.</hi> He will lay his mouth in the Dust, if there may be
Hope, <hi>Give a man</hi> Hope, <hi>and you cast the Seed of a New Soul, of God into
him.</hi> What? <hi>saith one,</hi> May I, the vilest of men, the lowest of creatures, hope to
be pardoned? Nay more, to be loved? to be made partaker of a Divine Spirit,
and Glory? May I thus l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st, hope this? Then will I fear, worship, serve God, do,
suffer any thing for him, or from him; I will lay my mouth in the Dust at his feet,
if I may have Hope. <hi>Hope declares the most right, and most sweet thoughts
of God. It sets the Soul in the rightest and sweetest frame towards God. He
exalts God, and gives him the highest Glory, that dares at</hi> worst, <hi>to</hi> hope <hi>for
the</hi> best <hi>things from him.</hi> He that praiseth me, he honoureth me, <hi>saith God,</hi> Psal.
50. There are <hi>Two Grounds</hi> for Hope, <hi>which never fail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>God is nigh thee, Acts</hi> 15. Thou hast <hi>thy Being in him.</hi> Thou wer't
made by Jesus Christ, thou subsistest in him, as in thy <hi>Root.</hi> Thou art the
work of his hand; the Son of his <hi>Handmaid, Nature.</hi> Thy <hi>Natural Being</hi> is
a putting forth, a manifestation of Christ. Wait alwaies in Hope, for his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and divinest manifestations, which come after this. Thine eyes shall see
them, if thou let not go thy <hi>Hope,</hi> but wait con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idently to the end.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>God is Infinite.</hi> He is All: All that thou canst <hi>think</hi> or <hi>wish.</hi> For thou
couldst not <hi>think,</hi> or <hi>wish</hi> any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if it were not first in him. He is beyond
thy <hi>Distresses</hi> or <hi>Desires.</hi> Hope then ever in this God, who is already <hi>in thee,</hi>
who is <hi>Infinite,</hi> whose <hi>Power</hi> is above all thy <hi>Pressures,</hi> whose <hi>Love</hi> is above
his own <hi>Wrath. Christ</hi> is called <hi>our Hope: Christ in you the Hope of Glory:</hi>
to signifie, that <hi>Hope</hi> is the Son of God, and his Image growing in us; that
Hope should have no <hi>Ground,</hi> but Christ; and then be as its Ground; <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,

1. Cause: The Relation of God to Man. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 5. There is one God. <hi>All
Mankind, all creatures are gathered up into one point of Life, which is</hi> Love,
<hi>the</hi> Unity <hi>of Life,</hi> in God. There is one God, the Father of all, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God is a</hi> Father <hi>in</hi> Fulness, <hi>in</hi> Sweetness.</p>
            <p>1. God is a Father in Fulness, <hi>Luk. 20. 38. Our Saviour speaks thus of God:</hi>
He is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living. For all live to God: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
All things live to God. <hi>After the same manner, with the same force you may
reason thus: God is not the God of the</hi> Dead, <hi>but the living; of the</hi> unclean,
<hi>but the</hi> pure; <hi>of the</hi> imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rfect, <hi>but the</hi> perfect; <hi>of the</hi> miserable, <hi>but the</hi> happy;
<hi>of the</hi> fading, <hi>but the</hi> eternal. <hi>For all things are</hi> living, pure, perfect, happy,
eternal, <hi>to God. So all things have</hi> pure, happy, eternal lives <hi>in God. These
are the</hi> Original <hi>and</hi> Radical Lives; <hi>the</hi> First, <hi>the</hi> Fairest Seeds <hi>of all things
in the Divine Nature. Thus God is</hi> All. <hi>This is the</hi> Fulness <hi>of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. God <hi>is a Father in Sweetness. God is Love,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 16. God is Love
in the <hi>Fountain.</hi> As waters in their Spring, so is Love in God. It makes him
flow <hi>into</hi> creatures, it makes him flow forth in Love <hi>upon</hi> the creatures; and
still he pursues, he chaseth one Love with another in a <hi>Stream,</hi> till all return
to their Original. Thus, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> Speaketh, <hi>Rom. 11. 36. All things are
from him, thorow him, and to him, From</hi> him. as the <hi>Fountain</hi> of Love; <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> him, as the <hi>Stream</hi> of Love; <hi>to</hi> him, as the <hi>Sea</hi> of Love. <hi>All Cattel are
mine upon a thousand bills,</hi> saith God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 10. As a Father looks upon
his Children, as his own, as Images, parts of himself, himself multiplied: So is
God a <hi>Father in Sweetness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These two, the <hi>Fulness,</hi> the <hi>Sweetness</hi> of God, as a <hi>Father,</hi> are the <hi>First
Ground</hi> of <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Happiness</hi> to the creature. The <hi>Fulness</hi> is that
which we call the <hi>All-sufficiency</hi> of God; the <hi>Sweetness</hi> is that which we call
<hi>Free Grace.</hi> These are the <hi>Two Pillars</hi> in the Temple of Glory: <hi>Booz (strength)</hi>
Jakin, <hi>(He will prepare.)</hi> The <hi>Fulness</hi> of God is one, <hi>Sweetness</hi> the other.</p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Our Lord Jesus is a Divine Head to the Soul,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 3. <hi>The Head
of every man is Christ.</hi> This is the difference between <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ; God</hi> contains eternally all the creatures in one <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person</hi> in himself. <hi>God
is One. Jesus Christ</hi> comprehends the creature in one <hi>Person,</hi> not <hi>Nature,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with himself. Therefore as in one place he is said to be the <hi>Head of
Man,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 3. So in another place he is called the <hi>Man, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
            <p>Our Blessed Saviour is God uniting the different <hi>Natures</hi> of God, and the
<hi>Creature</hi> in One <hi>Person,</hi> and that his <hi>Own</hi> Person. From this <hi>Person</hi> he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
the Being of the creature, and streams forth immediately into it, in a
different <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Person.</hi> In this <hi>Person.</hi> he holds the creature in its proper
and distinct Being, by being annext and united to himself. Thus the Lord
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49838:32"/>
is a <hi>Head to Man.</hi> And as the <hi>Head</hi> puts a beauty upon the Whole Body, so
doth Jesus Christ upon the whole Creation, by making himself a Head to it.</p>
            <p>2. Our Lord Iesus is a Divine Seed in the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3. 16. 19. till the Seed came: <hi>He is</hi> the Seed of the Woman, <hi>Gen. 3. 15. But
what</hi> Woman <hi>is this? He is the Seed of the</hi> Earthly Woman, Eve. <hi>For he lies
hid in her, as in a Womb. He groweth up out of her in the Virgin</hi> Mary,
<hi>clothing himself with her Flesh. But there is another</hi> Woman <hi>besides this,
which is a</hi> Mother, <hi>and hath her</hi> Seed; <hi>a</hi> heavenly Mother <hi>of a heavenly Seed.
St.</hi> Paul <hi>makes mention of her,</hi> Gal. 4. 26. The <hi>Hierusalem</hi> above is free,
which is the Mother of us all. <hi>Jesus Christ is a</hi> Seed. <hi>God is the</hi> Father, <hi>this
heavenly Woman is the</hi> Mother, <hi>the Spiritual State of the creature. He derives
himself from</hi> both these. <hi>He unites</hi> both these <hi>in himself. So he lies in the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
Woman, <hi>the fleshly Image, and becomes</hi> her Seed <hi>in the second place; a</hi>
Seed thrice over, bearing h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>As every creature hath this <hi>Seed</hi> in it, so it hath lying hid in it the Eternal
Beauty of the Divine Nature, the Immortal Beauty of the Spiritual Creature,
which both are wrapt up together, in this <hi>Seed,</hi> to grow up together out of
it <hi>in their Season.</hi> Thus our Saviour is a <hi>Divine Seed in the Soul.</hi>

               <hi>But</hi> what is Truth? <hi>said</hi> Pilate <hi>to</hi> Christ. Christ <hi>had often said of</hi> himself;
I am the Truth. <hi>We read of</hi> him, Rev. 1. 5. <hi>that he is the</hi> Faithful Witness,
<hi>And he is said to</hi> reveal the Father: No man knows who the Son is, but the
Father. No man knows who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son
will reveal him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> First Truth in General and particular, <hi>is the</hi> Life of God, <hi>and the</hi> Life
of the Creature in God. <hi>Jesus Christ is</hi> Truth, <hi>as he is a</hi> True Discovery <hi>of this</hi>
Truth. <hi>He</hi> reveals the Father, that is, <hi>he opens the bosom of God; he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests

the Life of the Creature, as it abides in the Life of God, and grows upon

Truth in Man?</hi> No man can come unto me, except the Father draw him, saith <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> Ioh. 6. 44. To come to the Truth; <hi>to</hi> have the Truth manifested in us

it, It hath also an</hi> Image, <hi>which grows up out of it. Jesus Christ is the</hi> Seed
<hi>in the Soul of Man; the</hi> Father <hi>is the</hi> Power; <hi>the</hi> Son <hi>is the</hi> Image <hi>in this Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When a <hi>Corn</hi> is cast into the ground, a <hi>Power</hi> goes forth from it into the
<hi>Earth</hi> round about, which attracts, and draws it; which unites, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
it with the <hi>Seed,</hi> which sends it forth again in the <hi>Form</hi> of that <hi>Plant,</hi>

Christ</hi> diffuseth himself into the whole <hi>Soul, draws</hi> it into <hi>Christ,</hi> who lies
there as a <hi>Seed,</hi> makes it One with him, who <hi>brings</hi> it forth again into his own
<hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Fruit.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>Jam. 1. 18. Of his own Will beg at be us by
the Word of Truth.</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> is the <hi>Seed</hi> of Truth, <hi>Christ, Jesus</hi> in us.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Will</hi> of God is composed of those <hi>two</hi> forementioned; <hi>A Supream
Fulness, a Soveraign Sweetness:</hi> These powerfully and pleasantly stir up the
<hi>Godhead</hi> to bring forth the creatures, and to bring forth it self in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
These delightfully and effectually move God to propagate himself
endlesly and infinitely. These heats of love, the delights of fruitfulness are
the inward and only Motives which put on our heavenly Father to quicken
his Seed in us, to make it grow up by degree, till it hath perfectly brought
forth it self into its own form and fulness.</p>
            <p>Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Gal. 1. 16. It pleased the Father to reveal his Son in
him.</hi> As the Sun draws up the Plants out of their Roots, and discovers them
to the open Air; so the Father reveals and discloseth Jesus Christ in the Soul.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Cause:</hi> The Ministry of Man to Man; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. We read that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
are made <hi>Ministring Spirits for the good of those that are to inherit Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
So it pleaseth God often to make men as Angels, to minister Spiritual
things to their Brethren.</p>
            <p>It is one of the Mysteries of Godliness, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. God manifested in the
Flesh, justified in the Spirit.</hi> The great God is pleased by the <hi>Fleshly</hi> waies of
man's <hi>doing, speaking, writing, reading, living,</hi> to express and convey himself.</p>
            <p>A Learned man admires it, as having a Height of Wonder in it, that so
low, so narrow; so dark, dead, divided things, as <hi>words,</hi> and <hi>letters</hi> should car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Earthly man, as <hi>scattered Dust,</hi> and by the <hi>Motions</hi> of this Dust in words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants

            <p>There is a <hi>Three-fold Ministry</hi> of Man by which God works in the <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of men:
<list>
                  <item>1. Elevation of the heart in Prayer to God.</item>
                  <item>2. Exhortation by words to men.</item>
                  <item>3. Example of life before men.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Elevation of the heart in Prayer to God for men.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> describes Prayer,
<hi>Rom. 8. 27. God heareth His Spirit, for it makes intercessions in us, according to
his will. Prayer</hi> is the <hi>Conception</hi> of the Soul, when it hath taken in from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Form</hi> of some Divine <hi>Blessing:</hi> Then it grows big with
this <hi>Blessing;</hi> it travels with it; it labours to raise it self into God, that by the
<hi>clearness</hi> of his Light, by the <hi>fulness</hi> of his Life, it may bring it forth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
A Spiritual man is like <hi>Abraham,</hi> who had in himself that <hi>Seed,</hi> in
which all the Nations of the Earth were to be blessed. He hath conceived with
a Seed of Blessedness to all Creatures. Therefore as <hi>Paul</hi> travelled in birth
with the <hi>Galatians,</hi> till <hi>Christ was formed in them:</hi> so doth a good man travel
in birth by <hi>Prayer,</hi> having many <hi>Pangs,</hi> and <hi>Throws</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> till this
Blessedness be formed in each Soul.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 22. <hi>All things are yours,</hi> &amp;c. A
Heavenly Spirit is an <hi>Universal Father;</hi> it look<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon all Creatures, as its own
<hi>Off-spring,</hi> or <hi>Bowels.</hi> As <hi>Job sacrificed</hi> constantly for his Children, while they
were <hi>feasting</hi> in their course: So is this Spirit <hi>praying</hi> for the Souls of men,
while they are <hi>playing</hi> away themselves in Vanity. This is the <hi>First Ministry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Exhortation by words to men. David <hi>promiseth, and prophesieth,</hi> Psal.
51. 13. I will teach transgress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urs thy ways, and Sinners shall be converted unto
thee. <hi>Before in the former verse he had prayed;</hi> Restore thy Ioy, and establish
thy free Spirit in me. <hi>Then he adds;</hi> I will teach transgressours thy ways, (<hi>the
ways of thy Love and Wisdom with man</hi>) Sinners shall be converted unto
thee, <hi>that is, by the report of thy sweet</hi> Contrivances <hi>upon me, and</hi> Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
<hi>towards me. When the</hi> Heart <hi>feels the Waters of Divine Life and Joy
bubling up warm from the bosom of the Godhead, then the</hi> Tongue <hi>becomes
the Pen of a ready Writer, labouring to imprint the Form of the same Life
and Joys upon other hearts also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you will have me weep when you speak, weep your self, you that speak,
said a Wise man. When a man utters those heavenly Loves, Truths, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of Jesus Christ, in which his own Soul lies melting and bathing her self,
while he reports them: Then he often hath his <hi>Tongue</hi> made the <hi>Quill</hi> of the
Godhead, by which he toucheth other Souls, and makes the same <hi>Musick</hi> upon
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> call his <hi>Tongue,</hi> his <hi>Glory,</hi> because by it he displayed that Glory of
God, which was treasured up in <hi>his</hi> heart, to the view of <hi>many</hi> Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:49838:33"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that God hath chosen the <hi>Foolishness of Preaching</hi> to make
it <hi>His Power</hi> unto Salvation God sends down the highest Glory into inferiour
Forms, in which they descend by degrees; then in the lowest they become a
<hi>Seed,</hi> out of which they grow and rise again by degrees to their first Height.
So the <hi>Divinity</hi> puts its self into <hi>our Saviour,</hi> then into <hi>our Hearts,</hi> then into <hi>our
Tongues,</hi> so into <hi>Words</hi> hovering in the <hi>Air,</hi> thus <hi>low</hi> it is become. Now by
<hi>Words,</hi> as a <hi>Seed</hi> it is cast into the <hi>Ear</hi> of another, so it passeth into the <hi>Heart,</hi>
where it springeth up into the <hi>Fairness of Christ,</hi> and from that into the <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Example of Life before Men.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Saints! <hi>Philip. 2. 15.
They should be blameless, and harmless, in the midst of a crooked generation, in
which they shine, as Light.</hi> When one <hi>Candle</hi> is lighted, we light many by
that. When God hath kindled the Life of his Glory in one man's <hi>Heart,</hi> he
often enlightens many by the Flame of that spread thorow his Conversation.
Philosophers tell us; that, every thing hath <hi>Beams,</hi> by which it <hi>manifests,</hi> and
<hi>multiplies</hi> itself, Sure nothing hath so piercing, so plentiful <hi>Beams,</hi> as the <hi>Divine
Nature.</hi> When this is brought forth in any Spirit, it cannot but manifest itself
by beautiful <hi>Beams</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Holiness;</hi> as it <hi>manifests,</hi> so it often <hi>multiplies</hi>
itself upon other Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When thou art Converted,</hi> saith Christ to <hi>Peter strengthen thy Brethr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n.</hi> It is
the Perfection of <hi>Life</hi> to bring forth its <hi>Like.</hi> When a man is himself made
partaker of the life of God: The Perfection of this life displays itself with such
<hi>power,</hi> and <hi>luster</hi> thorow the whole man; that it many times draws strangers,
first into the <hi>Love,</hi> then into the <hi>Likeness</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Cause: Manages of Providence,</hi> These are often <hi>Moral Helps</hi> to Man,
<hi>Outward Hints,</hi> which God is pleased to make, and take for the Inward, and
Spiritual work of our Conversion. But as they say of <hi>Stars:</hi> they do not <hi>operate,</hi>
but <hi>indicate</hi> only; not <hi>produce,</hi> but <hi>point</hi> out effects, and events in Earthly things:
So outward Providences, when they are most, are <hi>Concurrencies</hi> only, not
<hi>Causes</hi> in a proper sense: not <hi>Living Hands</hi> to do any thing in the Truth of
this Change; but as <hi>Hands in a Margin,</hi> to <hi>declare</hi> sometimes, what <hi>God</hi> is doing.</p>
            <p>These Workings of <hi>Providence,</hi> by <hi>Natural effects</hi> in our Bodies; <hi>civil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents</hi>
in our Life; <hi>Moral Impressions</hi> on our Hearts are as the motion of the
Waters, when the Angel descended into the Pool, which motion <hi>accompanied,</hi>
but <hi>contributed</hi> nothing to the Healing Vertue, <hi>It is not of him, that wills, nor
of him, that runs; but of God, that hath mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes God brings forth this <hi>Change;</hi> when the Waters of outward
<hi>Providence</hi> are quite calm; as when the <hi>Apostles</hi> were called from their <hi>Nets;
Matthew</hi> from the <hi>Custom; Gideon</hi> from the <hi>Flail; Elisha</hi> from the <hi>Plow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes God spreadeth this healing, and enlivening vertue thorow the
Soul, when the Waters of the Natural man work high a contrary way; as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49838:34"/>
when <hi>Saul</hi> was chang'd into <hi>Paul,</hi> he was <hi>then surprized</hi> with the Love, and
appearance of Jesus Christ, <hi>when</hi> he was <hi>persecuting</hi> him.</p>
            <p>Yet it pleaseth our Father very often to manage, and <hi>forelay</hi> outward things
so; that he takes hold of them, as <hi>occasions,</hi> or <hi>opportunities</hi> to make his way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Souls.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Two things</hi> in <hi>outward Providence,</hi> which God especially makes
use of to this purpose:
<list>
                  <item>1. Natural Affections.</item>
                  <item>2. Temporal Afflictions.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Natural Affections.</hi> As we season Vessels for the Liquor, with which
we mean to fill them; and as the Threshers of old had the <hi>Staff</hi> for the more tender
Corn, and the <hi>Wheel</hi> for the Harder: So God made <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist of a
gentle Heart, seasoned with <hi>Still,</hi> but <hi>Strong</hi> affections; like a River, that runs
quiet, but swift and deep. This <hi>John</hi> Jesus Christ takes into his bosom, makes him
his <hi>Lute,</hi> on which he sounds forth his softest, sweetest Loves, Beauty, Delights:
So he lives, so he dies.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> was naturally more of the <hi>Rock,</hi> and <hi>Flint;</hi> sharp, hard, and fiery, Jesus
Christ brings the <hi>Wheel</hi> over him, and breaks him forely, while he first forswears
his Saviour near his Cross; then afterwards is forc'd to follow his Saviour to
the Cross.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a vigorous, profound Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rit by Nature, and Education; Jesus
Christ flashes upon him a with Glory from Heaven; fills him with the deep, and
high Discoveries of Divine Glory; makes him to fill the world with the loud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of them; as the <hi>Trumpet</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p>Our Lord found some of his Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es <hi>Fishing.</hi> He takes hold of them by this,
which was their Employment, and Enjoyment; their Inclination, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Education:
<hi>Come,</hi> saith he, <hi>follow me, and I will make you Fishers of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>One Man is caught and carried by</hi> sensual <hi>Beauties, and Pleasures: Jesus
Christ covers the Golden Hook of His Love, and Spirit with a Bait of Beauty,
and Pleasure to take this Man:</hi> come, saith Christ, and follow me. I am fairer
than the Sons of men. I have a Beauty beyond that of any Creature. I am the
Brightness of the Eternal Glory; the Lively Image of the Invisible God. I am
the Light and Life of all Loveliness in all the Creatures, They, when they shine
sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>test, are but shadows to me, shadows of me. I am all Pleasant altogether; all
Pleasantnesses, and Delights together. <hi>As Jesus Christ whispers this to the So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l,
he lets fall upon it a Glimpse, a Touch, a Tast of Himself, which makes all
this Real. So he ravisheth the Soul of this Man from the midst of his Vanities,
Sensualities, Lusts, into his own Embraces, by the strength of a higher, though
purer Delight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another man is <hi>Rational,</hi> and Philosophical, led, by inclination, and study
to trace the hidden ways of Nature, to search the first Springs, and continued
course of Things. The Lord Jesus works Himself into the Reason, and specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49838:34"/>
of this Man: <hi>Come,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>and follow me. I am the Wisdom
of God, by which the whole Creation was contrived, came forth, and is carried on.
I am the beginning, the way, the end of all things. Time draws out its Line,
and runs its Race, in me, Eternity comprehends itself, in its Center, and Circle,
in me. All the Treasures of Knowledge are in my Love. You shall see all Mysteries,
all Forms, and Motions of God, and the Creature, bare and naked in my Light.</hi>
As He speaks this, He opens something of Himself upon the Soul, which gives
it a Glance of this Light, and Sight. Now He, that sat before at <hi>Gamaliels</hi>
feet, like <hi>Paul,</hi> sets his feet upon the head of all that learning, and sits with
<hi>Mary,</hi> at the feet of Christ. Now Jesus Christ is the <hi>Reason of</hi> his <hi>Reason,</hi> and
the only <hi>Reason to</hi> it. Now <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is all his <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and <hi>Study.</hi> Thus
God makes use of <hi>Natural Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Temporal Afflictions.</hi> You have a Platform of Gods working by these,
from the mouth of <hi>Elihu:</hi> Job. 33. 19. <hi>He is chastned with pain upon his bed,
the multitude of his bones with strong pain.</hi> The place of a mans Rest, and
Pleasure, is made the place of his Torment. All the several Principles, and
Strengths of Life are several Springs, Seats, and Strengths of Pain, and Misery,</p>
            <p>20. v. <hi>His Life abhorreth Bread, and his Soul dainty Meat.</hi> The Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life is tedious, and becomes a Burthen. The most pleasant Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments,
the sweetest delicacies of Nature, and the Creature are now loath'd.</p>
            <p>21. v. <hi>His Flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen, his bones that were
not seen, stick out.</hi> All the cloathings, all the Beauties of his Being wither, and
wear away. Those <hi>Forms</hi> in which he walked, disappear. The <hi>Foundations,</hi>
the lowest Principles of being in him, are discovered, and left naked; like the
<hi>Sea</hi> without waters, a <hi>Deep</hi> having no Face, but that of Darkness; an <hi>Earth,</hi>
void, and without Form.</p>
            <p>22. v. <hi>His Soul draweth near unto the Grave; and his Life to the Destroyers.</hi>
The Life of the Spirit in the Body is now sinking into a Silent Darkness.
The Life of the Spirit in itself is almost swallowed up into those Spirits, which
are the <hi>principles</hi> of a dark, a dying Life; or a living Darkness, and Death.</p>
            <p>23. <hi>v.</hi> If there be a Messenger with him, an Interpreter, one among a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
to shew to man his Uprightness. <hi>Now in this</hi> Evening-close <hi>of life, and joy;
in this</hi> rushing approach <hi>of a dreadful, eternal Night; Jesus Christ steps forth,
as a</hi> Messenger, an Interpreter <hi>between God, and Man. He opens upon him</hi> his
own <hi>Beauty, the</hi> mans own, <hi>proper, and true Beauty; which was</hi> his own,
<hi>in Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>24. v. <hi>Then he is gracious to him, and saith: Deliver him from going into the
Pit. I have found a Ransom.</hi> Then the Father smiles upon the Soul. Then He
gives a command in the Ears of the Soul to all the <hi>Invisible Ministers</hi> of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Death; to let him go: To all the Spirits of Life, and Light; to take
charge of him, to hold him in their Arms, that his Life come not into the
Prison of Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49838:35"/>
25. v. <hi>His Flesh shall be fresher than a Childs; he shall return to the days of

            <p>Jesus Christ is the <hi>Way</hi> of both these. A man can receive nothing from
God, can never come to God; but <hi>thorow</hi> Jesus Christ. Thus nothing comes
to us, or from us; nothing comes to pass round about us; which is not first

Dark Part of it? Yet he also shall go, as it is written of him, upon the Heart
of God, but in <hi>Fiery Letters. God hath made all things for Himself, even the
wicked for the Day of Wrath:</hi> Prov. 16. 4</p>
            <p>But how can we abide in the Dark, or bitter Part of things; in Flesh, and
Sin: If we know, that the <hi>Will</hi> of God is the <hi>Rule</hi> of all things, and an <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi>

God, and walks in Darkness, lies, and the Truth is not in him:</hi> 1 John 1. 6. He
that saith, he sees the Will of God to act all things, and yet is himself acted
by a Contrary Will, checks and contradicts himself, while he speaks, and acts.</p>

            </p>
            <p>These are the <hi>Two states in Religion:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A Servile State.</item>
                  <item>2. A Son-like State.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As St.</hi> Paul <hi>saith in another case:</hi> First is that which is Natural, then that
which is Spiritual: <hi>so it is true in this:</hi> First <hi>is the</hi> Servile State <hi>in Religion,</hi> then <hi>the</hi> Son-like. <hi>So we read,</hi> Gal. 4. 7. Now are ye no more Servants, but
Sons.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Son-like State</hi> is the <hi>second step,</hi> or <hi>Remove</hi> in Religion.</p>
            <p>But it will be necessary for me to open the <hi>Servile</hi> State first, that the <hi>Son-like</hi>
may be the better understood.</p>
            <p>1. State, Servile. <hi>This</hi> State <hi>hath</hi> Four Signs.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Sign: Fear.</item>
               <item>2. Sign: Dependencies.</item>
               <item>3. Sign: Forms.</item>
               <item>4. Sign: Solicitude.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. Sign: Fear. A Saint in a Servile State serves God chiefly from a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Fear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. Ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to fear. <hi>St.</hi>
Paul <hi>doth not speak here of a</hi> Sinful State in Nature, <hi>but of a</hi> Servile State in
Grace. <hi>This will appear clearly, if you compare this place with the</hi>
fourth Chapter <hi>of the</hi> Epistle <hi>to the</hi> Galatians. <hi>You shall see in both Places,
the</hi> Twofold State <hi>of a</hi> Servant, <hi>and a</hi> Son <hi>in Religion described alike, almost
in the same terms.</hi> Rom. 8. 15. Ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage
again. Galat. 4. 1. The Heir, while a Child, differeth nothing from a Servant.
v. 3. Ye were in bondage to worldly Elements. <hi>V.</hi> 7. Now are ye no longer Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 17. But the Spirit of Adoption, whereby ye cry Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Now are ye Sons, if Sons, then Heirs. <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 6. He hath sent forth the
Spirit of his Son into our Hearts, whereby we cry, Abba Father. 7. Sons and
Heirs <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Spirit of Bondage is a Spirit sent forth from God in the ministry of
the Law. Therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith, <hi>Ye have not received the Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi>
This Spirit begets men to God, but it is in a <hi>Servile-State,</hi> by, and to
Fear. <hi>Fear</hi> is the <hi>Seed</hi> and <hi>Fruit</hi> of this Spirit; So a man by it becomes a
<hi>Son</hi> to God, but <hi>by</hi> the <hi>Bond-woman.</hi> So he is partly a <hi>Son,</hi> partly a <hi>Servant;</hi>
or rather a <hi>Son</hi> in the State of a <hi>Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I must further explain this <hi>Fear</hi> by,

                  <item>1. The Distinction of Fear.</item>
                  <item>2. The Object.</item>

            </p>
            <p>1. The Distinction of Fear. <hi>There is a</hi> Twofold Fear.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Fear, Slavish.</item>
               <item>2. Fear, Filial.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Fear, Slavish.</hi> This <hi>Fear</hi> comes before <hi>Love,</hi> and is cast out, when
<hi>Love</hi> comes: 1 <hi>John. 4. 18. Perfect Love casteth out Fear.</hi> But what <hi>Fear</hi>
is this? That, which is <hi>Slavish.</hi> So it is added: <hi>Fear hath Torment.</hi> A <hi>Slav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Fear</hi> is to the Heart, as <hi>Fire</hi> is to Gold, Gold is wrought by the Fire to a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49838:36"/>
softness, and fitness, to receive the King's Image: then it is taken out of the
Fire. So this Fear subdues the Heart to a yielding temper, to receive the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
and Image of God in Love. Then it is cast ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Fear, Filial.</hi> This follows after <hi>Love,</hi> flows from it, is as sweet, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
as <hi>Love</hi> itself. The <hi>Scripture</hi> saith in one Place: <hi>Who would not fear thee?</hi>
This <hi>Fear</hi> is a <hi>Plyantness</hi> of the Soul to God, yielding to him, form a near
sense of his <hi>Greatness,</hi> and <hi>Goodness, both in one.</hi> It is like the <hi>Bowing</hi> of some
Flowers towards the Sun, being toucht with his Influences, and Beams.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 6. An Angel in the midst of Heaven preacheth the Everlasting
Gospel. <hi>What is the</hi> Everlasting Gospel? <hi>The glad Tidings of Eternal Love
in God to the Creature. This Angel at the seventh v. cries aloud:</hi> Fear <hi>God.
This</hi> Fear <hi>answers</hi> Love, <hi>and</hi> Ecchos <hi>to it in the Heart:</hi> Love <hi>saith:</hi> God is thine.
Fear <hi>saith:</hi> I will no more be mine own. Love <hi>saith: God</hi> will come down into
thee, and fill thee, <hi>Fear saith:</hi> I will sink down out of my self, and give way to God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Filial Fear</hi> is proper to the <hi>Son-like</hi> State. It is the <hi>Slavish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fear,</hi> which
is the <hi>Sign</hi> of that <hi>Servile State</hi> of which we now speak.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Son-like State</hi> hath <hi>Love</hi> for its <hi>Eldest</hi> Child; <hi>Fear</hi> for its <hi>Youngest.</hi> A <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
State</hi> hath <hi>Fear</hi> for its <hi>First-born: Love</hi> here is a <hi>Younger Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Son Fear</hi> is the <hi>Motion of</hi> Love. In the <hi>Servant</hi> it is the <hi>Motive to</hi>
Love.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Servant</hi> is the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Bond-woman.</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> is born of the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman.</hi>
The Soul in a <hi>Servile</hi> State of Religion <hi>ascends</hi> out of <hi>Flesh</hi> towards
God. So <hi>Fear</hi> is First, and <hi>Love</hi> riseth out of Fear, as <hi>Fire</hi> out of <hi>Smoak.</hi> The
Soul in a <hi>Son-like state descends,</hi> comes down from God, as a <hi>Bride</hi> ready trim'd.
So <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ve</hi> is First, and brings forth <hi>Fear,</hi> as a pure <hi>Flame</hi> breaths from it a fine
<hi>Air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Distinction</hi> of <hi>Fear.</hi> This the <hi>Sign</hi> of a <hi>Servile</hi> State, a <hi>Slavish</hi> Fear.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Object of Fear.</hi> This is exprest <hi>by</hi> the Holy Ghost: <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Those,
that were held in bondage, by the Fear of Death.</hi> The Jews were under the
Law, in a <hi>Servile State,</hi> under a <hi>Slavish Fear.</hi> This <hi>Fear</hi> had <hi>Death</hi> in its Eye,
for its <hi>Object. Death</hi> hath two things in it, <hi>Loss,</hi> and <hi>Pain; Loss</hi> of Life, with
all the Sweets, and Comforts of Life: <hi>Pain</hi> in the Labours, and Pangs at the
parting of Soul, and Body,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus a</hi> Slavish Fear <hi>hath a</hi> Twofold Object:
<list>
                  <item>1: Object, Loss.</item>
                  <item>2. Object, Pain.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Object, Loss.</hi> A Christian in a <hi>Servile State</hi> fears the <hi>Loss</hi> of God, more
than <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Fear of God</hi> makes a man sink out of himself into God. <hi>Fear
of Loss</hi> of him makes a man apt to sink into himself in Despair. A Servile
Christian fears the loss of <hi>Gods Favour,</hi> more than the loss of <hi>God:</hi> the loss
of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of his Favour, which are Peace within, Prosperity without;
more than the loss of his <hi>Favour.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49838:37"/>
2. <hi>Object: Pain.</hi> A Spiritual, <hi>Son-like</hi> Saint fears the Departures of God,
the loss of Divine Enjoyments, more then all Pains or Tortures. But the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
in Religion is not any thing so much sensible of the loss of all the joys
in Heaven; as he is struck with, trembles at the pains of Hell.</p>
            <p>Iohn the Baptist <hi>was a Figure of the</hi> Servile State. <hi>He presseth his</hi> Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>with such</hi> Reasons, as these: The Axe is laid to the Root of the Tree. Save
your selves from that wrath, which is to come.</p>
            <p>Iesus Christ <hi>was the</hi> Head, <hi>and</hi> Figure <hi>of the</hi> Son-like State. <hi>He moveth by
other</hi> Arguments: The Kingdom of God is at hand. Light is come into the World.
Come to me, and have life in abundance.</p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>First,</hi> and most apparent <hi>Sign</hi> of a <hi>Servile State: Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Sign: Dependencies. A Servile Christian seeks God chiefly by outward As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistances.</hi> Gal. 3. 24. <hi>The Law was a School-master to bring us to Christ.</hi> A
School-master ties Children to their set Times, Rules, Exercises; till they can
speak a Language, judge of Truth, converse with wisdom naturally, from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and free Principles. So the Law, which is the Mistris, under whom we
are in bondage, teacheth us, to seek Communion with God at peculiar Times:
The Forming of our Spirits according to God, by particular Rules: The
Deriving of Truths, Strengths Comforts from God, by several Performances.
This is our way of Life, till the Seed of Life be come up in us, which makes
Divine Love, as our Pulse: Faith, our Breath: Holiness, our Constitution.</p>
            <p>Galat. 3. 23. <hi>We were kept under the Law, shut up unto the Faith, that should
be revealed.</hi> A Legal Christian having a perpetual Alarm of Fears within him,
entrencheth himself strongly in Promises and Threatnings, Ordinances and
Duties in the outward Letter, as a Wall, or Mount of Earth. He plants a
Guard about his Spirit, of Resolutions, Vows, and such like Fleshly obligations.
He takes care for a constant supply of Provision from without, from the Gifts,
and Parts of men, for a maintenance of these Forces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Angels,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Marry not, nor are given in Marriage.</hi> Angels are ever
strong, ever feasted, yet have no Meals: They are always refresh't, and at rest,
yet have no season for Sleep: They marry not to any thing without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
yet they multiply themselves, their Images, and Fruits to Eternity. Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man must have his Meal; and Sleeps in their appointed time, or else he dies. He
must joyn himself in marriage to another without himself, or else he remains
barren. Such is a Christian under the Law, if he have not his Duties, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,

as the Sun shines, God is kind, a man truly Spiritual is holy, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.
But where is that man among the whole race of men, who loves God,
lives in God, as his <hi>Element,</hi> lives to God, as his Joy, and Glory; and all this,
because it is <hi>his Nature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot these the times of which our <hi>Saviour</hi> spake, when he said: <hi>Shall
the Son of Man find Faith upon the Earth?</hi> In what heart can we find such a
<hi>Faith,</hi> such a <hi>Union</hi> between God, and Man, as that these Two shall have but
<hi>one Life;</hi> that the Man may say, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did: <hi>Now Christ liveth in me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this universal Dis-appearance of the Divine Nature, it were happy, if
men would serve God from the Force of <hi>Fear,</hi> when they cannot do it from
a natural <hi>Freedom:</hi> If men would be wrought by an awe to a <hi>Compliance</hi>
with God, while yet they have no <hi>Complacency</hi> in him.</p>
            <p>O that men would <hi>fear,</hi> if they cannot <hi>love</hi> that Omni-present, Omni-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
God, in whom we all live, by whom we breath!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall urge this</hi> Exhortation by Four Persuasives.</p>
            <p>1: <hi>Persuasive. Fear the Loss of the Divine Presence here on Earth. Job</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
a great sense of this, <hi>Job.</hi> 29, He sighs out his complaints: v. 2. O
<hi>that it were with me, as in the days of old, when God preserved me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> v. 3. <hi>When
his Candle shined upon my Head, when by his Light I walked thorow Darkness.</hi>
The <hi>Candle</hi> is the Image of God in Nature, which burns in the Seven-fold
Candlestick of the Angelical Nature. This Glory rested upon the Spirit of
<hi>Job's</hi> Natural Man, as a Light upon his Head, leading him thorow the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Fleshly Being. <hi>v. 4. As I was in the days of my Youth, when the
Secret of God was upon my Tabernacle.</hi> The <hi>Secret</hi> of God is the Invisible
Glory of the Divine Image among the Angels, which before he express'd by
the Candle. The <hi>Angels</hi> seem to be the <hi>Secret.</hi> For they are the Chambers, the
Pavili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns of God. God was in the midst of them in the Dark at <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi>
The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> is the Body, or outward Man.</p>
            <p>To this place agrees that in the <hi>Psalm.</hi> Psal. 34. 7. <hi>The Angel of the Lord
pitcheth his Camp round about them, that fear him. The Angel of the Lord, or
the Angel the Lord,</hi> is the Divine Image in Nature, and the Law. The <hi>Camp,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49838:38"/>
the Host, or Armies of Angels. In the Gospel, instead of this <hi>Image</hi> is Jesus
Christ; instead of <hi>Angels</hi> in their <hi>Natural Glory,</hi> are Angels in a <hi>Spiritual State,</hi>
residing upon the <hi>Head,</hi> the Spirit; the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> the visible Frame, the
Bodily Being of a Saint.</p>
            <p>V. 5. <hi>When the Almighty was yet with me: When my Children were yet about
me. Job</hi> in his first days was a <hi>Type</hi> of man in Innocency. The Presence of
the Almighty in the Angelical Nature on the <hi>top</hi> of his Spirit was, as the <hi>Head</hi>
of his Being. The <hi>Angelical Lives</hi> putting themselves forth in the rest of
bodily things, as <hi>Souls</hi> to them, were as the <hi>Children,</hi> Images, and Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Soul of Man. But at the Fall, the Almighty withdrew from man:
These <hi>Lives</hi> were drawn in from the rest of the Creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>V. 6. When I washt my steps in Butter; When the Rock poured me out Rivers
of Oil.</hi> The <hi>steps</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> were his wayes below in the visible part of things;
which were wash'd with the Peace and Plenty of Inferiour Contents, raised from
these Inferiour Creatures, as <hi>Butter, Rivers of Oyl.</hi> The Spirit of Angelical,
Divine Life, among invisible, Superiour Glories did flow forth abundantly
upon him, from that <hi>Rock,</hi> which was the Almighty.</p>
            <p>These Words of <hi>Job</hi> afford us a <hi>Twofold Principle of Policy</hi> for Natural
things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Principle.</hi> The Divine Presence is the spring of all Earthly Comforts.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Principle.</hi> The Removal of this Presence is the Root of all Bitterness in this
Life.</p>
            <p>1. Principle. <hi>The Divine Presence is the spring of all earthly Comforts.</hi> Tell
me, O Man! what hath kept thee thy Peace, and Plenty, all thy Dayes,
Months, and Years? <hi>Thy God hath preserved thee.</hi> When thou hast been in
a doubtful, difficult, dangerous State of things; what then hath pointed out a
clear and shining path to thee in that darkness? When thou hast had trouble
in thine Affairs, calamities in thy Person, confusion in thy Soul; what then
hath sent forth a Beam of Comfort, and Council through thy Spirit, to light
thee out of all these; <hi>The Candle of God hath been upon thy head:</hi> God hath
look'd sweetly forth from the top of thy Spirit, through the Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and this hath been thy Light. When thou hast wash'd thy Feet as
thou hast walk'd, in smooth, soft, flowing streams of Peace, and Plenty: when
thou hast seen thy Children playing about thee, like lively Lambs in pleasant
Pastures; while thou hast been as their Sheepherd, feeding thy Spirit from
invisible Spirits, and then feeding their Spirit from thine; who gave thee all
these? <hi>The secret of the Almighty was with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Principle. <hi>The Removal of the Divine Presence is the Root of all Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in this Life.</hi> When God <hi>withdraws,</hi> he <hi>draws</hi> in all his Blessings, as the
Sun often goes in, and gives up the Sky, and Day to dark Clouds. What
wilt thou do, when like wretched <hi>Saul, The Philistines are upon thee, and God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49838:38"/>
hath forsaken thee?</hi> When Perplexity shall take hold of thy Spirit, when
there shall be no Counsel or Comfort left, because God hath forsaken thee?
What then can all thy Pleasures or Honours do? Will they not be as mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Comforters, as the <hi>Witch</hi> of <hi>Endor</hi> to <hi>Saul;</hi> presenting thee with Devils
under God-like forms; ill-boding, foretelling thy death and Ruine?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When our dear Saviour was on the Cross, he did not cry out,</hi> O my Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples!
why do ye fly from me, or deny me? O ye Iews, my Brethren! why do ye
wound so bloodily my Feet, Hands, and Head? <hi>No, but he cries out;</hi> My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me; <hi>This broke his heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> complains in <hi>Psal. 30. 7. Thou hast made my Mountain strong; but
thou didst turn away thy face, and I was troubled.</hi> Place a man in a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Horrours, in a Sea of Flames, let the <hi>Secret</hi> of God be with him, and
he will fear, he will feel no Evil. Plant a man on a Mountain, where he
may not only with Christ see, but possess all the Delights and Glories of this
World; let God be gone, and you may call them all <hi>Ichabod; where's the
Glory? Where's the Delight?</hi> The whole Mountain will moulder into Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
and crumble away into Griefs.</p>
            <p>O! Fear to estrange this God from you by a neglect of him, on whose
Presence all your present Joyes depend. Fear to put out his Light in your
Souls, by your Lusts: fear to chase away by your hardnesses and Rebellions,
that God; who, when he removes his Glory from off any Person, or Place;
gives up all to ruine, and leaves a Hell behind him.</p>
            <p>This is the first <hi>Persuasive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Persuasive. <hi>Fear the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ss of Divine Enjoyments after Death.</hi> Is there
any thing, any where, more moving, more full of sweetness, than the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Apostle: 1 <hi>Thes. 4. 18. Then we shall be for ever with the Lord.
Comfort ye one another with these words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will present your Spirits with the force of this place, in <hi>three</hi> short <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Proposition. <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re is a Lord over all;</hi> a supream <hi>Principle,</hi> or Power,
which makes, maintains, manages all the Creatures; a <hi>Spirit</hi> of Strength and
Wisdom, which governs the affairs of the whole World. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks, 1. <hi>Cor. 8. 6. To us there is one God, the Father, of whom are All; one
Lord Jesus, by whom are All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Proposition. <hi>This Lord is the best of all things.</hi> As he is <hi>over,</hi> so he is
<hi>above</hi> all. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him, <hi>the Lord of Glory.</hi> The <hi>Heathens</hi>
teach us, that the God of the Sun, is the God of Musick; because he <hi>tempers</hi>
with his Beams, and tunes all the visible world. This Lord, our Lord is the
God of Light, Beauty, Musick, the God of all Sweetnesses, Glories, Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.
For he <hi>tunes</hi> both the visible, and invisible World, to a happy
<hi>Harmouy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:49838:39"/>
3. Proposition. <hi>All good Spirits are the Friends; all evil Spirits the Enemies
of this Lord.</hi> Each pure, lightsome, peaceful Spirit comes from this Jesus,
and goes to him again, when it goes off the Stage of this Earth; as a Beam
darted from his Glory, and drawn up to him again. Each dark, unclean,
disorderly Spirit is cut off, and cast out from him. One is every where in
Scripture stiled, <hi>His Child, His Brother.</hi> The other is thus spoken to by him;
<hi>Depart from me, ye cursed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what joy is it, when a man in all the troubles of Life, can comfort
himself with these words, and say: <hi>This Life will quickly end; then shall I be
ever with the Lord, my Lord, the Lord of Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssedness?</hi> Who can express the
Peace and Pleasure of that Soul within, which lies upon its Death-bed, and
in the last moment of its abode in the World, comforts itself with these words,
<hi>Now I must be uncloath'd of all Being, or Appearance among men on Earth for
ever: But it is, that I may be for ever in the naked Embraces of the Eternal Spirit
of Life, and Beauty. I go from hence for ever, but I go to be for ever with the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I had faint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d</hi> saith David, <hi>if I had not hoped to see the Goodness of the Lord in
the land of the Living.</hi> Who can tell those fainting fits in the midst of highest
Pleasures, those bitter, Soul-turning Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aulmes in fullest Glories; which those
men have, that have no hope to see the Goodness of the Lord after this Life?
Many pangs, many pangs of remorse, and anguish, pangs far beyond the
pangs of a natural Death, hath that dying Soul, which hath no hope to live
with God after Death.</p>
            <p>Fear then this <hi>Loss</hi> so great, so irreparable. Fear to be prophane, like <hi>Esau;</hi>
to sell your <hi>Birth-right</hi> for a Mess of <hi>Pottage,</hi> to fell your hopes of Heaven for
a short Satisfaction to your sensual Appetite.</p>
            <p>3. Persuasive. <hi>Fear, what God can do.</hi> What cannot he do to make you
miserable, who is the <hi>God of the Spirits of all Flesh?</hi> He can let forth <hi>Five
Spirits</hi> upon you:
<list>
                  <item>1. Spirit of Diseases.</item>
                  <item>2. Spirit of Folly, and Falshood.</item>
                  <item>3. Spirit of Melancholy.</item>
                  <item>4. Spirit of Ruine.</item>
                  <item>5. His own Spirit.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Spirit of Diseases.</hi> God can send a <hi>Spirit of Diseases</hi> into thy Body, to
strike thee with <hi>Worms,</hi> with some foul and sharp sickness, till thou dye a
loath'd, and horrid Death. Thus he did to King <hi>Herod</hi> in the <hi>Acts.</hi> Can all
thy Physicians then cure thee?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Spirit of Folly and Falshood.</hi> God can send into thy Breast a Lying
<hi>Spirit,</hi> that shall carry the on to foolish Counsels, that thou mayst perish.
Thus he did with King <hi>Ahab.</hi> Can thy Wisdom foresee, or prevent this?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Spirit of Melancholy.</hi> God can let forth upon thee a <hi>Spirit,</hi> that shall sit
upon thy Brain and Heart like a black Cloud, distilling poyson upon both.
This shall be thy inseparable Companion at Table, and Bed; in society, in soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
to vex thee perpetually. This shall make thy sweetest Delights, thy dearest
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49838:39"/>
Relations a Burthen and a disease to thee. This shall make thy surest Strengths,
and firmest aids a matter of continual Suspicion, and mortal Jealousy to thee,
Thus he did with King <hi>Saul.</hi> What delights or businesses can now divert thee?</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Spirit, of Ruine.</hi> God can let upon thee, as upon <hi>Job,</hi> a <hi>Spirit,</hi> like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
Sea, or Storm. This shall take away from thee, thy whole Estate;
from thy Children, their Life; from thy Wife, and wisest Friends, their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Tenderness. This will fill thy Skin with Noysomness; thy veins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with
Fire; thy Bones with Pains; thy Head with black vapours. This shall take away
all rest from thy Sleeps, filling them with affrighting Dreams; all peace from
thy waking hours, filling them w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

more hateful to thee, than the most hateful Death <hi>I chose Strangling, rather
than Life;</hi> saith <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 7. 15. What can help, or comfort thee, at such
a time as this? When an evil <hi>Spirit</hi> over-whelms all the Creatures to a man;
what can the Creatures do?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> I cannot express, I tremble to think this; God can make
his <hi>own Spirit a stream of Fire and Brimstone</hi> in thy Spirit, <hi>If. 30. 33. The
breath</hi> (the Spirit) <hi>of the Lord, a stream of Brimstone.</hi> God can himself be an
<hi>everlasting Burning</hi> upon thy Immortal part. <hi>Who can lie down with everlasting
Burnings?</hi> Can all thy Tears, or Pleasures quench these Burnings?</p>
            <p>Well might <hi>Moses</hi> cry out: <hi>Psal. 90. 11. Who knows the Power of his
Wrath. According to thy Fear, so is thy Wrath.</hi> You may read the latter Clause
thus: <hi>As is thy Wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so should the Fear of thee be.</hi> There is an unsearchableness,
an Incomprehensibleness in the Wrath of God. No Creature can take it in,
but is swallowed up by it.</p>
            <p>Let men <hi>fear</hi> God, according to his <hi>Wrath.</hi> Let men fear to make him their
Enemy, or if they do, let them meet so potent an Enemy betimes, while he is yet
on the way, that they may cast themselves at his Feet, with Submission, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
Fears, and Tears.</p>
            <p>If you harden your Heart by Insensibleness, or sensuality, he can multiply
the Stroak of Sorrow upon thy Heart seven times, seven times more, still seven
times, nay seventy times seven, endlesly, till thy Heart be ground to the smallest
Dust, and so lie under his Feet.</p>
            <p>If thy Soul be as high, rough, untractable, as a <hi>Whale,</hi> or <hi>Sea;</hi> He can
tame, and calm thee by Griefs.</p>
            <p>If thy Soul were a <hi>Leviathan,</hi> arm'd with impenetrable Scales over-looking
every lofty thing: God can make his <hi>Sword,</hi> which is his <hi>Spirit,</hi> to approach
thee: he can put h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Seas of Lust, and Pride, lay thee Panting, and Languishing upon the dry
Shore before him.</p>
            <p>Thus ends the <hi>Third Persuasive.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>saith:</hi> Galat. 4. <hi>v.</hi> 3. When we were Children, we were in Bendage

            <p>Mark, what <hi>Oppositions</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> maketh.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Opposition:</hi> Between the <hi>Elements of the World:</hi> and the <hi>Son sent forth.</hi>
When Jesus Christ the <hi>Heavenly Image</hi> of God is revealed in our Spirits, then
we are free from that Slavery of <hi>Spelling</hi> the Name of God out of the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
of <hi>this Creation.</hi> We no more go to the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> for their Learning;
that is, to the <hi>Principles of Nature</hi> for the knowledge of God.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Opposition:</hi> Between the <hi>Knowing of God,</hi> so as <hi>being known,</hi> or <hi>made
to know by God,</hi> and the <hi>Elements of the World.</hi> We know God by <hi>Divine
Principles,</hi> when we know him by an <hi>Immediate Union</hi> with Him, which gives
us the Naked Appearance of God in our Spirits, by the Mutual Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our Spirits in that Appearance, and Spirit.</p>
            <p>Till we thus know God, we know Him not. We have no <hi>Image,</hi> but <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows</hi>
only of Him. We know Him by Worldly Principles, which are Dark,
and Beggerly.</p>
            <p>

Time, <hi>and</hi> Eternity; <hi>the</hi> First, <hi>and the</hi> Second Creation. <hi>All the Empty, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
Things of this World are</hi> Flesh. Ioh. 6. 63. 1 Pet. 1. 24. Ioh. 17. 2.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Flesh <hi>is taken for the</hi> Corrupt State <hi>of Things: as</hi> Iude 23. The
Garment spotted with the Flesh.</p>
            <p>Sometimes <hi>it is taken for the</hi> Visible Part <hi>of</hi> Natural <hi>Things: as</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1.
All Filthiness of Flesh and Spirit. <hi>In the Former place</hi> Flesh <hi>was the Filth, that
defiled the Garment of Nature. Here it is</hi> Natures upper, <hi>and</hi> Outward Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>which is in danger of being defiled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Flesh <hi>is taken for the</hi> whole Frame <hi>of</hi> Nature <hi>in the</hi> Visible, <hi>and</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
<hi>Part of it. So</hi> Mat. 26. 41. The Spirit is willing, but the Flesh is weak.
<hi>The</hi> Spirit <hi>there is the</hi> Spiritual; <hi>the</hi> Flesh <hi>the</hi> Natural Man. <hi>So</hi> Luke 3. 6.
All Flesh shall see the Salvation of the Lord. <hi>This place is cited from</hi> Es. 40. 5.
The Glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all Flesh shall see it together. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
this with</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16. God manifest in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit,
seen of Angels Angels <hi>are Part of that</hi> Flesh, <hi>which sees the Glory of God, and
hath it revealed in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, Flesh <hi>is taken for</hi> Created Nature, <hi>both Body, and Spirit; as it is</hi> spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualized.
<hi>Jesus Christ spake in this sense:</hi> Iohn 6. 55. My flesh is meat indeed.
<hi>He expounds himself afterwards:</hi> v. 63. It is the Spirit, that quickeneth; the
Flesh profiteth nothing. <hi>Our Saviour means thus much:</hi> The Creature in me, as
it is a meer Creature, is uncapable of so near an Union with you, or so great a
vertue in itself, as to be the food, or Conveyance of Eternal Life to you. But as it
is become a New Creature, and is made One in Person, and Spirit with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature: So you may feed upon it after a Spiritual manner, and be nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up by it to Eternal Life. <hi>For so the Lord adds;</hi> The Words that I speak, are
Spirit and Life. <hi>So we read of the</hi> Fleshly Tables of the Heart.</p>
            <p>But the Common Acceptation of <hi>Flesh,</hi> when it is opposed to Spiritual
Things, and joyned with the <hi>Law,</hi> is the <hi>Third:</hi> that is, the <hi>first Creation,</hi> or
<hi>this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is manifest from the seventh of the</hi> Epistle <hi>to the</hi> Romans. <hi>v.</hi> 2. The
Woman is bound by the Law to her Husband, while he liveth; <hi>saith St.</hi> Paul
<hi>v.</hi> 4. Ye are dead to the Law by the Body of Christ, that ye may be married to
another, even to him who is raised from the Dead. <hi>He goes on, v.</hi> 5. When we
were in the Flesh, the Motions of Sin, which were by the Law. <hi>Then, v.</hi> 6.
But now we are delivered from the Law, that being dead, wherein we were
held.</p>
            <p>The Principles and Frame of Nature in the Invisible Powers, and visible
Parts of it are our <hi>Husband</hi> by the first Creation. For we were made subject
to Angels in that State, as in the New Creation we are to Jesus Christ. And
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49838:42"/>
we were made by Nature a little Lower than Angels, in the next degree of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriority
to them: as the <hi>Woman</hi> to the <hi>Man.</hi> This is plain by comparing
those Two Places: <hi>Psal. 8. 5. Thou hast made him</hi> (that is, man) <hi>a little low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the Angels:</hi> Heb. 2. 5. <hi>Unto Angels he hath not put in subjection the
World, which is to come:</hi> But unto Jesus Christ, That is implyed in the
Place.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Law</hi> is the Law of the Husband. Now the <hi>Law</hi> was administred by
<hi>Angels,</hi> the Ministring Spirits, which are Principalities, and Powers of this
Creation, as the Vice-Gerents of God.</p>
            <p>Now St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith; that by the Body of Christ that Husband died, which
held us in Subjection to the Law. The whole Frame of Nature was shaken
by the Death of Christ, and must fall by the Power of it.</p>
            <p>Then St. <hi>Paul</hi> adds, that we were subject to the <hi>Law</hi> while we were in the
<hi>Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these things make it plain, that by the Flesh he understands the <hi>State
of Nature</hi> in its highest <hi>Principles,</hi> and utmost <hi>Extent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for the First <hi>Term, Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Letter.</hi> This is the <hi>Image of God in Flesh. Letter</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are opposed
by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as <hi>Old,</hi> and <hi>New: Rom.</hi> 7. 4. And he teacheth us, that by the
Death of the <hi>Flesh</hi> in the Body of Christ, we are freed from our Service to
God in the <hi>Oldness of the Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> opposeth <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Letter,</hi> as <hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Outward.</hi> He calleth
that the <hi>Letter,</hi> which is <hi>Outward</hi> in the <hi>Flesh: Rom.</hi> 2. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spirit</hi> is Jesus Christ, as He is the Heavenly Image of God within in
the Heart of God; 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 15. This is that which is <hi>Inward,</hi> under the

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Letter</hi> is the Image of God in the outward <hi>Man,</hi> as it is drawn forth

            </p>
            <p>While we are under the <hi>Law,</hi> we are <hi>Infants,</hi> we have neither the <hi>Ear,</hi> nor
the <hi>Heart,</hi> nor the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the Spiritual man, in our Souls.
We are Uncapable of Taking in, or making out God in his own Divine
Image, according to Spiritual Principles, or the Elements of the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore we are in <hi>Bondage</hi> to Natural Principles, and Reasonings.</p>
            <p>We are bound up within the Compass of this Creation, as in a Prison. We
are unskill'd in, unacquainted with any Principles, or Appearances of things;
besides those of this Creation. We compare Spiritual Things by these Things
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49838:42"/>
of Nature. We hear God with the Ear, we speak of him with the Tongue, of
this Creation, We receive, and cherish such Notions of God, as are agreeable
with this Frame.</p>
            <p>The Manifestations of God, which spring from Spiritual Principles, from
the Face of God himself, are <hi>Barbarians</hi> to us, while we are under the Law.</p>
            <p>To the Law of Nature, to the Testimony of Reason, to the Elements of
this World; whatsoever speaketh not according to these, whatsoever casteth
off, or doth not cloth its Speakings with these Forms, though it be the Spirit
Himself; hath no Light in it to our Understandings, while we are under the
Law.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Elements,</hi> or <hi>Forms</hi> in which we are tied up, while we are under
the Law, are,
<list>
                  <item>1. Weak.</item>
                  <item>2. Dark.</item>
                  <item>3. Beggarly.</item>
                  <item>4. Old.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Forms are weak Things.</hi> They have only the <hi>Shadows</hi> of Good Things
to come. They have not the <hi>Substance.</hi> They cannot give us the Good
Things <hi>Themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Forms</hi> set the <hi>Picture</hi> of our Beloved before our Eyes; but they cannot lay
the <hi>Person</hi> Himself in our Arms. They are but a <hi>Letter</hi> from our Husband.
They have not the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Husband in them.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Forms</hi> in the knowledge of God are <hi>Dark</hi> Things. They can give us
no clear, or certain Discoveries.</p>
            <p>The greatest Light of Communion or Comfort, that can come, while we
are shut up in <hi>Forms,</hi> is but like a Spark from a Flint at Midnight. It hath
much Doubt, Diffidence, and Fear mingled with it.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Forms</hi> are <hi>Beggerly</hi> Things. They cannot lay open before us the Unsear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable
Riches of Christ.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ is Rich in Glory. He can fill all Appearances. He can bring
forth Innumerable Appearances. He hath Glory above all appearances, which
the Creature is capable of. He can bring forth more Glory into thy Heart,
than can be made out in thy Heart itself by any Appearance, The <hi>Power</hi> of
Glory which thy Spirit feels, shall be above the <hi>Appearance,</hi> which it sees,
1 <hi>Corin. 14. 14. Ephes.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
            <p>How poor then, and Beggarly must that Spirit be in the knowledge of the
Glory of God, which is shut up in any one Form, in any one Sort, or Degree
of Manifestations?</p>
            <p>While thou canst not part with any Particular Form of Appearance while
thy Spirit is not indifferent, and universal, extending itself to all Forms in the
Manifestation of God: while thou art not above the Forms of this World:
Thou wilt be but a <hi>Beggar</hi> in thy Divine Discoveries or Enjoyments.</p>
            <p>He must be above, the <hi>Letter,</hi> in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> above and out of all Created
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49838:43"/>
Images in the Light of Life itself, that will attain to those <hi>Riches of assurance
of a full understanding in the Mystery of God, and Christ,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks
of: <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Forms</hi> are <hi>Old.</hi> God hath blasted all Forms and Ways of his Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the Principles, and Elements of the Creature. If they have had any
Beauty, yet now they are <hi>Blear-eyed.</hi> If they have been Fruitful, yet now they
are become a Barren Womb, which is as the Grave.</p>
            <p>The Cross of Christ, and the Glory of his Appearance in the Spirit have
taken away the Life, and Glory of all Manifestations, or Administrations in
the Flesh.</p>
            <p>They are Old, Withered, Decayed, and Dying. The more our Saviour
shines out in the Glory of his Father, the more will they Droop till they drop
quite into the Dust,</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Sign: Solicitude. Rest,</hi> and <hi>want of Rest</hi> are the distinguishing Notes of
a <hi>Legal,</hi> or <hi>Evangelical</hi> State. <hi>His Rest shall be Glorious;</hi> saith the Prophet of
the Lord Jesus in the Times of the Gospel, <hi>Esa. 11. 10. Come to me,</hi> saith our
Saviour to those under the Law, <hi>You that labour, and are heavy laden, and I
will give you Rest,</hi> Mat. 11. 28.</p>
            <p>A Legal Spirit hath a <hi>Four-fold Solicitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Solicitude, for Acceptance of the Person.</item>
               <item>2. Solicitude, for Assiance in Perplexities.</item>
               <item>3. Solicitude, for Light in the way.</item>
               <item>4. Solicitude, for Life in the work of Grace.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Solicitude, for Acceptance of the Person.</hi> While the Soul is under the <hi>Law,</hi>
the <hi>Seed</hi> of God, Jesus Christ is not yet come up, nor revealed within her. She
sits therefore trembling in the Dark, sometimes Confident, that it is a Seed of
<hi>Love;</hi> sometimes as Peremptory, that it is a Seed of <hi>Wrath,</hi> which lies hid in
her. So she is perplexed, and anxious in herself.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 2. that <hi>Assurance</hi> ariseth from the <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment</hi>
of God in the <hi>Mystery</hi> even of the Father, and of Christ.</p>
            <p>The Mystery of the Gospel lies hid under the Law, the <hi>Heavenly Image</hi> is
covered, and kept out of Sight by the <hi>Earthly.</hi> All this while a Saint is apt to
be looking down into himself, and to judge of <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>Hatred,</hi> by those Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,
which he finds of either in himself. But still he finds those Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
Mixt, Unconstant, Doubtful. So he is ever tost from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with much Unstableness, and Unquietness.</p>
            <p>If he look up to God, he sees Him in a Cloud, thorow the Principles of the
Creature, in which he judgeth of God after the manner of Man; and so one
while he believes him to be a Sweet Friend; another while, an Irreconcileable
Enemy.</p>
            <p>But he that is truly <hi>Evangelical,</hi> looks upward still, like <hi>Stephen.</hi> He sees with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49838:43"/>
the Eye of his Spirit <hi>Heaven,</hi> that Divine Image, and State of things, opened
to him. He seeth the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> standing at the Right Hand of
the Father, and <hi>himself</hi> in the Arms of Jesus Christ, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was seen lying
in <hi>Abraham's</hi> Bosom.</p>
            <p>This Discovery of the Mystery of God above, gives him a full Assurance
concerning the Acceptance of his Person in the Beloved One.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Solicitude, for Affiance in Perplexities.</hi> The Temper of a <hi>Legal Spirit</hi> in
this Point is fitly express'd, <hi>Psal. 116. 10. 11. I was greatly afflicted, I said in
my hast: All men are Lyars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While our Comforts depend upon the <hi>Forms</hi> of our Saviour's Appearing to
us, either <hi>Inwardly,</hi> or <hi>Outwardly:</hi> we are, as cast off, and at a Loss upon every
Change. When a Temptation, or unexpected Trouble ariseth, we are like a
Ship in a Storm, that hath lost its Anchor. We are carried away with the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Tempest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> cry:</hi> All our Signs for Good have deceived us. All the Marks of
Divine Love, which men have given us, all the Encouragements, and Comforts,
with which they have carried us on: All the Manifestations, and Workings, which
we discovered, as Grounds of Assurance, in our own Hearts; All these have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
us. Good God whom, or what shall we trust? What shall we do, that we
may have rest in the Time of Trouble?</p>
            <p>This is the uncertainty of his Comforts, who is under the Law, who hath
not all his Comforts, and Confidence wrapt up in One Spirit with Jesus Christ,
who is the <hi>Same,</hi> without Change, in the midst of all Changes; <hi>Yesterday, and
to Day.</hi> It is this alone, which can make us sweetly to Rejoyce in our Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Tribulations.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Solicitude: for Light in the way.</hi> While the <hi>Law</hi> is our <hi>School-master,</hi> the
<hi>Letter</hi> is our <hi>Way,</hi> and <hi>Guide.</hi> The <hi>Letter</hi> hath a <hi>Twofold Inconvenience</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Way</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> is cut out into great <hi>Diversity of Paths.</hi> It is
full of Windings, and Turnings. It hath manifold Rites, and Observations in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Letter</hi> itself is <hi>Old, and Dim.</hi> So the Directions, which it gives
us are very Dark, and uncertain to us.</p>
            <p>These Two Inconveniences make us perpetually full of Disputes, and Doubts
in our selves, every step, that we take, whether we be in a right way, or no.</p>
            <p>We never can be delivered from this Solicitude, till we be brought into the
High, and Plain way of the Spirit, in which the wayfaring Man, though a
Fool, cannot erre.</p>
            <p>4. Solicitude: For Life in the Work of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. The Law being
weak thorow the Flesh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 16. Iesus Christ is made a Priest, not after
the Law of a Carnal Command; but after the Power of an Endless Life.</p>
            <p>The Life of Grace under the Law is very Weak. For the way of its Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is by Fleshly Principles. It is so conveyed thorow them, as if it were
wrought out of them altogether.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:49838:44"/>
In this State the Soul eats the Bread of Life, with the Sweat of her Brows.
She is fain to till an Earth full of Bryars, and Thorns. She carries on the
Working of Grace with much Difficulty for the present, and Anxiety for the
Future. For the Life of Grace is weak, and it puts forth itself after the Way
of the Life of Reason, by Parts, Affections, Passions, Resolution, Industry.
This way of Working by these Powers naturally carrieth along with it much
Care, and Vexation. Whereas under the Gospel the New Earth bringeth forth
the Fruit of the Spirit of its own accord, according to the several Seasons, and
Growths of it. And this is done, while the Husbandman sleepeth, while the
Spirit lies sweetly at Rest in the Bosom of her Saviour without any Care, or
Toil.</p>
            <p>The Life of Grace in the Law, is as Water drawn up out of a Deep Well
by Buckets-full at a time. But in the Gospel it is a Living Fountain springing
up Freely, Plentifully, Uncessantly.</p>
            <p>So much for the <hi>Signs</hi> of a <hi>Servile,</hi> or <hi>Legal State</hi> in Religion.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this <hi>Head</hi> with one <hi>Use</hi> of <hi>Consolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use. Consolation.</hi> You, who feel not your selves carried up into the Glory of
God by the Spirit, as upon the Wing of an Eagle; but are creeping towards
Heaven, like Worms upon the Ground: you have great <hi>Priviledges</hi> belonging
to you, and a great Portion of Comfort.</p>
            <p>Your <hi>Priviledges,</hi> in which you that are under the <hi>Law,</hi> may Glory, and
take <hi>Comfort,</hi> are these:</p>
            <p>You have an <hi>Adoption,</hi> or <hi>Son-ship;</hi> a <hi>Protection;</hi> a <hi>Presence of Glory;</hi> a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Worship;</hi> a <hi>Pledge, and Type,</hi> you may have a <hi>Precious Seed</hi> in you.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Priviledge: Adoption,</hi> or <hi>Son-ship. Rom.</hi> 9. 4. You are the <hi>Israelites</hi> in
the <hi>Letter,</hi> or <hi>Flesh, to whom pertaineth the Adoption.</hi> God is your Father in a
more especial way, than to the Rest of Men, in a nearer Relation, than that
of Creation. You are Sons, though by the Bond-woman. You are begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
of God into a New Image of Himself: though this Image be in the
Flesh, and of the Flesh, as the Mother.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Priviledge: Protection.</hi> God was with all his Thousands of Angels on
Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in the midst of the Fire, and Thick Darkness. This was an <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi>
and signified thy Heart with its Fears and Agonies under the Law; in
the midst of which God, and His Angels dwell, as a Defence over thee. <hi>The
Law was added because of Transgressions:</hi> to Protect thee from the Power of
the Devil in thy Lusts, and Corruptions.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Priviledge: the Presence of Glory.</hi> This is reckoned up, <hi>Rom. 9. 4.
The Glory.</hi> The Glory is some Manifestation above the Work of Nature, sent
forth from God, and having God present in it, conversing with us by it. Such
was the <hi>Pillar</hi> in the Wilderness; such the Smoak in the Temple; the <hi>Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> at the <hi>Oracle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:49838:44"/>
Thou also who fearest God, and workest Righteousness, though under the
Law; yet hast a Glorious Work of God upon thy Heart, a Divine Appearance
of God in thy Spirit, a near Presence of God with it; by which thou hast
Access to Him, and Communion with him.</p>
            <p>We read of those that are <hi>near,</hi> and those, that are <hi>far off.</hi> Thou in the
State of <hi>Nature</hi> wast <hi>far</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f from God. Now being brought under the <hi>Law,</hi>
thou art <hi>near</hi> to Him. When thou shalt be brought up into the Light of the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> thou wilt see thy self <hi>in Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Priviledge: Peculiar Worship. The Covenants; the giving of the Law;
The Service of God pertained to the Israelites:</hi> Rom. 9. 3. Thou art an Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,
a Kinsman of Christ, and all the Saints, nay a Brother according to the
Flesh: if thou hast the Work of the Law upon thy Heart. The Covenant,
nay both Covenants, in the Letter, in the Outward Dispensation, and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
belong to thee. Thou hast a Right to all the Ordinances, and to every
Instituted Service of God. The Promises in the Proposal of them concern
thee in the First Place.</p>
            <p>Go then to the Sacraments; Pray; Read the Word; Hearken to the
Promises; whatever thy Troubles, or Terrours be. These are appointed for
thee to keep, to Comfort, to carry thee on, till Christ be revealed in thee.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Priviledge: The Pledge, and Type</hi> of Spiritual and Eternal things, <hi>Rom.</hi>
9. 4. The <hi>Promises;</hi> The <hi>Fathers; Christ according to the Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When thou feelest the Bondage of the Law to lie heaviest upon thee, thou
hast this to comfort thy self with: All the Saints of old, in whose Loyns, the
Life, and Heirs of all Grace, and Glory lay; lived in this State, and were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Law, even until death: Jesus Christ Himself was born of Legal
Parents, and made under the Law.</p>
            <p>Besides; The Law is a Fleshly Image of all the Joys of the Gospel, and
the Spirit, and Heaven. The Law holds them forth all, not in the <hi>Type,</hi> or
Image only; but in the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of them, as being certainly <hi>to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> go together, and Moses himself is One of the Chief
of the Prophets.</p>
            <p>As Christ according to the Flesh was an Israelite, so the Law is the Beauty,
and Glory of Christ in the Flesh, testifying of itself, and its own coming in
the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Sit down then under thy <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> under the Shadow of the Law, with
good <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> till thy Vine be grown up. There look on Him, who seeth
thee. Behold that Glory, which looks forth in the Law, as in a Fleshly Image
of itself. Feed thy self with the Expectations of his Shining out, whom this
Image prophesies of to thee. When he discovers himself, thou shalt know,
that He was in Covenant, and Communion with thee, even when thou wert
under the <hi>Fig-tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:49838:45"/>
6. <hi>Priviledge:</hi> You may have a <hi>Precious Seed</hi> in you. While you are Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
you are in Bondage to many Fears, and Terrours: You weep, for you
say; you can discover nothing of Christ in you. It is true the Seed is not
come up yet; but it may be Sown. You come not Rejoycing, and bearing your
Sheafs with you: yet you may be those, who go forth weeping, and carrying
your Precious Seed with you.</p>
            <p>When Darkness would drive you to Despair, then take to your selves the
words of St. <hi>Paul, Gal. 3. 23. Before Faith</hi> (that is, the Revelation of Christ
in my Flesh) <hi>I am kept under the Law,</hi> under Terrours, and Rigours; <hi>Shut up
in Darkness</hi> and Fear, from all Comforts, or Confidence <hi>unto the Faith,</hi> (that
Appearance of Christ) <hi>which shall be revealed;</hi> but now is hid, as a Seed only
in me.</p>
            <p>Though thou canst not yet with good old <hi>Simeon,</hi> sing over Jesus Christ in
thine Arms, a Song of Peace, and Rest to thy Soul: yet thou mayst with <hi>Mary</hi>
have him in thy Womb. This <hi>Burthen,</hi> which thou bearest, and goest with so
heavily, may be the <hi>Burthen</hi> of the Lord, the Immortal Word in thee.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Pangs,</hi> which thou feelest may be, not to the Death of thy Soul, but
the Birth of a <hi>Son,</hi> a Saviour, whose coming forth shall make thee to forget all
thy Sorrows, and Rejoyce; because a <hi>Son</hi> is born unto thee, by which Birth
thou art no more a <hi>Servant,</hi> but a <hi>Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now done speaking of the <hi>Servile,</hi> and come to the <hi>Son-like State</hi> in

            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>The Sonship of a Saint.</hi> This is the Union of a Saint in one Spirit with
him, who is the only begotten Son of the Father, Jesus Christ. It is the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of the Person of a Saint in one Life, one Image with the Person of
his blessed Saviour. The <hi>Apostle</hi> unites these <hi>two: our being Sons;</hi> and <hi>our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Spirit of his Son.</hi> And that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place calls <hi>The Spirit
of His Son:</hi> he calls <hi>the Spirit of Adoption,</hi> Rom. 8. 15. That Spirit, which
is the Spirit of all the Sons of God.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Concealment of this Sonship.</hi> The coming of the Spirit into our Souls
doth not <hi>make</hi> us Sons, but <hi>manifests</hi> us to be such. We are <hi>First</hi> Sons, and <hi>then</hi>
the Spirit of his Son is sent forth into our Spirits. So we read plainly: <hi>Because
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49838:45"/>
ye are Sons, he hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While we live in sin and slavery, we are in truth Sons, though we be, as
<hi>Princes in disguise.</hi> Yet ever God retains in himself, the <hi>Root,</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> of
our Persons, as of Sons.</p>
            <p>So our State of Sonship is <hi>twice hid: once</hi> in the <hi>Secret</hi> of divine Glory:
<hi>again</hi> under the <hi>Shadow</hi> of our Flesh.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Discovery of this Sonship.</hi> This is by the <hi>sending of the Spirit into
our Hearts.</hi> This Spirit is <hi>manifold.</hi> Ephes. 4. 3. <hi>Keeping the unity of the Spirit
in the bond of peace.</hi> Where the <hi>Unity</hi> is kept by a <hi>Bond,</hi> there a <hi>Multiplicity</hi> is
clearly signified.</p>
            <p>1 Cor. 12. 13. <hi>We are all baptized by one Spirit into one Body.</hi> Christ and
his Saints are there spoken of. All these together are one <hi>Body</hi> of Divinity, and
Glory. Each particular Saint is a Member of this Glory, a Son, or Child of
this Divinity. Each one hath the same <hi>Spirit,</hi> which comprehends all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of our Saviour, and his Brethren.</p>
            <p>God in his own time sends down this Spirit upon every one of his Sons.
When it comes, it discovereth in itself, thy Saviours Person, and thine, in one
Light, Life, and Form; in one Relation to God, as being both <hi>Sons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Spirit</hi> shining forth in thy Spirit, shews itself at once, One with God,
and One with Thee. So it becomes both the <hi>Witness,</hi> and the <hi>Evidence</hi> of thy
Relation to God, as of a Son to a Father.</p>
            <p>Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us: <hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit beareth witness
with our Spirits, that we are the Sons of God.</hi> The Spirit is the <hi>Brightness</hi> of
the Godhead; which, as it descends into our bosoms, opens the Godhead to
us, there discovers us to our selves, as we were Eternally <hi>comprehended</hi> in that
<hi>Root,</hi> as we <hi>grow</hi> up out of it, as we <hi>abide,</hi> and flourish in it.</p>
            <p>This Spirit being immediately united to God, immediately united to our
Spirits, is an immediate Testimony of our Sonship.</p>
            <p>4, <hi>The Effect of this Discovery. He hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into
our Hearts, crying; Abba, Father.</hi> The natural <hi>Effect</hi> of our Sonship made
manifest in us is a natural <hi>Affection</hi> to our Father. While we are in the State of
Nature we know not whence we come, nor whither we go, when once we
have received the Spirit of Sons, we then see God to be the Father, who did
bear us in his Loyns from Eternity, who brought us forth into this World;
who can never forget us, though a Woman should forget her only Child; who
hath ever Bowels of a Father, care, tenderness, sweetness towards us; who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
always hold, but He must discover himself to us.</p>
            <p>When a Saint feels these Workings of the Spirit of God in his own Spirit,
then his Bowels turn within him, then he melts, then he casts himself into the
Embraces of his God, and cries; <hi>My Father: Abba, Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus God gives a Check to our Lusts, changing them into a divine Love,
<hi>by Discovery.</hi>

This is the <hi>First place</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Scripture. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 16. 17. He that dwells in Love, dwells in God,
and God dwells in him. For God is <hi>Love.</hi> In this is Love made perfect, that we
may have Boldness before him in the day of Iudgment. Because, as He is, so are
we in this World.</p>
            <p>Two things are taught us in these words:
<list>
                  <item>1. The Relation between God, and a Saint in an Evangelical State.</item>
                  <item>2. The Affection of such a Saint towards God.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Relation between God, and a Saint in an Evangelical State. <hi>The
Relation between a Father, and a Son in</hi> Nature <hi>hath</hi> three Parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Part.</hi> The Nature of the Father is in the Person of the Son. It is one
in both, as the Sap, and Seminal Power is the same thorow the whole Tree.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Part.</hi> The Person of the Son subsists in the Nature of the Father; as
the Body of the Tree in the Root.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Part.</hi> The Person of the Father propagates and multiplies itself in the
Person of the Son; as the Body of a Tree runs out into Branches.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Such a Relation with so many Parts is there between God, and a Saint, as
between Father and Son.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Part.</hi> The Divine nature is in the Person of a Saint, as the <hi>Fountain</hi>
of his Being, the <hi>Fulness</hi> of his Person. Thus St. <hi>John</hi> saith: <hi>We dwell in
God;</hi> not in the <hi>Fleshly Image</hi> of God, as a Servile Christian; but in the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Image,</hi> the naked Bosom of the Godhead.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Part.</hi> The Person of a Saint is in the Divine Nature, as in his Root, in
his Element, in his proper <hi>Principle;</hi> as that, which <hi>comprehends</hi> him, <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi>
itself to him, <hi>sustains</hi> him, <hi>flows</hi> in upon him, <hi>shows</hi> itself in all things,
<hi>possesseth, acts</hi> him entirely. Thus saith St. <hi>John: We dwell in God:</hi> that is, as
a Worldly Spirit dwells in the Spirit of this World.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Part.</hi> God propagates himself in a Saint. Both are one Life, one Spirit
multiplying itself into various Forms: Both unitedly, and in One, pass thorow
all Forms. So St. <hi>John</hi> again teacheth: <hi>As He is, so are we in this World.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>This is the <hi>Relation</hi> between God, and a Saint in an Evangelical State, as
that between a Father and a Son.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Affection of a Son-like Saint towards God.</hi> To dwell in <hi>God,</hi> and
dwell in <hi>Love:</hi> to have <hi>God,</hi> and to have <hi>Love</hi> dwelling in us, are both One
thing. For <hi>God is Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is an Infinite Sweetness, which is both <hi>Fountain,</hi> and <hi>Sea</hi> in one: a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sending forth many Streams, many Sons: a Sea drawing all into its own
Bosom again by a Natural course.</p>
            <p>He then that is a Son of <hi>God</hi> is a Son of <hi>Love:</hi> Love of that first Love,
coming forth from it, and returning thither, whence it first came.</p>
            <p>This Son-like or <hi>Filial Love</hi> hath <hi>Two Characters.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Character: The Degree of Love, Love</hi> in a Son-like Saint riseth to a
Confidence, a Boldness in the presence of God, even then, when he puts on the
most terrible Appearance in the day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ground</hi> of this Boldness in a Filial love is <hi>Three-fold.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Reason.</hi> A Saint, that is, a Son, knows, and feels God to be <hi>Love.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Reason.</hi> He knows himself to be in this <hi>Love,</hi> to be One with God in
his Heavenly Glory.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Reason.</hi> He knows this <hi>Love</hi> to be in him, God to be one with him in
his worldly Disguise: <hi>We have boldness; because as he is, so are we</hi> in this World.
All these <hi>Three Reasons</hi> are wrapt up in this <hi>One Clause.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>As he is in the World; <hi>Love itself:</hi> so are we with Him, sensible of Him.</p>
            <p>As He is in the World, and at once <hi>above the World, in Glory:</hi> so are we in Him.</p>
            <p>As he is in the World, <hi>clothing his Divine Substance with Fleshly Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi>
so are we, because he is in us. This is the <hi>first Character</hi> of a Filial Love.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Character: Extent of Love.</hi> A Saint, that is a Son, hath not a <hi>particular</hi>
Love to God, or any Object. He is, as his Father is, Love in its full Latitude. <hi>He
dwells in Love.</hi> Love is the <hi>Air,</hi> in which he breaths, in which he receives all
Shapes of things, in which he communicates himself to them.</p>
            <p>A Son of God is like his Father in <hi>Two Things:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. He is a beautiful Light shining upon all things equally, stamping its
own bright Form upon them, so beholding them.</item>
                  <item>2. He is a Cloud of Sweetness, like gentle and soft Rain falling upon every
thing, till it have sweetned it by degrees to the same height; and enjoying it
in that Sweetness:</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Make <hi>God</hi> your only <hi>Mark,</hi> and Aim. What is it, which you
seek for? <hi>Love?</hi> God is <hi>Love.</hi> What is it, which makes every Action, or suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
sweet? This, if <hi>Love</hi> be the beginning. What gives you Rest in every
End of things? <hi>Love.</hi> Then seek <hi>God</hi> above all things. Make him the <hi>Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
and the <hi>End</hi> of your way. So you shall have a sweet Rest in all. For He
is <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How strange is that perverseness, which is in the Nature of man! When
man was first made, he was placed in a Garden, where he had liberty to eat of
all the Trees, excepting one Tree only, which bare all manner of Curses for
Fruit, the <hi>Forbidden Tree.</hi> Yet then man eats of this one Tree, and lets the
rest alone. Now all the Trees in the same Garden, which are all Creatures in
the World, have wo, and death growing upon them. There is one Tree only
in the m'dst of the Garden bringing forth Glory, and Immortality. This Tree
is <hi>God.</hi> Now man will feed plentifully on all the other Trees; but will not
touch this <hi>Tree of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49838:47"/>
We all have <hi>Notions</hi> in our heads, and <hi>Expressions</hi> upon our Tongues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>God;</hi> that, if we speak of Wisdom, <hi>He is Wise;</hi> if we speak of
Strength, He hath <hi>power;</hi> if we speak of Glory, He is <hi>beautiful;</hi> if we speak
of Joy, and Delights, He is <hi>sweet.</hi> But oh that there were such Hearts in us to set
up this <hi>God</hi> in our Spirits for the supream <hi>Wisdom, Power, Beauty, Sweetness!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will divide this <hi>Exhortation</hi> into <hi>Three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Exhortation. Seek the Knowledge of God.</hi> As our Saviour once spake
passionately over the Jews: O <hi>Hierusalem, Hierusalem, if thou hadst known the
things of thy peace!</hi> In like passion doth my Spirit breath forth this over you,
that now read it: O <hi>Man!</hi> O <hi>Woman! If thou knewest the One thing of thy
Peace, the Knowledge of thy God.</hi> This is the Chief, the only thing, the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
of thy Peace. For when thou knowest him, thou knowest <hi>Love</hi> in
truth, the Life of Love; and this is Eternal Life. <hi>John 17. 4. This is Eternal
Life to know thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Press the knowledge of God upon thy Spirit by these <hi>Three Motives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Motive: The Knowledge of God is the Inlet of all Grace, and Comfort,</hi>
Rom. 10. 14. <hi>How shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard?</hi>
If Faith be the mother, and nurse of a Spiritual Life; the knowledge of God
is the Father, and the Food of Faith, and of that. If Faith be the Fountain, that
sends forth the Streams of Divine Strengths, and Consolations; the Knowledge
of God is the Sea that supplies this Spring.</p>
            <p>Rom. 10. 17. <hi>Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God.</hi>
The <hi>Word</hi> of God is the <hi>Image</hi> of God, which is Jesus Christ. This <hi>Word</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
itself <hi>Three ways: Eternally: Internally: Externally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Eternally</hi> the Word of God represents itself to Glorified Spirits. That
<hi>Knowledge</hi> of God, which is begotten upon the Spirit by this Representation
is call'd <hi>Seeing.</hi> For it is a Representation in a clear Light, as before a man,
as face to face. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. last, <hi>Seen of Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Internally</hi> to men on Earth by the Principles of <hi>Natural Reason,</hi> or by
<hi>Supernatural Principles</hi> from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or from the <hi>Written Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Externally</hi> by the outward Creatures, by the Senses, and Objects of
Sense. These two last ways of Representation are call'd; <hi>Hearing</hi> or <hi>Report.</hi> For
they are Representations of God conveyed thorow the darkness of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as a Voice speaking from behind us, from behind the <hi>wall</hi> of our <hi>Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God is pleased thus to give his Word, to put forth a Discovery of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
thorow our dark Principles, as by the Hearing of the Ear, in our Souls;
then God, in all that he appears to <hi>be,</hi> appears to be <hi>Love.</hi> This Sense of God
thus imprest upon the Heart, <hi>unites</hi> it to God, makes it to <hi>believe</hi> him, trust it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to him, repose itself on him, rest in him, leave its desires, and hopes with
him; that as He lives, so this Heart may live; as he works, and carries on his
own Desire, so he may work on this Heart, and advance the Happiness of it.
Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s <hi>Faith cometh by Hearing.</hi>

               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:49838:47"/>
Hear then what <hi>Nature</hi> without you, speaks aloud of God: that He is good,
true, just, full and free. Listen to that report, which is made of God by all
your <hi>Senses,</hi> by all the things of Sense, in the several Languages of their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Power, Plenty, Pleasure, Variety.</p>
            <p>Listen to the inbred voice of your own <hi>Reason.</hi> Hear the clear report, which
that makes of God; that there must be <hi>One,</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> and so the <hi>Best</hi> of all;
<hi>above</hi> All, <hi>in</hi> All, gathering up all into himself; the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of
All.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Listen to</hi> Supernatural Principles. <hi>If you cannot hear, or understand the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the</hi> Spirit; <hi>yet hearken to the sound of the</hi> Written Word, <hi>which
cries in your Ears:</hi> God gave his Love, and Glory to man, before he gave a Being
to the World. When man had made himself Miserable, God gave Himself to misery,
and death for man: God all along quite thorow Time to Eternity carries on this
work of making himself wonderful in man, and Man a wonder of Blessedness in
Him.</p>
            <p>He that stops not his Ears against these sweet Reports of such a <hi>God,</hi> a God
of <hi>Love,</hi> cannot but be charmed by them. A man that <hi>hears</hi> this, will <hi>beleive,</hi>
he will at least cast himself on <hi>God,</hi> and say: <hi>Whither-ever thou goest, carry
me with thee: Where ever thou stayest, be thou my Rest. To thee only,</hi> O <hi>my God;
to thee entirely,</hi> O <hi>my Love, do I trust my self.</hi> This is the <hi>first Motive</hi> to the
knowledge of God.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Motive: The Knowledge of God emproves, and exalts the Soul.</hi> Psal. 90.
14. <hi>I,</hi> saith God, <hi>will set him up on high, because he hath known my name.</hi> None
can tell, but they, who have tasted, what a Divine Height, what a Height of
Divine Strength, and sweetness there is in the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God. <hi>I will set him
on high:</hi> the word in <hi>Hebrew</hi> signifies: <hi>I will seat him in a strong Castle situate
on a high Rock.</hi> Such a Castle is the Knowledge of God for <hi>Air, Prospect,</hi> and
<hi>Strength.</hi> As a man grows in the Knowledge of God; he feels himself lifted up
into a Divine <hi>air,</hi> in which purity, peace, pleasure, Angels breath; he perceives
himself <hi>walled</hi> in with an assured safety, and rest, which nothing can reach,
nothing can shake.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God opens a man's Eyes, to <hi>see</hi> Fields of Glory, and
Rivers of pleasure, in the midst of which he is every where; together with
Horses of Fire, and Chariots of Fire, which continually plant themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him, and every Enemy.</p>
            <p>3. Motive: The Knowledge of God preserves a man from Evil. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.
9. After that ye have Known God, or rather are known of him, how come ye to
turn back to those weak, and beggarly Principles, to which ye desire to be in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Beggarly Principles</hi> are the Principles of this world, in which we lye
by nature, as in a <hi>Prison,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n a House of Bondage, where Sin binds us, Shame

covers us, Death feeds upon us. What shall deliver us from this Prison, this
Slavery? The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of God will do it, and that alone can do it.</p>
            <p>When God puts forth his own Image in us, he then owns us, and makes us
to know, and own him. Thus we know, and are known by this Image of God
living in our Spirits. As the <hi>Serpent</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> devoured the <hi>Serpents</hi> of the
<hi>Magicians:</hi> So this <hi>Image</hi> of God in our Spirits swallows up all the <hi>Images</hi> and
<hi>Shapes</hi> of this inchanting World, which are as <hi>Serpents</hi> tempting, and stinging
us, casting forth the Poyson of Sin, and death upon us. This <hi>Image presents</hi>
us with Heavenly Forms; <hi>plants</hi> us in itself; <hi>cloths</hi> us with itself; so furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
us with <hi>Treasure,</hi> and <hi>Armour.</hi> Now having thus known God, and the
sweet Freedom of his Love; how can we desire, or bear to be again in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to our former Vanities.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Motive: the Discovery of God shews us, all, that our hearts cau wish to
see.</hi> Psal. 37. 4. You have this Counsel given you: <hi>Delight thy self in the
Lord, and he shall give thee thy hearts desire.</hi> Acquaint thy self with the Lord,
and he shall shew thee thy hearts desire, in shewing thee himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is God?</hi> Esa. 57. 15. <hi>He is the High and Holy One, that inhabits Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
What then shalt thou <hi>see</hi> in the Discovery of God? Thou shalt <hi>see</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
and Joy at their Height, and fixt there, unchangeable, Eternal, as
Eternity itself; without any <hi>Change,</hi> which is the <hi>cause</hi> of all Loss, and Death;
without any <hi>Shadow</hi> of Change, which makes all Fear and Melancholy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is God? See</hi> by Jesus Christ, who is the Image of God. You read of
him: <hi>Ephes. 1. 10. God hath gathered up all things into One, in Him.</hi> What
then shalt thou <hi>see</hi> in the Appearance of God? Thou shalt <hi>see</hi> all those Forms
of things, which affrighted, and opprest thee in <hi>Shapes</hi> as Delightful, as Delight
itself. For thou shalt <hi>see</hi> all things <hi>in One, in Christ.</hi> Thou shalt <hi>see</hi> all Varieties
of things in <hi>One Beauty,</hi> as the various <hi>Mixtures</hi> of that with itself, or <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi>
in itself. Thou shalt <hi>see</hi> thy self immortal in a State of full Glory:
according to that, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks: 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. The Grace, which was
given us in Christ, before the World was.</hi> Thou shalt <hi>see</hi> those dear Relations,
those sweet Contents, which thou hast lost, and over which thou bitterly
mournest, breaking thine Heart; or which thou fearest to lose, and so livest ever
trembling in this Fear: Thou shalt <hi>see</hi> all these living together in one Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
present before thee in one view, never to die, never to be lost, when
once thou seest God in thy Soul. <hi>For all things live to God.</hi> Thy dead Joys are
still living in him; <hi>Death</hi> itself, which kill'd them, and threatens thee, lives a
<hi>lovely life</hi> there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What is God? God is Love.</hi> What then shalt thou <hi>see,</hi> when thou seest God?
Thou shalt <hi>see</hi> a pure, unmixt, absolute, unconfin'd <hi>Love.</hi> Thou shalt <hi>see</hi> all
things having their Being in <hi>Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> because they have their Being in <hi>God.</hi> Thou
shalt <hi>see</hi> all things animated by a Life of <hi>Love,</hi> inspired by a Spirit of <hi>Love:</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:49838:48"/>
because <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>Quickning Spirit</hi> of all. O <hi>Sweet Sight!</hi> To see every thing
<hi>quickned</hi> by <hi>Love,</hi> and so made perfectly <hi>Loving;</hi> every thing <hi>clothed</hi> with
<hi>Love,</hi> and so made perfectly <hi>Lovely.</hi> This he <hi>sees,</hi> that <hi>sees</hi> God made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now, as the</hi> Woman <hi>said of our</hi> Saviour: Behold a man, that hath told me
all, that ever was in my heart: <hi>may not we say this of the</hi> Knowledge <hi>of God:</hi>
Behold a Light, in which you shall see all, that ever was in your heart to hope,
wish, or imagine?</p>
            <p>Is not this the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which is sweeter than Honey? Richer than Pearl?
Better for traffick than fine Gold? Even the <hi>Knowledge of God,</hi> in the opening
of which, all delights flow forth, all Beauties sparkle, all wares of Blessedness
offer themselves, and press in upon your Spirits, Seek then the <hi>Knowledge of
God</hi> in the <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>last</hi> place, in all places, for it is in the <hi>place</hi> of all things.</p>
            <p>This is the first Exhortation.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Exhortation: Let nothing keep you at a distance from God?</hi> Where can
you be so well, as in the Bosom of Him, who <hi>loves</hi> you? Nay, who is <hi>Love?</hi>
Nay who is <hi>Love</hi> to you if you will receive Him? For he is <hi>all Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever departs from <hi>God,</hi> departs from <hi>Love,</hi> and goes towards <hi>Wrath,</hi>
Enmity, Hatred, take heed how you trust your self to any thing, that tempts
you from <hi>God,</hi> whatever it pretends: It cannot come from <hi>Love,</hi> or bring
<hi>Love</hi> with it. It is an <hi>Enemy,</hi> and seeks to betray you by winning you from
your sweetest Strength. The <hi>Blossom</hi> of a Vanity, or Sin may be fair to the
Eye. But <hi>Hatred</hi> is the <hi>Root,</hi> and will be the <hi>Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every thing of <hi>Love</hi> is of <hi>God,</hi> and carries the heart to God. <hi>Hatred,</hi> faith
<hi>Solomon breeds strife.</hi> Canst thou look for <hi>Peace,</hi> I say not, <hi>Pleasure,</hi> in that
Temptation, which draws thee down from <hi>Love</hi> into <hi>Hatred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Exhortation: Walk worthy of God;</hi> If you be <hi>His Sons,</hi> you are Sons
of <hi>Love;</hi> a <hi>Love</hi> which is untainted with Particular respects; a <hi>Love,</hi> which
is Invincible by any unsuitableness, or opposition, a Divine Love. Cherish such
a <hi>Love</hi> in your selves, shew it to others.</p>
            <p>Let your <hi>Love</hi> be your <hi>Selves,</hi> as it is in <hi>God,</hi> that you may as soon cease to
<hi>be,</hi> as cease to <hi>Love.</hi> Let <hi>Love</hi> appear, wherever you appear like your Selves.
Let your <hi>Love</hi> be as Universal, as your Conversation. Let it be your <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let your <hi>Love</hi> be like <hi>Aarons Ointment</hi> poured forth upon the <hi>Head</hi> of
things, the <hi>Godhead,</hi> and running down thorow all the <hi>Creatures,</hi> to the very
lowest <hi>Skirts,</hi> the <hi>least</hi> of Things.</p>
            <p>Be you <hi>Love,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> is. Love <hi>exalteth not itself.</hi> For it dwelleth with all
things as <hi>One,</hi> in <hi>One. Love thinketh no Evil.</hi> For it looketh upon all things
<hi>thorow One,</hi> and judgeth of them, as they appear <hi>in that One. Love is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry.</hi>
For <hi>Union</hi> is its Life, and all its Streams are sent forth from that sweet
Spring. <hi>Love is not suspicious.</hi> For it makes itself <hi>One</hi> with All, and gathers
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49838:49"/>
up all into <hi>One Principle</hi> with itself. <hi>Love worketh no ill.</hi> For it possesseth,
converseth with, enjoys each several thing <hi>in One.</hi> So every thing to <hi>Love</hi> is
<hi>Love's Self.</hi> Thus <hi>God is Love.</hi> Thus be <hi>you,</hi> if you be <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> This is
to be <hi>Perfect, as your heavenly Father is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Property: Life,</hi> Heb. 7. 16. <hi>Who,</hi> (that is, Christ) <hi>was not made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of a carnal command, but the power of an Endless Life.</hi> A
Comparison is made in this Scripture between the Priesthood of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and
our blessed <hi>Saviour. Aaron</hi> was a Priest of the first Covenant, the Law: The
Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> was the Priest of the New Covenant, the Gospel. He that lives
under the Priesthood of the One, is a <hi>Servant.</hi> He that lives under the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of the Other, is a <hi>Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have a <hi>Threefold Opposition</hi> between these <hi>Two States,</hi> the <hi>Servile,</hi> and
the <hi>Son-like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First Opposition</hi> is between <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> A <hi>Law</hi> is something <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi>
a <hi>Compact,</hi> a Treaty between Two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Life</hi> is something <hi>Inbred.</hi> A <hi>Principle,</hi>
a Spring, a Unity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Opposition</hi> is between a <hi>Law-command,</hi> and a <hi>Life-power,</hi> A
<hi>Command</hi> works by violence, and force, from without, uncertainly: A <hi>Power</hi>
of Life works kindly, constantly, inwardly, and sweetly.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third Opposition</hi> is between <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Eternity. The Law of a Carnal
Command,</hi> a carnal, or <hi>Fleshly</hi> Command decays, and dies, it begins, and ends
in <hi>Time,</hi> as every thing of <hi>Flesh</hi> doth. But the <hi>Gospel</hi> is the <hi>Power of an End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He, that lives, as a <hi>Servant</hi> under the Law, lives in <hi>Fleshly</hi> Principles, which
are frail, false, and fading. The <hi>impressions,</hi> which he hath of goodness are
made by terrour, and work unkindly. They are like Images in <hi>water,</hi> dark;
ever vanishing, if they be not maintained by outward objects, Ordinances,
Duties, Sermons, Books, Men.</p>
            <p>He, that lives, as a <hi>Son,</hi> under the Gospel, lives in a <hi>Divine Principle,</hi> is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
good. If you ask, why this man is good against the stream of all earthly
things, which are evil. It is his <hi>Nature</hi> to be so. For he is <hi>made partaker of the
Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. If you ask, how he comes to love, imitate, grow
up into an unseen Glory, the Eternal Spirit. It is his <hi>Life</hi> to do so. As every
Plant hath its proper <hi>Life,</hi> by which it is formed, and grows. So to this man
his God, his Jesus is his <hi>Life.</hi> You may wonder, that a Son of God should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
flow forth into Spiritual Discourses; continually bath himself, in high,
hidden, heavenly Joys; continually be mastering Lusts, and Passions, in des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight
of Temptations without, and within him; continually maintain a Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Lovely temper in this froward world. But all this is no wonder, for he
is carried on by <hi>the Power of an Endless</hi> (indissoluble, invincible) <hi>life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Second Property</hi> of a <hi>Son-like State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:49838:49"/>
3. Property: Spirituality, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 3. 1. I could not speak to you, as unto
Spiritual, but as unto Carnal, Babes in Christ. <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 1. The Heir, while he
is a Child, differs nothing at all from a Servant, though he be Lord of all. <hi>These</hi>
two places <hi>laid together shew, that a</hi> Babe <hi>in Christ, and</hi> Servant <hi>in religion
are both the samething; as also, that a</hi> Servant <hi>and a</hi> Son <hi>are distinguished by
their</hi> Spirituality, <hi>and</hi> Carnality. <hi>He is a</hi> Son, <hi>that is</hi> Spiritual.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> giveth <hi>Two Descriptions</hi> of <hi>Spirituality</hi> in this <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Description: Spirituality feeds itself on Meat, not on Milk. v. 2. I could
not feed you with Meat, but with Milk. A Spiritual <hi>Person feeds, and lives on</hi>
Divine things; <hi>not only, as they are</hi> represented <hi>in</hi> Fleshly Types, <hi>and Images;
but as they are</hi> presented <hi>in their</hi> own Shape, <hi>and Figures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> complains of <hi>Nicodemus:</hi> John 3. 12. <hi>If I have spoken to you
of Earthly things, and you receive them not: how would you understand them, if
I should speak of Heavenly.</hi> If now you do not understand me, when I speak
of Heavenly things in an <hi>Earthly manner,</hi> by resemblances taken from below:
how would you take in, or bear Heavenly things express'd in their <hi>own language,</hi>
set before you in their own form, and Glories.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Heathens</hi> have a Fable of <hi>Semele,</hi> a Lady, who had the chief God for
her Lover. She desired that she might see him in the Form, and Majesty of a
God. She had her desire, and dyed, <hi>opprest</hi> by the weight of Glory. In like
manner, if you should shew the mysteries of God, and the Gospel to low, and
legal Spirits by <hi>their own Light,</hi> without the <hi>Shadowings</hi> of <hi>Fleshly</hi> Similitudes,
and Parables; you would undo their Religion, confound their understandings,
drive them to <hi>despair, deadness,</hi> or <hi>profaneness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Description</hi> of <hi>Spirituality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Description: Spirituality keeps the Unity of things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. While
there are divisions among you, are you not carnal? <hi>Every thing is</hi> Carnal, <hi>which
makes</hi> Division; <hi>that alone is</hi> Spiritual <hi>which maintains the</hi> Unity.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Gen. 28. Man</hi> was made in the Image of God, and to have dominion
over all the Fowl, Fish, and Beasts. <hi>Man</hi> was the <hi>Harmony,</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> of this
lower World. He knits up into one Frame of Life, and Beauty the divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of all the several Creatures. Thus he was the Image of God. This <hi>First,
Earthly</hi> man was the <hi>Type</hi> only of the Second, the <hi>Spiritual</hi> man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 18. Many are blamed, not so much for looking into the Nature
of <hi>Angels,</hi> as for not looking upon them by a right <hi>Light,</hi> in a right <hi>Posture:
Not holding the Head:</hi> Not beholding the various glories of Angels in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Unity</hi> of Christ's Person.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Spiritual</hi> man takes not away the Differences of things, he allows, owns
them in their utmost variety, latitude, and distance. But he tunes them, and
attones them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 23, 25. St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes the Body of man a Figure
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49838:50"/>
of this truth. <hi>There are many Members. The greater Comeliness is put upon
the more uncomely parts. So there is no schism in the Body.</hi> Thus the <hi>Son</hi> of
God knows, that there are divers <hi>Parts</hi> of things: the <hi>pleasant,</hi> and the <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
Part: the <hi>dark,</hi> and the <hi>light</hi> Part: the <hi>comely,</hi> and the <hi>uncomely,</hi> He
knows also, that the highest <hi>Pleasures</hi> are put upon the most <hi>painful</hi> Part: that
the eternal <hi>ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> rests upon the greatest <hi>darkness,</hi> that the most <hi>uncomely</hi> Things
are cloathed with a divine <hi>Comeliness,</hi> as the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ. So there is no
<hi>Schism</hi> in the <hi>Body</hi> of things to him. He makes, or finds a <hi>Unity</hi> every where.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> sets out <hi>Spirituality at large: 1. Cor. 2. 10, 11. No man knows
the things of a man, save the Spirit of man. No man knows the things of God,
but the Spirit of God. The Spirit searcheth out the deep things of God.</hi> A Saint,
while he is <hi>Carnal,</hi> knows those things only, which lie within the Compass of
a humane Spirit: and divine things only so far as they are shadowed out in
the Spirit of man. But he that is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> knows all things, the things of God,
as they shine out in the Spirit of God. He sees the great Deep of the Godhead
discovered in the Spirit; and all things, as forms floating upon this Deep, as the
waters of this <hi>Abyss.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an eminent difference between a <hi>Carnal,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Christian. A
Carnal Christian sees Heavenly things only, as <hi>Images</hi> stamp'd upon an earthly
<hi>Substance,</hi> represented in an earthly <hi>Principle.</hi> A Spiritual Christian sees earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, as <hi>Images</hi> in a Heavenly <hi>Substance,</hi> and <hi>Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Cor. 2. 13. <hi>Spiritual things are spiritually discerned: Comparing spiritual
things with spiritual.</hi> A <hi>Servile</hi> Saint is in the Fleshly Principle, as in his own
Place. He therefore measures every thing by Fleshly Grounds, and Objects.
He receives each thing, as it is proportion'd to fleshly Appearances, and Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
or prompted by fleshly Apprehensions, and Impressions. A <hi>Son-like</hi> Saint
is in the Spirit, as in his <hi>Element.</hi> He therefore receives things according to the
Suggestions and Infusions of the Spirit: he compares them with the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
and Workings of the Spirit: so he tryes, and judges them.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Third Property</hi> of a Son-like Saint, <hi>Spirituality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Property: <hi>Resignation.</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> of God practiseth this <hi>Resignation</hi> in
<hi>Three Cases:</hi> in
<list>
                  <item>1. Wants.</item>
                  <item>2. Woes.</item>
                  <item>3. Works.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. Resignation <hi>in</hi> Wants. <hi>Matth. 6. 31, 32. Our Saviour takes off his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
from a</hi> Solicitude <hi>concerning Worldly Supplies, by putting them in mind
of the</hi> Relation <hi>between their God, and them:</hi> After all these things the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
take care: Your Heavenly Father knows, that you have need of these things.
<hi>A Son-like Christian, thus disputes it in himself:</hi> The little Child plays freely
before his Father. He takes no thought, what he shall eat at Supper, what he shall
put on to morrow. He leaves all that to his Father to provide. I also will cast
off all care from me upon my Father. He knows what is necessary for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49838:50"/>
of my Being, of the Beauty, Comfort of my Being, every moment. Let
those be troubled with these anxieties, who know no God, or know not that God to
be their Father. It is my Fathers Pleasure to take care of me. It shall be my
only care to please him. If I be careful for any outward thing, my care shall be not
a Solicitude for my self, but Obedience to Him. Yet the care of this also shall be
upon him. For if my Father cloath the Flowers, and my Flesh, will he not much
more cloath my Soul: if He feed the Birds, and my Body, will He not much more
feed my immortal Part with food convenient for it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Resignation:</hi> in <hi>Woes.</hi> When our dear Lord saw a black Sea of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
ready to break upon him, when he heard the Tempest of Divine wrath
now roar about him: in the midst of all this he maintains a Calm upon his
Spirit by a <hi>Resignation</hi> of himself, and all things to his Father: <hi>Father, not my
Will, but Thine be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is nothing so natural, as for a Child to run to the lap of its Parents
in extremities, and to have a Confidence in them. It is as natural for a Child of
God in pains, or griefs to cast itself into the arms of God, and there to breath
forth its sorrows after such a manner as this:</hi> My God, thou art my Father;
thou hast a greater share in me, than I have in my self. I was thine, before I was
mine own. Thou gavest my Being to me, and me to my self. O how great is thy
Dearness towards me thine own! How great is thy Delight in me! Thou art far
nearer to me, than my Self to my Self. I have my Being not in my Self, but in
Thee. I am the Branch, thou art the Sap, the Spirit that runs thorow this Branch,
and quickens it. How much more quick, more deep, more full a Sense hast thou, my
God, of all my Sufferings, than I can have? Thou canst do all things. Thou hast
Strength, I have none. Thou knowest all things. Thou hast Wisdom, I have none.
I then give over my whole Being unto thee. Bear me, as thou dost always, in thine
Arms, and carry me, whither thou wilt. Comprehend me, as One with Thee. Let
me be Thine, be Thou mine; and do, what thou wilt with me. I can fall no lower
than thou fallest with me. When I am at lowest, I shall have thy Power, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
beneath me. As thou risest; thou shalt raise me together with thy self by These.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 1. A <hi>Conviction of the Evil in Sin.</hi> Can I <hi>think,</hi> and not think, that
I have a <hi>Being?</hi> Can I think that I have a <hi>Being,</hi> and not think, that I have it
from <hi>God,</hi> the Fountain of Being? Can I think, that I have my Being from <hi>Him,</hi>
and not think of Him, as my <hi>Father?</hi> Can I think of Him, as of a <hi>Father,</hi> and
oppose <hi>my</hi> Will to <hi>His</hi> Will, and cherish in my Breast an Enmity against him?
This I do, as often as I <hi>Sin.</hi> Is there any thing so <hi>Unnatural,</hi> as <hi>Sin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will press this <hi>Dissuasion</hi> from Sin by a Two-fold <hi>Aggravation</hi> of the Evil
in it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Aggravation.</hi> There is no <hi>Obligati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> like to that of a Child to its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
A Mans Wife is his <hi>Glory, 1 Corin.</hi> 11. 8. But it is the Glory of an
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49838:51"/>
               <hi>Image.</hi> For the Man is the <hi>Head</hi> of the Woman, who is <hi>of</hi> the Man. But the
Father is the First, the Fountain Glory of the Child, its <hi>Head.</hi> For the Child
is <hi>of</hi> the Father.</p>
            <p>God is the <hi>Father</hi> of us all, our Head, our Glory. Do we then refuse to be
guided by him? Do we chuse our <hi>Shame</hi> instead of him? Can we cut our
selves off from him, to unite our selves to vanity, and make our Lusts our <hi>Head?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Man should love his Wife, as his own Body;</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul: Ephes.</hi> 5. 28.
A Man's <hi>Wife,</hi> is as <hi>Himself.</hi> But a Father is <hi>more.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> said: <hi>It is
more Blessed to give, than to receive.</hi> The Child is to honour, to love its Father
above itself as a greater, a more <hi>Blessed</hi> Thing; as that which <hi>gives</hi> itself to
itself.</p>
            <p>Our God is our Father. How unnatural then, is it to prefer our <hi>Self;</hi> nay
the Brutish, the sensual part of our selves, nay the Disorders of that part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Him? The <hi>Apostle</hi> fitly joyned these <hi>Two: Lovers of Pleasure more than
Lovers of God: without natural Affection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Aggravation:</hi> There is no <hi>such</hi> Father, as God is. God is <hi>twice</hi> our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
once <hi>by Nature:</hi> another time <hi>by Grace.</hi> When we Sin against him, we
are his Enemies <hi>four</hi> times over. 1. <hi>We</hi> deface his Image in our Natural man.
2. <hi>We</hi> obscure, and oppose his Heavenly Image. 3. <hi>We</hi> grieve the Spirit of His
Grace. 4. <hi>We</hi> crucifie his Son. Shall we be less than Men to him, because he is
more than a Friend to us? Shall we be worse than Single Enemies to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is better than a Single Father to us?</p>
            <p>O Let us take heed, how we refuse the <hi>Commands</hi> of our God, as a Father;
lest we receive not from him the <hi>Comforts</hi> of a Father in our Confusions, and
Desolations, when we shall most need them; lest we be not received by Him
into the Bosom of a Father, when Death shall take away all other Refuges.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use. 2. Exhortation, Consolation</hi> to the Children of God.
Maintain the <hi>Affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,</hi>
and <hi>Obedience</hi> of Children towards God. Have the <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
of Children in God. Remember this always, that God is your Father. It was

            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:49838:51"/>
1. Consider. God is by Nature more than a Natural Father to thee. <hi>Thou
hast thy Being not only</hi> of, <hi>but</hi> in <hi>Him.</hi> In Him we live, and move, and have
our Being: <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28.</p>
            <p>Can then thy God <hi>forget</hi> thee, or thou <hi>neglect</hi> Him, while thou art in his
Power, his Presence, his Arms, his Bosom? <hi>There</hi> thou art <hi>ever.</hi> Canst thou
lie in his Embraces, grow up out of his Heart, and see him frown at Sin, and
yet Sin, and yet not melt under his Frown? Can he hold thee in his Spirit, as
one Spirit with him, and hear thee groan, and feel thy heart beat, and yet not
melt over thee?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Consider. God is by nature many Fathers to thee:</hi> The <hi>Continuation</hi> of
thy Being is a <hi>continued Creation.</hi> For it flows forth from God fresh every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So many moments as there are in thy life; so many times over is thy God
thy Father. <hi>Gen. 2. 7. God breathed into Man the Breath of life, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Living Soul.</hi> The issuing forth of our Life, and Being from God is
compared to <hi>Breathing.</hi> 'Tis as perpetual.</p>
            <p>Can God cast off all affection, and care for me, in the same moment, in which
He brings me forth? Or can I in that very moment, in which I receive my <hi>Being</hi>
from Him, rob Him of <hi>it,</hi> pollute <hi>it,</hi> turn <hi>it</hi> against Him. This I do every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in which I sin. For but now came I forth from God; <hi>that Appearance,</hi>
which fill'd the last minute, being vanisht, and giving way to <hi>this.</hi> A Mother
forgets her Sorrows so soon, as a Man-child is born into the World. Sure
then God cannot forget his Delights in me, his Loves to me, so soon as He
hath brought me out from Himself into this world: and this he doth freshly
each minute of Time.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Consider.</hi> God is my <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>sweeter,</hi> and <hi>nearer</hi> way, than <hi>by Nature;
by Grace</hi> too. The relation of a Father is the Top of all Sweetness, and Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Nature. But as much as Heaven is above the Earth; Time above Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
God above the Creature: so much is a Father by <hi>Grace</hi> sweeter, and
nearer than a Father by <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a Natural Father plant his Image, and place his Affection, his Care upon
his Son: shall not thy Heavenly Father much more love thee, make thee like
Himself, make all Provisions of life, and joy for thee? It is the rule of God,
<hi>He that provides not for his Family</hi> (in Nature) <hi>hath denyed the Faith, and is
worse than an Infidel.</hi> Can Himself then ever deny <hi>Himself</hi> so far, as to prove
unfaithful, or unnatural towards h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Family of Grace, his own Children that
way? He will certainly take all care of them with all tenderness.</p>
            <p>He that blasphemed, or disobeyed his Parents under the Law, was to die.
What deaths then is he worthy of, who doth not think sweetly, speak sweetly
of, obey chearfully this Father of his Spirit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use. 3. Direction.</hi> If you would attain to the State of <hi>Sons,</hi> and know
God, as your Father: feed well upon this <hi>Four-fold Meditation.</hi>

1. Medita. I lay Eternally in the Fulness of the God-Head, as in the Loyns
of my Father. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 5. Having predestinated us to the Adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by Iesus Christ to Himself, according to the Pleasure of His Will.</p>
            <p>When God had his First and most retired thoughts before the World; then
was I in his thoughts, as a Son of Delights, all lovely, without a spot. When
no other thing yet was, when no Creature was yet made, when God lived alone
in the highest, and purest Joys of his own Nature; then in the midst of all
those Joys was I in the Fulness of the Divine Nature presented to him, as an
Image of Himself springing up in him, to be sent forth into this world, again
to grow up out of this world into that Eternal Image of His Pleasure, and
Will. Thus was I <hi>Predestinated</hi> a Son.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Medita. God hath made me his Son a second time by Purehase.</hi> He hath
given his <hi>Son,</hi> his <hi>Beloved,</hi> his <hi>Only</hi> Son for me, that I might be his Son, 2 <hi>Cor.
5. 21. He was made Sin for us; that we might be made the Righteousness of
God in Him.</hi> God hath given the Body of his Son to reproaches, and pains;
his Soul to Guilt, and Horrours; His Person in both parts to Death; his Name
to Infamy. Thus he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> made Sin for us. And all this that we might be made
the <hi>Righteousness of God,</hi> Images of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ull Beauty, Sons of his highest Glory,
<hi>in Him, as He is,</hi> who is the Substantial Image, the Essential Son.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Seed</hi> is by Nature placed lowest in the Earth, at the bottom of the
Plant, that by the Dissolution of itself, it may bring forth its kind: So was the
<hi>Son</hi> of God laid below, at the bottom of the Creature, in the depth of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
that by his Dissolution he might resolve himself into us, and as by an
Exchange bring forth his <hi>Son-ship</hi> in our Persons.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Medita. God hath made me his Son yet once more by Design.</hi> He hath
joyned me in <hi>Affinity</hi> with his only-begotten Son. Marriage on Earth is a
<hi>Type</hi> of that True Marriage between my Saviour, and my Spirit, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 30.</p>
            <p>He hath joyned me with Him in <hi>Consanguinity,</hi> Heb. 2. 12. <hi>He that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies,</hi>
(which is Jesus) <hi>and they that are Sanctified are both of One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath made me One w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th his Eternal Son <hi>Mystically.</hi> The Mystical Union
is a Mysterious one, hidden, Divine, the highest Union, such as is among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things; not to be <hi>resembled</hi> by any thing among the Creatures, not to be
<hi>comprehended</hi> by any mere Creature. <hi>I in them, and they in me; that all may
be made perfect in One,</hi> John 17. 21. 23.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Medita. God hath made me his Son finally by Generation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3.
<hi>He hath begotten us again to a lively hope by the Resurrection from the dead.</hi> As
the Eternal Spirit lay like a Seed in the dead body of our Lord Jesus, which
putting forth itself, brought forth Eternal Life, and Glory in it: So God the
Father sends forth the same Spirit into our Spirits by which the Divine Life,
and Image of His Glorified Son spring up in us, making us also Sons to Him
in the same manner.</p>

Thus if you would lead <hi>Son-like</hi> lives with God, consider him as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> Kingly State <hi>is described by St.</hi> Paul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. The Kingdom of
God is Righteousness, Peace, and Ioy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>The Kingly <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Royalty</hi> of a Saint hath <hi>Four Properties.</hi>

               <item>1. Righteousness.</item>
               <item>2. Peace.</item>
               <item>3. Ioy.</item>
               <item>4. The Holy Ghost.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Property. Righteousness.</hi> This is the Conformity of a Saint to <hi>God,</hi> as to
his <hi>Rule,</hi> Genes. 17. 1. <hi>Walk thou before me, and be perfect:</hi> Saith God to
<hi>Abraham.</hi> To be <hi>Perfect,</hi> and to be <hi>Righteous</hi> are the same thing. Set thy
God, the Supream Glory, continually in thine Eye, as thy <hi>Pattern,</hi> and thine
<hi>Aim:</hi> So shalt thou be perfectly Righteous.</p>
            <p>I will endeavour further to unfold the Nature of this <hi>Righteousness</hi> by <hi>two
Illustrations, and one Distinction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Illustr.</hi> Then a thing is truly <hi>Right,</hi> when it answereth to its <hi>Idea,</hi> that
is, to its <hi>First Principle,</hi> and <hi>Pattern</hi> in God. God himself in the Fulness of his
Person is the Principle, and Pattern of Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Righteousness</hi> is the Image of God in Man. <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 10. The <hi>New man,</hi>
which is the Righteous man, and the Righteousness of man is said to be <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in Knowledge, after the Image of Him, who hath created Him.</hi> There is a
<hi>Twofold Image</hi> of God, one <hi>Earthly:</hi> the other <hi>Heavenly:</hi> The <hi>Earthly Image</hi>
of God in Man, is the Righteousness of <hi>Nature:</hi> The <hi>Heavenly Image</hi> is the
Righteousness <hi>of</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>in</hi> the Spirit.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Illustr.</hi> Then a thing is truly Right, when it answereth its <hi>End</hi> in God.
God is the <hi>End</hi> of all things: <hi>Prov. 16. 4. God made all things for Himself.</hi>
The End of Man is the <hi>Possession,</hi> and <hi>Fruition</hi> of God as his only <hi>Portion</hi> of
Being, Beauty, Blessedness, <hi>Psal. 16. 5. The Lord is my Portion, saith my Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then is the Righteousness of man, his <hi>Union,</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with
God, to live <hi>in</hi> Him, <hi>by</hi> Him, <hi>with</hi> Him, <hi>to</hi> Him. For this reason is Christ said
to be <hi>made of God Righteousness, and Sanctification to us, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 30. Because
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49838:53"/>
in the Person of Christ it is, that God and Man are made One, one <hi>Love,</hi> one
<hi>Life,</hi> one <hi>Likeness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Distinct.</hi> There are two sorts of Righteousness.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Imputed.</item>
               <item>2. Inherent.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Righteousness imputed.</hi> You may read of this: <hi>Philip. 3. 9. That I may be
found in Him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the Law, but that
which is of God, by Jesus Christ.</hi> There is a Righteousness of the <hi>First,</hi> and of the
<hi>Second</hi> Adam. That of the <hi>First</hi> Adam, is our own, the Righteousness of the
Law. It riseth out of the Earth, it is but a Shadow, at best, the <hi>Gilding</hi> of an
Earthen Ves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>el, a Reflection upon a Brick Wall. That of the <hi>Second</hi> Adam
comes down from Heaven, is of God, is the true <hi>Gold,</hi> the sure, substantial,
everlasting Righteousness.</p>
            <p>As when a Cloud is placed in that part of the Sky, on which the Sun shoots
forth his Beams, the Cloud is over-spread by those Beams, and made Glorious
in their Glories: So are there four Things in this <hi>Imputed Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>The</hi> Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> as the Sky, or Heaven.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The God-head,</hi> as the Sun shining in this Sky.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Cloud,</hi> poor man drawn up from the Earth into the bosom of his
Saviour, by his Union with Him.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The Glory</hi> of the God-Head falling upon him, encompassing, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
his whole Person in Jesus Christ. This is that Righteousness, which is <hi>of
God by Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Cor. 12. 26. St. Paul</hi> teacheth us, that if one member be honoured, all
the members rejoyce together with it. When a Crown is set upon the Head of
a King, it puts a Royalty, and Majesty upon his whole Person. The Head of
<hi>Man is Christ,</hi> the Head of <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God.</hi> The <hi>Glory</hi> of the God-Head in Christ
is the <hi>Crown</hi> upon the Head of the Heavenly man; this puts a Royal Beauty of
Holiness, the Majesty of that Divine Righteousness upon every mystical mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
upon each Soul, how mean soever, that is united to Jesus Christ in one
Spirit thorow believing.</p>
            <p>The Beauty of the God-head shining thorow the Humane Nature of Christ,
thorow his active and passive Obedience, thorow his Wounds, and so falling
upon that Soul, which hath cast herself into the Arms of her Saviour: this is
the <hi>Imputed Righteousness</hi> of man.</p>
            <p>Take this <hi>Caution</hi> concerning this Righteousness. It is said to be <hi>imputed,</hi> not
because it is not truly <hi>Ours,</hi> and <hi>in us:</hi> but because it is not <hi>Primarily</hi> Ours,
but <hi>by our Union</hi> with another Person.</p>
            <p>The Colours in the Rain-bow are said to be <hi>Apparent,</hi> not <hi>Real;</hi> because the
Rain-bow is not their <hi>Spring,</hi> though it be their <hi>Seat;</hi> but they are reflected
from the Sun shining on the watry Cloud. So this <hi>Righteousness</hi> is said to be
<hi>imputed</hi> to us, because it is <hi>First</hi> seated in Jesus Christ, and <hi>then</hi> reflected from
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49838:53"/>
Him on us. Yet it is a true Righteousness, it is <hi>truly, immediately on our Persons,
in our Persons, as Jesus Christ is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore said to be <hi>imputed,</hi> because it is not ours <hi>Primitively,</hi> but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently;</hi>
because <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>ours;</hi> yet not as <hi>Absent</hi> from us, but <hi>Present in us,
possess'd by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Righteousness Inherent,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. last. <hi>We all as in a Glass beholding
the Glory of the Lord, are Translated into the likeness of the same Image from
glory to glory, as by the Lord the Spirit.</hi> The Lord Jesus at once enters into a
<hi>Two-fold Relation</hi> to man: <hi>one</hi> of a <hi>Sun shining</hi> all over him: the other of a
<hi>Root growing</hi> up in him. We see his Glory in our <hi>selves,</hi> as in a <hi>Glass,</hi> we bring
the face of Glory with us. We have <hi>the Glory</hi> in our selves, and are our selves
the <hi>Glass.</hi> There is the <hi>Sun</hi> shining, which beautifies, and <hi>justifies</hi> a St. We
grow up into that Image, by the Lord, the Spirit of that Glory, planting it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in us. There is the <hi>Root</hi> growing, which purifies, and <hi>sanctifies</hi> us.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour, when he discovers Himself, appears at once, <hi>without</hi> us, and
<hi>within</hi> us. <hi>Without</hi> us he riseth upon us, as a <hi>Light of Loveliness.</hi> Es. 60. 1.
<hi>Rise out of the Dust, and shine, for thy Light is come, the glory of the Lord is
risen upon thee. Within us</hi> He riseth, as a <hi>Light of Life,</hi> Galat. 1. 16. <hi>When it
pleased the Father to reveal his Son within me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is our Righteousness, <hi>Imputed,</hi> and <hi>Inherent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Righteousness is the <hi>Crown, Robe, Scepter</hi> of Royalty in the Kingdom
of God.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Crown.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> stiles it, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. Henceforth is laid up
for me a Crown of Righteousness, which God, the righteous Judge shall give me in
that day.</hi> The Righteousness, the Glory of God resting on Man, is that Crown,
which both entitles him <hi>to,</hi> and enstates him <hi>in</hi> the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>As a King ever possesseth his <hi>Crown,</hi> though he wear it only on high days, at
solemn meetings of the people: so a Christian may <hi>have</hi> this <hi>Crown,</hi> though
laid up, while he is on Earth. But he doth not <hi>appear</hi> with it openly, till that
great day, the Resurrection, when the whole world shall meet.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Robe.</hi> The Righteousness of God, and Man is the Imperial Robe,
which both, as Kings, are cloth'd with, <hi>Es. 61. 10 He hath covered me with
a Robe of Righteousness, as a Bridegroom d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cketh himself with Ornaments.</hi> Behold,
a <hi>Royal,</hi> and a <hi>Bridal</hi> Robe! It is <hi>Righteousness</hi> which puts upon the Spirit the
beauty of a <hi>Bridegroom;</hi> the Majesty of a <hi>King.</hi> That Soul, which shines
forth in <hi>Righteousness</hi> makes itself a <hi>King</hi> not by <hi>Right</hi> only, but <hi>Choice</hi> too;
by <hi>Love,</hi> as well as <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psal. 45. 4. 5. <hi>In thy Majesty ride prosperously, because of Truth, Meekness,
and Righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thine Arrows stick in the hearts of thine Enemies, the
people fall under thee.</hi> This was sung of the Lord <hi>Jesus; Righteousness</hi> cloth'd
him with so sweet a Majesty, that he pierc'd the Hearts of His Enemies with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49838:54"/>
of <hi>Love.</hi> Such a <hi>King</hi> is every Spirit, which is Brother to this Jesus.
<hi>Righteousness</hi> sits upon him, and shines from him, as a Garment of Light, Truth,
and Wisdom; it shews, as wrought into a Harmony of Courage, Justice, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance;
it sparkles with Tempers of Goodness, Gentleness, Meekness, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
These things, like <hi>Arrows,</hi> wound the stubbornest Hearts with a <hi>Liking,</hi>
and a <hi>Love;</hi> that a man's bitterest Enemies bow to him.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Scepter. Psal.</hi> 45. 6. It is said to our Saviour: <hi>The Scepter of thy
Kingdom is a Righteous Scepter.</hi> Righteousness is the Scepter of Strength in
the Kingdom of Christ, by which all things are swayed, and governed, <hi>Psal.
16. 7. If a mans ways please the Lord, his Enemies shall be at peace with him.</hi>
Holiness, or Righteousness is such a <hi>Harmony,</hi> such a Musick between God and
Man, as all things hear, and obey.</p>
            <p>They that make use of hellish Charms, make the Picture of a Person in
Wax, and as they work the Wax by the Fire, so they work upon the Person.
Goodness hath a Heavenly Charm in it. For a Righteous man hath in himself
the Heavenly Image of God, which is the <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>radical</hi> Image of all things.
By this <hi>Image,</hi> he hath a power upon all things.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Righteousness</hi> is the <hi>Crown, Robe, Scepter</hi> in the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Use. Learn to hate Sin by the Rule of Contraries.</hi> For, if Righteousness
cloath you with the highest Honour, Worth, Strength of Kings; if it crown
you with the Glory of God, if it carry you up to the Life of God: then what
doth <hi>Sin?</hi> Sin by the Rule of <hi>Contraries</hi> puts upon you the <hi>Baseness, Badness,
Weakness</hi> of Slaves; Sin wraps you up in the <hi>Shape,</hi> sows in you the <hi>Seeds</hi> of
Devils.</p>
            <p>Let us then look on Sin in this <hi>Five-fold View:</hi> As it puts on us. 1. <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
2. Badness. 3. Baseness of Slaves. 4. Shapes of Devils.</hi> 5. As it plants in
us <hi>Seeds of Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sin puts upon us the Weakness of Slaves.</hi> Gen. 49. 3. 4. <hi>Reuben, thou
art my First born, the Beginning of my Strength, Excellency of power.</hi> O Man!
O my Soul! consider what thou wert in thy Beginning. A Divine Flame
shot forth from an Angels Bosom into this lump of Clay, not to abide impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in it, but to feed upon it, as fuel, so to return, and make its way upward,
making all things that resist, its prey, and nourishment, What is it, that hath
thus enfeebled, and cool'd thee, and chang'd thee from <hi>Fire</hi> into <hi>Water? Sin</hi> hath
done this. Now thou lyest spread upon the Earth, swayed by every weak Breath,
or Spirit, that blows upon thee; unable to contain thy self; casting thy self
into the Figure, and Shape of every Object, on which thou touchest. Thy Sword<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
hath thus weakned thee.</p>
            <p>Man was the <hi>Reuben</hi> of God, the <hi>First-born</hi> in the first Creation, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Dignity, and Power; the Head of Strength. He was the Chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Image of the Divine Nature, made to be the Spouse, and Queen of the God-Head
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49838:54"/>
the Onely One of her Mother. The Rest of the Creatures were to be, as
<hi>Concubines</hi> only, particular, inferiour Images of God, The Soul foolishly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes
the Bosom of her God, to throw herself into the Embraces of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines;
so she defileth herself, and them; so she dishonoureth her King, and
Husband in both; so pours forth her self loosely upon the Ground as <hi>spilt
Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Sin puts a Badness into men. <hi>It puts into us a</hi> Three-fold Badness; <hi>of</hi> Folly,
Filth, Fury.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sin fills us with folly.</hi> Sin so far befools thee, O vain Man, as to despise,
deny Blessedness, Beauty, Eternity <hi>there, where</hi> they are, <hi>in God,</hi> the First, the
Fountain, the Substance of all Beings: and to seek them <hi>there, where</hi> they are
not, in Fleshly, shadowy, fleeting Trifles.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>Folly,</hi> the Head-Spring of all Sin, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains of,
<hi>Rom. 1. 21. They became vain in their Imaginations, their foolish Heart being
darkned.</hi> This was the <hi>Folly,</hi> The Eternal Substance, and Fulness was darkned
and disappeared in their Spirits, which brought forth instead thereof empty
Images. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> explains it at the 23. <hi>v. Changing the glory of the Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
God into an Image made like to Corruptible Man, and Birds</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What degree of <hi>Folly</hi> is this, to refuse to acknowledge, or own the <hi>true
God,</hi> who is Eternal Life: and to make each painted, perishing <hi>Vanity</hi> a <hi>God</hi> to
us, while we make it the <hi>Object,</hi> and <hi>Spring</hi> of our Hopes, and Happiness?</p>
            <p>But thus it is most just, that they to whom the true God, is but as an Idol,
an empty name; to them each Idol, each empty Appearance should be their
God. This is the <hi>First Badness</hi> in Sin, <hi>Folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Sin fills a Man with Filth.</hi> Carnality, and Corruption signify both the
same thing in Scripture. To be Spiritual is to be Holy; to be Fleshly, Sinful,
<hi>To be Carnally minded,</hi> (that is, to be Fleshly-minded) <hi>is Death: but to be
Spiritually minded is Life, and Peace:</hi> Rom. 8. 6.</p>
            <p>Is there any thing more <hi>foul</hi> than this; for a Soul, which was made, as a
<hi>Spirit,</hi> for Spiritual Joys, and Glories; so to mingle itself with <hi>Flesh,</hi> as to see,
receive, rellish nothing but by Senses of Flesh; so to drown itself in Flesh, as
to be uncapable of conversing with, taking conte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t in any, but Fleshly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects?
This is the State of a Sinful Soul: Thus is she over-spread with <hi>Flesh,</hi>
as one great <hi>Spot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Interpreters of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> teach us, that the <hi>Young Man</hi> there, is the
<hi>Soul,</hi> which is naturally Immortal, ever young, ever flourishing: the <hi>Matron,</hi>
the chast Spouse, that woes this Young Man, <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> the Heavenly
Image of the Divine Nature: The <hi>Strumpet</hi> this <hi>Worldly Image</hi> of things. O
say now, when thou Sinnest; <hi>Alass! How do I dishonour, and defile my self? I,
who should, who might live chastly, constantly, sweetly with the Eternal Image of
Glory, my God, my Spouse, mine own: I pour forth my self into the lap of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49838:55"/>
of Unconstant, Whorish, Flattering, Fading Beauties in Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Filth! O Shame! That Spirit, that should tread upon the Stars, ride upon
the Angels, rejoyce with God everlastingly; that Soul labours and sweats in
Dust, and Death, as a Slave; rowls in the Mire of Flesh, like a Beast; rakes in
the unsavory sinks of all various Lusts, as an unclean Spirit.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Sin fills a man with Fury. Solomon</hi> in his <hi>Proverbs</hi> tells us of One, <hi>that
throws about Fire-brands and Swords, and saith, Am I not in jest?</hi> Prov. 26.
18. 19. This is <hi>Solomon's Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l,</hi> which is a <hi>Sinner.</hi> Can it be, that any should
make Ruines, and Reproaches their <hi>Delight,</hi> nay their <hi>Devotion</hi> too? <hi>Jonah</hi>
said once. <hi>He did well to be angry even unto Death.</hi> Can it be, that any should
cherish a Rage to the Death, Destruction of Men, Kingdoms, and Souls; and
then think such a <hi>Rage, Religion;</hi> such a <hi>Fury, Zeal;</hi> and that these things they
ought to do? Can it be that any should draw Tears, and blood from others,
from Millions, from such as do them no harm; and then say, <hi>With such Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
God is well pleased; that God,</hi> who is <hi>Love?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O take heed of <hi>Sin,</hi> it blows up in a mans Breast, the Fire of Hell; it strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
corrupts <hi>Nature</hi> itself consumes all <hi>good Nature</hi> in Man. There is no <hi>Notion</hi>
so common, no <hi>Principle</hi> so plain in the minds of men, which it will not darken,
and deprave. It will make you believe that Hellish Passions, are Heavenly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and that there is Fury, and Fire in the Bosom of Sweetness itself, of God.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Second Evil</hi> in Sin, <hi>Filth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Sin puts upon a man the Baseness of a Slave.</hi> Prov. 28. 1. <hi>The wicked
fleeth, when none pursues.</hi> Sin makes a man the veriest Coward in the World,
the object of the greatest Pity and Scorn. When thou hast committed a sin,
how art thou asham'd to see the light, to look up in the Eyes of God or any
man, to behold thine own Face in a Glass? How dost thou start at every Motion,
tremble at thine own Shadow, fly from the Reflection of thy self in the
thoughts of another? How dost thou wish to be transported into some Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
where thou might'st be a Stranger to all things, and especially to thy self?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen. 4. 14. Cain</hi> complains: <hi>I am driven from thy Face, and from the
Face of the Earth; a Fugitive and a vagabond shall I be in the Earth.</hi> Behold
the weight of Shame, with which Sin oppresseth a Guilty Soul. Who would
buy all the pleasures, and profits of Sin at such a rate, as this? To be driven
by Shame from the Face of God, and every Creature? To be hunted by the
wretched Sense of Guilt, as a Deer with the Arrow sticking in his side? To
run restless thorow all Companies, and Conditions, as a Fugitive, and Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond
in them all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 7. It is said of our first Parents, when they had eaten the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Fruit, <hi>their, eyes were opened, and they saw, that they were naked,</hi> and now
they were ashamed. Do you ask, <hi>what is Sin?</hi> There is an inseparable Peace,
and Pleasure goes along with every good deed; There is an unavoidable sting
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49838:55"/>
of Shame, and Horrour in the tail of every evil Act. He that doth evil, hath
his Eyes immediately opened by that, which he feels in himself; and now he
knows what he hath done.</p>
            <p>What is that, which when you have done it, takes away your sweet Peace,
and Rest from you? which makes you wish for a thick Darkness to fall upon
you, that may hide you from every eye? This is <hi>Sin,</hi> hate it, and fly from it.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Third Evil</hi> in Sin.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Sin wraps up a man in the Shape of a Devil. Man being in Honour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
not, but becomes like the Beast, that perisheth.</hi> What doth the <hi>Body</hi> of a
<hi>Man</hi> now differ from that of a <hi>Beast</hi> more than the Body of one Beast differs
from that of another? Nay the <hi>Bodies</hi> of many Brute Creatures excel it in
Beauty, Strength, Vertue, Sense.</p>
            <p>What hath thus chang'd Man, and put upon his <hi>Body</hi> the form of a Beast?
<hi>Sin</hi> hath done it. But if we could see the <hi>Soul</hi> of man, as plainly, as we see
his <hi>Body;</hi> we should see that far more like to <hi>Devils,</hi> than this is to <hi>Beasts.</hi> The
Evil Powers, and Spirits might well say of Man, when he had sinn'd; <hi>He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as one of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What reason hath man to abhor this Poysonous, this Potent Evil, which
transforms him into this monstrous Shape, that he appears, as a <hi>Beast</hi> among
the Beasts, in his Body; as a <hi>Devil</hi> among the Devils, in his Soul?</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Sin plants the Seeds of Devils in Man. Daniel</hi> teacheth us in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy,
that the Messiah should come <hi>to take away Sin, and Iniquity. Dan.</hi> 9. 24.
We read in the Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. That there should be Enmity between the
Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent. The Seed of the Woman
is the Messias: Then the Seed of the Serpent must be Sin. Each <hi>Sin</hi> is the
<hi>Seed</hi> of a <hi>Devil</hi> in us, which as it grows up, becomes a perfect Devil. A Lying
Spirit entred into Ahab's Prophets, and possest them when they became Lyars.</p>
            <p>Happy were we, if as often, as we feel motions to Lust, Covetousness, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood,
Ambition in us; we would then say: Now a Lustful, Covetous, False
Ambitious <hi>Devil</hi> enters into me; if I yield to him, he will carry me away into
the Waters, and Fires, of Confusion, and Torment, he will be still growing
into me, till I become <hi>one Devil</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Property: Peace.</hi> This is the <hi>Second Property</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi>
that is, in the <hi>Royal State</hi> of a Saint on Earth.</p>
            <p>The name of <hi>Peace</hi> in the three Learned Languages signifieth <hi>Three things:</hi>

or league with all things: <hi>Perfection</hi> of excellency, and joy to give Rest.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Three-fold Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Natural:</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Elements in the great World, and the little
World of Man's Body.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Civil:</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> of men among themselves in their outward Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</p>

               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49838:56"/>
3. <hi>Religious:</hi> this is the <hi>Peace</hi> of the Soul in relation to God. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Peace is Two-fold.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Rational:</hi> that which is built upon the Principle of <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>Spiritual:</hi> that which is sprung from a <hi>Divine</hi> Light. This is the union
of mans Spirit with the Spirit of God, which is the <hi>Band of peace.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>It is a <hi>Spiritual Peace,</hi> which I now speak of: This hath <hi>Two Parts.</hi>

               <item>1. Part: <hi>Silence.</hi>

            </list>
            <p>He, (that is, God) makes me to lye down in green pastures, and leads me by
still waters.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Part: Silence. Psal.</hi> 23. 2. In this <hi>Psalm</hi> God is brought in, as a
<hi>Shepherd;</hi> the Soul as a <hi>Sheep.</hi> In this <hi>verse Three Things</hi> are put together.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>Prosperity</hi> of the Soul.</item>
               <item>2. The <hi>Repose</hi> of the Soul.</item>
               <item>3. The <hi>Stilness</hi> of all things about the Soul.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. The <hi>Prosperity</hi> of the Soul is express'd by <hi>green pastures.</hi> The Lord
Jesus makes the Soul to feed on the green Pastures of the Fresh, and Flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
discoveries of his Person, and Excellencies. That this is the Souls <hi>Pasture</hi>
appears by that place of <hi>Scripture,</hi> John 6. 57. <hi>As the living Father hath
sent me; and I live by the Father: So he that eateth me, shall live by me.</hi> As the
Father is the <hi>Pasture-ground</hi> of the Son, on which he feeds, and out of which
he is taken into this World, to be made a Sacrifice: So the <hi>Pasture-ground</hi> of
the Soul is <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Repose</hi> of the Soul is signified: <hi>He makes me to lye down</hi> in green
pastures. Jesus Christ, as a <hi>Shepherd</hi> makes the Soul to lay herself down to
rest with security in the midst of his appearances springing up round about her.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Stilness</hi> and <hi>Silence</hi> of all things about the Soul is set down: <hi>He
leads me by still Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Waters <hi>are often used by the</hi> Scriptures <hi>to represent the nature of</hi> Spirits, <hi>John</hi>
7. 38. 39. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall
flow Rivers of living waters. This he spake of the Holy Ghost, which they, that
beleive in him, should receive.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> maketh two <hi>resemblances</hi> between <hi>Waters,</hi> and <hi>Spirits.</hi> 1. As
the Springs of <hi>water</hi> nourish the Earth, and make it fruitful: So every fleshly
thing hath a <hi>Spirit,</hi> which sends forth its streams upon it, to refresh it. <hi>Psal. 46. 4. There is a River, that makes glad the City of our God.</hi> The Holy Spirit is
the <hi>River,</hi> that maintains, and renews the life, and <hi>appearances</hi> of God in the
Flesh, which make the <hi>City</hi> of God on Earth. 2. The <hi>Second Resemblance</hi> is
this, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. We read of the <hi>Earth standing in the Water, and out of the
Water.</hi> In like manner we learn, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3. that <hi>the things which are seen,
were not made of things, that do appear.</hi> Some read it thus: <hi>the things which
are seen, were made of things that do not appear</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Earth</hi> stands in the <hi>Water,</hi> and out of the Water: So every <hi>Visible
Thing</hi> stands in a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and stands up out of a Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:49838:56"/>
The Tumultuous workings, and agitations of these <hi>Spirits</hi> in us are the
cause of all unquietness in our Spirits. But when Jesus Christ leads forth our
Souls into the Fields of his Excellencies, and gives us of his Love: He calms all;
so that every <hi>Spirit</hi> by which we pass along, as by a <hi>River</hi> side, is still, and silent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Peace</hi> of the Soul dependeth upon the <hi>Silencing</hi> of a <hi>Three-fold Spirit</hi>
in her.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Spirit of Wrath from God.</item>
               <item>2. The Spirit of the Devil.</item>
               <item>3. Her own Spirit.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. The Spirit of Wrath from God <hi>must be silenc'd in us that we may have
peace,</hi> Iere. 25. 30. <hi>You may read of this</hi> Spirit of Wrath. The Lord shall
roar from above, and send forth his voice from his holy habitation: He shall roar
upon his habitation, and cry aloud, as they that press the Grapes, against all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Earth.</p>
            <p>The terrours, and troubles of the Soul do not always come <hi>from,</hi> or <hi>by</hi> some
<hi>Secundary cause;</hi> but sometimes they come <hi>immediately from</hi> God Himself. God
comes forth into the Soul, like a <hi>Lyon:</hi> He sends forth his voice quite thorow
the Soul, as the roaring of an enraged Lyon: He presseth, and squeezeth the
Souls with his own weight, with a cry of Wrath; as <hi>Grapes</hi> are troden. This
may be the case of any Soul, even the most <hi>Holy Habitation</hi> of the Lord, while
she is the Inhabitant of an <hi>Earthly</hi> body.</p>
            <p>What shall the Soul now do, that is in this case? To what Creature shall
she call to help her against the mighty God? What course will you take to
find rest to this Soul? No creature, no course can give any rest, till it please
God to change Himself from a roaring <hi>Lyon,</hi> to a still, and quiet <hi>Lamb</hi> in the
Soul. He can make this change in a moment, and by this change make the Soul,
though she were but just before, as a dreadful <hi>Forest</hi> to herself, now to become
a safe, and silent <hi>Fold,</hi> that she may lye down quietly, and take her rest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>See, what</hi> Iob <hi>complains of, and what he prays for,</hi> Iob 10. 16. Thou
huntest me, as a fierce Lyon: Thou shewest thy self marvellous upon me: <hi>v.</hi> 17.
Thou renewest thy witnesses against me: Changes, and War are upon me. <hi>v.</hi> 20.
Cease, and let me alone, that I may take a little comfort.</p>
            <p>Oft-times God pursues a Soul fiercely, and swiftly, as if she were some great,
and mighty creature. He hunts her from thought to thought, from place to
place, from creature to creature; not suffering her to take her breath. <hi>He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neweth
his Witnesses against her;</hi> He maketh her guilt, her miseries, her fears,
his wrath, eternal horrours to appear continually before her in fresh, and new
Shapes, <hi>as witnesses</hi> against her. So he makes himself <hi>marvellous</hi> upon her in
those various, and heart-shaking <hi>Forms</hi> of darkness, with which he clothes
himself in the midst of her. He brings <hi>Changes:</hi> He suffers her not to abide
in any temper or state, but tos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth and changeth the whole appearance of
things to her; till she be quite lost in confusion, and amazement.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49838:57"/>
And poor Soul, whither shall she go? What shall she do, that she may
have ease, that she may have some comfort, though never so little? She can
have no ease, no comfort at all, till Gods time be come, till his will be, to cease,
and take his plague away from her, and silence the Spirit of his wrath within
her. All that the Soul can do in the mean time is; and that by his Strength
alone, to wait, and cry: <hi>Cease thou from me, O God.</hi> There is a Time to break
in pieces: and a Time to bind up, that which is broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But some one may say: How can God trouble or disquiet a Soul, <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
and by Himself, Fury is not in Him,</hi> Es. 24. 4. There is no Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Evil or Torment in the Person of God. There is no Spirit of anguish,
or vexation in the <hi>Divine nature.</hi> We read of him, <hi>Psal. 16. 11. In thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is fulness of joy.</hi> When God brings forth his own presence into the Soul;
he brings along with it all peace, and pleasantness, a <hi>Fulness of Joy.</hi>

               <hi>Ans.</hi> You must distinguish upon the <hi>Appearances,</hi> and the <hi>Person</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Distinct.</hi> You must distinguish upon the <hi>Appearances</hi> of God. God puts forth
<hi>Himself immediately two ways,</hi> either in <hi>his own Appearance,</hi> or in <hi>a strange
Appearance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> God puts forth <hi>Himself immediately,</hi> sometimes in <hi>his own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance:</hi>
and then he ever makes peace. This Apppearance of God calms,
qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ets, and sweetens all in the Soul, <hi>Es. 4. 5. Upon all the Glory shall be a
Defence.</hi> The Presence of God in his proper Glory, the naked Face of God
looking froth in the Soul is a <hi>Defence</hi> from trouble, and terrour. This is the <hi>Holy
Moun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> on which nothing can hurt, or spoil. This Discovery of God <hi>is a Light,</hi>
which hath no darkness in it, no trembling, or fear,</p>
            <p>Therefore, when the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> had said, <hi>Psal. 16. 11. In thy presence is
the fulness of Joy:</hi> He adds for explication: <hi>At thy right hand are pleasures for
evermore.</hi> The presence of God at the <hi>right hand</hi> of his own proper Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Glory; which is his Strength: this is ever accompanied in the Soul,
with a <hi>Fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ness of Joy, and everlasting pleasures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> God can put forth <hi>Himself immediately</hi> in a <hi>strange Appearance,</hi>
without the interposal of any <hi>Created Substance</hi> between God, and that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
between that appearance, and the Soul, <hi>Joh. 20. 15. Jesus Christ</hi>
appeared to <hi>Mary,</hi> and conversed immediately with her in the <hi>likeness</hi> of a
Gard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ner, which made her weep for fear, that she had lost her Saviour, who was

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> under this strange Shape; which drew forth her tears.</p>
            <p>So God can set his own Person, and presence in our Souls in the Shape of a
<hi>Stranger,</hi> of an <hi>Enemy,</hi> of a devouring <hi>Tempest,</hi> of a burning <hi>Fire, Psal.</hi> 18.
11. It is written of God: <hi>He maketh Darkness his Secret place: and thick
Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uds of the Sky his pavilion.</hi> God can make <hi>Darkness</hi> in thy Soul <hi>His Secret
place,</hi> out of which he shoots his invenomed arrows into thy heart. He can
make <hi>thick Clouds</hi> upon thy Soul, his <hi>Pavilion,</hi> from whence he will make
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49838:57"/>
war upon thee. Thus we must distinguish upon the <hi>Appearances</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Distinct.</hi> Secondly, we must distinguish upon the <hi>Person</hi> of God, as <hi>He
is in Himself;</hi> and as <hi>He is in Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> God as <hi>He is in Himself is One,</hi> One rest, and blessedness in every
State? Thus God is <hi>All in All,</hi> all that sweetness, peace, joy in <hi>every</hi> Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
which he is in <hi>any</hi> Appearance.</p>
            <p>It is said in <hi>Job</hi> of the Earth, as it was in its first State: <hi>No stranger passed
thorow it.</hi> So it is true of the God-Head in its first State, in its simplicity; that
there is no <hi>Strange Appearance</hi> there. This Throne of God wherever it is set
up, is a <hi>Circle;</hi> and every hand is the <hi>Right Hand</hi> there, every <hi>Shape,</hi> in which
God puts forth Himself is <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Secondly, <hi>God, as He is</hi> in Iesus Christ, <hi>hath his</hi> Right, <hi>and his</hi> Left Hand;
<hi>his</hi> Sweet, <hi>and</hi> Strange <hi>Appearances;</hi> Light, <hi>and</hi> Darkness; Love, <hi>and</hi> Wrath:
Revel. 6. 16. <hi>They</hi> cry to the Rocks, and the Mountains to fall upon them, to
hide them from the wrath of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> witnesseth: <hi>John. 5. 22. The Father judgeth no man, but hath
committed all judgment to the Son.</hi> This distinguishing, and dividing Judgment,
by which God puts forth Himself in <hi>Love</hi> upon some, in <hi>Wrath</hi> upon others,
is not exercised by the <hi>Father,</hi> that is, by God, as He is <hi>in Himself;</hi> but by the
<hi>Son,</hi> that is, by God, as He is <hi>in Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> the shining forth of the God-Head from the
right hand of the Lord Jesus, in its own proper Glory, calming, and clearing
up all in the Soul; scattering, like Clouds, those strange Appearances of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Terrour, into which God had before put himself.</p>
            <p>This is Christ <hi>shewing us the Father,</hi> discovering God in his <hi>First Light,</hi> as
He is the Fountain of Love, where there is neither Fear, nor Torment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 1. For <hi>Tryal.</hi> By this we may try our selves, whether we be <hi>in the
Kingdom of God,</hi> or no. <hi>The Kingdom of God is Peace.</hi> If you be truly in
<hi>Peace,</hi> you are of a truth in the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>I will enlarge this <hi>Tryal</hi> by <hi>Three Instances,</hi> which are the <hi>Glory,</hi> the <hi>Grace,</hi>
the <hi>Blessing</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Glory: First</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, and the <hi>Peace</hi> of God ever go together,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 14. In the Angels Song these two are united: <hi>Glory to God on high,
Peace on Earth. Jesus Christ,</hi> when he came down from Heaven, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate:
<hi>Angels</hi> in their Praises, and Prayers at the Incarnation, joyn these
two, Spiritual <hi>Glory,</hi> and Spiritual <hi>Peace,</hi> as undivided in their Life, and Death,
in their <hi>absence,</hi> and <hi>presence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Soul, that is without Peace, is indeed <hi>without</hi> in that Darkness, which
<hi>is without;</hi> whither nothing of the Glory of God comes, whence no Glory is
given to God. If thou canst live without <hi>Peace;</hi> thou livest in a true <hi>Hell,</hi>
where there is nothing of the Light of the Glory of God; nor any desire of
it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:49838:58"/>
If thou hadst any taste or glympse of the <hi>Glory</hi> of God in thy Soul; thou
wouldst feel a sweet <hi>peace</hi> within thee, with thy God, with thy self, and with
all things.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Glory</hi> of God <hi>is a Healing, a Uniting,</hi> a Perfecting thing: it makes all
perfect in One, <hi>Mal. 4. 2. A Sun of Righteousness shall arise with healing in
his Wings.</hi> The Sun-shine of <hi>Glory</hi> falling from the Face of God upon the Soul
in any degree, sweetly and soundly closeth up wounds, maketh up breaches, and
divisions in the Spirit. The <hi>Wings</hi> of the Sun are his Beams. Each touch of any
one Beam of the <hi>Glory</hi> of God upon the Soul, carries a healing, lenifying, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing
vertue.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Grace.</hi> Secondly the <hi>Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> of God ever go together. St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> when he prays for the Saints at the beginning of all his <hi>Epistles,</hi> joyns
<hi>these Two: Grace, and peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
So much of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, as goes forth into the Soul; so much of <hi>Peace</hi>
goes along with it. Where there is no <hi>Peace,</hi> there is no <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There <hi>is</hi> a <hi>Two-fold Grace</hi> of God, the <hi>Love</hi> of God towards the Soul; the
<hi>Loveliness,</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of God in the Soul.</p>
            <p>1. Where there is nothing of <hi>Peace,</hi> there is nothing of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God,
that is, of the <hi>Love</hi> of God, yet appearing to that Soul. Where the <hi>Love</hi> of
God is poured forth, it is an overflowing <hi>Sweetness, 1 Corin. 13. 5. Charity
thinketh no ill.</hi> This <hi>Charity,</hi> which is said in the same Chapter to be <hi>perfect,</hi> to
remain <hi>for ever,</hi> can be no other, than the <hi>Love of God</hi> let down from Heaven
into the Soul, and revealed there, gathering the Soul up into itself, to dwell in
this <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Soul, that dwells in this <hi>Love, thinks no evil</hi> of God, of itself, of any
thing: but is <hi>at peace</hi> with all, hath <hi>sweet thoughts</hi> of all. For the Love of
God is its <hi>Eye,</hi> by which it sees, and its <hi>Heart</hi> by which it thinks. It sees <hi>God,
itself,</hi> and <hi>all things</hi> by the <hi>Light</hi> of this <hi>Love:</hi> it thinks of all things by the
<hi>Strength</hi> of this <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Where there is nothing of <hi>Peace,</hi> there is nothing of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God,
that is of the <hi>loveliness</hi> of God, of the Beauty of Holiness in that Soul. So
much of <hi>Peace,</hi> so much of <hi>Holiness,</hi> and Spirituality: So much of Distraction,
and Disquiet, so much of Corruption, and Carnality.</p>
            <p>Where things begin to <hi>descend,</hi> there begins <hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Division.</hi> As things
descend, and go lower, so these things increase. Where things begin to <hi>ascend,</hi>
there begins <hi>Spirit, Spirituality,</hi> Unity, and Peace. The more we ascend, and
go upward, the more we increase in these.</p>
            <p>3. Blessing. <hi>Thirdly, the</hi> Blessing, <hi>and the</hi> Peace <hi>of God ever go together,</hi>
Prov. 15. 17. Better is a Dinner of Herbs with Love, than a stalled <hi>Ox</hi>
with hatred. Love <hi>is the</hi> Womb <hi>of</hi> Peace, <hi>and</hi> Hatred <hi>is the</hi> Mother <hi>of</hi> Unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<hi>as appears by that place,</hi> Prov. 10. 12. Hatred stirreth up strife: but
Love covereth a multitude of Sins.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:49838:58"/>
Didst thou live at the highest rate of all content in thine outward man, and
hadst no <hi>peace</hi> in thy Soul; thou couldst have nothing <hi>blest</hi> to thee. All thy
delicacies would have a <hi>bitterness</hi> on thy palate, and a venom in thy bowels,
that will never suffer thee to have a true joy in any thing, which thou enjoyest.</p>
            <p>Hadst thou but a <hi>Dinner of Herbs</hi> the lowest fare, such as the Cattel may
have together with thee; and hadst Spiritual <hi>peace</hi> with it: these Herbs would
have such a <hi>blessing</hi> in them, that they would be, as the food of <hi>Paradise</hi> was
to man, when he had Herbs, and all Green things given him for meat.</p>
            <p>If thine inward man had a <hi>stalled</hi> Ox, those <hi>Oxen,</hi> which <hi>Wisdom</hi> slays,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 2. prepared for it; the <hi>strongest notions,</hi> the highest <hi>Mysteries</hi> set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thine understanding: if thou hadst not the <hi>peace</hi> of God in these, these
could be no <hi>Blessing;</hi> thy Soul with them would not thrive, it would be but
as <hi>Pharoah's lean Kine,</hi> that devoured the <hi>fat</hi> ones, and were still, as lean: All
thy <hi>notions,</hi> and <hi>Mysteries</hi> would be but a tinkling <hi>noise,</hi> an empty <hi>sound</hi> vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
without any profit, or lasting pleasure.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Herbs,</hi> the <hi>lowest administrations,</hi> the darkest discoveries of Christ toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>peace,</hi> is a <hi>Feast of fat things,</hi> and <hi>Wine upon the Lees,</hi> which though
it have not so <hi>clear manifestations,</hi> yet may have, as <hi>sweet,</hi> and <hi>strong consolations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But now some good Soul may cry out: Alass! this shuts me quite out
of the Kingdom of God: by this I have nothing of the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, or of
His <hi>Grace</hi> in me, or of his <hi>Blessing</hi> going along with me, for I have no <hi>peace.</hi>
My Tears are my Drink, Day, and Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Thou art no <hi>good Judge</hi> in this cause. For thou mayst be deceived
two ways, and this is the <hi>Two-fold Answer,</hi> which thou art to make to thine
own Soul.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> of God may both be grown up to a
good degree in thee, though thou discern them not.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> of God may be <hi>sown,</hi> though they be not
<hi>grown</hi> up in thy Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans. 1. First,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> of God may be grown up to a
good degree in thy Soul, though thou discern them not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. 27. The <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> is compared to <hi>Corn,</hi> which while a man
<hi>Sleeps</hi> and <hi>Rises, Night and Day, Spring and Grows up, he knows not how.</hi> The
<hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of the Lord Jesus may be springing, and well sprung up in
thy Spirit, while thou <hi>sleepest</hi> in the Darkness of some Temptation, and hast
no sense at all of this Spring, and Growth, though it be continual, and flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
within thee. This is hard to believe, or understand, <hi>how</hi> it should be. Yet
thus the Lord tells thee, that his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which is <hi>Peace</hi> puts forth itself in
the Ground of thine Heart, and prospers, and grows a <hi>tall plant</hi> there, while
thou hast <hi>no sense</hi> of it, but <hi>sleepest;</hi> though <hi>thou knowest not how.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> distinguisheth this growth of the Kingdom of God in the Soul
into a <hi>Three-f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the blade; then the Ear; after that the full Corn in the Ear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> is the Lord Jesus in his <hi>Earthly,</hi> or <hi>Fleshly</hi> Image; as he is the
<hi>Ground</hi> out of which we all Spring forth in our <hi>First State,</hi> or <hi>Image.</hi> He in
us <hi>of Himself</hi> sends forth and shoots up his Kingdom <hi>naturally</hi> in our <hi>Souls,</hi> as
<hi>Trees</hi> set or planted <hi>in Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The full <hi>Corn in the Ear;</hi> the <hi>Ear;</hi> the <hi>Blade</hi> signify a <hi>Three-fold Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
State</hi> of a Saint on Earth, in the Body.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> is the <hi>Royal,</hi> or <hi>Kingly State,</hi> of which I am now speaking. The
other <hi>Two</hi> are distinct <hi>degrees</hi> of the State of <hi>Sonship,</hi> or <hi>Child hood,</hi> as it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the State of a <hi>Servant,</hi> which hath the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> only <hi>Sown,</hi>
not yet <hi>grown</hi> up in him.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First</hi> is the <hi>full Corn in the Ear.</hi> This is the <hi>Royal State,</hi> in which the
<hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Gospel are displaid, the <hi>Spiritual Person</hi> of the Lord Jesus in
all his <hi>Proportions</hi> is form'd, and puts forth himself in the Soul with a <hi>fulness,</hi> a
fulness of Spiritual <hi>Light, Peace, Strength,</hi> and joy. Yet all this <hi>clearness,</hi> and
<hi>fulness</hi> is under a <hi>vail,</hi> in the <hi>Husk</hi> still of <hi>Flesh.</hi> It is the full Corn <hi>in the Ear,</hi>
not <hi>thresh't</hi> out by Death, and <hi>winnow'd</hi> by a Resurrection; but still standing
in <hi>this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou mayst have this <hi>State</hi> in thee, and yet not see the <hi>Corn</hi> for the <hi>Husk:</hi>
but mistake, and mis-interpret Christ in thee; because thou seest the <hi>Flesh</hi> still;
and feelest thy self shaken with Winds, and beaten with Storms, as being still
in the <hi>open Field</hi> of this world.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Second State</hi> is the <hi>Ear.</hi> Thou mayst have the <hi>Blessing, Grace,</hi> and
<hi>Glory</hi> of the Lord Jesus running up in thy Spirit to a good height, with great
store of <hi>Sap:</hi> thou mayst be now near to a kind of perfection in <hi>Spirituality.</hi>
Yet all this may be in a form of <hi>Darkness, Emptiness,</hi> and <hi>Confusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take heed of judging the <hi>State,</hi> in which thou art; the <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> in
thee, by the <hi>appearance.</hi> For so doing thou mayst call <hi>Light, Darkness;</hi> because
it <hi>shines in the Dark.</hi> Be not like a foolish Husbandman, that should look upon
his Corn in the Field, when it were new <hi>Eared,</hi> and should complain, that all
his hopes were cast away; that he had <hi>Straw</hi> or <hi>Grass,</hi> instead of <hi>Wheat;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he yet sees not the <hi>Corn</hi> formed in the <hi>Ear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Third State</hi> is the <hi>Blade.</hi> Do not deny the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> with the
<hi>Peace</hi> thereof to be come up in thee; because thou canst not <hi>discern</hi> it. It may
be truly come up in thee; but perhaps 'tis yet in the <hi>Blade,</hi> in tender, weak,
low appearances; hardly shewing itself above the <hi>Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ds</hi> of the plowed Earth,
the trouble of thy broken heart; hardly distinguish't from <hi>weeds,</hi> the workings
of the Flesh in thee.</p>
            <p>Now take this <hi>Three-fold Caution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Caut. First,</hi> take heed of over-seeing or undervaluing the <hi>full Corn,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it still in the <hi>Ear</hi> or <hi>Husk.</hi> Do not cast away from your self the Praise
of Christ, and Joy of Spirit, which belong to a <hi>strong,</hi> and <hi>reigning</hi> Christian
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49838:59"/>
because you have <hi>Strong,</hi> and <hi>raging</hi> Temptations, as being still in the <hi>Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Caut. Secondly:</hi> Refuse not to acknowledge Jesus Christ in the <hi>Ear;</hi>
because you have not yet the <hi>full Corn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Caut.</hi> Thirdly: Deny not Jesus Christ to have appeared in you; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is as yet only in the <hi>Blade</hi> or tender Herb.</p>
            <p>Thus I have discours'd upon the <hi>First Answer</hi> to a Doubting Soul.</p>
            <p>Ans. 2. The Second Answer <hi>is this:</hi> The Kingdom, and Peace of God may be
sown, though they be not grown up in thy Soul. <hi>You must distinguish between
the</hi> Devil's Madmen, <hi>and</hi> God's Mourners.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Devil's Madmen</hi> are such, as throw abroad Swords, and Fire-brands
in the midst of their own Spirits, and say; <hi>Are we not in Jest?</hi> They toss
Vanity up and down in their Souls, and Lives; they brandish, and blaze their
Pride, Passion, and Lusts. These are their <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Kingdom;</hi> their <hi>Pleasures,</hi>
and <hi>Glories.</hi> But they have no sense of the <hi>Peace of God,</hi> and his Kingdom.
They understand not how they drive these far from their Souls, and kindle the
Fire of Hell-torments in their Hearts, while they roul themselves in carnal se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
and Fleshly Pleasures. Against these <hi>this use</hi> is directed, and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of God are discovered.</p>
            <p>2. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> there are <hi>God's Mourners,</hi> holy Souls, which can take no
Joy in any Worldly thing, because they have no sense of the Peace of God in
their Spirits. These good Hearts are cloth'd with a Garment of Heaviness;
but that Garment is as a vail only upon the Beauty of Jesus Christ, which is of
a Truth in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> though as yet it be hid from their <hi>Eyes.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Eyes are full of Tears, they go on weeping; but they carry their
<hi>precious Seed</hi> with them in the Secret of their Souls.</p>

               <hi>These are</hi> Gods Mourners, <hi>and these are to apply to themselves, that sweet
Promise,</hi> Es. 57. 18. I have seen his ways, I will heal him; I will lead him
also, and I will restore Peace to him, and to his Mourners, <hi>the verse before was:</hi>
For the iniquities of his Covetousness I was Wroth with him, and smote him: I
hid me, and was Wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his Heart.</p>
            <p>How absolute, how sweet, how full is this Promise? What objection canst
thou make against thy self, which the Lord doth not here punctually answer?</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Object. Thou sayest:</hi> I have been very sinful, and still continue so. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
Judgments do me no good; but make me more wanton, or more froward
in an evil way. <hi>Ans.</hi> Hark, the Lord tells thee, that he knows all this, He
<hi>hath seen thy ways,</hi> the <hi>Evil</hi> of thy ways, and every <hi>Aggravation</hi> of the Evil
in them: yet he saith: <hi>I will heal thee.</hi> He undertakes to be Himself thy Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Object. But thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with miseries, I am broken with horrours. And I have no Strength to recover
my self out of any of these. <hi>Ans.</hi> But the Lord Jesus saith: <hi>I will heal the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
of all these Evils, of thy Sins, thy Sorrows, and thy Fears. I will do it for thee,
by mine own Right Hand, and for mine own Sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:49838:60"/>
3. <hi>Obj.</hi> Still <hi>thou objectest</hi> against thine own Mercies, and complainest;
that thou knowest not Jesus Christ, nor the way to Him: Or if thou
didst; thou hast neither Will, nor Power to come to him, that thou mayst
be healed by Him. <hi>Ans.</hi> But what saith the Lord to thee? <hi>I will lead thee
also:</hi> I will first come to thee, I will stretch out my Hand towards thee, and
take hold of thy Spirit, I will draw thee towards my self, I will direct thee in
the right Paths of my Love, I will bear thee up in the way, that thou shalt
not fall <hi>in it,</hi> nor fall <hi>from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Obj.</hi> But thy Melancholy, Dark, and Sullen thoughts still abound in
thee, and suffer thee to have no Peace. These fill thee with Fears, and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings,
that thou canst not take comfort in any thing. <hi>Ans.</hi> But God will
<hi>restore comfort</hi> to thee, and <hi>to thy Mourners.</hi> He will bring again, that Comfort,
which thou hadst once in thy Spirit, which thou hadst in Paradise. It is now
but laid aside, hid, <hi>sown</hi> in thee. God will bring it forth to Light, and set it
before thee, and make it to grow up out of thine own Spirit, in the sight of
thy Spirit, and in the sight of all <hi>thy Mourners;</hi> all those melancholy thoughts,
which now fill thee with so much heaviness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will restore Comfort:</hi> Saith God. The Comfort, the Joy, for the want of
which thou Mournest, <hi>is thine already,</hi> it was <hi>thine Eternally,</hi> it was the <hi>Grace
given to thee before all times in Jesus Christ,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks to <hi>Timothy.</hi> But
as the <hi>Trees</hi> were first in the Creation, and then the <hi>Seed,</hi> and then again the
<hi>Trees</hi> are restored to themselves out of their Seed. So thy Comforts have been
hid in thine Heart, in which they lye in their proper Seed, and out of which
God will make them to grow up, and so restore them to thee, and thee to thy
Spiritual, and Heavenly self.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the <hi>Second Answer:</hi> The <hi>Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi>
may be <hi>sown</hi> though they be not <hi>grown</hi> up in thee.</p>
            <p>So I have done with the <hi>First Spirit</hi> to be <hi>silenc'd</hi> in the Soul that she may
have <hi>Peace;</hi> which is the <hi>Spirit of Wrath from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Spirit of the Devil.</hi> This is the <hi>Second Spirit</hi> to be <hi>silenced</hi> in the Soul
for her Spiritual Peace. Read those <hi>Verses,</hi> Psal. 46. 2. 3. <hi>Therefore we will
not fear, though the Earth be removed: and though the Mountains be carryed into
the midst of the Sea. Though the Waters thereof roar, and the Mountains shake
with the swelling thereof. Selah.</hi> In the verse following you read of a <hi>River,
whose streams refresh the City of God.</hi> This <hi>River is clearly the Spirit of God.</hi>
This <hi>Sea</hi> then, which troubles the <hi>Earth,</hi> must be the <hi>Spirit of the Devil,</hi> the
Natural Power of Darkness in the Creature, which, while it kept its own place,
and order, had a <hi>Beauty</hi> in it; but <hi>forsaking its own habitation,</hi> as St. <hi>Jude</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
it brings <hi>Confusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may confirm that sense of the <hi>Sea</hi> in this place, by comparing Two,
or Three places of Scripture more, one with another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. That Darkness, out of which the Light, and Strength of the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49838:60"/>
Creature was first raised, is express'd by a <hi>Sea: Darkness was upon the Face
of the Deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the Face of the Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Revel. 20. 3. The Angel casts the Devil into the Bottomless Pit.</hi> The

               </gap>; The <hi>Deep.</hi> The Devil was cast down into the great <hi>Deep</hi> of his
own Darkness, and shut up there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Revel. 21. 1. I saw a new Heaven, and a new Earth, and there was no
more Sea.</hi> The <hi>Spirit of the Devil,</hi> and the Power of Darkness was now shut up
in itself, and no more troubled the Peace and Beauty of the <hi>Creature.</hi> Though
there was still <hi>Night,</hi> and <hi>Day; Darkness,</hi> and <hi>Light;</hi> yet there was no more
<hi>Sea,</hi> the <hi>Darkness,</hi> was as a sweet Calm Stream refreshing the <hi>Earth,</hi> and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the <hi>Light</hi> of Life.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Sea</hi> of Darkness, and confusion lies at the bottom of the Spirit of every
man <hi>naturally.</hi> It encompasseth us on every side. This often opens itself upon
us, and the <hi>Mountains</hi> of all our Strength, Joy or Glory are swallowed up in
the midst of it.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Waters</hi> of this <hi>Sea,</hi> evil Spirits roar upon our Souls; they fill
them with Fear, amazement, and Horrour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sea</hi> is accounted the Cause of <hi>Earth-quakes.</hi> The Earth in a Man, all
the <hi>Foundations</hi> of his Life, and Joy are violently shaken in him, when this
<hi>Sea</hi> swells beneath them.</p>
            <p>What Peace, what Establishment can there be to the Soul, while this Power
of Darkness rageth? As the World shall have no Peace, till it be bound up
in its own Deep, so neither can the Soul.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Second Spirit to be silenced.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Spirit of a Man in Himself.</hi> Before the Soul can have Peace, her
own Spirit must be silent in the midst of her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 4. We have this advice given us: <hi>Commune with your own Heart
upon your Bed, and be still.</hi> This seems to be a Contradiction <hi>Commune,</hi> and <hi>be
still.</hi> But the <hi>Selah</hi> added, points out a more hidden sense.</p>
            <p>Here are <hi>Two Terms</hi> in this <hi>Scripture,</hi> which have a various Sense. <hi>Heart,</hi> and
<hi>Bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Heart. Commune with your Hearts.</hi> What is the Heart? The Heart is
the <hi>Inward Principle,</hi> the <hi>Life-Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Heart is the Inward Principle. <hi>So you read of the</hi> Heart of the Sea,
<hi>Exod. 15. 8. and the</hi> Heart of the Earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 40.</p>
            <p>Mark 7. 18. Whatsoever thing cometh from without, defileth not the Man.
<hi>v.</hi> 19. Because it entreth not into thy Heart, but into thy Belly; and passeth into
the Draughts. <hi>v.</hi> 21. From within, from the Heart of men proceed Evil thoughts,
Adulteries, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:49838:61"/>
The <hi>Meats,</hi> which we take in from without, reach the <hi>Body</hi> in all the parts
of it; and they reach the <hi>Soul,</hi> as it lives in the Body, working upon it, and
making changes in it. Both these then are the <hi>Belly,</hi> the <hi>Outward Man,</hi> which
is maintained from an <hi>Outward Principle,</hi> and passeth away into the <hi>Dust,</hi> and
<hi>Darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Heart</hi> is more <hi>Inward,</hi> and Immutable. It is that, which abides in
the <hi>Invisible</hi> part of things, and is that <hi>Hidden Spring,</hi> the <hi>Principle</hi> both of
Soul, and Body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> Heart <hi>in the</hi> Natural Man <hi>is the Spirit of Man, in the</hi> Spirit of the
Devil, <hi>or in the</hi> Spirit of Divine Wrath; <hi>or rather</hi> in both. <hi>So from the</hi> Heart
come evil thoughts. <hi>So St.</hi> Iohn <hi>saith,</hi> 1 Iohn. 3. 20. If our Hearts condem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
us, God is greater than our Hearts and knoweth all things. But if our Hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
us not, then have we confidence before God. <hi>Every man hath in him a</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<hi>more</hi> Inward, <hi>than the</hi> Spirit of the Devil, <hi>which is</hi> the Spirit of God, <hi>as
it comes forth into his Spirit, and gives his Spirit, a Created Invisible, Immortal
Being in itself among Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that <hi>Heart</hi> of man, with which he is to <hi>commune,</hi> this is the Seat of
<hi>Justification,</hi> Or <hi>Condemnation:</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Man,</hi> as it lives above in the <hi>Spirit</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> according to his <hi>Wrath,</hi> or his <hi>Love:</hi> Or the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the <hi>Principle of Nature,</hi> a <hi>Principle</hi> in the Spirit of Man.</p>
            <p>If this <hi>Heart condemn us;</hi> that is, the Spirit of God, as it is the Principle of
our Spirits: <hi>God is greater than our Hearts:</hi> that is, the Spirit of God, as it is
<hi>in itself,</hi> above our Spirits, hath a greater Fulness of Majesty, and Light in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
where it is, as the Light in the <hi>Sun;</hi> when as in our Spirits, it is, but as the
Light in the <hi>Star.</hi> If therefore it testifie <hi>Wrath</hi> to us in this <hi>relation,</hi> in which
it is, but as a <hi>Glance;</hi> it shall more fully testify wrath against us in that State
in which it is the <hi>Full Glory.</hi> As it is a <hi>Principle</hi> in our Spirits it opens itself
<hi>truly,</hi> but <hi>imperfectly:</hi> in a <hi>right Sense;</hi> but in a <hi>part</hi> only of <hi>its own Sense.</hi>
But as it is <hi>in itself,</hi> it <hi>knows all things;</hi> it opens itself to the utmost of its
own sense, and eternal purpose.</p>
            <p>A man should neither <hi>comfort,</hi> nor <hi>condemn</hi> himself from the language of
his own Spirit, as it lives in the Outward Soul, or Body, and speaks of <hi>its own.</hi>
This Spirit should be <hi>silent,</hi> and still.</p>
            <p>But we are to <hi>commune</hi> with the <hi>Divine Principle</hi> in us, with our Spirits, as
they dwell <hi>within,</hi> in the Spirit of God. For so the Spirit of God, and our
Spirits, are twisted in One, make <hi>One Heart,</hi> testify One thing, and that truly,
whether it be for Life, or for Death; from <hi>Wrath</hi> or from <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Spirit of God, and of Man in this Principle, are an <hi>Image</hi> of the
Spirit of God, as it is <hi>absolute,</hi> and supream in the God-Head.</p>
            <p>But there is a <hi>Heart, within this Heart.</hi> This Heart is a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> or
<hi>Death,</hi> Love or Wrath. There is within this a Heart, which is the <hi>Life-Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi>
and the <hi>Love-Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:49838:61"/>
2. <hi>The Heart is the Life-Principle.</hi> Prov. 4. 23. <hi>Keep thy Heart with all
Diligence: for out of it are the Issues of Life.</hi> What is this <hi>Heart,</hi> which we
are to <hi>keep,</hi> when we are to <hi>deny our selves?</hi> We are to keep it, not with <hi>Caution</hi>
to preserve our selves <hi>from</hi> it; but with <hi>Confidence,</hi> to preserve our selves <hi>by</hi> it.</p>
            <p>This place of <hi>Scripture</hi> is like that before it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 13. Where <hi>Solomon</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or <hi>Instruction,</hi> saith: <hi>Keep her, for she is thy Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jesus Christ, as he is in the Spirit, is our <hi>Life-Principle,</hi> Colos. 3. 4. <hi>When
Christ, who is our Life shall appear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is the <hi>Treasure</hi> of our Hearts, and our truest <hi>Heart.</hi> For <hi>from Him,</hi> as He
is in the Spirituality of his own Person, are the <hi>Issues,</hi> the Out-goings, <hi>of our
Life,</hi> Mat. 6. 21. <hi>Where your Treasure is, there will your Hearts be also.</hi> Our
<hi>Treasure,</hi> and our <hi>Hearts</hi> are both with Jesus Christ in Heaven, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Heart,</hi> is the <hi>Treasury</hi> of all good things. <hi>A good man out of the good
Treasury of his Heart bringeth forth good things, Mat.</hi> 12. 35. Jesus Christ
is this <hi>Heart,</hi> which hath the <hi>Treasure</hi> in it. <hi>For in him are all the Treasures of
Wisdom, and Knowledge hid, Colos.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ is the <hi>Heart.</hi> as he is the <hi>Head</hi> of Man, 1 <hi>Corin. 11. 3. The
Head of every Man is Christ: The Head of Christ is God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Jesus, as he is the <hi>Heavenly Man,</hi> is the most proper <hi>Head,</hi> and
<hi>Heart</hi> of man: the <hi>First Principle</hi> before all others, the most <hi>inward Principle</hi>
lying within, and beneath all other Principles; the <hi>Life-Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see, what the Heart is.</p>
            <p>1. Jesus Christ, as He puts forth Himself in the Natural Spirit of Man, to
be the <hi>Principle of Nature</hi> either, in a Power of <hi>Wrath,</hi> or <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Jesus Christ, as He is in his own Heavenly Spirit, and Person, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
the Life, Perfection, and Blessedness of Man in Himself, as in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Root, or Treasury.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Bed.</hi> This is the <hi>Second</hi> thing, of which we are to seek the meaning.
We read of a <hi>Bed of Tribulation, Revel.</hi> 2. 22. This <hi>Bed</hi> is a <hi>Spirit</hi> of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Weakness, Woe, and Torment.</p>
            <p>We read of a <hi>Bed in Tribulation,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> prepares for those, whom he
loves, <hi>Psal. 41. 3. Thou wilt make all his Bed in his Sickness,</hi> or, <hi>Thou
wilt turn it,</hi> the <hi>Inside</hi> of Peace, Love, and Glory, for the <hi>Outside</hi> of Pain, and
Trouble: or thou wilt <hi>change</hi> it from a <hi>Bed of Languishings,</hi> into a <hi>Bed of Rest,</hi>
or a <hi>Bed of Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Beds of Joy, and Glory,</hi> Psal. 149. 5. <hi>Let the Saints be joyful
in Glory, let them Sing aloud on their Beds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Canticles</hi> there is mention made of the <hi>Bed of Christ, and His Spouse:</hi>
Can. 1. 16. <hi>Our bed is Green.</hi> There is also <hi>Solomons Bed,</hi> who was a Type
of the Heavenly Bridegroom, <hi>Cant. 3. 7. Behold his Bed, which is Solomons,

                  </gap>re valiant men are about it, of the valiant men of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Bed</hi> is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord Jesus, which shines forth, and buds with
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49838:62"/>
Sweetness, and Beauty, which goes forth in the midst of the <hi>Angels,</hi> cloathing
itself with those Mighty, and Glorious Spirits. This <hi>Spirit</hi> draws the Soul
forth from the Tumults of the Flesh, takes her off from her own Strength, and
casts her upon itself, as upon a <hi>Bed</hi> of Rest.</p>
            <p>By this time we see, what the Holy Ghost means by the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the <hi>Bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now return to that place of that <hi>Psalmist,</hi> for the <hi>opening</hi> of which
we have brought in all these Scriptures, <hi>Psal. 4. 4. Commune with your own
Heart upon your Bed, and be still:</hi> that is, discourse not with your Spirit, as it
lives in this Body, upon these Outward Appearances. For so it is one with the
<hi>Strange Woman,</hi> it is a <hi>Strange Heart:</hi> it is a Fountain, that makes itself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and defiles itself; it is not <hi>your own Fountain alone,</hi> your <hi>own Heart;</hi> but
a <hi>wandring, false, lying Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Retire your self into your <hi>Chamber,</hi> in which the <hi>Candle</hi> of the Lord shines;
that is, into your <hi>Spirit,</hi> as it hath the Spirit of God, for the Spring of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
Light, and Life in it. Here wait quietly, and silently for the <hi>openings</hi> of the
Spirit of God in the secret Voice of <hi>Nature</hi> within you.</p>
            <p>But, stay not here, <hi>Silence</hi> this Spirit too, draw your self yet more <hi>inward,</hi>
into the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord Jesus, as He is the <hi>Inward Man,</hi> within, the more
inward than, the secretest Retirements of the Natural Spirit.</p>
            <p>Here cast thy self upon thy <hi>Bed</hi> in thy <hi>Heart,</hi> and commune with thy <hi>Heart</hi>
upon thy <hi>Bed.</hi> This is thy <hi>Bed,</hi> and thy <hi>Heart</hi> both in one. Here lay thy self
at Rest, upon this Spirit, which is the <hi>Comforter;</hi> advise with this Spirit, which
is the only <hi>Counsellor,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Truth.</hi> So be <hi>thou still,</hi> let thine own Spirit,
the Spirit of <hi>this World,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> in thee be <hi>silent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that thus hearkens in <hi>Silence,</hi> what the Lord will say, shall certainly hear
him speak <hi>Peace</hi> to his Saints.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God in thy <hi>Natural Man</hi> may speak of <hi>Wrath</hi> to thee; and
God will confirm that voice of Wrath in the Spirit of thy Natural Man. And
so here thou canst find no <hi>Bed</hi> to comfort thee. But go a little beyond thy <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Man,</hi> and thou shalt meet with the Spirit of God, as it is in its own Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Fulness in the Lord Jesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Here is a <hi>Bed</hi> ready prepared for thee. Now
silence thine own Spirit for ever; and hear no more, what the Spirit in thine
own Spirit speaks; but, what this Spirit speaks, as it is here, <hi>in Jesus Christ;</hi>
and this Spirit will certainly make thee to hear the voice of Joy, and Gladness.
Thus <hi>the Lord giveth his Beloved Rest:</hi> not <hi>in themselves,</hi> but <hi>in Himself.</hi>
            </p>

<hi>Silencing</hi> of a <hi>Three-fold Spirit;</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wrath</hi> from God; the <hi>Spirit</hi> of

            <p>2. <hi>Part: Satisfaction.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> Part of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Peace is <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>

1. <hi>A Sweet League with all things.</hi> There can be no <hi>Satisfaction,</hi>
where there is any thing <hi>wanting,</hi> and <hi>not made up;</hi> or any thing <hi>Crooked,</hi> and
<hi>not made straight:</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1. 15. There is no <hi>Satisfaction,</hi>
where there is Division, or Contention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends promiseth this <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to <hi>Job, Job 5. 23. Thou shalt be in
League with the Stones of the Field, and the Beasts of the Field shall be at Peace
with thee.</hi> v. 24. <hi>And thou shalt know, that thy Tabernacle shall be in Peace.</hi>
Behold a <hi>League</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h all things below thee, <hi>Beasts,</hi> and Stones: Principles, and
Appearances of Life descending are the <hi>Beasts:</hi> The <hi>Stones</hi> are the Principles
and Appearances of Darkness descended to the lowest, the Dead Images of
things. Behold a <hi>League</hi> here with all things above thee; <hi>thy Tabernacle shall
be in Peace.</hi> The <hi>Powers</hi> above thee are thy Tabernacle: The <hi>Angels</hi> are thy
<hi>Tabernacle, God</hi> is thy <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> Thou shalt dwell peaceably in these. These
shall be in <hi>Peace,</hi> not in stormy or fiery Appearances upon thee.</p>
            <p>Behold a <hi>League</hi> with all <hi>Times,</hi> with <hi>Eternity: Thou shalt know, that thy
Tabernacle shall be in Peace.</hi> Thou shalt not fear, what is to come; because all
Times to come shall be in Covenant with thee. Whatever Times come to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
still thy Tabernacle, thy Angel, thy God shall be peace upon thee; and
this thou shalt know before hand.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>League</hi> with all things, which <hi>Jobs</hi> Friend promiseth to him,
without which there can be no <hi>Satisfaction</hi> or <hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But you will perhaps ask me, how this <hi>League</hi> is made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I <hi>answer,</hi> that it is made by living in the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This
<hi>Spirit</hi> in you is this <hi>League</hi> or Covenant. For the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Unity,</hi> and hath
the <hi>Band of Peace</hi> in itself, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
            <p>The Lord, who is the Spirit, is call'd, the <hi>God of the Spirits of all Flesh, Num.</hi>
16. 12. and 27. 16. This place agrees with that, <hi>Luk. 20. 38. God is the
God of the Living, not of the Dead, for all things live to Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As our Saviour said; <hi>that Little Children had their Angels, which beheld the
Face of God in Heaven:</hi> So it is most true, that each <hi>Fleshly</hi> Appearance hath
its <hi>Spirit</hi> in which it lives <hi>with,</hi> and <hi>to</hi> God. Every <hi>Beast,</hi> or <hi>Stone</hi> hath its
<hi>Angel,</hi> in which it is <hi>comprehended</hi> after a <hi>living</hi> manner, and <hi>by</hi> which it is <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</hi>
Every <hi>Angel</hi> hath its <hi>Spirit</hi> in Jesus Christ, <hi>in</hi> which itself is again <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended</hi>
after a <hi>Divine</hi> manner, and <hi>by</hi> which it is <hi>entirely managed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Spirits</hi> of all things are in the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Jesus Christ. The <hi>Spirit</hi>
of every Creature, which is the <hi>Scepter,</hi> that sways it, the <hi>Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>d</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ, and goes forth from between his Feet.</p>
            <p>If then thou wouldst be in <hi>League</hi> with all things, and at Peace with them:
be thou <hi>One Spirit</hi> with Jesus Christ; so all Things, and Times shall be <hi>One
Spirit</hi> with thee; and this <hi>Unity of Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Bond of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To be Spiritually-minded is Life, and Peace, Rom.</hi> 8. 6. If thou wouldst live
comfortably, take h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d of dw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lling in the <hi>Fleshly Tabernacle,</hi> in the Fleshly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49838:63"/>
and rellish of things. Let thy understanding, and Soul abide in the Spirit
of God. So thou shalt converse always, every where with <hi>lively,</hi> and <hi>lovely</hi>
Objects. All things round about thee, within thee, without thee, shall have
Life, and a Harmony, a Tuneableness with themselves, and with thy Spirit, a
Peace-fulness in their Life. All things shall have an <hi>Angelical Life</hi> and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to <hi>thee</hi> as they have to the <hi>Elect Angels.</hi> All things shall have a <hi>Divine
Life</hi> and Sweetness to <hi>thee,</hi> as they have to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First thing,</hi> in which <hi>Satisfaction</hi> consists, a <hi>Sweet League with
all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. A Satisfactory Rest in this League. <hi>This is the</hi> Second <hi>Thing, in which
the</hi> Satisfaction <hi>of</hi> Spiritual Peace <hi>confists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Es.</hi> 14. 3. And it shall come to pass in that day; the Lord shall give thee Rest
from thy Sorrow, and from thy Fear, and from thy hard Bondage, wherein thou
wast made to serve.</p>
            <p>Poor Soul! while thou livest in the Darkness of Fleshly things, thou hast
<hi>Sorrow</hi> breaking thee by the Oppression of <hi>present</hi> Evils, thou hast <hi>Fear</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
thee with the expectation of more Evils yet to <hi>come,</hi> thou hast thy Desires
carried forth uncessantly, and violently toward those Objects which cannot sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy,
but divide, disappoint, and distract them, making them to labour under a
hard Bondage, to work in the <hi>Fire,</hi> and feed on the <hi>Wind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> comes; then the Soul
<hi>is in Covenant</hi> with all things; she hath all Evils subdued to her, so her <hi>Passionate</hi>
part is Satisfied, and calm; she hath all good things freely to enjoy, so her <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires</hi>
are at rest in the bosom of their proper Objects; thus the whole Soul hath
Peace, all her Faculties <hi>acquiesce</hi> in their several Perfections, all her Powers move
with a full Complacency in their several Operations.</p>
            <p>Thus that is made good which is prophesied in another place, <hi>Es. 32. 17.
The work of Righteousness shall be Peace, and the Effect of Righteousness, Quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Assurance for ever.</hi> When thou hast the Lord Jesus in the Spirit, then
thou hast <hi>Righteousness</hi> brought forth to <hi>victory</hi> in thee. For all things are then
gathered up into <hi>One Body,</hi> or Fulness of Divine Glory in thy Soul. Now thou
hast <hi>Peace</hi> with <hi>Quietness,</hi> and <hi>Assurance</hi> for ever. This is the <hi>Satisfactory Rest,</hi>
when no <hi>Passion</hi> hath any thing, to <hi>disturb</hi> it, no <hi>Desire</hi> wants any thing to
<hi>distract</hi> it. But all is <hi>quiet</hi> in the Soul for <hi>present,</hi> and <hi>assured</hi> to <hi>Eternity.</hi> This
God doth, when he brings us into his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which is the <hi>Unity of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much for the <hi>Second Property</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> which is Peace
in the <hi>Two</hi> Parts of it, <hi>Silence,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Use. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Direction.</hi> If you would have <hi>Peace,</hi> understand, and distinguish
rightly the <hi>Grounds</hi> of your trouble. As they are <hi>Three,</hi> so you shall know them
by their several ways of <hi>working.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1, <hi>Ground.</hi> The <hi>Spirit of Wrath</hi> from God hath its way of Working in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49838:63"/>
the Soul peculiar to itself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It makes <hi>present Impressions</hi> of Trouble, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.
But it doth it with an <hi>Absoluteness,</hi> an <hi>Arbitrariness,</hi> laying no <hi>Premises,</hi>
drawing no <hi>Conclusions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the great <hi>Dispute</hi> between <hi>Job,</hi> and his <hi>Friends. Job</hi> complained
that <hi>God set a Watch over him;</hi> a <hi>Spirit</hi> of trouble, that should suffer him to
take no Rest, no way, on no side: that He <hi>scar'd him with Visions, and frighted
him with Dreams;</hi> God appointed a <hi>Spirit</hi> over him, which fill'd him sleeping
and waking with dreadful Appearances, <hi>Job<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 7. 12. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends charge him to have Iniquity in his Hand, <hi>Job</hi> 11. 14. And
Hypocrisy in his Heart, <hi>Job</hi> 8. 13. otherwise say they: <hi>Thou shouldst have
prosper'd still; thy hopes should not thus have perished.</hi> So they laid <hi>Premises</hi> to
the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God, which fell upon <hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other side <hi>Job</hi> maintains; the <hi>Vanity</hi> of this Life, where <hi>all things
fall alike to all:</hi> the <hi>Absoluteness</hi> of God, who deals alike with all <hi>at Pleasure:</hi>
the <hi>Slightness,</hi> and <hi>Shadowiness</hi> of Man in this Fleshly State, where God alike
sweeps away the Lives, and Glories of all sorts of men, as <hi>Shadows:</hi> The <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
of Afflictions in the Saints: the <hi>Propriety</hi> of this State of things, which
is properly subject to the Principalities, and Powers of Darkness, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 22.
23. 24. <hi>He destroyeth the Perfect, and the Wicked.</hi> None therefore can say, that
any Sufferings are a <hi>Sign</hi> of a Reprobate Man, or of Hatred in God. <hi>If the
Scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the Tryal of the Innocent.</hi> God will laugh
at the miseries of a Good man, as being, but a <hi>Melancholy Dream,</hi> when the
Man is asleep, which wakes him, and he finds himself well in Glory. <hi>The Earth
is given into the Hand of the Wicked, and hath covered the face of the Judges
of it.</hi> It is <hi>improper</hi> to expect any thing right in <hi>this State,</hi> which is the <hi>Season</hi>
for Darkness, and the time of the Reign of those Spirits which are the Powers
of Darkness, under whom the good Angels are vailed, and imprisoned.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Job</hi> shews his Friends how they <hi>plead deceitfully for God.</hi> And <hi>Job</hi>
hath this Testimony given him by God, that <hi>his Friends had not spoken right
things of God, as he had done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> would grant, that he had sinn'd. But the Lord could forgive him all
his Sins, and he knew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>His Redeemer liv'd, his Record was on High.</hi> He would
never grant that his <hi>Sufferings</hi> were any Argument of his Sinfulness, or want
of Sincerity in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeremy</hi> complains, <hi>Lamen. 3. 6. He hath set me in dark places, as they that
be dead of old.</hi> The <hi>Spirit of Wrath</hi> from God can make itself a Prison of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to thee, depriving thee of all the Sweet, Comfortable, Lightsom Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of things; leaving thee only Shady, Frightful, Empty, Melancholy
Shapes hovering about thee, as they that are Dead. This Spirit can keep thee in
this Darkness, that thou shalt find no way out of it, by Friends, Ordinances,
Prayers, Endeavours of thy Spirit within thee. This Spirit can bind thee fast
up in itself, sit heavy upon thee, sink thee still lower, as a <hi>Chain.</hi> So he goes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49838:64"/>
on complaining, v. 7. <hi>He hath bedg'd me about; he hath made my Chain heavy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Spirit of Wrath</hi> from God never draws forth any uncomfortable <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions</hi>
for <hi>Eternity.</hi> No when such thoughts as these arise: <hi>I am cast away for
ever: I shall be eternally damn'd in Hell.</hi> These thoughts are not from the Spirit
of God, but from some other Spirit. And so <hi>Jeremy</hi> brings them in. v. 18.
<hi>I said; my Hope, and my Strength is perished from the Lord.</hi> It is not: <hi>He, the
Lord said,</hi> though he were <hi>in His Wrath:</hi> but, <hi>I said.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see, how we may know, when the <hi>Spirit of Wrath from God</hi> is the
<hi>Ground</hi> of our Inward Trouble.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Four-fold Remedy</hi> against this <hi>Trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Remedy: Resignation.</hi> Say in the midst of this Darkness, and Fear: <hi>It
is the Lord, let him do, whatsoever pleaseth him.</hi> I am in <hi>His arms,</hi> these are <hi>His
ways</hi> with me. Can the same Fountain bring forth Bitter, and Sweet Waters?
Be not deceived, be not disturbed O my Soul, but leave thy self with God, as
<hi>a Faithful Creator;</hi> let him make, what He will of thee. <hi>The Word of the Lord,</hi>
every Appearance, in which God comes forth unto thee, <hi>is good.</hi> Fear not to
receive him, and to sit down, though it be in Darkness: for then thou sittest
under <hi>his Shadow.</hi> Only neither <hi>take from,</hi> nor <hi>add</hi> to his Words, or Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in thee; by the Suggestions of any other Spirit.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Remedy: Retirement.</hi> Withdraw from the Fleshly Man, together with
this <hi>Pillar</hi> of Clouds and Fire; which sits upon that. Draw thy Spirit up to
the Unchangeable Spirit of Glory, and the State of thy Spiritual Man in that
Glory. So did <hi>Job: My Record is on High.</hi> Appeal from that Testimony, or
Discovery, which God gives of Himself below in thy Earthly Man; to that
Testimony, or Discovery, which God gives of thee, above, in the Simplicity,
and Nakedness of His Divine Nature. So did <hi>Paul: Of such a man I will boast;
a man caught up into the Third Heavens, into Paradise.</hi> Though thou canst see
nothing but anger, and frowns in the Face of Jesus Christ, as thou seest that
in thy Flesh below: yet thou mayst see Joys and Glories in thy self, as thou
seest thy Person in the Heavenly Person of the Lord Jesus above.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Remedy: Prayer.</hi> Cry to God continually for Two Things: <hi>First,</hi>
that <hi>He would take his Hand off from you.</hi> No means, or Power can remove
your Trouble, till the Hand of God be removed. 'Tis that, holds down your
Eyes, that you cannot see the Light of Comfort. No art, or force, can remove
the Hand of God, till Himself please to do it: The Second is, that <hi>He would
turn unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Remedy: Waiting. Submit,</hi> and <hi>Wait. I waited patiently for the Lord,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd he inclined unto me:</hi> Saith <hi>David.</hi> Give the Lord leave first to sit down
Himself, and Feast on his own Will, and thy Comforts; while thou waitest, and
ministrest all thy Peace, and Strength to Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then will God say to thee: Sit
thou down, and Feast upon thy Will in mine, upon thy Joys together with mine.</p>
            <p>So much for the <hi>Discovery,</hi> and <hi>Remedies</hi> of the <hi>First Ground</hi> of Inward
Trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:49838:64"/>
2. <hi>Ground: The Spirit of the Devil,</hi> when he is the cause of Trouble, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests
himself by his <hi>Lying Arts;</hi> and <hi>Murthering Aims.</hi> He increaseth thy
Feelings by <hi>Fears,</hi> and thy Darkness by <hi>false Reasonings.</hi> He would teach thee,
to argue against thy self from the <hi>present Anger</hi> of the Lord towards thee
that he <hi>eternally hates</hi> thee. He would teach thee to dispute against thy self; that
no <hi>Sufferings</hi> are like unto thine, and therefore never any <hi>Sinner</hi> like unto thee.
What clear Falshoods are these, when God plainly affirms in his word: that
<hi>All things come alike to all, and no man can know either Love, or Hatred by any
thing under the Sun?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Devil</hi> is ever drawing <hi>Inferences</hi> of <hi>Despair</hi> from <hi>Desertions,</hi> prompting
thee to such Language, as this in thy Spirit: <hi>This Evil is from the Lord; why
should I wait any louger upon him? There is no hope for me in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Devil</hi> is known by <hi>Lies</hi> leading to <hi>Despair,</hi> which leads to <hi>Death,</hi>
and <hi>Destruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one Remedy against this Ground of Trouble besides those mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before, and that is this: Resist the Devil, and he will fly from you.</p>
            <p>Beat back his Suggestions, by stopping your Ears against them. Answer
him, that <hi>he is the Accuser of the Father, and the Brethren one to another.</hi> When
he puts into you Dark thoughts of God; Despairing thoughts towards God;
that he is a <hi>Lyar,</hi> and a <hi>Murtherer.</hi> But God is <hi>Light,</hi> and there is no Darkness
in Him: God is <hi>Love,</hi> aad Fury is not in Him. All these <hi>Fears</hi> are <hi>thy weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and thy Low Estate, in which thou sufferest with Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Property.</hi> The <hi>Third Property</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom of God is Joy.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 19, 20. joyns these Two, <hi>Joy,</hi> and a <hi>Crown: Ye are my Joy, and
my Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spiritual Joy</hi> hath <hi>Three</hi> Parts.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>Exaltation</hi> of the Soul.</item>
               <item>2. The <hi>Enlargement.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. The <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi>
of the Soul <hi>in God.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Part:</hi> The <hi>Exaltation of the Soul in God is Two-fold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1, There is a Spiritual <hi>Exaltation</hi> of the Soul <hi>over</hi> her Spiritual Enemies.
2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 27, It is said of <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> and all <hi>Israel,</hi> that, <hi>they returned to
Jerusalem with joy. For God had made them to rejoyce over all their Enemies.</hi>
This is a <hi>Figure</hi> of the Souls Joy over her Spiritual Enemies; when Jesus Christ
brings her, as a Conqueror into the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the <hi>Jerusalem above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Exaltation,</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> is described in the Person of our Lord Jesus: <hi>Colos.
2. 15. He spoyled Principalities and Powers, making a shew of them openly trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing
over them.</hi> Thus is her Royal State, set above the <hi>Principalities</hi> of Hell,
the <hi>Powers</hi> of Darkness; Corruptions, <hi>Temptations,</hi> Death, and Devils. She sees
them set under her <hi>Feet,</hi> that is, beneath her lowest Appearance; She sees them
<hi>spoyled</hi> of all <hi>power</hi> to hurt, and <hi>glory</hi> to tempt her. She <hi>shews</hi> them, and makes
them manifest in the Light of God. She <hi>Triumphs</hi> over them, exalts herself,
and rejoyceth over them; raising a Joy, and a Praise to herself, and her Saviour
out of them.</p>

                  </gap>shly Appearances</hi> of Christ are the <hi>Talents</hi> un-multiplyed, the <hi>Corn</hi>
abiding alone. While they so continue, they are solitary, melancholy, bearing
little fruit of Glory to God, or Joy to the Soul. But then the Soul casts these
<hi>Talents</hi> into the <hi>Bank,</hi> then she sows this <hi>Corn,</hi> when she resigns them to God,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49838:65"/>
when she crucifies them, and dies to them by the power of the Death of the
Lord Jesus in her.</p>
            <p>Now the Soul hath them within her <hi>rising again</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> after a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
manner. Now she receives them again with an <hi>increase</hi> of Holiness, Peace,
and Joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the Lord Jesus saith to the Soul:</hi> Well done, good, and faithful Servant;

hast submitted them to my will, and yielded them up to the power of my Death. I
therefore will make thee ruler over many. Thou shalt no more be subject to low,
and single Appearances. Thou shalt reign in the power, plenty, and variety of more
Glorious Manifesta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions. Enter thou into these high, and Spiritual Discoveries of
God, in which thy Lord and Saviour now enjoys Himself. So the Kingdom, and
Ioy of the Lord shall be thy Kingdom, and Ioy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Use. 1. <hi>Examination.</hi> There is nothing of more concernment to us, than
to <hi>distinguish,</hi> and discern aright our <hi>Joys. Sensual,</hi> and carnal <hi>Joys</hi> are apt to
make us sensual, and fleshly, ignorant, and brutish, as the <hi>Beasts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Delusive Joys</hi>
make our Souls, as <hi>Devils</hi> in the form of Angels of Light. <hi>Spiritual Joys,</hi>
when they are truly such, make us most like to God.</p>
            <p>The Delights of <hi>Nature,</hi> and sense are <hi>indifferent</hi> things, <hi>lawful, if they be
lawfully used.</hi> They are therefore to be taken with much moderation, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the <hi>Wine,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of to <hi>Timothy: Drink not alwaies Water:
but drink a little Wine for thy healths sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Delusions,</hi> and false Raptures of Spirit are a <hi>sweet</hi> Poyson, which are taken
in greedily, and kill so much the more speedily. The Soul is naked, open, free,
simple in her joys, she mingles herself inwardly, and deeply with the Spirit of
her joys: As <hi>Herod</hi> offered to the half of his Kingdom to <hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dias,</hi> when she
pleased him, with dancing before him.</p>
            <p>It is then a thing of great moment to understand the nature of our Joys
that we may know, <hi>when</hi> to admit, and to reject them; <hi>How,</hi> and to what
height, to cherish, or check them;</p>
            <p>I will propound <hi>Four Tryals</hi> of our Joy.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Tryal.</hi> The First Tryal is this. <hi>Spiritual Joys ever spring from a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
sense of the Love of God towards us. Rom.</hi> 5. St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of his <hi>Joy.</hi>
v. 5. <hi>Rejoycing in the hope of the Glory of God.</hi> He goes on discoursing of the
growth, strength, effects of this Joy. Then v. 5. He shews you the Ground
of his Joy: <hi>The Love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost that
he hath given us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Spiritual Joys can give an account, and a reason of themselves. There are
<hi>Three things,</hi> which go to make up the <hi>Reason</hi> of Spiritual Joy, when it is Right.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Love of God,</hi> not any Loveliness of our own, or the Sweetness of
any Creature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:49838:66"/>
2. The <hi>Discovery</hi> of this Love in an open, manifest way, with a <hi>Fulness,</hi>
and <hi>Clearness;</hi> like a <hi>Liquor</hi> that is poured forth, and spread abroad.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> making this Discovery, and evidencing it by his own
presence, and power in the Soul. This is the <hi>Reason,</hi> which Spiritual Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings,
and Gloryings give of themselves: <hi>The Love of God shed abroad in our
Hearts, by the Holy Ghost, which he hath given us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are your <hi>Joys</hi> ignorant, sudden, and violent, such, as spring from no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
cause, and can give no account of themselves?</p>
            <p>Whence do your Joys arise from a Sense of the Love of God, or from a
Reflection upon your Selves, upon any thing, <hi>of,</hi> or <hi>in</hi> the Creature?</p>
            <p>Whence have you your <hi>Sense</hi> of the Love of God? Is it wrought upon you
by <hi>Fancy,</hi> by the strength, and frequency of Imagination; or by the <hi>Persuasions</hi>
of your own Souls; or by the <hi>Reasonings</hi> of your own Hearts consulting with
themselves, and with the Letter of the Scriptures, without the Holy Ghost;
by any of the Words, or ways of mans Wisdom, or Power, without you or
within you?</p>
            <p>If your <hi>Joys</hi> be such, as these, you have reason to suspect, and fear them,
least they be from the <hi>Father of Lies,</hi> and not from the <hi>Father of Lights;</hi> from
the Fountain of bitterness, and enmity, not of sweetnes, and Love.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Tryal.</hi> The Second Tryal of your Joy <hi>is</hi> the <hi>Effect</hi> of it. <hi>Spiritual
Joys increase Spiritual Strength in the Soul as they increase themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nehem. 8. 10. Go your ways, <hi>saith</hi> Nehemiah <hi>to the People,</hi> Eat the Fat,
and Drink the Sweet, and send portions to them, for whom nothing is prepared.
For this day is holy to the Lord. Be ye not sorry: for the Ioy of the Lord is your
Strength. <hi>Thus the Lord</hi> Iesus <hi>speaks to the Soul in the Ministry of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel:</hi>
Go your ways, Feed upon the Fat of my Glory, Drink the Sweet of my Love.
Sond forth Portious, and Manifestations of this Glory, and Love to them, who
have nothing of it yet prepared, and set forth in their own Spirits. This day is holy
to me; in it you are to live altogether to me, and in the Light of my Appearances.
Then let not your Hearts be heavy, nor your countenances sad, For my Ioy shall not
weaken, or betray you. My Ioy shall be a Pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rvative against Corruptions, a
Strength against Temptation, the Power of a new life carrying you up on high into
further Communion with God, and Conformity to him.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Threefold Joy</hi> that takes to itself often the name of being <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. A <hi>Joy</hi> flowing from our <hi>natural temper,</hi> and Complexion, from spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of Blood, or Flashings of melancholy is many times mistaken for a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Joy. But this Joy <hi>dissolves,</hi> it makes the Soul airy, light, and loose: it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the Soul to Vanity, and Sin.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> brought forth by an <hi>Evil Spirit of Delusion</hi> carries the Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a Spiritual Joy. This <hi>swells</hi> the Soul, makes it vain-glorious, confident,
secure in itself. In this State the Soul easily falis <hi>into</hi> Temptation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asily falls <hi>in</hi>
the Temptation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:49838:66"/>
3. <hi>Spiritual Joy</hi> truly so called. This <hi>Knits</hi> the Union between Christ and
the Soul more close, and strong: It gathers up the Soul more fully into the Spirit
of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>John</hi> saith: <hi>He that dwells in Love, dwells in God.</hi> It is as true: He that
dwells in Spiritual Joys, dwells of a Truth in the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>Vanity, Lust, Passion, Pride come to the Soul in other Joys, and find her fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
for them. But, when they come to the Soul in her Spiritual Joy, so far, as
she is in that Joy, they find nothing in her, nothing to comply with them.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Second Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Tryal. <hi>The</hi> Third Tryal <hi>of</hi> Spiritual Ioy <hi>is the</hi> Quality <hi>of it.</hi> Spiritual
Ioy is a Glorious Ioy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. You Rejoyce with Ioy Glorious, and unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Spiritual Ioy <hi>hath a Spiritual Glory resting upon it, and puts a Spiritual
Glory upon the Spirit, and Person of that man, in whom it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spiritual Joy</hi> ariseth from a sight of the Glory of God. Therefore it hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
forth the Image of this Glory in the Spirit, and in all its workings.</p>
            <p>Try your Joys by this: What of the Glory of God? What of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Gospel? What of the Heavenly Man? What of the Spiritual
manifestations of the Lord Jesus have you seen, or known? St. <hi>James</hi> saith,
that; <hi>Faith is dead without works,</hi> that is, without the life, and power of God
working in you. So <hi>Joy</hi> without the <hi>Spiritual Discoveries</hi> of God in it, is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
dead and empty.</p>
            <p>Tell me not, that your Heart is full of <hi>Joy.</hi> But unfold to me those <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,</hi>
those Shinings out of God, which you have met with in your Spirits.
So shew me your <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>But you will say perhaps:</hi> I see a Glory, but it is unexpressible, and you
are uncapable of it.</p>
            <p>Ans. <hi>I answer to that</hi> Four Things.</p>
            <p>1. A <hi>Spiritual Glory</hi> cannot be exprest by any <hi>inferiour Principle,</hi> or Power,
by any abilities of the Natural man. But it can express itself. As it can <hi>be,</hi> so it
can be <hi>manifested</hi> in the Soul. Spiritual things give a <hi>Subsistance</hi> to themselves
in the Natural man: So they can give an <hi>Expression</hi> to themselves there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8. The Word is nigh thee in thy Heart, and in thy Mouth. <hi>v.</hi> 10.
With the Heart man believeth unto Righteousness, with the Mouth man confesseth
unto Salvation. <hi>The Life of Christ, who is the Glory of God, hath a</hi> Mouth
<hi>as well as a</hi> Heart <hi>in the Soul of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Glory</hi> of God unites itself to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Principle</hi> of man, for the
adopting of him, and entituling of him to Heaven; for his <hi>Justification.</hi> It
puts forth itself by the <hi>Mouth,</hi> thorow the whole <hi>Image</hi> of the man, for the
Change, and Transfiguration of that; for his <hi>Glorification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. Secondly; it is true, that the Glory of God in the Soul cannot
express itself, in its <hi>own Form,</hi> thorow the natural man. But it can express
itself by <hi>Earthly Images,</hi> by <hi>Types,</hi> and Figures; so as to convince even Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:49838:67"/>
Jesus Christ so shewed forth the Glory of his Father, while he lived in Flesh,
that the very Officers which came to apprehend him, confessed, and said: <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
man spake like this man: John</hi> 7. 46. He spake to their sense, <hi>as having
Authority;</hi>

               </gap> He put forth thorow his Flesh, Declarations, of that Power
of Light, and Divine Glory, which dwelt in him, beyond all that any other
Spirit, or Principle could send forth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans. 3. Thirdly,</hi> though a Spiritual Glory cannot evidence, or testifie itself
to <hi>Natural</hi> men, yet it may to such as are <hi>Spiritual. As Face answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Face in
a Glass, so doth the Heart of man:</hi> Saith <hi>Solomon. Prov.</hi> 27. 19. So doth the
Spiritual Heart of man. There is a <hi>Proportion</hi> between Spiritual men, and
Spiritual things. The Glory of God in one Heart shews itself to the Glory
of God in another Heart, thorow the <hi>Natural man,</hi> as a Face shews itself to
itself in a <hi>Glass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear, what the Spirit saith to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Revel.</hi> 2. 7. A Spiritual man hath an <hi>Ear</hi> in his Heart by which he can
hear, and take in thorow the outward Ear, the things spoken by the Spirit,
even as they are inwardly spoken by the Spirit in its own Language.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Spirit of the Prophets is subject to the Prophets,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, 1 Corin.
14. 32. Spiritual men</hi> can judge of the Workings, the Appearances, the Joys,
the Glories of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in another man; as <hi>Rational men</hi> can judge of <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 4. Spiritual <hi>Joy</hi> is as unexpr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssible, as Spiritual <hi>Glory.</hi> You may hold
forth, as much of one, as of the other. If you can declare nothing of either
distinctly, and clearly; then both are at the best, but confused and uncertain
in your Souls.</p>
            <p>Spiritual <hi>Love,</hi> and Spiritual <hi>Joy</hi> have both this <hi>Property;</hi> they set the Heart
on work, to be ever <hi>enditing a good matter,</hi> sweet matter, <hi>touching the King,</hi> the
Glory of the Lord Jesus. They make the <hi>Tongue</hi> of a man <hi>like the Pen of a
ready writer, Psal.</hi> 45. 1. sweetly, swiftly, forming, and warbling forth distinct
Expressions of the Divine Glory.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the <hi>Third Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Tryal.</hi> The Fourth Tryal of Spiritual Joy is this: <hi>Spiritual Joy is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Natural man.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. <hi>Joy Glorious, and Unspeakable. 1 Cor.</hi> 2.
9. The <hi>Eye</hi> sees not; the <hi>Ear</hi> hears not; the <hi>Heart</hi> takes not in the Spiritual
Joys of a Christian. Sense, Fancy, Reason, all the Faculties, and Powers of the
Rational man are too low to reach, too narrow to receive these Joys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be thus, how can any man have these <hi>Joys,</hi> or have any <hi>sense</hi> of
of them, while he is on the <hi>Earth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer to that by <hi>Two places of Scripture.</hi> 1. The <hi>First place of
Scripture</hi> is, 2 Corin. 4. 7. <hi>We have this Treasure in Earthly Vessels, that the
Excellency of the Power may be of God, and not of us.</hi> The <hi>Spiritual man</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth
the Treasure of Spiritual Joys in itself. But the <hi>Natural man</hi> holdeth
in itself this <hi>Joy;</hi> because it holdeth the <hi>Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itual man in itself, as the Water</hi> of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49838:67"/>
life in a <hi>Vessel.</hi> So the Excellency of the Power, which takes in Spiritual Joy,
is <hi>of</hi> the Spiritual man, though it be <hi>in</hi> the Natural man, who is united with
the Spiritual man <hi>in One Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Second</hi> Place of <hi>Scripture</hi> is, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. last. We as in a Glass be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the Glory of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Natural man</hi> is the <hi>Glass,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual
man</hi> is the living <hi>Face.</hi> As a living Face makes an Image of itself in a Glass,
and then sees, enjoys itself in that Image. So the Spiritual man makes an Image
of its Joys in the Natural man; and hath a living, substantial Enjoyment of
them that way: while the Natural man holds the Image only. After the same
manner the Soul in the Body contemplates, enjoys itself, and all immaterial things,
in the imagination only, which is a Material Glass.</p>
            <p>Examine your Joys; do they admit a Stranger, the outward man into their
Fellowship, to intermeddle with them? Do they flow alike thorow the <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
and the <hi>Unregenerate</hi> part, as upon a Level? I would then question, though
I would not condemn them.</p>
            <p>Those Spiritual Joys have the greatest Doubtfulness, and Danger in them,
which make the greatest Impressions, Motions, and Discoveries of themselves
in the Natural man.</p>
            <p>St. Paul speaketh of the Spirits putting up from the Heart of a Saint, <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible
Groans, Rom.</hi> 8. Those Griefs, and Joys are most likely to come
from the Spirit, which make the least Sound, Noise, or Alteration in the Flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
part.</p>
            <p>I have done with this <hi>Use of Examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use. 2. Conviction.</hi> Do not think Religion, or Holiness a <hi>Melancholy thing.</hi>
Do not fear to be Religious, as if then you must part with all your Delights,
and put your self into the perpetual <hi>Desert</hi> of a solitary, sad sour Conversation.
Holiness, and Religion have their <hi>own Joy,</hi> and will take none of <hi>yours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6. Godliness is great gain with Contentment. <hi>Let me commend</hi>
Holiness <hi>to you in</hi> Three Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. Particular. <hi>The</hi> First Particular <hi>is this:</hi> Holiness is a Kingdom in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
<hi>It is</hi> Godliness, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Right way of</hi> taking in, <hi>and</hi> holding forth the
<hi>Majesty of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holiness, is the</hi> Uniting <hi>of the Soul, by a</hi> vital, <hi>and</hi> conjugal <hi>Union to God,
who is the</hi> Lord of All, <hi>who is</hi> All in All. Thy Maker is thy Husband. Es. 54. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion is a Discovery</hi> in the Soul, of God, as the <hi>Eternal Spirit, the Quickning
Spirit;</hi> as bringing forth Himself, as working his own works, as fulfilling his
Joy, as setting up his Kingdom in the Soul. <hi>He hath shined into our Hearts the
Glory of the Knowledge of God, 2 Corin.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Religion is a Drawing</hi> of the Soul up to God, into the Glory of God: as
<hi>the Sheet,</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> saw, was drawn up into Heaven. <hi>Brethren, partakers
of the Heavenly Call, Heb.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
            <p>Can this be a <hi>Melancholy</hi> thing, where there is so much of Heaven, so much
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49838:68"/>
of the Love, Life, Glory of God himself? Can there want Content, where
there is a Kingdom, the Kingdom of God? Or Delights, where the Immortal
King Jesus Christ keeps his Court?</p>
            <p>Why shouldst thou think it strange, when all things in Nature are united to
their Head, and in that have their Perfection; that thy Soul should be re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to her God, and partake of his Fulness, and there possess a Fulness of Joy?
<hi>Thou art our Father:</hi> Say they in the Prophet, <hi>I will return to my Father;</hi> saith
the <hi>Prodigal Son, Luke</hi> 15. 18.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Particular: Godliness, or true Religion is Gain.</hi> It is so far from making
you loosers in any point; that it gives you your own again with Usury and
Increase. It will not divorce your Spirit from any of your Joys; but it will
make the Marriage-bed of your Delights, <hi>Honourable,</hi> and <hi>Undefiled: Green,</hi>
and <hi>Flourishing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a <hi>double Gain</hi> of Joy in Holiness.</p>
            <p>1. There is a <hi>Gainful Change</hi> made upon your Joys, when you come to be
truly Religious. Your former Joys are transfigured like the Garments of Jesus
Christ. They are changed from a <hi>Vile</hi> to a <hi>Glori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> State, from a <hi>Corruptible</hi> to
an <hi>Immortal</hi> State.</p>
            <p>2. There is a <hi>Gainful Addition</hi> made to your Joys, by being Holy. Holiness
brings in upon your Spirits higher, greater, and more Heavenly Joys, such as
you were never acquainted with before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Godliness hath the Promises of this Life, and that, which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim.
4. 8. Gen. 49. 2 6. <hi>Jacob</hi> blesseth his Son <hi>Joseph</hi> after this manner: <hi>The
Almighty shall bless thee with the Blessings of Heaven above, and with the Blessings
of the Deep, that lieth under.</hi> v. 27. He adds: <hi>The Blessings of thy Father hath
prevailed above the Blessings of my Progenitors.</hi> Come, taste, and see, what
Sweetness, what a Blessing there is in being <hi>Holy.</hi> The Blessing of a Holy and
Spiritual <hi>Principle</hi> in your Hearts will prevail above the Blessings, and Joys of
all your Natural, and Worldly <hi>Principles.</hi> You shall have the Delights of
<hi>Heaven</hi> above, and the Delights that are in the <hi>Deep</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> which lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
            <p>All these you shall enjoy, while you are on Earth; 'tis true indeed you shall
enjoy them in the Promises, which is, as a <hi>Spring</hi> in the Earth; which is by
the Life of Faith as under a vail of Contradiction; in a hidden way; but a
sweet, sure, substantial way.</p>
            <p>Do not thou <hi>Doubt,</hi> but that God can make <hi>Abrahams</hi> dead Body a Father
to an <hi>Isaac;</hi> even <hi>thee</hi> in this Earthly State, which is dark, and dead to possess,
as thine own all mirth of Angels, men; all the Precious things of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and
<hi>Moon,</hi> the Creature, and the Creator, if thou put thy trust in him.</p>
            <p>Do not <hi>fear</hi> to give up, and Sacrifice thy <hi>Isaac,</hi> thy Natural Joys to thy God,
by devoting thy self to Him in a Religious way. It shall be no loss or Death
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49838:68"/>
to thy Joys. He shall give thee thy <hi>Isaac,</hi> thy Joys again, in the <hi>Figure,</hi> and
<hi>Fellowship,</hi> as a <hi>Seed</hi> of Eternal Joys.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Particular: Religion gives you Joy with Contentment;</hi> with Assurance,
and Rest. When you come to God, and have your Joys in him, you are at
home, at your End, in your Center: So all the Workings, Desires, Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of your Soul are satisfied, they acquiesce, and are still.</p>
            <p>God is your <hi>Beginning,</hi> and your <hi>End:</hi> When you live to him, he gives you
assurance in your <hi>Joys,</hi> he seals them to you; because he is the <hi>Beginning,</hi> the
first of all. He gives you <hi>Rest</hi> in your Joys, that you care for, you are capable
of nothing more; because he is the <hi>End,</hi> the close, the fulness of all.</p>
            <p>Happy, and Blessed is he, to whom the Kingdom of God is come: God
giveth that man <hi>Joy,</hi> and no trouble; no Stain, no Shame, no Sting with it.</p>
            <p>Happy, and Blessed is he, who hath share in this <hi>Joy,</hi> for to him the Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Death, and every evil is already past.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Part: Enlargement.</hi> The <hi>Enlargement</hi> of the Soul in God is the <hi>Second
Part</hi> of Spiritual <hi>Joy.</hi> This is fitly exprest by the <hi>Prophet.</hi> Esa. 52. 9. <hi>Break
forth into Joy, Sing together, ye wast places of Jerusalem: For the Lord hath
comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</hi> The Lord first <hi>Redeems</hi> the
Soul, delivers her from the State of Servitude, and Subjection; then she <hi>breaks
forth into Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Natural</hi> Joy is the Dilatation, or Enlargement of the <hi>Heart.</hi> Spiritual Joy
is the Dilatation, or Enlargement of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in man. When the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Principle in the Soul breaks out of the Darkness of our Nature, when it
breaks forth from the Bonds of Flesh into its own Liberty, and Freedom: this
is the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and the <hi>Joy</hi> thereof in the Soul.</p>
            <p>You have this <hi>Joy</hi> of the Kingdom fitly, and fully described in a <hi>Parable,</hi>
by our Lord Jesus: <hi>Mat. 13. 44. The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a
Treasure hid in a Field: the which, when a man hath found, he hideth, and for
Joy thereof goeth, and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that Field.</hi> The opening
of this Parable will tend very much to the Explaining of this <hi>Particular,</hi> of
which I am now speaking.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Five Things</hi> to be opened in the <hi>Parable.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The <hi>Field.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The <hi>Treasure</hi> in the Field.</item>
               <item>3. The <hi>Concealment</hi> of this Treasure.</item>
               <item>4. The <hi>Discovery</hi> of the Treasure.</item>
               <item>5. The <hi>Purchase</hi> of the Field.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. The <hi>Field.</hi> This is the First Thing. <hi>The Kingdom of God is like unto
a Treasure hid in a Field.</hi> What should this <hi>Field</hi> be? Can it be any other
thing, than the <hi>Natural Image of God</hi> in Man? This is that in which the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Image</hi> lies hid, as the <hi>Substance</hi> in the <hi>Shadow,</hi> as the <hi>Child</hi> in the <hi>Mother,</hi>
as the <hi>Seed</hi> in the <hi>Field.</hi> This is that, which is not quite <hi>hid,</hi> but is quite <hi>lost</hi>
in us; and to be recovered, and re purchased by an Exchange of our <hi>Selves,</hi>
and all that <hi>we have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Sea</hi> in the Creation expresseth the <hi>Darkness</hi> of the Creature: So the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49838:69"/>
               <hi>Earth</hi> represents the Contrary <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and Beauty in the Creature,
which stands up out of that Darkness: <hi>He hath founded it upon, (or above)
the Waters: Psal.</hi> 24. 2. God hath given to the <hi>Earth,</hi> a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Strength,</hi>
and <hi>Eminency,</hi> by which it appears <hi>out of,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> the <hi>Darkness,</hi> Therefore
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> adds in the same place: <hi>He,</hi> (that is, God) <hi>hath established it,</hi>
(that is, prepared, adorned, and fixed it, he hath put a Beauty and Strength in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it) <hi>above the Floods,</hi> (that is, all Dark, confused, and wandring Principles.)
Then he goes on. v. 3. <hi>Who shall go up into the Holy Hill?</hi> (that is, out of
the <hi>Waters</hi> of the <hi>Darkness</hi> of the Creature, which now have over-flown all,
into this <hi>Hill,</hi> this <hi>Habitable Earth,</hi> which is above the <hi>Waters;</hi> the <hi>Principle</hi> of
Beauty in the Creature, as it is in its <hi>Flower.)</hi> This is the <hi>Earth,</hi> of <hi>which
Christ</hi> speaks in a <hi>Parable,</hi> Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. 28. <hi>The Earth of its own accord sends forth
the Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Field</hi> now is the <hi>Natural Image of God</hi> springing up out of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
of Light in the Creature, and clothing that with itself; as a <hi>Field</hi> doth
the <hi>Earth.</hi> This <hi>Field</hi> in its Flourishing State was the <hi>Garden of Eden, or Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
which Paradise, though <hi>outwardly,</hi> and in the letter, it was a real <hi>Garden</hi>
yet was it also, and principally <hi>Inward,</hi> and in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Natural Image
of God shining forth with a peculiar Glory upon the Beauty of the Creature.</p>
            <p>It is very observable, that <hi>Adam,</hi> when he fell, was cast out of the <hi>Garden,</hi>
out of <hi>Paradise only: Gen. 3. 23. Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from
the Garden of Eden.</hi> But <hi>Cain,</hi> when he had killed his Brother, was cast off
from the <hi>Face of the Earth,</hi> For so he complains, <hi>Gen. 4. 14. Behold I am
driven away from the Face of the Earth, and from thy Face shall I be hid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Face of the Earth,</hi> the <hi>Field,</hi> which is the Natural
Image of God; the <hi>Garden,</hi> which is the Glory of the <hi>Field,</hi> the <hi>Face of God</hi>
in this Image.</p>
            <p>Man fallen from God in <hi>Adam</hi> is banished out of the <hi>Garden.</hi> He hath lost
the pleasant, and glorious Appearances of God in him, by the <hi>Natural Image.</hi>
Yet he hath the <hi>Field</hi> left in him still, the <hi>Natural Image</hi> itself: which though
it be beset, over-grown, shut up with Bryers, and Thorns from the Earth, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
cares, miseries from the Image of the Creature; yet it affords us some
low, weak Strength, and Sweetness for man to feed upon. So you shall read,
<hi>Gen. 3. 18. Bryars, and Thorns shall it bring forth to thee, (that is, the Ground)
and thou shalt eat the Herb of the Field.</hi> Though thou, O man seest no more
the <hi>Trees of the Garden,</hi> the high Appearances of God in the Glory of his
Image; yet thou-shalt have the <hi>Herb</hi> of the <hi>Field</hi> still left thee.</p>
            <p>Man, like <hi>Cain</hi> falling into the depth of Sin, murthering in <hi>Abel,</hi> the Image
of God remaining in him, hath a Darkness brought upon him, which takes
away from him, all the Discoveries of God, with every thing of the Beauty,
and Sweetness of his Image. He also hath withdrawn from him all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
Chearfulness, Vigour, and Life of the <hi>Light-Principle</hi> in the Creature.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49838:69"/>
Though that <hi>Light-Principle</hi> remains still in him, yet he is restless in it, and as a
Stranger to it, rejected by it. Thus <hi>he is driven from the Face of the Earth, he
is hid from the Face of God, he is a Vagabond in the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We see now, what the <hi>Field is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Treasure.</hi> This is the <hi>Second Thing</hi> in the <hi>Parable,</hi> the <hi>Treasure</hi> hid
in the Field. This is <hi>Jesus Christ, Eph. 3. 8. Paul</hi> saith of himself, that he
was <hi>to make known among the Gentiles, the Unsearchable Riches of Christ.</hi> Jesus
Christ is the <hi>Treasure</hi> of <hi>Unsearchable Riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord is the <hi>Seed,</hi> in which all the Vertue, or Powers of God, or the
Creature lie wrapt up. He is the <hi>Root,</hi> which bears the variety of all Divine,
and Humane Excellencies.</p>
            <p>Coloss. 1. 29. It pleased, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> that all Fulness should dwell in him:
<hi>namely, in Jesus Christ, as in its</hi> Principle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 9. All the Fulness of the God-Head dwelleth in him Bodily: that
is, <hi>fully, flourishingly,</hi> shot forth into all its distinct Branches, and Fruits.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Jesus</hi> the Treasure of Heaven lies hid in the Natural Image of God
in Man, as the <hi>Seed lies</hi> hid in the <hi>Field,</hi> or as the <hi>Plant</hi> lies hid in its <hi>Seed,</hi> or
as the <hi>New Creation lies</hi> hid in the <hi>First Creation.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, the
<hi>Mystery</hi> of the Gospel <hi>was hid from the Beginning of the World, Ephes.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ is called the Seed of the Woman in this sense. As <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
is to <hi>God,</hi> his Image, in which he beholds himself: So the <hi>Woman</hi> was to be to
the <hi>Man,</hi> who was made in the Image of God. She was to be, as that <hi>Image
of God,</hi> drawn forth from <hi>Man,</hi> set continually before the Man, that he might
bring forth Children in that Image.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23. It is said: <hi>Adam</hi> called her name <hi>Woman, because she was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of Man.</hi> Woman in <hi>Hebrew</hi> is <hi>Ishah,</hi> Which is the Name of <hi>God,</hi> and
the Name of <hi>Man,</hi> joyned in one, to signify, that the <hi>Woman</hi> was as the Image
of God in Nature, sprung forth from Man, and united to him.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ is the <hi>Seed</hi> of this <hi>Woman,</hi> the Natural Image of God in the
Creature. This is the <hi>Treasure</hi> in this <hi>Field,</hi> as in a Womb.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Concealment.</hi> The <hi>Third Thing</hi> is the <hi>Concealment</hi> of this Treasure.
There is a great deal of difference between the State of <hi>Innocency</hi> in Nature;
and the State of <hi>Grace</hi> in <hi>Christ.</hi> The <hi>First Adam</hi> had only the <hi>Natural Image</hi> of
God appearing and flourishing in him. But a <hi>Saint</hi> under the Gospel hath the
Lord Jesus revealed in him, who is the Super-natural, and Heavenly Image,
which lay undiscovered in the Perfection of Nature, and did not as yet put
forth itself thorow that Inferiour Appearance of God in the first Creation.</p>
            <p>The Scripture tells us of <hi>Two Paradises:</hi> an <hi>Earthly,</hi> and a <hi>Heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Glory of Nature before the Fall, was but an</hi> Earthly <hi>Paradise,</hi> Gen.
2. 9. God planted a Garden Eastward in Eden. And out of the Ground the Lord
God made to grow every Plant, that was pleasant, &amp;c. <hi>Here you have a</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
<hi>made to grow up out of the</hi> Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:49838:70"/>
The Glory of the Gospel in Christ, to which a Saint is to be advanced is a
<hi>Heavenly Paradise,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 2. <hi>I knew a man,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, caught up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Third Heavens.</hi> v. 4. <hi>caught up into Paradise.</hi> Here you have a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
<hi>in,</hi> or <hi>above</hi> the Third Heavens.</p>
            <p>We read, that the most Holy place was not yet opened while the <hi>First Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle</hi>
stood: <hi>Heb. 9. 8. The way into the most Holy place was not yet made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
while the First Tabernacle was standing.</hi> So the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Paradise was not
discovered, while the <hi>Earthly</hi> Paradise flourished in the Creature, but there was
a vail between them. Jesus Christ lay hid in the Image of the Earthly man.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Treasure</hi> was <hi>hid</hi> in the <hi>Field, before</hi> the Fall of Man.</p>
            <p>But <hi>by</hi> the Fall, the Field itself was lost. The Natural Image of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,
and disappeared in all the <hi>Glory</hi> of it, when man sinned. So far, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained;
it remains captived, imprisoned by the Devil, under Darkness, Lusts,
monstrous Images, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23. Sinful men are said to <hi>change the Glory of
the incorruptible God</hi> (in the Natural Image) <hi>into the Image of a Corruptible
Man, of four-footed Beasts,</hi> &amp;c. The Fall of Man brought in this Corruptible
Image in which Man, and all the Creatures now are, which detains the Image
of God, as a Prisoner in itself.</p>
            <p>Thus now the <hi>Treasure</hi> is doubly <hi>hid,</hi> in the <hi>Field,</hi> and in the <hi>Bryars,</hi> which
over-grow, and hide the <hi>Field</hi> itself.</p>
            <p>4. Discovery: Which, when a man finds, <hi>saith Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Jesus Christ was to come in the Flesh, he sent <hi>John</hi> Baptist to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
his way.</hi> This <hi>Preparation</hi> was to be made by a <hi>restoring</hi> of the Divine
Image in Nature, which is the <hi>First Restitution</hi> of all things, that was to be
made by <hi>Eliah;</hi> and this <hi>Eliah</hi> was <hi>John</hi> the Baptist. He was also <hi>to point out
Jesus Christ;</hi> to shew how he was figured out in that First Image, and now
ready to break forth thorow this Image.</p>
            <p>So, when the Season comes in the Soul, Jesus Christ, the Eternal Image puts
up the Natural Image of God in the Soul; and puts forth himself thorow it: as
the Seed of Corn first comes up in the tender Blade, like a low <hi>Herb,</hi> an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Grass before it comes forth into the shape of <hi>Corn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Redemption, and the Discovery begins in the Soul, which makes way
for the <hi>Joy</hi> of the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>Purchase. He hides it, and goes with joy. and sells all that he hath,
and buys this Field.</hi> Here the Purchase of the <hi>Field</hi> for the <hi>Treasures</hi> sake is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest.
About this the Soul goes with Joy.</p>
            <p>But what means this <hi>Second Concealment?</hi> This <hi>Hiding</hi> of the Treasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
after that it is once found? This <hi>Hiding</hi> of it is, the <hi>laying it up</hi> in a
Mans Heart: The hiding of it in a Mans inward Spirit; and the hiding of a
mans self in it, according to his Inward Spirit. A man now draws this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Glory out of that Fleshly Darkness, under which it lay, into his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Principle;</hi> and withdraws his inward Principle out of the Flesh, and
the Lusts of it into this Treasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:49838:70"/>
Then a Man for the love of this Treasure, and in the Strength of it, sells
all that <hi>he hath,</hi> casts away his Corruptions, the Creatures, his own Being, as
they are <hi>his own,</hi> as he hath them <hi>in himself,</hi> that he may have his own Being,
and all the Creatures, in the Natural Image of God; and that Image, in Jesus
Christ: And this the Soul doth with Joy. For this is that <hi>Enlargement,</hi> that
<hi>Liberty,</hi> which is the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> and the <hi>Joy</hi> thereof in the Soul.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>First Image</hi> of God is brought out of its Prison; now Jesus Christ
is brought out of his hidden, streightned State to Freedom in the Soul. Now
those Discoveries of God, which lay shut up in Jesus Christ, as in a Seed, thrust
forth themselves into Liberty in the Spirit of Man. The Spirit of a man is
brought forth from the darkness, narrowness of Lusts, and the Flesh, into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of these divine Appearances, into the Spirit of the Lord Jesus, where
the Spirit of man is in a Depth, Height, Breadth, Length, without any Limit,
or Confinement. This <hi>Liberty</hi> is the <hi>Divine Joy</hi> of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will conclude this</hi> Particular <hi>with that place of Scripture, Psal.</hi> 96. 12.
Let the Field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the Trees of the
Wood Rejoyce.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Psalm</hi> is a <hi>Prophesy</hi> of the State, and times of the Gospel, as appears
by the <hi>First Verse,</hi> which calls this <hi>Psalm</hi> a <hi>New Song.</hi> This is the Name, by
which the Gospel is frequently expressed in Scripture. The Sense then of this
<hi>Psalm</hi> is chiefly Spiritual.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Verse</hi> before this <hi>Twelfth Verse</hi> we read thus. v. 11. <hi>Let the Heavens
rejoyce, and let the Earth be glad, let the Sea r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Natural Image of God, as it is above the Creature, and the Head of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is the <hi>Heavens:</hi> The <hi>Earth,</hi> the Light-part: the <hi>Sea,</hi> the Dark part;
which both make <hi>One Creature,</hi> as Earth, and Sea make <hi>One Globe.</hi> Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.
v. 12. <hi>Let the Field rejoyce.</hi> The <hi>Field</hi> is the Image of God, as it grows
up out of the Creature, and is the Life of that.</p>
            <p>While a man is in a Sinful State, the <hi>Field</hi> languisheth; the Vertues, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
of God are withdrawn, and hid in it. But when a man is <hi>New-born,</hi>
then this <hi>Field</hi> rejoyceth, and breaks forth into <hi>Singing.</hi> The Discoveries of
God grow up high, full, and thick, as <hi>Trees</hi> of the Wood, and <hi>Sing</hi> together
in the Soul; which is now at <hi>Liberty,</hi> and in <hi>Joy,</hi> in the midst of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Three Things</hi> go to make up the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Man.</hi> To be a <hi>Man</hi> is,

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. To be a Man, is to be the Image of another. Gen. 1. 26. <hi>God made
Man</hi> in an Image, in a Likeness. <hi>He that is a</hi> Man <hi>is to have no</hi> Principle, Form,
Activity, Appearance <hi>of his own. But in all he is to answer the</hi> Principle, Forms,
Actings, Appearances <hi>of another, in that manner, of which</hi> Solomon <hi>speaks,</hi>
Prov. 27. 19. As in the Water, Face answers Face: so is the Heart of Man.
<hi>Man in this Creation is the</hi> Face <hi>in the</hi> Water, <hi>which answers to another</hi> Face
<hi>above the</hi> Water.</p>
            <p>All Creatures are <hi>Representations. Man,</hi> the chief Creature is the chief <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation.</hi>
The Philosopher called Man,<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a Creature made for
<hi>Imitation;</hi> to hold forth something <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>above</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>First Adam</hi> a <hi>Figure</hi> or <hi>Type: Rom.</hi> 5. 14. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in
one place tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he transferred things to himself, and to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollos,</hi>
as in a <hi>Type,</hi> or <hi>Figure,</hi> for their sakes. Man is to possess his Being, and all
things, that appertain to it, <hi>as in a Figure,</hi> as a <hi>Type</hi> of some higher thing.</p>
            <p>With what Humility, and Peace? In what Silence, and Satisfaction would
Man live, if he did but know himself; that he <hi>walkt in a Figure;</hi> that his
whole <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> is altogether a <hi>Figure</hi> of something above him, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to come, which is to be revealed in him?</p>
            <p>What would become of all our Pride, Plots, Passions; if we knew; that
Man is as the <hi>Reflection</hi> of the Light of the Sun from a Glass upon a wall.
That <hi>reflection,</hi> that Light upon the wall <hi>danceth,</hi> and <hi>trembleth,</hi> as the Glass
moveth, from which it is cast? The <hi>Sun</hi> is God: the <hi>Light Jesus Christ:</hi> the
<hi>Glass,</hi> the <hi>Angelical Nature:</hi> the <hi>Reflection,</hi> or Light on the Wall, the <hi>Earthly
Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Thing</hi> in the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To be a Man, is to be the Image of God, Gen. 1. 26. <hi>God made man</hi>
in his own Image, and Likeness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. The First Man was the Figure
of him, who was to come: <hi>that is, of Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Man is the <hi>Supream,</hi> and <hi>Universal</hi> Image of God in the <hi>First Creation;</hi> as
Jesus Christ is in the <hi>Second,</hi> Eccles: 6. 10. <hi>That which hath been, it is named
already, that it is man: and he may not contend with him, who is mightier than
he. Man is all</hi> in this <hi>First Creation</hi> which is that, which hath been already,
and is now faded, passing away, but this <hi>Man</hi> must yield to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who
is coming, and bringing with him a New Creation.</p>
            <p>So far thou art a <hi>Man,</hi> as thou comprehendest, sustainest, subduest, possessest
enjoyest all Images of things among the <hi>Creatures, in thy self,</hi> as the <hi>Universal
Image;</hi> and <hi>thy self</hi> as an <hi>Image,</hi> in the <hi>Appearance of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He indeed is a <hi>Man,</hi> and lives, as the <hi>Image</hi> of God, who lives at a Height
above the Creatures <hi>in himself;</hi> and at a Height above himself, <hi>in God.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:49838:71"/>
That, by which we see a Building, a Wood, a large Prospect, or the Body
of Heaven, is a very <hi>little thing,</hi> and lies in a little compass in the <hi>Apple</hi> of the
Eye, as <hi>one</hi> with it. But it shews not the Eye, to the Eye; nor itself to the Eye;
but only those things, which it represents. Man is the great <hi>Representative</hi> of
God. He ceaseth to be a <hi>Man,</hi> so far, as he sees any thing, besides <hi>himself,</hi> in
the Creatures; and any thing besides <hi>God,</hi> in himself.</p>
            <p>As God in Divine things: so Man, as the Image of God in Natural things,
is to be <hi>All in All.</hi> This is the <hi>Natural Righteousness,</hi> and Perfection of Man,
thus to stand in the Image of God.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Second Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>To be a Man, is to be the Image only, and no more. David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.
6. <hi>Man walks in a vain show:</hi> an empty Image. And least you should think,
that this is spoken of Man only since his Fall: when man was first made in a
State of Perfection, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 26. it is said, that <hi>God made man in his own
Image, and Likeness:</hi> the very same word is used there by <hi>Moses,</hi> which is used
here by <hi>David:</hi> TSELEM. The Word signifies a <hi>Dying Shadow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Man is only a <hi>Shadow</hi> of God without the <hi>Substance:</hi> a <hi>Shadowy</hi> Image,
not a <hi>Substantial</hi> one; an <hi>Image,</hi> which subsists by the <hi>Substance,</hi> and hath the
<hi>Likeness</hi> of it: but possesseth not the <hi>Substance</hi> with the <hi>Life</hi> in itself.</p>
            <p>The Difference between <hi>Man,</hi> as he was created at first, and the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi>
is expressed by <hi>St. Paul,</hi> 1 Corin. 15. 49. <hi>As we have born the Image of
the Earthly, so shall we bear the Image of the Heavenly also.</hi> Man is an <hi>Earthly
Image:</hi> Jesus Christ is the <hi>Heavenly Image</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Earth</hi> is an Image of Heaven in a baser Substance, or Kind, <hi>Man</hi> is an
<hi>Image</hi> of God in a Principle of Darkness, which hides, and vails the <hi>Substance.</hi>
Jesus Christ is a <hi>Perfect Image,</hi> which holds forth the <hi>Substance</hi> clearly, and is
<hi>One</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus</hi> Man at his best Estate is altogether Vanity, <hi>as</hi> David <hi>speaks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So we have seen, <hi>what Man is:</hi> by which we see, from whence we are
fallen: How little of <hi>Man</hi> there is left in <hi>Man.</hi> When Man was perfect, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
Submission, Obedience was the Perfection of man, as being an Image
only. What little reason then hath empty, wretched man <hi>now</hi> for Pride, Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
Confidence, Self-love?</p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>First Instruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Instr. What a Sinner is.</hi> A Sinner <hi>un-mans</hi> himself. He puts himself out
of the Image of God into some low, inferiour Image of a Creature. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of sinful men, <hi>Psal. 4. 2. How long will ye turn my Glory into Shame?</hi>
Man is the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> Saith <hi>St. Paul;</hi> that is, the Image of God. Man by
by Sin exchangeth this Glorious Image for some base Image among the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which becomes an Idol, and a Reproach, when it is not held in the Image
of God, as in its Head. Thus Man <hi>turns the Glory of God into Shame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O! That we did understand, how Glorious an Image <hi>Man</hi> is by his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49838:72"/>
what a change <hi>Sin</hi> hath made in him! We should then hate <hi>Sin</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and tremble at every Act of it.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Sinner</hi> is <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Ape of a Man,</hi> and not a <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. A Monster.</item>
                  <item>3. A Devil.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>A Sinner is the Ape of a Man,</hi> and not a <hi>Man:</hi> He is a Beast in the
Likeness of a Man: or the Image of Man shut up, and imprisoned in a Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Principle, and Image.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psal. 49. 12. Man being in Honour continueth not, but becomes like the Beast
that perisheth.</hi> By each act of Lust, Passion, any inordinate Inclination toward
any Created Appearance, thou un-clothest thy self of the Image of God,
which is <hi>thine Honour,</hi> and clothest thy self with a Particular Image, which, if
it be without Life, is a Stock, or a Stone, if it have Life is a Beast; So, whil'st
thou livest in it, thou art but the <hi>Ape</hi> of a Man, and a true Beast; putting on
contempt, scorn, and Death; instead of Honour, and Immortality.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>A Sinner is a Monster.</hi> When thou sinnest, thou confoundest the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Image</hi> in thee with a <hi>base Image,</hi> so thou makest thy self a <hi>Monster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen. 6. 2. The Sons of God saw the Daughters of men, and took Wives of
them.</hi> Then at the fourth v. we read; that <hi>there were Gyants upon the Earth
in those days.</hi> Give me leave to make an <hi>Allegory,</hi> or an <hi>Allusion</hi> of this Story,
which you please.</p>
            <p>The Divine Image is the Man, the <hi>Son of God:</hi> All the Inferiour Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Creatures descend from this, depend on this, are the <hi>Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary,</hi>
and <hi>weaker Births</hi> of it. So they are the <hi>Daughters of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Image of God in Man holds the lower Images of things in a
<hi>Subjection,</hi> and <hi>subordination</hi> to itself, as <hi>Daughters</hi> to their <hi>Father:</hi> all things
then are in their Order, and Beauty.</p>
            <p>But when the <hi>Son of God,</hi> the Supream Image, which is Man, looks down,
and dotes upon the Inferiour Images the <hi>Daughters of Men;</hi> when it marries,
and mingles itself with them, then confusion comes in: then this Beautiful
Image, <hi>Man,</hi> becomes a <hi>Monster,</hi> and brings forth Monsters.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Gyants are born:</hi> Man comes forth in a greatness, and force resembling
the Image of God in Man, but is in the true Form, and Principle of a Beast.
The Divine Image is fallen, imprisoned, dead in the midst of all this Greatness.</p>
            <p>Thus of a truth <hi>Sin</hi> is the highest Incest, the most unnatural confusion, the
true Engendring of Monsters.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>A Sinner makes himself a Devil.</hi> A man by Sin withdraws the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the Image of God: sets it up in its own Principle, and Image: so
maintains it in the place of, and against the Image of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 25. St. Paul sets forth the Nature of Sin after this manner. <hi>who
changed the Truth of God into a Lie, serving the Creature more than the Creator,
who is blessed for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> See here the nature of the <hi>Devil</hi> discovered in a <hi>Sinner.</hi>

When thou fatherest any Sin, thou by that Act makest thy self the Father
of <hi>Idolatry, Lies,</hi> and <hi>Murther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Thou</hi> makest thy self by Sin the <hi>Father of Idolatries:</hi> Thou settest up
the Creature above the Creator, and servest that, more than thou dost him;
Sacrificing thy Heart, thy Love, and thy Life to it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Thou</hi> makest thy self by Sin the <hi>Father of Lies:</hi> thou settest up the
Creature; as if it were something <hi>of,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> itself; when as it is meerly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
save as it is <hi>in</hi> the Image of God.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thou</hi> makest thy self by Sin the <hi>Father of Murthers:</hi> Thou killest, and

of all Murthers. Thou <hi>changest the Truth of God into a Lie.</hi> Thou makest
away that Image of God, which is the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of all the Creatures;
by setting up instead of it those things, which as they are in themselves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that Image, are not only <hi>Vanity,</hi> but a <hi>Lie</hi> too.</p>
            <p>He knows very little of the Nature of <hi>Man,</hi> of the <hi>Creature,</hi> of God; who
knows not <hi>Sin</hi> to be the most ridiculous <hi>Apishness,</hi> that he may <hi>despise</hi> it: the
most horrid <hi>Monstrousness,</hi> that he may <hi>hate</hi> it: the highest <hi>Devilishness,</hi> that
he may <hi>tremble</hi> at it, and fly from it.</p>
            <p>So much for the Second Instruction, which shews us, <hi>what a Sinner is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Instr. What a Saint is.</hi> Then a Man begins to be a Saint, when the
<hi>Natural Image</hi> of God begins to be restored in him with advantage; with the
advantage of the <hi>Super-natural Image</hi> bringing it forth again <hi>from</hi> itself, and
itself <hi>in</hi> it, together <hi>with</hi> it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> brings forth itself, and the <hi>Kingdom of Nature</hi> a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time in itself. <hi>Behold, I make all things new,</hi> Saith <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> when he
appears in the Soul.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Adam</hi> revives, and restores the <hi>First Adam,</hi> in us; but as in its
own Spirit, and Bosom; that so the <hi>Earthly</hi> Man may become <hi>Heavenly,</hi> and
Immortal.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this use with <hi>Consolation</hi> to <hi>Two Sorts</hi> of Mourners, <hi>Gods
Mourners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Consolation.</hi> You who have lost the Innocency of your Natures in Sin, and
Guilt; be you comforted in the knowledge of this: The Righteousness of God,
the Eternal Image of Glory shall break forth in your Souls, and bring forth
the First Image of Beauty, your Natural Innocency again upon you; with an
Increase of Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the Lord that justifies, who shall condemn:</hi> Saith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. 34.
Who, or what Guilt shall condemn thee, or be able to sink for ever the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and Beauty of thy Nature; though it now have lain long buried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thy Lusts? The Lord, the Lord himself shall come, and this Beauty of
thine shall come with him, and thou shall see it again with Joy.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Consolation.</hi> You, who have lost the Chearfulness of your Spirits, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49838:73"/>
the sweet Pleasantness of your Natural tempers in Melancholy, and Terrours,
comfort your selves in the knowledge of this. The Spring of Joys, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Spirit, the Spirit of our Lord Jesus shall open itself within you; and shall
send forth from itself the ancient streams of your first Peace, and joys; of
your natural chearfulness. Your natural Spirits shall once more danc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and sing
together in this Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All your Springs</hi> are in this Heavenly Image: the Springs of your first Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
Beauty, Peace, Pleasantness. All shall open themselves again upon you
from the Bosom of this Image, at the Appearance of it, never to be shut more.
And this Heavenly Image shall certainly appear in you. Only do you wait
with Hope, and Patience for the appointed Season.</p>
            <p>Do notmourn at the Death of any natural Beauty, or Content, as without
Hope ever to see it again; the Hour comes apace, and perhaps now is, in which
thy dead Innocency, and Joys shall hear the Voice of the Son of Man, Jesus
Christ in thee, and live again by him.</p>
            <p>Do not doubt, but believe. The Earth shall hear the Heaven. The Earthly
Image of Life, Paradise, and Heaven in thee shall be awakened again in thy
Spirit by the manifestation of thy Saviour in thee. Thine Eyes shall see thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;
and he shall stand the last upon the Earth. Thine Eyes shall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see Jesus Christ, when he shall redeem the Earthly Man in thee with all its
Excellency, and Sweetness from these Powers of Sin, Fear, Death, and Hell,
which have carried it captive. And thou shalt see this Jesus the Heaven of God,
the Heavenly Image, last of all standing, and appearing in thy Earth, thy
Earthly Man, thy first Image.</p>
            <p>Be of good chear, faint not. Death shall not prevent this Blessedness. Thou
shalt live, when God shall do all this; thine Eyes shall behold it, and thou shalt
taste of it, and feed upon it. For God hath undertaken it, and he will bring it
to pass. <hi>Behold I make all things new;</hi> saith <hi>He,</hi> who is the <hi>first, and the last.</hi>
Believe, and wait: for <hi>these words are True, and Holy.</hi> Revel. 21. 5, 6. <hi>And
he that sate upon the Throne said: Behold I will make all things new. And he
said, Write,</hi> (write upon your Hearts this Sentence, behold, I the Lord make
all things new.) <hi>For these words are True, and Holy. And he said unto me; It
is done:</hi> (This is the Finishing of all things, the ending of the Mystery) <hi>I
am Alpha, and Omega, the Beginning, and the End: I will give unto him, that
is a thirst, of the Fountain of the Water of Life Freely,</hi> that is, without any
thing of <hi>Suitableness</hi> to it, or <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for it, without any <hi>Condition,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Part: The Activity of the Soul in God. <hi>This is the</hi> Third, <hi>and</hi> last Part
<hi>of</hi> Divine Ioy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Psalmist</hi> expresseth <hi>Joy</hi> by <hi>Shouting,</hi> and <hi>Singing:</hi> Psal 65. 13. <hi>The
Pastures are clothed with Flocks;</hi> (the Appearances of God are Green, and
Flourishing, they bring forth, maintain, and put forth themselves into nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49838:73"/>
Flocks of Saints:) <hi>the Valleys also are covered with Corn;</hi> (The lowest
State of things in the Flesh, and the Natural Man are cloathed with Jesus
Christ, and grow up into him, who is the Bread, and Beauty of Eternal life.)
<hi>they Shout for Joy, they also Sing.</hi> This is <hi>Spiritual Musick,</hi> the working of <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Joy,</hi> to <hi>Shout,</hi> and to <hi>Sing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read of a <hi>Two-fold Song,</hi> which Spiritual Persons sing, <hi>Revel. 15. 3.
They Sing the Song of Moses, and of the Lamb.</hi> The <hi>Song of Moses</hi> is the <hi>Law;
the Song of the Lamb, the Gospel.</hi> When the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> had passed
thorow the Red Sea, and saw their Enemies lie dead on the Shore: then they
Sung the Song of <hi>Moses,</hi> who drew them out of those <hi>Waters,</hi> according to
the <hi>Signification</hi> of his <hi>Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Soul hath escaped out of the Sea of <hi>Blood</hi> mingled with <hi>Fire,</hi>
which is the Dissolution of her <hi>Natural Principles</hi> in Troubles, and Terrours
by the <hi>Baptism of the Spirit;</hi> when shee sees her Spiritual Enemies slain on
the <hi>Dry Land</hi> of Christ Spiritual Appearance: then she Sings the <hi>Song of the
Lamb, who was dead, but is alive, and lives for ever;</hi> the Song of Peace.</p>
            <p>Singing <hi>naturally,</hi> with the outward voice, is the highest, and fullest <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi>
of the <hi>Natural Spirits.</hi> So Singing <hi>Spiritually,</hi> and with the Inward Man
is the highest <hi>Activity</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in our <hi>Spiritual Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Spiritual Musick,</hi> or <hi>Singing,</hi> which is the working of the Wine of
<hi>Spiritual Joy</hi> in the Soul, consists of <hi>Three Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Heightning of the Soul towards God.</item>
               <item>2. The Tuning of the Soul to God.</item>
               <item>3. The Exercise, or Entertainment of the Soul upon God, and with God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. The Heightning of the Soul towards God. <hi>This is</hi> one Piece <hi>of that</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
<hi>of</hi> Spiritual Ioy, <hi>which is the</hi> true Musick <hi>of the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that place cited before, <hi>Psal. 65. 13. Singing,</hi> and <hi>Shouting</hi> are put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, 1 <hi>Thessal. 4. 16. The Lord Jesus</hi> is said <hi>to descend from Heaven with a
Shout.</hi> This <hi>Shout</hi> is the <hi>Awakening,</hi> and the <hi>Elevation</hi> of the Soul, or Body
towards the highest State of things, by the <hi>Powerful breakings forth</hi> of the
Glory of God upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psalm, Psal. 57. 7. David</hi> had said: <hi>I will Sing, and give Praise.</hi> Then he calls
upon himself, v. 8. <hi>Awake up my Glory, awake my Psaltery, and Harp: I
my self will awake right early.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some say, <hi>Davids Glory</hi> was his <hi>Tongue:</hi> but then sure it was such a <hi>Tongue
of Fire,</hi> as sat upon the Heads of the Apostles, a <hi>Tongue</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and Heavenly Glory, like a <hi>Flame, enlightning,</hi> and <hi>heating</hi> both at once.</p>
            <p>Man is the Glory of God; <hi>saith</hi> St. Paul, 1 Corin. 11. 7. <hi>The</hi> Spiritual
Man <hi>is the</hi> true, <hi>and</hi> Spiritual <hi>Glory of God. The</hi> Natural Man <hi>is but a</hi> Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy
Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> calls upon his <hi>Glory</hi> to <hi>awake;</hi> as distinct from <hi>himself;</hi> and then he
saith: <hi>I shall awake;</hi> like that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Galat. 2. 20. <hi>I live not, but Christ
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49838:74"/>
in me:</hi> there is the <hi>Glory</hi> awakening itself: <hi>and the Life, that I live, is by the
Faith of the Son of God:</hi> there is <hi>himself</hi> awakened in that Glory.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Soul sings,</hi> when the Life of Jesus Christ, which is her <hi>Glory,
awakens</hi> itself in her, and awakens her together with itself, into the <hi>Light of
God,</hi> to a <hi>Contemplation of,</hi> and <hi>fixing upon</hi> his Beauties. Now the <hi>Soul</hi> is above
her ordinary Pitch, as <hi>Waking</hi> is above <hi>Sleeping.</hi> Now she sits above herself,
upon the top of her <hi>Spiritual Principles,</hi> as a <hi>Bird</hi> upon the <hi>Top-branch</hi> of a
Tree, Singing in the <hi>Sun-shine,</hi> the highest Light of <hi>Divine Discoveries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First thing</hi> in this <hi>Activity,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Musick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Timing of the Soul to God.</hi> In that fore-mentioned <hi>Psal.</hi> 57.
7. <hi>David</hi> speaks of <hi>awakening</hi> three distinct <hi>Lives: His Glory: His Psaltery,
and Harp: Himself.</hi> The <hi>Glory</hi> is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the <hi>Soul. Self</hi> is the <hi>Soul.</hi>
The <hi>Psaltery</hi> and <hi>Harp</hi> those <hi>Heavenly Principles,</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> which as <hi>Minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Spirits,</hi> go forth from Jesus Christ into the Soul, <hi>suiting, fitting,</hi> and <hi>tuning</hi>
the Soul to her Saviour.</p>
            <p>Revel. 15. 2. <hi>St.</hi> Iohn saw the Saints, that had gotten the victory over the
Beast, stand upon a Sea of Glass mingled with Fire, and the Harps of God in their
hands. <hi>Then in the next verse they</hi> Sing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sea</hi> is <hi>this Creation,</hi> especially the <hi>Invisible,</hi> the <hi>Angelical Part</hi> of it. In
this State it is a <hi>dark, troubled, foaming Sea.</hi> But in the Kingdom of Christ it
shall be a <hi>Sea of Glass,</hi> a <hi>Chrystalline Sea,</hi> clear, calm, fresh taking in, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
forth the Lord Jesus, the <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Face</hi> of God, as a <hi>Glass,</hi> as a pleasant
Stream. The <hi>Fire,</hi> with which it shall be mingled, shall be the <hi>Spirit of God,
and of Glory</hi> resting upon the Creature.</p>
            <p>The Saints standing upon this <hi>Sea,</hi> shall have the <hi>Harps of God</hi> in their hands.
<hi>Angels</hi> are the <hi>Trumpets of God.</hi> This State of the Saints, which is here descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
is their <hi>Angelical State,</hi> when they shall be <hi>like the Angels.</hi> These Harps
of God then are <hi>Angelical Tempers,</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> which Jesus Christ brings
forth, and puts into the Soul, <hi>as Harps</hi> into their <hi>Hands,</hi> by which they are tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and fitted, made ready <hi>for Him,</hi> to sing <hi>to Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Soul is <hi>tuned</hi> to God, being put into a Spiritual, and Heavenly
Temper, like an <hi>Angel</hi> beholding the Face of God, and in a readiness to Sing
forth, to Sing aloud his Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coloss.</hi> 3. 16. St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> which they were to Sing
<hi>with Grace in their Hearts.</hi> This is that, which <hi>David</hi> calls <hi>his Harp.</hi> This is
the <hi>Harp of God in the hands</hi> of the Saints, the <hi>Grace of God in their Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Tuning</hi> of the Soul to Christ, the Receiving of <hi>Grace for Grace</hi>
from Christ, the winding up of Grace in the Heart to a pitch of Conformity,
and Communion with Jesus Christ, like the <hi>Tuning</hi> of two voices, or Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
one to another; that so Christ and the Soul may make Musick each to
other, and have their <hi>Joy fulfilled</hi> in one another.</p>
            <p>So much for the <hi>Second Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:49838:74"/>
3. The Exercise, and Entertainment of the Soul upon God, and with God.
<hi>This is the</hi> Third thing <hi>in the Souls</hi> Singing <hi>for</hi> Ioy.</p>
            <p>David <hi>saith in one place:</hi> I will Sing of thy Righteousness: <hi>and in another:</hi>
I will Sing of thy Power.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spiritual Joy,</hi> and <hi>Musick</hi> of a Saint is to fly abroad among the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of the Divine Nature: to enlarge, and act his Spirit to the Height upon
the Beauties, and Brightnesses in the Face of God; the Uprightness, Truth,
Perfection in the Heart of God; the Freedom, Fulness, Fruitfulness, Infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in the Spirit, and Life of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> hath often expressions to this purpose: <hi>I will Sing to thee: I will Sing
to the Lord.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks: <hi>Making melody to God.</hi> The Holy Soul Sings
<hi>of God, to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spiritual Joy</hi> is the <hi>Free letting forth</hi> of the Spirit <hi>with</hi> God, <hi>concerning</hi> God.</p>
            <p>It is often the Work, and Delight of a Holy Soul to open her mouth wide,
to take in to the utmost, the contemplation of God, the communications of his
Greatness, Fulness, Sweetness, Glory: and then, when she is fullest, to pour
forth herself again into the Ear, and Bosom of her God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You may see this in the</hi> Psalmist, Psalm 45. 1. My Heart is enditing a
good matter. I speak of the things touching the King. My Tongue is as the pen of
a ready writer.</p>
            <p>The Heart was here full. A Spring of Heavenly Sweetness had opened itself
in it. It bubled, and boyled up apace. It enlarged itself into a Flood of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But all was <hi>touching the King,</hi> the Beauty, the Glory, the Graciousness,
the Pleasantness, the Love, the Power of Jesus Christ. And the Heart <hi>full</hi> of
this Blessed matter, empties itself again as <hi>fully</hi> upon Jesus Christ. <hi>My Tongue
is as the Pen of a ready Writer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now shewn you the <hi>Third Part</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Joy,</hi> which is the <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the Soul in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Use. 1. For Instruction. Spiritual Ioy <hi>is no</hi> Secure, Slothful, Carnal <hi>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Spiritual Joy is no Secure thing.</hi> It hath the <hi>least,</hi> and the <hi>greatest</hi> Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in it. It suffers a man to be least of all secure in himself, or in any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
that he may be most secure in God.</p>
            <p>True <hi>Joy</hi> consists in the <hi>Heightning of the Soul towards God.</hi> The Soul, that
is acquainted with this Joy, hath a Fear, and Trembling upon her, while she
is among the Creatures, though she be in the Fulness of them. She can rest no
where, till she get up above them all, and come to God.</p>
            <p>God makes a Gracious Promise to a good Man, <hi>Psal. 91. 14. I will s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t
him on high, because he hath known my name.</hi> The word signifies the setting of
a man in a <hi>Strong Castle</hi> situate on a <hi>High Rock.</hi> The God-Head is the <hi>Rock,</hi>
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> or the Humanity of Jesus Christ, is the <hi>Castle</hi> upon this Rock.</p>
            <p>A Holy Soul is in <hi>Safety,</hi> and may be in very great Security; but not in her
self, nor in the World. Her Safety, and Security lies in being carried upward,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49838:75"/>
and set on high, in being encompassed with Jesus Christ, and God, as with a
Tower of Defence.</p>
            <p>The Soul hath her <hi>high Rock,</hi> and her Strong Castle of Spiritual Joy, and
Triumph; not in the knowledge of any thing here below, not in any Earthly
acquaintance; but in the knowledge of God. <hi>I will set him on High, because
he hath known me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we be in the Light, as God is Light; then is our Joy full; and the
consolations of the Lord Jesus cleanse our Hearts from all Clouds of Griefs,
and Fears.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Instruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Spiritual Joy is no Sluggish Thing.</hi> It is the <hi>Enlargement,</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi>
of the Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I went by the Field of the Sluggard,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, end I saw it over-grown
with Thorns.</hi> Thy <hi>Spirit</hi> is thy <hi>Field.</hi> If thou be not <hi>plowing</hi> it up with the
Cross of Christ; and <hi>sowing</hi> it with the Seeds of Grace, Glory, and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
by the Life of Christ; and waiting for, and gathering, and feeding upon
the Appearances of these in thee; thou art this Sluggard, and canst expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Thorns.</p>
            <p>That Soul which is not Spiritually <hi>active</hi> in Christ, will be miserably <hi>passive</hi>
in Cares, and Confusions,</p>
            <p>Divine Joy is the Highest, and most Harmonious Activity of the Soul upon
the highest Excellencies of the Best, and most Blessed Object, which is Jesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>While the Husband-man sleepeth, Tares are Sown. If Jesus Christ be asleep
in the Ship, the Winds toss it, and the Waves fill it. A sleepy, or sluggish tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Spirit breeds Fears, Cares, and all Sorts of Troubles.</p>
            <p>Awaken the Lord Jesus in thy Spirit, and be thy self awake in his Spirit, if
thou wouldst have Peace, and Joy.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Spiritual Joy is no Carnal, or Fleshly Thing.</hi> This is the <hi>Third Instruction.</hi>
The Joy of the Spirit is the <hi>Exercise, and Entertainment of the Soul on God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark the Temper, and Spirit of</hi> St. Iohn, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 3. That, which we
have seen, and heard, declare we unto you, that ye also may have Fellowship with
us; and truly our Fellowship is with the Father, and with the Son Iesus Christ.
<hi>V.</hi> 4. And these things write we unto you, that your Ioy may be full. <hi>V.</hi> 5. This
then is the Message, which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God
is Light, and in him there is no Darkness at all.</p>
            <p>Spiritual <hi>Joy</hi> springs from <hi>seeing</hi> Spiritual Objects, and <hi>hearing</hi> Spiritual My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.
<hi>The Eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the Ear with hearing:</hi> Saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Eccl.</hi> 1. 8. The Natural Eye, and Ear can convey no Satisfaction to us
For they are but a <hi>Dream.</hi> The Sight, and hearing of the Things of <hi>this
Life</hi> can give no Satisfaction; for they are but a <hi>Shadow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Full Joy, Joy,</hi> and fulness both together come by a Spiritual way of seeing,
and hearing the Things of <hi>Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

You may have a <hi>slight, empty, vanishing</hi> Joy <hi>by Fellowship</hi> with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,

            <p>But if you will have a <hi>full,</hi> and <hi>solid</hi> Joy, which may endure for ever, your

            <p>Bring before your Spirits the Excellencies, and, Delights of the whole World.
Let all the Creatures send into your Souls from the <hi>best Hand, Messages</hi> of their

in any of these things. For all the Creatures have in their highest Sweetnesses,

            <p>Would you have Joy? Seek it in the <hi>Declaration</hi> and Discovery of God, <hi>who

            <p>Your Fears, Doubts, and Servile Tempers in your Religion arise from a

            <p>
               <hi>St. Paul</hi> speaks to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> as being <hi>Risen</hi> with Jesus Christ, <hi>Col. 3. 1.
If ye then be Risen with Christ, seek those things, which are above, where Christ
sitteth on the Right Hand of God.</hi>

               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:49838:76"/>
We may come to that Degree of Liberty, Power, Peace, and
Pleasure in Holiness; which may be a <hi>Resurrection</hi> into the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of God,
and Heaven, compared with lower Degrees of Grace, thorow which we pass.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Paul</hi> speaks to the <hi>Galatians: But now after that ye have known God, or
rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak, and beggerly Elements,
whereunto ye desire again to be in Bondage? Galat.</hi> 4. 9. Here you have descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
a <hi>Two fold State of Grace</hi> on Earth. The <hi>First</hi> is in these words: <hi>After
that ye have known God, or rather are known of God.</hi> This knowledge of God
is <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> There the Apostle expresseth it <hi>rather,</hi> by a <hi>being
known of God;</hi> or, as some interpret it, a <hi>being made to know by God.</hi> The
sense is the same, which is this: The coming in of God after a <hi>Spiritual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>
and making himself <hi>in the Spirit One</hi> with our Spirits; so that God in the
<hi>Power</hi> of his Spirit is the <hi>Principle by which</hi> we know: and God in the <hi>Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of his Spirit is the <hi>Object which</hi> we know.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>we know God,</hi> not an <hi>Earthly Figure</hi> only of God. Now we are <hi>known
of God.</hi> For we are taken up into the <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of God. Now we are
<hi>made to know by God.</hi> For it is God, who both <hi>knows,</hi> and <hi>is known</hi> in us. It
is the <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> which we know.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second State</hi> described is in these words: <hi>How turn ye again to weak;
and beggerly Elements?</hi> The <hi>Principles</hi> of this Creation are these <hi>Elements,</hi>
which are <hi>weak,</hi> because they cannot hold forth God to us, but in a very <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain</hi>
way, full of <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Doubt.</hi> They are <hi>Beggerly,</hi> because they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
to us very little of the <hi>Riches, Fulness, Greatness, Grace, Glory</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>When we <hi>first</hi> come to the knowledge of God, for the most part we know
him after this manner, by the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>this
World.</hi> And so long we are in <hi>Bondage,</hi> carried on by <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
way: seeing very little Glory, enjoying very little <hi>Freedom</hi> in our Religion.</p>
            <p>You that are in this Condition, whose <hi>Fears</hi> are your <hi>Food,</hi> whose <hi>Tears</hi> are
your <hi>Drink,</hi> by Day and Night: Up, and be travelling forward thorow this
Shadowy Vale, you may come to such a State of Holiness even here in this Life,
as will be a Heaven compared with this Wilderness, in which now you wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
When you shall attain to a <hi>Spiritual understanding</hi> of Things, you will
think your selves come forth from a <hi>Prison-bonse,</hi> in which before, like <hi>Samson,</hi>
you were made to Grind, with your <hi>Eyes out;</hi> into a <hi>Palace,</hi> where you sit, and
reign like Kings, in a Divine <hi>Light, Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we may, while we live here, attain to a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Royalty Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi>
in respect to the <hi>former State</hi> of our Spirits, in an <hi>Inferiour Degree</hi> of
Holiness.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Answ.</hi> We may enjoy the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> on <hi>Earth</hi> in the <hi>First-fruits</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the name of those Saints, that were as he
was: <hi>Not only they,</hi> (that is, the Creature) <hi>but we also, who have the First-fruits
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49838:76"/>
of the Spirit, even we our selves, groan in our selves, waiting for the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is, the Redemption of our Bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>First-fruits of the Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> in the <hi>First-fruits.</hi> For
the <hi>Kingdom of God is in the Holy Ghost.</hi> And <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These <hi>First-fruits</hi> are not from that Life, which the Soul hath in the <hi>Body.</hi>
For in that Life the <hi>groans</hi> for the <hi>Adoption.</hi> But they are from that Life, which
she hath above the <hi>Body</hi> in her <hi>Spirit,</hi> of which she hath some <hi>Glympses, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,</hi>
and <hi>Fore-tasts,</hi> as she is in the <hi>Body.</hi> And these are her <hi>First-fruits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Body</hi> is, as yet, <hi>Un-redeemed</hi> from a <hi>Double Darkness,</hi> that of the <hi>Flesh,</hi>
and that of the <hi>Devil.</hi> The Soul, as she lives in the Body, hath her <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
with <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>one,</hi> in the <hi>Enmity</hi> of the <hi>Other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as kept
under by a <hi>hard Master,</hi> and opposed by a <hi>cruel Enemy</hi> both at once.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Answ.</hi> We may on <hi>Earth</hi> enter into the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and the
<hi>Joy of our Lord,</hi> by <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Corin. 5. 6, 7. We are alwaies Confident, knowing, that, while we are at
home in the Body, we are absent from the Lord. For we walk not by Sight, but by
Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Paul</hi> plainly signifies; that <hi>our Presence</hi> in the <hi>Body</hi> necessarily imports,
and carries along with it an <hi>Absence</hi> from the <hi>Lord Jesus.</hi> But this is in respect
to the <hi>Presence</hi> of <hi>Vision,</hi> and <hi>Sight;</hi> not of <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While we are in the Body, we may have that <hi>Presence</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi>
which we shall have by <hi>Sight,</hi> when we are out of the <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Body</hi> is an <hi>Image,</hi> which bears a <hi>Representation</hi> of the Divine Body, or
Image of Things in the Spirit; but together with a <hi>Darkness hiding</hi> that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Image, which is Christ, and a <hi>Contrariety opposing</hi> it.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> by his Spirit shews forth himself in this Bodily Life to us,
so that we see him in the <hi>Fleshly Image</hi> as in a <hi>Glass;</hi> under a <hi>Fleshly Vail,</hi> as
in the <hi>Dark;</hi> thorow the <hi>Contrariety</hi> of the <hi>Fleshly Appearance,</hi> as in a <hi>Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</hi>
Yet we see <hi>Him,</hi> we enjoy his true Appearance in the midst of all these
<hi>Difficulties.</hi> And while we see him, we see all these <hi>Difficulties</hi> reconciled, and
subdued in <hi>Him;</hi> we our selves live in <hi>Him.</hi> Thus we enter into the <hi>Kingdom,</hi>
and <hi>Joy</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> even while we are in the <hi>Fleshly Body</hi> to <hi>Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we dye, then the Fleshly Body, and Image is swallowed up in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anl
Darkness. Our Souls then come <hi>Home</hi> to Jesus Christ; they enjoy the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Appearance</hi> of Things in its own Likeness, <hi>Face to Face,</hi> by <hi>Sight;</hi> no
more by <hi>Faith:</hi> no more in a <hi>Glass,</hi> or in a <hi>Riddle;</hi> because the <hi>Fleshly Body</hi>
is taken away: but yet in the <hi>Dark</hi> still; not with a Perfect <hi>Clearness,</hi> or <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
though with a <hi>Nearness,</hi> and <hi>Likeness;</hi> until the <hi>Body</hi> be re-assumed out of
that <hi>Darkness,</hi> as a <hi>Divine Body.</hi> Then, as in Christ, so in us, the <hi>Fulness</hi> of the
God-Head shall dwell <hi>Bodily,</hi> in its own Body, which is our Body risen again
out of <hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> into the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49838:77"/>
Till then we have the <hi>Fulness</hi> of the God-Head dwelling in us in a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Body, before</hi> Death: We have have it dwelling in us <hi>without a Body,</hi> like
an <hi>Appearance,</hi> or <hi>Apparition,</hi> like a <hi>Soul without a Body, in</hi> Death.</p>
            <p>I will attempt to make the <hi>Answer</hi> to this <hi>Question</hi> more plain, and perfect
by a Two fold <hi>Distinction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Distinct. <hi>The</hi> Spiritual Man <hi>hath a</hi> Three-fold State.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Spiritual Man</hi> at <hi>first</hi> lies hid under the <hi>Natural Man,</hi> as <hi>Seed</hi> under
the Ground. So <hi>St. Paul</hi> speaks of it, <hi>Gal. 3. 19. Wherefore then served the
Law, it was added because of Transgressions, till the Seed should come, to whom
the Promise was made: and it was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While a Man lives under the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Seed</hi> of Promise is not yet come,
that is, the <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> which is One with Christ, and so the <hi>Promised Seed</hi>
is not come up, or put forth in the Soul. But it lies hid under the <hi>Ministry</hi> of
<hi>Angels,</hi> which restrain Sin by inward <hi>Impressions,</hi> and outward <hi>Dispensations</hi> of
the Good, or Evil Things of this World: and it lies hid under a <hi>Mediator,</hi>
which is the <hi>Earthly Image</hi> of God, according to this Creation, in which God
stands as a <hi>Mediator,</hi> between Man, and Himself in the <hi>Spiritual Image,</hi> which
is the Heavenly Person of Jesus Christ. God in this Earthly Image <hi>Heightens,</hi>
and <hi>Suppresseth</hi> Sin, by his <hi>Divided Appearances</hi> of Mercy, and Wrath; by
his <hi>Divided Administrations</hi> of Allurement, and Terror; Reward and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Thus God as a <hi>Mediator</hi> stands between Man, and the Person of Christ; hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that Person, together with the Spiritual Man, which is in Christ from
Man. And so God converseth with Man, at this Distance, after this manner,
till the <hi>Seed come,</hi> in which <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> are no more <hi>Two,</hi> but <hi>One Spirit</hi> in
Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First State</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Man</hi> breaks forth thorow the <hi>Natural Man,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<hi>in</hi> it, and together <hi>with</hi> it, <hi>Gal. 2. 20. I live, yet not I, but Christ li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
in me; and the life, which I live, is by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Spiritual Man</hi> are joyned together by an inseparable Union.
When these break forth in a Man yet clothed with <hi>Flesh;</hi> they draw the <hi>Person</hi>
of a Man, to have his Life <hi>in themselves,</hi> as in his <hi>proper Principle.</hi> They shew
forth themselves to him, as that <hi>Appearance,</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> of Things, in which
he is to dwell. The <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> are now as a Death to a Man, so far,
as he abides in them. The <hi>Fleshly Image</hi> of Things, is a <hi>Prison,</hi> or an <hi>Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
or a <hi>Whorish Woman</hi> to him. He loaths the Embraces of it, though he
cannot quite shake it off. A Saint now labours to crucify, and casts off both these.
Yet while he is shut up in them, he comforts himself <hi>in,</hi> he casts himself <hi>upon</hi>
the Spiritual Man; and the Life of Christ, which dwell <hi>in These</hi> together with
him, and look forth <hi>thorow these,</hi> as thorow the <hi>Lattices</hi> upon him.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Third State</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual Man,</hi> is that, in which he is <hi>Absolute,</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:49838:77"/>
free from the Bonds of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> no more <hi>Comprehended by,</hi> but <hi>Comprehending</hi>
the <hi>Natural Man in</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>St. Paul <hi>speaks of this</hi> State, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5. 2. In this we groan earnestly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to be cloathed upon with our House, which is from Heaven.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is at the same time, Blessed, and Glorious in Heaven; yet
withal living in thy Flesh, who art a Member of Him, and suffering with thee:
So thy Spiritual Man, even while it is <hi>streightned</hi> here below in thy <hi>Natural
Life,</hi> is <hi>at Liberty</hi> above in Heaven in Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>This Man at once comes down from <hi>Above</hi> in its full Glory upon thee; and
breaks forth from <hi>Below,</hi> from out of thy Fleshly Life to a full Liberty. And
this is the <hi>House,</hi> which comes down from Heaven, to cloath thee, that thou
mayst not be <hi>naked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>House</hi> from Heaven doth not cloath thee, till thy <hi>Earthly Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
be dissolved in Death; as appears by the <hi>first verse</hi> of that <hi>Chapter</hi> cited next
before, 2 <hi>Corin. 5. 1. When our Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved, we have a
House not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the <hi>Three States</hi> of the <hi>Spiritual Man.</hi> The <hi>First</hi> of these is the
<hi>Legal State</hi> of a Christian. The <hi>Second,</hi> is the <hi>Evangelical State</hi> before Death.
The <hi>Third</hi> is the <hi>Angelical State,</hi> that State to which we cannot come, but by
<hi>Death,</hi> or a <hi>Change</hi> instead of Death, when, as Jesus Christ speaketh, <hi>We shall
be as the Angels in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much we have spoken of the <hi>First Distinction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Distinct.</hi> The <hi>Second Distinction</hi> is upon the <hi>Spiritual Man</hi> in the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
State;</hi> or upon an <hi>Evangelical Christian</hi> in this Life. He also hath <hi>Three
Distinct Growths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. Iohn <hi>speaks of all</hi> Three <hi>in</hi> One Place, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 12. I write to you
Little Children, because your Sins are forgiven for his Names sake. v. 13. I write
unto you Fathers, because you have known Him, who is from the Beginning. I
write unto you Young Men, because ye have overcome the Wicked One. I write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you little Children, because ye have known the Father. v. 14. I have written
unto you Fathers, because ye have known Him, that is from the Beginning. I have
written unto you Young Men, because ye are strong, and the Word of God abideth
in you, and ye have overcome the Wicked One.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apostle</hi> doubles his mention of all <hi>Three Growths,</hi> for <hi>Certainty,</hi> and
<hi>Efficacy;</hi> that we may take the more <hi>Clear,</hi> and <hi>Distinct</hi> notice of it, He pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the <hi>Two Extreams,</hi> the <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>Fathers, First.</hi> Then he puts the
<hi>Middle-State</hi> in the <hi>Last</hi> Place; because that is the more <hi>Remarkable,</hi> and <hi>Active</hi>
in the World. The <hi>Children</hi> are not yet grown up to the <hi>Conflict.</hi> The <hi>Fathers</hi>
are past the <hi>Brunt,</hi> and violence of it. For the same Reason in his <hi>Repetition</hi>
he adds something, when he speaks of the <hi>Young Men</hi> to encourage them.</p>
            <p>Now let us speak a word or two particularly of <hi>Each</hi> of these <hi>Growths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>First Growth</hi> of an <hi>Evangelical Christian</hi> is his <hi>Child-hood.</hi> The spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49838:78"/>
Man, when it first begins to put forth itself in us, suits itself much to our
<hi>Natural Capacities,</hi> puts itself into <hi>Fleshly Forms,</hi> and Appearances, as into
<hi>Swathing Bands.</hi> Yet it submits and subordinates all these Appearances, to the
Spiritual Appearance itself in the highest, and most grown State. It Owns That;
It <hi>Depends</hi> upon That: It Directs its Growth to That, Thus it is a <hi>Little
Child,</hi> and <hi>Knows the Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly</hi> an <hi>Evangelical Christian</hi> comes to be a <hi>Young Man.</hi> This is
then, when thou comest to distinguish between the <hi>Fleshly,</hi> and the <hi>Spiritual</hi>
Appearances of the Spiritual Man, or of Jesus Christ in thee.</p>
            <p>When a Saint grows strong in Spiritual Appearances, when he begins to
<hi>abide firm</hi> in them; then he sets himself against the Fleshly Appearances; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Devil hath his <hi>Chiefest Strength,</hi> and <hi>Seat</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>And now thou hast <hi>overcome the Wicked One,</hi> when once thou hast discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and discerned the <hi>Fleshly Appearances</hi> from the <hi>Spiritual Life</hi> itself. When
thou labourest to crucify the <hi>One,</hi> as fast, as it Grows up; that thou mayst live
more abundantly in the <hi>Other:</hi> thou hast now taken from the Devil his most
<hi>Principal Power, and Engine.</hi> He is now falling apace, like <hi>Lightning from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
in thy Soul.</p>
            <p>This is thy <hi>Growth,</hi> when thou art come to be a <hi>Young Man</hi> in Christ.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thou art a Father</hi> in the Gospel. when <hi>thou knowest Him, who was from
the Beginning.</hi> This is the <hi>End,</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> in thy Heart, to
bring forth that <hi>Mystery of God,</hi> which was <hi>hid</hi> from the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the
<hi>World:</hi> to <hi>Discover</hi> God in thee, as he is the <hi>First,</hi> and the <hi>Last;</hi> the <hi>Beginning</hi>
and the <hi>End;</hi> the <hi>Almighty;</hi> the <hi>All-comprehending; the same Yesterday, to Day,
and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When thou knowest God, as <hi>He was from the Beginning;</hi> thou knowest him,
as the <hi>Fulness,</hi> Gathering up all things into <hi>One Glory</hi> in Himself; thou knowest
him, as the <hi>Fountain,</hi> sending forth all things from himself; thou knowest him,
as a <hi>Father,</hi> living in all things, as his own <hi>Out-goings,</hi> and loving all things
for his own sake.</p>
            <p>When thou knowest <hi>God</hi> after this manner, thou knowest <hi>thy self,</hi> as thou
wert <hi>in God from the Beginning.</hi> This <hi>Appearance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>thy self,</hi> which
was <hi>from the Beginning,</hi> being brought forth in thee, changes thee into their
own <hi>Likeness.</hi> So thou becomest <hi>like</hi> God, a <hi>Father, Possessing</hi> the <hi>Fulness</hi> of all,
<hi>Flowing</hi> forth into all, <hi>Enjoying</hi> thy self sweetly <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>thorow</hi> all.</p>
            <p>But this is to be remembred all along, that thou hast this <hi>Discovery</hi> of God,
and <hi>Conformity</hi> to God in this <hi>High State,</hi> not <hi>Absolutely,</hi> or <hi>Nakedly:</hi> but thou
hast it <hi>vailed</hi> under the <hi>Darkness</hi> of the Flesh, and <hi>mingled</hi> with the <hi>Frailties</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Highest Degree</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical State</hi> on <hi>Earth.</hi> But it falls
short of the <hi>Angelical State</hi> after <hi>Death.</hi> It is <hi>next</hi> to it, the <hi>Image,</hi> and the
<hi>First-fruits</hi> of it.</p>

               <hi>This is the</hi> Answer <hi>to the</hi> First Question: How far one may enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God on Earth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. How may we attain to this <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Joy,</hi> which is the
<hi>Kingdom of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> My <hi>way</hi> of answering to this <hi>Question</hi> shall be by <hi>Shewing</hi> you those
<hi>Mistakes,</hi> which keep very many Saints very long from this Joy; and then by
endeavouring to <hi>remove</hi> those <hi>Mistakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These <hi>Mistakes</hi> are Principally <hi>Three:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Mistake: That Spiritual joy is indeed the Delight, but not the Duty of a
Saint.</item>
                  <item>2. Mistake: That we are to take the Rise of our Ioy from a Reflection upon
something in our selves.</item>
                  <item>3. Mistake: That Spiritual Darkness, Desertions and Griefs cannot stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with Spiritual Ioys.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I will begin with the <hi>First</hi> of these <hi>Mistakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Mistake: That Spiritual Joy may be the Delight, but is not the Duty of a
Christian.</hi> This is a <hi>Secret Principle,</hi> which works very often in the most Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Hearts: That <hi>This Joy</hi> is rather the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of a grown Saint; than a
<hi>Precept</hi> from God to every Child of his that it is, a <hi>Reward</hi> for great Services, and
Progresses in the Way of Christ; but not a <hi>Work</hi> Enjoyned, and Expected by Christ.</p>
            <p>I will propound to you <hi>Five Rules</hi> for the taking away of <hi>this mistake.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Rule: The Command in Scripture.</item>
               <item>2. Rule: The Inseparableness of Knowledge, and Ioy in Spiritual Things.</item>
               <item>3. Rule: The Inseparableness of Faith, and Ioy.</item>
               <item>4. Rule: The Inseparableness of Love, and Ioy.</item>
               <item>5. Rule: The Inseparableness of Purity, or Holiness, and Ioy.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Rule: The Command in Scripture.</hi> I could give very many <hi>Instances</hi> in
the plain <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> where <hi>All</hi> without any <hi>Note</hi> of <hi>Distinction</hi>
are commanded to <hi>Rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will satisfy my self with the mention of that <hi>One Place:</hi> Philip. 4. 4.
<hi>Rejoyce in the Lord alway: I say again, Rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See how the Apostle <hi>Doubles</hi> the Command, and speaks it with a <hi>vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
and tells you <hi>plainly,</hi> that it is his <hi>Command,</hi> and <hi>Charge</hi> to you from the
Lord. <hi>I say again, Rejoyce.</hi> He speaks, as if he knew, how apt we were to
<hi>Mistake</hi> in this <hi>Point,</hi> and think <hi>Spiritual Joy</hi> were no <hi>Precept</hi> from God, or
<hi>Duty</hi> in us.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>extends</hi> the Command to <hi>all Persons,</hi> and <hi>all Times: Rejoyce
alwaies.</hi> No <hi>Person</hi> is excused, no <hi>Condition</hi> is exempted from this <hi>Delightful
Duty</hi> of <hi>Rejoycing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> clearly implies the <hi>Reason, why</hi> the <hi>Command</hi> is so <hi>unlimited,</hi> in that
word: <hi>In the Lord.</hi> Can any Condition be so <hi>Sad,</hi> as to take away thy <hi>Joy</hi>
in Jesus Christ? Is there any <hi>Affliction</hi> in which thou hast a <hi>Greater Cause</hi> of
<hi>Sorrow,</hi> than thou hast of <hi>Mirth</hi> in thy <hi>Saviour?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:49838:79"/>
Hath not <hi>He Comforts</hi> for every <hi>Season? Cures</hi> for every <hi>Sore?</hi> Cannot <hi>He</hi>
make thy <hi>Affliction</hi> itself <hi>matter of Glorious Joy;</hi> and turn thy <hi>Covering</hi> of
<hi>Sack-cloth</hi> into a <hi>Garment</hi> of <hi>Praise?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no <hi>Person,</hi> which is not a <hi>Proper Subject</hi> for <hi>Joy,</hi> as he <hi>is in Jesus
Christ.</hi> There is no <hi>Condition,</hi> which is not a <hi>Proper Object</hi> of <hi>Joy,</hi> if it be
<hi>seen in Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Rule: The Inseparableness of Knowledge, and Joy in Spiritual Things.</hi>
Thou <hi>knowest</hi> no more <hi>Spiritually,</hi> than thou <hi>Rejoycest. Spiritual Knowledge,</hi> and
<hi>Spiritual Joy</hi> are <hi>born</hi> together, <hi>grow</hi> together, <hi>sleep</hi> together, <hi>wake</hi> together in
the Soul of Man.</p>
            <p>Thou art no longer in the <hi>Light</hi> of the Lord, than thou art in the <hi>Joy</hi> of
the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prov. 3. 17. Her ways are ways of Pleasantness; all her Paths are Peace. Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
speaks of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>understanding.</hi> This <hi>Place</hi> hath a <hi>Two-fold Sense: First,</hi>
all the <hi>Ways</hi> of God, as <hi>He</hi> goes forth in them <hi>by Jesus Christ,</hi> who is the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
of God, are <hi>Peace,</hi> that is, a <hi>Sweet, Agreeable Harmony</hi> in themselves, and
with the Soul of Man. They are <hi>Pleasantness,</hi> that is, a <hi>Sparkling forth</hi> with
<hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to every Faculty, or Desire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly:</hi> The <hi>Ways,</hi> and out-goings of <hi>Wisdom</hi> in thy Soul carry <hi>Peace,</hi> and
<hi>Pleasure</hi> along with them. If the <hi>Light</hi> of God <hi>shine</hi> upon any <hi>Thing</hi> in thy
Spirit, it will put a <hi>Joy</hi> upon that <hi>Thing.</hi> So far as thou seest Things in the
<hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of God, as he goes forth in them; thou canst not but have
<hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>Joy</hi> proceeds from <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or a <hi>Fleshly understanding,</hi> which
is <hi>Darkness,</hi> and not <hi>Light;</hi> or a <hi>Perverted Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So far as thou hast a <hi>Right understanding,</hi> a <hi>Spiritual Knowledge</hi> of God, thy
<hi>self,</hi> or <hi>this Creation,</hi> thou canst not but have <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> if thou hast a <hi>Spiritual Knowledge of God,</hi> thou wilt be fill'd
with <hi>Joy.</hi> If thou knowest <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> thou knowest Him in <hi>Glory.</hi> For
the <hi>Spirit of God, and of Glory</hi> are both <hi>One, 1. Pet.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
            <p>When thou knowest <hi>God Spiritually,</hi> thou knowest <hi>Him,</hi> as <hi>He</hi> knoweth
<hi>Himself. For God is a Spirit, John</hi> 4. So thou hast the same <hi>Object of Joy,</hi>
thou hast before thee the same Image to <hi>Rejoyce in,</hi> as <hi>God, himself</hi> hath.</p>
            <p>When thou comest to a <hi>Spiritual knowledge of God,</hi> thou standest in a <hi>Light,</hi>
in which thou seest all Things, as <hi>Horses of Fire,</hi> and <hi>Chariots of Fire,</hi> of <hi>this
Fire,</hi> which is <hi>God in Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou knowest any thing of God <hi>Spiritually,</hi> thou knowest <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>Bring
forth All,</hi> to <hi>Fill All,</hi> to <hi>Be All:</hi> Thou seest all Things, as <hi>Light</hi> in <hi>His Light,
Living</hi> in <hi>His Life, Spirits</hi> in <hi>This Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Canst thou <hi>want Joy,</hi> when thou meetest with every thing <hi>in God,</hi> the
<hi>Fruit of God, Full of God, One Spirit with God</hi> to thee?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:49838:79"/>
2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> if thou know <hi>thy self Spiritually,</hi> thou canst not <hi>want Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Spiritual Knowledge of thy self holds thee forth to thy self, as <hi>One Spirit
with Jesus Christ.</hi> Thou seest <hi>thy self there, where</hi> thou seest <hi>Christ.</hi> Thou seest
<hi>Jesus Christ there, where</hi> thou seest <hi>thy self. He that is joyned to the Lord, is one
Spirit with Him, 1 Corin.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
            <p>Dost thou in any <hi>Sufferings</hi> know, that <hi>Isus Christ</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> make but <hi>One
Spirit</hi> in those Sufferings; and canst thou forbear to <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in them?</p>
            <p>Canst thou <hi>think</hi> of no Glory or Blessedness in Heaven itself, but thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
that <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> make but <hi>One Spirit</hi> in that Glory; and canst
thou chuse, but Joy in it?</p>
            <p>Hast thou this Knowledge, that thy <hi>Saviour</hi> and thy <hi>self</hi> run along thorow
all Things. Twisted into <hi>One Spirit,</hi> undivided in Light, and Darkness, from
the Beginning to the End of Things? and hast thou not <hi>Joy</hi> in all Things?</p>
            <p>A <hi>Spiritual Knowledge</hi> of thy self teacheth thee to look upon <hi>thy self,</hi> as
made in the <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Likeness</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jesus Christ saith of Himself,</hi> Iohn 3. 13. No man hath ascended up into
Heaven, but He, that came down from Heaven, even the Son of Man, that is in
Heaven.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ had <hi>One Part</hi> of Himself <hi>above</hi> in Heaven, at the same time,
that the <hi>Other Part</hi> of Him was <hi>below</hi> on Earth.</p>
            <p>As Jesus Christ <hi>unites</hi> God, and the Creature in his own Person; his <hi>Face</hi>
being as the <hi>Sun</hi> shining in the Highest Glory, when his <hi>Feet</hi> are in the <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi>
the Fire and Fading State of the lowest Things: So the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man in
her <hi>Natural State unites</hi> the <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Invisible,</hi> and the
<hi>Visible Part</hi> of this Creation.</p>
            <p>Thy <hi>Soul</hi> in her <hi>Top,</hi> and <hi>Supream Part,</hi> which is her <hi>Truest</hi> self, and <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
lives ever Invisibly, and Immortally among the <hi>Angels. She</hi> in the mean
time subsists here below among these Fleeting Shadows, only in her Lower
Part, in which she is, but as a <hi>Shadow</hi> of herself.</p>
            <p>He that knows this, hath <hi>this Joy</hi> alwaies, that the Inconstancies, and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
of this Life wet but his <hi>Feet,</hi> trouble his <hi>Dreams</hi> only: His <hi>Better Part,</hi>
his <hi>Waking Part,</hi> His <hi>Life</hi> is Constant above these <hi>Floods</hi> in the Company of
<hi>Spirits. Death</hi> catcheth thy <hi>Shadow,</hi> and no more of thee. Thy true self is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the <hi>Region,</hi> and <hi>Reach</hi> of Death, <hi>Immortal,</hi> as the <hi>Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But behold! A <hi>Greater Cause</hi> of Joy! Thy <hi>Soul</hi> in her <hi>Spiritual State</hi> hath
a <hi>fuller Resemblance</hi> of her Saviour. That <hi>Life,</hi> which thy Soul hath at the
<hi>Top</hi> of this Creation, is yet but a <hi>Dream,</hi> a <hi>Show,</hi> the <hi>Feet</hi> only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psal. 17. 15. I shall be satisfied, when I awake with thy Likeness:</hi> Saith
<hi>David.</hi> The <hi>Soul</hi> in this Creation is fallen into a <hi>Sleep,</hi> she hath her <hi>Sleeping
Part</hi> only here; and her Life at Highest even in the <hi>Angelical State</hi> of it, is
but a <hi>Dream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Waking,</hi> and <hi>Chief Part,</hi> the <hi>Head</hi> of thy <hi>Soul</hi> is
above <hi>Angels</hi> with <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:49838:80"/>
Iohn 13. 9, 10. Peter said to Christ: Not my Feet only, but my Hands, and
my Head. Iesus saith unto him, He that is washed, needeth not save to wash his
Feet, but is clean every whit.</p>
            <p>All of thee, that comes within the Compass of this Creation, thy <hi>Immortal,</hi>
as well, as thy <hi>Mortal</hi> Part, all is but thy <hi>Feet.</hi> For <hi>all that</hi> needs <hi>Washing.</hi> Thy

ever <hi>un-troubled, un-spotted,</hi> the <hi>same Yesterday, to Day, and for ever,</hi> like <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dost thou thus <hi>Spiritually discern</hi> thy <hi>self?</hi> Thou canst not then but rejoice
in the midst of all <hi>Changes,</hi> and <hi>Confusions.</hi> For thou seest thy <hi>Life,</hi> thy
<hi>True Being;</hi> thou seest thy self <hi>awake;</hi> in an <hi>Unchangeable State,</hi> with all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi>
round about thee, as <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thirdly:</hi> If thou know <hi>this World Spiritually,</hi> thou canst not <hi>want Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we look upon <hi>this World</hi> after a Spiritual manner we see it, as a <hi>Show.
Man walks in a vain Show, Psal.</hi> 39. 6. What <hi>Pain</hi> have all the Miseries of
this World to Him, that looks on them, as an <hi>Empty Show,</hi> without any <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
of Evil? Nay, what <hi>Peace,</hi> or what <hi>Pleasure</hi> do they afford thee, when
they are, as a <hi>Tempest</hi> in a <hi>Picture,</hi> or a <hi>Battel</hi> in a <hi>Story?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Spiritual Eye perceives this World in all the <hi>Pieces,</hi> and <hi>Particularities</hi> of
it, to be an <hi>Image</hi> of Heavenly Glories, <hi>Rom. 1. 20. The Invisible things of
Him are clearly seen by the Things, that are made: Even His Eternal Power, and
God-Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mind</hi> of Man naturally rejoyceth to see a <hi>Resemblance</hi> of any thing,
especially of <hi>Excellent</hi> Things, especially of Things <hi>Beloved.</hi> Thou canst not
carry a <hi>Spiritual understanding</hi> with thee thorow the World; but thou wilt
<hi>rejoyce</hi> over all the Works of God in the World, when thou seest thy God,
with his <hi>Beauties,</hi> and <hi>Blessednesses Imaged</hi> forth, and brought to thy mind by
them all.</p>
            <p>If there be any Thing, which is most Dark to thee; thou wilt say of that:
<hi>Yet here is something of my God pictured out, though I know not, what of Him it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This World <hi>is a</hi> Principal Part <hi>of the</hi> Mystery of God. When the Seventh
Trumpet shall sound, then shall the Mystery of God be finished, Revel. 10. 7.</p>
            <p>This World is indeed a <hi>Deep</hi> of Darkness, yet it hath the <hi>Wonders</hi> of God
in it. <hi>They that go down into the Deep, see the Wonders of the Lord, Psal.</hi> 107. 24.</p>
            <p>The Soul <hi>sports</hi> itself, and <hi>plays</hi> with the Miserablest Things of the World,
when she perceives herself to be in them, as in the midst of the <hi>Mystery</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> and among his <hi>Wonders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>Second Rule,</hi> by which you see, that your Spiritual
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> go Hand in Hand.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Rule: Faith,</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> are ever in an <hi>Equal Degree,</hi> and <hi>Activity.</hi> St.
<hi>Paul</hi> prays for the <hi>Romans,</hi> Rom. 15. 13. <hi>Now the God of Hope fill you with
all Peace, and Joy in Believing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> are Companions of equal <hi>Stature,</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> in the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49838:80"/>

            </list>
            <p>1. A <hi>Joyful Prospect. Faith is the Evidence of Things not seen:</hi> Heb. 11.
1. <hi>Faith</hi> sets Heaven, with all its Angels, Spirits, Joys, Glory, Christ, and
God, whatsoever is Excellent, and Invisible, <hi>in thine Eye. Faith</hi> discovers all
these Things to thee, with a <hi>Conviction,</hi> and <hi>Demonstration</hi> of their <hi>Reality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that believes, hath presented to the <hi>Sight</hi> of his Mind, that <hi>Frame</hi> of
Things, in which <hi>God</hi> lives; and that not as a <hi>Show,</hi> or <hi>Apparition,</hi> but in a
<hi>Substantial</hi> manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Angel of the Lord pitcheth his Camp round about those that fear him:
Psal.</hi> 34. 7. This <hi>Camp</hi> hath in it all the <hi>Powers</hi> of the <hi>Angelical,</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature.</hi> These continually encamp about a Saint, and encompass him in
the midst of themselves. But they are <hi>Invisible,</hi> and Faith is their <hi>Evidence,</hi> the
<hi>Discovery</hi> of them to thee, in their <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Jesus Christ had his <hi>Sufferings</hi> upon him, he had a <hi>Joy before Him,
Heb.</hi> 12. 2. So much of <hi>Faith,</hi> as thou hast <hi>in</hi> thee, so much of <hi>Joy</hi> thou
hast continually before thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith,</hi> when thou art in a <hi>Dungeon</hi> gives thee such a <hi>Prospect</hi> into Heaven,
and the God-Head; as <hi>reflects</hi> a <hi>Joy,</hi> and a <hi>Divinity</hi> upon the <hi>Dungeon</hi> itself.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly Faith</hi> gives thee a <hi>Joyful Possession.</hi> A Wise man among the
<hi>Heathen</hi> tells us, that there are <hi>Three ways</hi> of being united to God; <hi>by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
by Love; by Faith.</hi> But, saith he, this <hi>Faith</hi> is no <hi>Empty Image,</hi> or <hi>Thin
Persuasion;</hi> but a <hi>Substantial Incorporation</hi> of the <hi>Things</hi> themselves with the <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So saith the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> Heb. 11. 1. <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Presence</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the
<hi>Subsistence of Things Hoped for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can you <hi>have,</hi> what you <hi>Hope</hi> for, and not have Joy? Do you <hi>Hope</hi> for
Heaven, for Jesus Christ, for Freedom from Sin, and Troubles? Do you <hi>Hope</hi>
for <hi>Joy?</hi> So much Faith, as you have, so much <hi>Joy</hi> you <hi>have,</hi> so much you
have already of all that, which you <hi>Hope</hi> for.</p>
            <p>Dost thou say; thou hast <hi>Faith,</hi> and by <hi>Faith</hi> the <hi>Presence</hi> of thy Saviour,
the <hi>Possession</hi> of Glory, and yet hast thou no <hi>Joy?</hi> Say not, thou Believest; but
shew me thy <hi>Faith</hi> by thy <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He, that <hi>believes,</hi> cannot but have <hi>Joy in Believing;</hi> no more, than he that
walks in the <hi>Light</hi> of the Sun, can be without its <hi>Heat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, <hi>there is in</hi> Faith <hi>a</hi> Ioyful Purchase. <hi>The</hi> Life, that I live, <hi>saith</hi>
St. Paul, is by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for
me, Galat. 2. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> makes an <hi>Exchange</hi> between Christ, and a Saint. If thou believest, the
Lord Jesus hath given <hi>Himself for thee. Christ</hi> stands in <hi>thy Stead.</hi> And thou
standest in the <hi>Stead of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:49838:81"/>
               <hi>Christ</hi> fills <hi>thy Room,</hi> in the Flesh, the world, and all Sufferings. He bears
the <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>thy Person</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou</hi> fillest the <hi>Room</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and bearest the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ in all these.
Can such an <hi>Exchange,</hi> as this be without its <hi>Joy,</hi> when Christ <hi>stands for</hi> thee
in Sorrows, under the <hi>Guilt,</hi> and <hi>Infirmity</hi> of them: when thou <hi>standest for</hi>
Christ in the <hi>Mystery</hi> of Them?</p>
            <p>This <hi>Purchase,</hi> or <hi>Exchange</hi> is made in <hi>Glory</hi> too. The Lord Jesus is set in
<hi>thy place</hi> in Heaven, as <hi>Thou</hi> being the <hi>Principle,</hi> and he the <hi>Deputy. I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a Place for you,</hi> saith the Lord to his Disciples, <hi>John</hi> 14. 3.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt be taken up into <hi>Christs Place</hi> there; <hi>Where I am, there ye shall
be also, John</hi> 14. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Beloved is Mine, and I am His:</hi> saith the <hi>Spouse</hi> in the <hi>Canticles.</hi> Is not
this abundant matter of Joy at all Times to thee? <hi>That Glory,</hi> which Jesus
Christ hath now in Heaven, is <hi>Thine,</hi> as it is <hi>His. That Glory,</hi> which thou shalt
have hereafter shall be <hi>Christ's</hi> together with Thine.</p>
            <p>Thou <hi>hast no</hi> Misery; Iesus Christ <hi>hath no</hi> Glory alone.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Purchase,</hi> or <hi>Exchange</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Rule: <hi>So much</hi> Spiritual Love, <hi>as there is in any Soul: so much</hi> Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Ioy <hi>is there also,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. Whom having not seen, ye Love: <hi>then it
follows a little after:</hi> Ye Rejoyce with Ioy unspeakable.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Two-fold Love;</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A Love of Benevolence.</item>
               <item>2. A Love of Complacency.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>A Love of Benevolence.</hi> If thou hast this <hi>Love</hi> to Jesus Christ; thou
wilt <hi>Rejoyce</hi> to accomplish <hi>His Will,</hi> to <hi>Glorify</hi> Him in thy Self, to make thy
Self a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in any Kind to his Good Pleasure: even, as He offered Himself
up in the Flesh to the Father.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>A Love of Complacency.</hi> Is thy <hi>Saviour</hi> thy <hi>Delight?</hi> Is He to <hi>Thee,</hi> as
He is to the <hi>Father?</hi> Is He thy <hi>Beloved, in whom thy Soul rests?</hi> Then is thy
<hi>Joy</hi> the <hi>same,</hi> in the midst of all <hi>Changes,</hi> while thy <hi>Jesus</hi> remains <hi>Unchangeable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If Jesus Christ be <hi>Altogether all Pleasantnesses,</hi> all Lovelinesses to <hi>Thee,</hi> as
the <hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>use</hi> expresseth <hi>Him</hi> to her self in the <hi>Song of Songs:</hi> then, thou canst
want no <hi>Joy,</hi> though thou be in want of all things; while thou hast <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Fourth Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Rule: Joy, and Purity</hi> are ever in the Soul in a <hi>like Degree. Holiness,</hi>
and <hi>Happiness</hi> are both <hi>One Thing</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Soul. Each</hi> is an <hi>Elevation</hi>
above all <hi>Inferiour,</hi> and <hi>Corrupting,</hi> or <hi>Corruptible</hi> Things: and an <hi>Habitation</hi>
in the <hi>Supream Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is said of God in the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> that <hi>He inhabiteth Eternity;</hi> that is,
<hi>Himself, Isa.</hi> 57. 15.</p>
            <p>It is said by the <hi>Saints</hi> to <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Psal. 90. 1. Thou hast been our Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
place from One Generation to another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pure Religion, and Undefiled before God, and the Father is; to keep Himself
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49838:81"/>
Unspotted from the World, Iames 1. 27. <hi>The World is</hi> Pitch. <hi>For it lies in a</hi>
Principle <hi>of</hi> Darkness, <hi>and</hi> Blackness. <hi>Where it</hi> Touches, <hi>it</hi> Spots.</p>
            <p>He only keeps himself <hi>Pure,</hi> who keeps himself <hi>Untoucht</hi> by the World;
<hi>Un-affected</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>So long, as your <hi>Purity</hi> is <hi>Un-stain'd:</hi> Your <hi>Pleasure</hi> will be <hi>Un-troubled.</hi> For
Troubles are <hi>below,</hi> in the <hi>Changeable</hi> State of Things. But a Holy Soul dwells
on <hi>High,</hi> in <hi>Him,</hi> who hath no <hi>Shadow</hi> of <hi>Change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trouble</hi> is in the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>in Christ all</hi> is <hi>Peace, John 16. 33. Hold up</hi>
thy Heart, that it sink not into the <hi>World: Hold off</hi> thy Heart, that it settle not
on the World; and thou at once shalt preserve thy self from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abide</hi> in Jesus Christ, <hi>Act</hi> thy self perpetually <hi>from,</hi> and <hi>upon</hi> Jesus Christ;
so shall thy <hi>Purity,</hi> and thy Pleasures flow continually like a <hi>Mighty River,</hi>
which is both <hi>Clear, and Calm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now finish't that, which I had to say in the <hi>Removal</hi> of the <hi>First
Mistake,</hi> which hinders the Soul from attaining to a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Mistake: That we are to take a Rise of our Ioy from a Reflection upon
something in our selves. <hi>We are generally apt to think, that we are to look</hi> into
our selves <hi>for the</hi> Ground <hi>of our</hi> Ioy; <hi>and that we are to</hi> measure <hi>our</hi> Ioy <hi>by
that, which we find</hi> in our selves.</p>
            <p>Go to most Christians, when you perceive them full of <hi>Joy,</hi> and ask of
them a <hi>Reason</hi> of their Joy: you shall hear them telling you, that they have
Examined their Hearts, and find a <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> to the <hi>Children</hi> of God, a
<hi>Trust</hi> in God, an unfeigned <hi>Desire</hi> to Please God, an <hi>Universal Indeavour</hi> to keep
all the Commandments of God, an <hi>Uprightness</hi> before God, a true <hi>Sorrow</hi> for
<hi>Sin,</hi> a <hi>Detestation</hi> of it, a full <hi>Purpose</hi> to forsake <hi>all</hi> Sin, with many other <hi>Goodly
Things</hi> in Themselves.</p>
            <p>Go to other Christians, who put out the <hi>Flame</hi> of Life in their Hearts by
their <hi>Sighs,</hi> and <hi>dim</hi> their Eyes with their Tears: Ask them, why they have
no more Joy in their Lives; you shall have some such Answer, as this from
them: Alas! What Joy can there be in my Life? God with-holds His <hi>Grace</hi>
from me, and I can find no <hi>Abatement</hi> of Corruption, no <hi>Life</hi> of Holiness in
my Soul. I have strong <hi>Temptations,</hi> mighty <hi>Lusts,</hi> and no <hi>Power</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them. I cannot <hi>Trust</hi> in God, or <hi>Believe</hi> in Jesus Christ, I find no <hi>Profit</hi>
in the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> I take no <hi>Pleasure</hi> at all in <hi>Spiritual</hi> Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will say; may I not <hi>rejoyce,</hi> when I discover the <hi>Workings</hi> of
<hi>Grace</hi> in my Heart? Is it not a <hi>just Cause</hi> of <hi>Grief,</hi> when I feel my Heart <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
from the <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> There is a <hi>Right,</hi> and a <hi>Wrong</hi> Way of <hi>Rejoycing</hi> and <hi>Grieving</hi> in these
Things. The <hi>Mistake</hi> lies here in not <hi>Distinguishing</hi> between these <hi>Ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psal. 3. 7. David</hi> rejoyc'd that the <hi>Lord by his Favour had made his Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
so strong.</hi> But this <hi>Mirth</hi> was quickly turn'd into <hi>Mourning.</hi> It would not
have been <hi>so,</hi> if <hi>David</hi> instead of <hi>Rejoycing</hi> in the <hi>Mountain</hi> made <hi>strong</hi> by
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49838:82"/>
the Favour of the Lord, had <hi>Rejoyc'd</hi> in the <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>his Favour,</hi> which
made that Mountain strong.</p>
            <p>Or rather, if instead of <hi>that Favour</hi> of the Lord he had made the <hi>Lord</hi> of
that Favour his <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psal. 77. Asaph</hi> abandoned all <hi>Joy,</hi> and gave himself over to <hi>Grief,</hi> for
Gods With-drawings from him in the <hi>Sensible Conveyances</hi> of <hi>His Grace</hi> to his
Soul. <hi>v.</hi> 2. 3. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he repents himself of</hi> Measuring <hi>his</hi> Ioy, <hi>or</hi> Grief, <hi>by this</hi> Standard;
<hi>and finds a</hi> Cause <hi>of Joy above these Troubles.</hi> v. 10. I said; This is mine
Infirmity, but I will remember the Years of the Right Hand of the most High.</p>
            <p>I shall speak of <hi>Spiritual Mourning,</hi> when I come to the next <hi>Mistake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time I will give you <hi>Two Rules</hi> for the <hi>Removing</hi> of the <hi>Mistake</hi>
in this <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Grounding</hi> our Joys.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Two Rules</hi> are <hi>These.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Rule: Make God, as He is in Himself, the Object of your Ioy, without
any Consideration of your selves at all.</item>
               <item>2. Rule: Take the Rise of your Ioy from Iesus Christ, not, as He Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
Himself to you: but, as He Comprehends you in Himself.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I will begin with the <hi>First Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Rule: Make God, as He is in Himself, the Object of your Ioy; without
any Consideration of your selves at all.</p>
            <p>When St. <hi>Paul commands</hi> Joy, he <hi>confines</hi> us to the <hi>Person</hi> of God, for the
<hi>Matter</hi> of our Joy. <hi>Philip. 3. 1. Finally, Brethren, Rejoyce in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> hath <hi>Space,</hi> and <hi>Room,</hi> and <hi>Entertainment</hi> enough
for thy Joys in their largest Extent. Thou needst not wander besi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es the <hi>Tents</hi>
of any Creature, <hi>within</hi> thee, or <hi>without</hi> thee.</p>
            <p>Do but still <hi>Pitch</hi> thy Thoughts upon this <hi>Mark,</hi> and thou shalt have <hi>Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of Joy. He that makes <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>He</hi> is <hi>Alone,</hi> the <hi>Matter</hi> of his Rejoycing; will
find <hi>Abundant matter</hi> of Joy in <hi>every Season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have <hi>David's</hi> Example in this kind, <hi>Psal. 118. 14. The Lord is my
Strength; and Song; He is become my Salvation.</hi> The Lord is then <hi>Strong in</hi>
you, and <hi>for</hi> you, when you receive Him in the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of His Nature, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt</hi>
with anything of the Creature.</p>
            <p>God is <hi>weakned, and straitned,</hi> when He is <hi>Compounded</hi> with any other
thing. You bring Him <hi>out</hi> of Himself, and <hi>below</hi> Himself, when you joyn Him.
with any thing <hi>besides</hi> Himself.</p>
            <p>It is said of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the Gospel; that <hi>in One Place</hi> He could do no
<hi>Great Work,</hi> because of <hi>Their Unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>Emptying,</hi> and <hi>Filling</hi> Grace. It <hi>Empties</hi> the Soul of <hi>itself,</hi> and
the <hi>Creature.</hi> It <hi>Fills</hi> the Soul with <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While we abide in <hi>Unbelief,</hi> that is, in any Thing of our <hi>Own,</hi> or the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi>
we <hi>weaken</hi> God in us, we <hi>bind</hi> Him, and make Him <hi>un-able: He can do
no Great Work</hi> in us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:49838:82"/>
We have God in <hi>Power,</hi> when we have Him in <hi>Purity;</hi> we have Him in
<hi>Purity,</hi> when we have Him in the <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and <hi>Nakedness</hi> of his own <hi>Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Lord is <hi>thy Strength.</hi> And thus must He be thy <hi>Song,</hi> the <hi>Subject</hi>
of thy <hi>Joy.</hi> When thou <hi>singest</hi> of God <hi>alone,</hi> then art thou <hi>strong,</hi> and hast
<hi>strong Joys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord is thy <hi>Salvation.</hi> So far, as thou goest out of thy <hi>self,</hi> and the
<hi>World;</hi> so far, as thou entrest into <hi>God,</hi> thou entrest into <hi>Salvation, Joy,</hi> and
<hi>Heaven</hi> itself.</p>
            <p>I will back this <hi>Rule</hi> with some Particular <hi>Motives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Motive: Look to God in the Nakedness of His own Person, and you shall
see Light, without any Darkness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John 8. 12. Jesus Christ</hi> saith of Himself: <hi>I am the Light of the World,
He that followeth me, shall not walk in Darkness, but shall have the Light of Life.</hi>
Our <hi>Saviour</hi> is the <hi>Light,</hi> that <hi>points,</hi> and <hi>chalks</hi> out our way to us, He is the
<hi>Star</hi> that goes before us, and stands over the <hi>God-Head,</hi> as the <hi>House,</hi> in which
He, and We must find our <hi>Rest,</hi> and dwell for Ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Follow Christ.</hi> Which <hi>way</hi> goes Christ? He goes by the <hi>Cross,</hi> and thorow
<hi>Death.</hi> He descends to the <hi>Lowermost Darkness,</hi> Then He ascends <hi>thorow</hi> all
things, till He comes <hi>above</hi> All. He goes up above the Highest Heavens, <hi>into God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Go you after the Lord Jesus. Tread in the Steps of this Shepherd of the
Flock. Go by the <hi>Cross,</hi> the <hi>Death,</hi> and the lowest <hi>Darkness.</hi> Carry every thing
of the <hi>Creature</hi> with thee, this <hi>Way</hi> into <hi>These.</hi> Then rise up <hi>out</hi> of <hi>All,</hi> pass
<hi>thorow All,</hi> till thou come <hi>beyond All</hi> unto the High, and Holy <hi>Habitation</hi> of
the <hi>God-Head,</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Psal. 104. 2. Who coverest thy self with Light, as with a Garment, and
stretchest out the Heavens like a Curtain.</p>
            <p>Every Thing of the <hi>Creature</hi> is a <hi>Covering</hi> upon God, even the Brightest,
the most Beautiful Piece of the Creature; the <hi>Light</hi> itself.</p>
            <p>The Highest, and most Glorious Things, the <hi>Heavens</hi> themselves, are <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
drawn before the Lord, <hi>Hiding,</hi> and <hi>Darkning</hi> Him to us.</p>
            <p>You must break thorow the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> the Highest <hi>Heavens,</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinest

you can never be free from Fears, Doubts, Uncertainties, and Unsatisfactions.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Motive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Motive. Set your Heart, and Thoughts on God in the Simplicity of His
own Nature; and you shall sit down under Love, without any Mixture of Wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Esa.</hi> 27. 4. The Lord saith of Himself: <hi>Fury is not in me; who would
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49838:83"/>
set the Bryars, and Thorns against me in Battel? I would go through them, I would
burn them together.</hi> God, as He is in the <hi>Singleness</hi> of His own <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
hath nothing of <hi>Wrath</hi> in Him, but all Sweetness, Love, and Blessedness.</p>
            <p>God in Himself is <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> He is a Fire, a <hi>Principle</hi> of Wrath, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as He is in the <hi>Fleshly Creature,</hi> Straitned, Imprisoned, and Resisted by the
<hi>Darkness</hi> of the Flesh.</p>
            <p>If you hold up any Created Strength or Excellency before God; you set
<hi>Bryars,</hi> and <hi>Thorns</hi> against Him, upon which God <hi>Kindles</hi> in his Wrath, as a
<hi>Consuming Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Corin. 3. 11. <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>tell us, that</hi> Iesus Christ is the Foundation, <hi>and
v.</hi> 12. If any Man build upon this Foundation, Gold, Silver, Precious Stones,
Hay, Stubble; <hi>then saith He. v.</hi> 13. Every Mans work shall be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest;
it shall be revealed by Fire.</p>
            <p>Let thy <hi>God</hi> be laid in thy Heart, as the <hi>Foundation</hi> of thy Joy. He is a
<hi>Living Rock,</hi> a <hi>Living Corner-Stone.</hi> If thou <hi>resign</hi> thy self to Him, and <hi>rest</hi>
on Him: He will grow up unto a <hi>Building</hi> of Pleasure, and Glory in thee. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Precious Stones of all Joys, and Beauties, will spring up out of Him.</p>
            <p>But take thou heed of <hi>laying on</hi> any Thing, thy self, upon this <hi>Rock.</hi> For
whatever it be, though it be not <hi>Hay,</hi> and <hi>Stubble</hi> only, but <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Precious
Stones;</hi> though it should be the Immortal Excellencies of <hi>Angels,</hi> the Glory of
the <hi>First Image</hi> in Nature, the Beauties of the Earthly <hi>Paradise:</hi> This <hi>Rock</hi> of
the God-Head will be, as an Irresistible <hi>Fire</hi> at the Bottom of them, breaking
forth upon them, and Devouring them.</p>
            <p>Then thine own <hi>Person</hi> may be saved, because it is <hi>Rooted</hi> in the <hi>Rock,</hi> and
hath the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Lord in it, which abides <hi>Sure.</hi> But this will be, as
<hi>by Fire.</hi> Thou must pass thorow the <hi>Fire,</hi> in which thou shalt leave all thy
<hi>Joys</hi> behind thee, which have been <hi>thy Super-structures,</hi> and <hi>Additionals</hi> upon
the <hi>Foundation.</hi> Thy <hi>Person</hi> alone shall, escape <hi>naked</hi> out of the <hi>Fire,</hi> having
nothing left, but the naked <hi>Foundation,</hi> or the <hi>Rock,</hi> for a Clothing to it.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>John</hi> saith: <hi>He, that dwells in love, dwells in God.</hi> So far, as you dwell in
anything of the <hi>Creature,</hi> you dwell under the <hi>Vail,</hi> in the <hi>Fire,</hi> under the
<hi>Law,</hi> under an <hi>Administration</hi> of <hi>Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Death:</hi> you cannot be free
from <hi>Trouble,</hi> and <hi>Torment; Death</hi> will feed upon you.</p>
            <p>Dwell <hi>Nakedly</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> and you dwell <hi>Entirely</hi> in <hi>Love.</hi> Let a <hi>Naked God</hi>
dwell in you, and as you take in a <hi>Naked God,</hi> you take in <hi>Naked Love</hi> into
your Souls.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the <hi>Second Motive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Motive: Close with God in the Abstractedness of his own Being, as he is
unclothed of all the Creatures; and you close with Eternal Life itself, where there
is no more any Death.</p>
            <p>See how <hi>David</hi> Rejoyceth: <hi>Psal. 18. 46. The Lord lives, and Blessed be
my R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49838:83"/>
Lord alone. In the Lord he sees <hi>Life,</hi> and this is <hi>his Life.</hi> He considers nothing
Transitory, or Moveable. His <hi>Rock</hi> is alone in all his Thoughts. He <hi>Blesseth</hi> his
<hi>Rock.</hi> He triumpheth in the <hi>Blessedness</hi> of his <hi>Rock.</hi> And this is <hi>his Blessedness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Follow <hi>Davids</hi> Example, and <hi>thy Heart shall live,</hi> while there is <hi>Life</hi> in God,
Say; my <hi>Friends,</hi> and my <hi>Body</hi> may die; my <hi>Graces,</hi> and my <hi>Comforts</hi> may
wither, but the <hi>Lord lives. I</hi> may be miserable, the whole <hi>World</hi> may be mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
round about me; but Blessed be my Rock: There I see, and find a <hi>Life</hi>
in the midst of <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Blessedness</hi> in a Heap of <hi>Miseries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>lives Truly:</hi> all other Things below Him, are <hi>Dead,</hi> and have
only a <hi>Shadow</hi> of life. The Lord <hi>lives Eternally:</hi> He hath no <hi>End</hi> of Days,
no <hi>Change</hi> of Life, or <hi>Shadow</hi> of Change. The Lord <hi>lives Universally:</hi> He
<hi>lives</hi> in all Things, He <hi>comprehends</hi> all Lives in Himself, He <hi>gives</hi> a Life to all
Things in Himself: <hi>All Things live to God, Luk.</hi> 20. 38.</p>
            <p>If thou look <hi>to,</hi> or <hi>for</hi> an thing <hi>below,</hi> or <hi>besides</hi> God, thou shalt certainly
find it in the Region of the Shadow of <hi>Death;</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> feeding upon it
with his <hi>Iron Teeth</hi> of Divisions, Distractions, Cares, Changes, and Griefs.</p>
            <p>Look into the <hi>Book</hi> of this <hi>World,</hi> and thou shalt find it a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi>
where thou shalt see every thing <hi>Dead,</hi> or <hi>Dying, Betraying</hi> thee to <hi>Death,</hi> and
<hi>Amazing</hi> thee with the <hi>Fear</hi> of Death.</p>
            <p>Look into thine own <hi>Heart,</hi> and thou shalt find that, a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> and
<hi>Hell,</hi> fill'd with Darkness, Guilt, Fear, Torment. The best things there, thy
<hi>Graces</hi> are written with <hi>Black,</hi> and <hi>Bloody</hi> Letters, in much <hi>Obscurity,</hi> hard to
be discerned; in much <hi>Impurity,</hi> having little Life of <hi>Comfort</hi> in them.</p>
            <p>But if thou wilt look into the <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of God, thou shalt see the
<hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> opened to thee. <hi>God</hi> is that <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> in which thou shalt see
thy Self and all Things <hi>Written</hi> with the <hi>Beams</hi> of the <hi>Light of Life.</hi> Here
thou shalt neither read, nor hear no more sad Stories of <hi>Death.</hi> Thou shalt see
<hi>Death</hi> itself <hi>Shining</hi> in the Light of Life.</p>
            <p>God is a <hi>Bright,</hi> and the <hi>Last</hi> Darkness. The Darkness of Death itself is
swallowed up into <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> in Him. O <hi>Death I will be thy Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Live only <hi>to</hi> God, and <hi>upon</hi> God; Consider nothing but <hi>Him only.</hi> So shall
thy <hi>Joy</hi> alwaies be as <hi>Life from the Dead,</hi> as the <hi>Joy of Harvest,</hi> I mean that
Heavenly Harvest, the <hi>Resurrection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Motive: Pitch thy Spirit upon the Single Person of God; so thou shalt fall
into an Infiniteness of Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>This is the Advice of <hi>David,</hi> Psalm 37. 4. <hi>Delight thy self in the Lord,
and he shall give thee thy Hearts Desire.</hi> The <hi>Desires</hi> of man are <hi>Infiniteness</hi>
budding forth from its <hi>Seed</hi> in the Soul. These <hi>Desires</hi> are ever in Motion, and
Restless, till they put forth into <hi>Infiniteness</hi> itself. All the Creatures are too
Strait, and Narrow for them. They are Unquiet, while they are contained
within the Compass of any Creature; because every Creature is <hi>Finite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They beat against the sides of it, till they break thorow it into the <hi>Innfinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:49838:84"/>
Make God thy Delight; and there is nothing which thou canst <hi>think</hi> of,
or <hi>wish</hi> for, but thou shalt have it in him. In God thou shalt meet with thy
Self, in any State, or Form, in all States or Forms, which thou canst desire, <hi>at
once.</hi> In God thou shalt meet with whatever thou <hi>hast</hi> Enjoyed, and wouldst fain
Enjoy <hi>again,</hi> with whatever Enjoyment thou hast <hi>fallen short</hi> of, and <hi>longest</hi> for.</p>
            <p>If there be Loss, Shame, Grief, or Evil, which thou wouldst fain have <hi>aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,</hi>
and to be as if it <hi>never</hi> had been. If thou wouldst have any Time past
brought back again; any Good, or Content, which hath been defac'd, or
stained, renew'd; thou shalt have this <hi>Abolishment</hi> of what thou wilt, this
<hi>Restitution</hi> of what thou wilt, in God. For <hi>He will give thee thy Hearts Desires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is <hi>All,</hi> if he be <hi>Alone.</hi> As He is in <hi>Himself,</hi> He is <hi>Infinite.</hi> If you add
any Thing to Him, or take Him cloath'd with any thing of the Creature; you
make Him <hi>Finite,</hi> and so loose <hi>Him quite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Joy from the <hi>Creature,</hi> which is a <hi>Confined</hi> Joy. If thy Joy be <hi>purely</hi>
from God; if it be from an <hi>Un-compounded Cause,</hi> it will be an <hi>Un-confined</hi> Joy.</p>
            <p>Search then, if thy Griefs encrease, as thou appliest Spiritual Comforts to
them; thou then dost but take <hi>something</hi> of God, as a <hi>New piece of Cloth;</hi>
and sowest that to the <hi>Old Garment</hi> of the Flesh, and Creature in thee; so the
<hi>Rent</hi> becomes worse. For if thou think to <hi>patch</hi> up that which is <hi>Thine,</hi> or the
<hi>Creatures,</hi> with that, which is <hi>Gods;</hi> He will tear more of it away and leave
thee still more Broken, and Naked.</p>
            <p>Let thy Heart go out of all Things into God, make Him thy Delight <hi>Alone,</hi>
and He will give thee <hi>All</hi> thy Desires.</p>
            <p>These are are the <hi>Motives</hi> to persuade you to the <hi>First Rule,</hi> to make God
in the <hi>Singleness</hi> of his own <hi>Person,</hi> your <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But now some one may say: Shall we so give our selves to look up to
God in <hi>Contemplation,</hi> as never to look down upon our own <hi>Conversation?</hi>
Shall we <hi>consider</hi> God only, and take no <hi>Care</hi> of our Selves? Shall we satisfy
our Selves to think, that <hi>God</hi> is most Holy, and most Excellent, though <hi>we</hi>
in the mean time be never so Sinful, and Vile? Is not this like Him, who
gazed upon the Stars, and fell into the <hi>Ditch?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> While we thus <hi>Object,</hi> we err, not knowing the <hi>Power of God,</hi>
nor the <hi>Way of the Spirit of Man.</hi> And this is my <hi>Two-fold Answer:</hi> the <hi>First,</hi>
from the <hi>Power of God;</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> from the <hi>Spirit of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Ans.</hi> From the <hi>Power of God.</hi> The <hi>Light</hi> of God is the <hi>Light of Life,</hi>
as <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> calls it. It is no <hi>Dead Light,</hi> it works, <hi>Transplanting</hi> the Soul
into the same <hi>Principle, Transforming</hi> the Soul into the same <hi>Image</hi> with itself.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Beams</hi> of the Sun have a <hi>Heat,</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> going along with their
<hi>Light:</hi> so have the <hi>Appearances</hi> of God to the Soul, a <hi>Fire</hi> in them, which
<hi>baptizeth</hi> it:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Discoveries <hi>of God carry the</hi> Spirit <hi>of God along with them, by which
those Excellencies of God</hi> are, <hi>and</hi> Act, <hi>wheresoever they</hi> Appear, <hi>according
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49838:84"/>
to the</hi> Manner, <hi>and</hi> Measure <hi>of their Appearance,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. Beholding
the Glory of the Lord, we are changed into the Likeness of the same Image, even
as by the Working of the same Spirit.</p>
            <p>To know thee, is Eternal Life; <hi>saith</hi> Iesus Christ <hi>to his</hi> Father, <hi>John</hi> 17. 3.
Spiritual Changes <hi>are made in</hi> Spiritual Contemplations. <hi>The</hi> Knowledge <hi>of God
is the</hi> Life <hi>of God in the Soul, which first brings forth itself in the</hi> Flower, <hi>and
then in the</hi> Fruit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was said under the</hi> Law; No man can see God, and live: <hi>that is</hi> in, <hi>or</hi> to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
But the</hi> Gospel <hi>saith:</hi> No man can see me, and lie dead in Sin, or Flesh, 1 <hi>John</hi>
2. 4. He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Liar.</p>
            <p>Look unto me, and be ye saved; <hi>saith God in the Prophet,</hi> Isa. 45. 22.
Sanctification, <hi>and</hi> Salvation, Holiness, <hi>and</hi> Ioy <hi>come</hi> down <hi>upon us when
we</hi> look up <hi>to God</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Ans.</hi> From the <hi>Spirit of Man.</hi> What is it <hi>Draws</hi> Man on to any Course?
Is it not some <hi>Image</hi> set up before the Eyes of His mind? What is it, which
<hi>Drives</hi> the Soul swiftly forward in any way? Is it not the <hi>Delight,</hi> which it
feels and enjoys?</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Our</hi> Saviour <hi>tells thee,</hi> Mat. 6. 22. The Light of the Body is the Eye:
if thine Eye be Single, thy whole Body shall be full of Light. <hi>Such as the</hi> Image
<hi>is, Which is in the</hi> Eye, <hi>such is the whole Man. If the Eye takes in One, Pure,
Simple</hi> Image <hi>of Him, who is</hi> One, <hi>who alone is</hi> Good; <hi>then is the Eye</hi> Single:
<hi>for it becomes</hi> One <hi>with this</hi> Image: <hi>Then is the</hi> whole Body Light. <hi>For every</hi>
Member <hi>is formed, and moved according to that</hi> Image.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Eye</hi> be Evil, taking in the <hi>Double,</hi> the <hi>Divided Image</hi> of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
then the whole Body is <hi>Dark;</hi> it is <hi>Uncertain, Confused, Distracted</hi> in all
<hi>its Members,</hi> and <hi>Motions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Misery</hi> of Men, that <hi>their Light is Darkness.</hi> They have no other
<hi>Images</hi> of Things before their Eyes, no Appearances of God in their <hi>Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi>
beside those of this World, and the Creature. This fills their Life with
all manner of Disorder.</p>
            <p>It were Happy for us, that we were always in the <hi>Contemplations</hi> of God,
that we had <hi>Him alone</hi> in all our Thoughts: so should the <hi>Eye</hi> of our Soul be
<hi>Single,</hi> and we should be ever carryed on towards that <hi>Single, Supream</hi> Good, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Him,</hi> as <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Eye,</hi> wherever it is; is the Highest <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Representative;</hi> the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<hi>Production, Habitation,</hi> and <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>let</hi> of the Superiour <hi>Principle,</hi> or <hi>Power:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Appearance</hi> is in the <hi>Eye;</hi> so are the <hi>Actings</hi> and <hi>Out-goings</hi> thorow
the whole <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same Word in Hebrew signifies the <hi>Eye,</hi> and a <hi>Fountain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Eye,</hi> and the <hi>Heart</hi> are the same Thing in Spirituals; having only this
different <hi>Notion;</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> is as the <hi>Principle</hi> in the <hi>Image;</hi> the <hi>Eye</hi> as the <hi>Image</hi>
in the <hi>Principle:</hi> the <hi>Heart</hi> as the <hi>Unity</hi> in the <hi>Variety;</hi> the <hi>Eye,</hi> as the <hi>Variety</hi> in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49838:85"/>
the <hi>Unity:</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> as the <hi>Father</hi> in the <hi>Son;</hi> the <hi>Eye,</hi> as the <hi>Son,</hi> which
hath the <hi>Father</hi> in the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return, thus you see, that it is the <hi>Image,</hi> which we have in our Minds,
which <hi>draws</hi> us to Good, or Evil.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>It is</hi> Delight, <hi>which</hi> drives <hi>us. This is the</hi> Oyl <hi>to the</hi> Wheels <hi>of our Soul.</hi>
The Ioy of the Lord is your Strength.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where your Treasure, there will your Hearts be:</hi> saith our Blessed Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi>
6. 21. That is a Mans <hi>Treasure,</hi> in which he hath <hi>Joy.</hi> O that we had less
<hi>Joy</hi> in the <hi>Creatures,</hi> and more in the <hi>Creator:</hi> then would our <hi>Treasure,</hi> and
<hi>Hearts</hi> be in <hi>Heaven!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cant. 1. 3. <hi>The</hi> Spouse <hi>saith to Jesus Christ:</hi> Thy Name is as an Ointment
poured forth: therefore do the Virgins love thee. <hi>See the</hi> Kindly, <hi>the Spiritual</hi>
Way <hi>of the Lord, with that Soul which he espouseth to Himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>He poureth</hi> forth his <hi>Name,</hi> the Discovery of his Person, and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in the Soul. He filleth the <hi>Eye</hi> of the Soul, the understanding of Man with
the Contemplation of His Riches, and Glories.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>This Name</hi> thus <hi>poured out</hi> becomes as an <hi>Ointment</hi> in the Soul. It <hi>perfumes</hi>
the Spirit. It spreads a Strong, Delicate <hi>Sweetness,</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi> thorow the
<hi>Heart,</hi> and <hi>Affections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>This Perfume</hi> of Delight makes the Soul in <hi>Love</hi> with Jesus Christ,
makes her full of <hi>Longings</hi> after him, of <hi>Breathings,</hi> and <hi>Cries</hi> to be taken up
into <hi>Communion</hi> with Him, and made more <hi>Conformable</hi> to Him.</p>
            <p>Thus, as the <hi>Contemplations</hi> of God <hi>draw</hi> the Soul, so a <hi>Complacency,</hi> and
Joy in God <hi>drive</hi> her on to <hi>Believe, Love, Obey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this is according to the</hi> Natural Way <hi>of the</hi> Spirit <hi>of Man. The</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
informs <hi>the</hi> Understanding, <hi>the</hi> Understanding moves <hi>the</hi> Will, <hi>and</hi> Affections,
<hi>these put the</hi> Whole Man <hi>into</hi> Action.</p>
            <p>O then fear not any <hi>Danger</hi> in <hi>Delighting</hi> your selves in the Excellencies of
God, as he is <hi>Naked</hi> in himself. If you be not <hi>Good,</hi> this <hi>Joy</hi> will make you
<hi>Such.</hi> If you be <hi>Good,</hi> this <hi>Joy</hi> will make you <hi>Better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for this <hi>Objection;</hi> and the <hi>First Rule</hi> for the <hi>Removal</hi> of the <hi>Second
Mistake,</hi> by which we are apt to look into our <hi>Selves</hi> for the <hi>Ground</hi> of our <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Rule: Take the Rise of your Ioy from Iesus Christ; not, as he Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates
Himself to you; but, as he Comprehends you in Himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>expresseth this</hi> Distinction, <hi>and</hi> Rule <hi>in the</hi> Life, <hi>in his own</hi> Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
2 Corin. 12. 2. <hi>He tells us of a</hi> Man in Christ, caught up to the Third
Heaven. <hi>v.</hi> 3. Such a Man Paul knew. <hi>v. 4. This Man</hi> heard Un-utterable
Words in Paradise. <hi>v.</hi> 5, Of such a One, <hi>saith St.</hi> Paul, I will glory.</p>
            <p>Three <hi>Distinct Persons</hi> are mentioned in this Discourse. Yet all these <hi>Three</hi>
prove <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. First, <hi>here is the</hi> Person <hi>of</hi> Christ, <hi>as it is in the</hi> Third Heaven. <hi>The</hi> First
Heaven <hi>is the</hi> Starry Heaven: <hi>For so we read: He</hi> called the Firmament Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49838:85"/>
               <hi>Gen. 1. 8. The nature of</hi> Angels <hi>makes the</hi> Second Heaven. <hi>So we
read,</hi> Gen. 21. 17. The Angel of God called to <hi>Hagar</hi> out of Heaven, <hi>and
they are called</hi> The Angels of Heaven. <hi>The</hi> Third Heaven <hi>seems to be the</hi>
Natural Image, <hi>and</hi> Presence <hi>of God, as he is the head of Angels. This is
called</hi> The face of God, <hi>Psal. 42. 2. Mat.</hi> 18. 10.</p>
            <p>In this Heavenly appearance was <hi>Paradise,</hi> the flourishing State of all the
Creatures in the <hi>Divine Image.</hi> This <hi>Image</hi> was withdrawn at the fall, and
not brought forth again in its own <hi>naked</hi> Appearance till Jesus Christ brought
it forth to Light, after a <hi>Spiritual</hi> manner, in His own <hi>Person,</hi> by His <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
from the Dead.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, <hi>here is the</hi> Person <hi>of St.</hi> Paul, <hi>as it is</hi> wholly Spiritual, <hi>in</hi>
Union <hi>with the</hi> Person <hi>of</hi> Christ; Comprehended <hi>in</hi> One <hi>Spirit; Ascending, and</hi>
Caught <hi>up into</hi> One <hi>Glory, with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here is the <hi>Person</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as it is a <hi>Mixt Person,</hi> partly
<hi>Spiritual,</hi> partly <hi>Natural.</hi> This <hi>Man,</hi> as he was <hi>spiritual,</hi> had a fellowship
with the <hi>Man</hi> in Glory, knew him, did bear that <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Impression</hi> of those
<hi>Words</hi> which were spoken, and those <hi>Glories,</hi> which were seen in <hi>Paradise.</hi>
But as he was <hi>Natural,</hi> so he could not <hi>Utter</hi> those <hi>Heavenly Words,</hi> nor <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand</hi>
that <hi>State,</hi> whether it were the Last Resurrection to the <hi>Glory</hi> of the
<hi>Body;</hi> or the first Entrance, and Abod of the <hi>Soul naked</hi> in Glory, at
Death.</p>
            <p>Of such an one I will Glory, <hi>saith St.</hi> Paul: v. 5. <hi>that is of the</hi> Heavenly
Man, <hi>the</hi> Man of Paradise, <hi>that is, of the</hi> Natural <hi>Man, as it is</hi> caught <hi>up
into the</hi> Spiritual <hi>Man; of the</hi> Spiritual <hi>Man, as it is</hi> Comprehended <hi>in Christ,
and together with</hi> Him caught <hi>up into</hi> Paradise.</p>
            <p>Thou mayest Joy, and Glory in that <hi>Man,</hi> that <hi>Self</hi> only, which is above
a <hi>Man,</hi> above thy self. which is compleat in Christ, as Christ is compleat in
the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Such a One</hi> I will Glory, saith St. <hi>Paul:</hi> that is, of <hi>that Man,</hi> whose
<hi>Resemblance,</hi> and Likeness I saw, and was taken up, and transfigured into
it, when I had that <hi>Revelation</hi> fourteen years ago.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But of my self,</hi> saith he, <hi>I will not boast.</hi> He calls <hi>himself,</hi> the Man in
that <hi>Mixt State,</hi> in which he now was on Earth, having the <hi>Power of Christ
made manifest in his Weakness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Rule</hi> hath <hi>two Parts</hi> in it. One is <hi>Negative,</hi> the Other is <hi>Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Part, <hi>The</hi> First <hi>is the</hi> Negative Part <hi>of this</hi> Rule, <hi>which is This:</hi> Take
not the Rise of your Ioy from Iesus Christ, as he communicates Himself to you
on Earth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Communications</hi> of Christ to us in the <hi>Natural Man,</hi> are,
<list>
                  <item>1. Uncertain.</item>
                  <item>2. Imperfect.</item>
                  <item>3. Unsatisfactory.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Un-safe</hi> for an Object of Joy.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:49838:86"/>
1. <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Communications</hi> of Christ in our <hi>Natural Man</hi> are <hi>Uncertain.</hi>
They are like the Shining of the Sun upon the Earth, which is ever and anon
cut off by a Cloud comi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g between the Earth, and the Sun. So <hi>Sins, Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Desertions</hi> make the <hi>Breakings forth</hi> of Christ upon <hi>Us Fleeting,</hi> and <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> complains of his <hi>Father forsaking Him.</hi> Neither is there any
Member of <hi>Christ</hi> that lives in the Body, which doth not often find cause to
grieve for the <hi>Withdrawings</hi> of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Psalms</hi> are the <hi>Discovery,</hi> and <hi>History</hi> of a Holy Soul in her whole
<hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urse,</hi> and in all her <hi>Tempers.</hi> How often have ye there Sad mention made of
<hi>Gods hiding his Face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thou take thy <hi>Joy</hi> no higher, than from the <hi>Puttings forth</hi> of Christ in
thee, thou wilt be very <hi>Wavering,</hi> and <hi>Unconstant</hi> in all thy Comforts. Thou
canst have no <hi>Sure,</hi> or <hi>Setled Joy</hi> this way. Thou wilt be able to bear no
<hi>Tryal,</hi> when thou shalt be carried thorow the <hi>Waters</hi> of Darkness, and Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thorow the <hi>Fires</hi> of Terrour, and burning Tribulation. The Strength
of thy Joy will be <hi>Small,</hi> and thou wilt <hi>faint in the Day</hi> of Adversity.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, The <hi>Communications</hi> of Christ in our <hi>Flesh</hi> are <hi>Imperfect.</hi>
They are Imperfect <hi>Two ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In Degree.</item>
               <item>2. By Mixture.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. In Degree. <hi>All our</hi> Graces <hi>are thus</hi> Imperfect, <hi>while we are in</hi> This World.
I count not my Self to have apprehended; <hi>saith</hi> St. Paul Phil 3. 13. I press towards
the Mark. <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>While you look upon your <hi>Graces</hi> for <hi>Comfort,</hi> you can never have a <hi>Full
Joy,</hi> because you have no <hi>Grace,</hi> which doth not in <hi>Many Degrees</hi> fall short
of the <hi>Mark</hi> in Jesus Christ, the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, to which ye are called.</p>
            <p>He that takes his <hi>Joy</hi> from the <hi>Manifestations</hi> of Christ in his <hi>Flesh,</hi> is like
him, that feeds upon <hi>U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ripe Fruit,</hi> which hath a <hi>Sowrness</hi> in the Taste, and a
<hi>Wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rishness</hi> in the Nourishment. So will this Man have a <hi>Bitterness</hi> and <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
in his Dearest Comforts.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>By Mixture.</hi> This is a <hi>Second Way</hi> in which the <hi>Graces</hi> of Christ are
<hi>Imperfect</hi> in us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21. St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains: <hi>I find a Law, that when I would do Good,
Evil is present with me.</hi> How many sad <hi>Throws</hi> have we, how near are we
brought to <hi>Despair</hi> full many a Time, when we go to <hi>derive</hi> our Joys, from
what we can <hi>discover</hi> of Jesus Christ <hi>in us?</hi> If we pitch our Thoughts upon
<hi>Faith, Love, Obedience, Humility, Heavenly-Mindedness;</hi> we find these only, as
<hi>Wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Inclinations</hi> in us: <hi>We would do good;</hi> But then <hi>Evil is present with us.</hi>
At the same time like <hi>Satan</hi> in the midst of the Sons of God, <hi>Unbelief, Lust,
Hatred, Pride, Worldliness</hi> appear together with our <hi>Graces,</hi> and so <hi>mingled</hi> with
them, that it becomes very difficult to determine, which is the <hi>Son,</hi> that is to
abide in the heart; and which the <hi>Servant,</hi> that is to be cast out; which is the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49838:86"/>
               <hi>True, Predominant Principle</hi> in the Soul, and which is a <hi>Temporary Appearance</hi>
only. Who can tell, which are from the proper <hi>Will</hi> of the Soul, as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the <hi>Husband;</hi> which are from <hi>Violence,</hi> as begotten by a Ravisher?</p>
            <p>This <hi>Mixture</hi> in thee will make that <hi>Joy,</hi> which depends upon any Thing in
thy self, a <hi>Mixt Thing</hi> of <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Fear;</hi> of <hi>Pain,</hi> and <hi>Pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thy <hi>Life</hi> will be like an <hi>April day;</hi> which hath far more <hi>Showers</hi> than <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shines</hi>
in it. Thou wilt far oftner with <hi>Paul</hi> cry; <hi>O wretched Man!</hi> than say
with him; <hi>I bless God:</hi> Rom. 7. 24.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Hand,</hi> that gathers a <hi>Rose</hi> in the midst of <hi>Thorns:</hi> so will thy <hi>Heart</hi>
be, while it gathers its Joys from the <hi>Beauty</hi> of Christ growing up in <hi>itself.</hi> If
it do reach any <hi>Sweetness,</hi> it will have with it many a sharp, and Bloody
<hi>Scratch</hi> from its <hi>Corruptions,</hi> as from <hi>Thorns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, <hi>The</hi> Puttings forth <hi>of Christ in us are</hi> Unsatisfactory. This One thing
I do, <hi>saith the</hi> Apostle, forgetting those things which are behind; I reach for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
towards that which is before. <hi>What is that? Observe, the next verse will
tell us:</hi> The Mark of the price of the High Calling of God in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>That which is <hi>come forth</hi> of Christ into thy <hi>Natural Man;</hi> that is now <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind</hi>
thee. That which is <hi>Before</hi> thee is, the <hi>Person, Possession,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> of Jesus
Christ in the Spirit, and Glory of God. The <hi>Unity</hi> of this <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Fellowship</hi>
of this <hi>Glory,</hi> as it is <hi>in the Person</hi> of Christ: this is <hi>That Mark</hi> which is <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> us.</p>
            <p>All that, which is in our <hi>Persons,</hi> while we are in <hi>Flesh,</hi> is <hi>Behind</hi> us, and to
be forgotten by us. It hath a <hi>Darkness,</hi> a <hi>Shadowyness,</hi> an <hi>Emptiness,</hi> a <hi>Transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness</hi>
from the <hi>Flesh,</hi> in which it is inclosed. So it cannot <hi>stay</hi> with us, or <hi>satisfie</hi>
us. It cannot <hi>hold</hi> us. It vanisheth, it passeth <hi>behind</hi> us, and is to be <hi>forgotten</hi> by
us.</p>
            <p>Our best Things, while we are in this vile Body, are a <hi>Heavenly Treasure in
an Earthen Vessel,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks. They are <hi>Pure,</hi> and <hi>Sweet,</hi> as they flow
from the Spirit of Christ, but as they are in our Spirits, they tast of the <hi>Vessel,</hi>
they receive an <hi>Unsavouriness,</hi> or <hi>Unsatisfactoriness</hi> from their Communion with
our <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in thee, is like a <hi>Beam,</hi> which is at once in the <hi>Bosom</hi> of
the <hi>Sun,</hi> and in the <hi>Bosom</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> That End of the Beam which is to the
<hi>Sun,</hi> is <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Light: But that which is towards the Earth, is <hi>Dim,</hi>
full of <hi>Motes,</hi> and <hi>Dust.</hi> The <hi>Shinings forth</hi> of Christ in thee, have such a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Relation, to Christ,</hi> and <hi>to thee.</hi> As they are <hi>Christs,</hi> and in Union with him,
they are <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> in Christ, without any <hi>Emptiness</hi> or <hi>Mixture.</hi> But as
they are <hi>Thine,</hi> and have their Being in thy Heart, they are like <hi>Gold</hi> in the
<hi>Mine,</hi> partaking very much of the <hi>Earth,</hi> in the midst of which they lie.</p>
            <p>The Power of Christ magnifies it self in thy Weakness: <hi>as the</hi> Apostle <hi>speaketh
of Himself. The Life of Christ in</hi> thy Spirit, <hi>is</hi> Wine <hi>mingled with</hi> Water. <hi>If
thou take it</hi> in itself, <hi>and</hi> in Christ, <hi>it is the</hi> Power of Christ. <hi>But if you look
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49838:87"/>
upon it, as it is in</hi> your Spirit, <hi>it is</hi> Wine <hi>and</hi> Water, Power <hi>in</hi> Weakness. <hi>On
Christ's</hi> part <hi>it is</hi> Magnified, <hi>but on thy</hi> part <hi>it is</hi> Weak, <hi>and can afford thee
but a</hi> Weak, Unsatisfying <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and <hi>Lastly,</hi> The <hi>Communications</hi> of Christ in us become <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe,</hi>
when we build our Joys upon Them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> is ever very careful in this
One Main Point; when he rejoyceth at any time in the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, to set
aside <hi>his own Person,</hi> and to set up that <hi>Grace</hi> in <hi>the Person</hi> of <hi>Christ. I thank
God thorow Jesus Christ my Lord:</hi> Rom. 7. 1. What ever <hi>matter</hi> of Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
or Thankfulness a holy Soul finds, it still finds, and acknowledges <hi>it</hi> to
have all <hi>its Vertue,</hi> Sufficiency, and Safety <hi>from,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> the <hi>Person</hi> of Jesus Christ.
Therefore doth it draw all <hi>through that Person</hi> out of its <hi>own Person,</hi> lest it
should think of <hi>it self</hi> above what is meet.</p>
            <p>Look to Jesus Christ the <hi>Beginner,</hi> and <hi>Finisher</hi> of thy Faith, and Joy. For
God hath appointed Him, as the <hi>Mediator,</hi> in whose <hi>Person</hi> alone every Thing
is made truly <hi>Acceptable</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Man:</hi> He alone must be thy <hi>Beloved,
in whom</hi> thou must be <hi>well-pleased.</hi> Thou must be <hi>well-pleased</hi> and Joy'd with
every <hi>Grace,</hi> onely <hi>in Him,</hi> as <hi>Thou,</hi> and <hi>It</hi> meet <hi>in him.</hi> Otherwise thou art in
danger of Spiritual <hi>Adultery,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> by which thou wilt grieve thy
<hi>Husband</hi> the Lord Jesus, and rob thy self of his blessed Presence.</p>
            <p>This is a <hi>Way</hi> by which thy Soul often falls on a sudden from <hi>High Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
into a <hi>Dark,</hi> and <hi>Desolate</hi> Condition.</p>
            <p>When the Lord Jesus fills thee with the <hi>Warmth,</hi> and <hi>fruitfulness</hi> of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
<hi>first</hi> thou lookest upon the <hi>Fruits</hi> of Christ in thy Soul, and art exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
taken with the <hi>Beauty,</hi> and <hi>Sweetness</hi> of these. Now thy <hi>Heart,</hi> and
thine <hi>Eye</hi> begin to go a <hi>whoring</hi> from thy Heavenly Spouse, when they begin
to look <hi>off</hi> from his <hi>Person,</hi> though it be <hi>upon</hi> something sent forth <hi>from Him.
Secondly,</hi> thou then reflectest upon thy self with Delight, to see thy <hi>self</hi> so <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned,</hi>
so <hi>strengthened.</hi> Thou thinkest thy self <hi>Rich,</hi> and <hi>Safe.</hi> So ere thou art
aware, thy <hi>Soul</hi> makes her self like that <hi>Whore,</hi> which said, <hi>I sit like a Queen,
and shall see no sorrow. Thirdly,</hi> Thy <hi>Saviour</hi> now grows <hi>Jealous,</hi> He turns
away his <hi>Face,</hi> He withdraws his <hi>Graces,</hi> the Testimonies of his Presence from
thee, He leaves thee to the Power of Temptations, and Lusts. This he doth,
that thou mayst learn not to <hi>Exalt thy self by his Gifts,</hi> nor <hi>His Gifts in thy Self;</hi>
but <hi>Both in him,</hi> whose <hi>Person</hi> is the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Both,</hi> and ought to be the <hi>Only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
of all thy <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Apostle had the <hi>Buffetings</hi> of Satan, and a <hi>Sting</hi> in his Heart, that
<hi>he</hi> might not be exalted by his <hi>Revelations,</hi> but <hi>his Saviour,</hi> and <hi>he</hi> only <hi>in his
Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take heed then of looking upon the most <hi>Glorious Graces</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in your
<hi>own Person.</hi> But keep your Eye unmoved on the <hi>Person</hi> of your <hi>Saviour,</hi> and
look upon <hi>Both, your Self,</hi> and <hi>your Graces</hi> in that <hi>true Glass,</hi> and <hi>perfect Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So I pass from the <hi>Negative</hi> to the <hi>Affirmative Part</hi> of this <hi>Rule.</hi>
            </p>

2. Part, Take the Rise of your Ioy from Iesus Christ, as He comprehends
you in Himself.</p>
            <p>It is necessary for me here to make plain this <hi>Rule,</hi> by Propounding, and
Answering <hi>Three Questions,</hi> which perhaps most of your Spirits will be ready
to <hi>ask</hi> in themselves.</p>
            <p>1. Question. First <hi>you may</hi> ask <hi>me,</hi> What I mean by Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> I shall answer so far only, as I apprehend most pertinent to the
<hi>Point</hi> in hand.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Answer</hi> to this Question shall be Six-fold.</p>
            <p>1. Answer. <hi>Our</hi> Lord Iesus <hi>is a</hi> Spirit, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 4. The Lord is that Spirit.
<hi>A</hi> Spirit <hi>hath a</hi> Three-fold Power.</p>

            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Power, Penetrating.</hi> When <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was made <hi>Spiritual</hi> by his Resu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
He could pass thorow the <hi>Door,</hi> when it was <hi>shut,</hi> and present himself
in the midst of the Room, and the Disciples on a sudden.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Bodily</hi> Substances are forc'd to remain one <hi>without</hi> another. They <hi>touch</hi>
and joyn only by their <hi>Out-sides.</hi> They cannot mingle, but by <hi>Breaking</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into little pieces. So the <hi>Golden Calf</hi> was stampt to Powder, that it might
<hi>mix</hi> itself with the <hi>Waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is the Excellent Nature of <hi>Spirits,</hi> that they can be a <hi>whole Army</hi>
of them in <hi>One Spirit,</hi> or in the <hi>Body</hi> of any Creature, passing into the very
<hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> of it, most <hi>Inwardly,</hi> most <hi>Universally;</hi> and yet neither <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide,</hi>
nor <hi>Stretch</hi> it.</p>
            <p>The Lord was in this manner present with His Ten Thousand Thousands
of His Angels on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which was a <hi>Bodily</hi> Substance, that might be
touched.</p>
            <p>So the Lord, and all the Angels, and all the Spirits of Just men; the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Assembly of all Glorious Spirits meet on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> that
cannot be toucht with hands.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Person</hi> of thy Saviour is such a <hi>Spiritual Substance.</hi> He can come into
thy <hi>Closet,</hi> thy <hi>Bosom,</hi> thy <hi>Heart.</hi> He can dwell in the <hi>same Body,</hi> in the <hi>same Soul</hi>
with thee, in the most <hi>Inward Parts,</hi> in <hi>every Part</hi> of <hi>Both;</hi> and yet take up
no more <hi>Room.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Word,</hi> which is <hi>Christ,</hi> is within thee, even in thy <hi>Heart,</hi> and in thy
<hi>Mouth;</hi> in the most <hi>Inward,</hi> and most <hi>Outward</hi> Part. <hi>All</hi> of Man, and every
Creature is either <hi>Heart,</hi> or <hi>Mouth;</hi> an <hi>Indrawing,</hi> or an <hi>Out-driving Power;</hi>
the <hi>Inward Principle,</hi> or the <hi>Out-ward Appearance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour divides the whole Man into <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> when He tells
us; that <hi>Nothing, which enters into the Mouth, defiles a Man; but that which
comes forth from the Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is a <hi>Spirit</hi> in thy <hi>Heart,</hi> and in thy <hi>Mouth.</hi> He <hi>pierceth</hi> to the
<hi>Bottom</hi> of the most <hi>Secret Principle</hi> of Life, and Being in thee. He is as <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:49838:88"/>
with <hi>That,</hi> and <hi>Thee,</hi> as <hi>That</hi> is with <hi>Thee.</hi> He <hi>passeth</hi> quite <hi>through,</hi> all
<hi>over</hi> the Bredth, and Length of that <hi>Body,</hi> that <hi>Appearance,</hi> in which thou
walkest. He makes it <hi>His Clothing,</hi> as it is <hi>Thine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Power</hi> of a <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Power, Receiving. <hi>A</hi> Spirit receives <hi>other Things into self,</hi> as Inwardly,
as Entirely, as <hi>It</hi> conveys <hi>itself into Them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read of the <hi>Depths of Satan,</hi> Rev. 2. 24. of the <hi>Deep Things of God,</hi>
1 Cor. 2. 10.</p>
            <p>We read of a <hi>Pit</hi> for the <hi>Devil,</hi> which can be no other than a <hi>Spirit of
Darkness,</hi> and <hi>Wrath</hi> in <hi>himself</hi> or in <hi>God:</hi> Rev. 20. 3.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>Chambers</hi> for the <hi>Saints:</hi> Es. 26. of a <hi>House,</hi> and <hi>Mansions</hi>
for them above; which can be no other than <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> in
God.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Spirit</hi> hath an <hi>Opening,</hi> and a <hi>Depth</hi> in itself, into which it can receive
all things without any Breach in it self.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> hath its <hi>Pit,</hi> into which it taketh in, and swalloweth up,
whatever it taketh hold of.</p>
            <p>A Good Spirit hath its <hi>Chambers,</hi> and <hi>Mansions,</hi> its <hi>Retreats,</hi> and <hi>Abodes</hi> in
it self, for what Guests it pleaseth to admit, or draw in.</p>
            <p>Abide in me, <hi>saith</hi> Iesus Christ <hi>to his Disciples,</hi> Iob. 15. 4. <hi>As every Thing
may be a</hi> Temple <hi>to a</hi> Spirit. Your Bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghost: 1 Cor.
6. 19. <hi>As a Saint is the</hi> Temple <hi>of Christ; So a</hi> Spirit <hi>may be a</hi> Temple <hi>to any
Thing: So the</hi> Lord Iesus <hi>is a</hi> Temple, <hi>into which the</hi> Saints <hi>may at all times
enter, and have Communion with God.</hi> Destroy this Temple, and in three days I
will build it again. This he spoke of his Body, <hi>John</hi> 2. 21.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Body</hi> of Christ was a Temple shut up with a <hi>Vail</hi> before it, while it
was <hi>Natural.</hi> But when it was made <hi>Spiritual</hi> by the Resurrection; it was the
<hi>most Holy place</hi> set open for thee to come into it, and never to go out more:
<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 1, 3, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Flesh is</hi> a mere <hi>Shadow,</hi> which can only <hi>touch</hi> upon Things, but can <hi>take in</hi>
Nothing. A <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Life,</hi> and hath a Depth in it, for which it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to <hi>Water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Second Power</hi> of a <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Power, Uniting.</hi> The Spirit is the Band of Unity. 'Tis true of every
Spirit, so far as it hath the Nature of a Spirit in it. <hi>Bodies</hi> in <hi>Flesh,</hi> are <hi>Divided,</hi>
and <hi>Broken</hi> things, being held together only so far, as they are <hi>Bound</hi> up in <hi>One
Spirit. Bodies</hi> in <hi>Flesh</hi> converse with all things at a <hi>Distance,</hi> in a <hi>Divided</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Our Saviour is said to take away the <hi>Wall of Partition</hi> in his own Flesh,
when he crucified the <hi>Flesh</hi> in himself, for <hi>Himself,</hi> and the <hi>whole World,</hi> Eph.
2. 14.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Spirit</hi> is Uncapable of <hi>Division,</hi> being <hi>One</hi> in it self, and making all things
<hi>One</hi> with it, which it takes in, or converses with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:49838:88"/>
               <hi>Spirits</hi> are compared to <hi>Flames:</hi> Heb. 1. As <hi>Flames</hi> they <hi>lick</hi> up into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and <hi>Incorporate</hi> (as it were) with themselves, whatever they light upon,
or work upon.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Power</hi> which caught up <hi>Eliah</hi> was represented by <hi>a Chariot</hi> of <hi>Fire.</hi>
It was, as a <hi>Chariot,</hi> because it took him <hi>into</hi> it self. It was a <hi>Fire,</hi> because it
took him up into the Fellowship of <hi>One</hi> Life, Glory, and Spirit with it self.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Answer</hi> to that <hi>Question,</hi> which asketh, <hi>What we understand
by the Person of Christ,</hi> when we speak of his <hi>comprehending</hi> us.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Answer: Christ</hi> is the <hi>Highest Spirit. He is Lord of all.</hi> We read 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.
the last words thus; <hi>the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> It is in <hi>Greek, the Spirit the Lord.
Jesus Christ</hi> is the supreme Spirit, that Spirit, which is Lord of All.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Majesty</hi> of our Saviour's Person consists in this, that he is that <hi>Spirit</hi>
which hath the most <hi>Absolute Power</hi> over all Spirits, Persons, and Things;
together with the most comprehensive Greatness.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Spirit</hi> is like a <hi>Prospect,</hi> the <hi>Higher</hi> it is, the more <hi>Commanding,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive</hi>
it is.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Answer. Christ</hi> is the <hi>Brightest Spirit.</hi> He is the <hi>Brightness</hi> of the Father's
<hi>Glory:</hi> Heb. 1. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Out-shining.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the <hi>Effusion of Beams</hi> from the Godhead, is <hi>through</hi> the Person of Christ.
All the <hi>Beams</hi> meet within the Compass of that Person.</p>
            <p>We before cited a Place of Scripture, which calls the <hi>Spirit, A Band of
Unity.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is that <hi>Spirit,</hi> in which all the <hi>Goings forth</hi> of the God-head
are united, as a <hi>Knot of Beams,</hi> a <hi>Band,</hi> a <hi>Bundle</hi> of <hi>Divine Irradiations,</hi> or
<hi>Manifestations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Blessed <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> is the Highest, the clearest Light, which as
a <hi>Garden-bed,</hi> discloseth, and exposeth all things to view, in the most natural,
naked, and distinct manner. This is the <hi>Word,</hi> which being <hi>spoken,</hi> all things
are <hi>exprest.</hi> Heb. 4. 12, 13. <hi>The Word of God is lively: All things are naked
and bare before him, with whom we have to do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Answer. <hi>The</hi> Person <hi>of</hi> Christ <hi>is the</hi> First, <hi>and</hi> Fountain-Spirit. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Adam <hi>is a</hi> Quickning Spirit, <hi>a</hi> Life-giving, <hi>or</hi> Life-making <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All <hi>Spirits, Persons,</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> that <hi>have</hi> Life, or <hi>are from</hi> Life: they are in
this <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Waters</hi> in their <hi>Fountain.</hi> They are in Him <hi>Primarily,</hi> and <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently.</hi>
They are in Him, <hi>more truly,</hi> than they are in themselves. For they
<hi>derive</hi> that, which they are <hi>in themselves, from Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Answer. Christ is the Image of God: <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. He is the Image of the
Invisible God.</p>
            <p>But you may say, that every thing is an <hi>Image</hi> of God one way or another.
It is true; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that the <hi>Invisible things of God, are made manifest
by the things that are made.</hi> Rom. 1. 20.</p>
            <p>Therefore the meaning of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in that other place is, that He is
<hi>the Image,</hi> the <hi>Full Image,</hi> the <hi>Proper,</hi> the <hi>Perfect Image of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:49838:89"/>
All the <hi>Workings,</hi> and <hi>Manifestations</hi> of God are in this <hi>Blessed Spirit;</hi> and
that according to their <hi>several States,</hi> with their <hi>Proper Distinctions:</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the <hi>Image</hi> were <hi>Imperfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the <hi>Discoveries</hi> of God are in this <hi>Person,</hi> as <hi>One</hi> with it. For all make
<hi>One Image,</hi> and that a <hi>Spiritual Image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus this <hi>Image</hi> is, as it were a <hi>Body</hi> to the God-Head. All the <hi>Vertues, Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi>
and <hi>Appearances</hi> of God are contained in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as <hi>One Body.</hi> Yet
every One hath his own Distinct <hi>Place, Power, Form, Activity, Enjoyment;</hi> as
<hi>Diverse Members. The Fulness of the God-Head dwelleth in Him Bodily, Colos.</hi>
2. 9.</p>
            <p>6. Answer. Iesus Christ is the Head-Spirit. God hath made Him the Head
of All, Ephes. 1. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our</hi> Saviour <hi>is the</hi> Universal Spirit, <hi>that takes in all, and unites all in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
It pleaseth the Father, that all Fulness should dwell in Him, Coloss. 1. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He is a</hi> Particular Spirit, <hi>distinct from all.</hi> For God hath given Him a Name
above every Name which is named in this world, and that which is to come,
Ephes. 1. 21. <hi>Thus He is the</hi> Head.</p>
            <p>Thus our <hi>Saviour</hi> becomes a Person, that both <hi>Represents,</hi> and <hi>Presents</hi> all
in Himself: that both <hi>Perfects</hi> all in Himself, and Himself <hi>bears</hi> the <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
Sufferings <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>for</hi> all.</p>
            <p>I have now answered the <hi>First Question, what I understand by Jesus Christ:</hi>
not according to the Exactness, or Latitude of the Question, but so far, as
tends to my present purpose, and the making plain of the <hi>Second Question,</hi>
which follows.</p>
            <p>2. Question: How we are said to be Comprehended in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>I shall indeavour to open the Nature of this, which is one of the most Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
Spiritual, Profitable, Comfortable, and yet Difficult Points in all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.
I shall proceed in the opening of it by a <hi>Three-fold Step,</hi> which shall be
a <hi>Three-fold Answer</hi> to the <hi>Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> comprehends us <hi>Spiritually, Mystically, Eternally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Answer.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> comprehends us <hi>Spiritually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Blessed Saviour,</hi> as a Spirit, <hi>comprehends us in Himself,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 45.
The last Adam was made a Quickness Spirit. Iesus Christ <hi>is the</hi> Second Adam,
<hi>a</hi> Universal Person, comprehending <hi>the Second Creation, in His</hi> Spiritual <hi>Person,
in the</hi> Spirituality <hi>of His Nature. He is the</hi> Heavenly Adam, a Collection <hi>of
all the Saints, as He is a</hi> Spirit.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ comprehends us <hi>by the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 13. <hi>By one Spirit
we are all Baptized into one Body.</hi> Christ, and we live both in One Spirit, so we
are <hi>Both</hi> bound up in <hi>One.</hi> It is the <hi>Unity of the Spirit, Ephes.</hi> 4. 4. The
<hi>Spirit is Christs Radically,</hi> and Primitively, by drawings us down, and <hi>Baptizing</hi>
us into this Spirit, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> comprehends us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord Jesus comprehends thee,</hi> as thou art a Spirit. He that is joyned to
the Lord is One Spirit, 1 Corin. 6. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:49838:89"/>
Our Saviour, and Husband comprehends us <hi>Inwardly, Powerfully, Fully:</hi> not
as <hi>Bodies, Waters, Flames,</hi> but as <hi>Spirits</hi> comprehend one another, nay as One
Spirit, as the Highest Spirit comprehends itself.</p>
            <p>Christ comprehends thee, as Spirit of <hi>His</hi> Spirit, as a Spirit <hi>in His</hi> Spirit, as
<hi>One Spirit,</hi> as the <hi>Self-Image</hi> of Himself.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Answer:</hi> The <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> comprehends us <hi>Mystically.</hi> The <hi>Mystical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
lies in Three Things, in the <hi>Glory,</hi> or <hi>Diviness</hi> of the Union; in the <hi>Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of it; in the <hi>Distinctness</hi> preserved together with the <hi>Oneness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are comprehended in Christ <hi>Mystically,</hi> because <hi>Incomprehensibly.</hi> The
<hi>Love</hi> of Christ <hi>passeth Knowledge, Ephes.</hi> 3. 19. That <hi>Love,</hi> which is an <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
only, and <hi>loves</hi> by <hi>Impression,</hi> and <hi>unites</hi> by <hi>Imagination;</hi> such a <hi>Love</hi>
may be taken in by <hi>Knowledge</hi> only, which is a Notion, the taking of a <hi>Picture</hi>
the Catching of a <hi>Shadow.</hi> Such a <hi>Love</hi> may be known by the <hi>Understanding,</hi>
which is a <hi>Faculty,</hi> an <hi>Accident.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is above <hi>Affections,</hi> and <hi>Impressions.</hi> It is a Naked
Comprehension of <hi>Substances,</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> in a <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi>
So it <hi>passeth knowledge,</hi> not being to be <hi>represented</hi> by any <hi>Image,</hi> or <hi>Notion;</hi>
not to be <hi>conceived</hi> by any <hi>Faculty;</hi> but to be <hi>Felt,</hi> and <hi>Enjoyed</hi> only, after an
Immediate, and unconceivable manner.</p>
            <p>We are comprehended in Christ <hi>Mystically,</hi> because with an Appearance of
<hi>Contrariety</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are <hi>One Spirit,</hi> and <hi>One Body</hi> in Christ. The <hi>Body</hi> of Christ in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of it is a Spirit. The <hi>Spirit</hi> of Christ in the <hi>Variety</hi> of it, is a <hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are comprehended in <hi>Christ,</hi> as <hi>Members</hi> in the Body. Each Saint hath
his <hi>Distinct Person,</hi> Place, <hi>Power, Appearance:</hi> I say <hi>Distinct</hi> both from the
<hi>Person</hi> of Christ, as the <hi>Head,</hi> and from all the other Saints, as <hi>Particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet again each <hi>Member</hi> is <hi>One Man</hi> with <hi>Christ,</hi> possessing the <hi>Fulness</hi> of
God, and of the whole Body, being in itself <hi>conformed</hi> to the Image of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Answer: <hi>The Third and Last Answer to this</hi> Question <hi>is, that we are
Comprehended in Christ</hi> Eternally, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. Who hath saved us, and
called us, &amp;c. according to his own Purpose, and Grace, which was given us in
Christ, before the World began. <hi>v.</hi> 10. But is now made manifest by the Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Three Things</hi> lie clear in these words.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> Thy Person was in Christ from Eternity. Thou hadst a <hi>Capacity,</hi>
and a <hi>Subsistence</hi> in thy Saviour, <hi>before the World began.</hi> For thou wert then in
Him, as a <hi>Subject,</hi> on which the Father setled his <hi>Purpose,</hi> and confer'd his
<hi>Grace:</hi> The words of the Apostle are: <hi>Grace given us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thy Person with all manner of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> was in Christ
before all Times, as it is or shall be in any Time. For One is the <hi>Measure</hi> of

afterwards, <hi>according</hi> to <hi>That,</hi> is <hi>This</hi> exactly fashioned, <hi>who hath called and

            <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That State of our Persons comprehended in Christ is <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Jesus Christ appears <hi>to</hi> us, or <hi>in</hi> us as we are in <hi>Flesh;</hi> then is <hi>that
Grace</hi> put upon our Persons in Christ made Manifest. The <hi>Discovery</hi> is <hi>now</hi>
of that, which <hi>in Truth</hi> was before. The <hi>Mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>estation</hi> is here <hi>below,</hi> but the
<hi>Substance</hi> abides still <hi>above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Manifestation</hi> in thy Flesh is as the <hi>Appearance</hi> of Christ upon thy
Flesh, subject to <hi>Change.</hi> But as is the Person of Christ in the Glory of God,
so is thy Person of Christ comprehended in Christ, <hi>Unchangeable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now pass from the <hi>Second Question</hi> to the <hi>Third.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have seen in some measure, what it is to be Comprehended in Christ. Let
us now proceed to enquire; how we shall know our selves to be Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in Him. There is indeed <hi>Unspeakable,</hi> and <hi>Unchangeable</hi> matter of Joy for
those that are so <hi>Comprehended;</hi> but how shall any Particular Soul be assured
of this concerning herself?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Question:</hi> How shall I know <hi>my self</hi> to be comprehended in Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Art thou comprehended in the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of God? Then
thou art comprehended in <hi>Christ.</hi> For he is the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God in its <hi>Latitude,</hi>
and the <hi>Image</hi> of God <hi>in Large.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hast thou any place in the <hi>Fulness</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or any part in the <hi>Fulness</hi> of the
<hi>Creature?</hi> Then hast thou a <hi>Mansion,</hi> and <hi>Habitation</hi> in the Lord Jesus. <hi>For it
hath pleased the Father, that all Fulness,</hi> (both of God, and the Creature,)
<hi>should dwell in Him, Coloss.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you may <hi>object,</hi> and say; It is true, all things, that have a <hi>Being,</hi>
or <hi>Subsistency,</hi> have it in <hi>Christ:</hi> For <hi>all things subsist <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Him, Coloss.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
            <p>But there are <hi>Two ways</hi> of being <hi>in Christ: One,</hi> as He is <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>First
Creation.</hi> So Plants, and Brute Creatures have their Being, Motion, and Life
in Him, as well as Men, or Angels. What Happiness, or Joy can I have in
this?</p>
            <p>Another Way <hi>of being</hi> in Christ <hi>is, as He is</hi> Head <hi>of the</hi> Second Creation; <hi>the</hi>
First-born from the Dead.</p>
            <p>The Lord Jesus in this State comprehends the Spirits of men in Himself
with a very great Contrariety; some in <hi>Love;</hi> others in <hi>Wrath.</hi> So we read
that there were <hi>Sheep</hi> set on his <hi>Right Hand;</hi> and <hi>Goats</hi> on His <hi>Left, Mat.</hi> 25.
33.</p>
            <p>What comfort can I have in the Lord Jesus, till I know on which <hi>Hand</hi> I
stand? What shall discover to me, whether I be comprehended in his <hi>Love,</hi> or
his <hi>Wrath?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I entreat thee to understand, and lay up this, which I shall now say,
carefully in thine Heart. It is a <hi>Preparation</hi> to the Answer to this <hi>Objection</hi>
which thou hast made, and the only way of <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:49838:90"/>
It is this: The <hi>Left Hand</hi> of Jesus Christ is his <hi>Weakness;</hi> his State, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
under a vail of <hi>Flesh,</hi> as he bears the Image of the <hi>Creature</hi> upon
Himself.</p>
            <p>For this Reason, the Works of <hi>Wrath</hi> are the <hi>Strange</hi> Works of Christ, and
God, <hi>Es.</hi> 28. 21. This Expression, <hi>His Strange Work,</hi> signifies; a work with
which he is not acquainted <hi>in His own Person,</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> a Work, which is
<hi>uncouth</hi> to Him, in which the <hi>Height</hi> of his Skill, and Power delight not to
put forth themselves; a work in which he is <hi>descended</hi> out of his own Form
into some inferiour Form of the Creature, and so become a <hi>Stranger</hi> to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Right Hand</hi> of Christ is the Person, or Spirit of Christ in its full Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
and Glory: as Christ is at the Right Hand of God, that is, in Immediate,
and Personal union with the Father.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Love</hi> of Christ is signified by his <hi>Right Hand,</hi> the meaning is
that <hi>Love</hi> belongs to Christ in the <hi>Propr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

saith: <hi>God is Love, 1 John</hi> 4. 16.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Objection</hi> follows clearly from these <hi>Premises,</hi> if they
be clearly understood.</p>
            <p>You shall know, that you are <hi>comprehended</hi> in the <hi>Love</hi> of the Lord Jesus,
if you look within the <hi>Vail,</hi> beyond the <hi>Creature;</hi> to the <hi>End,</hi> to Jesus Christ
in the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of his own Person, as he is the <hi>Beginning,</hi> and the <hi>End</hi> of all
the Works of God, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 3. 13.</p>
            <p>It is only the Discovery of the naked Person of Christ in you, which can
discover your Persons naked in the Love of Christ.</p>

God in his Eternal Love to your Persons, but by the Shining out of God from
the Naked Face, or Person of Jesus Christ within your Hearts.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>John 5. 10. He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Witness in

               </hi> or <hi>in</hi> Christ, besides <hi>himself;</hi> while you
look upon Christ in any Relation, Capacity, or Consideration; and not in the
<hi>Singleness</hi> of his own heavenly and Divine Person: you will sit under a Cloud,
though light may be sown for you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that followeth me, shall not walk in Darkness, but shall have the Light of
Life, John</hi> 8. 12. You can have Light in your Eye, no longer, than your

               <hi>Glittering Cloud</hi> at best, or a <hi>Shining Vail.</hi> So wait, till Jesus Christ sets
his own Person before your Spirits in the Light of God. When you see him,
you shall in the same Light see your Selves in Him, and together with Him,
<hi>in Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for ever after make your self, your Graces, but <hi>Glasses</hi> to see the Face of
Christ in; and Christ will be a <hi>Glass</hi> in which you shall see your own Face in
the Love, and Glory of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Still you may urge, and say: But <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>when</hi> shall I have this
Appearance of Jesus Christ to me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells thee <hi>how</hi> Jesus Christ shall appear to thee: 2 <hi>Corin,
4. 6. God, who hath made Light to shine out of Darkness, hath shined into our
Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Light shined out of Darkness, so shall Jesus Christ appear in thine heart
out of the midst of Ignorance, Unbelief, Lusts, and all manner of <hi>Contrariety.</hi>
Thy Evil shall no more hinder his Discoveries, than Darkness can the shining
of the Light. His breakings forth no more depend upon, or are assisted by
thy Spirit, than the spreading of the Light through the Air depends upon the
<hi>Air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As Light was brought forth upon the Waters, when there was no Light,
by the Moving or Hatching of the Spirit of God, and by the Word of God:
So shall God upon thy Spirit, as easily, as soon, as a Word is spoken; bring
forth in thy Spirit the Sight of Christ, where there was no S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght at all of him.</p>
            <p>Thus you see <hi>How</hi> the Lord Jesus shall be discovered in thee. But still thou
cryest, <hi>How long Lord? When</hi> shall this be?</p>
            <p>I <hi>answer</hi> thee to that also; that it shall be in the <hi>Fulness</hi> of <hi>thy Time.</hi> As the
World hath its fulness of Time, so hath a particular Soul for the bringing
forth of Christ in it.</p>
            <p>God hath several works upon thy Soul, various Forms to bring thee tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and to bring forth himself in before thee. When these are full, then
will he last of all come forth to thee in his Last and full Appearance, which
is the Manifestation of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>God hath his <hi>Ordinance</hi> with the Sun and Moon, which run their Race
from one end of the Sky unto the other. These at length enlighten every part
of the Earth in its Season, as they come to it in their Course.</p>
            <p>The Ordinance and Covenant of God is, as sure with Jesus Christ, who is
the Day-star and Day-light of thy Spirit. He hath his <hi>Goings forth</hi> decree'd
and set Him from Eternity. Wait thou for him, as the Watch-men watch
for the Morning. For thou shalt so certainly see his Appearance in thy Soul.</p>
            <p>The Vision of Christ is for an appointed Time. It is like the Birth of
<hi>Isaac,</hi> who was the Type. It hath its <hi>Set time.</hi> In its Set time it shall
not fail.</p>
            <p>Go thy ways then, be at Rest, have this assurance in thy self, that thou

one another, or the Spirit of Man answering it self. <hi>Return O Shulamite, that
we may see thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the Company
of two Armies;</hi> Invisible Things, and Visible; Divine, and Humane; God and
the Creature united in a Holy Soul.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have persuaded you to see nothing besides the <hi>Single Person</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> if you would have true <hi>Joy.</hi> Now you may say to me, <hi>what
shall we see</hi> in the Single Person of God and Christ to give us true Joy?</p>
            <p>I think it therefore necessary for me to point out to you the <hi>Several Spring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of Joy for all <hi>Seasons</hi> in the Person of God, and Christ, before I leave this
<hi>Subject,</hi> that so my discourse upon it may be more full, and Satisfactory to the
Soul.</p>
            <p>There are various <hi>Springs</hi> in the Person of God, which but look't upon by

               <hi>Solomon</hi> faith: <hi>A living Dog is better than a dead Lyon. Life</hi> is the best of
all Created Things. Yet the <hi>Love</hi> of God is better than Life.</p>
            <p>Instead of <hi>Better,</hi> you may read <hi>Sweeter.</hi> Did you ever tast a Sweetness in
<hi>Life?</hi> In your own Life? Or in the Life of any Thing, that was dearest to
you? The <hi>Love</hi> of God can make this Sweetness none at all, overcoming it
with a greater Sweetness in itself.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Love</hi> of God can Sweeten the Loss of your own Life, or the Life of
those in whom you have most Delight; because it is itself far Sweeter.</p>

            </p>
            <p>O hear this, you, who with <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> have a full number of <hi>Sins</hi> in
you, and those ripened into so many <hi>Devils:</hi> Though your Iniquities be, as a

               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:49838:92"/>
2. There is a <hi>Healing</hi> Sweetness in the <hi>Love</hi> of God. <hi>David</hi> adds this in the
former place, <hi>Psal. 103. 3. Who healeth all thy Diseases.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Woman,</hi> who had many years been afflicted with a Bloody Issue, and
had spent all on Physitians, was cured by one Touch of the Hem of Christs
Garment. Here is Comfort for you, who have old Sins, or Sorrows, like <hi>Sores</hi>
running continually upon you, and can find no help or ease. The <hi>Love</hi> of
Christ can cure you in a Moment with <hi>one Touch</hi> onely of its Sweetness upon
your Spirits.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The</hi> Love <hi>of Christ hath a</hi> Clearing <hi>Sweetness,</hi> 1 Iohn 5. 20. The
Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, by which we may know
Him, who is true.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Job</hi> said of himself, is true of the <hi>Love</hi> of Christ: It is <hi>Eyes to the

            <p>The <hi>Psalmist</hi> makes a Sweet Conjunction of <hi>Tasting,</hi> and <hi>Seeing, Isal. 34. 8.
O tast and see, that the Lord is gracious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Sam. 14. 2. Jonathan</hi> said, <hi>See, I pray how mine Eyes have been Enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

the <hi>Love</hi> of Christ, and see how the Eyes of your minds will be Enlightned, to
a Discovery of Spiritual and Heavenly Things.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Love</hi> of God hath a <hi>Chearing</hi> Sweetness, the Heavenly Spouse saith to
her Saviour, <hi>Thy Love is better than Wine,</hi> Cant. 1. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the Advice of</hi> Solomon's <hi>Mother,</hi> Prov. 31 6, 7. Give strong drink to him
that is ready to perish; and wine to those that be of a heavy heart. Let him drink,
and forget his Poverty, and remember his Misery no more.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sweetness</hi> of our Saviour's Love, is the <hi>True Wine,</hi> the <hi>New Wine,</hi> as He
is the <hi>True Vine.</hi> This is strong drink, of a strength to ravish and transport the
Soul <hi>out</hi> of, and <hi>above</hi> her self.</p>
            <p>Give this drink to that Spirit which is dropping into Hell or Despair. Give
this spiritual wine to him that hath a heart heavy with guilt, wrath and terrours.
Let him drink freely. One draught of this <hi>Sweetness</hi> shall make him forget his
guilt, and remember his fears no more.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> Sweetness in the <hi>Love</hi> of Christ, is a <hi>Crowning</hi> Sweetness, <hi>Psa. 103.

            <p>The <hi>Love</hi> of God casts its Sweetness all round about thee, that thou canst
turn thy self no way, but thou meetest with this <hi>Sweetness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Jesus Christ encompasseth thee with a <hi>Ring</hi> of Sweetness, as a Garland of
Roses encompasseth the Head. Nothing can come at thy Person, but it must

            <p>St. Iohn <hi>calls Jesus Christ,</hi> Revel. 1. 5, 6. Him that loved us, &amp;c. and

itself no end.</p>
            <p>Fear not lest thy corruptions or evil should outwear thy Saviour's Love.
No; It is made of a durable and everlasting <hi>Sweetness,</hi> which will outlast all
things besides it self, or subdue them to itself.</p>
            <p>Here you may change the Riddle, and sing; Out of sweetness comes strength,
and out of the heavenly meat of our Spirits comes forth the Eater, that devours
all other things, and makes them its meat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 19. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of the <hi>Love</hi> of Christ, that <hi>it passeth knowledge.</hi> This
is a <hi>Conquering</hi> Sweetness, which conquers all our faculties, our largest, even our
Understanding itself.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Understanding</hi> is the <hi>Gate</hi> of the Soul; according to the <hi>capacity</hi> of this,
so is the capacity of the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> of the whole Soul of Man.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Love</hi> of Christ is too strong, too great for them all.</p>
            <p>All the Powers of Man are here overcome: They cannot take it in. Let'
them then cast themselves into this depth of Sweetness, and say, <hi>Because we
cannot take thee into us, do thou take us into thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Spring; Beauty.</hi> This is the <hi>second</hi> ground of <hi>Joy</hi> in the <hi>Person</hi> of God,
H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Beauty.</p>
            <p>David <hi>speaks of this,</hi> Psa. 27. 4. One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will
I, seek after, that I may dwell in the House of the Lord all the daies of my life, to
behold the Beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Three things</hi> are remarkable in these words concerning the <hi>Beauty</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>King,</hi> a King in the <hi>East,</hi> where the Pomp and Glory of
Courts excelled that of these <hi>Western</hi> parts of the world, as much as Courts here
ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne the Countrey. Yet <hi>David</hi> could have for ever left his Court for the
Temple, and the Glories of that, for a sight of those Beauties which are in the
face of God.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>Husband,</hi> and a <hi>Father;</hi> he was sweet enough in both Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
an <hi>Affectionate</hi> Husband, a <hi>Tender</hi> Father: Yet <hi>David</hi> could have been
content never to have seen Wife or Children more, so he might have seen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
the Beauty of God.</p>
            <p>3. The Soul of man hath a <hi>Seminal Infiniteness,</hi> by which her desires grow
endlesly. She therefore is delighted most with those things, which least <hi>bound</hi>
her, which still draw forth fresh desires by opening fresh delights.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:49838:93"/>
The Spirit of Man loves that best, which makes the utmost Satisfaction an
Engagement, upon a farther pursuit.</p>
            <p>Such is the <hi>Beauty</hi> of God. <hi>David</hi> prays, that he may be in the Temple
to <hi>behold</hi> it, and to be <hi>searching still.</hi> The <hi>Loveliness</hi> of the God-Head actuates
that <hi>Seminal Infinitene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> in the Soul, giving her the sweetest rest by suffering
her never to rest from <hi>fresh Enquiries</hi> in her <hi>fullest Discoveries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>Two things</hi> in the <hi>Beauty</hi> of God, which will make thee glad at
all times, if thou turn thine Eye towards them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Beauty</hi> of God <hi>drowns</hi> all other Beauties, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 39. Our <hi>Saviour</hi>
tells us: <hi>No man having drunk old Wine straightway desireth new, for he saith
the old is better.</hi> If thou once drink the old Wine of Eternal Beauties in the
face of Jesus Christ, thou canst not miss or desire the new Wine of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Loveliness, while the relish of that Beauty is upon thy Spirit: For thou
wilt say; The Loveliness of my Saviour is far lovelier, and all other Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is not lovely, compared with this, which so much excels it.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Beauty</hi> of God <hi>draws</hi> all other Beauties into itself.</p>
            <p>Elibu <hi>saith,</hi> Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 34. 14, 15. If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto
himself his Spirit, and his Breath: All Flesh shall perish together, and man shall
turn again to dust.</p>
            <p>All Creatures are moulded out of Darkness as out of Dust. The Beauty of
each Creature is a <hi>Spirit</hi> or <hi>Blast</hi> from God shining upon this darkness, which
makes thee different Flesh of all kinds.</p>
            <p>As the Sun-beams put out the fire, by <hi>drawing</hi> up the finer fiery parts into
themselves; So God sets his face on man, draws in the Spirit of Loveliness to
that face of Loveliness in himself. Then the fleshly form fades, and the Dust
remains alone.</p>
            <p>Keep thine Eye upon this Loveliness in the Person of thy Saviour. So thou
shalt never mourn for the loss of any lovely thing, which was, as the Light of
thine Eyes to thee: For thou shalt meet with every lovely thing, with every
relish of Beauty in this Beauty, as a man meets with the taste of the <hi>Sugar</hi> in
the <hi>Wine</hi> into which it was melted, and dissolv'd.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Spring: Power.</hi> No man can ever want Matter of Rejoycing in any
Case, that understands and considers the <hi>Power</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Saviour</hi> said to the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>dduces,</hi> that denied the Resurrection: <hi>Ye err not
knowing the Scriptures and the Power of God.</hi> If you err and exceed in Grief
at any time, it is, because ye know not the <hi>Power</hi> of God: For if ye did
ye would see there the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> of all your Desires, Hopes,
and Joys.</p>
            <p>When our Saviour was entring into the blackest Cloud of sufferings, that
ever came upon any Creature; He comforted himself in the <hi>Power</hi> of God.
<hi>Mark 14. 36. Abba Father, all things are possible to thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this he comforts his <hi>Disciples</hi> in that great matter of their Salvation:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49838:93"/>
               <hi>Matth. 19. 26. With men this is Impossible, but with God all things are
Possible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Power</hi> of God can do <hi>Three Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>It</hi> can change One contrary into Another, and make them to Embrace
each other.</item>
               <item>2. It can call back time that is past.</item>
               <item>3. It can give a Being to Things, that have been, and have ceased to be any
more.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>The Power of God can change One contrary into Another, and make them
both to Embrace each other.</hi> Psal. 139. 11, 12. <hi>If I say, the Darkness shall
cover me, even the Night shall be light about me.</hi> When thy Soul saith, the
Darkness of this Affliction will over-whelm me, and quite swallow me up:
then can the <hi>Power</hi> of God make that <hi>Night</hi> of Affliction to be a <hi>Light</hi> of
Comfort, and Joy round about thee.</p>
            <p>Yea, the <hi>Darkness hideth not from thee,</hi> saith <hi>David</hi> to God, <hi>but the Night
shineth as the Day.</hi> No Darkness, no Mid-night of Sorrow can hide, or lock up
itself, or a Soul from the Power and Glory of God. These will dwell together
with the deepest darkness, and the blackest night. These can make themselves
One with them, and so make them to <hi>shine</hi> equal with the cheerfullest day of
Prosperity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Power</hi> of God can pierce into the thickest Cloud of Grief. It can bring
in thither all the Love, Excellency, Delight of the God-Head. It can make the
Darkness of Grief a bright Light to discover all these, and lay them open to
the view of your Spirits.</p>
            <p>David <hi>goeth on:</hi> The Darkness and the Light are both alike to thee. <hi>O Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Union of</hi> Contraries! <hi>O Unsearchable</hi> Power! <hi>O</hi> Powerful Matter <hi>of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Joy!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is the onely Truth, and the Measure of Truth, <hi>Darkness,</hi> and <hi>Light</hi>
are both <hi>alike</hi> to him, who is the <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As <hi>Light</hi> holds forth Darkness, and makes Manifest all Excellencies in itself:
So Darkness holds forth Light, and is a manifestation of all Glories, an Image
of all Images of Beauty and Pleasure before God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Light</hi> hath its own proper Appearance, and is seen by God in its own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Shape, as it is in itself. Yet in the seeing of it all Things are seen. So doth
<hi>Darkness</hi> appear before God in its darkest and rightest Form; and all Lights
of Comforts, Holiness, Truth appear together with it in the same Appearance.</p>
            <p>Blessed are they that abide in God, or are like to God: For no <hi>Darkness</hi>
hideth any <hi>Joy</hi> from them, not the Darkness of <hi>Death</hi> itself. The <hi>Grave</hi> shines
to them, as Heaven, and shews the same Spirit, Life, and Glory to their eyes.</p>
            <p>This is the work of the <hi>Power</hi> of God, which makes Light from above,
and darkness from below to meet, and kiss; and like the Man, and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to bear One Image, to become One Light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:49838:94"/>
               <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> Mark 14. 35. prayed to his <hi>Father, That if it were possible that
hour might pass from him.</hi> At the 36th <hi>verse</hi> he tells his Father, that <hi>All things
were possible to him.</hi> Then it was <hi>possible</hi> to the Father, that That hour
should pass away from him. And so his <hi>Prayer</hi> was absolutely for it.</p>
            <p>Other <hi>Scriptures</hi> tell us, that God alwaies heard his Son, and denyed him no
thing; and that he was <hi>heard in that which he feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then it follows, that That Dreadful <hi>Hour did pass</hi> away from Jesus Christ,
though it <hi>did not pass</hi> away. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s was the Comfort of Christ, that <hi>Power</hi> of
God, which could <hi>reconcile</hi> two, which were <hi>contradictions;</hi> that <hi>the sad Hour
should pass away, in not passing away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly, The Power of God can call back Time that is past, and make it to
be present again.</hi> Heb. 13. 8. You read of <hi>Jesus, the same yesterday, to day and
for ever.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is the Fulness, the Image, and the shining out of the
God-Head.</p>
            <p>They are the <hi>Puttings forth,</hi> and Discoveries of Jesus Christ, which make all
<hi>Times, Ages</hi> and <hi>States.</hi> Jesus Christ hath <hi>to day</hi> the same Powers and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
in himself, which being sent forth made <hi>yesterday.</hi> They are only
<hi>drawn in.</hi> If then he please <hi>to day,</hi> to put forth the <hi>same Appearances</hi> to thee,
or pull thee into them; he can make <hi>yesterday</hi> present <hi>to day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he shall open himself fully to thee from the Beginning to the End;
then he will make the Sun to stand still over thy head; he will make all Times
past to <hi>stand forth,</hi> as at the first, and to <hi>stand still</hi> before thee eternally. For
he is <hi>the same yesterday, to day, and for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 12. We read, that at the Resurrection, the <hi>Books</hi> were opened.
<hi>Time</hi> is as a <hi>Book,</hi> which Life opens, and Death shuts. Daies and years passing,
are as the turning over of the <hi>Leaves</hi> of this Book. <hi>Whatever God doth, he
doth it for ever,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastes.</hi> Whatever is written in this
Book, is never to be blotted out, but remains there to be read to eternity. If
any Leaf, or Line were pleasant to thee, and thou mournest, because it is turn'd
over, and past; God can at his pleasure turn that leaf or line back to thee again.</p>
            <p>3. The Power of God can make things which have been, and which have ceased
to be, to be again. <hi>It is a sweet, spiritual, and deep discourse that, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the</hi> Lord <hi>and</hi> Martha, <hi>concerning</hi> Lazarus; Ioh. 11. 23. <hi>Jesus saith unto

he shall rise again in the Resurrection at the last day. V. 25. Iesus <hi>said unto her,</hi>
I am the Resurrection, and the Life.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ is the <hi>Power,</hi> the <hi>Treasury</hi> of God, <hi>from</hi> which all things are
brought forth, <hi>in</hi> which they are laid up again, and ever to be found.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Person</hi> of Christ is the <hi>Life,</hi> and the <hi>Resurrection;</hi> while things are, they
are <hi>in him,</hi> as in their <hi>Root.</hi> When they are no more <hi>in themselves,</hi> they are still
<hi>in him,</hi> as in a <hi>Repository.</hi> They return <hi>into him,</hi> as the beauty of dying Flowers
into their <hi>Root,</hi> to come forth again at <hi>Spring,</hi> in a better manner.</p>

The <hi>Person</hi> of the Lord Jesus is the <hi>Life.</hi> This world is but as the shadowy

in him.</p>
            <p>The Lord Jesus is the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> For when he discovers himself to us, then
we see all things again in a full, high, immortal manner.</p>
            <p>Hast thou lost any comfort by Death, or any other change in this world;

            <p>4. <hi>Spring; Wisdom.</hi> The <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God rightly understood is a Fountain
of Peace and Pleasures, which will flow perpetually into the heart of man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Two Scriptures</hi> testifie of this <hi>Wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Scripture, <hi>Eph. 1. 11. This</hi> Scripture speaketh of <hi>God,</hi> who worketh all
things after the counsel of his own will.</p>
            <p>These <hi>words</hi> hold forth <hi>four things:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. A Workman. 2. The Latitude of his Workings. 3. The Pattern. 4. The
Original of that Pattern.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Workman.</hi> This is God, who worketh. The chief Agent, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-wheel</hi>
in all Motions is the God-Head. Learned Men say, that if the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
should stand still, all Things here below would be immediately at a stand,
as in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Darkness. It is most true of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which moves, and
makes, and works all things by the <hi>Movings</hi> of that Life, which it hath in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Trinity</hi> should stop in the course of its mutual Communion, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments:
This stop would be a <hi>Spoke</hi> set in the <hi>Wheel</hi> of the Creation; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could stir any more.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Latitude</hi> of his Workings, God worketh <hi>all Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God worketh all Things <hi>Collectively</hi> in the General and whole Sum.</p>
            <p>God worketh all things <hi>Distributively,</hi> in Particulars. <hi>The Earth is the Lords</hi>
Work, <hi>and the Fulness thereof, Psal.</hi> 24. 1. There is no time, nor any minute,
or moment of Time, which is not fashioned, and carried on by God. <hi>My times
are in thine Hand:</hi> Saith the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 31. 15. There is no Affair nor the
the least Circumstance of any Affair, be it good, or evil, which is not the Work,
and the gift of God. <hi>Shall we receive Good, and not Evil from the Hand of
God;</hi> saith <hi>Job, Job</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>God <hi>rides upon the Circuit of the Heavens, Psal.</hi> 68. 4. So he is the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Cause</hi> of Things.</p>
            <p>God also <hi>fills All in All, Ephes.</hi> 1. 23. So He descends into the <hi>Lowest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
the narrowest Compass, and becomes every where the most <hi>Particular
Cause</hi> of every Thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:49838:95"/>
God saith of the <hi>Tree</hi> in the <hi>Prophet</hi> for the <hi>Clusters</hi> sake: <hi>Spare it, there is
a Blessing in it.</hi> So mayst thou say of any Thing, whatever it be, great or small,
for which thou mournest, or frettest: <hi>Spare thy self: There is a Blessing, for
there is a God in this Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is not only a <hi>Concurrent</hi> cause, working his Part, and leaving to other
Causes their Parts apart. But he is a <hi>Comprehensive Cause,</hi> uniting all in himself
and spreading himself thorow all, 1 <hi>Corin. 8. 6. There is One God who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
all in all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherever there is any <hi>Agent</hi> that works: God works all in that <hi>Agent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherever there is any <hi>Form</hi> of working: God works all in that <hi>Form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherever there is any <hi>Subject</hi> to be wrought upon, or to receive the work:
God works all in that <hi>Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherever there is any <hi>Effect</hi> to be wrought: God works all in that <hi>Effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not an Angel, or Bird flies, or falls: not a Thought, a Hair, a Dust moves;
but as he moves in it, and moves it.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Pattern</hi> of these Workings. God worketh all Things <hi>according
to Counsel. Counsel,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> are both the same Thing.</p>
            <p>This is the Glory of God, and the Happiness of the Creature, that nothing
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>omes to pass, which is not the <hi>Work</hi> of God; and nothing is wrought by God,
which is not a Work of <hi>Wisdom. Philosophers,</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> agree in
setting forth the excellent Nature of <hi>Wisdom</hi> by a <hi>Two-fold Description</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Description. Wisdom</hi> is <hi>Knowledge with a Head.</hi> Knowledge is the
Image of Things. The Golden Head of this Image is the Heavenly Image of
God in the Person of our Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 18. 19. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Study of the Nature of Angels, not
<hi>Wisdom,</hi> but <hi>Folly,</hi> and Vanity; a vain Puffing up of the Fleshly Mind, why?
Is not this a High, and Excellent Knowledge? Yes. But now it was vanity,
not Wisdom; a <hi>vain Swelling,</hi> not a <hi>Substantial Fulness,</hi> and Greatness of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in those, of whom the Apostle speaks, <hi>Because they held not the Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God then, who works all things in Counsel, and true Wisdom, holds the
<hi>Head</hi> in all His Workings: that is, whatever he brings forth, He brings
it forth in the Divine Appearance of his Son; he brings forth the Divine
Appearance of his Son upon it, as the <hi>Head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wisdom <hi>saith of God, and herself,</hi> Prov. 1. 27, 29, 30. When he prepared the
Heavens, I was there, when He appointed the Foundations of the Earth: Then I
was by Him, as his Delight.</p>
            <p>This may be as truly spoken of every Passage of thy Life, of the least Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
that concerns thy Person. For the same <hi>God</hi> in the same <hi>Wisdom</hi> hath
wrought these; that prepared the Heavens, and laid the Foundation of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Thou mayst with as great Assurance hear (in every Thing of Grief or Joy,
which thou meetest with in Flesh, or Spirit) the Glorious Person of thy Beloved
Saviour speaking to thee after this manner: <hi>God hath prepared this for thee, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49838:95"/>
I am here. This hath the Father appointed for thee; and now am I with thee, to
be thy Delight, brought up, and growing up before thee, together with this, and
every other Appearance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You look upon things <hi>vainly,</hi> with a <hi>Fleshly</hi> mind, after a <hi>heedless</hi> manner,
if you see not the Brightness, and Delight of the God-Head in the Person of
Christ, as a Crown of Rejoycing upon every Providence. You deface the
work of God, you look not upon it, as he hath wrought it, <hi>Holding the Head</hi>
if you see not the Face of Christ in every Act, or Accident, as in a <hi>Glass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God in this Sense hath made Christ his <hi>Only Begotten</hi> Son; in that he brings
forth nothing but <hi>Discoveries</hi> of Jesus Christ. For he is the <hi>Head</hi> of all Things;
and this is the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, the <hi>Holding of this Head</hi> in all.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Description</hi> of <hi>Wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Description: Wisdom</hi> is the <hi>Fulness</hi> of Things, Jesus Christ is the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God,</hi> and the <hi>Fulness</hi> of <hi>all Things, Colos.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wisdom</hi> is that Contrivance, that Harmony of Things, that casts the whole
Fulness of Things into each Thing. As Members in the Body, amongst
whom the Joy of all pertains to every one; and the Grief of each One to
all: So are all the Parts of that work, which is wrought in <hi>Wisdom. Wisdom</hi>
is a Spirit, that conveys the Life, Power, and Sense of all into each Particular;
that all may rejoyce, and mourn together every where.</p>
            <p>As in a good <hi>Picture,</hi> all the <hi>Proportions</hi> of the whole Face meet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center
as it were, in each Line, Point, or Touch; giving you from thence a
Cast of the Beauty of the whole: So hath God prepared, and appointed all
his Works <hi>in Wisdom,</hi> like an Excellent Picture; that the <hi>Fulness</hi> of the <hi>Whole,</hi>
and the Beauty of <hi>all Parts</hi> may shew forth themselves from <hi>every Part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is there any thing so dark, so low, as that the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God reacheth not
to it, and shines not in it? If the Wisdom of God be there, then is there the
<hi>Center,</hi> the <hi>Concurrency,</hi> the <hi>Union</hi> of all Things, of all Glory.</p>
            <p>If the Wisdom of God shine there, then is there a <hi>Spiritual Light</hi> opening
all Divine Beauties, making that Thing, the <hi>Gate</hi> of the Creation, of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
Heaven, and the Divine Nature. This is that Traffique of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which
makes the <hi>Merchandise</hi> of it, better than that of <hi>Silver, Gold,</hi> or <hi>Pearl.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>The Original of that Pattern.</hi> God works all things according to the
<hi>Counsel of his will.</hi> The <hi>Will</hi> of God is the <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Original</hi> of his <hi>Wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Will</hi> of God is the highest <hi>Rule, Rest,</hi> and <hi>Rejoycing</hi> of all manner of
Goodness.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phaenix</hi> is said to spring out of a Nest of all manner of Spices laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and fired by the Sun, the Will of God is such a <hi>Flaming Nest</hi> of all
Beauties, and Sweetnesses at their Height. Out of this <hi>will</hi> the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God
springs forth into every Act of Providence, being Beautiful, and Precious in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Will <hi>of God is the highest</hi> Reason <hi>of all things.</hi> What if God willing
to shew the Riches of his Grace? What if God willing to shew the Power of his
Wrath?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:49838:96"/>
The <hi>Will</hi> in a Spirit is as the <hi>Sea</hi> to a River. All its workings flow <hi>out</hi> of
it, and <hi>into</hi> it. It is its <hi>Spring,</hi> and <hi>Fulness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shall not <hi>thy Will</hi> rest, and rejoyce in that, which is the <hi>Will of God;</hi> that
is the <hi>Highest Reason;</hi> the fullest Rest, and Blessedness of the Divine Nature?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Will</hi> of God, out of which God himself drinks all his Delights, in which
he bathes himself: this <hi>Will</hi> is the Eternal <hi>Fountain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God is a Large, and Broad <hi>River</hi> poured forth from this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
Every <hi>Creature,</hi> each <hi>Passage</hi> of things in the Creature, is the <hi>Water</hi> of this
River. Shall it not be <hi>Sweet</hi> to thee? Canst thou not drink of this Water of
the River of God, sent forth from his own Fountain with Delight?</p>
            <p>2. Scripture; Deut. 32. 4. Moses <hi>sings of God:</hi> He is the Rock: His work
is perfect: All his ways are Iudgment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Work</hi> of God is <hi>Perfect</hi> in the <hi>whole.</hi> For all the ways of God in his
work in <hi>Particular,</hi> are in Judgment, that is, in <hi>exact Wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This place affords us <hi>Three</hi> comfortable <hi>Observations</hi> concerning the ways,
and works of God.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Observation: Nothing comes to pass, but that which is best.</item>
               <item>2. Observation: Nothing falls out but in the best Time.</item>
               <item>3. Nothing is brought about, but in the best manner.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The former place of <hi>Scripture</hi> taught us, that <hi>all</hi> things are the <hi>Work</hi> of
God. This teacheth us, that <hi>his work</hi> is <hi>Perfect,</hi> and all the ways of it <hi>Exact,</hi>
according to the best <hi>Judgment</hi> of things, and the rightest rules of Wisdom,
which are the <hi>Weights</hi> in the <hi>Ballance</hi> of our Judgment.</p>
            <p>1. Observation: Nothing comes to pass, but that, which is best. David saith:
It was good for me, that I was afflicted: Psal. 119. 71.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Goodness</hi> is made up of all <hi>Perfections. Evil,</hi> by any one <hi>Defect.</hi> Affliction
had not been <hi>good</hi> for <hi>David,</hi> if it had not been <hi>Best.</hi> If it had kept out any thing,
that might have been <hi>better</hi> for him, it had been an <hi>Evil</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom. 8. All things work together for the good of those that love God.</hi> Where
all things <hi>work together</hi> for good, there all things are like <hi>Stones</hi> in an <hi>Arch,</hi> in
which every Stone is absolutely necessary. If you pull any one out of its place,
the whole Arch falls. Where many things fall into <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> or <hi>Harmony</hi> for
good, there the <hi>Stops,</hi> and <hi>Shakes</hi> make the Musick, as well, as the <hi>Stroaks,</hi> and
<hi>Sounds;</hi> there every thing is <hi>Best.</hi> For the Alteration of any thing alters the
<hi>Harmony.</hi> If all things <hi>work together</hi> for good, than each <hi>Particular</hi> thing with
all the <hi>Circumstances,</hi> and <hi>Defects</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Observation: Nothing falls out, but in the best time. Eccles.</hi> 3. 11. We
learn, that God hath made every thing <hi>Beautiful in its Season.</hi> Every thing is
brought forth by God in the <hi>Season</hi> of its beauty, so that you may say; <hi>This
Time, and this Thing were fitted one for another from Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Jews say; that Souls were match't, and pair'd in Heaven: and that
Marriages prove happy on Earth, when they were first made in Heaven; when
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49838:96"/>
a Soul meets with its first Mate. God hath from Eternity match't every <hi>Thing</hi>
to its <hi>Time.</hi> And every <hi>Thing</hi> meets fully with the same <hi>Time</hi> on Earth. So it
proves a Lovely, and Glorious Marriage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 3. A good man is compared to a <hi>Tree,</hi> that brings forth his <hi>Fruit
in its Season.</hi> The good God doth so, much more. He brings forth all the Fruits
of his Providence, whether they be Bitter, or Sweet, in their proper Season;
in that Season, in which they have a true, and full Beauty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> never befal us, but in their own <hi>Season,</hi> when they are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
kindly, and Beautiful. If a good should happen to thee in the Time of
an Evil, or an Evil in the Time of a Good, it were like the Stars seen at Noon
and the Sun at midnight; which would be a matter of Terrour, and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to Mankind; arguing Disorder in Nature, and presaging Confusions to
the world.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Observation: Nothing is brought about, but in the best manner.</hi> The
Jews witnessed of Christ, that he had done all things <hi>well;</hi> not only <hi>good</hi> for the
<hi>Matter,</hi> but also <hi>well</hi> for the <hi>Manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are Three Things, which commend a <hi>Diamond. 1. The</hi> Goodness
of the Stone. 2. <hi>The</hi> well-setting. 3. <hi>The</hi> well-cutting of it. Every <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
of God towards thee is such a <hi>Diamond.</hi> It is <hi>Best</hi> in itself. It is <hi>well-set,</hi>
in the best <hi>Season,</hi> and State of Things. It is <hi>well-cut,</hi> all the <hi>Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
are ordered, and polish't with the best skill, like Points of the Diamond, to
sparkle forth most Sweetness, and Beauty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All His ways are Judgment.</hi> Every way of God, in each Circumstance of
every work is scan'd, and judg'd, and so disposed in the most <hi>Judicious</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Not a Mote, or a Hair in any business falls <hi>casually,</hi> or lies neglected, but
is weighed in Judgment, and ordered with the highest skill, and care. Never
then repine more or say; if it had not been <hi>This,</hi> or <hi>Then,</hi> or <hi>Thus,</hi> I could
have born it. For now thou sinnest against the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, which hath
ordered, and appointed all these Three; <hi>This, Then,</hi> and <hi>Thus:</hi> So that <hi>This</hi>
was <hi>Best; Then</hi> it was most <hi>Beautiful;</hi> and <hi>Thus</hi> it was the greatest <hi>Blessing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will conclude this <hi>Particular,</hi> with that of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> Prov.
3. 17. <hi>All the ways of wisdom are Peace, and all her Paths are Pleasantness</hi>
This is true <hi>Two ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> all the goings forth of Wisdom in thy Spirit are Peaceful, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant.
If Wisdom enlighten thy way, and lead thee forth into all things by the
Beams of her Discoveries, as the Path of thy Spirit: then all the Out-goings
of thy soul into Things, and all the Appearances of Things to thy Soul, will
be like a Sweet Tune, or Pleasant Dance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> all the goings forth of God in his Wisdom are Paths of Peace, and
Pleasantness. No providences would be a Labyrinth or Wilderness to a man,
to bring him to a loss; if he travelled thorow them with that <hi>Thread</hi> of Light,
with which God went forth into them. Do but go by the <hi>Foot-steps</hi> of God,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49838:97"/>
and track his <hi>Wisdom</hi> in the world; and you shall walk continually in a Smooth
and quiet Path, in a Path of Rest, and Joy even thorow the Darkest Thickets.</p>
            <p>I have spoken of the <hi>Fourth Spring</hi> of <hi>Joy</hi> in God, <hi>His Wisdom.</hi> Now let
us pass to the next.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Spring: The Glory of God. Psal.</hi> 8. 1. David breaks forth into Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
O <hi>Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the Earth! Who
hast set thy Glory above the Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divines distinguish the <hi>Glory</hi> of God into <hi>Essential,</hi> and <hi>Manifestative.</hi> The
<hi>Essential Glory</hi> of God is that which shines Eternally in the Person, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God. This <hi>Beauty</hi> is the <hi>God-Head's</hi> Self in the <hi>Image,</hi> which is <hi>Jesus
Christ.</hi> But I am not now to speak of this. For I spake of this <hi>Glory</hi> before
in the <hi>Second Spring,</hi> the <hi>Beauty</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Manifestative Glory</hi> of God is that, which he holds forth to us in the
<hi>Creature. David</hi> speaks of the <hi>Essential Glory</hi> of God, when he saith, that God
hath set his <hi>Glory above the Heavens.</hi> No creature can bring forth, or bear
the Essential Glory of God. It is above the highest, the most heavenly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in respect to its <hi>Excellency,</hi> or <hi>Capacity. David</hi> speaks of the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festative
Glory</hi> of God in those words: How excellent is <hi>thy Name in all the
Earth!</hi> The <hi>Name</hi> is the <hi>Image</hi> of God, the Appearance or Manifestation of
his Glory. This <hi>Name</hi> of God is in All the Earth, in the lowest part, or state of
the creature, and every thing of it. The <hi>Name</hi> of God is <hi>Excellent,</hi> to <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
in all the Earth. What a Foundation is this to build Joy upon in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
condition? Thou canst not be so low in the Earth, but thou mayest read
the Name of God, and see his Glory in thy lowest state.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Look then upon thy greatest Loss, or Cross, and say,</hi> My God, how excellent
is thy Name in This also? The Death of my friend, mine own grief shall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
in mine eyes, because they are the manifestations of thy Glory. I will call no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
dark, bitter, or base, in which thou writest thy Name, and hast thy Beauty
shining forth with an excellency.</p>
            <p>I have now finished my Answer to the second <hi>Mistake,</hi> which contains <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi>
how to look upon the single Person of God, and Christ; what to look
upon in That Person, which will fill us with Joy in every condition. Now I am
arrived at the <hi>Third Mistake,</hi> which hinders the Soul from attaining to a state
of Spiritual Joy.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Mistake:</hi> That <hi>Spiritual Grief</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> are inconsistent, and cannot stand
together. You shall perceive this, as a <hi>Principle</hi> laid down in the hearts of
many Christians by the <hi>Reply</hi> which they will make, when they are pressed to
<hi>Joy</hi> as a <hi>Grace,</hi> and to continual <hi>Delight,</hi> as a <hi>Duty.</hi> Woe is me, saith one,
how can I have any Joy, who have so many corruptions, and sins to mourn for
continually? Alas! saith another, should I rejoyce, or take any delight, who
am still called to mourning and heaviness by private Afflictions, or publick
Calamities? I answer all these, that they err, not understanding aright the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49838:97"/>
Scriptures, and the Power of the Spirit of God in the Soul. They erre in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Grief</hi> in the Spirit do <hi>hinder,</hi> and not <hi>help</hi> forward one
another. I will endeavour the <hi>Removal</hi> of this <hi>Mistake</hi> by <hi>Two General Rules,</hi>
and then by <hi>Particular Application</hi> of these Rules.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Two General Rules</hi> are these:
<list>
                  <item>1. Rule: Take heed of separating those things which God hath ioyned.</item>
                  <item>2. Rule: Take not any mourning to be holy, which hath not a holy mirth
mingled with it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Rule: Take heed of separating those things which God hath joyned. Solomon</hi>
saith, <hi>That God hath set One thing over against another.</hi> We may read it; God
hath set One thing <hi>By</hi> another, or <hi>For</hi> another. God often sets several things
<hi>One By another,</hi> to <hi>compleat</hi> each other; and we set them <hi>One Against another,</hi>
to <hi>fight,</hi> and destroy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God is One, Gal.</hi> 3. 20. But the name of the Devil is <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Beholding</hi> all things in One <hi>Light:</hi> by <hi>Possessing</hi> all things in One
<hi>Life;</hi> by <hi>Enjoying</hi> all things in One <hi>Love,</hi> is <hi>One,</hi> and Blessed for ever.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Devil</hi> by <hi>Dividing</hi> becomes a <hi>Destroyer,</hi> the Principle, and Seat of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ is the <hi>Mediator:</hi> He makes things distant to <hi>meet</hi> in him: He
<hi>gathers</hi> up all things into One, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ by <hi>Reconciling</hi> divers <hi>Appearances</hi> of God, divers <hi>Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
in Man, makes his <hi>Church</hi> to be of many Members <hi>One Body;</hi> and of <hi>all
things</hi> makes <hi>One Beauty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We by setting One <hi>Appearance,</hi> or State of the same thing, One <hi>Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or Gift to sight with another, make the <hi>Church</hi> a <hi>Babel,</hi> and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
a Field of Blood.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spirit</hi> is a <hi>Band of Unity,</hi> Eph. 4. 3. <hi>Unity</hi> is in the <hi>Spirit; Division</hi> is in
the <hi>Flesh.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> by binding up various <hi>Operations</hi> of the same Grace,
various <hi>Illuminations</hi> of the same Truth, in One Band of Unity, makes us <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
in <hi>Judging,</hi> and <hi>Living.</hi> We first <hi>breaking</hi> off the <hi>Parcels</hi> of Truth, and
<hi>Properties</hi> of Grace, then <hi>oppose</hi> them. So we become <hi>carnal,</hi> apt to <hi>miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages</hi>
in our selves, and <hi>contentions</hi> with others. Take heed then of separating
those things which God hath joyned. He is a growing Saint, a God-like man
among men, who hath a Spirit Reconciling and Uniting Persons, Things, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Graces, Factions, Affections, Parties, Properties.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Rule: Take not any mourning to be holy or spiritual, which hath not a holy
mirth mingled with it.</p>
            <p>Be angry, and sin not, <hi>saith the</hi> Apostle. Let not the Sun go down upon your
wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 26.</p>
            <p>So saith the spiritual man; <hi>I will mourn, and not sin. The Sun shall not go
down upon my Griefs.</hi> The Sun of a Saint, the Sun of the Soul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:49838:98"/>
who hath the Light of Life. The shining of his Face upon the Soul, makes
it cheerful; fills it with beams of Joy; glads it more than store of Corn and
Wine can glad any carnal heart. Spiritual <hi>Joy</hi> is the <hi>Sun-shine</hi> of Christ's
face in the soul. <hi>The Bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they shall
fast, and mourn in those daies:</hi> saith <hi>Christ</hi> of his Disciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 35.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> of the Soul, as the <hi>Sun</hi> is of the <hi>Earth.</hi> His
Presence and Appearance in the Soul is the Joy of it. Every thing is sinful in
us, which casts down the Light of our Saviour's countenance in our Spirits. 'Tis
Sin to grieve the Spirit of Christ, that is, to straiten it and hinder it from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
and putting forth its Joys in us.</p>
            <p>If the Passion of Grief or Anger gather to a Thick Cloud, so as to Darken
the bright Face of the Lord Jesus in us, it becomes a Corruption, and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.
We are commanded to <hi>Rejoyce evermore,</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 16. <hi>Rejoyce
in the Lord always, Phil.</hi> 4. 4. Our Spirits are to be playing, and sporting
themselves uncessantly in the Light of our Saviours Presence. It is from the
Devil, and the Flesh, whatever interrupts this Joy, these Sportings.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rain-bow</hi> was the Covenant of God in the Cloud, that the <hi>Waters
should no more cover the Earth: Genes.</hi> 9. 6, 15.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rain-bow</hi> is ever set in a Black, Watery Cloud. But it is begotten by
the Reflection of the Sun-beams upon that Cloud, mixing their chearful Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
with its Melancholy Blackness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grief</hi> is then alone a <hi>Grace</hi> in thy soul, when the Sun shines upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
Cloud. When the Glory of Christ mingles its sweet Beams with thy Grief,
and makes a <hi>Spiritual Rain-bow</hi> in thy Soul. Then is there the <hi>Covenant</hi> of
God in the <hi>Cloud</hi> of thy Grief.</p>
            <p>This Over-spreading of a Spiritual chearfulness upon thy Sorrows is a Sign
from Heaven, that the waters of Sin, Despair, and Wrath shall never quite
cover the Image of God in thee.</p>
            <p>I now come to the <hi>Particular Applications</hi> of these <hi>General Rules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will do this under <hi>Two Heads:</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Spiritual Mourning.</item>
                  <item>2. The mixture of Mirth with it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Head: Spiritual Mourning.</hi> I will here set before you the Nature of a
<hi>Holy Grief</hi> in these <hi>Four Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Matter.</item>
               <item>2. The Manner.</item>
               <item>3. The Measure.</item>
               <item>4. The Mystery.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. The <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Mourning</hi> is <hi>Evil</hi> in all the <hi>Kinds</hi> and <hi>Degrees</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>Eccles. 3. 3, 4. Solomon <hi>couples</hi> Two Verses <hi>fitly together:</hi> A Time to Kill
and a Time to Heal: a Time to break down, and a Time to build up. A Time to
Weep, and a Time to Laugh, a Time to Mourn, and a Time to Dance.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Times</hi> answer one another. The <hi>Killing</hi> Time is the <hi>Weeping</hi> Time:
the <hi>Healing</hi> Time is the <hi>Laughing</hi> Time. The Time of <hi>Breaking</hi> is the Time
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49838:98"/>
for <hi>Mourning,</hi> and the time of <hi>Building</hi> is the time for <hi>Dancing.</hi> Man is
Gods <hi>Cymbal,</hi> or <hi>Harp.</hi> Our Affections, and Passions are the <hi>Strings</hi> upon it.
It makes good Musick, when it keeps <hi>Time</hi> with the Administration of God.
When the Lord brings forth <hi>Good</hi> Things for us, then he toucheth our <hi>Sweet</hi>
Affections, and awakens them. When he brings any <hi>Evil</hi> upon us, then he
strikes upon our <hi>sharp,</hi> and sad Passions, to make them sound.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Two Sorts</hi> of <hi>Evil:</hi> The <hi>Evil</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and of <hi>Misery. Moses</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
both these <hi>Evils</hi> by a <hi>Contrariety,</hi> Levit. 26. 23. 24. <hi>If ye will walk
contrary unto me: I also will walk contrary unto you.</hi> The <hi>Evil</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> is the
<hi>Contrariety</hi> of Man to God: The <hi>Evil</hi> of <hi>Misery</hi> is the <hi>Contrariety</hi> of God to
Man. <hi>Sin</hi> is the <hi>Running out</hi> of Things from the Glory of God: the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the <hi>Harmony</hi> of Divine Love, Beauty, and Wisdom by a <hi>Discord. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
is the <hi>Return</hi> of Things into this Glory: the bringing of the <hi>Discord</hi> into
<hi>a Harmony</hi> again. Both these <hi>Evils</hi> are the <hi>Matter</hi> of Spiritual Mourning.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Evil of Sin.</hi> We are to grieve for the <hi>Evil</hi> of Sin <hi>in our selves,</hi> and
<hi>in others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We are to grieve for <hi>Sin in our selves,</hi> Psa. 51. 3. <hi>David</hi> cryes to God, <hi>I
acknowledge my transgression; my sin is before me.</hi> When <hi>Sin</hi> appears in its right
shape to us, it brings forth <hi>sorrow,</hi> as its <hi>Image</hi> in our souls, as naturally, as the
face of God begets a face of Joy in our hearts. Mourning is as the <hi>Mouth</hi> by
which we confess our corruptions. It is the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> in which the
sense of guilt holds forth it self in the Spirit. He that grieves, and glories not
in the Glory of God, calls <hi>Good Evil,</hi> and <hi>Light Darkness.</hi> He that is merry,
and mourns not under guilt, he calls <hi>Evil Good,</hi> and <hi>Darkness Light.</hi> Both lye
under a <hi>Curse;</hi> one for turning the <hi>Glory</hi> of God into a <hi>Lye;</hi> the other for
Boasting himself in a <hi>Lie</hi> against the <hi>Truth.</hi> Not to feel a <hi>Sorrow</hi> for <hi>Sin,</hi> is to
deny the Nature of it, to destroy the Person of Christ, to make void his Cross,
to confound, and dissolve the Mystery of God.</p>
            <p>2. We are to grieve for Sin in others, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 53. David <hi>complains,</hi>
Horrour hath taken hold of me, because of the Wicked, that forsake thy Law.</p>
            <p>When the Sun, the Light of the World, laboureth under an Eclipse by the
Moon, the Sight of it naturally strikes a kind of Horrour upon the Spirits of
Men. For it portends Blood, and Ruine in one Kind or another. In each Sin
there is a more Dreadful <hi>Eclipse.</hi> The <hi>Image</hi> of God, which is the True Life,
and Light of all Creatures, laboureth, and groaneth being opprest under, and
darkned by the Image and will of Man. He that understands this Sight, sees in it
a certain Presage of Wrath, and Desolation, which fills him with Astonishment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephes. 4. 30. Grieve not,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, the Holy Spirit of Christ.</hi> Sin
grieves the Spirit of Christ. As Jesus Christ Sympathizeth, and Suffereth with
us, having a fellow-feeling of our Infirmities by a Union of Spirits. So a good
man hath a Sympathy, and fellow-feeling with his Saviour, when he sees his
Spirit grieved by the Sins of other men. Thus we are to <hi>Mourn</hi> for the <hi>First
Evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the Evil of <hi>Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:49838:99"/>
2. <hi>The Evil of Suffering.</hi> We are to mourn for our <hi>own Sufferings,</hi> and the
<hi>Sufferings of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>We are to mourn for our own Sufferings,</hi> Es. 22. 12. <hi>In that day did the
Lord God of Hosts call to weeping, and to mourning.</hi> What <hi>Day</hi> was this? It
was a Day of <hi>Calamity,</hi> when Death was before their Eyes. So you may see at
the 13th <hi>verse:</hi> They said: <hi>Let us eat, and drink, for to morrow we shall die.</hi>
The Providences, and Appearances of God are his <hi>Language,</hi> in which he
speaks to us. God requires of us, that we should have an <hi>Ear</hi> to hear, and a
<hi>Tongue</hi> to answer him in his own Language. It is said in one place, that the
<hi>Heaven, should hear the Earth.</hi> Is it not much more fit then, that the Earth
should hear the Heavens? The <hi>Heavens</hi> are the Image of God, the Heart of
Man is the <hi>Earth.</hi> Shall God speak to us in Wrath, and Ruine; and shall
not we hear, and answer him with Fear and Trembling? Shall God speak to
us in Thunder, Storms and Blood; And shall not we hear, and answer him
with Tears, and Broken Hearts?</p>
            <p>2. We are to mourn for the Sufferings of Others, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 11. 2, 9. Who,
<hi>saith St.</hi> Paul, is sick, and I am not afflicted? who is offended, and I burn not?</p>
            <p>Every good Man is like his God, and Father. All Things are <hi>his,</hi> because
he is the <hi>Spouse</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Child</hi> and Heir of <hi>God,</hi> one Spirit with Christ,
and God. So he suffers in all. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> said; <hi>I make up the Sufferings of
Christ in my Flesh:</hi> So saith he; <hi>All Things that Suffer, add to my Sorrows, and
make up my Sufferings in their Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A good Man is One spirit with Christ. Thus he is like Christ, a Spirit of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Sweetness, which longs, and labours to bring forth itself in Peace, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
every where. When it meets with a Soul shut up in Griefs, it is straitned
and afflicted there, and burns like a Fire, to be at liberty in that Heart. This
Spirit suffers with each Heart, till it can make every Heart to rejoyce with it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
It is never entirely Risen from the Dead, while there is any one in the
Grave of Sorrows. That One is a Member of its Body; and it is ever present
with the whole Body, being all of itself in every Part of that; all in the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
of the Militant and Suffering Part, as truly as it is all in the Joys of the
Triumphant, and Rejoycing Part. This is the <hi>Matter</hi> of our <hi>Mourning, Evil</hi>
in both kinds, of <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Suffering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The manner of our Mourning.</hi> This is the <hi>Second Particular.</hi> My way
in this shall be to give you some <hi>Distinctions,</hi> and then some <hi>Rules</hi> drawn from
those Distinctions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Distinctions</hi> are <hi>Three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> of the <hi>Appearances of God. Secondly,</hi> of the <hi>State of Things.
Thirdly,</hi> of the <hi>Life of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Distinction, <hi>of the</hi> Appearances of God: These are Two-fold.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Supream.</item>
               <item>2. Subordinate Appearance.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. The <hi>Supream Appearance</hi> of God is <hi>One,</hi> Blessed for ever, perfect in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49838:99"/>
Glory, Unchangeable. This is <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the <hi>same Yesterday, to Day, and for
Ever: Heb.</hi> 13. 8. This is that Heavenly Image of the God-Head, which
gathers up into one, in itself, all Images of things, in all Times. <hi>David</hi> speaks
of this, <hi>Psal. 16. 11. In thy Presence</hi> (or Face) <hi>is fulness of Joy: at thy
Right Hand are pleasures for evermore.</hi> In these words are <hi>Four Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Presence,</hi> or Face, and the <hi>Right Hand</hi> of God. Both these expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
signify God in his Naked, Highest, and Rightest Appearance. 2. <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
are here doubly exprest by <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Pleasures. 3. There</hi> is <hi>Perfection</hi>
in those Pleasures, a <hi>Fulness of Joy.</hi> This fulness intimates a <hi>Solidity,</hi> or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiality
of Joy for the <hi>kind;</hi> and <hi>Abundance,</hi> and Satisfactoriness for <hi>Degree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. A <hi>Perpetuity</hi> is added to all this. The Pleasures are <hi>for evermore.</hi> This is
the Description of God in his <hi>Supream Appearance,</hi> in which there is all <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety;</hi>
but no <hi>Mixture:</hi> all <hi>Communion,</hi> and Communication; but no <hi>Chance.</hi>
This Appearance is Light without any Darkness.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Subordinate Appearance</hi> of God is <hi>Manifold.</hi> God in this respect is
called, <hi>the Lord of Hosts,</hi> because he comes forth in an Army of Appearances,
which are his Ten Thousand Chariots, his Millions of Angels. God in his
Supream Appearance, is <hi>Light:</hi> in his Subordinate Appearance, a <hi>Fire.</hi> He is
in this Appearance a Mixture of Light, and Darkness. He hath various effects,
Cherishing, and Consuming: Drawing forth all Things, and devouring them
again. Here God is various; sometimes blazing forth brightly; sometimes wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
up himself in a thick Smoak: sometimes Burning Dreadfully; sometimes
shining out Sweetly. This is the Appearance of God, as he comes forth in a
Created Image to the Creature of the First Creation. This is called by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
the <hi>Back-parts</hi> of God, in which he hath many Names proclaimed before
him, which have Change, and Contrariety in them: <hi>Exod. 34. 6, 7. Gracious,</hi>
and <hi>Jealous; Long-suffering,</hi> and <hi>visiting,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Distinction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Distinction, <hi>of the</hi> State of Things. This <hi>is</hi> Two-fold:
<list>
                  <item>1. The State of Things in the Spirit, or God.</item>
                  <item>2. The State of Things in the Flesh, or the Creature.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>You have this <hi>Distinction</hi> taught you, <hi>Heb. 2. 14. For as much, as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are made Partakers of Flesh and Blood.</hi> Here you have the <hi>Children before</hi>
their Clothing of Flesh and Blood; again you have the <hi>Children in</hi> that
Clothing. There is such another <hi>place</hi> as this, which expounds it, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by it, <hi>Rom. 8. 20, 21. The Creature was made subject to Vanity,
not willingly, but in Hope,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It shall be delivered into the glorious Liberty of the
Sons of God.</hi> Here is the Creature <hi>before, above, after</hi> the Vanity of this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the Liberty of the Sons of God. Here is the Creature <hi>under</hi> vanity,
and in the Corruptible Creation.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>State: The State of Things in the Spirit, or</hi> in God. This is a State of
Immortal Beauty, and Joys. <hi>All things live to God, Luk. 20. 38. To</hi> God,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49838:100"/>
that is, <hi>in</hi> God. <hi>All Things live to God,</hi> that is, as they are seen <hi>by</hi> God for all
things are seen by God, <hi>in</hi> God. God never looks <hi>off,</hi> or looks <hi>out</hi> from Himself.</p>
            <p>Rom. 8. 6. <hi>To be spiritually-minded is life and peace.</hi> All things live and
flourish to the spiritual mind, which is born of God, which is both the <hi>Eye</hi> and
<hi>Image</hi> of God in the Soul, as they do <hi>to God.</hi> He that hath the Eternal Spirit
for the <hi>Eye</hi> of his Mind, hath it also for the <hi>Object</hi> of his Mind. He that seeth
things <hi>by</hi> the Spirit, seeth them <hi>in</hi> the Spirit. All things <hi>in</hi> the Spirit are <hi>One</hi>
Spirit with that Spirit, Spiritual Appearances of the Spirit. So they are living
and pleasant Images of that Life and Peace which is the Activity and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>Rom. 11. 36, St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of God; <hi>Of him, and through him, and to him,
are all things; to whom be glory for ever, Amen.</hi> God is blessed for ever; the
Spring and Seat of Blessedness. All things cannot but be Branches of Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as they have their beginning, their way, their ends in him, who is the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Spirit of Blessedness and Glory.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>State. The State of things in the flesh,</hi> or in the creature, or in themselves.
This is a <hi>Flourishing, Fading,</hi> and <hi>Flaming</hi> State of Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have it described by St.</hi> Peter, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24. All Flesh is as Grass,
and all the Glory of the Flesh, as the Flower of the Field: the Grass withereth,
and the Flower thereof falleth away.</p>
            <p>All Things in the <hi>Flesh</hi> are, at best, Vanity, and change in their <hi>Principles.</hi>
Their <hi>Path</hi> is Corruption, their <hi>Conclusion</hi> is Consumption, as by Fire.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Second Distinction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Distinction: of the Life of Man. <hi>Man hath a</hi> Two-fold Principl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A Heavenly.</item>
               <item>2. An Earthly Principle.</item>
            </list>
            <p>This <hi>Distinction</hi> is laid down, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 45. The First Man Adam was
made a living Soul: the New Adam is a quickning Spirit. Adam</hi> is a <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi>
Name, which includes all Mankind; as in its Root, or Principle. The
<hi>Two Adams</hi> are the <hi>Two Principles,</hi> or distinct Roots of Man. One is a <hi>Living
Soul,</hi> the Soul of all Mankind in its Natural State. The other is a <hi>Quickning
Spirit,</hi> the Spirit, or Principle of men, as they are converted from Nature to
Grace, or Glory. These <hi>Principles</hi> are called by the Apostle in this place,
one <hi>Heavenly;</hi> the other <hi>Earthly.</hi> v. 47. <hi>The First Man is from the Earth;
the Second Man is the Lord from Heaven.</hi> v. 48. <hi>As is the Earthy, such
are they that are Earthy; as is the Heavenly, such are they that are Heavenly.</hi>
These <hi>Two Principles</hi> are likewise called <hi>Two Images,</hi> the Image of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
and of the Earthly Man. <hi>v. 49. As we have born the Image of the
Earthly, we shall also bear the Image of the Heavenly Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are likewise stiled in <hi>Scripture</hi> the <hi>Inward,</hi> and the <hi>Outward Man,</hi>
Corin. 2. 4, 14. <hi>Though our Outward Man perish, our Inward is renewed day
by day.</hi> The Heavenly Principle is as the <hi>Center;</hi> the Earthly, as a <hi>Point</hi> in
the <hi>Circumference</hi> shooting forth its Beams from thence only.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:49838:100"/>
The Heavenly, and Earthly Principle lie mutually infolded in one another.
The Earthly Principle is in the Heavenly, as the <hi>Seed</hi> in the full-blown Flower.
The Heavenly Principle is in the Earthly, as the <hi>Flower</hi> lies hid in the Seed.
The Earthly is in the Heavenly, as the Flowers of all <hi>Colours</hi> are in the
Light. The Heavenly is in the Earthly, as <hi>Light</hi> is in every Colour. These
Two are also expressed by the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Natural Man, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15.
So also by the <hi>New,</hi> and <hi>Old Man, Coloss.</hi> 3. 9, 10. Man according to the
Diversity of these <hi>Two Principles</hi> is capable of a <hi>Five-fold life</hi> at once.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Life of the Heavenly Principle in itself.</item>
               <item>2. The Life of the Earthly Principle, as it is Comprehended in the Heavenly.</item>
               <item>3. The Life of the Heavenly, as it is in the Earthly.</item>
               <item>4. The Life of the Earthly, as it is Subordinate to the Heavenly.</item>
               <item>5. The Life of the Earthly Principle in itself.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Life: The Life of the Heavenly Principle in itself.</hi> Man, as he lives this
Life, is uncapable of any blot of Sin, or spot of Sorrow. The <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks
with reference to this Life, <hi>Ephes. 5. 8. Now are ye Light in the Lord: Walk, as
Children of the Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As we live in the <hi>Heavenly Principle,</hi> and that lives in <hi>itself,</hi> we are Children
of Light; clear Beams of the God-Head, like Christ, Brightnesses of the
Fathers Glory, which can neither be Defiled, nor Darkned. <hi>That which is born
of God, sins not, nor cannot sin.</hi> I may add, it grieves not, nor cannot grieve, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its Heavenly Birth. In this Principle we are <hi>Light in the Lord.</hi>
Our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells us, that we shall be in the Resurrection, <hi>as the Angels.</hi> He
tells us again; that <hi>the Angels of Little Children behold the Face of God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
This Life in the Heavenly Principle is the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> In this we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
<hi>as Angels.</hi> While we are like little Ones on Earth; we are as the most
Glorious Angels, beholding the Face of our Father in Heaven: while we are
inclosed in the Darkness of Flesh, we are at the same time Light in the Lord.
It is the Opinion of some very learned men, that the Supream part of the Soul
which is above sensible Things, ever living in the midst of Invisible Things,
the Head, and Spirit of the Soul; that this is each Mans Angel.</p>
            <p>But man hath a <hi>Head</hi> above this Head. <hi>The Head of Man is Christ, as the
Head of Christ is God, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 3. Man hath a <hi>Spirit</hi> above this Spirit:
<hi>Whom I with my Spirit serve in the Gospel of his Son:</hi> Saith <hi>St. Paul, Rom.</hi> 1.
9. The Heavenly Principle is this <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> Thou hast an Eternal
Life in this Head, and Spirit of thine. In this Life thou art more than an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
in the midst of the Throne: thou art Light in the Lord: thou art in the
Light of the Lord, as He Himself is in that Light.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>First Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Life: The Life of the Earthly Principle, as it is Comprehended in the
Heavenly.</hi> The Earthly Principle in the Heavenly, is as the Heavenly. <hi>Behold,</hi> saith
<hi>Jesus Christ, I make all Things new, 2 Corin.</hi> 5. 17. As the Sun riseth upon
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49838:101"/>
the Earth; so doth the New Man upon the Old, making that also to have a
New Face of Immortality, as it is comprehended in the Beams of the New
Man. The Glory of God taking up <hi>Elijah,</hi> was as a Chariot of Fire, because
as it catcheth up, it changeth, and conforms to itself that which it catcheth up
into itself. Such is the Heavenly Principle taking up the Earthly into it.</p>
            <p>When St. <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up into the Third Heaven, and Paradise: then
he was <hi>another man. I knew a Man,</hi> saith he. <hi>Then</hi> he was that <hi>Man of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi>
If he was caught up in the Body: then was his Earthly Body a Paradisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Body, comprehended in the Body of Paradise. When he was let down
again, he was an Earthly Man in an Earthly Body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. The <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Poet tells us of an Herb, which had one Name among the Gods, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Name among Men. All the Things of this world, have one sort of
Names and Natures, as they are in their own Principle. But as they are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
and Converst with by a Heavenly Principle, they have quite other
Names, and Natures, which are Heavenly. As <hi>Adam,</hi> so each Principle gives
Names to all Things according to itself, and by those Names they are called
in that Principle. The Sickness, and Death of the Earthly Principle have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Names, Names of Life in the Heavenly Principle.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Second Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Life: The Life of the Heavenly Principle in the Earthly</hi> This is, as
the Life of Christ in the <hi>Flesh.</hi> It is the Life of the Son of God in Flesh.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Firmament,</hi> which divides between the Waters of Life above,
and the Waters of Grief, and Death below. It reacheth to both, and drinks
of both. It hath in its own Principle all the Springs of Peace, and Joy. But
as it is in one Person, and Principle with the Fleshly Man, it takes the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of that upon itself, and bears all its Diseases. And besides all, it hath one
Disease of its own, which the Earthly Man bears no part in, and that is, the
<hi>Imprisonment,</hi> Restraint, and Contradiction of Sins, and Sinners, which it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
in the Earthly Principle. The Heavenly Principle in the Earthly is both
the <hi>Primary Inflicter</hi> of all Sufferings, and the <hi>Principle afflicted</hi> by those Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Life: The Life of the Earthly Principle, as it is Subordinate to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly.</hi>
This is that <hi>Flesh</hi> of Christ, of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in the Mystery,
as of the Spouse of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 31, 32. This is that <hi>Spouse,</hi> which
though it have still a Head, a Principle of its own, yet it <hi>vails</hi> this Head, and
subordinates this Principle to the Heavenly Principle, as to its Husband, till it
be taken up into it, that so there may be no more <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female;</hi> but <hi>one
Man</hi> in Christ: no more <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> but all according to the New
<hi>Adam,</hi> a <hi>Quickning Spirit.</hi> This <hi>Flesh</hi> is indeed washt with pure water, that
it cannot sin. But it is Baptized unto <hi>Christ,</hi> as the Jews were unto <hi>Moses, 1
Cor.</hi> 10, 2. in the <hi>Cloud,</hi> and in the <hi>Sea.</hi> It is the <hi>Immediate,</hi> and <hi>Proper
Subject</hi> of all Sufferings. This is the <hi>Man,</hi> that saith, <hi>Lamen. 3. 1. I am
the Man that hath seen affliction by the Rod of his Wrath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:49838:101"/>
This is a <hi>Beast</hi> for <hi>Slaughter.</hi> But it is the <hi>Lamb</hi> among the Beasts. It is a
Lamb without Spot, which is slain all the day long. But it is slain, as a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
not as an <hi>Abomination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>Life: The Life of the Earthly Principle in itself.</hi> This is the <hi>Wild Ass</hi>
that runs, and snuffs up the Wind. This is the Seat of <hi>Sorrows,</hi> and the Pit
of <hi>Pollutions.</hi> St. <hi>Paul, Colos.</hi> 2. 11. calls this the <hi>Body of the Sins
of the Flesh.</hi> The <hi>Flesh,</hi> as it is in its own Principle is the Womb, and
Mother of all Evil. The Devil sows all his several Seeds in this Womb. So
the <hi>Body</hi> that springs forth from the Flesh, is the <hi>Devils Body,</hi> in which all the
Members are the several puttings forth of those various Seeds, and Divers
Principles of Evil cast by the Devil into the Flesh. These Principles are in
truth so many particular Devils in him, who is their Prince, and Head. The
<hi>Body of the Sins of the Flesh</hi> is then a <hi>Cluster</hi> of <hi>Devils Incarnated,</hi> in which
each Member in particular is a particular Devil in Flesh,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom. 6. 19. As ye have yielded your Members Servants</hi> (in a verse before
<hi>St. Paul</hi> called them <hi>Instruments) unto Uncleanness, and Iniquity,</hi> (that is, to
the Principle of Uncleanness, and Iniquity, which is the Devil) <hi>to Iniquity,</hi>
(that is, to make themselves one with that Principle, and the various Images,
or manifestations of the various Powers in that Principle:) <hi>so yield your Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
Servants</hi> to <hi>Righteousness,</hi> (that is, Jesus Christ the Righteousness of God)
<hi>unto Holiness.</hi> (to the pure, unmixt, unclouded holding forth of the several
vertues of Christ, thorow your several Members.) You see the Life of the
Earthly Principle in itself; that it is the <hi>Center,</hi> or <hi>Spring</hi> thorow which the
Prince of Darkness, and Devils thrusts forth all his Evil Powers, and Spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Body.</p>
            <p>By this means it is made the <hi>Beast,</hi> that bears the <hi>Whore;</hi> it is made an <hi>Ass,</hi>
which bows down its back to all the Burthens of every Devil, and Evil. Thus
much for the <hi>Distinctions,</hi> which concern the <hi>manner</hi> of our grieving. Now
follow the <hi>Rules</hi> which are drawn from these Distinctions to direct us in the
Spiritual manner of Mourning.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Rule:</hi> Know the <hi>Ground</hi> of your Mourning to be the <hi>Subordinate</hi> only,
and not the <hi>Supream Appearance</hi> of God, <hi>Psal. 30. 5. His anger endureth
but a moment; in his favour is Life: Weeping may endure for a Night, but Joy
comes in the Morning.</hi> When thou grievest, and lamentest most bitterly, then
remember; that this Discovery of God, which covers thee with so much Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
is but a momentary, and dark one; it is the Night, the Back-part of God.
The Morning-appearance, the Face of thy God is Bright, and Shining with
Joy. The Living, True, Eternal Discovery, which is above all other Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
is favourable, and kind. When thou lookest upon God, and takest the
Rise of thy Mourning at the highest: then say; <hi>my Soul, there is yet a Sight of
God higher than this, into which if thou couldst raise thy self, thou shouldst find
all their Love and Delight.</hi> It is a Rule among Divines, that there is no <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream</hi>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:49838:102"/>
Evil. Evil hath its Root in the Subordinate Manifestations of God, in
his Clothings, and Disguises. Travel on to the Naked Person, to the open Face
of God, and thou Travellest beyond all the Fountains, and Heads of Grief,
or Evil.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Rule:</hi> Understand well, that the <hi>Object</hi> of all Sorrow is the <hi>State of
Things in flesh,</hi> not <hi>in the Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> is the <hi>Ministry of Death, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
2 Cor. 3. 7. Sin</hi> comes in by <hi>Occasion of the Law, Rom.</hi> 7. 8.
The <hi>Law</hi> is the Occasion of Sin, and the ministry of Death by reason of the
<hi>Flesh, Rom. 8. 3. What the Law could not do</hi> (that is, to make us Holy, or
Happy,) <hi>thorow the weakness of the Flesh.</hi> The weakness of the <hi>Flesh</hi> is the
Ground, on which all wickedness, and woe is wrought.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Flesh</hi> is the Shadow, the Vail, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 20. Whatever evil is the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
of thy Grief, so grieve, as knowing it to be in the <hi>Shadowy</hi> part, in the
<hi>Out-side</hi> of Things only. 'Tis but a <hi>Leprosie in the Skin. Job</hi> calls the Fleshly
State of Things in themselves, and not in the Spirit, but <hi>Skin, Job</hi> 19. 26.
So doth the Devil in the <hi>Proverb: Skin for Skin.</hi> The Inside, the Substance,
the Spiritual; and Life-part of those Things, over which thou so sadly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
thy heart, is Peace. The Altar for Sacrifices was without the vail, all thy
Evils are without the vail, let thy griefs then abid without the vail, like the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of <hi>Abraham</hi> at the Foot of the Mount. But let thy Spirit enter within
the <hi>vail,</hi> and let <hi>Isaac</hi> only go thither with thee, the Child of Mirth, and Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Sea, and Storms are without the Vail, only in the <hi>Shadow.</hi> The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,</hi>
and the <hi>Rock; Rest</hi> is within the Vail, in the Spirit, and Truth of Things.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Rule: Grieve so, as having thy Head still above the Clouds of Grief in
a clear Light of Peace and Joy.</hi> Thy Head is Christ; thy Head is thy Heavenly
Principle, thy Life hid with Christ in God, <hi>Colos.</hi> 3. 3. This is your Head,
hiding itself in a Divine Light, and Glory, above all Storms and Changes.</p>
            <p>Divide your self then in your Sorrows. Let your grief be upon your <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi>
parts: but let your <hi>Head</hi> be in Joys. And as your Inferiour Parts are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to your Head: So let the Joys of that be, as the head of your Griefs.
They that are washt, need to have their Feet only washt; said our <hi>Saviour.</hi>
Let your <hi>Feet</hi> only be washt with Tears. And then remember, that the <hi>Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
of Glory, and the <hi>Oyl</hi> of gladness is upon your <hi>Heads.</hi> So mourn, as that
you may be like the Description of <hi>Christ, Revel.</hi> 1. 14. 15. that your <hi>Face</hi>
may <hi>shine</hi> like the Sun in its Strength, while your <hi>Feet</hi> are in the <hi>Furnace.</hi> Feel
your God stroaking your Head with his right hand, while his left hand is stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
your Feet with an Iron Rod of Affliction. See how <hi>Job</hi> in a Tempest
of Miseries yet Glories in his Head lift up above the Storm, <hi>Job 16. 18, 19. O
Earth cover not thou my Blood, and let my Cry have no place. Also now behold!
My Witnes is in Heaven, and my Record is on High.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When thy Tears and Blood run down upon the ground, when thy Cries fill
the Earth; then raise thy self like <hi>Job,</hi> and say: even now, behold! My Head
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49838:102"/>
is in Heaven, now I have a Life in my Heavenly Principle, which is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Record of my Glory, and Blessedness. This testifies of a Beauty, and Joy
to me in these very Sorrows.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Rule: Let the Heavenly Principle, as it lives in the Earthly, be the Spring
of your Sorrows.</hi> Let not thy Griefs be an <hi>Oppression</hi> to the Spiritual Man in
thee, but an <hi>Oblation</hi> from it. Thy Griefs will be an oppression to it, if they
proceed not from itself Originally. For then its Joys in the Flesh are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from it by another, by the Fleshly Principle. Thy Griefs are an Oblation
by the Spirit, when they flow <hi>Primarily</hi> from the Spirit. For then itself layeth
down its Joys, as Christ speaketh of his Life. The Blood, which our Saviour
shed, is called in Scripture <hi>the Blood of God.</hi> Though the Blood ran thorow
the Humane <hi>Nature.</hi> Yet the <hi>Person,</hi> or <hi>Principle,</hi> that bled in that Nature,
was God.</p>
            <p>Our Divinity ordinarily teacheth us this: that Christ was <hi>Man,</hi> that he might
<hi>Suffer; God,</hi> that he might <hi>Merit.</hi> His Blood had been of no value with God,
if it had not been the <hi>Blood of God.</hi> In like manner your Tears cannot be
Heavenly and Divine; if they be not the Tears of the Heavenly, and Divine
Principle in you. Though the Earthly Principle be as the <hi>Earth,</hi> in which
these bitter Waters bubble up, and run along: yet the Heavenly Principle must
be the <hi>Spring</hi> in this Earth, out of which they arise: Otherwise they will be
of no <hi>use</hi> to you, nor <hi>value</hi> with God.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Rule: Let the Mourning of your Earthly Principle be a Subordination,
and Submission to your Heavenly Principle.</hi> This makes your Sorrow a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
when without this your Mourning is but <hi>Murmuring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7. Jesus Christ is brought in speaking to God his Father:
<hi>Sacrifice, and Burnt-Offering thou wouldst not, but a Body hast thou prepared m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.
Then said I, lo I come, to do thy Will O God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Heavenly Principle speaks the same Language in every St. <hi>Thou
wilt have no more Sacrifices of Beasts. The Time is past, in which thou hast ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
pleasure to have the Inferiour Earthly Principle to be Sacrificed to,</hi> and <hi>by</hi> the
Superiour Heavenly Principle, while <hi>thine Image</hi> was present only in the Type,
and Shadow. But now thou hast prepared a Body for <hi>me,</hi> thou hast brought
me into the Earthly Principle, that I should make a <hi>Burnt-Offering</hi> of my self
to thee, as of my <hi>own Body.</hi> They were to bring no <hi>Strange Fire</hi> to the
Sacrifice, but to wait till Fire from Heaven fall down upon it and consume it.
In like manner is the Earthly man to lay itself on the Altar by the Power of
the Heavenly Man, and to wait, till that bring forth a Flame of Sorrow upon
it. The Earthly man should say alwaies to the Heavenly, <hi>I mourn, that I may
do thy Will, and not mine own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Est quaedam flere Libido.</hi> There may be a <hi>Lust</hi> in weeping, and so there is,
when the Outward Man fulfils his own will in weeping, and not the Will of
the Inward Man, which is one with the Will of Christ and God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:49838:103"/>
6. <hi>Rule: Let the Earthly Principle, as it is in itself, be only a Slave to you
in your Griefs.</hi> If the <hi>Flesh</hi> have a Power of its own to make you <hi>Grieve,</hi> to
qualifie, or measure your Griefs, it will bring the Curse of the <hi>Serpent</hi> upon
you: it will make you to go upon your Belly, to sink altogether into your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
and Corruptible Part. It will make you feed upon Dust, seek a merit in, and
a Nourishment from your Sorrows. When the Flesh hath Liberty to interpose it
self in our mourning, it makes our mourning <hi>Brutish,</hi> or <hi>Devilish.</hi> It makes our
mourning <hi>Brutish</hi> by deriving it from outward, and Temporal Things; by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
it on these. So our Lamentations are as the howl of Dogs, and cry of
Bears. It makes our mourning <hi>Devilish</hi> by mingling it with discontent, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair.
So the Roarings of our Spirits are like the yellings of Devils to Christ: <hi>Art
thou come to Torment us?</hi> The Flesh is to be kept as a <hi>Hewer of Wood,</hi> &amp; <hi>Drawer
of Water.</hi> We are to make use of the ways and weaknesses of it, to help to
break our Hearts, and bring forth Tears at the direction of the Spirit in us.</p>
            <p>The work of our Grief upon our Natural Part, as it is in itself, must be to
keep it under; to beat it as a <hi>Slave,</hi> to destroy it as an <hi>Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Ass,</hi> which is not for <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but to have its neck broke, except
it be redeemed by its Subordination to the Spiritual Part.</p>
            <p>I have done speaking of the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Mourning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the <hi>Third Particular</hi> in the opening of the Nature of this
<hi>Grief,</hi> which is the <hi>Measure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Measure</hi> of Spiritual Grief hath <hi>Three Limits.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Limit: The casting out of Filth.</item>
               <item>2. Limit: The casting down of Flesh.</item>
               <item>3. Limit: The clearing up of the Face of God towards us.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. Limit: The casting out of Filth. <hi>St.</hi> Paul 1 Corin. 5. 3. <hi>in the case
of the incestuous Person blames the Church, that</hi> they had not mourned, that
he, who had done this Thing might be cast out from among them.</p>
            <p>The Case is the same in our own Persons. We are to mourn, that every
Evil Thing may be cast out of us. We are to keep our Hearts in a melting
temper, till our Lusts be quite melted down, till the Gold, and the Dross be
separated one from another. We are to weep, till we have washed our selves
clean in our Tears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you may here ask: What Power is there in our Tears, or Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
to cleanse us from our Filth, shall we say with the <hi>Papist,</hi> that our mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
merits Grace, if not of <hi>Desert,</hi> yet for desire, out of <hi>Congruity?</hi> Or shall
we say with the <hi>Arminian,</hi> that our griefs are a <hi>moral</hi> way of working upon
our will, to mortifie that, and make it weary of the Pleasures of Sin, for the
Pennance of Sorrow?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer to this, that there is neither any <hi>merit</hi> in the Tears of
any Creature to move God; For if thou be Righteous, it is to thy self.
And the Heavens with all their Hosts are Folly, and Filth before Him:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:49838:103"/>
Neither is there any <hi>Efficacy</hi> in the woes of man to purge the will of man.
For <hi>who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean?</hi> Can any one redeem his
Brother from Death? Can one Passion or affection in Man by a Death in Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
redeem his Brother, another Passion, or affection from the Death of Sin?
<hi>They must let this alone for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Spiritual Griefs of a Saint are the Buddings of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod, of the
the Cross of the Lord Jesus in him. And from hence they have their <hi>value</hi>
with God, and their <hi>Vertue</hi> on us.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First, my Sorrows have a value with God,</hi> as they are the Sufferings of
my Saviour in me. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, 1 <hi>Colos. 24. I rejoyce in my
Sufferings, while I fill up that which is behind of the Afflictions of Christ in my
Flesh for his Bodies sake.</hi> All the Sufferings of Believers are the Sufferings
of Christ propagating themselves thorow his mystical Members. We are one
Spirit with our Lord Jesus in our Tribulations as well as in our Consolations.
Our Groans, as much as our Gloryings, are the Breathings of that Spirit. As
the Soul is all in all the Parts of the Body, making every Member a part of
the Humane Nature, putting upon it the Beauty of that Nature: So is Jesus
Christ in every Thing of the actings, or Sufferings of Christ any where,
giving a Divine Beauty, and worth to it, by vertue of the Union.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Corin. 4. 10. Always bearing about in my Body the Dying of the Lord
Jesus, that the Life of the Lord Jesus may be made manifest in my Body:</hi> This
St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself. The Tears from our eyes are the Blood from the
Heart of the Lord Jesus. Though not as <hi>our Tears,</hi> yet as <hi>his Blood,</hi> they have
Power with God to bring forth his life in us. Jesus Christ dies over again in
thy griefs; that so he may act his Resurrection over again in thy Graces. The
Father makes a Promise to the Lord Jesus, <hi>Es. 53. 10. When he shall make his
Soul an offering for Sin, he shall he see his Seed.</hi> This is an Everlasting Covenant
between the Father, and the Son, that when he hath descended to the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
parts of the Earth, he should then begin to ascend.</p>
            <p>When the Image of the Invisible God hath put itself off into the Strange
Forms of Darkness, and Death; then is it to spring up again out of these, and
again to behold itself in its own proper shape and power, which is its Seed.
Thy Saviour, and Husband makes his Soul an Offering, for Sin in all the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of thy Soul. Therefore mayest thou now challenge it of the Father in
the name of Jesus Christ, that he may see in thee his Seed, which is the Power
of an endless Life. Thou mayest say; behold, O my God! by him, whose
the Signet, and the Staff is; the Glory and Power of thy God-Head; by him
am I in these Pangs and Sorrows. Let then a Man-child be born in my Heart,
which may be called after his name, that I may rejoyce in it, and remember
my Sorrow no more. Thy <hi>Benjamin</hi> is come before thee into the Land of
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> as thy servant in my servitude. Thy <hi>Darling</hi> hath brought himself
into my guilt, and griefs; he stands before thee in them. The <hi>Lamb</hi> of God
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49838:104"/>
a slain in my sufferings. O then let it be a <hi>Passover,</hi> that the evil Angel of
Lust and Misery may pass from the house of my Spirit, when he sees the blood
of this Lamb in my Tears sprinkled upon the Posts of the Door.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, Our Sorrows have a vertue on us, as they are the Sufferings of
Iesus Christ in us. <hi>Galat.</hi> 6. 14. God forbid, <hi>saith</hi> Paul, that I should glory
in any thing, save in the Cross of our Lord Iesus, by which the world is crucified
to me, and I to the World.</p>
            <p>As the Person of Christ is the Seed of God, which springs up into many
Sons to God: so is the Cross of the Lord Jesus a Seed that remains not alone,
but brings forth much Fruit. It grows up into a multitude of Crosses, a Cross
in each good Heart, a Cross in every Creature of this world. This Cross of
Christ is the wisdom and Power of God making themselves first the <hi>Tree of the
Curse,</hi> on which all the Principles, and Spirits of this world must hang: Then
the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> bringing forth the Fruits of <hi>Paradise,</hi> and the <hi>Third Heaven.</hi>
Every care or cross in a Saint is this Cross of his Saviour sprouting in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> lies hid in each Tear, in each sigh of a Holy Spirit. He
is there, as the Seed falling into the Earth, and Dying. By this Death he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
himself from Death in thy Heart, and breaks out on every side into Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of his Grace and Glory.</p>
            <p>Say of thy Trouble; <hi>why art thou cast down O my Soul?</hi> This is that Death
of my Saviour in me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which he destroys the power of Death in my Spirit,
Sin and the Devil. This is the way in which thou shalt praise him, and see
him swallowing up the Principle of Darkness in Darkness, that he may bring
forth himself in the Light of his Countenance, to be the Light of thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
I have been the larger in this Objection, that so I may be the more
clearly understood both in this, and in the following Particulars. Whatever
mention is made of any Beauty, or Grace in a Saint, is not to be imputed to
the Saint, but to the Grace, and Face of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in him: so is the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
or Efficacy of our mourning, the Discovery of our dying Saviour in it.
No Persons, no Sorrows are Spiritual, if they be not one Spirit with Jesus Christ.
But thus much for the First limit in the measure of our Sorrows, the casting
out of Filth.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Limit: The casting down of the Flesh, 1 Cor. 9. 27. I,</hi> saith the
Apostle, <hi>keep under my body, and bring it into Subjection.</hi> The words are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>I beat it black and blew,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I make it to serve.</hi> The end, and
so the bound of Humiliation is <hi>First</hi> to bring down the Principle of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Man into a Principle of Darkness, that it may no more put forth itself
in its own Light and Life. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to subdue that Principle to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Principle, that it may be quite slain in itself, and revived in the Spiritual
Man a Spiritual Principle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Natural Man, <hi>this body of Death,</hi> or <hi>the
body of this Death.</hi> It is a body of Death in a Two-fold sense.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:49838:104"/>
               <hi>First, Thy Outward Man is the shadow of Death cast upon thy Spirit.</hi> It is
the Valley of the Shadow of Death thorow which thou walkest here below.
Thou art in the Body sunk down to the borders of Death, being already
come within the shadow of it. The whole face of things upon thy Person,
and round about thee, is a dead Image, and the Image of Death: For he,
who hath the Power of Death, hath entred into it with his Principality, and
taken away the true Life of it, setting it up now, as an Appearance in,
and of <hi>himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Thy Outward Man is a Body of Death, because it is appointed to
Death.</hi> The Body by one Death hath brought it self out of the Divine Life
into the Power of Darkness, into a Hellish Root. Now by another Death it
must be broken off from this Root, and brought back again into an Eternal
Stock. Our mourning then must last, while we are in the Body of this Death,
till this be no more <hi>this Body,</hi> but perish in Death. The Devil cast us out of
our Innocency, and from the face of God; he set up himself, by setting up the
Natural Man in it self. We were turn'd out of <hi>Paradise,</hi> when we came into
<hi>this Body,</hi> which is now the <hi>Beast's skin. Again,</hi> By the Ruine of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Man, we must raise the Building of God, and cast down the Devil. By
putting off the Beast's skin, by the dissolution of the Tabernacle of Beasts skins
in Death, we return into <hi>Paradise.</hi> We are therefore to go mourning to our
Graves.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Limit: The clearing of the face of God towards us, Matth.</hi> 9. 15. Our
Saviour tells the Jews, <hi>That his Disciples could not fast while the Bridegroom
was with them. But the Bridegroom should be taken away. And then they should
fast in those days. The Face of God</hi> in Jesus Christ, is the Soul's <hi>Bridegroom.</hi>
Who, that is the Bride of this Bridegroom, can take joy in any thing, when
this Face is withdrawn and hid from him? Shall not our Souls fast from the
Freedom and Fulness of Natural Delights, when our Spirits are made to fast
from the Beauties and Delicacies of <hi>Jesus Christ?</hi> This is the season of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
It is now beautiful to see a holy Soul Widow-like, with a Vail upon the
face of all her Glory and Content; when her God is gone a great Journey
from her. What can she do but mourn, when he is absent, who was the <hi>Light</hi>
of her Eyes, the <hi>Anointing</hi> of her Face and Head? What can set an end to
her mournings, till <hi>he return,</hi> and wipe away all Tears from her Eyes, by
<hi>setting</hi> himself in the Eye of her Spirit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Psal. 30. 7. Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled,</hi> saith <hi>David.</hi> Will
it not be Winter when your Sun is gone? Can you expect a Spring, till he
turns toward your Earth again? Is it not the Presence of the <hi>Lord Jesus,</hi> that
makes all things fresh, and full of Beauty round about thee? When he is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,</hi>
who was the <hi>Image</hi> of God in them, do not all things <hi>droop</hi> and <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish</hi>
in thine Eyes? Canst thou then chuse but languish with them? If the
<hi>Lord Jesus</hi> be the <hi>Root</hi> of thy Spirit, and his Spirit the <hi>Sap</hi> of thy Comforts,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49838:105"/>
thou wilt grieve in his <hi>absence</hi> without arguments to persuade thee to it; as
naturally, as <hi>Flowers</hi> nipt with Frosts <hi>hang</hi> the head. Nay no arguments will
be able to raise thee to any degree of chearfulness, except <hi>he come,</hi> and make
himself the <hi>argument.</hi> When thy Corruptions, like Fogs from the Earth,
have gathered into Clouds, which hide the Heaven of thy Lords Face from
thee: weep then, till these Clouds be again dissolv'd by the Showers of thy
Tears, and so thy <hi>Jesus</hi> again discover himself over thee as a clear sky.</p>
            <p>I have done with the <hi>Third</hi> particular in the Nature of Spiritual mourning,
which was the measure of it.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The Mystery.</hi> The Mystery of every thing is in God, <hi>Ephes. 3. 9. the
Mystery hid in God who created all Things by Jesus Christ.</hi> This is the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Things, their ground, their beginning, and end in the Person of God
and Christ. Neither can we be Spiritual in any thing any further than we see
the Mystery of it, and stand in the Mystery.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mystery</hi> of a holy Grief is Threefold.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Mystery: Conformity to Iesus Christ.</item>
               <item>2. Mystery: Complyance with the Will of God.</item>
               <item>3. Mystery: The Compleating of our Persons.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Mystery: Conformity to Jesus Christ.</hi> We read, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 4, 5. that
<hi>we were chosen in Christ before the Foundation of the world: We were predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
to the Adoption of Children by Jesus Christ.</hi> We sprung up in Eternity,
in the Heart of God, out of the Person of the Lord Jesus there, as <hi>Images</hi> of
him, who as he rose up in the Divine Nature, the essential Image of it, was
Fruitful from the Root of that Nature according to the Power of Life, and
Store of Spirit in it. So he multiplied himself by the strength of the Father
into many such Images in the heart, and thoughts of God. <hi>Thus we were
chosen in, and by him.</hi> Thus also we were <hi>chosen to be Conformed to the Image
of this Son, as</hi> you shall read, <hi>Rom. 8. 29. Whom he did foreknow, he did
also predestinate to be conform'd to the Image of his Son.</hi> The Fathers fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of us in his Son, was the ground of our predestination by him, and
conformity to him. A chief part in Christ is the dark part, his Sufferings, a
chief part of our Conformity to him lies in our Sufferings and Sorrows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom. 8. 17. Joynt-heirs with Christ, if so be we suffer with him, that we
may be also glorified together.</hi> Our whole inheritance is our conformity to the
Lord Jesus. This Inheritance lies as well in Suffering, as in being glorified.
We have a <hi>double interest in Christ: One in the Unity of his Spirit: Another
in the variety of his Body.</hi> According to our <hi>First</hi> interest we are one with
Christ, that is, by the Unity of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. So we are to have
the fulness of Christs Sufferings form'd over again upon our Persons in the
Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10. According to our <hi>Second</hi> interest in the Body of
Christ we are only particular members, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. In this particular
membership a particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Sufferings pertains to us, according to our
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49838:105"/>
place in the Body. The portion of sorrow allotted to every Saint in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
is as much inferiour to the miseries of our Blessed Saviour, as that
Member is inferiour to the Head. But for this reason the Providence of God
leads us to occasions of sorrow, and then opens in us a spring of Sorrow, that
we may <hi>fulfil our measure in the sufferings of Christ,</hi> Col. 1. 21. This is the
<hi>first Mystery</hi> of our Griefs, our Conformity to Christ; that we may be Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
Spouses and Members of Christ.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Mystery. Our Complyance with the Will of God.</hi> We mourn, that we
may be like Christ; <hi>Brethren</hi> grown up from one Root with him; <hi>Spouses</hi>
drawn forth from his side, <hi>Bone</hi> of his Bone, <hi>Flesh</hi> of his Flesh; <hi>Principle</hi> of
his Principle, <hi>Image</hi> of his Image; <hi>Strength</hi> of his Strength; <hi>Weakness</hi> of his
Weakness. But now you may ask, what the mystery of all sufferings and
griefs are, as they are Christ's first, and so ours?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. I answer</hi> to that by a place of Scripture, <hi>Heb. 5. 8. Though he were
a Son, yet learned he Obedience by the things which he suffered.</hi> There are Two
Waies of Learning; one <hi>Speculative,</hi> in the Contemplations of the Spirit; the
other <hi>Practical</hi> in the Conformity of the Person. There are Two Waies of
Obedience; one in the <hi>Will,</hi> being prepared, and ready to all things; the other
in the <hi>Work</hi> of Doing or Suffering, being actually undertaken, and thorowly
undergone. Our <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> was ever in all things obedient to his Father, so
far as that State in which he was, would permit. While he liv'd in Heaven,
he was obedient to the Death, in the Contemplations of his Mind, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of his Will, so far as these two Wings could carry him.</p>
            <p>But all this while, the Devil might say of <hi>Jesus,</hi> as he did of <hi>Job;</hi> He dyes
for his Father in his Speculations, and Purposes at a distance; while his Father
maintains a hedge of Life, and Joys round about him; while he sees not
Death, but as Death it self is a living and beautiful Image in a Prospect of
Glory. Therefore <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is brought down into Flesh, that he may
try, and so experimentally learn another way of suffering, by an Actual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
into the Power of Darkness, and Misery, as it is in its own Principle.
Our <hi>Father</hi> could have prevented the Rising up of the Spring, or Principle of
Sin in the Heart of the creature: So he could have cut off all occasions of
sorrow or suffering: He could have taken away Sin by a change, and not by
a Death; <hi>Transfiguring</hi> instead of <hi>Crucifying</hi> us; and this too, by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Person resting upon us in a White Cloud, and taking us up in it self,
without its Descent into the Dark Cloud of this earthly Body. Thy Father
could restrain the Issues of Lust in thee, which send forth so much Filth, upon
which we pour forth so many Tears. So our Tears might have been spared.
But if all this had been, where had been the Testimony of our Obedience to
the Father? There are <hi>Two</hi> Waies of Obeying God: <hi>One in the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
of his Will, and ours; the other, in a contradiction between his Will and
ours.</hi> A holy Spirit obeys God the <hi>first</hi> way in Heaven and Joys. For there it
takes up its Joys, and tasts a Sweetness in them, much more out of <hi>Obedience,</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:49838:106"/>
than <hi>Appetite;</hi> because they are the <hi>Will</hi> of God, rather than because they <hi>agree</hi>
with its own will.</p>
            <p>But we obey God the <hi>Second</hi> way on Earth in Afflictions. In Heaven we
give up our will to be swallowed up in the Will of God, as a River in the
Sea. In our Sorrows we Sacrifice our wills to the Will of God, as the
Beasts were Sacrificed by their Death, and by Fire. So <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> when his
will was at the height of contrariety to the Will of God according to its own
proper inclination; <hi>If it be possible, let this Cup pass from me.</hi> Yet then he cut
the Throat of his will, and laid it panting upon the Altar, to be wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
in the dreadfullest way, in the Fire of divine wrath and vengeance. Thou
in all thy Griefs accomplishest the same Mystery after the same manner. Thou
<hi>Feastest</hi> the will of the Father by the <hi>Fast</hi> of thine own will. Thou <hi>obeyest</hi> thy
God, and servest his <hi>Pleasure</hi> by the <hi>binding,</hi> and <hi>Offering</hi> up of thy <hi>Isaac,</hi> all
thy Pleasures.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Mystery: The Compleating of our Persons.</hi> This is yet a Further, and
the utmost depth in the Mystery of our Sorrows. The Scripture holds it forth
in the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> as the <hi>Pattern;</hi> in our Persons, as the <hi>Copies</hi> of that
Pattern. We read of <hi>Jesus Christ, Heb</hi> 2. 10. that, <hi>he was made Perfect
through Sufferings.</hi> That is Perfect, which hath all parts belonging to it. It
belonged to the Person of Jesus Christ to act all parts, to appear in all shapes.
For he was to be the <hi>dwelling place of all Fulness, 1 Colos.</hi> 19. He was to
<hi>unfold the manifold wisdom of God in his own Person, Ephes.</hi> 3. 10. He came
forth as <hi>the Word,</hi> to make a full and distinct expression of God. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God is the <hi>Glass,</hi> in which all Natures are first formed, and seen. The
Natures of Light and Darkness, Shame and Glory, Joy and Misery; to say
all, the Natures of Love and Wrath, the two Contrary heads of all distinct
Natures are Originally in God according to their Eternal <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <hi>First Forms.</hi>
If <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> had not come forth into all these Forms, and taken upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
these several Natures in their utmost varieties, and contrarieties: he had
wanted some parts belonging to his Person, and been imperfect in his <hi>Relation,</hi>
as a Son, a Saviour; in his <hi>Office</hi> as a Representer, a Reconciler. Therefore, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> witnesseth, <hi>He descended first to the lowermost Parts of the Earth,</hi> then
<hi>He ascended above all Heavens,</hi> and that for this reason; <hi>that He might fill
All: Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s.</hi> 4. 10. Thus he was made <hi>perfect by Sufferings. The descent of
Christ</hi> was the <hi>drawing</hi> of the Picture of the God-Head upon him in its lowest
and outermost Mysteries, or wonders of Glory; in its <hi>Back-parts</hi> or <hi>Feet. The
Ascent,</hi> was the <hi>Uniting</hi> of the lowest to the highest: the <hi>bringing</hi> of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermost
into the bosom of the Innermost: the <hi>drawing</hi> up of the Feet into the
Bed, into the rest, and Glory of the head. The <hi>Scripture</hi> holds forth the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of the same <hi>Mystery</hi> in our Persons after the same manner. <hi>Jesus
Christ</hi> went thorow these Sufferings, as our <hi>Captain,</hi> that he might lead us the
<hi>same way</hi> to the <hi>same end;</hi> that he might bring us, as Sons to inherit the same
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49838:106"/>
Glory; to fulfil all Righteousness, all the goings forth of the God-Head in our
selves thorow Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>James c. 1. v.</hi> 2, 4. exhorts the Saints to <hi>account it all Joy, when they
fall into all manner of Temptations:</hi> and to <hi>let Patience have her perfect work,</hi>
which would make <hi>them Perfect, entire, wanting nothing.</hi> We were brought
forth upon the uppermost parts, the Face of the Earth in <hi>Paradise.</hi> Let
us now with <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> go down into the <hi>Deep,</hi> to the lowermost parts of the
Earth, by Sufferings and Sorrows. Let us patiently endure till we are carried
thorow all the Chambers of Death, and the innermost corners of that Cave
of Darkness; till we be carried out of all, up into Heaven: So we shall be
clothed with all the <hi>Wonders</hi> of God, and have his manifold <hi>Wisdom,</hi> his <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
displaid in our Persons as his Sons also, together with our Saviour. Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then Travel thorow the valley of <hi>Baca,</hi> of Mourning, and Lamentation;
as the way of <hi>Perfection,</hi> the <hi>Accomplishment</hi> of the <hi>Mystery</hi> of God in you.
Now I have performed the <hi>first</hi> part of my promise, which was to speak of
<hi>the Nature of Spiritual Mourning.</hi> There remains behind, the <hi>Second</hi> part of
my promise, which is to speak of <hi>the Mixture of Spiritual Mirth, and Spiritual
Mourning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will direct you to this Mixture by <hi>Five Rules:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Rule: So grieve, as giving Glory to God in your Griefs.</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31.
<hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ye <hi>Mourn</hi> or be <hi>merry,</hi> let <hi>both</hi> be to the Glory of God. <hi>Mourn</hi> not, as
questioning the <hi>Sweetness</hi> in the <hi>Will</hi> of God, the <hi>Wisdom</hi> in the <hi>Counsels</hi> of
God, the <hi>Strength</hi> in the <hi>Power</hi> of God, the <hi>Beauty</hi> in the <hi>Face</hi> of God, the
<hi>Pleasures</hi> in the <hi>Person</hi> of God, the <hi>Infiniteness</hi> in <hi>all.</hi> Grieve not to the <hi>Clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
but the <hi>clearing</hi> of the Appearances of God in your Spirit. Let not your
Sorrows be as <hi>a troubled Sea,</hi> but as a <hi>Sea of Christal,</hi> thorow which you may
see the glorious face of God. As the Beams of the Sun shining thorow red
Glass, so will the glory of God be appearing thorow your Sorrows. It will
beget a <hi>Pleasantness</hi> in your <hi>bloodiest</hi> Pangs.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Rule: Let your Mourning raise, not ruine the Life of the Spiritual Man
in you. Though the Outward Man perishes, the Inward Man is renewed day by
day, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 16. Let your Sorrows weigh down the Natural Man only,
as <hi>one</hi> of the Buckets, that the Spiritual Man as the <hi>other</hi> of the Buckets, may
be lifted up. If that Life which is Light in the Lord, be lifted up by your
Griefs, It will draw up your Person, and your Griefs themselves into the
Pleasantness of its own Light.</p>
            <p>3. Rule: Mourn in the Name of Christ, Colos. 3. 17. Whatsoever ye do in
Word, or Deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Iesus. The Name of the Lord
Iesus <hi>wraps up</hi> Four Things <hi>in it, which I shall express by</hi> Four Rules <hi>in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Mourn in the Power of Christ,</hi> The Power of Christ is the Power of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:49838:107"/>
Eternal Life, which carries an unexpressible sweetness along with it, even then,
when it goes forth into the saddest operations. Thy Tears will be a Spiritual
Wine, if they be the Fruit of this Vine.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Mourn in the Image of Christ.</hi> Every thing is delightful to us, which
brings our well-beloved into our Thoughts, though it be, but as a Picture, or
Shadow of him. Love delights in likeness, especially to be itself made like
that which it loves. This will make thy Sorrows <hi>Comfortable</hi> to thy Heart,
and <hi>Glorious</hi> in thine Eye, if thou <hi>Transferrest</hi> them upon thy self, as in a <hi>Figure
of Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Meurn for Christ.</hi> Make him the end of thy Sorrows. <hi>Christ is the end
of the Law for Righteousness sake, Rom.</hi> 10. 4. Let <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> be the end of
thy Griefs for thy Joys sake. <hi>The End puts a Loveliness, and Pleasantness upon
the means, and way to it.</hi> If thy Sorrows be for Self, and from Self-love: they
will be like <hi>Brine,</hi> they will have a <hi>Gnawing, Burning</hi> Saltness in them. But if they
be for thy Saviour, and from his Love, they will be <hi>Fresh,</hi> and <hi>Sweet</hi> on thy
Spirit, as the <hi>Dew</hi> of Heaven on the tender Grass.</p>
            <p>4. Mourn, as in Union with the Person of Christ. <hi>A</hi> Sai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t <hi>is a Name
of</hi> Anointing, <hi>which signifies</hi> Two in one; <hi>the</hi> Ointment, <hi>or Oyl, and the</hi> Anointed:
the Sanctifier, and the Sanctified. He that Sanctifies, and they that are Sanctified
are of one, Heb. 2. 11. <hi>They must also be in One. Our Griefs are never</hi>
Saintlike, <hi>or Holy; if they be not in</hi> Consort, <hi>and</hi> Fellowship <hi>with</hi> Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rom. 8. 17. Joint-heirs with Christ, if so be we suffer with him.</hi> Our Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
are a <hi>Murther,</hi> not a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> they are to <hi>Death,</hi> not to <hi>Life;</hi> if they be not
in Union with <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> If they be in Union with Christ, that Union unites a
<hi>Sweetness,</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>These are the Branches of the Third Rule.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Rule: Let your Grief be a Grace.</hi> If your Grief be from Nature only, it
is carnal, not spiritual; it is such a <hi>Death,</hi> as is a <hi>Sowing to the Flesh,</hi> which will
bring forth Corruption, and Death. <hi>Whatever is not of Faith is Sin, Rom.</hi> 14.
23. If your <hi>Mourning</hi> be not a <hi>Grace</hi> in you, one of the <hi>Daughters</hi> of Faith,
which is the mother of all Grace: it is <hi>Sin,</hi> and to be resisted by you, as the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>
But if your <hi>Mourning</hi> be <hi>Gracious,</hi> then it is a <hi>Sowing</hi> to the Spirit, of
which you shall <hi>reap Immortality</hi> Such <hi>Tears</hi> are <hi>Precious Seed,</hi> Spiritual Seed,
which have the Sweet Rellish, and Power of Immortal Life in them.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Rule: Let your Mourning be in God. In him,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul of God, we
live, and move, and have our Being, Acts</hi> 17. 28. It is true Naturally of all
men. It is much more true of Saints in a Spiritual sense. We live the life of
Grace, we Mourn, we have our Spiritual Being and Motions in God. A <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Man have their <hi>Being</hi> in <hi>God</hi> after a <hi>different</hi> manner. <hi>A Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Man</hi> hath his Being in God, as he is the <hi>Principle</hi> of the First Creation,
in which he is as in Thick Darkness. <hi>A Spiritual Man</hi> hath his Being in God,
as God is <hi>in Christ, who is the Brightness</hi> of the Glory of God. <hi>Abide in me,</hi>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:49838:107"/>
saith <hi>Christ,</hi> that is in the Brightness of the Glory of God, and <hi>ye shall bring
forth much Fruit, John</hi> 15. 4. 5.</p>
            <p>If you will bring forth your <hi>Tears,</hi> as <hi>Fruit</hi> to God, you must weep in the
midst of the Glory, and Joys of the Divine Nature. <hi>God</hi> in his Naked Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
must be the Stage, on which you must act the saddest part of your Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.
What Part will not such a Stage, and Scene of Delights make Pleasant?</p>
            <p>If thou <hi>mournest right,</hi> thou art <hi>in God,</hi> while thou mournest, thou <hi>seest</hi>
nothing below, above, on every side of thee, but the <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Curious Work</hi>
of his Glory. Will not this <hi>Guild</hi> thy Grief, and put a chearfulness upon it?</p>

               <p>THis Psalm is believed to be composed upon the same occasion with the
<hi>Canticles;</hi> The Marriage between <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Daughter of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi>
which is made by the Holy Ghost, a Type of the Mystical Espousals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Lord Jesus, and a Holy Soul. The Eternal Spirit delights to play
with itself, casting from its Heavenly person the shaded Light of this Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then filling every part of it, even the darkest, with figures of its own
Sweetnesses, and Beauties. Strange Wives were charged upon <hi>Solomon,</hi> as a
Mother-Sin big with many hateful Birth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Yet this cloudy piece of Providence
is a Vail curiously wrought with the Divine Images of Christ on the Throne,
his Queen all in beaten Gold at his Right Hand with their pure, immortal
Lovelinesses, Loves, and mutual Joyes; under which Vail lies hid the Living
Face itself of all these Glories.</p>
               <p>Prov. 25. 2. <hi>It is the Glory of God to conceal a thing: but the Glory of
Kings to search out a matter.</hi> It runs thus in the Original: It is the Glory of
God to conceal the <hi>Word:</hi> but the Glory of Kings to search out the <hi>Word.</hi> It
is a height of Glory beyond the Compass of every created Understanding, the
hiding of the eternal Word, which is brighter infinitely than ten thousand Suns
all joined into One, under a vail slighter, and thinner, than the most empty
shadow, to form the Picture of this Glorious Word upon every part of the
shadow, and then again to vail that also with the Darkness of the Shade.</p>
               <p>But this is the Glory of Jesus Christ, to bring down these Mysterious
heights, and make them familiar to the Eye of the Creature. It is an Eye of
Glory in the Saints, those Fellow-Kings to Jesus Christ, by which they disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Picture in the shade, the ravishing depths of the Life itself in the Pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
and make it their Royal Entertainment to converse continually with the
Beauties, and Sweetnesses of the Divine nature in them both invisible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
senses.</p>
               <p>This Psalm is entituled, <hi>A Song of Loves.</hi> The sweetest <hi>Matter</hi> exprest in
the sweetest <hi>Manner.</hi> Both are a Divine Harmony. The Loves here are a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the most Heavenly, and most Spiritual <hi>Hearts.</hi> The Song the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the most Heavenly, and most Spiritual <hi>Voices.</hi> The Loves figure out
the Father, the pure, unfathomed, unconfined Spring of Unity, and Sweetness,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49838:108"/>
where all things lie embracing each other in their first, and softest Bed: The
Song represents the shining Word, the harmonious Wisdom, the Essential Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
Beauty and Image of the Godhead, the Son, in whom all the Riches of
Love are with an equal Richness, and Loveliness displaid. The Song of Loves,
these Loves thus sung, this Marriage of Love, and Loveliness paint out to us
the Joyes and Glories of the Thrid Person the Holy Ghost. But by whom was
this Song sung? Some read; <hi>The Song of the beloved Virgins.</hi> These are the
friends of the Bridegroom, and the Bride, which sing the <hi>Epithalamium,</hi> or
Marriage-Song. In the <hi>Canticles</hi> they are called, <hi>The Daughters of Jerusalem,</hi>
which some Interpreters understand to be the <hi>Holy Angels.</hi> Angelical Spirits
are expressed by the name of Virgins very fitly: 1. For the preservation of their
native sweetness, their primitive beauty, the flower of the Divine Image i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
them uncorrupt, untainted. 2. For their single Estate, being separate from
mixture, and union with any sorts of Earthly Bodies below them, and not yet
raised to a marriage with the Divine Body, the Substance, and Fulness of the
God-Head in Jesus Christ; because they are the fairest, softest, and sweetest Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of all created Things. It is the manner of the Hebrew Tongue to express
the Beauty, and Loveliness of things by the feminine Sex. The Woman is the
Glory of the Man. Christ the Brightness of the Fathers Glory is represented
in this Form by the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> above, the Mother of us all. In the Proverbs he
is figured by a Virgin-Queen in her Pallace, his Angels as Maidens attending
on this Virgin-Queen, and sent forth by her to invite her guests. Thus sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and Angelical Spirits, those invisible Beauties, which are the immediate
Copies and Springs of all visible things, as also the Mark, and White to which
the activity and operations, of all natural Principles, as Arrows are directed,
be known by the names of Nymphs, and Virgins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hn the Baptist</hi> was the Restorer of the Law, the proper Ministry of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
which was ministred by Angels, and by which only the Angelical Life
and Glories, as figures of the Divine, were ministred to us. He therefore is called
by the Holy Ghost, <hi>An Angel going before the Lord to prepare his way.</hi> He
speaks of himself, as a Friend of the Bridegroom, rejoicing to hear his voice,
and making one in the Quire of Angels, which sing to the Bridegroom, and
the Bride, while they lie on Beds of Glory in the embraces of each others Love.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Angels</hi> are those <hi>Friends,</hi> which Jesus Christ calleth upon, in his Song
of Songs, when he comes into his Spouse's Garden, <hi>Cant. 5. 1. I have drunk
my Wine with my Milk, Eat O Friends, Drink, be enebriated with Loves.</hi> St.
<hi>Paul</hi> expounds this Scripture, <hi>Eph. 3. 10. That unto the Principalities, and
Power in Heavenly places might be known by the Church the manifold Wisdom of
God.</hi> The Hearts, and the Lips of the Spouse of Christ; the Marriage-Union
between Christ and a saint, in the spiritual and Heavenly Image, is the Golden
Cup, out of which the Angels drink in rich Discoveries of God, the Glories
and sweetnesses of the Divine Nature, which are there poured forth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:49838:109"/>
from their Fountain, which are that Wine of Love, with which Christ,
and his Spouse entertain each other. O the Dignity! O the Delights of a
Holy Soul! Angels sing to it; Angels pry into its Beauties, and Joys; Angels
draw the Waters of their blissful Light, and Life from this Well. The Sounds,
Operations, Lives, Essences of Angels are only a Musick, Songs of Love, and
Joy to the beloved Soul, and her Bride-groom in their Union. In this sense
Christ, and a Saint in their Spiritual Glory, ride together upon the Cherubims.
The Angels are made as perfumed gales of Wind, on which they Flie; Flames
of a Divine Fire of Love, Joy, and Glory, which continually spring up, shine
before them, and round about them; penetrate thorow all things, converting
all things into the same Ministerial Brightnesses, and Harmonies of an Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Life, and Love under their Feet.</p>
               <p>But there is another passage worth our observation, before we leave the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to this Psalm: <hi>To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim. Shoshannim</hi> was an
Instrument of six strings, upon which the Tune to this Song was plaid. If
there be, as Divines say, <hi>Tot Mysteria quot Apices,</hi> so many Mysteries, as points of
words, letters, or Marks in the Holy Scripture, we may well believe this six-stringed
Instrument to allude to the Creation made up of the several Works of
six several Days. He that hath Eyes to see what the Spirit doth, and Ears to hear
the Sound of the Spirit, understands this great frame to be a well-tuned Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of so many strings, as there are Creatures in it; the whole Composure of
Providence from the beginning of the world to the end of it, this Song of
Loves plaid upon it by Jesus Christ to his Heavenly Bride, whose Spiritual sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
see the Harmonious, and Delicate Motions of his Hand upon every string,
and take in with unexpressible delight the ravishing Melody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shoshannim</hi> signifies also the six-leaved Lilly. <hi>Can.</hi> 2. 1. It is doubtful
whether the Holy Spirit speak in the Person of Christ, or the Church, when
he saith in his Song, <hi>I am the Rose of Sharon, and the Lilly of the Valleys.</hi> It
is generally understood of Christ. In that Mysterious History of <hi>Esther,</hi> as
<hi>Esther, Mordecai,</hi> the Jews, so the City <hi>Shushan,</hi> the City of the Lilly represent
the Church of Christ in general, or each holy Soul in particular. Interpreters
here apply the Lilly to the Bride, It is in the plural number Lillies, and the
clause may be rendred, concerning the Lillies. So the Subject of this Song of
Loves is signified to us, Jesus Christ, and his beloved Bride, two Lillies upon
the same Root, Flourishing with the same Beauties, smiling Reflections each of
other. Either of them with his six leaves comprehends in itself the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the whole Creation in their Original Purities, and Sweetnesses. Both
alike, in that Spiritual Image in which they are united, are to the variety of
Creatures, as the Seventh Day to the other six, a Bed of Rest, and Delights
with a Canopy of Glory; their Rest, Sanctification, and Blessedness.</p>
               <p>But it is time to pass from the <hi>Title</hi> to the <hi>Psalm</hi> itself. The first verse is a
Preparation to the matter contained in the Song. It consists of Three Parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:49838:109"/>
1. The Flame, and fulness of the Author; <hi>My heart enditeth a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
The word, <hi>Enditeth,</hi> is used only this once. Some expound it, boileth with
a good matter, and make it an allusion to Meat-offering in the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
prepared by fire in a Frying-pan. So the eternal Spirit, which is Love, hath
the place of the Holy Fire. The Heart is the Frying-pan. The Excellencies of
Jesus Christ in his own Person, and his Brides, with their mutual Affections,
and Joyes are the Meat-offering.</p>
               <p>Some interpret this Boiling by the bublings and wellings forth of a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
Thus the Chrystalline Waters of the Light, Life, and Beauties of Christ,
mingled with the Heavenly Fire of his Love, are the Sea. The Heart is the
Spring into which this Sea by Invisible Tracts, and hidden Passages conveyeth
its flowing Treasures, which from thence pour themselves forth into rich,
pleasant, and plentiful Streams.</p>
               <p>2. The Excellency of the Subject, <hi>I speak of the things, which I have
made touching the King.</hi> This King is called God, and seated upon the Throne
of Eternity, <hi>v.</hi> 6. which verse is cited, and applied to Jesus Christ, as he
comes the second time into the World, attended by all his holy Angels after
his Resurrection; and Ascent to the Throne of his Father. This is the King,
this is the Bridegroom, and the Beloved of the Soul; Jesus cloathed with the
Royal garment of his Divine Nature, crowned with the Glory of the Father,
perfumed with all the good ointments of the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>3. The Power, by which the Author is inspired in the composing of this Song
<hi>My Pen is the Tongue of a ready Writer.</hi> Holy men of God spake, as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. As the Son is the Wisdom, Power,
and Glory of the Father: So the Holy Ghost is the Love of the Father, and
Son, he is called by the name of Charity, or Love, 1 <hi>Cor. 13. v.</hi> 1. 8. He is
that Love, by which God and a Saint dwell one in another, as Love is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to be the Union between the Lover, and the beloved Object. So he is
spoken of. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4 16. God is Love; He that dwells in Love, dwells in
God, and God dwells in him. It is the Inspiration of this Holy Spirit of Love,
by which this Song of Loves was penned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Heart is enditing a good matter.</hi> My heart is full, boileth up, and floweth
forth with a good matter, sweet, beautiful and profitable, This Heart repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
every Member of Christ, which all have one, and the same Spirit. These
words thus opened, afford us this Doctrine.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Doct.</hi> A good Heart is a Treasury of good things. <hi>Matth. 12. 35. A
good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth good Things. A</hi>
Treasure, or Treasury implyeth two things:</p>
               <p>1st. <hi>A Place.</hi> A good Heart is a Treasury like Heaven in three respects;
1. It is great, and spatious. It comprehends all things within itself. It hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
above it, or without it, to shut it up, and confine it. 2. It is of a sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ing,
and glorious Substance, made of Light. 3. It is incorruptible, immo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:49838:110"/>
impregnable. No Thief can there break in to steal. No moth, or rust con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes:
There is no Principle of corruption, or decay within: No power from
without can prevail there.</p>
               <p>2. Precious things laid up in this Heavenly Heart make it a good Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury.
All the precious things of the Sun, and Moon, of the Heavens above,
and the deep below, are here. Here are <hi>Eden</hi> and <hi>Paradise.</hi> Gen. 2. 10. A
River went out of <hi>Eden</hi> to water the Garden. The Jews observe from this
place, that there are two <hi>Paradises,</hi> a Superiour, and Inferiour; One above,
Another below. In that above is the Fountain of Pleasure, from thence the
stream descends, which makes that below ever-green, and flourishing with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.
<hi>Eden</hi> signifies Pleasure or Delight, which name in another word is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Christ, as he was eternally in the bosom of the Father; <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30.
I was by him, one brought up with him, Delights from day to day. Jesus
Christ in his Heavenly Image, in the Substance and Essence of the eternal Light,
is <hi>Eden,</hi> the Paradise above. In his earthly Image, the sweet Shade where
all his Beauties seem at once to sleep and spring, he is the Paradise below.
There is he the <hi>Eden,</hi> and the Fountain in the midst of <hi>Eden.</hi> Here the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
watered by the River going forth from <hi>Eden.</hi> A good Heart hath in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
both these Paradises; the Fountain, and the Stream; <hi>Eden,</hi> and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
<hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 15. The Lord Jesus calls his Spouse, A Fountain of Gardens,
a Well of living Waters flowing from <hi>Libanon.</hi> The holy Heart is both the
Fountain which makes all things Gardens, Paradises, which way soever it
flows, and those Gardens too. It is both <hi>Libanon</hi> with the Fountain in it;
and the Gardens below in the vallies, in the midst of which the Living Waters
from this Fountain run along.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n.</hi> The Heart is that Spirit, which is the first Spring, and Principle
of Life in man. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. Keep thine heart with all Diligence: For out
of it are the Issues of Life. All the treasures of this World, its Light, Forms,
Vertues, operations are first in the Sun. From thence they flow forth in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Streams all round about him, while yet they are still comprehended in
him, as being not only their inmost Center, but also their outmost Circle of
Light, and Life. So is the Heart, or Spirit of Man, an Invisible Sun in the
midst of him, far more great or glorious than this which we see; in which all
forms, and acts of Life, like Beams, rise up first, and fullest; from whence
they are dispensed, and dispersed.</p>
               <p>The Hebrew word, to keep, imports a double sense. 1st. Diligently observe
thine Heart, what Spirit, or Principle it is, by which thou art acted. Such as
this is, such is thy whole Life. If thy Heart be a Substantial, true, pure
Spirit, thy whole way, and work, all thy Joyes are Substance, Truth, Light,
Immortality, as the Visions of God. If the Heart which is in thee, be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy,
thy Life is vain and empty, the dream of a shadow. Is thy heart cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
and polluted? then are all thy Streams poisoned, death lurks and sports
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49838:110"/>
itself in them with an innumerable company of Devils. 2. Keep, that is,
preserve thine own, thy true Heart with all diligence. Abide in Christ, and
his Love, as the only root of Life, from whence alone spring the sap, green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
flowers, fruits of true Sweetnesses, Beauty, and Blessedness. Watch
day and night, that no other Spirit put forth itself in thee; for every other
Principle besides Christ, and his Love, will certainly prove a Counterfeit, and
instead of a Heart, out of which the Issues of Life ought to be, a root of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness.</p>
               <p>There is a Twofold Heart:
<list>
                     <item>1. Natural.</item>
                     <item>2. Spiritual.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. There is a Natural Heart. This is the supream part of the natural Soul,
the Angelical Spirit in Man. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 23. St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayes: <hi>The very God of
Peace sanctifie you wholly: and I pray God your whole Spirit, and Soul, and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Here we
have the natural Man divided into three parts, which are equally capable of
being sanctified, or by defilement made subject to blame. 1. Spirit. 2. Soul.
3. Body. The Spirit is as the Fountain; the Soul the Stream of Life: The
Body the Channel in which this Stream runs along. The whole Man is one
Beam sprung immediately from the Divine Glory. The upper end of the Beam,
where it is fullest and brightest, immediately united to, and rooted in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Light, makes the Spirit. The lowest point, least and darkest, almost
vanishing into the Shade, with which it mingles its light, where it toucheth
the Earth, is the Body. The Soul is the middle of that Beam, partaking of
both these, dividing and uniting them, like the Firmament between the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
above and the Waters below; the Angels being the Waters above the
Firmament; and Corporeal Lives those below.</p>
               <p>The Spirit is the Angel in Man, or Man in the Similitude and Society of
Angels; the invisible Image, the first Treasury of all his Natural Beings, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Life, which afterward descends, and distinguisheth itself into the varieties
of Inferiour Acts, and Appearances. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore in the forementioned
place calls it their whole Spirit.</p>
               <p>The Body is the Outward and Visible Image, the Shadow below of this
above.</p>
               <p>The Soul is the Life, by which the Spirit descends into the Body, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
communion with it, and gathers it up again into itself.</p>
               <p>According to these Distinctions and Descriptions <hi>Solomon</hi> discourseth, <hi>Eccles.
12. 7. Then shall the Dust return to the Earth as it was: and the Spirit shall
return to God, who gave it.</hi> The name of God there signifies Gods or Angels,
for whom it is frequently, and expresly used in the Holy Scripture. The
Jews say it properly imports the Divine Nature, as it is cloathed with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical;
God in the midst of all his Holy Angels, coming forth into the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
descending to be the Head of it.</p>
               <p>It is an <hi>English</hi> Proverb: If men could live without the company of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49838:111"/>
men, they should converse with Angels. This is true; when the Spirit, which
is the Head, and the Man in us, withdraws itself from its Shadowy Image, the
Body, which is as the Woman, it finds itself in the Form of an Angel, and in
the Society of Angels. From the Angelical State and Company it descends
into the Body. Thither it returns again, when it leaves the Body.</p>
               <p>This is the Natural Heart, the Angelical Spirit in Man, made in the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of God, as he cloaths himself with the Angelical Image, as with a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Light, and so vailing his naked, unaccessible Glories comes forth to
be the Head of Angels. This Spirit is the Immediate Seat of the Divine
Presence, the Glory the Angelical Throne. Here the precious things of the
Sun, and the Moon, of the Invisible, and Visible Image of the Divine Nature;
here the Riches of the whole Creation appear together in their fullest Lustre,
and most beautiful Order. The Letters of the Latine Name for Heart, <hi>Cor,</hi>
make the first Letters of those word, <hi>Camera Omnipotentis Regis,</hi> which being
interpreted are, the Chamber of the Almighty King. It is a common obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that the Heart of Man is Triangular, which therefore cannot be filled
with the round World, but only with the Trinity. This Heart, of which
we speak, is properly Triangular, consisting like the Angels, of these Three,
Essence, Understanding, and Will, the proper, and Immediate Type of the
Trinity, which as it can be fitted, and filled up only with the Truth of that
Type, those Three ever-blessed Persons, as their Seal in the noblest mettal, next
themselves, it contains more expresly, more at large, and more gloriously all
those Figures, and Draughts of Divinity, which are imprinted upon the Face
of any Creature. O the inestimable Treasures of Mans Natural Heart, if
Sin change it not from a Palace of Angels to a Prison of Devils, or a Grave!</p>
               <p>2. There is a Spiritual Heart, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 6. 16. He that is joyned to the
Lord, is one Spirit. Mark the Absoluteness and Universality of the expression:
one Spirit. He who is joyned to the Lord Jesus by believing, is one Spirit
with Christ, one Spirit in Christ, one Spirit, as Christ is one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galat,</hi> 3. 19, 20. St. <hi>Paul</hi> thus distinguisheth between the Law, and
the Gospel: The Law was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator.
Now a Mediator is not a Mediator of one; but God is one. There is a Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Mediator; one, who hath his Ground in the Distance, and his End to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Distance between Two Parties. The other is founded in an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and his work is to manifest, and make perfect this Unity. The Character
of the Law is Duality, and Division. God, and the Creature are presented
each to other, as two upon different Principles, treating on a Covenant of works,
containing different Terms to be performed by each apart. In the Gospel God
reveals himself, as he is One, as he is the Ground, the Object, the End of all his
affections, and operations; as he comprehends himself, and the Creature in one
Person, and in one Spirit in our Lord Jesus; as he loves the Creature with the
same love, with which he loves himself, and beholds it in the same Glory, with
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49838:111"/>
which he beholds himself in Christ. This is the Covenant of Grace, in which
the Lover, and the Beloved are both One.</p>
               <p>You may now ask me two Questions:
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Q.</hi> 1. How God is One?</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Q.</hi> 2. How a Believer is one Spirit?</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. How is God One?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> God is one four wayes. 1. He is perfect. He comprehends all parts
of Excellency in every kind and degree, Essentially in one supream, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
Point of Being within himself. He is to himself the Eye, the Light,
and the Object; the Love, the Loveliness, the Joy and Fruit of both; all in
One. The most curious Composition of all Sweets in one Ointment, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume;
The most natural extraction of the vertues of all herbs and flowers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one Sweetness in Hony falls infinitely short of the Unity of all Perfections
here, and the Perfection of this Unity.</p>
               <p>2. God is Pure. There is no mixture in him. As they say of Gold the
purest Mettal; It is <hi>plenum sui,</hi> full of itself: so is God in the highest sense.
Every grain of pure Gold, is Gold. Every thing in God is God. There is no
mixture, Division, Allay, or Bound. The Divine Nature is endlesly compleat,
and entire within itself, like a Sea of unshaded Light, which hath no shore,
or Bottom. God is Light, and in him is no darkness. 2 <hi>John</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>3. God is unchangeable. He is the Rock unmoveable; He is the Rock of
ages. All successions of Time, like Waters of a River pass by him, and behold
him through all revolutions fixt in the same place, and State. He is the
Rock of Eternity. As Wheels turning round in a Cave within a great Rock:
So all the Times and Changes of this World are comprehended within the
Unchangeableness, and Eternity of his Essence.</p>
               <p>4. God is the Fountain. He is not a Broken, Barren, but a perfect, and
pregnant Unity. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 36. Of him, and Through him, and To Him are
all things, to whom be Glory for ever. As all numbers are a Unity multiplied,
so are all things various Sparklings of this Divine Unity; Emanations, and
Manifestations of the same God presenting himself to us at sundry times, and
in divers manners. Love is defined to be <hi>Partus in pulchro,</hi> a Birth in a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
This is the true nature of things, that Divine Love, which is the Birth of
all Varieties of, and in this Beautiful, this Blessed Unity.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Q.</hi> How is a Believer one Spirit?</p>
               <p>1. That One, Eternal Spirit brings forth the Spirit of a Saint, as his own
immediate, proper and Peculiar Birth; as the dear Reflection of himself. A
Saint is the Workmanship of Jesus Christ, not as a Picture is of a Painter,
but as a Child is of the Father, one Spirit, one Life, one Divine Nature is in
Both.</p>
               <p>2. This one Spirit begets, and brings forth the Spirit of a Saint in his own
likeness. <hi>Rom. 8. 29. God hath predestinated us to be conformed to the Image of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49838:112"/>
his Son;</hi> that is to his heavenly Image, as he is the quickning Spirit: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
15. 45, 49. The Lord Jesus is our Father, the Father of the new World,
the New Birth in us, as he is the Heavenly one, that Spirit, which is the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Unity, the Lord and Fountain of Life, and Spirits. So he brings us
forth in the Image of the same Heavenly Form, and of the same Divine Unity.
Thus he prays to his Father; <hi>John 17. 22. The Glory which thou gavest to
me, I have given to them, that they may be One, as we are One.</hi> Behold the
Divine Birth of a Saint, the Divine Likeness into which he is born, and the
Divine Unity, the Ground, and Form of the Divine Birth, and Likeness.</p>
               <p>3. The Eternal Spirit unites itself to the Spirit of a Believer thus regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in the most Intimate, Entire, and Inseparable manner. They mutually
inhabit, fully possess, perfectly enjoy each other. In life, and death, time, and
eternity they are undivided. Thus this Heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi> the Unity, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Spirits casts himself into the sleep of Humane Life, and of Death, that
he may bring forth from his Side, and his Bosom this Sister-Spirit, this true
<hi>Eve,</hi> the Mother of all Living, of all Heavenly, and Spiritual Lives, as he is
the Father. Then, when he awakens in the Resurrection from the Dead, he
takes her to be his Spouse, as she is his Sister in the Fellowship of the Divine
Unity, which is the glorious Ring, and Circle of all Relations. So she, who
is Spirit of his Spirit, in the likeness of the same Spirit, is made one Spirit
with him.</p>
               <p>Thus you have an Answer to these two Questions. You see, how God is
One; How he, that is joyned to the Lord, is one Spirit. O that men knew
God unvailed, revealed in the Light, and Grace of the Gospel, as he is One!
O that they they did rellish the Sweetness of this Unity of the Spirit, which is
the height of all Relations, by which God is one to a Believer in all times,
and things, one in him, one with him; by which he also is one to, in, and
with God! This sight and sense would make us to be continually in Pangs
of longings to be regenerated, and brought forth into this Spirit, and Unity;
as Jesus Christ is always in pangs of Love to bring it forth, and form it
in us.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this Reason; This Holy Spirit, this Spirit of Unity, and
Unity of the Spirit is the Spiritual heart, of which we speak. St. <hi>Paul Ephes.</hi> 3.
expresseth it by being rooted in Love. This is that Root, which we have
in the eternal Love of God, in that Love, which is God, in God, as he is Love.
This is the new Heart, which is bred and cherished in the bosom of the Father.
These Heavens above us comprehend in their Circuits all things here below,
which, as learned men teach us, are figures, &amp; images of their vertues sent forth
from them. But they have fixed in themselves innumerable Bodies of Light,
and Glory far exceeding all things here. They say, that these Heavens are
Circular, because that round Figure is most ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>acious, and beautiful, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Image of the Unity of Angelical <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> How great and glorious a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49838:112"/>
Circle then vastly transcending the Heaven of Heavens is this Divine Unity,
this Spirit which is the new heart of a Saint? All the Heavens, and this earth lie
within the compass of it, as Light shadows which it casteth from it self. But
as for those Treasures which are proper to it, which are fixt in it, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
more innumerable, how infinitely richer are they? The mind of Christ
with all the Beauties, and Brightnesses there; the deep things of God, with
all those Lights and Joys unfathomable to every natural Eye, and Heart, lie
within the Circuit of this Spiritual Principle. A great Philosopher call'd the
Angelical Spirit in man, which is his Natural Heart, the Flower of the Soul.
It is so indeed, as the Blossoms upon Fruit-Trees; but the Divine Spirit, the
Spiritual heart is the Fruit,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Use.</hi> Seek this good heart, which hath so good a Treasure in it. That
you may seek it with all affection, and diligence, take these Three directions:
Believe the Truth of this Principle: Consider the Preciousness of it: Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
your Propriety in it.</p>
               <p>1. Believe the Truth of this Principle. When the Apostles asked the
Christians in <hi>Samaria,</hi> whether they had received the Holy Ghost, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that they had not so much, as heard whether there were a Holy Ghost
or no. Is not this the temper of many amongst us, of most, of the sensitive,
and natural Spirit in us all? We do not so much as believe, that there is a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost; much less, that this Holy Ghost is poured out upon any Soul, as a
Heavenly Anointing from above; or dwells in any heart, as the Principle of a
supernatural, and eternal Life. He that comes to God, must believe, that
God is, and that he is a Rewarder of those that diligently seek him: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
6. Fix in thine heart with an unshaken faith, these two Radical Truths,
from which all the fatness, and sweetness of the Tree of Life is derived into
our Spirits: 1. That God is. 2. That there is a Union between God
and Man in One Spirit. Say frequently to thy self: It is true, It is the first
Truth, upon which all other Truths are built; that there is a supream, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
Being, which shines through all, and fills all, the Fountain,
and Measure; the End, Perfection, and Blessedness of all Beings. It is as
true, that this ever-glorious God descends in Jesus Christ to sow himself by his
own good Spirit as a Divine Seed in the heart of man below; that by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
of his original Excellencies he shines, as a spiritual Sun from above in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Soul, to quicken, awake, and call forth this Seed, in the vertue of which the
Soul springs into a new, and heavenly Being, comes to God by the fresh Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his life, grows up into his Likeness, pleaseth him, is possess'd, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd
by him, possesseth, and enjoyeth him with an unexpressible fulness of all
mutual, and Divine Pleasures. When the Merchant in the Gospel found a Pearl
in the Field, he went, and sold all to purchase this Field. If you have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
this rich Pearl of the Divine Nature, as a Root at the bottom of yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:49838:113"/>
self up to the conduct, activity, fruitfulness, enjoyment of this alone.</p>
               <p>2. Consider the preciousness of this Heavenly Principle, <hi>Es.</hi> 6. 13. God
compares his people in the greatest desolations to an Oak, whose Substance is
in it, when it hath cast its leaves: so saith he, the Holy Seed shall be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
thereof. Consider here three Precious Things in this good Heart, which
is the Seed, and Principle of Grace in us.</p>
               <p>1. This Spiritual Principle is a Substance. <hi>Solomon</hi> complains of all
things under the Sun; the Eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the Ear filled
with hearing. He brings this as an Argument, and effect of their vanity. All
things here are Shadows only, and so empty, unsatisfactory, endlesly raising
expectations, and desire, but never answering them. When this Spirit, which
is far above the Sun is received by thee, when this becomes the Principle of
all thy faculties, which sees in thine Eye, hears in thine Ear, understands, and
wills in thine heart; when this is the Treasury, from which all Objects come
forth to act those faculties: then thine Eye will be satisfied with seeing substantial
Beauties, thine Ear will be filled with substantial Melodies, thine Understanding
will sit down to a Heavenly Feast of substantial Lights, and Truths, thy Will
shall lie down to a Sweet and Eternal rest in a bed of substantial Embraces, and
Joys, in the midst of the Substance, and Essence of Goodness itself.</p>
               <p>2. This is the Holy Seed. The Heavens over our Heads are pure. They
are free from that gross, and dark Matter, with which all Forms of things are
mixt here on Earth. This Purity of theirs, is their Transparency, Light,
Lustre, Harmony, Vertue, Incorruptibility. Yet they are Corporeal, and
Bodily; their bright Beauties shall be turned into Darkness, and Blood. The
Angels are purer far, than these Heavens. They have no Cloud, Clog, or
Dross of Bodies. Yet are they mixtures of Light and Shade. Their Glories
are vails upon the true Glory. They wax old, as a Garment, and are changed.
Their Nature is subject to stains, and falls. But this Principle, which is the Seed,
and Heart of a Believer is purer than the Heavens, or the Angels. It is the
Spirit of God, the true Light, in which there is no Darkness; Simple, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible,
Unchangeable.</p>
               <p>3. This Principle is durable. It is a Fountain springing up in the Soul to
Eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 4. O precious Treasure! Eternity is defined to be the
full, and unbounded Possession of all Good at once, in One. Pearls have their
price, because they have their lustre in a lasting Substance. This Holy Seed
is the onely Pearl of price, both for its Lustre, and for its lastingness.</p>
               <p>The Will of Man naturally moves to good. The greater the good is, and
the more clearly it appears to us; so much the more natural, and powerful are
the motions of our Will to it. Did we understand the goodness of this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Principle for the Reality, the Excellency, the Eternity of it; the Waters
are not carried so naturally, so constantly to the Sea, nor Fire upwards to the
Bosom of Heaven; as our Souls would to this Sea of Life, and Bosom of Love,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49838:113"/>
Union with God in the Unity of his own Spirit. Thus we have done with
the 2d Direction to quicken us in our pursuit of a new Heart, a Spiritual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
which is to consider the preciousness of it.</p>
               <p>3. Understand your Propriety in this Divine Principle. 1. You were
made in the Similitude, and Image of God. He is your Original; the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and Truth of your Being; more truly your selves, than you are your
selves. 2. God is your Father, <hi>There is one God the Father, of whom are all
Things,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul 1 Cor.</hi> The Cheeks of Christ are said to be Beds of
Spices: <hi>Cant. 5. v.</hi> 13. Our Immortal Souls, our whole Persons are sprung
up out of the Glories of the eternal Spirit, as Spices, and Flowers out of their
Beds in the Gardens. When we are united to this Spirit, we return to our
own Original, like those flowers, we sink down into our proper Beds and Roots,
to receive a fresh Life and Beauty. 3. We are made by, and in Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.
By Christ, as our immediate Principle, and Pattern; In Christ, as our proper
Habitation. The Original Sin of Devils, which infected Mankind, is plainly
set down to be this: <hi>Jude</hi> 6. They kept not their first State, in <hi>Greek,</hi>
Principle: but left their own Habitation. Propriety begets Love; for both
Love and Propriety have their life and root in Unity. There is nothing which
is so much thine own, as God, as Christ, as the Spirit. These are thine own
Father; thine own Habitation, where thou art at home; thine own Principle;
thine own Original; thine own truest and best Self. Let this Propriety then by
Love ascending from thee, by the sense, and influence of a greater Love far
descending upon thee, encourage, allure, and attract thee to this Divine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
this Spirit of Union, by which thou becomest one Spirit with Christ, and
the Father. Thus return, O man, whosoever, whatsoever thou art, to
thine own Home, to thy proper Unity, as the wandring Bird to her nest; and
the Wife of Adulteries to the bosom of the Husband of her Youths, where
she finds a Fountain of Heavenly Loves still flowing fresh for her, as at the
first; into which she casts her self, and finds all the Beauties of her Youth, and
Purity restored unto her, as in the beginning; her sins and sorrows flying
away, and vanishing into the Air of this eternal Spirit, as Shadows of the
Night, and Dreams of a man asleep, when he waketh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Use</hi> 2. This good Treasure of a good Heart is a Cordial, and Comfort
against Losses, or Sufferings. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. The holy Penman tells the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to whom he writes, they took joyfully the spoiling of their Goods,
knowing in your selves, that ye have in Heaven a better and an enduring Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
Some read it knowing that you have in your selves in Heaven a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and an enduring Substance. This Scripture upon the riches of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Principle in a Believer groundeth five sweet and full Consolations.</p>
               <p>1.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou hast the Substance. A Lacedaemonian invited to hear one sing
like the Nightingale answered, To what purpose, when I can hear the
Nightingale itself. When thy sense mourns to thy Soul, and saith: They
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49838:114"/>
have taken away our Estates, our Friends, all the joys of Life. They will take
away our Lives also: let thy soul reply; why should we mourn for the Shadows,
when still we have the Substance?</p>
               <p>2. Thou hast all things better. Philosophy saith, that every plant below,
hath its Star in Heaven; each Star its Angel above; the Angels their Idea's, or
Original Essences, and Truths, in God, to which they are as Types only. Is thy
Flower withered? Thou hast it in a Star. Is thy Star darkned? For thy Star
thou hast an Angel. Are the good Angels, which ministred to thee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
from thee? They are present, and appear to thee in a better manner, in
the Form of God. Canst thou grieve for the loss of a Figure in Wax, when
thou hast the same Figure in a Gold-Seal, from which the Impression of that
Form was made upon the Wax?</p>
               <p>3. Thou hast all to endure for ever. The Scripture compares Spiritual,
and Heavenly Things to Spices, for their Sweetness, and Incorruptibleness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they partake much of the Sun. Spices are prefer'd before Flowers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have a more lasting Sweetness; and not only so, but they preserve
us both living, and dead from corruption. Therefore they are used for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servatives
from Infection, and for Embalmings. Thou seest thy Flesh, and all
the Glory of the Flesh round about thee wither, and fade away. Trouble not
thy self. In stead of these Flowers thou hast Spices. Thou hast all thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
things in an incorruptible Spirit, where they not only preserve their sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
ever fresh for thee, but thee also ever flourishing in the enjoyment of
them.</p>
               <p>4. Thou hast all in Heaven. A Believer is ever in Heaven, and hath Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in himself. For that Spirit, which is his Principle is the highest Heaven.
The Joys of the Gospel are compared often to a Feast, to a Wedding-Dinner
at the Marriage of a Kings Son. Now there go to make up a Feast, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
costly, and curious fare, but all things suitable, Stately, and rich Rooms,
Musick, Perfumes, excellent company, all the Furniture, and Entertainment
great, beautiful, and delighting. Thus thy Sufferings only change the Scene.
What thou hadst before on Earth; now thou hast in Heaven, in the glorious
Fellowship of all Angels, and Triumphant Spirits, with the Ointments of the
Holy Ghost, the Melodies, and Harmonies of Divine Love sounding thorow
all the Beauties of the Divine Nature, in the purest Light guilding all; Joys,
and Immortal Pleasures like Doves with Silver Wings, and Golden Feather
flying about every where, being nothing but the Spirit of all Grace, Joy, and
Glory in various forms.</p>
               <p>5. Thou hast all this Substance, this Heaven in thy self. A Believer hath
these Heavenly Things in himself by a threefold Union.</p>
               <p>1. By a Union of Love. As these Heavenly things are thy Beloved; so
thou art their Love. As thou beholdest all pleasantnesses in their faces: so thou
art their Garden of Pleasures, where all precious things, new and old, are
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:49838:114"/>
treasured up for thy Beloved. They are thy rest, and delight: their Desire is
towards thee. You are in the Unity of the Spirit, as One made Two, and
Two made One again.</p>
               <p>2. By a Union of Likeness. Those Heavenly things, and thy Spirit are
as Brother and Sister that suckt the breasts of the same Mother; as Twin-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
or Roses springing from the same Root of Love. They are to you, and
you to them, as clear and shining Glasses, in which you mutually see the Faces
each of other, and your selves as reflections of each others Beauties. Jesus
Christ in the <hi>Canticles</hi> often calls the Holy Soul his Sister-Spouse. He calls her,
<hi>Can.</hi> 1. 9. My Love. The word in Hebrew according to its Root is the
same with that, which signifies a Friend, who is described to be <hi>Alter Idem,</hi> the
same in another Person. It properly imports One made into Two by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
as <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> the other half on Ones self.</p>
               <p>3. By a Union of Substances. Bodies can never meet in One. No one
Body can ever be in two places at once; nor two bodies ever in one place. They
unite only by Touches, by their outsides, by Accidents, and Shadows. A Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Heart, and Heavenly Things unite, as Spirits, as the purest Spirits, where
the Unity is most perfect. These intimately, totally, essentially, formally pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate,
possess, fill, and actuate each other. You have a shadow of it in the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Lights; or in two clear, and bright Eyes, when they look full, and
stedfastly one upon another. So Christ prays, <hi>John</hi> 17. 21. That they all
may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they may be one in
us. Again, <hi>v.</hi> 23, I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in One. The Radical, and Original Unity is that of the Blessed Persons
in the Trinity; the most immediate Branches, and liveliest Copies of it are
those Two, of the Divine, and Humane Nature in Christ's Person; of the
Head and Members in his Mystical Body. But this shall suffice for our present
Doctrine, that a good Heart is a Treasury of good things.</p>

of the Spirit into itself, to transform itself into his Likeness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>St. Paul</hi> spends the first part of his discourses in drawing aside the Curtain,
and setting the Person of Christ in its entire form, naked glories, and native
sweetnesses in the Eyes of Believers. Then he leadeth, and presseth them to
the enjoyment first, next to the Imitation of this <hi>Jesus</hi> upon the ground of his
own Loveliness, Love, and Life.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> part of this <hi>Psalm</hi> is spent in like manner upon the Person, and
Praises of the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> This <hi>Verse</hi> hath <hi>Three Parts.</hi> 1. The Beauty of
Christ; <hi>Thou art fairer, than the Children of Men,</hi> 2. The Love, and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ; <hi>Grace is poured into thy lips.</hi> 3. The Seal of the God-Head,
of the Father, of his Blessedness, and Eternity upon the Person of <hi>Christ;
therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The <hi>first part</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> is the <hi>Beauty of Christ; Thou art fairer than
the Children of Men. Jesus Christ</hi> is the fairest of all men. He is fairer than
the whole generation of Mankind. He is fairer than any person born of Man.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> excells all Mankind in Beauty, in <hi>Three respects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Humane Nature</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> taken by itself, was born of a Virgin-Mother,
and God immediately supplying the place of a Father. So it was, as
a Morning-beam begotten between a pure Sun, and a clear sweet Air. Then
it was born without Sin, the proper, and only deformity of Spirits. Thus
his Soul and Body were like a Silver stream, flowing quietly in a clean channel,
where the Image of the Skie, and all the Heavenly Bodies figures itself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
and clearly. So did the Mind, Will, and Workings of the God-Head
figure themselves, and shine in the Manhood of <hi>Christ.</hi> Lastly it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense of Divines, that the Complexion of <hi>Christ</hi> was very delicate, and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:49838:115"/>
pure, arising from the most accurate proportion of the Elements, the most exact
Harmony, and purity of the Humours, and Spirits in his Body. We never
read, that he was at all Sick. As this made all his Sufferings the greater tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the quickness of his sence: so it made him in his outward Form extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sweet, and lovely above the rest of men.</p>
               <p>But besides all this, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> seems to fix its eye upon the Humane
Nature of <hi>Christ</hi> in two other States different from that of his <hi>Incarnation</hi> by
the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> as he is the <hi>First-born</hi> of the whole Creation, or of every
Creature; and as he is the <hi>First-born</hi> of those that rise from the Dead; <hi>Coloss.</hi>
1. 15, 18.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> say, that the <hi>Messias</hi> was the <hi>first Creature;</hi> that all the rest were
made <hi>by Him, in Him,</hi> and <hi>for Him,</hi> as Pictures to the Life, and Copies to the
Original. A German Divine teacheth, that he who receives the Body of Christ,
receives at once all, that is good, or fair in the whole world from the Beginning
to the End of it.</p>
               <p>But the Humanity of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> as he is the <hi>First-born</hi> of those that
are risen from the Dead, excels <hi>Adam</hi> in all his Innocency, and primitive Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
yea, and <hi>Himself</hi> also, as he was the <hi>First-born</hi> of every Creature, the
Natural Head of Angels, as much as Heaven exceeds the Earth, or a Paradise in
the third Heavens an Earthly One, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 15. 49. The <hi>former</hi> was an
<hi>Earthly</hi> Beauty, fading, designed for a Sacrifice, to be exposed to all sorts of
shame, and Sufferings, to be made a Prey to the devouring jaws of Death. This
<hi>latter</hi> Beauty is <hi>Heavenly,</hi> Incorruptible, seated upon a throne, which indureth
for ever, and ever.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Second Respect,</hi> in which <hi>Christ</hi> is fairer than the Children of men is,
the <hi>Union</hi> between the <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi> Nature. All the Beauties of our
Saviours Manhood are heightned by this Union to that Lustre, and Loveliness,
which cannot be express'd in any meer Creature; as a fine Cloud, a Garden of
Flowers, a Statue of Gold are quite other things, when the naked Sun sheds
his Beams immediately upon them, than when they are seen in a common, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
Light.</p>
               <p>By vertue of this <hi>Union</hi> the Humane Nature of <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>One Person</hi> with
the Divine. As precious stones are a common water congealed, but inclosing
particles of the Heavenly, Aetherial Light, and Spirit: So the Manhood of the
Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in its lowest state of Flesh, in its Blood, in the Grave, excel'd in
vertue, outshined in Lustre, Rubies, Diamonds, all the precious things of the
Creature in Heaven, and Earth, by vertue of this <hi>Union.</hi> For in all these States
God was the <hi>Person</hi> there; all subsisted in him, as Branches in the Tree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.
As <hi>Thomas</hi> did to the Wounds of <hi>Christ:</hi> So may we to our Beloved
in every form, in the Ghastliness of Death fall down ravished with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Glory, and cry out; <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> Every thing of our
<hi>Jesus</hi> seen into the depth, and inside of it, or in a right Light is an Heaven
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:49838:116"/>
of Heavens, <hi>John 1. 14. The word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us, and
we saw his glory, the glory, as of the Onely-begotten Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>The last, and highest consideration of</hi> our Saviours Beauty is, as he is <hi>God,</hi>
One with the Father, the Onely true God. This is the Head of fine Gold, of
solid Gold, to which all his other Beauties are, as the Locks, and Curles of his
Hair, blacks as a Raven, Shadows, and Foils. <hi>Can.</hi> 5. 11. This is your Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and this is your Friend, O believing Souls.</p>
               <p>I shall now give you a <hi>Proof</hi> from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> concerning the whole
Person of <hi>Christ</hi> after this explication of his Beauties in particular Forms, and
States.</p>
               <p>Man was made in the Image, and Similitude of God, of the whole Trinity.
For so Divines expound that, <hi>Gen. 1. Let us make man in our own Likeness,</hi>
of the <hi>Three</hi> ever-blessed <hi>Persons</hi> in the God-Head. Some make it a consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Deity in the Assembly of all the Holy Angels to make man an
Image, where all their various Excellencies should meet in the Unity of his
Person, to make Man a Musical Harmony, of which every Angel makes a part
only. Upon either of these Interpretations Man is the most beautiful of all
Creatures, having the perfections of all Summed, and Sealed up in himself, to
make a compleat similitude of the Divine Nature; like mystical Letters in the
<hi>Living Word,</hi> of which the <hi>First Adam</hi> is a Figure. In the 1. <hi>of Ezek.</hi> The
living Creatures full of Wings, and Eyes, by which the Angelical Nature is
represented among their other manifold Forms, which appear in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Angel, is the Form of a Man. This Humane Form is the Image of God, the
Beauty of the Angelical Essences, and the proper Essence of man.</p>
               <p>Let us then enlarge our Doctrine, and confirm it in its Latitude.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> be fairer than the Sons of Men, <hi>He is the fairest of all Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proof. C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n.</hi> 5. 9, 10. The Spiritual Bride, which is the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and each believing Soul in particular testifieth of <hi>Christ</hi> by the Spirit of
Truth, that <hi>He is white and ruddy, the chiefest of Ten Thousand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have here the Beauty of <hi>Christ</hi> set forth, <hi>first, Absolutely; then Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Absolutely; He is white and ruddy.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for <hi>white</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
smooth, clear, shining brightness, like that of the Body of Heaven in
the fairest, and calmest day. That for <hi>ruddy</hi> imports the purest, and most spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
red, like that of a Ruby. The same Word for the substance is set for
the richest Ruby, <hi>Lament,</hi> for the Ground out of which the First Man was
made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. which, say the <hi>Jews,</hi> was the fairest Composition of all the
finest parts of the Earth, with its most precious vertues far beyond the finest
Gold. The same word also is used for the First Man in his First Make, when
he was the fairest Flower in Paradise.</p>
               <p>The most perfect <hi>white</hi> is the purest Light, which hath no Darkness in it.
The purest red, is the most exact mixture of Light, and Shadow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:49838:116"/>
                  <hi>In General</hi> these words import a compleat beauty in the Person of <hi>Christ.</hi>
a beauty suitable to us, fitted to the Eye of our Faculties, our Sense, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
It is the manner of Men to express the most perfect beauty of
a Face by pure White, and Red. We have also a signification, that the choicest
beauties here are Shadows only of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> White, and Red in the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest
Face below is the <hi>Type,</hi> and <hi>Figure;</hi> in that glorious Person it is the <hi>Truth,</hi>
the <hi>Original.</hi> Divines call the Creatures with all their Excellencies <hi>Vestigia
Dei,</hi> the <hi>Foot-steps</hi> of God. If the Print of <hi>Christs</hi> Feet in the Dust make such
Beauties in Flesh and Blood, in these Heavens, in the Angels; what are the
Beauties of his own Divine Person?</p>
               <p>1. <hi>In Particular, 1. White</hi> is the Unity of Light in its simplicity. This
is the Person of <hi>Christ, Red</hi> expresseth the variety of Light and Darkness
with all their Degrees, and Mixtures, as they lie in the Unity of a pure, and
simple Light. This is Light in its several Forms, and Dresses. This is the
high, and Universal Harmony, which maketh all sorts of Musick, and Beauty
thorow all things in Heaven, and Earth, as it sendeth forth Sounds, and Glymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of itself any where. This hath all things in itself in their several perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
This maketh every thing in itself a Divine Musick, and Beauty to the
Spiritual Eye, and Spiritual Ear.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>White</hi> is the <hi>God-Head</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> making a Day of Beauty, whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h hath
no night going before it, or coming after it. <hi>Red</hi> is the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> as he is
<hi>God-man,</hi> where the Day, and the Night make one entire Day of perfect Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Night sweetly shadowing the Day, the Day shining beautifully thorow
the Night. Here Beauty hath all its Charms and Sweetnesses of its Mornings
and its Evenings.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>White</hi> is <hi>Christ in Glory. Red</hi> is <hi>this Christ, this Glory</hi> descending to the
Depth of all Sufferings. <hi>Red</hi> is the Colour of Blood. Nothing is more apt
among Natural things to delight, and ravish our Souls, than the Musick of an
excellent hand carried down in just degrees by soft, and melting strains to the
lowest, and there, as it were, quite silenced; then on a sudden carried up again
to a Sprightly, and Triumphant height. How agreeable, how delightful a Spect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle
is this to the Eye of the Spirit, to see the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> who is Glory itself
descending with beautiful Conformities to the Wisdom of the Father, with
sweet meltings of himself into the Will of the Father, thorow all degrees of
Sufferings into the Silence, and Darkness of Death itself; then in a moment to
spring up into Glory, and Immortality by the Resurrection from the Dead?
What believing, and loving Soul, when she seeth these beautiful goings of her
<hi>Jesus</hi> on the Earth, on Mount <hi>Golgotha,</hi> in the Grave, would not gladly go

of the Resurrection, as a Bridegroom out of his Chamber?</p>
               <p>I have hitherto spoken of the <hi>Absolute</hi> Praise of Christs Beauty in this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:49838:117"/>
                  <hi>He is White, and Ruddy.</hi> I am now to speak of the <hi>Comparative</hi> Praise;
<hi>He is the chiefest of ten thousand: Ten thousand</hi> is a particular number set for
All. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word signifieth the greatest number; it is applied to Angels,
<hi>Psal. 68. 18, The Chariot of the Lord is ten thousand;</hi> Angels are understood.
The Angels are the fairest of all creatures. Our Saviour is the fairest of all
the Angels. The word <hi>Chiefest</hi> is in Hebrew a <hi>Standard-bearer.</hi> The
<hi>Standard-bearer</hi> carries the <hi>Banner.</hi> The Banner is the Mark and Prize under
which all the Troop march, for which they fight, to which, and under which
the whole Troop is gathered together. The Beauty and Loveliness of <hi>Christ's
Person,</hi> is the <hi>Banner</hi> spread over all things, under which, in the force of which,
for which all things move in their several courses, to which the gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
of All shall be. The <hi>Instinct</hi> of this is <hi>All Love.</hi> The <hi>Possession</hi> and
<hi>Springing</hi> forth of this <hi>All Joy.</hi> We read in the <hi>Acts</hi> of an Altar with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
<hi>To the unknown God.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> preaching upon this <hi>Text,</hi> telleth the
<hi>Athenians; Him, whom ye ignorantly worship, preach I unto you;</hi> meaning
<hi>Christ.</hi> In the whole frame of Nature every Heart, every Creature, every Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
every Action is an Altar with the same kind of Inscription; <hi>To the
Unknown Beauty; To the Unknown Jesus.</hi> This is the Mark, the White, which
every Being in nature ignorantly moveth to, which every motion ignorantly
aimeth at; this is that which all Understandings, all Loves ignorantly worship,
esteem and adore; this Beauty of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> concerning which we now
speak. Blessed are your hearts, O Believers, which are Spiritual Altars with
the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> engraven upon them by the finger of God, flaming with
the fire of an heavenly Love, and bearing this Inscription; To the known
Beauty of that Jesus, whom we know, whose Person our Eyes have seen, our Ears
have heard, our Hands have handled, the Arms of our Spirits have embraced.</p>
               <p>I come now from the <hi>Proof,</hi> to the <hi>Reasons</hi> of the Doctrine, which are <hi>four.</hi>
               </p>

                  <item>1. Iesus Christ is Beauty in its Original.</item>
                  <item>2. He is the Perfection of Beauty.</item>
                  <item>3. He hath all the Parts of Beauty most compleat in his Person.</item>
                  <item>4. All Beauty is derived from him.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas. 1. The Person of Christ is Beautiful in its Original.</hi> He is the <hi>First,</hi> so
the <hi>Highest,</hi> and <hi>Best Beauty, Heb. 1. 3. Christ</hi> is said to be <hi>The Brightness of the
Glory of God. Four</hi> things go to make up the Glory of God: 1. <hi>Excellency;
2. Excellency at the height;</hi> 3. An <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>all Excellencies</hi> reflecting upon,
imparting themselves to each other. All center themselves in the bosom of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one. All see themselves living and shining in the face each of other, as in
a living Looking-glass. Our Beloved is that <hi>Image,</hi> into which this <hi>Glory</hi> so
brings forth it self, that it is <hi>One</hi> with it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brightness</hi> implies three things; 1. <hi>Glory</hi> at the <hi>Height,</hi> as Light in the
Sunshine; 2. <hi>Glory appearing,</hi> Glory in an Image; 3. <hi>Glory</hi> in its <hi>Purity.</hi>
The <hi>Person</hi> of our <hi>Jesus</hi> is such an <hi>Image,</hi> as is the <hi>Glory</hi> itself, a <hi>Deep</hi> of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:49838:117"/>
a pure, unmixt, unconfined, infinite <hi>Glory.</hi> He is an Image of so clear Glory,
so One with the Glory, that All the God-Head appears in Him, and nothing
of it can hide itself from being seen there.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Essential</hi> and <hi>Eternal Glory</hi> of the God-Head in
its own proper Form, in which it may be seen by Spiritual Eyes, in which it
may be a heavenly Bridegroom capable of being possessed, embraced, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
by the Spiritual Bride, the Wife of this Lamb, without spot or blemish.</p>
               <p>Can any soul that hath had the least glympse of this <hi>Mine,</hi> this <hi>Mass</hi> of
Glory, the Blessed <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> be so treacherous, like <hi>Judas,</hi> as to value
him at, and sell him for thirty pieces of silver, the Riches of this world? Can
any Spirit, upon whose inward Eye the least Beam of his Beauty hath faln,
be so prophane, as <hi>Esau</hi> was, to sell his Birthright, his Inheritance in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Beauty, the Glorious Person of his God and Saviour, for a Mess of
Pottage, for sensual satisfactions, for a lust, for a shadowy life on Earth?</p>
               <p>It is added, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. That He is <hi>the express Image of His,</hi> (namely, God
the Father's) <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Person. True Beauty</hi> is defined to be the proper and
native Image of some <hi>True Good.</hi> The <hi>True Beauty</hi> calls, and allures all hearts
to it. The <hi>True Good</hi> gives them rest in the bosom of that Beauty. <hi>Beauty is
Goodness visible: Good</hi> is the <hi>Invisible Spring</hi> and <hi>Center</hi> in that <hi>Beauty. God</hi> is
the <hi>First and Supreme Good; Jesus Christ</hi> then, who is the <hi>Express Image of
His Substance</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> in whom He is figured after the most exact and
lively manner, is the <hi>First and Supreme Beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God the Father is the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Supreme Good,</hi> as the <hi>God-Head</hi> in the <hi>Root.
Jesus Christ</hi> is the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Supreme Beauty,</hi> as the <hi>God-Head</hi> in the <hi>Flower,</hi>
springing out of, and standing in the Bosom of its <hi>Root,</hi> having all the virtues
of the <hi>Root</hi> in clear and full figures forming themselves most gloriously, and
most amiably upon it. The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is the <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>Supreme Love</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi>
as the <hi>God-Head in the Fruit,</hi> in which all the precious virtues of the <hi>Root,</hi> all

Sion <hi>the Perfection of Beauty God shall shine.</hi> There are <hi>three Things,</hi> which I
would make clear to you in this Scripture. 1. That <hi>Sion</hi> is the <hi>Third Person</hi> in
the Trinity, the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> 2. That the <hi>Perfection of Beauty</hi> is a description
of the <hi>Second Person</hi> the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> 3. Why these <hi>two</hi> are so joyned, as if one
only were meant. This <hi>verse</hi> hath a deep Mystery of Divinity in it. Glorious
Persons are contained here. But there is a Vail of borrowed Names from inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
things upon them. It will be worth your time, and patience to stay a

above is free, which is the Mother of us all,</hi> Gal. 4. 28, 29. <hi>We Brethren
are the Children of the Promise, as</hi> Isaac. <hi>As therefore it was then, so it is now,
he that is born after the Flesh, persecuteth him that is born after the Spirit.</hi> In
the <hi>First</hi> of these <hi>verses, Jerusalem above</hi> is said to be the <hi>Mother of us all.</hi> In
the <hi>Second</hi> these, <hi>All us,</hi> are expounded to be the <hi>Children of Promise.</hi> In the
<hi>Third verse</hi> the same persons are described by being <hi>born after the Spirit.</hi> This
Phrase of being <hi>born after the Spirit</hi> is fully explained by that of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
from whence it seemeth to be taken, <hi>John 3. That which is born of the Flesh,
is Flesh: That which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi> To be born <hi>after the Spirit,</hi>
and <hi>of the Spirit</hi> signifie both the same thing. Is it not then evident, that the
<hi>Jerusalem above, which is free, which is the mother of all the Spiritual Seed,</hi> is
the Eternal <hi>Spirit,</hi> after which a Saint is born, that is, <hi>of this Spirit,</hi> and in the
Image of this Spirit, where there is Liberty, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Now lay the <hi>Third</hi> Scripture by these <hi>two, Heb. 12. 22. We are come to
Mount Sion, the Heavenly Hierusalem, the City of the living God, to the Millions
of Angels, the general Assembly, to the Church of the First-born written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
to the Spirits of just men made perfect, to God, to Jesus Christ.</hi> Before, we
Saw <hi>Hierusalem above, and the Spirit,</hi> now we see <hi>Mount Sion, and the Heavenly
Hierusalem</hi> to be the same. Is it not then an infallible demonstration, that <hi>Sion</hi>
and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> are One, as the <hi>Type,</hi> and the <hi>Truth?</hi> Can any other be the
living City of the living God, where all the Holy Angels the First-born of
the Father, the Spirits of all Saints, as well on Earth, as in Heaven, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
in his Mediatory Kingdom, the Father upon the Throne of Judicature meet,
and appear together in the full liberty of Eternal Light, Love, and Joy; besides
the Unity of the Spirit, which is the Sweet and Sacred band between the two
Glorious Persons in the Trinity, between all pure, Spiritual, Divine Beings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
and below? This is the <hi>Spring,</hi> and Immortal <hi>Seat</hi> of them all.</p>
               <p>2. We have in this place another <hi>Person</hi> set forth by this bright, and lovely
Character, <hi>the Perfection of Beauty.</hi> We may discover our own Beloved, and
Bridegroom the Lord Jesus under this Title, if we bring to it the Lights of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49838:118"/>
two other <hi>Scriptures</hi> shining like this by his Appearance in them. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.
3. He is stiled <hi>the Brightness of Glory.</hi> Is not this the same, as to say; <hi>The
Perfection of Beauty?</hi> 2 Corin. 4. 6. <hi>God hath shined in our hearts unto the
Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face, or Person of Jesus Christ</hi>
Can Face answer Face in a Glass more exactly than these <hi>Two Scriptures</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
one another? In both you have <hi>God, God shining:</hi> in one you have <hi>God
shining from the Perfection of Beauty:</hi> in the other <hi>God shining with a Light of
Glory in the Face, or Person of Christ.</hi> God in all the Creatures, whether they
be Visible, or Invisible casts forth <hi>Shadows</hi> only of Himself. Then he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the <hi>Perfection of Beauty;</hi> when he appeareth in the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> as
Light in the Body of the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. But why are these <hi>two</hi> so joyned, as if they were the same Thing, <hi>from
Sion the perfection of Beauty?</hi> I will not examine, whether we may not disjoyn
them in reading, by putting in between them, <hi>and,</hi> or <hi>in,</hi> Particles frequently
understood; from <hi>Sion, and,</hi> or <hi>in</hi> the Perfection of Beauty God shineth.
This needeth not. There is plainly a difference between the <hi>English,</hi> and the
<hi>Hebrew.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> runneth word for word thus: <hi>From Sion, from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Beauty God hath shined.</hi> So you have the <hi>Three Persons</hi> of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed
<hi>Trinity</hi> clearly distinguished, and united in this shining of the God-Head.
The <hi>Father</hi> shineth, from the <hi>Spirit</hi> his holy hill of <hi>Sion,</hi> from the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ</hi> the Perfection of Beauty. These <hi>Two Persons</hi> are placed here,
as One in Another, a Globe of Light in a Globe of Light, and the Father
shining from them both to awaken in us this great, and glorious Truth, that
the Persons of the Sacred Trinity have their Perfection in each other, and
are ever undivided, when they appear nakedly in their proper Forms. The
whole Trinity is the Crown of Beauty upon every one of them.</p>
               <p>In particular <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> never appears, as the <hi>Perfection of Beauty,</hi> but
when he, and the Spirit appear both in One, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. from the 14th to the
end you read of a vail upon the Face of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Person of Christ in the
Type; then of a vail upon the Hearts of the Jews. These are both the same
vail. For the vail is never upon the Person of Christ properly, and simply, but
upon the Eye of our Spirits; as the Cloud is never upon the Body of the Sun,
but upon our Corporeal Eyes. For, as that doth in the midst of its world; so
doth the Person of <hi>Christ</hi> in the midst of all things ever comprehend, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
himself, and all things, in the simple and pure Light of his own naked
Beauties. But then in the same place we read, that the <hi>Vail is taken away in
Christ;</hi> and <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty;</hi> that is, freedom
from the Vail; Christ is seen unvailed in his naked Glories. It is added; <hi>Now the
Lord is that Spirit.</hi> Then mention is made in the last verse; of <hi>beholding the
Glory of the Lord with open Face;</hi> that is, Eye to Eye, the naked Eye of our
Souls to the naked Eye of his Beauties; every Spirit being all Eye. The
<hi>verse</hi> is closed thus; <hi>as by the Spirit of the Lord;</hi> or more agreeably to the <hi>Greek,
as of the Lord the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:49838:119"/>
I have alledged all this to make it plain to you, and to seal it upon your
understandings, and memories, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is then only seen in his <hi>true
Person</hi> and shape, without a vail, when he is seen in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> when Christ
and the Spirit are seen, <hi>as two distinct Persons in One. Sion,</hi> the <hi>Type</hi> of the
<hi>Spirit</hi> signifieth <hi>Vision. Hierusalem</hi> the Figure of the same <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Hierusalem</hi> is by interpretation the <hi>Heavenly Vision of Heavenly Perfection
and Peace.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is the <hi>Perfection of Beauty,</hi> the Heavenly Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of all things, the Peace of all Hearts, and Desires. The <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is the Heavenly Vision</hi> of this <hi>Heavenly Perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the way observe, that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> speaks in this 50 <hi>Psal.</hi> of the
Day of Judgement the Second, and last Coming, and Appearance of our Lord
and Saviour, after which he shall go away, and disappear no more. See here,
what manner of Appearance this is; in what State, in what Form the King
of Glory comes to the Marriage of his Bride, and to reign upon the Earth.
He comes in a Spiritual, and Divine Form, in the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> The
<hi>Eternal Spirit</hi> is an anointing of Beauty upon the whole Person of our Beloved.
He again is a Sun of Beauty looking forth in the Person of <hi>Spirit.</hi> Nay, the
Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> cometh in the Glory of all the <hi>Three Persons;</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> shineth
in the Person of the <hi>Son;</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> shineth in the Person of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> all <hi>Three</hi>
in <hi>One</hi> shine together in the glorified <hi>Humanity</hi> of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> all three
glorifie that with themselves; Inhabiting, and shining forth round about
with a full Light of glory in it, Figuring themselves in their Divinest Forms
upon it; overshadowing it, and cloathing it with the Brightnesses of their
own most entire, and most naked Appearances.</p>
               <p>Thus is <hi>Jesus</hi> the <hi>Perfection of Beauty.</hi> The Glory of the God-Head is
now consummate in Him, when all the <hi>Three Persons</hi> appear quite unvailed in
his <hi>Person.</hi> You who love and wait for this Appearance of your Heavenly
Bridegroom; who see this day, which his Spiritual Beauties make, and rejoyce
to see it with a Joy unspeakable, and glorious; you, who live in the sweet
dawnings of this day upon you; you, who have any thing of the Spirit of
the Bride in you; cry continually; <hi>Even so, so come quickly Lord Jesus in this
Thrice-Beautiful, and Thrice-Blessed Appearance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Person of Christ is the Perfection of Beauty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Perfection <hi>implyeth</hi> 3 Things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Clearness.</item>
                  <item>2. Compleatness</item>
                  <item>3. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensiveness.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. <hi>Clearness.</hi> That which is perfect, is pure, hath no spot, or mixture of
any thing Forreign. As every drop of Milk is Milk; so every thing, the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
Point in the Person of <hi>Christ</hi> is Beauty. He is Beauty itself in the <hi>abstract,</hi>
in its simple Essence. This Finite world cannot satisfie our desires, because they
are infinite. Behold here the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> a world of Beauty, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
to terminate, and satiate your infinite desires. For every thing is bounded
by another, or by its Contrary; nothing by itself; as Light by Darkness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Life
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:49838:119"/>
by Death. Our Lord Jesus is a Light of Beauty, where there is no Darkness,
and so no bound to set a stop to it from multiplying itself endlesly within itself,
meeting no where in its utmost Circles of glory with any thing besides itself.
It is this Beauty, which is sown in every Spirit, shooting up, and budding in
desires, flowring in delights. Love is this Beauty in the Seed, desires the sprou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of this Love. Therefore are our Loves, and Desires infinite, because this
<hi>Jesus,</hi> the <hi>Beauty,</hi> which is their <hi>Root,</hi> and their <hi>Fruit,</hi> is so.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Compleatness.</hi> The Beauty of <hi>Christ</hi> is perfect; nothing can be added to
it, <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Eccles. 1. 7. All rivers run into the Sea, and the Sea is not at
all the fuller.</hi> It is the Person of <hi>Christs,</hi> which is this Mystical Sea of all Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Sweetness, all the rivers of created Beauty, and Sweetness go forth from
him, and take away nothing. They all return into him again, and add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
When <hi>Lot</hi> had been made to drink Wine freely by his Daughters, he
perceived not when they lay down, nor when they rose up. Believing beloved
Souls, drink in the Lovelinesses of your own Heavenly Husband, drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
of them; so will ye have little, or no sense of the presence of the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of any Object, or Relation among the Creatures, when ye lye down in
its embraces; or of its absence, when ye rise up from it never to return to the
enjoyment, or sight of it any more. Your <hi>Jesus</hi> in his single Person is all Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
compleat in itself. He is the same; that which all Creature are; that
which they are not; with them, and without them. Their presence, and
their absence are the same, equally full of the same Beauty, and Sweetness in him.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Comprehensiveness.</hi> The Perfection of Beauty comprehendeth all Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Beautiful Things in itself. It is the <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>Essential Beauty,</hi> which
by its presence beautifies every thing. The Beauties of Angels, Stars, and
Flowers; of Bodies, and Spirits, all flourish together eminently, and unfading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is the Paradise of God, and the Bed of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
there.</p>
               <p>Thou, who mournest, and loathest thy self for some Deformity, or Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Spirit; who bemoanest thy self for some defect, comfort thy self
concerning this in the Person of <hi>Christ.</hi> God is said in one place; to call all
the Stars by name, and no one of them is wanting. The Person of thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
hath all Spiritual, and Natural Beauties in itself. Here thou mayst call by
Name the proper Beauties of thy Person, to cloath all thy shame with Glory,
to supply all thy wants with suitable Grace. Thou shalt find no one wanting.
Every one will answer readily; here am I; behold I bear thine Image, and
the Inscription of thy Name upon me. I have been laid up from Eternity in
the Perfection of Beauty, and kept for thee, unto this Season.</p>
               <p>You that complain for the want of any Loveliness, come to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
that you may have it, and have it in abundance, richly to enjoy. He is that
well of Beauty springing up to eternal Life, that is, with All, with Infinite,
with Endless Beauties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:49838:120"/>
You, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> your hearts captivated by any thing lovely on Earth, come
hither. Where the Person of <hi>Christ</hi> is seen, as he appears in the Spirit, unvail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
there is Liberty; the fulness of a Divine Beauty, the freedom of a Divine
Love taking off from our hearts the Chains of every ensnaring, and enslaving
passion. Behold that which thou lovest, in <hi>Christ</hi> the perfection of Loveliness,
where it is truest, and sweetest; so love it in him. Behold <hi>Christ</hi> beautifying by
his presence every beautiful Object, like the Sun-shine on Flowers; so love
him in it.</p>
               <p>One said; if a man know not the way to the Sea, let him follow the course
of a River. Every stream of Sweetness flows from our Saviour, and runs into
him, Let thy heart accompany it in this course, so shall it be led by a pleasant
Guide to <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> The nearer thou followest it to <hi>Christs Person,</hi> the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and fuller will the Sweetness be, as a River near the Ocean; till it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in him.</p>
               <p>When thy heart breaketh over any departing Beauty, or dying Sweetness
in a Friend, Child, Wife or Life, then think upon the <hi>Comprehensiveness</hi> of
<hi>Christs</hi> Beauty, which holds all other Beauties in it, as Heaven doth the Angels.
<hi>Solomon</hi> saith in <hi>Ecclesiastes, When man dieth, the body goeth to the Dust, from
whence it came; the Spirit to God, who gave it.</hi> Each thing returns to its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
to the Element from whence it is taken, and of which it is ever a part.
Darkness sinks down into the Pit of Darkness: the Spirit, which is the Light,
Life, Sweetness every where, every Spark, and Image of Divinity re-ascends,
and retreats into the Bosom of the first Image of God, which is <hi>Christ.</hi> Each
pleasantness, each beam of loveliness, is a glance, and sparkle of this Eternal
Image of Essential Beauty, which enfoldeth all things, and mingleth itself with
all things. That which thou callest the fading of any Sweetness dear unto thee,
is only the hasting of the loving stream to its beloved Sea; the disappearing of
the bright flame of Life into the glorious Brightness of its unseen Element.
Thou sayst; it is now dying, now dead, when it is emptying itself into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
of Beauties; retreating into the pure, and incorruptible Element of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Blessed Person of <hi>Christ.</hi> Cleave to it in this view of it, cast thy self
with it into these secret, and sacred depths of Life, and Loveliness; so shalt
thou never lose it, or thy self, save by being both together swallowed up into
the perfection of Beauty, the Eternal Treasury of all Beauties, <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now finished the <hi>Two first Reasons</hi> of the <hi>Fairness</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> above all
things; the <hi>Original,</hi> the <hi>Perfection</hi> of Beauty in his Person. Before I pass to
the other <hi>Two Reasons,</hi> let us look down a little upon our selves, and make
some application of these Beauties, which we have seen in the <hi>Person</hi> of our
Lord, to our own <hi>Persons,</hi> to enlighten the Darknesses, and redress the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Use. 1. A Caution.</hi> Let us take heed, that we make no inference, take no
encouragement from the Loveliness of <hi>Christ</hi> to make our selves unlovely in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:49838:120"/>
his Eye, to defile his Spouse in our selves, to stain his Glory by Sensuality, Lust,
or any presumptuous Sin. Our Saviour now dying saith to his Father of his
Disciples: <hi>I sanctify my self, that they also may be sanctified,</hi> John 17. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ</hi> put off in Death every thing of Earth, and Flesh. He lifteth himself
up by his Cross into Glory; that he may present himself again to the Eye of
our Spirits in the Spiritual, and Heavenly Brightness of the Divine Form, and
Glory; that he may baptize us into the same Sea of his Blood, and into the
same white Cloud of his own Spiritual Beauties; that we also by him may die to
the Flesh, and live with him in the Spirit. Hath Jesus Christ to this end made
himself <hi>higher than the Heavens, Heb.</hi> that our Hearts, and Live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> should be
low and vile, as the Earth? Is he ascended above all the Angels, all the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,
and Powers of Light, that we should become like Beasts, and yield
up our Bodies, and Spirits Instruments to the Principalities and Powers of the
Darkness of this World, and of Hell?</p>
               <p>Is there any hope of renewing such a Person by words, who thus turneth
the rightest, and pleasantest words of the Lord Jesus, and his Beauties unto
nourishment to vain, and filthy Lusts, to Corruption? Is any more to be done,
but to leave him to that Dreadful, and Delightful <hi>Maran Atha;</hi> which is by
interpretation, <hi>The Lord cometh;</hi> to the Person of Christ himself in his own
immediate Appearances, when those glorious and unexpressible Beauties of the
Spirit, and God-Head, in which he shall appear, shall be Flames of Fire burning
upon, and consuming every Earthly, Fleshly Principle, or Spirit in every Form.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Use. 2. A Conviction</hi> of the Evil of Sin, which blindeth us to the sight of
this Beautiful, and Blessed Person of our Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> How should we all curse
to the Pit of Hell, from whence it arose, that Charm, or Enchantment, if any
had such force to change the Sun into Sack-cloath, or hinder it from shining
any more upon the Earth? How much worse than a Grave would it make the
whole world, when we should have eyes open, and no Light? Far greater is
that mischief, which the Devil worketh by Sin. By the charm of this world,
which he raiseth, as an Apparition, and Lying Image from Hell, together with
the Lusts, which he awakeneth by it, he taketh away from us the glorious
Light of <hi>Christs Person</hi> ten thousand times brighter, sweeter, and of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
to us, than the Sun in Heaven, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi> 4. 4. By this means all our
faculties are, as so many Eyes continually awakened, continually benighted
with the blackness of Darkness, deluded with empty Shadows, and disappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the beloved Substance. So are our Spirits wandring in an everlasting
Darkness, tormented night and day with the fire of their own restless, eager,
and unsatisfied desires; while <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> their only Light, and Food is hid
from them under the Cloud of their Corruptions.</p>
               <p>Take heed especially of <hi>three Sins,</hi> 3 of <hi>Covetousness; Uncleanness; Enmity.</hi>
1. Take heed of <hi>Covetousness, Mat.</hi> 6. 22. Our Saviour warneth his
Disciples to take heed, what they made their <hi>Treasure,</hi> because where the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49838:121"/>
sure is, there the Heart will be. <hi>v.</hi> 21. The beloved Object irresistibly draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Heart to itself, and transformeth it into itself, as Seed doth the ground
in which it is sown. <hi>The Eye,</hi> saith <hi>Christ, is the Light of the Body. If thine
Eye be single, thy whole Body shall be full of Light, But if thine Eye be evil, thy
whole Body shall be full of Darkness; and if the Light, which is in thee be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
how great is that Darkness?</hi> The whole Soul, and every Spirit is an Eye.
The understanding is an Eye of Light; the Will is an Eye of Love. The
same word for the substance of it in the Hebrew signifies an <hi>Eye,</hi> and a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
The <hi>Object</hi> is the Light of this Eye, which sheds abroad in it the Beams
of its Light, Sweetness, and Influence. These are the waters springing up in
this Fountain.</p>
               <p>The <hi>single Eye</hi> in the Language of the Scripture is the <hi>good, the liberal, large,
open Eye.</hi> The Eye is single from its Object, when it hath fixed unchangeably
in it that single Object, which is truly and eternally One; when it looketh
upon all things only as they are comprehended in this Unity. This is such a
singleness, such a simplicity, that the Eye, and the Object are both One; the
Supream, and Eternal Unity is both the Eye and the Object in this Spirit; and
so the Fountain, which goeth forth from its own <hi>Eden,</hi> maketh the Soul a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
and watereth the whole Body.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Evil Eye</hi> is a <hi>contracted, divided, narrow, covetous, envious, malicious Eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beware O man, that the things of this world, that this world be not in thine
Eye. As <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is the Image of the Invisible God: so is <hi>this World</hi> the
Image of its God, the Devil, the Prince of Darkness, by which he becomes
visible to thee, enamou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Heart, with all his Hells, and Fires hid within this Cloud. And now a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Darkness big with a dreadful Tempest of Wrath dwelleth within thee,
and covereth all things round about thee.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> be the Object of thy Love, he will be as a Divine Sun
in the Center, and midst of thy Spirit, powring forth a great plenty of rich,
and glorious Beams thorow all parts, every point of thy Soul, thy Body, every
thing round about thee. Now all things shall be to thee one entire, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Body of Divine Light.</p>
               <p>Indeed the world compared with the great, and glorious world of Light,
and Beauty in the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> is as a Mote in the Sun. But if this Mote
be in thine Eye, it will deprive thee of the sight of this Sun.</p>
               <p>2. Take heed of <hi>Uncleanness.</hi> St. <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 23. teacheth us to <hi>hate the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
spotted with the Flesh.</hi> The Holy Spirit seemeth here to represent a Saint
after this manner; <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the inward, and Spiritual Man, as a Sun shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

forth from this Sun, thorow which the Sun itself is seen in every point of it.
As often as any unclean thought, or fleshly Imagination ariseth in us, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a spot upon our Garment. Now the White is turned into Blackness of

                  <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.
All vision dependeth upon the suitableness between the Eye, and the Object.
All sense in every kind of things proceedeth from the suitableness between each
Faculty and its proper Object. Suitableness is the visible Image, and effect of
an hidden Unity, and awakeneth that, as the Sun doth its own Seminal vertues
in the Earth, which spring up into all manner of Plants, Flowers, and Fruits.</p>
               <p>The pure Beauties of <hi>Christs Person</hi> are seen only by a pure Eye, which
Eye is the living Image of the same Person in the Unity of the same Spirit,
and awakened in us by the Appearances of that Glory. There is a <hi>Three-fold
Purity; Moral; Legal; Evangelical.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we would see the Image of God in the visible Frame of Nature, which
is the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in its <hi>Shadow;</hi> we must be baptized into the <hi>Blood,</hi> that
is, into the <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of this Image; we must be washed in this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
from all the gross disorders, and pollutions of the Flesh unto a <hi>Moral Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
If we would see the Divine Image shining in the midst of the Intellectual,
Angelical, Invisible things of Nature, which is the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> in its
<hi>Picture;</hi> let us baptize our selves into the <hi>Blood,</hi> that is into the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
of this Image. Let us in this Spring wash off, by the Fire upon the Altar
offer up all sensitive Forms, which is the Sacrifice of Beasts, that our Spirits may
be like the vail of the Tabernacle having <hi>Cherubims,</hi> the Forms of Invisible,
and Heavenly things only formed upon them. This is our <hi>legal Purity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But would we see that Image of the invisible God, which is itself invisible
to every Natural Eye, of Men, and Angels? Would we see, not the <hi>Shadow,</hi>
the <hi>Picture,</hi> but the <hi>Brightness of Glory;</hi> the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Life</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed?
We must then be baptized into the <hi>Blood,</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the
Principle of this Eternal, Essential Image of God. This alone <hi>can purify the
Heavenly Things themselves, Heb.</hi> This alone can wash out the impression and
similitude of every Creature in its Natural State, that the uncreated Glory,
which alone is the <hi>true Heaven,</hi> and lies hid under the other, as a Diamond
in a heap of rubbish may shine forth. This is our <hi>Evangelical Purity,</hi> and our
<hi>Evangelical Vision</hi> of God in the <hi>Person of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When thou art come never so little past the <hi>lusts</hi> of the Flesh; thou shalt
meet with him, whom thy Soul loveth, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in his <hi>Shadow.</hi> This will
be an <hi>Earthly Paradise</hi> to thee springing up thorow thy body, thy senses, all vsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things round about thee. When thou art come never so little past the <hi>Flesh</hi>
itself, and all Appearances of things in that; thou shalt meet with him, whom
thy Soul loveth, in a lively, lovely <hi>Picture,</hi> thy <hi>Jesus</hi> in the Form of an <hi>Angel.</hi>
All that was dear to thee, and present with thee in the <hi>dark shadow,</hi> thou shalt
now see again with gain, and enjoy in the <hi>bright Picture.</hi> Thy <hi>Earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi>
shall be grown up, transformed, and enlarged with thee into a <hi>Heaven of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:49838:122"/>
Angels.</hi> When thou art come never so little past these <hi>Watchmen</hi> themselves,
the <hi>Angels,</hi> without the walls of the City of this whole Creation; thou shalt
meet with him, whom thy Soul loves, the Lord Jesus in his naked, living, and
eternal Beauties. Here thou shalt see the <hi>Light of Life</hi> far above all <hi>Shadows</hi>
and <hi>Pictures,</hi> enlarging itself to take in, and comprehend them also. Not only
the <hi>Persons,</hi> and <hi>Things</hi> represented in those lower Scenes, and Forms: but the
Scenes, and Forms themselves appear again, and appear eternally in this last
and highest opening of the Mystery of God. Not only that <hi>Rose,</hi> which was
the Treasure hid in the <hi>Seed,</hi> the <hi>Stalk,</hi> the <hi>Leaf,</hi> the <hi>Thorn,</hi> sheweth itself full
blown in all its Beauties, and Sweetnesses, but that <hi>Seed; Stalk;</hi> each <hi>Leaf;</hi>
every thing of the <hi>Rose-Tree;</hi> every <hi>dust</hi> of the Earth round about it, is now
a <hi>Distinct Rose.</hi> This is the <hi>Rose of Sharon,</hi> our <hi>Jesus</hi> seen, <hi>as he is,</hi> the vail taken
off in the Gospel by the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> Follow after Holiness in all degrees of it,
that you may see this <hi>Jesus,</hi> as he ascends thorow all Degrees of things. Fly
from every degree of uncleanness which will be a spot upon your Garments,
that the Beauties of <hi>Christ</hi> cannot shine in them, neither in your outward, and
Earthly, or your Inward, Angelical Garment.</p>

                  <hi>John. He that hateth his
Brother, walketh in darkness until now.</hi> Every Saint, every Man, every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
each Providence is our Brother, as it is the work of God, the Birth of
God by <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and beareth the Image of him, who is the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of
God. All <hi>Hatred</hi> is a Twin-birth with <hi>Darkness.</hi> Both arise immediately out
of the departure and separation from the <hi>Unity,</hi> which is the womb, from
whence spring together that Blessed Pair, <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> All Enmity and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
besides that, which is the loving, and lovely opposition of <hi>Love</hi> itself to
<hi>Hatred,</hi> and Enmity, is the seed of the Serpent, out of which himself ariseth,
and by which he propagateth his Serpentine brood. The <hi>Jews</hi> say in their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs;
The Spirit of God resteth not upon an Angry, or a sad Man.</hi> While thy
Soul is wrapt up in a black Cloud of Malice, or tossed with any Tempest of
wrath, the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> the Glorious Person of thy Saviour, which is all an
immortal Flame of Love appeareth not to thee, neither can it be seen by thee,
all whose Lovelinesses are the Beauties, and Beams of Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom. 3. 24. Jesus Christ</hi> is called the <hi>Propitiation.</hi> This was in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
and Temple the <hi>Golden Mercy-Seat,</hi> on which God sat between the
<hi>Cherubims,</hi> and talked with <hi>Moses.</hi> In allusion to this we read of the <hi>Throne of
Grace, Heb.</hi> 4. 16. The <hi>Person of Christ</hi> in his Heavenly Form is <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation,
the Golden Mercy-Seat, the Throne of Grace, the Throne of Love,</hi> of
the <hi>freest, sweetest, purest Love,</hi> If you streighten a Flame, and bar it from its
<hi>Liberty</hi> of extending, and dilating itself, you extinguish it, and lose at once its
<hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Heat.</hi> If you contract the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in you by Wrath, or
Enmity, you make your self uncapable of the sweet <hi>Light</hi> of his Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and of the Heavenly <hi>Heat</hi> of his Graces, and Consolations. While there
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:49838:122"/>
is among you strife, anger, malice, murmurings, whisperings, hard thoughts,
evil speakings, or any such thing; Heaven is not now open upon you, neither
do you see <hi>Jesus,</hi> as he comes up out of the Baptism of his Sufferings into a
Resurrection of Glory with the Eternal Spirit in the Form of a <hi>Dove,</hi> in a
Form of <hi>Love</hi> resting upon him.</p>
               <p>The Priests in the Temple were Morning and Evening to trim the Lamps
in the Golden Candlestick by pouring in fresh Oil, that the Light might not
go out by day, nor by night. Your Persons, O ye Saints, are the Temple, your
Spiritual and Divine part the Golden Candlestick, the Heavenly Person of
your beloved is the Light in the Lamps of this Candlestick. If you would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this Light of Glory continually shining in you, be continually pouring
in from that vessel of Love, the Heart of the Father, fresh Love, which is
the Golden Oyl of the Spirit, in which the Life, and Light of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
burneth, and shineth eternally.</p>
               <p>But to conclude my discourse concerning these <hi>Three Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Scripture</hi> saith; <hi>Covetousness is Idolatry.</hi> We make an Idol of every
Image besides the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> alone, which we set up in our Hearts, as real, and
excellent to bow down our Souls to it by our esteem, and affection. Every Idol
hath its Devil in it. <hi>St. Paul</hi> saith plainly; <hi>What the Gentiles Sacrifice to Idols,
they Sacrifice to Devils. You cannot eat of the Table of the Lord,</hi> which is his
<hi>Glorified Person,</hi> to feast upon the Delicacies of his Beauties set before your
Spirits there, and <hi>eat of the Table of Devils,</hi> which is this world; to feed upon
the Dainties of the Flesh here. <hi>You cannot drink of the cup of the Lord,</hi> which
is <hi>his Spirit,</hi> to take in the Wine of Spiritual Sweetnesses from this, <hi>and drink
of the Cup of Devils,</hi> which is the Spirit of this World, to swallow down the
riches, and pleasant things of that.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. We read of <hi>Spots</hi> at the <hi>Feasts</hi> of the Saints, who are
those that have <hi>Eyes full of Adultery. St. Jude</hi> expoundeth those <hi>Feasts</hi> to be
<hi>Feasts of Charity,</hi> that is, <hi>Love-Feasts,</hi> which were Joyned with the Supper of
the Lord. The Appearances of <hi>Christs Person</hi> in the <hi>Visible, Angelic. l, Divine</hi>
Images, are our several <hi>Love-Feasts.</hi> An adulterous Eye in the moral sense, which
looketh upon any visible Object after an undue manner, is a <hi>Spot</hi> upon the
<hi>First Love-Feast.</hi> The adulterous Eye in a legal sense, which looketh upon any
Fleshly, or visible Figure of things, is a <hi>Spot</hi> upon the <hi>Second.</hi> The adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Eye, which setteth its Love upon Created Forms on Earth, or in Heaven,
is a <hi>Spot</hi> upon the <hi>Last,</hi> and <hi>best Love-Feasts.</hi> All these <hi>Spots</hi> are Clouds upon
the <hi>Person,</hi> and stains upon the Beauty of <hi>Christ,</hi> which at once dishonour
and grieve him, darken and defile us, making us unworthy, and uncapable of
his blessed Appearances to us.</p>
               <p>As an adulterous Eye of Lust, so the blood-shot Eye of Wrath is unable to
look upon this Heavenly Object, or to bear the brightness of his Glory.</p>
               <p>I will wind up this <hi>Use</hi> with this solemn adjuration, and charge: If there
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49838:123"/>
be such a Person as our <hi>Jesus;</hi> if this Person have such unsearchable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Beauty, and Joy in it; if the presence, and appearance of this King
in his Beauty, as a Bridegroom, as a Spiritual Sun in the hearts of the Saints be
no dream, or fancy, but the very Spirit, and Truth, and Life of the Gospel; I
adjure, and charge you, all his Saints, by the <hi>Hinds,</hi> and <hi>Roes of the Field,</hi> by
the lovely <hi>Person</hi> of your <hi>Christ,</hi> by the pleasantness of his Appearances in
you, that laying aside <hi>Covetousness;</hi> casting away all <hi>Filthiness</hi> both
of <hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> putting off all Wrath, Malice, Envyings, and
evil speakings, you fix your Eye upon, fill your Souls with the Beautiful, and
blessed Person of the Lord Jesus. This is your own Fountain. Drink waters
from this Fountain alone. Behold your selves, one another, all things in the
Light of <hi>this Person,</hi> of these Beauties, as they lie here, as they are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in this fairest, greatest, and most Divine Image of all Loveliness. <hi>Christ</hi>
is <hi>the Truth.</hi> The Appearance of things in the sweet Light of his lovely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is <hi>True,</hi> This is that Truth, which if you walk in it, shall dwell with you
for ever, shining with a precious, and living lustre in the darkest places of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
or Death. In this Truth live at peace, live in love within your selves, with
one another, with all things. So the God of Peace, and Love shall be with you.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. I now come to the <hi>Third Reason</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine, our Lord Jesus is
the fairest of all things, because he hath all the parts of Beauty compleat, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
in his person.</hi> That work with my own Spirit, and with all Spirits, which
is my design, and delight, is to woo them for <hi>Christ,</hi> and espouse them, as chast
Virgins to <hi>Christ. Eccles.</hi> 12. 10. We read, that <hi>the Preacher sought out accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
words, and the words, which he found out were upright. Solomon</hi> was a figure
of <hi>Christ in glory,</hi> King in the <hi>Hierusalem above.</hi> This Glorious Person
is the Preacher, the Text, and the Sermon. <hi>Acceptable words</hi> in the
Original Language are <hi>words of delight,</hi> as you may see in the Margin. If ever
it be fit to seek out pleasant, and delightful words; it is on this Subject,
when we treat of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and <hi>his Beauties.</hi> If ever it be necessary
to take care to speak right words; it is now, when we speak of him, whose
<hi>Person</hi> is the Center, from which all the lines of the Gospel, of Evangelical
Truths, Graces, Comforts, Glories, Spirits are drawn; into which they all run;
in which they all meet. My endeavour therefore is, that all my discourses may
be steps from one Scripture to another, that by the explications, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of these I may enlighten your minds to the sight, and warm your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the love of these Blessed and Heavenly Beauties.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>four Parts,</hi> of which all Beauty consisteth; 1. <hi>Variety. 2. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in the variety. 3. Light in the Harmony. 4. Life in that Light.</hi> These
<hi>four</hi> meet all eminently, and transcendently, in the highest degree in the <hi>Person</hi>
of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>1. There is <hi>all variety</hi> in the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> Colos. 1. 19. <hi>It pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49838:123"/>
the Father, that in him all fulness should dwell.</hi> Observe how St. <hi>Paul</hi>
cometh to this total Sum at the foot of the Account, to this Conclusion of <hi>all
Fulness in Christ.</hi> From the 15<hi>th v.</hi> to <hi>this</hi> you have the whole Compass of
Things in <hi>Nature, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> From the 15<hi>th</hi> to the 18<hi>th</hi> you have
the Circuit of <hi>Nature</hi> in the full extent of the Creation with its Creator. <hi>First</hi>
there is <hi>God,</hi> as he is the Author of Nature. <hi>Jesus Christ is the Image of the
Invisible God;</hi> v. 15. Then you have the whole <hi>Creation. He is the First-born
of every Creature;</hi> or <hi>of all the Creation.</hi> The <hi>First-born</hi> is the <hi>Excellency
of Dignity,</hi> the <hi>Excellency of Strength.</hi> Every Creature is in <hi>Christ,</hi> as in the
<hi>Excellency of the Divine Strength.</hi> in its Divine Root, Power, Life, Vertue;
as in the <hi>Excellency of the Divine Dignity;</hi> in its Divine Form, Beauty and
Fruit. As our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is <hi>the Image of the Invisible God,</hi> so the whole Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
lieth in him, as in a Glorious Fountain-Head, in a Beautiful Womb, in
a Beautiful Pattern, in one entire Form of Beauty. As our <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> is the
<hi>First-born of every Creature;</hi> so each Creature is seen distinctly in Him, and
he appeareth distinctly in each Creature, in its Primitive, Pure, Paradisical
State.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>next</hi> place you have this <hi>General</hi> drawn down into <hi>Particulars,</hi> the
<hi>Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>Earth;</hi> the <hi>Visible,</hi> the <hi>Invisible</hi> things of the Creature;
Angels with all their Orders; all comprehended in the Light of <hi>Christ's
Beauties,</hi> like the living Creatures in the <hi>White Sheet</hi> let down out of Heaven
to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as he prayed on the top of the house. All are <hi>For, By, In Him;</hi>
v. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> For a close you have all the Forms of Nature, like Flowers of Silk
in a Garment of Needle-work, shining together in the <hi>Person of Christ;</hi> v. 19.
We read in the latter part of that <hi>verse, All things subsist by him.</hi> It is in
<hi>Greek</hi> word for word, <hi>All things have subsisted together in him.</hi> As Beams of
Light stand in the Sun, and out of the Sun; such a Sun is Jesus Christ, such
a Visible Image of the Invisible God at the Head of the Creation, <hi>in</hi> which,
and <hi>out</hi> of which all the Creatures stand; like a Bright, and mysterious knot
of Millions of Distinct Beams: As a great and fresh Picture taken from the
Life made up of many less Pictures, which stand in it, of which, several Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
are taken from itself, and Copy from Copy: So is our Beloved <hi>the first
born of every Creature,</hi> in which all the Creatures subsist together in their <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Distinctions,</hi> and their <hi>Universal Harmony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this <hi>first Circuit</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> passeth to the <hi>second Circuit</hi> of
<hi>Grace, v.</hi> 18. Here also all things appear <hi>in Christ,</hi> as their <hi>first Principle,</hi> and
their <hi>proper Habitation,</hi> Jude. The <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>All,</hi> the distinct <hi>Root,</hi> and
<hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>each</hi> Spiritual Plant. <hi>He is the Head of the Church; the Beginning,</hi>
the Principle; the <hi>first-born from the Dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both these <hi>Circuits.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> bringeth into one <hi>Divine Circle</hi> of <hi>Christ's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Person,</hi> like two distinct and pleasant Apartments, one excelling the other
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49838:124"/>
in Riches, Greatness, and Beauty, within the same Palace, in which all the
pleasures of the God-Head, and of the Father, lie. <hi>For it pleased the Father
that in him should all fulness dwell.</hi> v. 19.</p>
               <p>Thus we see how St. <hi>Paul</hi> bringeth all <hi>fulness</hi> through all <hi>Generals,</hi> and
<hi>Particulars</hi> of things every where into <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> like the Silver and Gold
out of all the Mines of Nature, and Grace, refined, and fashioned by the
Hand of a curious Workman, the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> into one Jewel.</p>
               <p>Behold! <hi>All Fulness,</hi> the Fulness of all <hi>kinds</hi> and <hi>Degrees; All Fulness,</hi>
the Fulness of all <hi>Things,</hi> Invisible, and Visible; Angels, and Men; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Earth; Flesh, and Spirit; God, and the Creature; <hi>All Fulness,</hi>
the Fulness of all <hi>States,</hi> Light, and Darkness; Honour and Dishonour;
Pain, and Pleasure; the Griefs of all Sufferings, the Joy of all Glories; the
deepest Guilt of Sin; the brightest Crown of Righteousness; <hi>He was made Sin
for us, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him;</hi> Life, Death,
the Resurrection from the Dead, Immortality; The Earth with its nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
parts, the Heavens with all the Heights above them; in a word, Love
and Wrath with all their Changes, and Dresses; <hi>All Fullness</hi> dwelleth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O the Greatness of the Majesty, and Fulness of this Heavenly Person! <hi>Job</hi>
saith of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which is one of the names of <hi>Christ,</hi> Job. 11. v. 6. <hi>The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of Wisdom; it is double to that which is.</hi> The <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of its Spiritual Treasures, containeth all things, which are, and appear
in the Light and Eye of the Creature; and besides these which are <hi>Copies,</hi>
their <hi>Originals.</hi> Thus is it <hi>double to that which is;</hi> having in itself the <hi>Shadow,</hi>
and the <hi>Substance;</hi> the <hi>Picture,</hi> and the <hi>Life;</hi> whereas all <hi>that is,</hi> is <hi>Shadow,</hi>
and <hi>Picture</hi> only. The <hi>Platonists</hi> call Secondary, and created Beings; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Beings;</hi> the Original they call <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an <hi>Unity above all Being.</hi> But
<hi>Job</hi> going on to speak of Jesus-Christ, addeth; <hi>Canst thou find out the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
to Perfection?</hi> v. 7. <hi>As high as Heaven, deeper than Hell;</hi> v. 8. <hi>The
Measure thereof is longer than the Earth, broader than the Sea.</hi> That is observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
The Divine <hi>Wisdom</hi> called also the <hi>Almighty,</hi> is <hi>as high as Heaven;</hi> but
<hi>deeper than Hell.</hi> His <hi>Heights are all Heavens;</hi> and his <hi>Depths</hi> are <hi>Heaven
below Hell</hi> itself. What are the Dimensions, what are the Comprehensions
of this Spiritual Person? It is the Heaven of Heavens for height of Glory.
It stretcheth the Compass of its everlasting Beauties and sweetnesses, beneath
Hell itself, comprehending that in its Depths, amidst the precious things of its
sacred deep below. Its Measure extendeth beyond both Earth and Sea in all
their Literal and Mystical Images. As the Earth hangeth in the midst of
the Air; as the Air moveth in the bosom of Heaven: So Earth, Hell, Sea,
Air, Heaven, and all live, move, and have their Being in this most high
Person, and Spirit. O the Greatness of the Majesty, and Fulness of
Christ!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:49838:124"/>
I think not fit to pass over this <hi>Part</hi> of our Saviours Beauty, the variety in
him, without <hi>Two Notes; one</hi> of the happiness of Believers; the other of the
Unhappiness of Sinners.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Note.</hi> How happy are they, who are persuaded in their hearts to trust
in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and by faith to abide in him? They dwell together with, and
in all Fulness. When they travel through the valley of <hi>Baca,</hi> of <hi>Weeping;</hi>
they go <hi>from Strength to Strength,</hi> from <hi>one part</hi> of the <hi>Variety,</hi> from one
<hi>Beauty,</hi> in the Person of their <hi>Beloved</hi> to another; So they see, the <hi>God of Gods</hi>
in <hi>Sion;</hi> the open face, and full Beauties of their Bridegroom in the Unity of
His eternal Person, and Spirit in every form of things. Every <hi>Pit</hi> the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and darkest is filled with Divine Beauties in him, and his Fulness.</p>
               <p>Psal. 139. v. 6. <hi>David</hi> cryeth out; <hi>This Knowledge is too wonderful for
me.</hi> The <hi>Name,</hi> that is, the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> that is, <hi>God with
us.</hi> Mat. 1. v. 23. God inhabiting all Forms of things, that all Fulness may
dwell in him, and so he may be with a Believer, a Believer with him every
where, at all times. <hi>David</hi> was in this Contemplation of <hi>Christ's Person,</hi> and
ravished with it; <hi>Thou compassest my path;</hi> v. 3. <hi>Thou hast beset me behind and
before,</hi> v. 6. I am encompassed, and shut in with thy Person behind, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
from Eternity to Eternity; in every Form of Darkness, or Light;
Earthly, or Heavenly. I am still with thee. All these are Varieties only in
thee. It is thy self, thy Person, besetteth, compasseth, comprehendeth me,
and my way in them all. O Believers, when you see <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the least
glance of <hi>His Person</hi> with the same Eye of Light, and Love, as <hi>David</hi> saw
him with; do not you also meet with wonders of Delight, and Glory, which
are too great for your Hearts, Affections, or Understandings to take in? Do
not the lowest, and least things seen in him, appear to you as Divine
Wonders, with such a height of Light in them, as no created Eye can
reach.</p>
               <p>But <hi>David</hi> caught up into the view, and Embraces of <hi>Jesus</hi> in his Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Form proceedeth in his Rapture; <hi>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall I flee from thy Presence, Face, or Person?</hi> v. 7. The <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the
<hi>Presence,</hi> or <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> are here both one, to teach us, that this <hi>Person,</hi>
and Presence of our Saviour, in which he is the <hi>same, yesterday, to day, and
for ever,</hi> in His Appearances to the Saints under the <hi>Law,</hi> under <hi>Grace,</hi> in
<hi>Glory</hi> is entirely <hi>Spiritual,</hi> a <hi>pure Spirit. If I ascend up into Heaven, thou art
there; if I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there;</hi> v. 8. <hi>Hell</hi> in <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
and <hi>Greek</hi> signifies no more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the <hi>Grave,</hi> or the <hi>State</hi> of the Dead. It is
added in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> Behold! Thou! These words, <hi>art there,</hi> are put in by the
<hi>Translatours,</hi> as you may see by the Change of the Letter. <hi>If I take the wings
of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the Sea,</hi> v. 9. <hi>even there
shall thy hand lead me, and thy right Hand shall hold me,</hi> v. 10. <hi>If I say the
Darkness shall cover me, even the Night shall be light round about me;</hi> v. 11.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:49838:125"/>
                  <hi>Yea the Darkness hideth not from thee; but the Night shineth as the Day; the
Darkness and Light are both alike to thee,</hi> v. 12. These last words too are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
<hi>to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Go thy wayes, O Believer! O beloved Spouse of this Heavenly Lover;
say to him with the same tongue, in the same language of Light, and Love,
as <hi>David</hi> doth: Wherever I fly or fall, I am ever encompassed with, ever
wrapt up in thy Spiritual, and Glorious Person, as my Heaven, as the Air of
my Life, O my Beloved! If I fly, it is in the face of these Brightnesses; If I
fall, I lie in the Bosom of these Beauties. When I ascend up into <hi>Heaven,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
thou art there. <hi>Heaven</hi> is, as a great Room of State, and Pleasure in the
Divine Building of thy Person. The Light of this is all the Glory; the Love,
and Loveliness of this are all the Treasures, and feasts of Joy there. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Appearances of those Distinct Varieties in thy Person, shooting forth
themselves like Beams with a Divine Lustre, Warmth, and Life, make all the
Angels in Heaven. The Assembly of Glorified Saints is the <hi>Fruitfulness,</hi> and
<hi>Fulness</hi> of thy <hi>Person;</hi> first thy <hi>Birth,</hi> and then thy <hi>Bride;</hi> like <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi>
in Paradise; the <hi>Heavenly Eve</hi> to the <hi>Last Adam</hi> in the Heavenly Paradise;
thy <hi>self</hi> multiplying it <hi>self,</hi> that it may have a <hi>meet Help</hi> for it <hi>self</hi> to be the
<hi>Object</hi> of all its Loves, the <hi>Subject</hi> of all its Joys, the <hi>Mother of all Living.
What have I in Heaven besides thee?</hi> Ps. 73. 25. Thy Person filleth all those
shining, and smiling Forms of things in Heaven. They are all the Beauties
in thy Face; the smiles in thine Eye.</p>
               <p>If I die, <hi>behold thee!</hi> Death itself is first an <hi>extasie of Love,</hi> in which thou
overshadowest me, in a moment snatching me out of the Light of this world
into the sweet, and everlasting Light of a far greater, and more Blessed world,
thy Person. Then is it an <hi>extasie of Joy</hi> to find the same <hi>Jesus</hi> cloathed with
the same white, and shining Rayment in the Grave, as I beheld him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
The Grave becomes a Bed, and that Bed thy Bosom. <hi>Luke 16. 22. The
Begger died, and was carried by Angels into Abrahams Bosom; the rich man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
dieth, and is buried.</hi> That which the Grave is to the rich man, that to the
Begger, to the poorest Saint, is the Bosom of <hi>Jesus,</hi> figured by <hi>Abraham,</hi> in
whom he lay hid, as the <hi>Seed</hi> of Eternity. <hi>Ere I was aware, my Soul made
me, as the Chariots of Aminadab; Cant. 7. Aminadab is my Princely Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
a Chariot of Angels of Glorious Spirits.</hi> This is the manner of the Death
of <hi>Christs</hi> Spouse: Ere she is aware her Soul setteth her upon, or rather itself
becometh to her a <hi>Chariot of Angels,</hi> where she sitteth upon a Golden Throne
of Love, encompassed with Curtains of Light, and so is transported in the
twinkling of an Eye into the Arms of her Beloved; her whole way itself
lying in the same embraces, which are the end of her way; and those Angels
being the varieties, and the movings of those Fulnesses of beauties in the <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grooms
Person,</hi> which is the same <hi>Spring,</hi> and <hi>Rest</hi> of love in them all.</p>
               <p>Go on then, believing Soul, with <hi>David,</hi> and say to thy Saviour: but the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49838:125"/>
time may come, when I shall neither rest on thy bosom, as a Throne of Grace
in Heaven, nor as a Bed in the Grave, in the Fellowship of thy Death. I may
be hurried to the uttermost parts of the Sea; to that State, where storms of
malice, and wrath rage most in the midst of the blackness of Darkness: But
when it is so, <hi>even</hi> then thou risest upon me, and sweetly breakest, like a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
morning, in the Beauties of thy Person round about me. Thou takest me
upon thy Divine Beams, as upon Silver Wings with Feathers of Gold, in
which the Glories of the Divine, and Humane Nature are united. As thou in
thy course circlest thorow all the infiniteness of differing Beauties within thy
self, thou carriest me upon these Wings of thine to the extremities of this Sea
of Darkness, and Tempests, <hi>Even</hi> here also, as in Heaven itself <hi>thy hand,</hi> which
is thy self, thy Spiritual Person, thy Divine Life in Act; the Activity, and
Appearance of thine inseparable Glories <hi>lead</hi> me, as my Strength within, my
guide and way before me, my light round about me. Yea <hi>even</hi> here <hi>thy right Hand,</hi>
which is thy Person in the sweetest, fullest Act, and appearance of Love, Beauty,
Majesty, and Power, <hi>holdeth</hi> me; at once bearing me up in itself, encompassing
with itself. Thus the Sea, and Tempests are still <hi>thy Person</hi> in the same Lovely,
and Eternal Form opening new Wonders of Beauty, and discovering greater
Riches of vaster varieties within the bright Bound of its own Spiritual Fulness.</p>
               <p>Yea if I sink so low, that I begin to faint, and say; <hi>now the Darkness will
cover,</hi> and overwhelm me; now the night will seal up my Eyes from the sight
of my Beloved, and hide him from me: then the <hi>Night</hi> it self becomes a bright
Sun round about me in the Heaven of <hi>thy Person,</hi> where every spot of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as well as Beam of Light is a shining Point, or line of Beauty; and all so
many several Suns set thick one by another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Can. 5, 11. The Head</hi> of Christ is said to be <hi>as fine Gold; the Bushes, or
Curles of his Locks black as a Raven,</hi> which is the <hi>Bird of Death.</hi> The blackest
Darknesses, with the most affrighting Horrours are but those black Locks with
their Bushes, and Curls, which grow, and live upon the Golden Head of my
<hi>Jesus,</hi> and are a principal part of thy Beauties. Thy Golden Head is in the
midst of them, shineth thorow them every where; like a mid-day Sun shedding
his Beams of Gold thorow a pleasant Grove, making so perfect, and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a mixture of the Light, and the shadow, that both seem one. The Shadow
heightens, and sweetens the Light; the Light shineth in the Shadow, sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
and softneth it. Each appeareth, as the same Beauty, the same <hi>Person of
Christ,</hi> in a different posture, in a different dress. Thus the Light and the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are both alike in thee to me. The Light is thine <hi>Eye.</hi> Thy Person is all
an Eye of Life, Beauty, Love. The Darkness is the <hi>Apple</hi> of thine <hi>Eye.</hi> Here
all inferiour excellencies are lost, and covered in a deep shade. Here thy Spirit
and Person is most naked; here it uniteth all the Beams, and Forces of its love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and love; here I see my self, mine own Image, and Person shining with
an Immortal light round about it. The Darkness is the variety making the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:49838:126"/>
Beauty, and distinguishing the unity of Light into the Riches of mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>old
Divine Colours, Shapes, and pleasant Operations of Love-delights, in thy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The Darkness is the excess, and depth of thy Light swallowing up every
Eye of Nature in me, then giving me a new Eye, and a new Vision of things
in itself. <hi>Day unto day uttereth Speech; Night unto night declareth Knowledge:
Psal.</hi> 19. 2. Thou my <hi>Jesus,</hi> the Immortal word, and onely wisdom of thy
Father, art this <hi>Speech,</hi> this <hi>Knowledge.</hi> The Day and Night agree in this; both
are Divine Sounds of the <hi>Living Word;</hi> Divine Representations of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Image, Divine expressions of the eternal wisdom; that is, both are thine
Appearances, distinct Appearances of the same Beautiful Person; several parts
of the same fulness lying together, as Lines, and Colours in the delightful Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
and Face of one Transcendent, Spiritual Beauty. Thy Person appeareth
in them both with equal fulness, and is equally the fulness of both. Thus in
this one blessed Person of thine both are made one, and are alike to me. This
is the happiness of every Believer. This is my <hi>First Note.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Note. How unhappy is every Sinner, Prov.</hi> 5. 14. There is one brought
in bewailing himself: <hi>How had I almost fallen into all Sin in the midst of the
great Congregation?</hi> Thou canst never Sin out of the presence, from under the
Eye of this <hi>Jesus,</hi> whose <hi>Person</hi> is the <hi>great Assembly</hi> of all Living, Immortal
Beauties, pure Beauties, Spiritual, the Beauties of Holiness. A Poet in a clear
night surprized by Thieves, as he Travelled, when they were now about to
murther him, pointing to Heaven; so many Stars, saith he, as are yonder, so
many watchful Eyes are there witnesses of this Murther: So many Forms of
things, as are round about thee; so many Eyes of Heavenly Beauties look upon
thee, make the darkest night to shine bright, as day round about thee, when
thou thinkest to hide in the greatest secrecy the practice, or thought of any
Lust. When thine Eyes shall be unsealed, how will thy Spirit within thee be
amazed, and confounded, how will thine heart within thee be melted to see,
that thou hast covered thy self with the loathsom, abhorred deformities of so
many pollutions, so many profannesses in the midst of the great Congregation
of all living Lovelinesses, and Loves walking round about thee, and seeing
thee, though thou lookedst not to them? But thus much for the <hi>First part</hi> of
<hi>Beauty in Christ;</hi> the <hi>Variety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Second part</hi> is the <hi>Harmony in this Variety St. Paul</hi> after that he had
said; that <hi>all Fulness dwelt in Christ,</hi> addeth: <hi>and having made peace by his
blood</hi> it pleased the Father <hi>by him to reconcile all things to himself, whether they
be things in Heaven, or things in Earth, Col.</hi> 1. 20. The Spiritual Form of
<hi>Christ</hi> is, as a Musical Instrument. All varieties of things in Heaven and Earth
are so many strings upon this Instrument, which are all by the life and vertue of
the Instrument itself so tuned one to another, and made to sound in Consort,
that they fill the Ears of God himself with a most Divine, and pleasing Melody.</p>
               <p>There is another Scripture, which agrees with this, and goeth further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49838:126"/>
the <hi>Harmony,</hi> and the <hi>Ground</hi> of it, <hi>Ephes. 1. 10. That in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of the fulness of times he might gather together all things in One in Him,
both things in Heaven, and things on Earth, in Him.</hi> Here you have the <hi>Variety,
all Fulness, the Fulness of Times;</hi> then <hi>the Harmony;</hi> this Fulness <hi>gathered up into
One;</hi> &amp; both these in <hi>Christ, in Him.</hi> Then the <hi>Fulness</hi> is explained; <hi>Things in
Heaven, and things on Earth.</hi> Then he brings it in a second Time, <hi>in him. Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
is the ground of <hi>all Harmony.</hi> The <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>Christs Person,</hi> maketh the
<hi>Harmony</hi> in him by a concurrence of <hi>four Particulars.</hi> 1. The Unity of this
Spiritual Person, which is most entirely one, springeth up into all variety
within itself, 2. This Transcendent Unity boundeth all this infinite variety
with itself. 3. This glorious Unity runneth through the whole variety, as a
string of Silk through a row of Pearls. 4. The entire unity of this high and
Heavenly Person standeth compleat in every branch, and point of all the vast
variety at once; as the <hi>Soul</hi> is said to be <hi>all in the whole Body, and all in every
part of it;</hi> or as if the Body of the Sun in stead of encompassing the Heavens
successively should at once shine with its entire Body of Light in each point
of the Firmament, as the same, and yet so many distinct Suns, being an Unity of
all Lusters, and yet that Unity set in so many distinct Varieties, which are as
highly, and ravishingly various each from other, as the unity is one in itself.</p>
               <p>This is that wonderful <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> this is that <hi>Word,</hi> that <hi>Image of
God,</hi> which is the Supream, and Universal Harmony, the Supream, the Universal
Musick, and Beauty. This maketh all the Beauty, and Musick through Heaven.
and Earth, as it giveth forth any where any Glance, or sound of itself. This
Harmony comprehendeth all particular Musicks, and Beauties of the Creature
with their several sorts and degrees in their distinct Perfections within itself.
This maketh all things with all their motion, Musick, and Beauty by its Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Presence with them, and comprehension of them. Blessed is he who hath
a <hi>seeing Eye</hi> to discern this Beauty in every Appearance, the most rugged,
black; blessed is he who hath a hearing Ear to take in this Musick from every
motion, the most sharp, the most confused. Yea blessed is he who lies with
his whole Person, and Life wrapt up in this Harmony; who moveth, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
carried on in the Chariot, upon the Wings of this Harmony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Caution.</hi> Naturalists report a Serpent to be often bred of the Brain, and
Marrow of a mans back, when he is dead. So too often that Serpentine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
which feedeth upon the dust of sensuality, and beareth an enmity to the
Holy and Heavenly Dove, is engendred from the sweetest, and most substantial
Truths, which are as the Marrow and Brain of Divine Wisdom, when they
are become corrupted, and dead notions, in dead and corrupt Spirits. How are
these two glorious Principles the Golden P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>llars on which the Whole Gospel
is established; <hi>That all Fulness dwelleth in Christ; That every thing of Christ,
in Christ is altogether lovely;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mproved by many unto the grossest Pollutions,
and greatest Profanenesses? But these are willingly ignorant, that as <hi>God is
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49838:127"/>
the God of order, and not of confusion,</hi> so all variety lieth in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in that
perfect Harmony, which is the Beauty of Holiness, and the excellency of the
Divine Wisdom.</p>
               <p>All natural things stand in <hi>Christ</hi> in a <hi>double Harmony one with another;</hi> and
<hi>with the Divine Nature,</hi> as faultless Figures of that purity, and glory in the
Eternal Spirit. So <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is both in one, the <hi>Image of the Invisible God,</hi>
and <hi>the First-born of every Creature, Colos.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
               <p>Then this Beautiful Nature of things in <hi>Christ</hi> is made a Sacrifice upon the
Altar of the Cross in Death; that it may put off the Negative Imperfections,
the Shadowy Darkness, Slightness, Confinement, Mutability inseparable from
a meer Figure. Thus is this State of things subject to a double Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, and above it; <hi>one</hi> of <hi>its Pattern</hi> on the top of the mount above Nature;
the <hi>other</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> that it may by putting off itself in the <hi>Shadow</hi> put on
its <hi>truer self</hi> in the <hi>Eternal Original.</hi> Thus we read that <hi>Christ,</hi> as he was
the <hi>First-born of the whole Creation</hi> became <hi>the First-born from the Dead:
Colos.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>Thus thorow Death, being purified by the Blood of the Lamb the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
passeth out of that Shadowy State by rending the Vail of Flesh, where
it is in Bondage, into the Liberty of the Sons of God, where it is a Royal
Law of Life, of Love, and of Liberty to itself in the Spirit of God and of Glory.</p>
               <p>The Heavenly Person of our Lord Jesus is a Circle within a Circle.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>first</hi> and innermost Circle is the First Image of God in Nature.
This comprehendeth the whole Creation. This is made up of its Day and
Night; Light and Darkness. All things of Light, of Truth and Goodness, are
embraced by a Light of Divine Love. All things of Darkness, of the evil of sin,
lye in the Darkness of Divine wrath, where the Evil of Sufferings, as a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Fire consumeth them.</p>
               <p>2. The Circle which immediately infoldeth this, is that of the Death of
our Saviour. Here the First Image entreth into a Divine Shade, where by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
it loseth it self and vanisheth, as to its former appearances in the Figure,
sinking into its Eternal Seed. The Spirit of Glory in this Divine Shade is the
Blood of Christ purifying the Heavenly Things in the Creature by washing
away the Earthly Forms. This State the Jews call the <hi>lower Paradise,</hi> the
<hi>Paradise, under the Earth.</hi> For as a Seed hath in it self all the Beautyes, and
Sweetnesses of the whole plant under the vail of a naked Grain: so here all
things are as Spiritual, and Divine Plants full of all Beauty, and Sweetness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the covert of this Purple, Perfumed Shade of our Saviour's Death, to which
the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> was an anointing of all precious Spices, and a Lamp shining
in the midst of it. This Spirit is also, as a Fountain from <hi>Eden</hi> running along
in the midst of this Paradise, like a River, and Gardens under ground in the
Secret of the Earth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third Circle</hi> is the Kingdom and Glory of <hi>Christ.</hi> In this the two other
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49838:127"/>
Circles are seen, the First thorow the Second, as Faces in a Glass of Glory.
Here the Heaven of the God-Head is open'd, and all things appear as Angels
of God ascending, and descending in the <hi>Person of Christ.</hi> This is the <hi>Spring</hi>
of the Spirit, in which all created Forms flourish like green Leaves, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Blossoms in the Tree of Life, never to fall or fade; the Eye of the God-Head
as a rising Sun shedding for ever sweet Beams of Love, and Life upon
them.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>last</hi> and <hi>greatest Circle,</hi> the Crown of Life, and Beauty, is the Glory of
the Father. This is the Autumn, and Season for Ripe Fruit. Now is <hi>Jesus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
thither, where he was at first. Now is he revealed, who was from the
Beginning. God is the first, and the last; all in all. All things see, and enjoy
themselves; all things are seen, and enjoyed in their unchangeable Originals.
This is that Spiritual and Heavenly Form of <hi>Christs Person,</hi> into which he is
ascended; in which he is, as on the Throne of the Father, which endureth for
ever and ever; in which he hath gathered up all things into one. This is that
Head of our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> which is of the finest, and solidest Gold.</p>
               <p>Thus we have seen the <hi>Order,</hi> in which all things lie in our Saviours Person,
according to which he descendeth first, and then ascendeth within himself: The
Unity of this first and highest Form, which is the Supream and largest Circle,
the outmost, and inmost to all the rest, as their Root, and their Crown, in the
bosom of which all the rest lie as Colours and Figures in the Light. This so
goeth down into the other, that it maketh all one, and resteth itself entirely
upon each point of every one, and enfoldeth the whole in itself, so that all have
the <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>true manifestation</hi> of their <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> only, as they
lie in this pure, and perfect Light.</p>
               <p>Every inferiour Circle, or Form of things is comprehended in the Superiour,
and hath there a double Appearance. 1. <hi>In plain.</hi> So it is a native Flower in
that Mystical Garden; a fair feature in that Face of Beauty; a Spirit of that
Spirit in that Spirit, one Spirit with it. 2. In <hi>Perspective.</hi> Thus the lower is
seen in the higher, as at a distance, as at the end of a Cave, as it was in itself,
as passed away according to that fashion of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coloss. 2. 17. St. Paul.</hi> complaineth of those, who intrude themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heavenly mysteries, which they have not seen, <hi>not holding the head.</hi> These,
as <hi>St. Jude</hi> speaketh, are <hi>Sensual,</hi> that is, men acted only by a natural and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Soul, <hi>not having the Spirit.</hi> So in those things of our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> which
they know, as brute Beasts, they corrupt themselves. They have not anointed
Eyes, to see the Harmony, and Spiritual Beauty of all things in the <hi>Person</hi> of
the Lord. They discern not how the Original, and first Glories by fit steps,
shoot forth themselves into Figures, and Shadows, how they lie hid as the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Seed and Substance in them; how like the Invisible, and first Sun, they shine in
the midst of them, shine quite thorow them. They behold not the Figures
ascending like a Pillar of Smoak perfumed with all the Spices of the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49838:128"/>
from this golden Altar of Christs glorious Form comprehending them,
and being ever beneath them; how they lose themselves by degrees in the
sweet shade of <hi>Christs Death;</hi> how they spring again new in the brightness of
his Resurrection; how they lie continually in the Original Glory, where the
whole mystery is entirely comprehended, perfected, and finisht.</p>
               <p>These men set not their hearts upon this glory of the Father in <hi>Christ</hi> to
make that their Righteousness, their Strength, and their Song in every other
Appearance, as in the house of their Pilgrimage. They take no pleasure in the
joints of all the members in this Divine Body, which are Jewels wrought by
the hand of a skilful workman; this <hi>Unity</hi> being itself the mysterious joynt
every where setting all, and binding all together in itself in that <hi>Wisdom</hi> of

               <p>But enough of this <hi>Caution,</hi> and of the <hi>Second Part of Beauty</hi> in our beloved,

               </p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Third Part</hi> is the <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Harmony, John</hi> 8. 12. Our Lord
saith of himself; <hi>I am the Light of the World.</hi> As the Sun, the chief and most
glorious Body, is the Light of all Corporeal and bodily Beings: so this blessed
Person of our Saviour, the first and best Spirit is the Light of all Spirits; the
first and most Glorious Form is the Light of all Forms of Things, Bodies,
and Spirits. He is the First, the Supream, the universal Light. He is that high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Circle of Light, which rideth forth upon every Circle, or Beam of Light,
each point in every Beam, <hi>Psal. 36. 9. David</hi> saith to God; <hi>In thy Light shall
we see Light.</hi> The Light of the Father is <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the express Image and
Glory of the Father. These words of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> have <hi>Two senses.</hi> 1. As
colours are seen in the light of the Sun; so every colour, Light, and Being,
the Light of the Sun itself is seen only in the Light of <hi>Christs Person,</hi> as this
pure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and eternal Sun shineth <hi>upon</hi> every other Light and Form <hi>in</hi> it, and <hi>tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
it. 2. Every thing as it is seen in the Light of this Heavenly Form, is a
<hi>precious stone</hi> of the <hi>new Hierusalem.</hi> It hath a spark of this everlasting Light,
which playeth in it, and is incorruptible.</p>
               <p>The Sun is changed into Sack-cloath at the presence of an Angel, whose
Light so much excelleth that of the Sun, that it hath no Light, when that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Light shineth forth. The highest Angels vail their Faces with their Wings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
lose all their Light and Glory, when <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> appeareth upon the white
Throne of his proper Forms, and naked Person. What manner of Light is
this then, how pure, how full of Glory, how unexp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

This Light, this Lustre of the God-Head is that Scene, that Circle in which
all the variety, the ravishing Harmony of Things lieth in <hi>Christ.</hi> This is the
Form of his <hi>Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The <hi>last Part</hi> of <hi>Beauty in Christ</hi> is the <hi>Life in the Light.</hi> Life is a Spring
of Beings, which maketh every thing fresh, and new every moment. New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is attributed to the <hi>Spirit.</hi> The <hi>oldness</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> and the <hi>Newness</hi> of the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:49838:128"/>
                  <hi>Spirit</hi> are opposed one to another, because the <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>Life.</hi> Life is the Spring of
Motion, which is the Chiefest Charm in Beauty, and in which all Pleasures consist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jesus Christ, John</hi> 8. 12. calleth Himself <hi>the Light of Life.</hi> The <hi>Person</hi> of
our King is that Light which is the Flower, and Crown of the Divine Life;
and that life which is the lustre, the Sparkling, the Perfume of this Crown,
and Flower. He is the Fountain of Life. <hi>Psal. 36. 9. With thee is the Fountain of
Life.</hi> This Lovely Person is the Fountain of Life in the Bosom, and Heart
of the Father Himself. He is the Quickning Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 45. The Lord
is that Spirit</hi> which is in its own Essence, and proper Form: <hi>Life itself in the
Fountain,</hi> where it is most pure, most plentiful, most powerful, most pleasant.
How do all Varieties of things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of Life? How do they renew their youth, their Beauties every moment, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly?
Into what mutual traffick of Beauties, and Sweetnesses, into what unces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant,
Sprightly, Pleasant motions, what Divine Acts of Love, Joy, Delight
do they spring up? How is the Beauty, and Joy of All fulfilled in every one?
How are all the Beauties, and Joys of All eternally varied, multiplyed, and
increased, when all lye together in this Fountain of Life, and every One
hath this Fountain of Life in Himself.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Person of Christ</hi> is the Fountain of the Divine Life, that Springing
Fulness of the Divine Nature in each Form. Here the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Supreme
Love</hi> eternally generateth the Son, the <hi>Original Beauty. Both</hi> in the <hi>Spirit</hi>

               <p>1. <hi>Make the Single Person of Christ the Sole Ground of your Faith. Rom.
10. 17. Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God.</hi> Our <hi>Jesus</hi>
in His Spiritual Form of Glory is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as the Sun itself is <hi>Lux,</hi> the
<hi>First Light.</hi> The <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as the Sun-shine, <hi>Lumen,</hi> the
<hi>Secundary Light.</hi> The <hi>First is a Living Light, a Light of Life.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi>
in it self is Light alone without Life. Look thorow the outward Word for the
<hi>Person of Christ.</hi> When He cometh in to thy Soul by His Spiritual Appearance,
He will be a Light of Life in thee, at once revealing His Excellencies in thee;
Giving thee an Eye to see these Excellencies, by this Sight Setting them in
thine Heart, Setting thine Heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon them, as a Root of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Esa. 45. 22. Look to me, and be saved all ye ends of the Earth;</hi> saith <hi>Jesus</hi>
from His Throne, High, and lifted up, on which <hi>Esay</hi> saw Him sitting, which
is His Divine Form. Behold! the Person of thy Saviour setteth it self before
thee to attract and allure thine Eye by the Light of His Beauties. When thou
lookest to Him. He holdeth thine Heart fast for ever fixt, as a Seal, upon His
Heavenly form by the Fulness of all things Good, Great, and Glorious in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49838:129"/>
He soweth the seed of his own Form and Fulness in thee by the flowing
forth of the Life together with the Light of his Beauties.</p>
               <p>All Objects for Faith to fix upon; the answers of all objections against be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;
the way to believe; the power of believing; the act of Faith itself;
with the Sweetness, and Fruits of it; all these lie folded up in the rich Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of <hi>Christs Person;</hi> all these flow in at once upon the Soul, spring up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in it, at the unvailing of the Face of the <hi>Lord Jesus;</hi> as the whole
knot of Beams pour out themselves in a moment thorow all the Air to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
quicken, beautify and cheer it, when once the Body of the Sun appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
Look then to <hi>Jesus,</hi> O poor burthened Spirit. Look to him that his Light
may shew him; that his Living Light may be an Eye in thee to see him; that
thorow this Eye thou mayst drink in by the streams of this Light of Life, him,
and all his Beauties to be a Well springing up to all Grace and Glory, to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Life in thee.</p>
               <p>I shall divide this <hi>Exhortation</hi> into <hi>Two Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Let the single <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> be the <hi>only ground</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> in thee unto
<hi>justification,</hi> Es. 60. 1. <hi>Arise, and shine; for the Glory of the Lord is risen upon
thee.</hi> Thou who lyest in the Dust, bearing thy shame, as one free among the
Dead, be no longer unbelieving, but believe. <hi>The Person of Christ</hi> in the Glory
of the Father is risen upon <hi>thee,</hi> filleth all things round about thee; arise and
shine in the brightness of his Appearance. Consider the Fulness of Beauties
in <hi>Christ,</hi> and say thus with thy self; <hi>Hath the Sun Beauty enough to gild every
Dung-hill, and Dung-heap here below, though that be on Earth, and he in Heaven?</hi>
Is not my <hi>Jesus</hi> then rich enough in Glories to overspread my shame, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
to make my Person shine in the Beams of his; though he be higher
than the Heavens; I fal'n down to the nethermost parts of the Earth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ther Person of Christ</hi> is an <hi>overflowing Sea</hi> of Spiritual Beauties. For <hi>all
Fulness dwelleth in him.</hi> If thou canst not cast thy self into him; stand still,
and see how he breaks forth on every side, cometh on upon thee with mighty
Floods, with a Deluge of Light and Beauty till he cover thee, and swallow
thee up into his Bottomless depths of pure and Divine Glory, as a vessel in the
Ocean, which is fill'd within, and overflown without with the Waters of the
great, and wide Sea.</p>
               <p>2. Let the single <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> be the <hi>sole Ground</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> unto <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
All Fulness, the Fulness</hi> of a <hi>Sea,</hi> and of a <hi>Spring,</hi> is in <hi>Jesus Christ,
Num.</hi> 21. 17, 18. You have an excellent Figure in a History. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel</hi> wanted water in the Wilderness. God gave them a Well. Then
they sung this Song. <hi>They encompassed the Well; they sung to it, Spring O Well;
the Princes digged it with their Staves at the direction of the Law-giver.</hi> Dost
thou want streams of Grace? Is thy Soul a dry and barren Wilderness? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<hi>Jesus,</hi> whom God hath given thee for a <hi>Well.</hi> At the direction of this
Law-giver dig up the ground in thine heart, till this <hi>Well,</hi> this <hi>Jesus</hi> appear.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49838:129"/>
Then whatever Grace thou wantest, at all times encompass his Spiritual Person
in thy Soul, and sing to him; <hi>Spring O Well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joh. 4. 14. The Water which I will give him,</hi> saith <hi>Jesus Christ, shall be a
Well springing up in Him unto everlasting Life.</hi> Take but in One Drop, the least
Drop of the Sweetness of Christ, the least glance of His Beauty into thy Spirit;
in this thou takest in the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ Himself,</hi> the <hi>Fountain,</hi> that shall
spring up within thee unto the Life of Holiness which is the same for <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>Duration</hi> with Eternal Life in Heaven; <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Incorruptible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Make the Single Person of Christ the only Object of thy Love.</hi> Let all the
Fulness of thy <hi>Love</hi> be poured forth upon <hi>this Person,</hi> which hath <hi>All Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of <hi>Beauty</hi> in Him.</p>
               <p>There is a <hi>Twofold Love;</hi> of <hi>Benevolence;</hi> of <hi>Complacency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Love thy Lord Jesus with all thy Love of Benevolence.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth,
<hi>Philip. 2. 21. Every man seeketh his own things: no man the things of
Jesus Christ.</hi> Seek, and pray for the prosperity of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> all thy daies in
<hi>His Truths,</hi> in <hi>His Graces;</hi> in <hi>His Glory</hi> thorow the whole Earth; in <hi>His
Church;</hi> in <hi>every Creature,</hi> where he is sown as a Seed. Love him with the
Love of Wife, Children, Friend, Country, Parents, Life, <hi>In Isaac shall thy
Seed be called,</hi> said God to <hi>Abraham.</hi> In <hi>Jesus</hi> let all Relations, even of <hi>thy
self,</hi> to <hi>thy self,</hi> have their Name, Truth and Vertue to thee. Let all those
Blessings, with which thou shalt bless any of these, come upon the Head of
the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> Wish well to, bless all these in the name of the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> Say
continually, let the <hi>Immortal Word upon its Wheels</hi> run, and be glorified thorow
all these, thorow the whole Heavens and Earth. Those that are Florists and
love Flowers, procure the choicest slips of Flowers, set them in their Gardens,
water them, watch them, cherish them with the greatest tenderness and care.
So do thou love <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Be continually sowing and setting him, his Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in thine own, in every Spirit, in every Appearance. Water them, cherish
them by Word, Example, Faith, Prayer. Go out often into the Fields; go down
often into the Gardens to see whether these precious Plants bud and Blossom.</p>
               <p>2. Love the Person of thy Beloved with all thy Love of Complacency, <hi>Prov.</hi>
18. 1. A man through desire se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or with all Substance. <hi>Behold here the Spouse her love of Complacency to her
Spiritual Bridegroom in</hi> three Steps; Desire; Separation; Enjoyment.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Desire.</hi> Thy Saviour is called in the Prophet, <hi>Hag. 2. 7. The desire of all
Nations.</hi> Thy <hi>Jesus,</hi> who hath all Beauties for all Eyes and Spirits, who hath
all desirable things in himself, is the desire of all Nations. Shall not he then
be the desire of all Principles, and Powers of Life or Being, in thy whole
Spirit, Soul, and Body? shall not he be the Object of all thy desires? <hi>This
Person,</hi> who is the Sealed Sum, and perfection of all Beauties, putteth this Song
into thy mouth, <hi>Can. 7. 10. My Beloved is mine, and I am his, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
is towards me.</hi> As the <hi>word</hi> there signifieth; he continually is circling round
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49838:130"/>
about me, hovering over me with the Eyes of all his Beauties, and Loves, upon
me; as a Kite about his Prey. Do thou add to thy Song this part also; <hi>and
my desire is toward him,</hi> Psal. 27. <hi>David</hi> saith; <hi>one thing have I desired of the
Lord, that I may be all the days of my life in his Temple, beholding his Beauty, and
seeking still.</hi> The Heavenly Form of Christ is the <hi>Temple,</hi> or <hi>Palace;</hi> and the
<hi>God,</hi> or <hi>King</hi> in it, the Beauty of all. Say thou to <hi>Jesus Christ: I now, for
what is my sighing before thee? This is all my desire; that I may be continually
in the Heavenly Light, and Divine Form of thy Person; that I may be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
feasting all my Faculties and Senses on thy Beauties, and endlesly</hi> making
fresh Discoveries of new Beauties in thee.</p>
               <p>2. Separation, Cant. 8. 6. <hi>The</hi> Church <hi>cryeth to</hi> Christ; Set me as a Seal
upon thine Heart, as a Seal upon thine Arm. For Iealousy (that is, Love in its
Strength, at its Height) is strong as Death, cruel as the Grave, the flame of it is
as the Flame of the Lord. Love <hi>and</hi> Death <hi>both agree in this that they are a</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
I protest by my Rejoycing in Iesus Christ, I dye dayly; <hi>saith</hi> St. Paul.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Love</hi> of a Saint to <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is a <hi>Daily Death; a Separation</hi> from
all created Objects, a Retirement out of this whole World visible, or invisible,
into the World of the Blessed, that World of Eternal Light, and Beauty;
to be alone with Him, and in Him; to be inseparably united in One Love, in
One Loveliness; in One Spring, and One Stream of Beauties with Him, <hi>as a
Seal upon His Heart, as a Seal upon His Arm.</hi> Where we read, <hi>Cant. 8. 6. Love
is strong as Death, cruel as the grave; the coals thereof are coals of Fire, which
hath a most vehement flame, which hath,</hi> is put in by the Translatours, <hi>a most
vehement Flame,</hi> is in Hebrew, <hi>the Flame of Jah;</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> of <hi>Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Learn here the Divine Mystery of <hi>Love in Death.</hi> The Death of a Believer,
a Lover of <hi>Christ,</hi> is Love itself, which is the Fire of God burning from the
Center of our Spirits, from beneath the Foundations of our Natural Being,
till it have consumed the whole frame of this Creation in us, and transformed
us into one everlasting Flame with itself; till it have separated us from every
Form of things into his own Shining, and Flourishing Form, which is the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our Beloved; the Temple, Palace, Paradise</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> of the <hi>God-Head,</hi>
which is that <hi>Primitive, the purest Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Enjoyment.</hi> This is the <hi>Third Step</hi> in the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Complacency. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling

Substance,</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> The Fulness of things in Harmony, as they make all

The <hi>Hebrew word</hi> to <hi>intermeddle</hi> signifieth to <hi>mingle with,</hi> or roul our selves
in the midst of all Wisdom, and Substance, that is, <hi>in the Bosom of Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O believing, loving Soul! Thy Beloved, when He cometh into thy Spirit,

precious, and incorruptible Fruits in thy Person, together with their Root, thy
Person. So I transplant them into my Spirit and Person. I eat of the excellencies
of Wisdom, which are sweeter to my Soul, than Honey is to the Palate, I eat them
in, and with thy Person, the essence of Wisdom itself, as live Honey with the
Honey-comb. I drink in my Wine and my Milk; the Spirit, and Sweetness of thy

in the midst of all Beauties and Delights. Here I rest in Eternal Ioy with the
perfect Complacency of all my Faculties, of my whole Spirit, Soul and Body, in
thine Heavenly Person.</p>
               <p>3. Make the single Person of Christ the Fountain of all thy Comforts.</p>

doth it make the heart in our bosom leap to him, and dance about him, as the
Needle to the Loadstone?</p>
               <p>To go forth in a fair Summers day to look upon the green Fields, and clear

see that New Heaven, and New Earth, which he maketh in himself. As Snow
at the shining forth of the Sun; so will the heaps of Snow, the Mists and
Clouds about your Heart dissolve into an unexpressible Sweetness, and Light
of a secret Joy and hope at this Sight. By the <hi>Light</hi> of the Beauties of this

                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. I come now to the 4<hi>th</hi> and <hi>last Reason,</hi> why <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is the
<hi>Fairest</hi> of all things. <hi>All Beauty is derived from Him.</hi> Beauty any where
in the Creature is an Image of the Divine Nature, by which that maketh it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
visible, testifieth its Presence, awakeneth the Soul to a sense of <hi>itself,</hi> and
to seek after it. The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is the First Image of the Invisible God, the
Supream Beauty. So every other Image, is drawn from Him, dependeth upon
Him, and is comprehended primitively, purely in Him. Every other Beauty is
a <hi>Copy</hi> of Him, taken from Him, who alone is the <hi>Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. All things are made <hi>by Christ,</hi> invisible, visible; in Heaven, on
Earth; Angels; all were made <hi>by Him,</hi> and <hi>for Him; by Him,</hi> as the <hi>Exemplar
Cause, for him,</hi> as the <hi>End,</hi> that thorow the <hi>Picture</hi> the <hi>Person</hi> Himself might, as
a Sleeping Seed, stir up itself, and spring in the Light of every understanding
and sense, in the Love of every Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All Things are By</hi> Christ <hi>Two ways,</hi> 1. As the Pattern of the Work: 2. As
the Power Working.</p>
               <p>1. Every thing is <hi>by Christ,</hi> as the Pattern of the Work. Our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is
the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God. Wisdom is an Inward Image in every Spirit, according to
which it ordereth its way, and fashioneth its work that the Whole may be One
Piece, and a Beauty may result from the agreement of all Parts in the unity of
the whole; as also from the Harmony of the outward Form, and the Inward
Image, which by their mutual reflections pour forth pleasures, and joys into
the bosom of each other. In Nature the Spirit included in the Seed of a Rose,
hath within it self the Image of a Rose-tree, with all its proportions; leaves and
flowers; beauties and sweetnesses, several growths, the bud, and the full-blown
Rose. According to this Image, the Seed putteth forth it self; the Spirit in the
Seed formeth it self upon the outward Matter, and figureth the whole Plant in
all the progress, and perfections of it. The <hi>Person</hi> of our Beloved is the onely
Image in that <hi>Eternal Spirit,</hi> which is God blessed for ever. In this glorious
Image doth He ride forth upon the face of the whole Creation from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to the end. In all His works of Power and Providence, He consulteth
onely with this Beautiful Image in His own Breast, in which all the Treasures
of Wisdom and Knowledge, all the Patterns of Beauty and Excellency are
laid up. He figureth this Image upon every Creature, and Work: he fixeth this
Image itself in every Creature, and Work, which by the lustre of its presence,
putteth a Life in the Figure, and giveth a gloss to it, as the Sun-shine to a Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 40. 38, 39. We have the History of <hi>Jacob</hi> laying streaked and
speckled rods in the Water-troughs before the Cattel. When they came to
drink, they saw these, conceived, and brought forth their young streaked, and
speckled like to these. Thus God the Father in all the Excellencies of the God-Head
generateth <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and setteth his Person before him. When he
cometh to drink of these waters of Life, to take in, and feast himself upon the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:49838:132"/>
Joys of his own Essence, and of the Divine Nature, he hath his Beloved Son
in his Eye continually. From this Beatifical vision he is filled with the Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Forms of his Son's Beauties. From this Fulness the Father becometh
Fruitful, and bringeth forth the Creation with all the Forms, and changes of it
in the Figure of these Eternal Glories.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>All things are by Christ,</hi> as the <hi>Power working, Job 38. 14. It is turned
as Clay to the Seal; they stand as a Garment.</hi> How sweet, and clear a Depth is
this Text? How doth <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in it shine from the Face of every Creature,
and from the unfathomable Light of his own Person? What is this <hi>it, it is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi>
You shall see in the <hi>verse</hi> immediately before, <hi>it is</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is taken for the whole Creation in the language of the Scripture, as
<hi>Heaven</hi> for God. But what is this <hi>Seal,</hi> to which the <hi>Earth</hi> is turned like <hi>Clay?
Two verses</hi> before will shew you, that this <hi>Seal</hi> is the <hi>Day-light. Luk. 1. 78.
Zacharias</hi> in his Song expresseth <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> by this name, the <hi>Day-spring:</hi> These
are his words; <hi>The Day-spring from on high hath visited us.</hi> As the <hi>Day-light,</hi>
when it springeth in the morning, overspreadeth the whole visible World, and
setteth a new Form upon every thing: so the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> as a Seal by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of his <hi>Person</hi> with every Creature imprinteth the figure of himself in a
beautiful Form upon it.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>it is turned, as a Clay to the Seal. Job</hi> addeth; <hi>they stand, as a Garment.</hi>
The Creation is spoken of first <hi>Collectively, It;</hi> then all the Creatures <hi>in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
distributively, They.</hi> There are two rich Glypmses given us of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>Person</hi> of our Lord in the Creation by these words.</p>
               <p>1. As the whole Creation in <hi>general,</hi> so each in <hi>particular</hi> is sealed with the
<hi>entire Person</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. All the Creatures are <hi>Sealed</hi> with the <hi>Person of the Lord Jesus without,</hi>
and <hi>filled</hi> with the <hi>same Person within.</hi> Every Creature rightly seen, is as a <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Light</hi> cloathing the Body of the Sun, the <hi>Person of Christ;</hi> and
wrought in every part of it with the <hi>Figure</hi> of this <hi>Spiritual Sun.</hi> The <hi>Type</hi>
of it was the <hi>Vail</hi> before the <hi>most Holy Place.</hi> Within were the <hi>Cheru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ims</hi> of
Massy Gold. Upon the Vail was wrought the <hi>Similitude</hi> of the same <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims</hi>
in all manner of rich Colours.</p>
               <p>Thus the Earth is turned to <hi>Christ,</hi> as a <hi>Clay</hi> to the <hi>Seal;</hi> and every thing in
it standeth, as a <hi>Garment</hi> upon him.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he who peruseth this place in <hi>Job</hi> will find reason to believe, that
the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> pointeth at <hi>Three States.</hi> 1. The <hi>Creation,</hi> as the <hi>Figure.</hi> 2. The
<hi>Person of Christ</hi> incarnate, as the <hi>First-fruits.</hi> 3. The <hi>Reformation,</hi> as the <hi>Life</hi>
in the <hi>full Harvest.</hi> Neither will it seem unlikely to those who compare the
<hi>Scriptures;</hi> that <hi>Zacharias</hi> alludeth to <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> here to the <hi>first of Genesis.</hi>
In <hi>three</hi> things all agree; 1. a <hi>Darkness.</hi> 2. A <hi>Light</hi> rising in this Darkness, and
triumphing over it. 3. A <hi>New Form,</hi> given to all things by this Light.</p>
               <p>But to return; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. Our Lord is said to be, <hi>The express Image of his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49838:132"/>
Fathers Substance.</hi> The <hi>word</hi> is <hi>Character,</hi> which signifieth <hi>an Ingraving,</hi> as
upon a <hi>Seal.</hi> Great Persons first engrave their Arms upon some precious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as Gold, or a rich stone. This is their Seal. With this they stamp the
same Image upon several pieces of Wax, as they have occasion. So God the
Father setteth deeply, and richly, the compleat Form of his <hi>Divine Person,</hi> and
<hi>Substance</hi> upon the <hi>Person of his Son.</hi> Then he setteth him, as a Gold-Seal upon
the Creation, as Virgin Wax, and so imprinteth all his Beauties upon it. But
the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> stampeth one part of the Creation with the Impressions of
his Person thorow another; so that the Figure is more clear and perfect in the
invisible part of things upon Angels, and Spirits; more obscure, and imperfect
upon the Visible part, the Things of Sense.</p>
               <p>Before I leave this we are to take notice that the <hi>matter</hi> of the Creation,
which <hi>Job</hi> calleth <hi>Clay,</hi> is expressed by <hi>Water</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Genesis.</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
you set a seal upon water, it receiveth the Impression without resistance, but
keepeth it only by the continuance of the Seal itself upon it. Thus the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Creature to the end, is the same thing with the Creation of it
at first, it is the Impression and Figure of our Saviours Beautiful, and Blessed
Person, which is the Essence, and Form of each Created Being. It is this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Person itself, the Fountain of all Forms fixed in the Impression, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
every moment preserveth each Essence, and all Beings, by renewing them.
If the Seal be taken off, immediately the Figure vanisheth, and is no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Use.</hi> 1. Let all this, that hath been spoken of the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> perswade
us to study <hi>this Person,</hi> in which such unsearchable riches are laid up, and to
seek the knowledge of him. Beautiful things alone are worthy of knowledge.
This <hi>Jesus</hi> then is worthy of our knowledge. For he is fair. He is fairer than
all things; and so most worthy to be known; all Beauties are comprehended in,
and derived from him. <hi>His Person</hi> then should be the Center, where all the
lines of our knowledge meet, and from whence they are drawn.</p>
               <p>I shall press upon you the Study of your Beloved in the simplicity and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness
of his <hi>Heavenly Person</hi> by <hi>Two Arguments. 1. The Easiness. 2. The
Excellency.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>The knowledge of Jesus Christ is Easy.</hi> Heb. 5. 11. The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>
had made mention of <hi>Melchisedech</hi> in the <hi>verse</hi> before. In this he addeth:
<hi>Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered by reason of the
dulness of your hearing. Melchisedech</hi> signifieth <hi>the King of Righteousness.</hi> This
is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in that Spiritual Form of Divine Glory, which is the Throne
of Righteousness. In this he was eternally with the Father, in his heart, and
Eye. In this he was with the Saints from the beginning of the World, the
Immortal Seed in their Hearts, the Joyful, and Glorious Object in the Eye of
their Faith. In this he appeared frequently to them thorow outward Figures.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> telleth the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that He hath <hi>many things</hi> to say to them
<hi>of this Person.</hi> He hath many, innumerable Beauties in Him to unvail, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:49838:133"/>
shew to them. He hath many things to say, many words, and expressions, to
declare the riches of each single, Beauty. When <hi>David</hi> saw this <hi>Person of Christ,</hi>
as a City compact in it self, where all Spiritual Beauties, and Beautiful Spirits
dwelt together in a most Beautiful Order in the unity of this First and Great
Spirit, in the Eternal Palace of His Spiritual Form, he cryed out: <hi>Glorious
things are sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ken of thee, O thou City of God! Psal.</hi> 87. 3. So saith the <hi>Spirit</hi>
here: <hi>of whom I have many things to Say;</hi> Then He addeth; <hi>and hard to be
uttered.</hi> This seemeth a strange Testimony to bring, to prove the Knowledge
of <hi>Christ</hi> to be easy, which saith plainly; the things of <hi>Christ</hi> are <hi>hard to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi>
But you will presently see these words to have in them a full, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
proof of this, which we intend.</p>
               <p>The Beauties of <hi>Christ</hi> are hard to be uttered. Whence ariseth this Difficulty?
From the Nature of the Things? <hi>St. Paul</hi> teacheth us, that <hi>Every thing, which
maketh manifest, is Light; Eph.</hi> 5. 13. If that which maketh every thing
manifest, be Light; then is the Light itself most manifest of all things; then
the higher, and greater the Light; the clearer, the fuller is it in the Manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Itself, and of all other things. The <hi>Person of Christ</hi> is the most pure,
most perfect, and most universal Light. Nothing shineth so openly, so clearly
in every creature, in every place, in every Spirit; Nothing so easy to be seen,
as the <hi>Person</hi> of this Lovely One. Whence then is the difficulty of uttering His
Glories? The <hi>Spirit</hi> answereth the Question. It is from <hi>the Dulness of our Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
How evident an Argument is this of the Presence of our Beloved with us,
that He is before our Eyes in every Appearance of Things, that He is in the
midst of us? How plain a Testimony is it of the openness, and clearness of
His Beauties, of their nearness, and suitableness to our senses; that it is a <hi>Dulness</hi>
in us not to see this Person, these Beauties? We never account it to be a <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of Sense not to discern things Distant, or Difficult.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, Prov. 14. 6. <hi>Knowledge is easy to him that understandeth.</hi>
The <hi>Knowledge,</hi> which this Divine King had his eye upon thorow his whole
Book, was that <hi>Wisdom,</hi> which is the <hi>Brightness of the Glory</hi> of God shining
forth in the Soul. The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> seemeth thorow this book of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> to
express by <hi>understanding</hi> a Divine Light and Sense, which is the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>Christ</hi> in us; by <hi>Wisdom,</hi> that <hi>Divine Object,</hi> which is the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in us, like the Sun in his proper Sphere. This Earth which we tread upon,
This Heaven, which we see shining round about us, are not so manifest to our
natural Senses; as <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that <hi>Power</hi> of God, which bringeth forth, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up us and all things; that Wisdom of God, which encompasseth us round
about with its various brightnesses and beauties is present, open, and evident to
the Spiritual Eye.</p>
               <p>Doth not this move us; to understand, that there is an <hi>Heavenly Person</hi> ever
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h us, in whom are set before us all the Delights of our Eyes, all the Desires
of our Hearts; and that the only Bar between us, and these Beauties, these
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:49838:133"/>
Blessednesses is either our want of Senses, or the Dulness of our Senses, that
we discern them not? <hi>Mat. 10. 51. Bartimeus</hi> the blind beggar, hearing that
<hi>Jesus</hi> passed by, cryeth out; <hi>Jesus thou Son of David have mercy on me.</hi> He cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to cry, till the Lord maketh a stand, and asketh him; what he would
have. He answereth; <hi>Lord, that I may receive my sight. Isa.</hi> 50. 4. The Prophet
saith of God: <hi>He waketh mine Ear morning by morning: he wakeneth mine
Ear to hear, as the Learned.</hi> You that are no Christians indeed, who have no
Spiritual Senses, cease not crying, <hi>Jesus, thou Brightness of the Father's Glory,
have mercy on me, that I may receive my sight.</hi> You that are in truth Christians,
and have Spiritual Senses drowsie, and dull, whose heart is awake in you, while
you sleep, cry to the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> to awaken your Eye, and your Ears morning
by morning, moment by moment that you may see his Shape, and hear his
voice. This is the <hi>first Argument</hi> to press you to the study of the <hi>Person of
Christ;</hi> the <hi>Easiness</hi> of this <hi>knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>The</hi> Second Argument is the Excellency, <hi>which consisteth of</hi> two Parts,
<hi>the</hi> Comprehensiveness; <hi>the</hi> Efficacy <hi>of this</hi> knowledge.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Comprehensiveness</hi> of the knowledge of <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Excellency</hi> of
it, <hi>Col. 2. 2. All treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge are hid in him.</hi> Several
Propositions of great value and vertue, lie wrapt up in this single Proposition.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>All Things, that are to be known, lie together in the Heavenly Form of Jesus
Christ.</hi> All things are here in their first, and proper Being, in their Truth and
Substance, in their immutable essences, as they are capable of being known.
Every thing as it is seen without this Circle of Divine Light the Person of
<hi>Christ,</hi> is a Shadow, an Apparition, a Mockshow of itself. It may beget a
Fancy, or Opinion in our Souls, but no Knowledge.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That Light, in which alone things are known, is only in Christ.</hi> He is the
true, Supream, and universal Light. <hi>All things are naked, and manifest before
him: Heb.</hi> 4. 13. This is that Divine Light, in which every thing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in its Divine Form, in its naked Substance, and Essence, uncloathed of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Disguise, and Vail, as it lieth in the Divine Understanding, which is the
measure of all Truth. Therefore our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12.
where all things are said to be naked and manifest before him, is in the <hi>verse</hi>
before called; the <hi>Word of God; the living Word;</hi> the living Word of the
Divine understanding, in which it bringeth forth at once, and eternally all

               <p>3. The <hi>Eye, which taketh in all Knowledge is in Christ;</hi> As the <hi>Spirit</hi> of this

is a Saint <hi>Light in Christ;</hi> a Child of Light in this great <hi>Father of Lights. Jesus
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49838:134"/>
Christ</hi> in His Divine Form is the <hi>Light of Life; that is.</hi> 1. The <hi>First Light,</hi> as the
first Picture is called <hi>the Life.</hi> 2. The <hi>True Light;</hi> every other Light is a Pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
of Light, and no more. 3. <hi>A living Light;</hi> and so both a <hi>Fountain,</hi> and
an <hi>Eye.</hi> In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> the same word for the substance signifieth both. A Saint
Springing up in his inward man out of this Spiritual Form of <hi>Christ,</hi> and stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in it, is made itself also, <hi>a Fountain of living waters flowing from Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non;</hi>
of all living Glories flowing from the high, and flourishing Mountain of
the God-Head in the <hi>Person of Christ: Can.</hi> 4. 15. He is made also an <hi>Eye
set fully, Can. 5. 12. Aben Ezra</hi> in his notes expounded that to be <hi>an Eye,</hi>
in which is set the <hi>full Image</hi> of the whole Nature of things; in which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the language of the Gospel is set the Person of its Beloved, that
entire Image of the God-Head, and of both worlds, where all Fulness dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
together in a Divine Form, and Glory. This is spoken of Christ first, then
is true of a Saint, as a Saint is the Image of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>All Things, as they are known in Christ, are a Treasure. That which is born
of the Spirit, is spirit; John</hi> 3. 6. That which is seen in this Spirit of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
and Glory is an Immortal, and Glorious Spirit. This is the true mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying,
magnifying, and glorifying Glass. Each Dust is here known in the
bright Form of a Beautiful Star; each Star is discovered here to be an Heaven
of Stars, a new world of Glories. Every thing as it appeareth in <hi>Christ,</hi> is
something <hi>of Christ. Christ altogether is Lovely; Can.</hi> 5. 16. It is in the
Original; <hi>Every thing of him is desirablenesses.</hi> The least Point, that a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Eye can touch upon in the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> is a fresh spring, a full Sea, a
great, and bottomless deep of all Beauties, Excellencies, and Joys that may
render any thing perfectly, universally desirable.</p>
               <p>5. The <hi>Knowledge of things in Christ is a Treasure.</hi> It is <hi>Wisdom,</hi> as well as
<hi>Knowledge.</hi> It is a knowledge of things <hi>in their Head,</hi> in their highest Beauty,
Life, and Truth. It is a <hi>Fulness of Things.</hi> It is a <hi>Transforming Knowledge.</hi> We
are changed into the things themselves, and they into us. By knowing we
possess, and enjoy them; we are possessed, and enjoyed by them; we stand
both in one Image, and Spirit mutually comprehending, and comprehended;
mutually cloathing, and cloathed.</p>
               <p>All this Treasure is hid in <hi>Christ,</hi> not as in a <hi>Cloud,</hi> but as in the <hi>Sun;</hi> by no
darkness, or obscurity there; but by the Excess, and Transcendency of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
by the Perfection, and Purity of the Light; as <hi>Christ is hid in</hi> God;
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. This hiding maketh the Object more a Treasure, and more evident
to a suitable Eye, in as much, at it is a Divine Form in a Divine Light; a
Form of Light dwelling in the Fountain of Light. How worthy is this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that Zeal to it, and pursuit of it, which the wise King stirreth us up
to, <hi>Prov. 2. 3, 4, 5. to cry for it,</hi> to the Fountain of wisdom above, with
the voice of our Faith; <hi>to seek it as Silver</hi> in every thing round about us, the
pure mettal in the oar of the Creature, by the Flame of our Love; <hi>to dig for</hi>

it, <hi>as hidden Treasures</hi> within our selves, below the Foundations of this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by Humility and the Cross?</p>
               <l>
                  <hi>This is the</hi> Comprehensiveness of the Knowledge of our Saviour.</l>
               <p>2. <hi>The</hi> Second Excellency in this Knowledge is the Efficacy. <hi>This divideth
itself into</hi> three Branches: It worketh Grace. 1. Universally. 2. Powerfully.
3. Kindly.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Knowledge of the Lord Jesus worketh Grace Universally.</hi> It worketh
all Grace together in a sweet Harmony. <hi>John</hi> 17. 3. In a bosom-discourse
between himself, and his Father, where he is most naked, sweet, and free, the
Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> saith to his Father; <hi>This is Eternal Life to know thee the only true
God, and Him whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ,</hi> God is True, the Truth,
as he is God. He is the True God, as he is the Onely One. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is sent forth
from him, as he is the Brightness, the Effulgency, the Outshining of his Glory; his
essential Image. Thus is he also one with him. The Father cannot be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known by him, if he be not perfectly one with him. This verse hath in it
a figure called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: One thing expressed, as two; like that; a Cup, and
Gold, for a Golden Cup. So here; to know <hi>the only true God, and Jesus Christ</hi>
sent forth from him, is to know that God, who is the Unity, and Truth in
<hi>Jesus</hi> his essential Image, in which he comprehendeth, and cometh forth into
all manner of various Images; the outgoing of his Divine Essence in Eternity
and Time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is the whole Work of God upon the Souls of the Elect from the
Beginning to the End; the Divine Life begun in Grace on Earth, compleated
in Glory in Heaven. I have formerly said, that Knowledge maketh the Spirit
One with that which is Known. How should this endear the Knowledge of
our Blessed Lord, and quicken us to follow hard after it; The true Knowledge
of our Beloved maketh us One Spirit with Him, and transformeth us into His
Image, which is the whole Armour of God put on at once; the compleat frame
and fabrick of all Grace rising up at once in the Heart? All Graces are One
in the Person of <hi>Christ.</hi> By taking him in, and being made One with Him, we
take in All Grace, and are molded into All Grace in One, according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Revelation of our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in us. The want of having this Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
upon the Mount, <hi>Jesus</hi> in His Heavenly Form in the Eye of <hi>our</hi> Spirits, is
the great reason why the Tabernacle of God goeth up so imperfectly, and
brokenly in us. One Saint is careful of his way, but go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but careless. One is sweet and slight, another serious and soure, censorious.
One is zealous and ignorant; another high in his Light, and loose in his Life.
Particular rules and precepts, are like a Watering-pot, which a man carrieth
up and down in his hand, watering his flowers and plants singly and slightly.
While one is watered the other withereth. The Discovery of our Saviour in His
Spiritual Person to the Eye o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which at once watereth thy whole Garden, and descendeth to the Root of

every Truth, Grace, and comfort in thee. <hi>Grow,</hi> saith <hi>St. Peter, in Grace, and
in the Knowledge of Jesus Christ. 2 Pet.</hi> l. l. Grace indifferently, universally
in the whole Nature, and Kind is inseparable from the Knowledge of <hi>Jesus
Christ.</hi> These two mutually breed, and feed each other. All Grace in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Frame and Harmony is the similitude, the Image of <hi>Christs Person,</hi> as it is
in Glory, formed in us. As <hi>Christ</hi> riseth and shineth forth upon us, this Image
springeth up, groweth clearer and fairer. As this Image cometh to perfection;
so <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is seen more perfectly in it, as in a Glass. If you be compleat
Christians, grow at once proportionably in all Grace, in Light, in Life, in
Love; study the Heavenly Person of your Bridegroom, grow in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him. As the Eye of the Husband should be the Looking-glass of the
Wife, by which she adorneth her self: so let this glorious Person of thy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
be that Spiritual Glass, in which thou O Queen, O Believing, and loving
Soul, dressest thy self.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The Knowledge of our Lord Jesus worketh Grace powerfully.</hi> Psal. 19. 5.
<hi>The Sun cometh forth like a Bridegroom out of his Chamber, and a strong man to
run a race. His going forth is from the end of Heaven to the end thereof, nothing
can hide it from his Heat.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> testifieth to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 18. that the
Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is the subject of the Spirit in this <hi>Psalm.</hi> When he cometh forth
from the Chamber of Invisible, and Spiritual Glories in his Resurrection: He
cometh into the Soul at once; as a Sun for Light, and Glory; as a Bridegroom
for Love, and Beauty; as a strong man for Life, Power, and Progress. When
he riseth, and shineth out in us, he encompasseth our whole Person, and Life
from one end to the other; he searcheth out every corner in both. There is
nothing so close, so dark, so corrupt, so hard, so unclean, so dead, so comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
that can hide itself from the convincing, enlightning, consuming, soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
cleansing, quickning, comforting heat, and power of his Appearance.</p>
               <p>Every Beam of the Sun is a Figure of the Sun, sheweth the Sun itself, and
carrieth along with it three Things, Light, Heat, and Influence or Vertue.
Such is every Spiritual Truth in the Soul. It is a Beam from the <hi>Person of
Christ.</hi> It beareth a Figure of his Person, and setteth his Person open, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
like a clear Sun before the Soul, drawing the Eye of the Spirit to that,
and terminating it alone upon that. Each Spiritual Beam, each Glance, every
Discovery of <hi>Christ</hi> bringeth with it into the Soul, a Light of Knowledge; a
Heat of Love; a Convincing, Converting, Melting, Transforming, Chearing,
Sanctifying, Spiritualizing, Glorifying Influence, and Power. Go then in all
thy pantings, in all thy Prayers by night, and by day cry to this Blessed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
<hi>Arise O Sun; shine O Light that my Soul may become a Spiritual Garden;
that my Garden may flourish with all Spiritual Plants of Truth, Grace, and Joy;
that all my Spiritual</hi> Plants may give forth their smell, and vertue by thine
Appearance.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The Knowledge of Christ worketh all Grace, and maketh it most kindly.</hi>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:49838:135"/>
Psal. 110. 3. The <hi>Spirit</hi> saith to <hi>Christ; in the day of thy power thy people
shall be a willing people, in the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the Morning,
the Dew of thy Youth.</hi> The word <hi>Power</hi> signifieth also <hi>Armies. Willing</hi> hath a
twofold sense; <hi>a natural, pleasant Freedom;</hi> and <hi>a Princeliness.</hi> The <hi>Morning</hi>
is the <hi>Person of Christ</hi> in the Glory of the Spirit, who is called in Scripture the
<hi>Day-spring,</hi> the <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Sun-rising.</hi> When this lovely morning breaketh upon
thy Spirit from the midst of the shades of unbelief, and thy natural State, it
maketh a <hi>day of Power, a day of Armies. Jesus Christ</hi> appeareth now in the
Glory of his Father, in his own Glory, in the Glory of all his holy Angels. He
boweth down all these Heavens, and with them descendeth from above into
thy Spirit. With these Armies of Glories he fighteth against all the Powers of
Darkness in thee. With the Power of these Glories he subdueth thee to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
winneth thy Love, transformeth thy Spirit and Person; shineth upon, and
draweth forth to maturity every Seed of Glory in thee.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Person</hi> of thy <hi>Jesus</hi> shining out in thee is that <hi>Morning,</hi> from which, as
from a Beautiful, and Blessed <hi>Womb,</hi> falleth the <hi>Dew of Christs Youth,</hi> which is
his Spirituality, his Eternity ever-full, ever-flourishing with all Divine Beauties
upon his Person. This <hi>Dew</hi> maketh all Graces to spring in thy Soul; power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
plentifully; beautifully; pleasantly; with State and Majesty. As that
Vine, which hath most of the Sun, bringeth the most kindly Grapes; the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Clusters; the fairest, and best coloured; the sweetest, the largest Grapes;
the most abounding with Spirit and Heat yielding the best Wine: so doth that
Soul, which liveth most in the Eye of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> under the Beams of his
Person unvailed, bring forth the most kindly Fruits of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in all these
respects. 1. All Grace aboundeth most; it is as the Dew. 2. It is pleasantest.
<hi>Thy people are a willing people.</hi> There is most of Love, of Life, and Delight.
3. It is most Beautiful. There are <hi>the Beauties of</hi> Holiness. 4. Every Grace

                  <hi>Use 2. A Direction</hi> to the Knowledge of the Person of our Saviour, and
his Beauties. The Lord himself saith, <hi>The words that I speak unto you, they are
Spirit, and they are Life; John 6. 63. Jesus</hi> had been speaking of <hi>Himself,</hi> of
<hi>eating his Flesh,</hi> and <hi>drinking his Blood.</hi> He meaneth by <hi>words,</hi> the <hi>Things,</hi> which
those words signify. The <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> the excellencies, and vertues of his
Person, concerning which he spake to them, are not <hi>Flesh, and Blood,</hi> which
are the Shadows only, dying, dead, yea <hi>Death</hi> itself; nor meerly Spiritual; but
<hi>Spirit Substantially,</hi> and <hi>Essentially,</hi> which is <hi>Life</hi> not by <hi>Participation,</hi> but <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi>
in the Essence, in the Spring.</p>
               <p>This is the ground, which I lay for the direction, which I am to give you in
your study of the Beautiful Person of <hi>Christ; Christ and his Beauties are
Spiritual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now not I, but <hi>St. Paul</hi> giveth you <hi>two Rules, 1 Corin.</hi> 2. 7, 8. The <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Apostle</hi> speaketh of the Knowledge of <hi>the Wisdom of God in a Mystery.</hi>
Then he expresseth this <hi>Wisdom of God in a Mystery</hi> to be <hi>Jesus Christ, the Lord
of Glory;</hi> the <hi>Lord,</hi> whose Person is all Glory, whose Principality, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
is Glory in the Abstract, Glory in its utmost extent. He had said, this was
unknown to all the <hi>Princes of this world,</hi> the Princes in Wisdom, as well as
Power, the highest ranks, and orders of Men or Angels. To confirm this he
citeth a <hi>Scripture</hi> in the <hi>next verse. v. 9. Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard,
neither have entered into the heart of Man, the things which God hath prepared
for them that love him.</hi> Observe by laying these <hi>three verses</hi> together, how <hi>St.
Paul</hi> meaneth one Thing by these three expressions; <hi>The Wisdom of God in a
Mystery; the Lord of Glory; Things prepared by God for those that love him.</hi> The
<hi>Person of Christ</hi> is that Image of Glory, and of the God-Head, in which lieth
the entire Mystery, Wisdom, and design of God from the Beginning to the
End, with all its way. He is a Collection of all those Beauties, and Blessedness;
Loves, and Joys prepared by the Father for his Beloved Ones to feast upon to
Eternity. Of these <hi>St. Paul</hi> determineth; that the noblest, highest, largest
senses, understandings, hearts of the most excellent Creatures are uncapable of
the least Glympse, or tast of them. This he draweth down afterwards to a
Rule, which is my <hi>first Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rule</hi> 1. Spiritual Things are Spiritually discerned, 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>This Rule
divideth it self into</hi> Three Branches.</p>
               <p>1. Spiritual things are discerned by a Spiritual Eye. <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>saith</hi> The natural
man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness to him;
neither can he; for they are Spiritually discerned, 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>Nature hath a</hi>
Twofold Eye, <hi>the</hi> Eye of Sense, <hi>the</hi> Eye of Reason.</p>
               <p>The Eye of <hi>Sense</hi> is common to Man with Beasts, and is the <hi>Bestial Eye.</hi> This
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:49838:136"/>
discerneth the Beauties of Flesh and Blood. We have histories of Beasts, Birds
and Fishes, which have been in love with Beautiful Virgins and Youths. But
this Eye is blind to Spiritual Objects. A Material and Corporeal Object, if it
excel, and be transcendent in Sweetness, Harmony, or Beauty, destroyeth the
Sense, as the Sun dazleth, darkeneth, and putteth out the Eye. How much
more unable are our Senses, to take in, or bear Immaterial and Spiritual Glories?</p>
               <p>Nature's other Eye is that of <hi>Reason,</hi> of the Mind, the Intellectual Eye, which
is common to Man with Angels, This is the Angelical Eye in Man. This can
discover, can take some measure of the Invisible things of the Creation, and
maintain some Commerce with Angels. But the Darkness of this Eye to the
Beauties of <hi>Christ</hi> is painted forth in a lively manner by that sweet and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
Prophet <hi>Isaiah, c.</hi> 6. v. 1. <hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> appeareth sitting upon the Throne
of His Spiritual and Divine Form; His Train of Glories filled the Temple,
<hi>v.</hi> 2. The <hi>Seraphims</hi> themselves, which are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eputed the Highest Order and
Degree of Angels, cover their faces with two of their Wings, as uncapable of
the Brightness of this Blessed Appearance.</p>
               <p>We generally profess to abhor the Principles of <hi>Sadducees</hi> and <hi>Socinians. O</hi>
that we did not most of us fall in too far with them in the real and practical
part! The <hi>Sadducees</hi> deny both <hi>Angel and Spirit.</hi> They allow nothing besides
that which their Senses can take hold of and assure to them. Let us awaken
our own Souls, and examine our selves. Are we not very apt to reject and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> Himself, if He come in any Appearance of Beauty, and
Glory, which beareth not the Figure of, which hath not some proportion to
the Forms of Flesh and Sense?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Socinians</hi> acknowledge both Angels, Created Spirits, and the Eternal
uncreated Spirit above them. But they admit nothing more of these, than their
reason can give reception to. They ascend no higher to these, than the Wing,
of their Natural understanding can carry them. They make reason the only
Rule, and Judge of Divine Things. The men of <hi>Sodom</hi> went about groping
for the door, at which the Angels went in, and could not find it; because they
were blind. Is not this too frequently our case? How many? How often do
we all go about in our searches, groping for that Gate of Heaven, by which
the Angels, all Divine Appearances go in and out at the Heavenly Person of
our Saviour; but find him not; because we seek him with those natural Eyes of
our own sense, and understanding, which are perfectly blind to his Beauties?</p>
               <p>Divines teach us, that one way of knowing God is by <hi>Negations;</hi> when we
run over each particular good in every Creature; when we lay all the good of
the whole Creation together in one heap and then say; nothing of this is God;
all this is nothing of God, as he is in himself; his Nature, and Person is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beyond, and above all that is here. We were advanced to a good degree in
the Knowledge of our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> if we were arrived at this <hi>Negative</hi> way
of knowing him; if when we were gone as f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49838:137"/>
our inward faculties could enlarge, and lift up themselves; we then said of
all; <hi>this is not Jesus Christ.</hi> No, he is made higher than all the Heavens of sense,
than all the Heavens of Reason, and of Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When we are thus stopt, and bounded, let us turn to Prayer, and wait for the
opening of a</hi> New Eye <hi>in us.</hi> David <hi>cryeth out,</hi> Psal. 24. 7. Lift up your heads,
O ye gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting Doors, and the King of Glory shall come
in. <hi>So do you cry;</hi> Thou everlasting Door, thou Eye of Eternity, thou Spiritual, and
Divine Eye, open thy self in me; that by thee the King of Glory may come in to me,
and fill all my Soul, and Senses themselves with His Train. So shall I see my King
in His Beauty.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Spiritual things are discerned in a Spiritual Light, 1 Job. 1. 7. If we walk
in the Light, as He is in the Light, we have fellowship one with another, and the
blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin. As He is in the Light: He</hi>
is God the Father, as is manifest by that part of the <hi>last clause</hi> in the <hi>verse, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ His Son.</hi> That term, <hi>As,</hi> is Emphatical, and Distinguishing. There
is a <hi>Twofold Light; One</hi> in which the Creature is; <hi>Another,</hi> in which God is.
<hi>One</hi> God <hi>maketh;</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> God <hi>is.</hi> The Creature is in a Derived, and Change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Light like the Earth. God is, like the Sun in His own Light, inseparable
from Himself. <hi>St Paul</hi> distinguisheth between these two Lights; <hi>God who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Light to shine out of darkeness, hath shined in our hearts the Light of
the Knowledge of the glory of God in the face or Person of Jesus Christ, 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 6.
Behold here <hi>One Light</hi> which is commanded, by the Creating Word of God,
out of Darkness, which is called up out of the Possibility, and Principles of the
Creature; <hi>Another Light,</hi> which is the immediate <hi>Shine</hi> of the God-Head itself
in the Face of <hi>Christ.</hi> As the Sunshine is called the Flower of Light, because it
springeth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lourisheth in the Body and Face of the Sun itself; so is this
called here a Light of Glory in the Face of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God Himself is called <hi>the Father of Lights, Jam.</hi> 1. 17, that is, the Eternal
Sun; the Sun of Spirits; the Supreme Sun of all Beings, Spiritual and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real.
He is the Fountain of Light, the first, and purest Light; His Essence is a
Light of Glory. This Essential Light of his own unchangeable Glories is the
Heaven, in which he is. <hi>St. Paul</hi> saith of him; <hi>he only hath immortality dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the Light, which no man can approach unto, whom no man hath seen, nor
can see, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 16. The Light of God is so pure, that it is invisible to
every Creature. It shineth with such a Strength, and Fulness of Glory, that
no mortal Eye, the natural sight of no Man, or Angel, can approach it, or
pierce into it. In this God himself dwelleth, as in a Palace composed of the
Beams, and Brightnesses of his own God-Head spread round about him, and
encompassing him on every side. In this Palace he resideth in the Center, and
midst of every Spirit, every Being, hid from the search of all. In this high,
and strong Tower of Divine Light <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> dwelleth together with the
<hi>Father,</hi> and is hid there after the same manner; <hi>Colos. 3. 3. Our Life is hid
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49838:137"/>
with Christ in God.</hi> He is hid in God by the excess of Light, in an Abyss of
Glory.</p>
               <p>But how then shall we see <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in his own Light, if that Light of
his Person, and Beauties by its unsearchable Riches, and Incomprehensible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approachable
Glories hide him from us? <hi>St. Peter</hi> answereth this objection;
1 <hi>Pet. 2. 9. Ye are a chosen Generation, a Royal Priesthood, a peculiar people,
that ye should shew forth the praises of him, who hath called us out of Darkness
into his marvellous Light. His Light</hi> in Greek is properly <hi>his own Light.</hi> Every
Light in the things of sense is from the Sun. But that is the Suns own Light,
which is inherent in the Body of the Sun, which floweth immediately from it,
in which the Sun himself is seen. In like manner that is Gods own Light by
way of eminency, peculiarity, and distinction from every other Light; which
is the very shine, and sparkling of the God-Head in itself, upon itself; in which
it seeth, and rejoyceth in it self; in which alone it is seen; which is inseparable
from the Divine essence, and Persons, as the Sun-shine is from the glorious body
of the Sun.</p>
               <p>This is a <hi>Marvellous Light.</hi> This Light itself is a Divine Wonder. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the reach of every Humane, or Angelical understanding. It is a Light,
which openeth a Divine World of Glorious Wonders; every thing is then only
seen right, and in its true state, when it is seen in this Light. Every thing seen
in this Light is a Divine Wonder; a Divine Mystery, Incomprehensible, for
the greatness of the Glory, to sense and reason; but familiar, and plain to the
Spiritual Eye, as bred up with it, and continually before it, known to it from
the Beginning. The Spiritual Bride meeteth her beloved here with all his
Beauties in this Light, and kisseth him, as her Brother, as born of the same
Mother. There is no strangeness between them.</p>
               <p>This Light is indeed the Temple, the Palace of the God-Head, of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> are here upon the Throne of their Kingdom, in
the Glory of their Divine Nature. But a Saint is a Royal Priesthood; a King,
and a Priest. So he is taken in, called by God into this Sacred Palace, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
to behold the Beauties, to contemplate the vertues of both, the <hi>Father,</hi>
and the <hi>Son,</hi> that they may declare them by the Divine Power of their words,
and the Beauty of Holiness, which is the Sun-shine of the Divine Nature in
their Lives.</p>
               <p>We are now by this Circuit of <hi>Scriptures</hi> brought back to that <hi>First,</hi> on
which we grounded this <hi>Second Branch</hi> of our <hi>Rule,</hi> and for the explication
of which we have taken this compass. <hi>If we walk in the Light, as he is in the
Light, we have Fellowship one with another, and the Blood of Jesus Christ his
Son cleanseth us from all Sin.</hi> Who are these, that have Fellowship <hi>one with
another. St. John</hi> had said before: <hi>These things we write, that you may have

the Body of the Sun itself, if we will see the Sun in his true, and proper Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
Some speak of a Blessed world in the Sun, the Rarities, and Beauties of
which are seen only by the Inhabitants of the Sun. Gods own Light is a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
World, in which the Father, the Son, all the Saints dwell together eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,
have their proper life of Divine Sweetness, and Blessedness, appear in
their proper Forms of Divine Purity, and Beauty. If ye will be admitted into
this Society, to a sight of these; you must go beyond, you must come within
every Light of the Creature, all Beams into the Bosom of God himself, into
the Brightness of the Divine Essence, which is the <hi>Living-looking-Glass of the
Holy Trinity.</hi> Here you shall see your <hi>Jesus,</hi> as he is. You shall see him, as you
are seen by him.</p>
               <p>For now <hi>the Blood of Christ cleanseth you from all Sin.</hi> This Light of the
Divine Nature which is the Light of Life, and the Spirit Himself is the <hi>Blood
of Jesus</hi> eminently, in the vertue of it, as it is Incorruptible. This is that which
poureth forth itself thorow the Humane Nature into the lowest Forms of Dust,
Darkness, Wrath, and Death, in the place of Sinners, as a Ransom of Infinite
value. This is that Precious Blood of the true Vine, which when Justice and
Wrath have drunk of, they are satisfied, sweeetned, and changed into Grace and
Glory; an over-spreading Loveliness, and an overflowing Love. This is that
Blood, in which the Life is, which, as it is let forth in Death, wrappeth up all
things in it self, washeth them from filth, and flesh; then riseth up again as
high, as its own Spring in the Heart of the Father, and carrieth up all things
with it self into the Newness of the Glory of God.</p>
               <p>Nothing is so directly contrary to the Divine Light, as Sin. Therefore it is
expressed by Darkness, and the Night. As the Light of the Day cleanseth all
Forms of things from the Darkness of the Night which lay upon them; that
now they have fellowship one with another, mingle their Beams and Beauties
with mutual Joy: so doth this <hi>Blood of the Lamb,</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> shining in the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ,</hi> when it breaketh forth from the Shades of Death in the morning
of the Resurrection, sanctifie the Heavenly things themselves, bring forth from
under every cloud, stain, and dust, the <hi>Heavenly Persons</hi> of a <hi>Saint</hi> of <hi>Jesus
Christ,</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Heavenly Truths,</hi> and <hi>Lives</hi> of all Things; that they may
in the Unity of this Light maintain a precious commerce. and traffick of all
interchangeable Sweetnesses &amp; Excellencies with Immortality unto a full Joy.</p>
               <p>Psal. 4. 6. <hi>David thus openeth the Hearts, of the multitude, and his own
Heart;</hi> Many will say, Who will shew us any good? But Lord lift up tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

answer to God, and say,</hi> Lord, lift up thou the Light of thy face upon me. In the
Shinings of thy Face is my Iesus hid; and in these Shinings alone will He
be seen by me. <hi>Thus the Spiritual Beauties of</hi> Iesus Christ <hi>are to be discerned
only in the Spiritual Light of His own Person.</hi>

3. <hi>Spiritual Things are to be seen in Spiritual Forms.</hi> This is the <hi>Third Branch</hi>
of the <hi>Rule, Joh.</hi> 20. 30. When the Lord after his Resurrction had appeared
to the Apostles in a <hi>Body of Flesh,</hi> as He had been cruci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ied; the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>
addeth, <hi>And many other Signs did Jesus in the presence of His disciples.</hi> Observe
this expression well; His Appearance in a Natural Body, the same, in which
He had formerly lived with them, was not the <hi>Truth</hi> it Self, but a <hi>Sign</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luk. 24. 38. Jesus</hi> shewing Himself after the same manner to His Apostles,
raiseth them from their fears, that This was the Apparition of some Spirit, by
these, words: <hi>Behold my hands, and my feet, that it is I my self. A Spirit hath not
Flesh and Bones, as you see me to have.</hi> The Lord seemeth to speak to them after
this manner. <q>You have not yet received the Spirit; but are hitherto car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.
If I should shew my self to you, as I am now in the Glory of my Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
in which I am altogether Spiritual, and a Spirit; you would not
know me; you would not believe, that I were the same Person; you would
be afraid of me. I have therefore wrought this Miracle, and given you this
Sign in a tenderness towards you, and a Condescention to your present weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
By that Almighty Power over Heavenly and Earthly Things, which I
am now cloathed with; by the virtue of that Spiritual, Divine Form and
Substance, into which I am now raised, which comprehendeth within it self
all Form, Substances and Virtues; I present my self to you in that <hi>same Body,</hi>
composed of the <hi>same Flesh and Bones,</hi> in which I lived with you, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed
upon the Cross before your Eyes, with the <hi>same Wounds,</hi> which I then recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
And, because this is a Sign, therefore do I accompany it to your Senses,
and to your Spirits with a Double Evidence and Seal from my Divinity;
One, that this is no Imposture, or Apparition, with which Evil Spirits have
power to deceive your Sight, your Hearing, your Touch, all your natural
Faculties; but that Individual and Substantial Body of mine, as it was in
Flesh: the Other, the awakening of Spiritual Senses in you, the Shining
forth of my Glorified Body, and my Divinity by their own Light upon
these, thorow this Sign of my Natural Body reassumed for this Service. But
now beware that you make not this Sign a Stumbling-block to you, to make
you think me now like your selves, and such a one as formerly I was, to
have a body of an Earthly Substance, or Figure, consisting of Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>sh and
Bones. No, the Days of my Flesh are past. I was put to Death in my Flesh,
and to the Flesh, I am now quickened by the Spirit to live for ever in the
Spirit. A Spirit hath not Flesh nor Bones, as you see me now to have. </q> This
seemeth to be something of our Saviours sence in this place.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8. 6. saith, <hi>To be carnally-minded is Death; but to be spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded
is Life and Peace.</hi> The Greek word comprehendeth an Act of both
the Faculties of our Souls; our Understanding, and our Will. To look upon
things in their Fleshly Forms, to savour and rellish a Fleshly Sweetness in
things, is Death. To see things in their Spiritual Appearances, to savour and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49838:140"/>
rellish them in a Spiritual Sweetness; This is Life, and Peace, which is the
Harmony, the Musick, the Crown of Life. When the Disciples looked down
into the Grave, for <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the Angels reproved them saying, <hi>Why seek
ye the Living among the Dead? He is not here; He is risen; He is gone before
you into</hi> Galilee, <hi>as Himself spake unto you.</hi> The Flesh was our Saviour's Grave,
and is still the Grave of the Spirit. All Forms and Beauties of the Flesh are
Grave-cloaths bound about Him. Let us no more seek the Living and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Person of our Beloved, nor His Living and Immortal Beauties, which are
all <hi>Spirit and Life,</hi> among the Dead things of the Flesh. He is not here in
Flesh any more. He is risen, and gone before us into the Spirit. Let us follow
Him thither. I have done with the <hi>First Rule</hi> to direct us in the Knowledge
of the <hi>Person of Christ; Spiritual Things are to be discerned Spiritually.</hi>

lay this Groundwork for the Building, which I intend to raise upon this <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;</hi>
The set Design of the <hi>Apostle</hi> here, is to discourse of the Resurrection
of the <hi>Body.</hi> He therefore frameth this <hi>Question</hi> to himself, which containeth
the Great Subject of his whole Discourse in this place: <hi>How are the dead rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up, and with What Body do they come? v.</hi> 35. In <hi>answer</hi> to this question
he treateth of the Bodies of the Saints in general, of the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> in
particular, as the <hi>Root,</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of the Resurrection to all the rest.</p>
               <p>Upon this ground I shall raise <hi>three Propositions,</hi> as <hi>three Stories</hi> in my Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
which will take in the greatest part of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in this Scripture.</p>
               <p>Prop. 1. The Body of Christ risen from the Dead is not to be compared with
the Body of Christ living upon the Earth, or Dying. St. Paul <hi>likeneth by a large
similitude the</hi> living Body <hi>to a</hi> Seed, <hi>the</hi> Body raised <hi>to a</hi> perfect Plant <hi>sprung
up out of that Seed.</hi> v. 36. 37, 38. St. Paul <hi>maketh expresly</hi> three Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
               <p>1. The Life of the one is a Death compared to the life of the other; and
so the world, in which it is a Grave, to that Image of things in the Resurrection;
<hi>v. 36. That which thou sowest, is not quickned, except it die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. They differ as two several Bodies for Substance, and Shape. <hi>Thou sowest
not that Body, that shall be. v.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>3. One is as bare Grain, naked; dark, deformed, little, slight: the other
hath a Body, a Substantial, Beautiful, Distinct fulness, It hath a Form of Light
and Beauty; proportions of greatness, and magnitude; a fulness of Substance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It hath a Divine Body, a Body drawn forth from the Treasury of the God-Head;
<hi>God giveth it a Body. v.</hi> 38. It is a Body, a Form, and Fulness sprung
forth from the Divine Wisdom, and Will, bearing the Glorious stamp of these,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49838:140"/>
in which thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
himself pleaseth. v.</hi> 38. It is also to the Seed <hi>its own Body, and to every Seed
its own Body. v.</hi> 38. As <hi>John the Baptist</hi> saith of <hi>Jesus Christ; he is perfer'd
before me, because he was before me;</hi> as in the purity, and Paradise of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
the perfect Plants were first in the Fulness of their Beauty, and Fruit,
bearing their Seed in them: so in the Paradise of Eternity before the World,
which is <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God, the Immortal, the Glorious, the
Divine Bodies, and Forms of things were first, as the Flourishing Tree, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
in themselves the Bodies, and Forms of Flesh, as Shadows, or naked
Seeds, hid in the Light, or Bosom of the beautiful Substance, and Fruit. Then
came forth the Earthly Forms of things into the State of this Creation. These
are <hi>Shadows,</hi> under which the Divine Substances are vailed. These are <hi>Seeds,</hi>
in which the Tree itself lieth hid, as a <hi>Divine Mystery.</hi> By the breaking up
of these Shadows, and the dying of these Seeds, the Immortal Bodies, and
Glorious Substances themselves spring forth thorow them. So every Seed hath
its own Body in the Resurrection. 1. It is that Body of Glory, in which it
lay, and to which it relateth, as its Divine Original, or first Idea in the mind
and will of God. 2. It is that which lay hid virtually in it. 3. It is that,
which springeth up out of it, and changeth it into itself; Thus the Body
of our Lord risen, is the same Body in relation to the same Idea, or Pattern
in God; to the same Soul, to which it is joyned, as its proper Form in the
Person of <hi>Christ;</hi> to the same first Matter, out of which it is taken; <hi>God giveth
it a Body, as it hath pleased him, and to every Seed its own Body, v.</hi> 38. My
Brethren, what joy is it to think, that the Body of our loving, and beloved
<hi>Jesus;</hi> that our own Bodies; that the Bodies of our dearest Relations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
lose nothing of themselves in Death; yea are much more themselves by
Death in the Resurrection; as a man awake is much more himself, than in a
Dream; a King upon his Throne, than in the Grave, and Tomb? We shall
lose nothing of our selves, nor of our distinction.</p>
               <p>But I fear I go to far for common understandings to follow me. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conclude <hi>this Proposition</hi> with a plain representation of the Truth to you.</p>
               <p>As the thing figured, exceedeth the figure: so the difference between the
<hi>Body</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> before Death, and after it, is much more large than
that, which is between a single grain of Wheat cast into the Earth, and the
standing Corn upon the ground full-ripe with many perfect grains of Wheat
in the Ear; than that between the single Seed of a Rose, and a Rose-Tree full
of fresh, and flourishing Roses; or the Seed of an Apple, and a well-grown
Apple-Tree laden with ripe Apples.</p>
               <p>What Image could any man frame to himself, or what conjecture would
he make of a Rose-bush, or a Rose by the single Seed, if he had never seen
the things themselves? No more is it possible for us to take any measure of
the <hi>Body of Christ</hi> in Heaven, or at all to guess, what manner of things it should
be, by his Body on Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:49838:141"/>
1. <hi>John.</hi> 2. 3. we read from the mouth of the Beloved Disciple, who lay
in the Bosom of <hi>Christ,</hi> knew most of His Divine Secrets, and was best acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with His Person in Glory? that, <hi>now we are the Sons of God, but it doth not
appear, what we shall be: but, when he appeareth, we shall be like him, for we
shall see him as He is.</hi> Now we have the Seed of God in us: now we have in us
the Seed of a Divine and Glorious Soul, of a Divine and Glorious Body. But,
what this Seed, which is sown in our Earth, will be, when it is a Tree in the
Heavenly Paradise; what this Glorious Soul, and body will be, when they are
come forth, grown up; and perfected, we do not at all know, Only this aim
we have. We are sure, that we shall be capable of an immediate Sight, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of God, without any Vail, or Garment, without any Representation,
or Distance; <hi>as He is</hi> in His naked and simple Essence, in His own proper and
immutable Form. This is an infallible Argument; that then we shall <hi>be</hi> in the
Form of God. For otherwise it would be impossible for us to <hi>see it,</hi> and take it
in.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> illustrateth this difference between the Body of a Saint in its Life
on Earth, and in the Resurrection, by two Comparisons; the Varieties of <hi>Flesh</hi>
and of <hi>Bodies. All Flesh is not the same Flesh. There is one Flesh of Men, another
of beasts, another of fishes, another of birds, v. 39. There are Terrestrial Bodies,
and Caelestial; the Glory of the Terrestrial is One, the Glory of the Caelestial is
another. There is one Glory of the Sun, another of the Moon, another of the Stars;
one Star differeth from another in Glory: so also is the resurrection of the Dead.
v.</hi> 40. 41. 42. It is a very great mistake to think, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> intendeth
here to set forth the different Glories of Saints in Heaven. He hath a far higher,
and nobler design. This is his sence, and the force of his arguing: <q>You must
not think, because we have Bodies on Earth and Bodies in Heaven, that upon
this Ground these Bodies must be of the same Nature, and Kind, or at all like
one another. How vast a variety of Bodies do we behold with our Eyes on this
Earth, and in this Heaven? As great as the number of the Stars in the visible,
Heaven; so great, and incomprehensible is the Variety, and Several Sorts of
Bodies. For every one of these differeth from the other. Such, yea, far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
is the Difference between a Body, when it is sown in Death, and a Body,
when it is raised up. A Body raised, though be it still a Body doth more
vastly differ from it self here, than any two Bodies differ in the frame of
Nature, or within the Compass of the whole Creation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The properties of a Body in Heaven, by which it is distinguished from a
Body on Earth, are four as the <hi>Apostle</hi> reckoneth them up; <hi>Power; Glory;
Incorruptibility; Spirituality; v.</hi> 42. 43. The ground of these differences
he layeth in that Primary, and Radical One; <hi>It is sown a Natural Body; it is
raised a Spiritual Body; v.</hi> 44. The Sun doth not so much differ in <hi>matter,</hi>
and <hi>make,</hi> from a Clod of Earth; as a glorified Body doth from itself on Earth.
For both those are <hi>Natural:</hi> here one is <hi>Natural,</hi> the other is <hi>Spiritual.</hi> Nay
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49838:141"/>
an Angel doth not so much differ from a Worm in its Essence, and Image. For
an Angel is still a piece of Nature, a part of the first Creation, all which the
Holy Ghost comprehendeth under the term of <hi>Natural.</hi> But a Body risen from
the dead is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> of a new Creation; for <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> vastly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from, vastly above every thing within the compass of this whole world
in the visible, or invisible part of it.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Proposition, observe how St. <hi>Paul</hi> begins this discourse
with a quick touch; <hi>Thou Fool!</hi> Thick skales of folly do lie indeed upon the
Eyes of our mind, if we perceive not all things in this Flesh to be in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
of Sin, Death, Wrath, the Devil, by his Sorceries. That which we call
Death, is the casting off the disguise. In the Spirit we see, and are seen with
open Face.</p>
               <p>Prop. 2. <hi>The</hi> Second Proposition, <hi>which is the</hi> Second Story <hi>in my building
raised upon this</hi> Scripture, <hi>is this;</hi> we may not compare the Body of Christ in
Heaven, with the Body of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise. <hi>This Proposition riseth up plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of St.</hi> Pauls <hi>words,</hi> v. 46. And so it is written; the first man <hi>Adam</hi>
was made a living Soul; the last <hi>Adam</hi> was made a quickning Spirit. Three
<hi>things lie plain in these words compared with the</hi> Context.</p>
               <p>1. The Apostle-speaketh of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> with a peculiar, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
respect to the <hi>Bodies</hi> of either. The <hi>Subject,</hi> which he now professedly
handleth, is the Resurrection of the <hi>Body.</hi> He bringeth this up to its <hi>Principle,</hi>
and <hi>Pattern,</hi> the <hi>Glorified Body of Christ.</hi> In the <hi>verse</hi> before he established
this Assertion, as a Pillar, on which the whole Frame and Fabrick of Divine
Truths here delivered doth lean; <hi>There is a Natural Body, and there is a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Body,</hi> He strengtheneth that distinction by this Root, and main reason of
it in the <hi>verse</hi> immediately following; <hi>And so it is written; the first man</hi> Adam
<hi>was made a living Soul; the last</hi> Adam <hi>was made a quickning Spirit.</hi> You seo
clearly, that this relateth to the <hi>Natural,</hi> and the <hi>Spiritual Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Adam</hi> is here spoken of in respect to his <hi>Paradisical Body; Jesus Christ</hi>
to his <hi>Heavenly Body.</hi> The place from which this is cited is the History of
<hi>Adams</hi> Creation, as he was brought into Paradise; <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. As his Body
was taken new, and pure out of the Virgin-Earth before the fall, and the
curse: <hi>The first man was of the Earth Earthy, v.</hi> 47. such as the first Earth,
of which he was composed, which was then, say some, far siner than Christal,
Gold, or Pearl, yea than the Sun is now; <hi>Angelical Earth, Jesus Christ</hi> in that
Body, which here is meant, is <hi>The Lord from Heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. As much, as a <hi>living Soul</hi> differeth from the <hi>quickning Spirit;</hi> that is, as
much, as a small Stream of Life from the Ocean, which hath its Fountain in
itself, which is therefore unconfined, and infinite; as much, as a little Shadow
from the Eternal, Incomprehensible Truth, and Substance: such is the dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,
and disproportion between the beautiful Body of <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi>
and the Blessed Body of our dear Lord in <hi>Heaven.</hi> As the Earth in <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:49838:142"/>
and <hi>Appearance;</hi> in <hi>Greatness,</hi> and <hi>Glory;</hi> in <hi>vertue,</hi> and <hi>Comprehension</hi>
differeth from Heaven, not only this Heaven, which we see, not the Heaven
of Angels above our sight; but that Heaven, out of which our <hi>Jesus</hi> cometh,
as Lord of all, an Heaven higher, than all created Heavens: such is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the New-created Body of <hi>Adam,</hi> our first Father, which shone
about his spotless Soul, as the Light about the Sun; and the glorified Body
of <hi>Jesus,</hi> our first, and last Lord, and Love. O all ye, that hear, and believe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
with me the insiniteness of the wisdom, and love of our God, who hath
made the loss of Paradise by Sin so great a gain to us, instead of that, giving
us our <hi>Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we shall come yet more clearly to the mark, at which we aim, if we
examine these words more exactly. To that end I shall propound <hi>three Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Question,</hi> What the general Nature of a <hi>Body</hi> is.</p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>A</hi> Body <hi>is the compleat</hi> Image, Instrument, <hi>and</hi> Fulness <hi>of that</hi> Soul,
<hi>or</hi> Spirit, <hi>to which it doth belong,</hi> Col. 2. 17. <hi>A</hi> Body, <hi>and a</hi> Shadow <hi>are set
opposite one to another.</hi> Which are a Shadow of things to come, but the Body
is of Christ, or is Christs, is the Body of Christ. <hi>A</hi> Body, <hi>and a</hi> Shadow <hi>agree in
being an</hi> Image. <hi>But the</hi> Shadow <hi>is a</hi> confused, useless, emply Image: <hi>the</hi> Body
express, Instrumental, Substantial, <hi>and full. In the same Chapter a little before,</hi>
v. 9. <hi>we read of the Lord</hi> Iesus; in him dwelleth all the Fulness of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Head
bodily. <hi>God is the</hi> Person <hi>in</hi> Christ, <hi>the</hi> glorified Body <hi>of our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
is the</hi> express Image <hi>of the God-Head. God is seen there, as a Man is at
home in his house; nakedly, clearly, familiarly, constantly, entirely, in all Forms,
and Postures. This glorious</hi> Body <hi>is the Universal, and Immediate</hi> Instrument
<hi>of the God-Head, the</hi> Sphear <hi>of its Activity. God judgeth all, acteth all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth
all the operations of the Divine Nature, and life here, as the Sun run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his race from the beginning to the end of it in his proper Orb, and Heaven.
God dwelleth with all his fulness in this Body. He delighteth to pour out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Body of our Beloved, and his Beloved, all the precious Treasures of his
God-Head. Here he delighteth to possess, and enjoy them in a Bodily Form,
in the Form of a Spiritual, Heavenly, and Divine Body. As at the</hi> Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>the</hi> word was made Flesh. A Body of Flesh, Iohn 1. 14. by emptying <hi>it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to nothing: so now is the</hi> Eternal Word <hi>again in the</hi> Resurrection <hi>made a</hi>
Spiritual Body <hi>by returning, and rising up into all its Fulnesses in the same</hi> Body
<hi>in which he had emptied himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> speaketh of himself in Glory, when he saith; <hi>In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house are many Mansions; John</hi> 14. 2. The Body of our Bridegroom
is a Spiritual Palace, in which all the excellencies, and Off-springs, all the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and works of the Divine Nature have their several distinct Mansions, and
apartments. We read of a Tree, in the branches of which all the Birds of
Heaven have their Nests. The Spiritual Body of <hi>Christ</hi> is the Tree of Life,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49838:142"/>
and of Love, which hath Branches enough; and large enough for all the Birds
of the highest Heaven, the seven Spirits of God with all their Train, all the
variety of the God-Head to make their several Nests in them. I may add also;
for all the Beasts of the Field, all inferiour Forms of Things to lodge under
its Shadow.</p>
               <p>You, who love the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and his Appearances, doth not this move
you, doth not this make your hearts to spring, and dance in your breasts, to
hear, that your Saviour is cloathed with this Heavenly Body, so full of Glory,
and of God? Can we forbear now from saying to our own hearts, and one to
another these <hi>five short words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>If we have formerly known any thing besides our Jesus, let us now know
it no more.</hi> If we have hitherto known <hi>Christ after the Flesh,</hi> let us know him
so no more. This is the only object worth all our knowledge, and study;
<hi>Jesus</hi> in his <hi>Spiritual Body,</hi> purer, and brighter than the Body of Heaven in
Paradise, far beyond that in the height, variety, and compass of its Glories.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>How black doth every Sin appear in this Light of our Lords glorified
Body.</hi> When a Soldier was about to kill <hi>Cresus,</hi> his dumb Son cryed out; <hi>thou
killest the King.</hi> So cry to every Lust in thine heart: thou crucifiest my Jesus
in his Spiritual Body, the Body of all Divine Beauties shining like a Divine
Sun upon thee, comprehending thee, as the highest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaven. In every Creature
in which thou seest not the blessed Light of this Body, in which thou doest
not kiss it with the pure mouth of the Spirit in thee, thou doest crucisy it.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Is not this Bosom, this Heavenly Body of our Beloved, a Field of Lillies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the Field of all Spiritual Beauties, and Divine Graces? Shall we not, like
pleasant Roes be ever feeding here? As Booz said to Ruth;</hi> let us never go into
any other Field, to gather, or to feed? Is not this the Paradise itself in the
third Heavens, where all the Fulnesses of the God-Head are in a <hi>Body,</hi> a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Body.</p>
               <p>4. How pure, and Spiritual are we to be in Body, and Spirit, if we are to be
Brides to this Lamb of God, whose Body outshineth all the Angels, and is raised
to a degree of Spirituality far above them?</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Is this that Body, of which the poorest believing Soul may say by the Law
of its Spiritual Marriage; my Jesus hath not power over his own Body, but I
have power over it, to command its presence with me; to delight my self in it, as
my Garden of Eden, of pleasure; to bring forth Fruit by it?</hi> Is this that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Body of <hi>Christ</hi> to which these vile Bodies, yours and mine, are to be
made like by that Power, by which he is able to subdue all things to himself,
to the similitude of this Body of Divine Glories? Is this the Body, into which
we are taken up, and which we are at home with, when in death we are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
from these Bodies of our Pilgrimage here?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. What the force of this phrase is, <hi>A Living Soul. The first</hi> Adam <hi>was
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49838:143"/>
made a Living Soul.</hi> Was he not made a <hi>Body</hi> as well, as a <hi>Soul?</hi> The Body
seemeth to be so far from being concerned here, that it is excluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This Word <hi>Soul</hi> hath <hi>Three</hi> Acceptions in the New Testament, and so
that, which answereth it in the Old.</p>
               <p>1. It is taken for the <hi>Person</hi> composed of Soul and Body. So <hi>Gen. 46. 26.
All the Souls which came with</hi> Jacob <hi>out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>which came out of his loyns;</hi>
that is; All the <hi>Persons.</hi> For the Immortal Soul cometh not out of the Parent's
loyns.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Soul</hi> signifieth the <hi>Natural State</hi> by the <hi>first Creation</hi> in distinction
from the <hi>Spiritual State</hi> by <hi>Grace,</hi> 1 Cor 2. 14. <hi>The Natural man receiveth not
the things of the Spirit.</hi> It is properly; The Man of <hi>Soul.</hi> So in this; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
44. <hi>There is a Natural Body; there is a Spiritual Body.</hi> In Greek it is <hi>There is
the Body of a Soul; and the Body of a Spirit.</hi> The word is the same there, and
in <hi>v.</hi> 45. A Living <hi>Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. By <hi>Soul</hi> is meant that <hi>Life,</hi> which the Soul exerciseth in the Body, and
which dependeth upon the Body; The Life of <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> as it is inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
from <hi>Sense,</hi> Jude 19. <hi>Sensual, not having the Spirit.</hi> The word <hi>Sensual</hi>
is the same with Soul; <hi>Men of Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From these Scriptures laid together you may collect this Explanation of a
<hi>Living Soul:</hi> A Natural Person living a Life of Sense and of Reason awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Sense, and inseparably tied to Sense in an Earthly Body. The Body is
as the tree; the Life as the Sap; the Root as the Person, out of which both
spring, and in which both are comprehended. Such as the Tree is such is the
Sap, and such the Root, which have their perfection in the Tree. Such as the
Earthly Body is, such is the Life, such is the Person of the first <hi>Adam.</hi> For
the Body is the Result, and proper Image of the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the surest, and clearest Light into this Phrase,</hi> a Living Soul, <hi>will be
that</hi> Scripture, <hi>where it is first used, and whence it is cited:</hi> Gen. 2. 7. And
the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his Nostrils
the breath of Life, and man became a Living Soul. <hi>Three things lie plain in
this Text. 1. The denomination of</hi> Man <hi>is put peculiarly, and signally
upon the</hi> Body. God formed Man of the dust of the Earth. 2. <hi>That part in
Man distinct from the Body is expresly here named</hi> a breath of Life. 3. <hi>The</hi>
Living Soul <hi>is the Body having received the breath of Life into it.</hi> Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Living Soul. Man <hi>relateth evidently to the beginning of the</hi> verse;
God formed Man, that is, the Body, of the dust of the Earth. <hi>So in this Chapter
to the</hi> Corin. <hi>The</hi> Body <hi>is called the</hi> Man. The first Man is of the Earth Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y.
v. 46. <hi>The reason why the</hi> Holy Ghost <hi>peculiarly respected the</hi> Body,
<hi>while he speaketh of Man, seemeth to be this; the Body was the united Image,
and Fulness of all those Beings, and Beauties, which were divided thorow the
whole C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eation; a most harmonious Body, and sacred Collection of all those
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iving Exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lences, Appearances, and Operations of the Eternal Spirit, which
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49838:143"/>
made up the several Creatures like single Flowers in a Garden. Thus the Body
of</hi> Adam <hi>was a Paradise in Paradise, the Paradise of Paradise. The breath
of Life was in this glorious Body, as a Spring in a Garden, to quicken,
and to animate it. Without this Body, the breath of Life is naked, and solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
except</hi> Christ <hi>above the Law of Nature be in the place of a Body to it;
which</hi> St. Paul <hi>signifieth;</hi> 2 Corin. 5. 6, 8. <hi>Where he speaketh of</hi> being at
home in the Body, and absent from the Lord; <hi>and again of</hi> being absent from the
Body, and present with the Lord.</p>
               <p>By this time it appeareth with some clearness, that the <hi>living Soul,</hi> is either
the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>First Man</hi> having received the <hi>breath of Life</hi> into it; or at
least, his <hi>Person</hi> consisting of <hi>Both,</hi> comprehending Both, but with a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
respect to the <hi>Body.</hi> This only I will add, that nothing is more frequent
with most Authors, and Languages, than to express the <hi>Soul</hi> without the <hi>Body</hi>
by a Shade, or <hi>Shadow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now finished the 2d. Question, What we are to understand by a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Soul.</hi> Before I pass from it, let us make a stand here while we hearken to
a Twofold Voice from Heaven sounded in the very Essence of a <hi>Living
Soul:</hi> 1st. O Living Soul! cease from thy self, and from every thing round
about thee. 2. O Living Soul! cast thy self into the Bosom of thy Saviour, and
cleave to Him.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>O Living Soul! cease from thy self, and from every thing round about thee</hi>
Consider, what thou art, what an Emptyness, what a Vanity what a Nothing.
Thy Body is of the Earth Earthly. The Earth is a meer Darkness, without any
Form or Vertue, except that which it receiveth by the impression of Heaven,
above it, figuring itself upon it, like the Images of the Sky in the Waters.
Thy Body is a piece of this Darkness. All that which it hath of Being, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Goodness, is the Figure of the Heavenly Body of Christ cast from above
upon it. Thus thy Body in Paradise was a Shadow onely, What then is the
Breath of Life in this Body, which is suitable to it, and confined to it; which
hath this Body for its only Cloathing, for its proper Image, and Fulness, which
hath the Compleatness, of its Subsistency, and Operations in it; which hath
it for its Glass, in which alone it beholdeth it self, and all Objects, in which
alone it converseth with them? This is a Shadow of a Shadow, a Shadow in
a Shadow, the Dream of a Shadow: The Body a Shadow, the Life of this
Body the Dream of a Shadow. The Person then, which consisteth of this Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy
Life in a Shadowy Body, can be but a Shadowy Person. This is the
Best of Man in his best Estate; the Living Soul in its primitive purity and
<hi>Glory; Adam</hi> in Paradise; a Shadow, and no more. So saith the Holy Ghost,
<hi>Rom. 5. The first man was a Figure,</hi> a rude Type, a confused Shadow <hi>of Him,
who was to come.</hi> The Shadow lyeth upon the ground, often moveth, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
before the Body. But the Body is first, is above it, casteth the Shadow
from it, and governeth all its Motions. If this were Man, the golden Head,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49838:144"/>
and Sun in the Paradiscal world; if all the Creatures in their Paradisical
Births, and Beauties went forth, were renewed every moment from the Divine
Presence resting in the Center of his Person, and surrounding him; as Beams
go forth from the Sun; what then were all the pieces of Nature in their first
Strength, Lustre, and Sweetness, but Shadows of this Shadow? None had the
Principle, or Truth of its being in itself, nor the Power of itself for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But now Man, and the whole Creation are fallen by Sin; the Figure in
the Shadow is defaced; the Impression, and Image of the Eternal Glory in the
Darkness of the Creature, which gave it a Being, a Beauty, a Force, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn.
The Frame of Nature is now a Pit of Darkness full of Confusion,
where Death reigneth in the midst of all sorts of deformity and weakness.</p>
               <p>That Counsel of the Lord was seasonable in Paradise itself: <hi>Es. 2. l. Cease
from Man, whose breath is in his Nostrils,</hi> who hath only a Shadowy life in a
Shadowy Body; <hi>wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> Cease from every thing of
Nature, and the Creature. It was at best a Shadow. What Excellency then
hath it to be esteemed of, and reckoned upon? What stability, or Strength to
be trusted to, and relied upon? Can you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ill your Embraces with an empty
Shadow? Can you hold fast in your Arms a flying Shadow? Will the Eye
of your Spirit be satisfied with seeing Light; your heart be filled with Life;
shall your Soul feed upon Substance in a Shadow? This is the <hi>first voice</hi> from
Heaven sounded in the very essence of a <hi>living Soul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>O living Soul cast thy self into the Bosom of thy Saviour, and cleave to
him.</hi> Dost thou not now perceive plainly, that he is thy Root, thy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
thy Life, thy Strength, thy Fulness, thy Light, thy Righteousness, thy
Perfection, thy Glory; in a word, thy true self; when thou art in thy best
state a Shadow only of him according to the first Creation? Is not this the
Beauty of Nature in thee, and thy Moral Righteousness to bear the Figure of
him, and his Tabernacle in thy Person? Is not this thy Spiritual Glory, thine
everlasting Righteousness to be taken up into him, and to be cloathed with him,
to have thy Shadow drunk up into his Light? Is not this the Life, Strength,
and rest of both states to be united to him, to be acted by him in that Union,
to be resigned again to him in, and thorow all Actings, or Sufferings?</p>
               <p>Let us consider what wretched things we were in death, if it were not for
<hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> How would our poor Souls, when they were thrust forth, and cast
out of these Bodies wander eternally naked, empty, in the dark, and desolate,
driven up and down with the Storm without, burnt upon within by the unseen
Fire of Divine wrath? But now <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath been to all his Saints from
the Fall, the <hi>Seed of a glorious Body,</hi> into which they retreated passing from
hence, and were at rest, as in a Bed of Love, which was green, and springing.
Since the Resurrection our breath of Life in Death, and in the Fall of this
frail Body drops into the Bosom of that Heavenly Body of our Beloved, as the
ground of Divine Life and Glory, from thence to grow up into, and flourish
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49838:144"/>
in an Immortal Body of its own, like unto it, and by a Divine Union joyned
with it in Eternal Embraces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. In what sense the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is here said to be a <hi>Quickning Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I answer <hi>three things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as it comprehendeth both Natures, Divine and
Humane; both parts of the <hi>Humane Nature, Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> is a <hi>Quickning
Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>The</hi> Humane Nature <hi>is expresly spoken of to be a</hi> Quickning Spirit. The
last <hi>Adam</hi> was made a Quickning Spirit. Again; the Second Man is the Lord
from Heaven. v. 47.</p>
               <p>3. The Body of our Lord is principally intended under this description of
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Quickning Spirit.</hi> This appeareth by the whole Scope of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this
place, which is to shew with what Bodies the dead Saints are raised and come
again. <hi>v.</hi> 35. This is manifested by the <hi>Context.</hi> All the foregoing, all the
following <hi>verses</hi> treat of this Subject, the <hi>Body</hi> in the Resurrection. Mention
is made of a <hi>Natural,</hi> and a <hi>Spiritual Body</hi> in the <hi>verse</hi> immediately before.
<hi>v.</hi> 44. The same are again brought in immediately after. <hi>v.</hi> 46.</p>
               <p>Then the force of the Comparison, and Opposition maketh this plain. It is
a sure Rule; Comparisons, and Oppositions must speak of the same thing, to
the same point, and in the same respect. We have endeavoured to prove, that
the <hi>living Soul</hi> chiefly, and emphatically marketh out the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> in
Paradise, when his Body had more of Life, and was more a Soul, more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,
than our Souls are now. Therefore the <hi>Quickning Spirit</hi> opposed to
the <hi>living Soul</hi> must especially design the <hi>Body</hi> of our <hi>Jesus</hi> in Glory.</p>
               <p>Lastly, other Scriptures say the same thing. <hi>John 3. 6. That which is born
of the Flesh is Flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> That which is
born of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is not only <hi>Spiritualized,</hi> heightned, and adorned with Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
qualities, like the Picture of a Man with Lines, and Colours; or the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a Man richly gilded; One is a Stone, the other a piece of Canvas still.
But it is a Spirit substantially, and essentially. It is a Spirit, not as a Soul, or an,
Angel is a Spirit; but as that Spirit is, of which it is born, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
in which; <hi>That which is born of the Flesh, is Flesh substantially,</hi> and Flesh
of the same kind with that, which bringeth it forth.</p>
               <p>As the Father and the Son have both the same humane Nature in a humane.
Form: The humane Nature is one in both. But the humane Form is distinct
in each, and maketh them <hi>two Persens:</hi> so the Divine Nature of the <hi>Eternal
Spirit</hi> springeth up in a Divine Form in that, which is born of it. The Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Spirit bringeth its Birth forth in a Divine Form, and at once together with
that, itself with its own Divine Nature, and Divine Form dwelling in it; as
the Root, the Life; the Form, the Fulness, the Fruit, the Perfection, the
Truth, the Glory of it; the Spiritual Temple, the God in the Temple; both
Spirits in the same Form; both mutually Temples to each other; both one
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49838:145"/>
Spirit. Thus it is made a <hi>Spirit;</hi> in the same Form with its <hi>Mother-Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Spirit</hi> itself. It is made a <hi>distinct Spirit.</hi> It is made one Spirit with the
<hi>Fountain Spirit.</hi> It is made a <hi>Quickning Spirit,</hi> having the Fountain of Life,
and Spirits in itself.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Body</hi> of our blessed Saviour in the Resurrection is new-born from
above, of the Spirit of Life. It is therefore a <hi>Spirit of Life, a Fountain-Spirit,
a Quickening Spirit.</hi> The Resurrection doth not gild, doth not spiritualize the
<hi>Personal,</hi> or <hi>Mystical Body of Jesus Christ.</hi> It maketh them Gold within, as well, as
without. It maketh them all throughout pure, and fine Gold; a Spirit of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
In this Creation, and in natural things, all excellencies are Qualities, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents;
all Beauties are no more, than skin-deep. In the new Creature, in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Things every excellency is a substance, every Beauty is the Essence, and
Person itself; there a Spirit is not excellent, or Beautiful, or Immortal. But
each Excellency, each Beauty, Immortality is that Spirit. The Person, the
Spirit is the Excellency, the Beauty, Immortality itself. Each distinct excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
is a distinct Spirit; and all Excellencies, all Spirits are one in each one,
making that a full Assembly the whole Quire in itself. They all dwell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and are made <hi>perfect in one.</hi> This is the <hi>New-Creature,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual
Birth,</hi> the Resurrection from the Dead. How happy, and blessed are they,
who have their part in this Birth, in this Resurrection!</p>
               <p>There is another Scripture to this purpose, 1 <hi>Corin. 6. 17. He that is joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> In the verse before he had said; <hi>What, know ye not,
that he who is joyned to an Harlot is one Body. For two,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall be one
Flesh. v.</hi> 16. Here the discourse is clearly of the <hi>Body.</hi> As the earthly Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
maketh <hi>two Bodies one Flesh:</hi> the Heavenly Marriage maketh them one
Spirit. The union between our glorified Lord, and our Bodies in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
is as immediate, and entire, as between our Saviour, and our Souls;
so that these also are Spirits, and one Spirit with him. Is not his Body then
first a Spirit? Doth not the Union between the Divine Nature, and his Blessed
Body make that a Spirit, and one Spirit with itself? The glorified Body, and
Soul of a Saint are one Spirit. They are one Spirit with the glorified Body,
and Soul of their <hi>Jesus,</hi> with the three Persons in the Trinity, with all Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and blessed Spirits. All are one Spirit. Yet are they all distinct Spirits. If
the distinction were taken away, the Harmony, the Beauty, the Musick, the
Marriage-joy, and Marriage-love in Heaven were all lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will say; how can this be? Are not <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
How then can a <hi>Body</hi> be a <hi>Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are every where in <hi>Scripture</hi> opposed one to the other:
but not so a <hi>Body,</hi> and a <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those very Terms, on which the Contrariety is set so frequently by the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> between <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> shew that the Heavenly Body, the true
Body, the Body of Life, and Glory is a Spirit. I shall instance only in a <hi>Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49838:145"/>
Opposition;</hi> one where the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> are set as <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi>
the other, where they are set as the <hi>Truth,</hi> or Beauty itself, and the <hi>Vail</hi> upon it.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>First is Rom. 8. 6. To be carnally minded is Death; but to be Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually-minded
is Life, and Peace.</hi> In each of these Words <hi>Life, Peace,</hi> all Joys
of Life and Immortality are expressed by the language of the Spirit. Both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
are Joys heaped upon Joys; Blessedness upon Blessedness, to express the
Infiniteness in which they rise up ever New, though there can be never any
thing more; Or the Circle of Eternity, where all Fulnesses of Life, and Joy run
one into another, multiplying themselves upon themselves endlesly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Life</hi> is the Flourishing State of Things, a Perpetual Spring. The Happiness
of Princes, the Blessedness of the Divine Nature is sum'd up in Life. <hi>Live, O
King! The Lord liveth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peace</hi> is the whole Gift and Legacy of <hi>Christ</hi> to His Saints. <hi>My Peace I
leave with you, My Peace I give unto you.</hi> It is All the Good that goeth along
with His Presence and Appearance in His Immortal state. Hee stood in the
midst of them saying; <hi>Peace be with you,</hi> when He appeared to them after His
Resurrection. <hi>Peace</hi> is the Plenary Rest of all Parts and Faculties of the whole
Person in a perfect Union with, and full Fruition of their proper Objects in
Perfection.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greek</hi> Word for <hi>Peace</hi> signifieth the <hi>Band</hi> of all Perfections, the Circle
of Eternity; All things within and without, linked together in the Golden
Chain of a Blessed and Divine Harmony, making an Ornament of Beauty for
the Soul to put on, making a Mus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck to charm the Soul into the Divine Sleep of
the sweetest, and deepest Complacency. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue expresseth Both
<hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> by one Word. This is the Name of him, who was the
Eminent Figure of <hi>Christ</hi> in Glory; <hi>Solomon.</hi> This is the Name of <hi>Jesus</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as He sitteth upon the Throne of the Divine Nature in the Kingdom of
the Spirit, <hi>Isa. 9. 6. The Prince of Peace;</hi> Some translate it very properly; <hi>The
Prince; The Peace or Perfection, Shalom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to apply this to our purpose; The Image of things, as they stand in the
Spirit, is in it self; the Appearance of things in this Image is, to those who see
it, <hi>Life, and Peace;</hi> that is, Eternity of Blessedness, Heaven it self. But the Image,
and Appearance of things in <hi>Flesh</hi> is not onely Dying, or Dead; It is <hi>Death</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The Life of Nature, and of Flesh, is a Shadow onely of Life, and the
Death of the True Life, which is in the Spirit. This universal Image of things,
which we call <hi>the World,</hi> comprehending the whole Creation, in all its Beauty,
is no more than the <hi>Grave</hi> in which the Spiritual Image lyeth sleeping the
sleep of death.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>second Opposition</hi> between <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> is that of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and
the <hi>Vail</hi> upon the Truth, <hi>Job.</hi> 4. 24. Our Saviour saith; The Father seeketh
such Worshippers, as <hi>worship Him in Spirit, and Truth. Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> are
here joyned in the same sense, as <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> go together, <hi>Job. 6. v. 63.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49838:146"/>
The words, that I speak, they are Spirit, and they are Life.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> is the
<hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Life.</hi> The <hi>Flesh</hi> is a <hi>Dead Counterfeit,</hi> as a <hi>Picture</hi> is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
of a Man, being neither the Life, nor the Truth, 1 <hi>Joh. 6. 6. The
Spirit beareth witness. For the Spirit is the Truth.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> is the last, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Witness. For the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the Truth itself, the Universal and Eternal Truth.
There are <hi>two Maxims</hi> in Philosophy, that All <hi>Truths,</hi> and the <hi>Essences</hi> of
things are Eternal. The Truth then, and Essence of a Saint's Body, and of
Christ's, the true and essential Body, is a Spirit in the Eternal Spirit. It is not
Living, but Life it self.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Body of Flesh</hi> is a <hi>Vail</hi> upon this <hi>True Body,</hi> which is an Immortal Spirit.
So it is expresly named, <hi>Heb. 10. v.</hi> 20. where <hi>Christ</hi> is said to have entred,
and made a living way for us into the most Holy Place, <hi>by the rending of the Vail
that is, His Flesh.</hi> The true Body is a Spirit and Spring, of Immortality in the
most Holy Place, the Eternal Spirit. When it cometh forth from thence into
the open streets, and fields of this Creation, it casteth over itself the Vail of
this Fleshly Body. In Death it rendeth, and casteth off this Vail of Flesh;
so it returneth pure, and naked in the Resurrection into the most Holy Place,
into the Eternal Spirit again, where it ever stood after an unchangeable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in its simple, and unvailed Beauties. So is that Mystery of the Gospel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
in the blessed Body of our Saviour: <hi>No one goeth up into Heaven,
but he, who come down out of Heaven; the Son of Man, who is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But you will ask me now; <hi>What becometh of this Body of Flesh in the

               </p>
               <p>As the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was removed into the <hi>Temple,</hi> when the Temple was built
up, and set there, as a part of the Sacred Mysteries in that Holy Place: so
the Spiritual Body, when it is raised, taketh up into itself, and comprehendeth
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49838:146"/>
in itself the Vailing Form of Flesh, as a Beautiful Form in that Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
which it finisheth in itself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But you will say now perhaps; <hi>How is this done, by what Power,</hi> and
<hi>in what manner</hi> is the <hi>Body</hi> of our Lord in the Resurrection made a <hi>Quickning
Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer, that it is done by vertue of the <hi>Personal Union</hi> between the
<hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Humane Nature in Christ.</hi> The <hi>Person</hi> is the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Eternal
Spirit.</hi> This <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Soul,</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> of our beloved <hi>Jesus,</hi> are all <hi>one Person,</hi>
so all one Eternal Spirit, the Fountain of Life.</p>
               <p>As the Soul is said to be all in the whole Body, and All in every part of it:
so is the <hi>Person</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Immm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rtal Word</hi> All in the whole Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and All in every part of it, either <hi>Soul,</hi> or <hi>Body.</hi> The Union between the
Divine Nature in our Bridegroom, and his glorified Body is equally immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
and entire, as between that, and his Triumphant Soul.</p>
               <p>The Humane Nature subsisteth, and standeth in the Divine, as a Tree in its
Root. But this Union in the days of his Flesh is as that between the Tree,
and its Root in Winter. The Resurrection is our Saviours Spring-time, and
Summer. Every living Root in Spring ceaseth not to send forth its Sap into the
Tree, until it have brought forth the Tree into that Form, and laden it with
those Fruits, which are proper to the Root. In the Resurrection the Divine
Nature riseth up with all its Sweetness, and Fatness, all its Vertues and Powers
into the Humane Nature, till it have spread, and fashioned it entirely into its
own Form; till it have laden it all over with the precious Fruits of its own
excellencies, Joys, and Glories. In every power, part, and point of Soul, and
Body, though never so mean, so small, the Fountain of the God-Head openeth
itself; the Fulness of the God-Head poureth forth itself, that as the Waters
cover the Sea, so every distinct Part, or Point appeareth, as a distinct Sea of
the Divine Life, Joys, Loves, and Glories without bottom, or bound.</p>
               <p>This, O shadowy Man, O faln, lost Man, <hi>is thy Jesus, thy Life, thy Saviour.</hi>
Look to this <hi>Jesus</hi> with an Eye of <hi>Faith</hi> with an Eye of Love, live <hi>by Him,</hi>
live <hi>in Him,</hi> live <hi>to Him.</hi> Triumph thou because of this <hi>Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Look to Him as, 1. <hi>Thy Principle.</hi> 2. Thy <hi>Pattern.</hi> 3. Thy <hi>Price.</hi> 4. Thy <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Look to this <hi>Jesus,</hi> who is All-Beautiful with the Beauty of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Head
itself, as thy <hi>Principle. I am the vine, ye are the branches. He, that abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in me, and I in him, bringeth forth much fruit. Without me ye can do nothing,</hi>
saith <hi>Jesus Christ, Job.</hi> 15. 5. The Tree first comprehendeth the Branch in itself,
then sendeth it forth, supplying it continually with its own Life and Sap. By the
vertue of this Life &amp; Sap the Branch taketh hold of the Tree, sucketh in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
fresh and vital nourishment, by which it flourisheth, and bringeth forth
much fruit. What shall I say for thee, who yet partakest not of the sweetness,
and fatness of this Spiritual Tree of Life, and love? Thou canst bring forth no
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49838:147"/>
Fruit, thou canst do nothing towards thine own fruitfulness. Without this
<hi>Jesus</hi> thou canst do nothing. O that thou didst understand thine own Emptiness,
and the Fulness of Sap in this Vine: How truly All things Angels, Men All the
Creatures can do nothing, are nothing without this <hi>Jesus, that Spirit,</hi> which is
the onely Truth, the onely Lfe in, and thorow All! I will pray over thee with
inward bleedings of Divine Love from my heart; O that <hi>Jesus</hi> thy Root, who
comprehendeth even thee also in the Fulness of His Heavenly sap, and vertue,
would bring thee forth by a new birth, as a Heavenly branch in Himself! O
that He would continually milk forth from His Breast the streams of His Life
into thee! Thus He abideth in thee. Now do thou, now wilt thou by Him abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in thee abide in Him. Shoot forth thy self into. Him, as roots do their Sprigs,
and Branches into the Earth beneath, by the actings of thy Faith upon him.
Draw his Spirit, and Grace into thy self. Be green, be fair, and flourishing
in the Eye of Heaven. Bring forth much Fruit for thy self; thy Saviour,
thy Heavenly Father, all Angels, and blessed Spirits to feed upon in Eternity.</p>
               <p>2. Look to this <hi>Jesus,</hi> as thy <hi>Pattern.</hi> What thou hast seen done in his Soul,
and Body, by the Union between these and the God-Head; the same Glory
shall be brought forth in thy Soul, and Body also by the Union between him,
and thee; if thou in thy Soul, and Body adhere, and stick to his glorified
Soul, and Body, as they are full of the Eternal Word dwelling in them, and
resting upon them. The Angels reproved the Disciples, when <hi>Christ</hi> was taken
up into Glory, because they looked to a visible Heaven to see their glorified
Lord still with Eyes of Flesh: <hi>Why stand you here gazing up into Heaven?
This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as ye have seen him go into Heaven.</hi> I say to you in another sense: stand,
and look upon your <hi>Jesus,</hi> as he ascends. This is your <hi>Pattern.</hi> As you have seen
him in his Humane Nature go up out of all Fleshly, and Visible Images into
an Invisible Glory; as you have seen him taken out of the sight of every
created Eye in the white Cloud of the most excellent Majesty of the <hi>Father,</hi>
which is the Heaven of Heavens, so shall the same <hi>Jesus</hi> in like manner come
again in your Souls, and Bodies, descending into them upon those Spiritual Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and changing them by degrees from Glory to Glory, till they also put
off every thing of Flesh, and disappearing to every natural Eye, be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the same Spirit, to be for ever together with him there, where he is, and
like him.</p>
               <p>3. Look to <hi>Jesus,</hi> as thy <hi>Price.</hi> The Lord taketh notice of the low thoughts,
and disesteem, which the <hi>Jews</hi> had of him by that, which they gave for him
thirty pieces of Silver: <hi>This,</hi> saith he by the Prophet, <hi>is the Price, at which
they valued me.</hi> Thou that seemest to thy self the least, and poorest in all the
flock of <hi>Christ,</hi> see the great, the unimaginable thoughts of esteem, and love
in the heart of God for thee; O man see the honour, and affection, which
thy God hath for thy Soul, how precious it is in his Eye. This is the price, at

which the Father valueth thee, this <hi>Jesus</hi> his onely Son, full of God, and
of Glory, enriched all over in his whole Person, with all the Treasures of the

                  <hi>Propos.</hi> 3. I drew the Platform of a Building for the countenancing of my
<hi>Second Rule</hi> in <hi>Direction</hi> to the knowledge of the <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>Beauties</hi> of our
glorified Saviour. I laid the ground of my Building in the latter part of that,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. I cast this Building into <hi>three Stories</hi> comprised in <hi>three Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
I have finished <hi>two</hi> of them according to my model.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Rule</hi> for the sake of which I designed this Frame, and Fabrick
was, that <hi>Spiritual Things are to be compared with Spiritual.</hi> The two <hi>Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which were as the two Stories in the Building were these. 1. <hi>The Body
of our Jesus in Heaven is not to be compared with his Body on Earth, either living,
or dying. 2. There is no Comparison between the glorified Body of our Beloved
in Heaven, and the first, the fairest Body of</hi> Adam <hi>in Paradise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am now to add the <hi>Third Story,</hi> so to lay the Top-stone, and to compleat
my Building.</p>

Prop. 3. <hi>The Third Proposition</hi> is this: <hi>The Spiritual Body of our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour
is to be compared with its own Spiritual Principle, and Pattern,</hi> The Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
Form, and Furniture for this Piece of the Building are taken out of that
<hi>Scripture, 1. Cor. 15. 47. The first man is of the Earth, Earthy: the second man
the Lord from heaven.</hi> See here Two distinct principles, and Patterns of two
several Men, differing not onely, as distinct Individuals of the same Kind;
but in their whole Essence, and Nature, as Heaven, and Earth; the Shadow,
and the Substance; the Life, and the Picture.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>First Man</hi> is <hi>Earth:</hi> the <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Second Man
is Heaven.</hi> From these <hi>two Principles</hi> these two Men take their whole <hi>Nature
Name,</hi> and <hi>Image.</hi> They take their <hi>Nature</hi> entirely from their <hi>Principles. The
first man is of the Earth, Earthy: the second Man is the Lord from Heaven. v.</hi>
47. As the Mettals take their Essence, and Substantial Form from the Mine,
in which they are bred, and out of which they are drawn: so the <hi>first Adam,</hi>
from the Mine of Earth below is Earth in his Substance, and Essence. The <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Man Jesus</hi> risen from the Dead is pure Heaven quite thorow in the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,
and Essential Parts of His Immortal Substance, as well, as in the
Ornaments, and Beautifyings of it. For He cometh forth from a Mine of
finest Gold. Hee is the <hi>Lord,</hi> of a <hi>Nature</hi> in it self above All, and over All,
<hi>from Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>two Men</hi> take their <hi>Name</hi> also from their <hi>Principle. As is the Earthy,
such are they that are Earthy: as is the Heavenly, such are they that are Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly:
v.</hi> 48. Behold the Earthy, and the <hi>Heavenly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They take their <hi>Image</hi> too from their <hi>Principle. As we have born the Image
of the Earthy: we shall also bear the Image of the Heavenly.</hi> The <hi>Heavenly</hi> One
beareth the Image of His proper Heaven, out of which He cometh, and so
bringeth Heaven down in Himself, The <hi>Earthy One</hi> is cloathed with the Image
of the Earth, out of which He is taken. Thus the <hi>Principle</hi> is the <hi>Pattern</hi> also.
Each Man is All that, which He is, for Matter, and Form; Substance, and
Image; Stuff, and Trimming; Metal, and Fashion from his own <hi>Principle.</hi>
The <hi>Principle</hi> is both the Mine, and Mint. Each Man of these Two comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
His Principle in Himself; the One, the Earth; the Other, Heaven in His
Heart, and Face; in His Root, Substance, and Sap, as also in His Form, Flower,

               <p>I Know no piece of Knowledge in the whole Gospel, of more consequence,
upon which more of Divine Light; more of Divine Life, and Strength: more
of Divine Sweetness, Comfort, and Joy dependeth, than a right Understanding
of the Difference between these <hi>Two,</hi> the <hi>Earthy,</hi> and the <hi>Heavenly</hi> One. This
is the Golden Key, which openeth not the little Wicket, but the great Gate
into the Kingdom of God; the Several Natures of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Christ in His
Humanity;</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> by <hi>Creation,</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> by <hi>Adoption; Man in Paradise, a
Saint in the Spirit and in Heaven.</hi>

These are to be Know by their <hi>Principles</hi> onely. For their <hi>Principles</hi> are
their Patterns.</p>
               <p>Their Principles are <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Heaven.</hi> These will be best Known by their
Answering, and Opposition one to another. All, that is, is divided into Heaven,
and Earth.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Earth,</hi> which is the Principle of the <hi>First man</hi> is to be sought out
and discovered, that we may upon that Foot-stool ascend to the Throne; that
we may come more distinctly, and clearly by Degrees to a Sight of that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
which is the Principle of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in Glory.</p>
               <p>This lyeth clear before us, that the <hi>Heaven</hi> understood in this place cannot
be any Visible, or Common Heaven, no, not any of the Created Heavens. This
is an Heaven above All. For He, who cometh forth from it, is Lord of All.
He is <hi>made Higher than All Heavens,</hi> by ascending into this <hi>Heaven,</hi> which
is of another Make different from all things of the First Creation; and hath a
New Name above every Name, that is named in this World, or that which
is to come; the World of Sense, or the World of Angels: <hi>Heb. 7. 26. Eph. 4.
v.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> then of which we speak cannot be the Common Earth. It must
be as large, as that mentioned, <hi>Gen. 1. v.</hi> 2. out of which the Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were made. The <hi>Earth</hi> intended here by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> taketh in all things
below the <hi>Heaven</hi> mentioned, and meant by Him. Angels with all the Invisible.
Glories of the First Creation are Gods arising up out of this <hi>Earth,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
within the Compass of it.</p>
               <p>I will set up <hi>Three Lights</hi> before you, by which I shall endeavour to give
you a Prospect of this <hi>Earth,</hi> and of the <hi>First Man</hi> arising out of it, so, as to
be a Shadow, and a Figure of the <hi>Heaven</hi> we aim at, with our Bridegroom
coming down out of it, coming down in it, as His Mother of Eternal Love;
His Garment, and Crown of Divine Beauty; His Chariot of Life, and Light;
of Power, and Pleasure.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Light:</hi> God, as He is the Head of the First Creation, cometh not forth
Naked, but in a Shadowy Image of Himself, which He casteth, as a Vail, over
the true and proper Beauties of His own Person, which the Eye of no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ever saw, or can see, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> singeth the praises, and
wonders of God in the Creation. After the preface he beginneth thus: <hi>Who
coverest thy self with Light, as with a Garment, and stretchest out the Heavens, as
a Curtain; v.</hi> 2. You have a manifest allusion here to the Works of the First,
and Second Day; <hi>Gen,</hi> 1. The <hi>Jews</hi> say from this <hi>Scripture</hi> in the books of
their wise, and learned men, that God to make this World, appeared not in
His naked Beauties, but <hi>cum Indumentis suis,</hi> with a Garment for a Covering
upon Him. The Light, in which God shineth forth at the Beginning to form
a Mass of Darknes into a beautiful Creation, was onely a Shadow of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Light of His own Nature, and Substance, and a Vail upon it. The Glory
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:49838:149"/>
itself, the Divine Presence, and Appearance at the Head of this Creation, which
was spread over the whole Compass of it, as an Heaven, was a Curtain drawn
before the true Heaven, the true Glory, which stood behind this Curtain;
like the Oracle, in the most Holy place, while the First Tabernacle was not
yet removed This is the <hi>First Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Light:</hi> God in this Shadowy Image of himself is <hi>that Earth,</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Earth, out of which the first Man is made with a Divinity resting upon
him. <hi>Gen. 1. 26. God said; let us make man in our Image, after our Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ss.</hi>
The word <hi>Image,</hi> in Hebrew <hi>Tselem,</hi> seemeth to be a contract of two
words, <hi>Tsd Maveth,</hi> the <hi>Shadow of Death.</hi> It is used, <hi>Psal. 39. 6. Man
walketh in a vain show; they are disquieted in vain, or in vanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That other word used, <hi>Gen, 1. 26. Our Likeness,</hi> signisieth <hi>similitude, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>
an <hi>imagination, a cutting off.</hi> Both import thus much, that the Divine
Image, the Mother of the <hi>first Adam,</hi> in whose Womb he was formed, out of
whose Womb he sprung forth, upon whose breasts he hung, was a shadow, a
silent vanishing Shadow of the Eternal word, in which that slept, as in its
Night, or Death. As Dreams are Imaginations in the Fancy, which act their
parts while the Man sleepeth: such was this Image, after which Man with
the whole World was made. This was the Mother-Earth, which brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
him forth, which beareth him, which nurseth him in her Bosom, and dandleth
him on her Knees.</p>
               <p>We read; <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. God formed Man of the dust of the ground. The
word <hi>Ground</hi> is the same with <hi>Adam.</hi> It signifieth in its root a sparkling Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre,
and Ruddiness, like that of the best Rubies, to express which it is also u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
A sweet and glorious Light shining thorow a dark shade, like a rosie mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
or the Sun setting red in a lovely evening, because being low he shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
with his bright Beams thorow the rising mists, and vapours of the Earth;
is properly intended by this word. The Light of the God-Head sparkling in
a Shadow of himself, glowing under a Cloud, like a living Ruby from the
Rock of Eternity; this was <hi>Adamah,</hi> the <hi>Ground,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God formed <hi>Adam</hi> of the dust of this ground. The learned Jews para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
after this manner upon the <hi>dust</hi> here. As the skilful Apothecary bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his Spices to a small, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine powder, that by a more curious, and exact
mixture of them he may make them into a rich ointment, or cordial: so God
in the smallest, and least parts perfectly mingleth, and uniteth all the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
Powers, Forms, and Vertues of the several Creatures, as they lay toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in their first, and fairest Image, in their First-born state in himself. Of
these thus tempered he sormeth <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Second Image</hi> of the whole Creation
next to that in his own Person. Thus Man is as a living Crystal, in which
the entire Form of all the world visible, and invisible is seen transparently in
the whole Glass, and in every point of the Glass, by a ravishing concurrence
of all parts in each, the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nutest part, with a most beautiful, and divine
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49838:149"/>
Harmony arising from the accurate Mixture of that Precious Dust. Thus
Man is an Universal musick, where the well-measured Motions, and sweet
Sounds of all the Strings meet in every skilful Touch of every String; as a
New Circle of Heavenly Melody, and Delights spread from a New Center of
Life, and Love. Thus I pass from the Second to the <hi>Third Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Light:</hi> The <hi>First Adam</hi> was the Golden Head of the First Creation next
to God in <hi>Jesus Christ. St. John</hi> in the 1. <hi>chapter</hi> of his Gospel describeth the
order, and manner, in which the unfaln World came forth from God. The
<hi>Word,</hi> which was <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as He is God, the Essential, and Eternal Image
of the God-Head, was made by His own Almighty Power, according to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable
Counsel of His own All-Gracious, and All-Glorious Will, a Shadowy
Image of Himself. As upon the Vail of the most Holy Place were wrought in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Colours the Figures of those <hi>Cherubims,</hi> which stood within the Vail shining
in a rich Substance of Massy Gold: So was it in the most Holy <hi>Person</hi> of our
Saviour, the true, and living Temple of the Divine Nature, The Glories of
the Essential Image figured themselves upon this Mystical Vail of the Shadowy
Image. So the Beloved <hi>Apostle</hi> saith to us, while he openeth the Mysteries, and
Births of the Divine Love; <hi>v. 2. All things were made by Him;</hi> by his Lord,
and his Love; our Lord, and our Love, our <hi>Jesus.</hi> As He was the Essential
Image, and the Pattern upon the Mount of Eternity, All things were made <hi>by
Him;</hi> They were Copies taken of Him, Shadows cast from Him by the Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of an Overflowing Life, and vertue in Him. <hi>Without Him was nothing
made, v.</hi> 2. That expression <hi>Without Him;</hi> properly signfieth, apart in <hi>separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or <hi>disunion</hi> from Him; in a Self Subsistency. All the Creatures in their
Flower, in their Virgin-purities, and perfections stood, and flourished toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their united Beauties, and Sweetnesses in the <hi>Person</hi> of our Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,
as He made Himself a Shadowy Image. After this manner, was our
<hi>Jesus The Beginning of the Creation of God;</hi> and <hi>the First-born of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St John addeth; <hi>v. 3. In Him was Life.</hi> Some Interpreters joyn the latter
end of the <hi>second verse</hi> with the beginning of the <hi>third,</hi> and read; <hi>That which
was made, was Life in Him.</hi> The sense is the same. All the Creatures in the
<hi>Person of Christ</hi> did flourish, and shine together in the unstain'd Lustre, and
Harmony of One Divine Beauty. They did rejoyce, and sing together in the
Fellowship of One Divine Life, and Love. Here they see the Beauties, they
smell the sweetnesses, they tast the pleasant vertues, they feast upon the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Substances, they drink in the pure Lives, and Spirits of each other conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Life was the Light of Man, v.</hi> 3. From this Life-Image of the Creation
in <hi>Christ</hi> propagating itself Immediately, and entirely, springeth forth the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and Form of Man. Man is now a Light of Glory shining freshly, and
fully from the First Created Light, which subsisted in the Person of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

our Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> From the Fountain arising here, and going forth from this
<hi>Eden</hi> all the Creatures sprung up fresh, and new every moment, in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Beings, and Beauties, as they grew upon their proper, and distinct roots.</p>
               <p>By this you may understand the sense, in which <hi>Adam</hi> is said to be set in the
Garden <hi>to dress it, and to keep it; Gen. 2. To dress it,</hi> signifieth <hi>to serve it,</hi> or <hi>minister
to it.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> by his Resurre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion from the dead is set in the Heavenly
Paradise to dress, and keep that. So he saith of himself: <hi>I go to prepare a place
for you; John</hi> 14. The Paradise above is set in the glorified Person of the
Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> From the Father the Fountain of the God-Head opening himself
in his Bosom, he riseth up with an Eternal Form of Divine Glory into every
particular Saint, as into a Spiritual Plant of the Heavenly Paradise, which
comprehendeth all Paradise with its Root, Body, and Branches in itself. <hi>Jesus
Christ</hi> is the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> in the midst, the Center of the Eternal Paradise, on
which all the Fruits of this Garden grow. Each Fruit, each Plant in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is a Tree of Life compleat in itself bearing all the other Love-Plants, as
its own proper Branches, and Fruits. Thus this Paradise in the third Heavens
standeth <hi>in the Person of Christ,</hi> and standeth <hi>out of the Person of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the same similitude the Paradise below standeth first, standeth entire
in the Angelical Person of the first <hi>Adam.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in his Shadowy
Image riseth up first here, here first he formeth the fairest, and fullest figure of
himself. Every Angel, every Star, every Flower hath here its first, its freshest
Life, Beauty, and Sweetness. All fall in, and stand here, as parts of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
in the full Harmony. As all the parts of Musick flow forth from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Harmony, and are measured by it: so doth the <hi>first Man</hi> from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rising up into the universal Form of the whole Creation in himself, go
forth every moment freshly, and newly into the temporary Forms of each
particular Creature, each Angel, each Star, each Flower, ministring to them

It will afford us <hi>two Lessons</hi> of much use, and comfort.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Lesson.</hi> Fear, tremble, be confounded at the sight of Sin, and fly from
it with all your might. O Man! What a glorious Angel wast thou? How wert
thou in the similitude of God? the Crownof the whole Creation? Every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
stone was there. How is this goodly Creature faln? Thou art become
by Sin a Worm, and no Man; a Serpent creeping upon thy belly, and feeding
upon the dust of the Earth. All the Creatures grew, and flourished to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as a Nose-gay in thy Bosom, being in their Paradise there, and
living upon their Root. How art thou made a filthy, noisom sink, in which all
the Creatures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e covered with dirt, withered, and dead? O the Curse, that
goeth along with every Sin!</p>
               <p>I have heard of an Holy Divine, strong in Faith, who, haunted by an Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition
of the Devil in the form of an Hog, thus reproached him: <hi>Fie Satan
once a beautiful, and blessed Angel, dost thou now appear in the shape of a vile,
filthy Heg?</hi> The Devil was so stung with this reproof, that he went presently
away out of countenance, and vanished cut of that good Mans sight. When
we are tempted to any Sin of Lust, Covetousness, or Wrath, let us in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
say to our selves: <hi>Fie my Soul, once in the Likeness of God, once a Quire of Angels,
a Paradise in thine own Person; wilt thou now make thy self a Hag, a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Lesson.</hi> Set a high value upon <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> set your hearts upon him;
believe in him; love him; run into his arms; cleave to him. That Paradise,
that Purity, that Innocency, that light of Life, and Beauty, which you have
lost, are found again in his bosom changed from the Shadow to the Substance.
He, that was the Figure in the <hi>first Adam,</hi> and vanished out of your sight,
leaving you alone, naked, and desolate; the same is come again to you in the
<hi>second Adam,</hi> in the Truth, and life, to abide for ever with you. <hi>Augustus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
gloried, that he found the Buildings of <hi>Rome</hi> Bricks, but left them Marble.
Our Paradise was at first Earthly, and fading. Our <hi>Jesus</hi> hath prepared for us
in himself an Heavenly, unfading, eternal Paradise. When <hi>Caesar</hi> found <hi>Cato</hi>
his Enemy slain by his own hand, that he might not come into the power of
the Conqueror; <hi>Caesar</hi> spake these words over the dead body: <hi>I envy thee</hi>
Cato <hi>the glory of thy Death; seeing thou didst envy me the glory of thy Life.</hi>
Poor man! faln from the first Beauty, and Blessedness; lost in Death, and
Wrath; come to <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> do not thorow unbelief deny to him the glory
of restoring thy Beauty, and Blessedness to thee better, than at the first, by resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thee to the naked Bosom of Eternal Love, and the Substantial Joys of
eternal Life.</p>
               <p>But now it is time to pass on to our <hi>second Discovery,</hi> unto which all this
hath been a preparation only. We have seen the flourishing Earth of the <hi>first
Man,</hi> which is only as a sight in a Cross-bow, or Gun to direct our Eye to
the mark, which is the <hi>Heaven</hi> answering to this <hi>Earth.</hi> Blessed shall our Eyes
be, if they see this Heaven opening itself, and the Lord coming down out of
it, with all its glories under his Feet, and round about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:49838:151"/>
2. <hi>Heaven:</hi> God in the brightness of his own Substance, uncloathed of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
garment, appearing in the naked Beauties, and Loves of his <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and <hi>Person;</hi> this is the <hi>Heaven</hi> into which the Body of our Saviour as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth,
out of which it cometh, as a Bride from the bosom of her Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
as the <hi>Heavenly Eve</hi> from the side of her <hi>Heavenly Adam;</hi> Beauty of
his Beauty, Love of his Love; joyned to him inseparably in one Spirit, and
one eternal Glory.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Heaven</hi> over the head of the shadowy Image, the essential, and
eternal Image of the Father. This is the Resurrection of our <hi>Jesus</hi> from the
Dead; this is the sweet, and sacred Mystery of our Saviours death; the opening
of the shadow, as a Grave, in which the true Glory slept, that this might come
forth, and as it riseth, overspread the shadow; as it overspreadeth it, gather it
up into itself, which is the swallowing up of Death into the Victory and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
of Eternal Life; the darkness of the shadow into the everblessed light
of the beloved substance.</p>
               <p>Our Love is never awakened, or stirred up till himself please. When the
Beautiful, and Acceptable time is come, the true Glory, which lieth buried in
the shadow awakeneth, by a mysterious touch upon the shadow rendeth it, as a
<hi>Vail;</hi> then it looketh forth, and springeth like the morning, like the fair Moon,
like the pure Sun, the Figure, and the Life, all shining together with one Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in the Calm, and clear day of Eternity.</p>
               <p>I shall endeavour to explain, and confirm this to you by <hi>one Scripture;</hi>
John 17. 5. <hi>Father glorify me with thy self, with that Glory, which I had with
thee before the world was.</hi> Our dying Saviour prayeth for his humane Nature,
and for his divine Nature, only as it was united to, and sympathised with his
Manhood. The God-Head in its own single state, and simplicity is ever above
all passion, and so all prayer. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> prayeth to be glorified <hi>with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
in that Soul, and Body, in which he was presently to be cruci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Thieves; that <hi>in these</hi> he may be there, where the Father is, that is, <hi>in the
high, and holy place of Eternity;</hi> to this end that <hi>in these</hi> he may partake of the
glory of the Father there, in Eternity. <hi>Eternity</hi> is defined to be: <hi>The possession
of all good together, and at once;</hi> without any bound terminating it before, or
after, or in any kind. This is the <hi>high place of Eternity,</hi> above all Time,
Change, Succession, or Division. For this reason is our Lord said to be
<hi>Hig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er than the Heavens.</hi> All Created Heavens are below Eternity. They have
M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>sures, and Limits set to the Forms of their Beings, and to their Durations,
which they ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not pass. They are continually rouling thorow successive Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
As the Sealyeth all in Waves: so do the Essences of the most great, and
glorious Creature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> consist of manifold, and various Changes. <hi>Jesus</hi> alone in
His Manhood is ascended to the Height of Eternity above all Changes;
and in this Height of Glory He cometh the <hi>second</hi> time into the World, when
it is said to him; <hi>Thou changest the Heavens, as a Garment, and they are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
But thy throne, O God endureth for ever and ever, Heb.</hi> 1. 8. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:49838:151"/>
So the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> expoundeth Himself in that prayer of His; <hi>Father, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
me with thy self, with that Glory, which I had with thee before the World
was.</hi> The Glory, which <hi>Christ</hi> prayeth for in behalf of His <hi>Humanity,</hi> is a Glory
above the Creation. For it was before the Creation. The Glory of Christ's Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature in the Resurrection from the Dead, is a Glory in Fellowship with
the Father, with Him, who was from the Beginning, an Eternal Glory, a Glory,
which is, when yet the World is not; a Glory, which is the same, while the
World standeth, before which the World is not; a Glory, which is, when the
World is no more. Eternity hath neither Beginning nor End; neither Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
nor Change.</p>
               <p>We may now understand, how <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was with the Father, before
the World was. 1. His <hi>Divinity</hi> was there. For in that He and the Father are
One. 2 His <hi>Humanity</hi> was with the <hi>Father</hi> before the World <hi>Personally,</hi> in
its <hi>prope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>rson.</hi> For the Divinity is the <hi>Person</hi> in the Humanity. 3. The <hi>Soul,</hi>
and <hi>Body</hi> of Christ were there in their <hi>Root,</hi> in their Original, in the Will of
the Father, which is Eternal Love in its unconfined Absoluteness; in the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Father, which is Eternal Beauty in its unlimited Greatness, and
Universal Comprehension. They were also with the <hi>Father</hi> before the World
in their glorified State. For their Glory, which is <hi>Themselves</hi> in Truth, and
Perfection, is Eternal, was before the World was.</p>
               <p>Thus our Saviour in His Glorified Humanity is that <hi>Mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I will now finish my Building, and lay the Top-stone by giving you <hi>three
Representations</hi> of the <hi>Person</hi> of your Beloved with its Beauty in the Resurrect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion;
as his Spiritual Soul, and Spiritual Body stand in the same Glory with their
Spiritual Principle, and Pattern; as they are two distinct Heavens exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
that Heaven, from which they come, it being both their <hi>Mine,</hi> and
their <hi>Mint.</hi> So I shall conclude this <hi>use.</hi>

<hi>Can.</hi> 8. 6. The Spouse prayeth to <hi>Christ: Set me, as a Seal upon thine Heart,
as a Seal upon thine Arm.</hi> The prayers of the Heavenly Bride are made by
the Spirit according to the will of God, and so are always answered. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and Humane Nature are Bridegroom and Bride married together in one
Person. As the Impression of a Seal in Wax hath all its Substance, and Subsistance
in the Wax, is nothing, but what the Wax is in that Form; so the glorified
Soul, and Body of our Blessed Lord stand, as Seals, as Impressions in that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
depth of Love, of Light, of Life, of all Being, which is the Root, and
<hi>Heart</hi> of the God-Head; they stand, as Sealed Impressions on the <hi>Arm</hi> of God;
that is, on every Excellency, every Beauty, every form of Glory, in which
the God-Head with endless variety, with incomprehensible, Sweetness and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
spreadeth forth itself. This is all that, which they are; the unfathomable
Love, and Innumerable Beauties of the Divine Nature in the Forms of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Soul, and a Divine Body.</p>

                  </gap>ng of the <hi>New Heaven, and Earth</hi> telleth
us, that they are turned to the Eternal word, <hi>as Clay to the Seal.</hi> The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of <hi>Christ</hi> in Glory hath the first Model of these in itself. As a Golden
Seal maketh the Impression of itself on Wax, and then fixeth itself unto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
abode in the Impression, which it hath made: so the Eternal Word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printeth
by itself immediately upon its own Soul and Body, a clear, deep, and
full Image of itself in all the Treasures of its Immortal Life, and Blessedness;
uniting itself in its <hi>Divine Substance</hi> to this <hi>Divine Image</hi> most intimately,
most intirely, inseparably. After this manner the Glory, with which the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature of <hi>Christ</hi> is glorified, is the Form, and fulness of the Divine
Nature, in its Purity, unmixt with any other Substance, or Image, in its Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
possessing, comprehending, enjoying itself in each distinct part here,
distinctly, and compleatly.</p>
               <p>The God-Head by its unvailed Presence, and full Appearance, at once fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:49838:152"/>
Bridegroom are three wonderful Temples. The matter of which these
Temples are made is all Spirit of the Eternal Spirit; the Light of Eternal
Life in the Spirit. The fashion of these Buildings is the form of God. All
the Beauties, and varieties of the Essential Wisdom, all the ravishing delights
of the first, the highest, and most universal Harmony in the God-Head, shine
in every part of these living structures. Within is seen the high, and Holy
Trinity with all its deep, dazling, and delightful Mysteries unvailed; all the
Persons appearing in the Lights of their naked, and united Beauties. In the
pure, and transparent brightness of this Supream Glory, which is the <hi>first,</hi> and
the <hi>last,</hi> are seen all things, that ever passed, or are to pass over the Stage of this
Creation from the Beginning to the End with their several Motions, and
Changes; yea, Forms far more innumerable, and greater, than ever were, or
can be seen in this World; the whole compass of Eternity, and Time, as it
cometh down out of Eternity, as it beareth the Figure of it, as it returneth
again; as it lieth in the bosom of Eternity, as it is one piece with it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a Triumphant part of the Divine variety there. All these are seen in the
amiable, and admirable Face of the Trinity within these Temples; as they
are continually rising up out of their Fountain, the Unity of the first, and
most transcendent Love, the Father of all; as they are continually falling
down into this Fountain again; as they are ever playing upon the bosom of
it. All things are seen here, as rich varieties in the Harmony of an entire, and
Immortal Beauty, which comprehendeth all Forms, and hath no bound besides
itself, which sitteth entire, and undivided upon every Form, and Part through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole, which is the only Birth and Image of the Father. All things
are seen here, as they make up one unexpressible Marriage-Joy between this
Love, the Father, the Original, and this Beauty, the Birth, the Son, the Image
by which they both breath forth themselves into one Spirit, the Band, and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
the Inmost Center, and outmost Circle of all Sweetnesses, Graces, Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesses,
Pleasantnesses, Pleasures, Rests, Complacencies, Delights and Joys
thorow Heaven, Earth, Time, Eternity.</p>
               <p>In these three Temples these Things are to be observed, that we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
their Divine Nature, and wonderful make aright.</p>
               <p>1. All three are perfectly distinct in the highest degree of distinction each
from other.</p>
               <p>2. All three perfectly answer, and are alike to one another.</p>
               <p>3. Every one comprehendeth the other Two exactly, and entirely in itself;
that all Three stand together in each several Temple.</p>
               <p>4. All three Temples joyn perfectly into one Temple.</p>
               <p>5. The first Temple is the precious, and living Stone, out of which the
other two grow up into living Temples. It is the Root, the Life, the Substance,
the Form, the Fulness, the perfection, the glory of the other Two.</p>
               <p>I must interpose here <hi>two Cautions</hi> to prevent mistakes.</p>

1. <hi>Cant.</hi> Preserve carefully the <hi>distinction</hi> between Spiritual Things, both
in the <hi>Person</hi> of our Saviour, and in <hi>his Mystical Body.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all Separations, and Divisions <hi>from</hi> God. All breaches upon the Unity of
God are wounds with which Sin pierceth the Prince of Life. The <hi>Spirit</hi>
healeth these breaches. But it preserveth entire all distinctions of things
in God, in the <hi>Divine Unity.</hi> The <hi>God-Head,</hi> the <hi>Manhood,</hi> the <hi>Soul,</hi> the
<hi>Body;</hi> the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Saints;</hi> and of their <hi>Saviour</hi> ever keep their proper
parts in the <hi>variety</hi> to make the Musick of Heaven pleasant. As <hi>Spirituality</hi>
heightneth the <hi>Unity</hi> beyond every Created comprehension, that the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the Glory may be heightned in like manner: so doth it enlarge the
<hi>variety</hi> beyond all finite proportions, that the Marriage-Joy may be more free,
more fresh, more full:</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Cant.</hi> Preserve carefully the <hi>distinction</hi> between <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Creature,</hi>
God is that, which he is <hi>in</hi> himself, and <hi>of</hi> himself. The Creature is that,
which it is by its Union with God. This is the Incommunicable Name of
God; <hi>I am that, which I am.</hi> The name of every Creature on Earth, and in
Heaven is: <hi>I am that, which I am in God; I am that, which God is in me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now made an end of my <hi>third Proposition,</hi> which was this, that <hi>the
Spiritual Body of Christ is to be compared with its Spiritual Principle, and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern.
Jesus</hi> speaketh to this sense in one place. <hi>If they had known the Father,
they would have know me; if they had known me, they would have known you
they.</hi> The Person of the Bridegroom is known aright only by its Pattern, and
in its Principle, which is the <hi>Father,</hi> as he is the brightness of the Fathers Glory,
the express Image of his Substance, and sporteth eternally in his Bosom. The
Person of a Saint is then only seen aright, when it is seen by its Pattern, and
in its Principle, which is the Heavenly Bridegroom; as it is the brightness,
and fulness of him, who shineth thorow, and filleth All in All; the Glory of
<hi>Christ,</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> like the purest Light rejoycing continually in the Bosom of
the Sun.</p>
               <p>I am now arrived at the end of my second Rule; to <hi>compare Spiritual
Things with Spiritual.</hi> And thus I have concluded my present <hi>use,</hi> which is a
<hi>direction</hi> to the knowledge of the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Beauty.</p>
               <p>Use 3. <hi>An exhortation</hi> to Holiness, and Comfort thorow Faith in <hi>Jesus
Christ.</hi> This exhortation is raised upon these <hi>three Grounds,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Ground: The Person of our Lord is unchangeable.</hi> For he is in his true Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
when the Vail is taken off from him, an Eternal Spirit in an Eternal Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<hi>John</hi> 8. 58. He saith of himself; <hi>Before Abraham was, I am. I am,</hi> is
the name of Eternity, and unchangeableness. See how the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
all the Successions, and Distances of Time before <hi>Abraham,</hi> from
<hi>Abraham</hi> to that moment as one, present, sixt, undivided point in himself. As
a Rock standeth firm on the Shore, while Millions of waves rise, and fall at
its foot: such a Rock of glory, and Eternity is our Saviour. While all the

this word come to you, and make in you a hearing Ear. Hear this, you, who
believe not, that you may believe; you, who have Faith, that you may have
it in greater abundance. The same Eye, with which <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> looked upon
you, the same Beauty, in which he beheld you, the same Love, with which
he embraced you in himself in Eternity, before that Sin or the world had
any Being; with the same Eye he now looketh upon thee, in the same Beauty
he now beholdeth thee, with the same Love he now embraceth thee in the
midst of all thy Pilgrimages through so many Darknesses, and Deaths. For
he is unchangeable. All the Waters, all the Fires of Temptations, and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,

Saviour. There every Change lyeth in an Unchangeable Beauty, and Blessedness.
Do variety of Objects with their Changes distract, and divide you, making you
unsetled, and unsafe? Would you be unchangeable in a Holy, and Heavenly
Frame of Heart? Would you be unmoved in the Work, and Joy of the Lord?
Fix your Eye on <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> Abide in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> There you shall <hi>see the

what a beautiful, what a blessed Figure is this? Let us fear none of those
things, that are to come upon us. A Sick-bed, a Prison, a Grave, every change
lieth in the Person of our Beloved as a Mansion cut out of the Rock of Eternity,
in the flourishing Garden of Eden, in the Paradise of the Divine Nature.</p>

to the <hi>Nethermost parts of the Earth, and ascended above all Heavens to this end,
that He might fill All,</hi> Eph. <hi>c. 4. v.</hi> O that I had the tongue of the Learned,
the Learned with the Learning of the Holy! that I could speak to you with
Words taught by the Holy Ghost! O that you had hearts to take in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
more, than I can express! <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> our forerunner is gone into
every Form of things from the Height of the God-Head above to the lowest
Deeps of the Creature to this end, that He might fill every Form of Things
with the Unchangeable Fulness of His own Person, in which All Fulness dwelleth
together in a Spiritual and Divine Body. He hath by this means filled every
point of time with Eternity: every spot of Earth with Heaven; every Change
on Earth, in Time, with the Unchangeableness of Heaven, and Eternity. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> said to his Friends: <hi>This I know, that Bonds await me in every place. But
my life is not dear to me for the Testimony of Jesus.</hi> A Believer in a contrary sense
may say, This I know, that my <hi>Jesus</hi> in the fulness of Unchangeable Loves,
Beauties, and Joys, waiteth for me in every Change; as a Spiritual Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
in a Spiritual Bed of Loves, which is ever green, which hath a Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

and might have a sweet smell. When the Woman in the Gospel poured
forth a Box of pretious Spikenard upon the feet of <hi>Christ;</hi> He said to some,
who were offended with the wast: <hi>Trouble her not. She hath done this against

Incorruptible, Immortal, and Pleasant; Death itself is a Flourishing Life, a

This <hi>Use</hi> hath <hi>Two Parts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Part;</hi> The Opening of the Person of Christ upon us in His Spiritual
Glories sanctifieth and sweetneth this Life. There are <hi>three Principles</hi> of the
Knowledge of <hi>Christ</hi> in His true, and unchangeable State, which will bring
home His Heavenly Beauties warm, and shining to your Hearts on this Earth
by natural Deductions from each Principle.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Principle.</hi> This World in its pure Naturals is the Shadow, which falleth
from the Heavenly Body of Divine Glories in the Person of our Fair One. This
hath been proved at large above. Learn then from this Truth 4. <hi>Lessons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Lesson.</hi> Live unconcerned in this World. This Divine Lesson is taught us
from Heaven by the Holy Ghost upon this Ground; 1. <hi>Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31. But this I
say Brethren, the time is short. It remaineth, that both they that have wives, be, as
though they had none; And they, that wept as though they wept not; and they, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
as though they rejoyced not; and they, that buy, as though they bought not; &amp; they
that use this world, as not abusing it: For the fashion of this world passeth away.</hi> The
<hi>Apostle</hi> here divideth all this World into 4. <hi>Heads;</hi> 1. Relations; 2. Passions; 3. Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions;
4. Employments, and Entertainments. <hi>Solomon</hi> saith in one place; <hi>Why
shouldst thou set thine heart upon that, which is not.</hi> There is no real Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
having a Husband, Wife, or Children, and having none; between being in
Grief, or Joy, and being without Grief, or Joy; between having an
Estate, and having none; between being in the height of all Employments,
or Entertainments, and being out of all. This world hath nothing real. It is
all a Shadow. Seeing then the various States of things on Earth have no real
Difference; pass thou thorow all estates with a perfect indifference of Spirit,
in a constant calm. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1. This is an Expression of the Vanity, of
all things here; <hi>One Generation goeth, another cometh but the Earth standeth
for ever.</hi> The Scripture in several places makes this one of the Names of God,
<hi>The Earth; the Ground,</hi> out of which all Generations of Things arise, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they return again. Divines interpret, that <hi>Land of the Living</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
to be the Divine Nature. In this let our Spirits be a Divine Earth stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for ever unmoved upon its own Center of Eternity, while one change
after another cometh, and passeth away again. The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> presseth it upon
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:49838:155"/>
us by <hi>three Arguments.</hi> 1. This World is a Fashion, a Figure only, a Shadow.
The <hi>fashion of this world.</hi> In having this world thou hast a Shadow. The
Substance is above. Let the world in having thee have thy shadow only. Let
thine heart be in Heaven with <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> 2. This world vanisheth, as a
shadow. <hi>The fashion of this world passeth away.</hi> The Colours in a Rain-bow
are Appearances of Colours, and no more, made by the reflection of the Sun
upon a dark, and watery Cloud. So they suddenly break up, and are seen no
more. The Colours of a Flower upon its stalk in the Garden are real, liv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>g,
and lasting. Such is the difference between Things on Earth, and Things in
Heaven. Nothing here hath either Substance, or Root. 3. This world is a
flying shadow suddenly gone. <hi>The time is short.</hi> As the shadow upon a Dyal
in a short Winter-day moveth swiftly, passeth away presently, the Sun being
low, and immediately going in, or going down: so is every condition, every
comfort in Flesh. This is the <hi>first Lesson.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Lesson:</hi> Live without care, and with content. <hi>Let your moderation be
known unto all men. The Lord is at hand. Be careful for nothing: but in every
thing by Prayer, and supplication with Thansgiving let your requests be made
known unto God, Phil.</hi> 4. 5, 6. You have in these words. 1. <hi>A Precept</hi> for
moderation. Moderation is that measure of Things, by which they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned,
and tuned each to other, so as to fall in, and agree in one. This is
that which maketh Beauty in Sights, and Musick in Sounds. A contented
frame, composed, and equal motions are the Beauty, and Musick of your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
2. <hi>The Reason</hi> of this Precept followeth; <hi>The Lord is at hand,</hi> is near:
nothing will so quiet the Soul, and bring it to rest in every Appearance of
things here so, as a right sence of the near, and immediate presence of the
Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in Glory with all these things, after the same manner, in which
the Body, or Substance is present with its proper Shadow. The Body is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with the Shadow <hi>four ways;</hi> as sending it forth immediately from itself,
and keeping it hanging upon itself by an immediate touch, and union every
moment; as governing all its motions by its own Acts, and Operations in itself;
by its own Appearance there in its Figure, and Similitude; by its Approach,
and Readiness to break up the Shadow by its breakings forth thorow it. Canst
thou think that thy beloved in the sweet shinings of his Beauty, in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
actings of the Divine Life, in the pleasant motions, and mysterious opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Love, is thus near to every Creature, every Providence; and not
answer this Beauty with the Beautiful smile of a contented mind, this Musick
with the melody of a well-pleased, and harmonious temper of Spirit: many
that were sick, were healed by the shadow of St. <hi>Peter</hi> overspreading them,
as he passed by. When thou art sick with discontent for any passage of things
in this world, submit thy self to it, as the shadow of thy dearest Lord, with
which he overspreadeth thee from his own Blessed Person, being himself ever
at hand there, where his shadow is; figuring himself with his own Divine
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49838:155"/>
Motions, and Operations upon it; being even now ready to disclose himself
thorow it, as the Rose breaking out of the Bud. Lie down under every acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as such a Divine Shadow of this Divine Lover with his Love; and thou
wilt find thy self healed of thy sickness of Mind, of every Grief, and Melancholy.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>A third Thing</hi> in this Scripture alledged is a <hi>Prohibition</hi> of Care. Be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in nothing. Care is a Sin universally, in the greatest things, as well as the
least; in the highest things, as well as in the lowest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But you will say, what Care is that, which is Sin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer; that Care is a Sin, which breaketh the moderation of your
Spirits, which defaceth the Spiritual Beauty, which disturbeth the Spiritual
Musick of a well-pleased, and contented<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mind in you; which putteth your
Spirits out of tune, cloudeth the clearness, disordereth the Harmony of your
Spirits, distempering them, and making them to jar with discontent. Again
that care is sinful, which is contrary to this Three-fold sense of the presence
of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> with every Creature, and Occurrence on the Earth, as with
his own Shadow; his Powerful Presence giving it Being, and Motion from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
fastning it immediately to himself; his Beautiful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Presence imprinting the
Likeness, and Image of himself upon it; his Love-Presence calling the Soul
to himself by it, coming down to meet, and embrace the Soul there, ready to
set himself in the place of his Shadow, making that the mark, and forerunner of
his Person, and Loves in their full Light and Heat.</p>
               <p>4. In the <hi>last</hi> place the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> that skilful Apothecary prescribeth a
<hi>Cordial</hi> to preserve you from this trembling of the Heart, from carefulness.
This Cordial is made up of six precious Ingredients.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Ingred. Prayer. With Prayer.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

much: stand not at a distance; tarry not without. Come boldly up to the
Throne of Grace, to God in the purest, and most raised heights of his Glory,
and Love; to Love, as it is seated upon its highest, and most glorious Throne,
the Heart of God; to love, as it shineth with its sweetest smiles in the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
unvailed, and naked. Enter boldly within the Vail, behold God Face to
Face, so talk familiarly with him, as a Friend doth with his Friend. Like the
beloved Disciple, lay thine head in his Bosom, so speak to him, as a Bride to her
Bridegroom.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Ingred. Supplication. By Prayer, and Supplication; v.</hi> 6. The word
rendred <hi>Supplication,</hi> signifieth in its root three things, <hi>Want, a Band, Decency,</hi>
or <hi>Harmony.</hi> Have a Divine sense of thine own Shadowiness, and Vanity
upon every want which thou feelest. Go by a Divine Power, and in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

                  <hi>Moses</hi> ascending upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> passed thorow the clouds, and fires; so

Subsistence in the flame of the Spirit, Lose thine own Life, and Form in the

Again O Believing Soul in this Sight, in this Sense, in the vertue of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Descents, return, and spread thy self by all these Lines of Glory together
with thy God into the Circle of Eternity. There comprehend All, thy self,

Enemies, or oppositions in thy Affairs, which are apt to perplex thee, and fill

open the Eye of the Spirit. Then look again, and see the Chariots of fire, and
Horses of fire, a Spiritual fire shining with Glory, burning with Love, refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

Cordial; <hi>The Lord being at hand. v.</hi> 5. The Philosopher in a Mill seeing his
Friends making a doubt of coming in to him there, out of a disesteem of the
place, and of him for being found in that place, invited them in with these
words; here also are the immortal Gods. When thou feelest thine heart stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

cares in any condition for the troubles of it, say to thine heart after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
here also is my <hi>Jesus</hi> with all his Train of Immortal Glories, Loves, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and Spirits. Here he is in a Figure of himself. Here is he in Person
under this Figure. Here he is ready to shine forth, and appear glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.
This is his Shadow; This Shadow is his Tabernacle, in which he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

world. For this world is the Temple of God, in as much, as it is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
in a Shadow. <hi>For the Invisible things of him from the Creation of the World
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his Eternal
Power, and God-Head, Rom.</hi> 1. 20. Four things make a Temple. 1. <hi>A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

2. <hi>A Divine Pattern.</hi> The Invisible things of the God-Head, of the Lord
<hi>Jesus</hi> the power of the God-Head, of Eternity are figured upon this World.
3. <hi>A Divine End.</hi> The proper end of these Figures is to form notions of the
Divine nature upon our minds, to lead us to converse with it, to bring us into
the Participations of it, that it may enjoy itself in the reflections of its own
excellencies, and Glories from us; <hi>v. 21. When they knew God, they glorified him

               <p>In what a Calm, in what Serenity, in what Purity, with what Beauty should

who tast, take in, and feel the pure, the primitive Life of all Sweetness,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49838:157"/>
and Joy in the Glory, the God-Head itself inhabiting every part and point,
every passage, motion of Things in this whole Creation, as in a Temple. How
would our Persons, and lives shine with a spiritual Lustre; how sweet would
the Musick of our Spirits, and Conversation be, if we did thus take up, and
bear this Natural Image, as the Tabernacle, and the Star of our God, our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

in Eternity. All objects, all actions in the Temple, the Beasts, the cutting

Divine and Immortal Glories, to which the Musick of the Levites round about

Peace; Joy, and Grief; Light, and Darkness; Weeping, with Howlings,
Laughter with Shouts; Life, and Death with all that is delightful, or dismal
belonging to them; all these Heavenly, and Divine Mysteries. Every one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
to a purpose in the Heart of God, to a Pattern in the Eternal, and
Essential Form of God. Every one answereth to the Musick of the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
which stand in Quires in the uppermost parts of this Creation, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
upon the walls of the Temple. The basest, the bloodiest Persons, and
Offices; those that kill, and those that are killed, bear the Figure of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
like the Beasts for Sacrifice, or the Sacrificing Priests in their linnen Garments
stained with Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Every thing is beautiful in his Time.</hi> The Time of every thing is Divinely
set; by a Divine Pattern, in a Divine Proportion; by a Divine Power. Thus
each thing is cloathed with a double Beauty. 1. The Divine Harmony of the
Universal Image in Nature, resulting from, and resting upon each particular
fitly set with a sacred proportion, and contrivance in its own Time, and in
his Time, that is, by a Divine Hand in a Divine Time. 2. An exact, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing
Harmony with the Eternal Image of the supream Glories in God. As
line for line, feature for feature, colour for colour, motion for motion from a
Face in a Glass answer to the Beautiful Face, which beholdeth itself in the
Glass; so is God, and this world; the Face in the water, and the living Face;
Beauty itself, by looking upon the water, at once Figuring itself upon it, and

that may be applied here. The work of God in this World, and Time,
is for Heaven, and Eternity, to be understood, and enjoyed there. When we
shall come into the presence of the Life, and the Original, then shall we look
again with another manner of Eye upon the Picture, and have an unexpress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pleasure to behold one in the other. As the Tabernacle, when its season
was past, was taken into the Temple. So when Time, and this world are past
away, Time, and this world from the Beginning to the End shall be taken up
into their first Patterns, into Eternity. God shall call every thing to the least
dust, or moment by its name, and no one shall be wanting. There shalt thou
see the Beauty of the whole, and of every part in the light, and life of its
Glorious Original. Then shalt thou know, what God hath done from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the world to the End. Thou shalt now possess, and enjoy all with
unexpressible pleasures, when thou shalt thus meet them again in a new Light,
to be for ever with thee.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, as <hi>Christ</hi> said to <hi>Martha: Believe, and thou shalt see the

dwelt (tabernacled) among us; (and we beheld his Glory, the Glory, as of the
only begotten of the Father,) full of Grace, and Truth.</hi> O Man, O Christian,
open the Eye of thy understanding, open the Eye of thy Faith; see this world
the Tabernacle, the Temple of the Eternal Word; behold all things full of
the Grace, and Glory of his Person in Shadows, and Images formed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
behold himself in the truth of all this Grace, and Glory; in that height
of Glory, which is proper to his own Person, as he is the only begotten of the
Father, dwelling with thee in this Temple, behind the Vail of every Shadow
and Image. Behave thy self, as in the House of God. Walk in the midst of
all Creatures, and Occurrences, as in the midst of so many Divine Mysteries;
as a Priest in the Temple. In purity, in peace, in wisdom, in love, bear in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
state the Figure of thy Jesus, and his Glories; converse with it in every
thing; walk in it at all times. See thy Glorified Jesus himself together with
his shadow; make him the mark of thine Eye, and thine Heart; terminate all
the workings of thy Spirit upon him, as the Truth, and Substance. So wait
continually for the breakings forth of the glory, as a Heavenly Flame thorow
the Shadow upon thee, to take thee up into itself. And thou, as thou ascendest,
carry up the Shadow with thee.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Lesson.</hi> Live abstracted from this world in the world. Distinguish, and
separate thy self from the Natural Person, Life, and Image, which are all the

Shadow, and no more; that thou mayst stand in an Immortal Person, a Life
of Glory, the Essential Image, which is the Truth. The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> saith: <hi>I tell

Comforter will not come unto you: but, if I depart, I will send Him to you, Joh.

Jesus Christ in the Substance, in the Spirit, is the Comforter, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.
How expedient is it for us in the midst of these Shadows to withdraw

               <p>All Shadows are under the Law. The Law hath Shadows only of Good

               <p>How wise, how blessed is he, who gathereth himself up entirely out of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

to be Shadows only, Shadows of Immortal Joys, and Himself already in those
Joys, triumphing over, and comprehending those Shadows in the Beautiful,
and Blessed Truth, These are the <hi>Lessons</hi> from the <hi>First Principle;</hi> which was,
that this World in its pure Naturals falleth as a Shadow from the Glorified
Person of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Principle.</hi> The Presence, and Appearance of the Person of our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi>
and His Glory, is withdrawn from the faln, and corrupt World. The Devil is
called in the Scriptures, <hi>The Prince of Darkness;</hi> and <hi>The Prince of this World.
This</hi> World, the World in this faln state is <hi>Darkness.</hi> Darkness is the Privation
of Light. The absence of the Sun from the Earth is the Cause of Darkness. Our
Saviour in Glory is the Light, the Sun of the whole Creation. While He goeth
away with His Beams into a far countrey, to shine in the Invisible World,
He leaveth all behind Him in the Dark. <hi>Three Lessons</hi> naturally flow from this
<hi>second Principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Lesson.</hi> Believe not any Appearances of things in this World. Darkness
in the language of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> signifieth Deceit. The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> saith of
Himself; <hi>I am the Truth,</hi> Truth hath lest the World together with <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
Blessed is he, who having the Possessions, or Powers of this World in his Hand;
the Smile, or Frowns of it before his Eyes; the Griefs, or Joys of it in his
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:49838:159"/>
Heart; can with a good assurance say: Have I not a Lye in my Hand, and in
my Heart? Are not the Apparitions of the Devil the Father of Lyes before
me?</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Lesson.</hi> Love not the things of this World, <hi>James. 4. 4. Ye adulterers
and Adulteresses, know ye not, that the Friendship of this World, is enmity with
God.</hi> It is not now the Seed of the Woman, which is a Divine Loveliness, and
Love in the Person of our Heavenly Bridegroom, which springeth up in all
the Forms, and Fruits of this World. <hi>Yet a little while,</hi> saith He to the World,
<hi>and ye shall see me no more.</hi> No! It is the Seed of the Serpent in Deformity, and
Enmity; in a Contrariety to all Spiritual Beauty Goodness, and Truth, which
groweth up every where. Your Love to any part of this World is Unclean,
and Adulterous: By it you leave the pure, and sweet embraces of your own
Glorious Husband to ly down infolded in the treacherous Twinings of the old
Serpent, the Dragon.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Lesson.</hi> Walk not after the Fashion of this World, <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Be not
conformed to this World.</hi> While the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> was with this World, it was,
His Shadow. He figured His Beauties upon it; He acted it with His Spirit;
His Name was as an Ointment poured out upon it; He spake to us and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with us there: But now, when He is absent, the beautiful Figure is gone,
the Darkness with all its confusions, and cursed Fruits remain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Spirit of
Darkness ariseth in it with all his, Hellish Forms of Deceit, Defilement, and
Wrath; If thou cloath thy Spirit with any Worldly Image, thou puttest on a

things into One, hath made all things New with the Spiritual, and Eternal
Glory of the Father; as the World standeth in the Resurrection of <hi>Christ</hi>
from the Dead, and in His Glorified Person, as a New Head to it with a New
Name.</p>

it must be Love itself in a Lovely Form. Every thing, that toucheth

Love. Otherwise there would be a Separation between Love, and thee.</p>
               <p>In thy glorified <hi>Jesus</hi> is the Love of God, that Love, which is God, the God-Head
of Love. O blessed Habitation! O Happy, and Heavenly Countrey!

you; it is no more. The old things, of Vanity, Darkness, Sin, Sorrow
Death are passed away in His Death. Thus you are conquerours. But in His
Resurrection the World is raised again in a Form of Eternal Love, and Glory
for you. All things are come again, and are made New, All things appear
again the second time Immortal Spirits shining in the Loveliness, burning in
the Love of the God-Head for you; opening all things past, present, and to

A Believer is compleat in his Saviour, as He hath the Compleatness of the

him a Divine Figure standing in the Resurrection from the Dead. His
Death is a Flower of Life, and Immortality growing up in the Paradise of
God, which is the Glorified Person of <hi>Jesus.</hi> It beareth indeed the Figure of
Death, but is full of a Sweetness, and Beauty, which can never fade, or dye.
Let us all labour for our part in the New Birth. This is a Resurrection from
the Dead. All things after it are Life; Pure Life without any mixture of
Death; Perpetual Life, Endless Life without any Sting of Death in the tail of it.</p>

<hi>Supercoelestial,</hi> more than <hi>Heavenly</hi> places, <hi>above the Heavens.</hi> Here
a Saint is made <hi>to sit down.</hi> He is fixed, and established; He is at rest, at home,
at the end of all his journeyings, and changes. He is set as a Bride, at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-feast.
He is set, as a Prince upon the Throne of his Kingdom. Thus
God giveth His Beloved Sleep, Rest, a Feast, a Throne in Death, <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
in Glory is this Sleep, this Rest, this Feast, this Throne, which endureth for
ever, and ever. O Christian! rejoyce, and glory in Death for the Hope of
the Joy, and Glory of thy Bridegroom there. Thy Death hath nothing of
Dust, or Darkness in it. It is a Heavenly Thing, nay more than Heavenly. It
is something Supercoelestial. It is a soft Strain, and ravishing Touch in the
Musick of the Divine, and Eternal Rest. It is a savoury Dish, such, as thy
soul loveth, at the Feast in the Kingdom of God. Solomon had a throne of
Gold. On the Steps, which were the Ascents to the Throne, on each side were
Lyons of pure Gold. Thy Death, O Saint, is now no more a fierce, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
Lyon to affright thee. It is the figure of a Lyon in Gold, in one Glory.

3. <hi>Pos.</hi> A Saint is set down in Heavenly places together with <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
The sweetning, and the heightning of all the Joys, and Glories of the Gospel
is the Union with thy Beloved Bridegroom. The work of Grace is a Birth,
a Resurrection, a Marriage, all in one. The Death of a Saint is an Act of
Spiritual Communion between Christ, and the Soul; a Marriage-Joy. The
Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> presenteth himself to the Believer in the Form of Death, as in a
Heavenly, a Supercoel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stial Beauty. At this sight the Saint is immediately trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into the same Image. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> springeth up into the Believer, a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
springeth up into his Beloved in this Heavenly Form. So both are made
one in it. Thus Death becometh a Love-play between Christ, and his Spouse,
He by a Spiritual Kiss breatheth forth his Spirit of Divine Loves, Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Invisible Glories into the Spouse. The Spouse ravished sorth from her
self again in the same moment breatheth forth her Spirit into the Bosom of
her Lord. Thus they die together, they die one in another, they die one into
another.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>first</hi> of the <hi>Canticles</hi> there is a Prophetical Song, which beginneth
at the Resurrection of our Saviour, and the Effusion of the Spirit, together
with the Spiritual Union between <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Church, which was, as
their Heavenly Espousals solemnized, and sealed with a Kiss, with the reiterated
<hi>Kisses of his Mouth.</hi> Then followeth in the process of the first Chapter, and
beginning of the Second, the Loveliness of the Spouse, and the Love between
her, and the Heavenly Bridegroom in her Sufferings, and Death, as they are
acted upon the Stage, in the glorious Scene of the Resurrection, and Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the State of Espousals, and in their Union in one Spirit.
The dying Spouse there singeth to her Lord; <hi>Behold! thou art fair, my Love,
yea thou art pleasant; also our Bed is green, v. 16. Jesus Christ</hi> is fair to a Saint
Eye in his Divine Loveliness being risen up into the Glory of the Father. He
is pleasant to her in his Loves, which are his Loveliness in Motion, acting
beautiful parts; transforming itself into delightful Shapes with endless variety;
in all pouring forth itself into her Bosom, taking her up into itself with Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Changes of one into another. The Unity of the Spirit is the Bed of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Loves, which is ever green, that is, as the word importeth, ever encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
with a Heavenly Calm, and Serenity, ever flourishing, ever fruitful.
Death itself is the mutual embracing of these two Heavenly Lovers in this
Bed of Spiritual Loves in the midst of a Divine calm, and clearness; while out
of these embraces they spring up into innumerable Forms of Eternal Beauties,
and Joys, which are the flourishing Fruits, and Blessed Children of this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Union.</p>
               <p>It is said, that <hi>nothing was made without Christ,</hi> (apart from <hi>Christ) that
was made in the Creation, John</hi> 1. 2. Remember, O Christian, that in the new
Creature thou art, thou sufferest, thou doest nothing, in life, or in death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
thy <hi>Jesus</hi> in Glory, apart from thy <hi>Jesus</hi> in the Unity of his Spirit, which
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:49838:161"/>
is the Center, and Circle of all Blessed Spirits, with all the Train, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Divine Nature. While thou livest, all the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Spirits, Innumerable Angels live with thee thy life. All these, all the
Lights, and Loves of the Supercoelestial State die with thee thy Death.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Pos.</hi> All this Resurrection, Ascension into the Heavenly places, Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of a Believer with <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>in Christ. He hath raised us together, and
hath made us sit together in Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus.</hi> See now those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
above the Heavens, those more than Heavenly Things in the midst of which
a Saint is set. They are all in the glorified Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> who is made higher
than the Heavens.</p>
               <p>The Learned tell us, that there are three Worlds. 1. This, which is visible.
2. The Angelical World. 3. The Divine World. All things of the upper,
and greater Worlds are in the lower, as in the Seed. All Things of the lower
are in the Superiour, as ripe Fruit. Every thing is in each according to the
nature of that place. Behold! This is the Divine World the Person of our
Lord, and Love ascended up on high above all Heavens of Angels. Here
in him the Fulness of the God-Head dwelleth Bodily; that is, not shadowily,
or seminally; in its Shadow, or Seed; but in its Substance, and Perfection.
While here thou standest fast in this thy <hi>Jesus,</hi> thine own proper habitation,
Death itself is an Angel; nay more, it appeareth in a Divine Form, is become
a Divine Glory, a rich and ravishing piece of variety in the Unity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature. In the World of Angels every thing is a distinct Angel. In the
Divine World all things are cloathed with the form of God.</p>
               <p>As a Child lying in its Mothers lap, a branch from the Mother bearing her
Image, with its mouth at the Breast, looking upon her Face, falling asleep in
her Bosom; yet not so sleeping, but that still it sucketh as it sleepeth: such is
a Saint dying in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> He lieth in the lap of the Supream Glory en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassing
him on every side, and bearing him, as its own Birth, and Image.
His mouth is at the breast of this Glory. His Eye is upon the Face of this
Glory. He sleepeth in its Bosom. But it is a Divine sleep. While he sleepeth,
he is awake, and keepeth his Eye still upon the Glory, and sucketh in the
Glory still in Death. We have this excellently represented in one place by the
Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> where the Heavenly <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> (which is our <hi>Jesus</hi> in the
Spirit,) is said <hi>to bear her Children on her sides, and to dandle them on her Knee.</hi>
In another place they are said, <hi>to walk in the Light of the new Hierusalem</hi>
These Dandlings, and Dancings in the Arms of that Glory, which is our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
our Father, and our Husband, our Heavenly <hi>Jesus;</hi> such walks in its
sweet, and living Light are all the Motions, and Changes of Life, and Death
to those, that are in <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall conclude my Observations from this Scripture with the difference
between the Death of a Man standing in the Root of the First <hi>Adam,</hi> and a

of God. I have done now with the <hi>first Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Script. Verily, verily I say unto you, except a Corn of Wheat fall into the

John</hi> 12. 24. These are the words of our Saviour concerning himself upon
a report made to him hy <hi>Philip,</hi> that some <hi>Greeks</hi> desired to see him. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of <hi>Jesus</hi> is partly to raise them from a Carnal view of him on Earth to a
Spiritual sight of him in a Heavenly Glory after Death, partly to signify the
difference between his State of humiliation in this Life, where he is single and
Barren in the Flesh; and his State of exaltation after Death, where he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

up an Universal Person reconciling, comprehending All in the Unity of the
Spirit; a Fruitful Person being a new head, and root in the Love, Life, and
Glory of the Father to all Mankind, Jews, and Gentiles; to all Creatures.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour, while he lived, was, as a single, naked grain of Wheat. But
when he sprung up out of the Grave, he became a pleasant, and flourishing
Plant bearing much Fruit, many grains of Wheat in one Ear; many, all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
all Angels, and Spirits in Glory, in that one, his own Person, and Spirit.
He was in the Flesh, as one Rose, one Apple pull'd off the Tree. He is in the
Spirit, as the Rose-Tree, the Apple-Tree. All Angels and Saints, all Forms of
Things are glorified in his Glory; all in Heavenly, and Immortal Persons are
in his Heavenly Person, as full-blown Roses growing upon the Rose-Tree, as
full-ripe Apples upon the Apple-Tree.</p>
               <p>The Death of a Saint is upon this ground made most beautiful, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant;

Fruit was sweet to my taste.</hi> There are three distinct parts in the <hi>Hebrew; 1.
I desired, and sweetly delighted in his Shadow. 2. Then I sate down. 3. And his
Fruit was sweet to my taste.</hi> The <hi>Apple</hi> in Holy Scriptures and in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Learned Authors is famous for a pleasant Cordial nourishment of
Life; and for an Emblem of Love. You may see this in this <hi>Chapter. v. 5.
Stay me with Flagons, comfort me with Apples; for I am sick of Love. Apples</hi>
are Emblems of Love for their pleasant looks to the Eye, their fragrant smell,
their delightful tast, their cordial vertue, their round form, which is a Figure
of Unity, the Root and Sap, and Fruit of all Love.</p>
               <p>In the midst of the Wood of this Life, where all Forms of things are like
blasted, and barren Trees, good neither for Shade, nor Fruit, <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ
standeth, as an Apple-Tree, a Tree of Life, and a Tree of Love, Fair, Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
and Fruitful.</p>

When the poor Spouse of <hi>Christ</hi> thorow all this Life is wearied with scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Heats, sounding Tempests, raging Storms, then her Beloved, when He

               <p>1. The <hi>Place</hi> of Blessed Spirits after this Life. It is, saith <hi>Christ,</hi> my <hi>Father's
House.</hi> The House of the Father is the Glorified-Person of His Son. This is the
Temple of God in Heaven, the Palace of the great King. <hi>In Him the fulness of
the God-Head dwelleth bodily.</hi> All glorious Persons, Angels, Saints, and Spirits, as
they are comprehended in the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> and make up His Body, the
Divine Body, the Body of Glories, and Eternity in Him, as they are Beautiful
Members in that Body, so are they Mansions in that Temple, Apartments in

with all the Persons, Prospects, Furniture, Entertainments of the whole with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               <p>2. The <hi>Preparation</hi> of this Place. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you.</hi> While this
Palace of Eternity with all its Apartments, which are also its Inhabitants the
Glorified, and Immortal Persons of all Saints, stood in the Father, in the Divine
Nature alone; it was hid from the Eye of every Creature, it was shut up, that
none could enter into it, it was remote from every Creature at a very great
distance. The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> by His Death, and Resurrection entring with the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature into this Eternal Habitation, hath set it up in the Nature of
Man, hath brought it near to us, hath set it in our view, hath set it open for us.
The Gates of this Temple, of this Heavenly <hi>Hierusalem</hi> stand open day, and
night to all quarters of the Heaven, and the Earth. All the Apartements of it
with our several Names written upon them, our several Persons in Glory ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in them, stand ready. The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> Himself is the Beautiful Gate,
the Living Way, the Ascent, the rich Stair-case to this Temple. The Angels
are continually descending in Him as Chariots, to bring down riding upon
them our glorious Saviour, and our glorious Selves into the Bosom of our
Spirits here below. The Bridegroom, and the Bride ready trimm'd, and already
joyned in One, come thus down out of Heaven, come thus forth from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The Angels are continually ascending by this Stair-case carrying up our
Spirits beforehand on visits into this Palace, into our own Apartments, into
the Bosom of our own Glorified, and Immortal Substances there. Every Grace,
every Providence, every Motion of things, to him whose Eyes are opened, is
such an Angel such a chariot of Angels with these Persons riding in it.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Passage</hi> into this Place. <hi>I will come unto you, and take you unto my
self, that where I am, there ye may be also.</hi> There are three Steps of Christ's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to us in Glory; 1. Into our whole Spirits by Regeneration; 2. Into our
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49838:163"/>
whole Souls at death. 3. Into our whole Persons, Spirit, Soul and Body at the
Resurrection. By every step he maketh a mutual Union, so far as he goeth.
He cometh to us; He taketh us to himself, that we may be both together in
one place, in one Spirit. He letteth himself down in his Heavenly
Palace into us; he taketh us up into the Heavenly Palace in himself; he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
our Persons a Heavenly Palace like his glorified Person, and one with it.</p>
               <p>This is our passage in Death into Glory. Of old God descended upon the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
in a Cloud, &amp; the Glory was in the Cloud. Then <hi>Moses</hi> was summoned to
enter into the Cloud, and so into the Glory; where God talked with him. In latter
times the most excellent Majesty in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Cloud overshadowed the Lord Jesus,
and in overshadowing him transfigured him, then in the transfiguration talked
to him of his Sonship to the Father, and of Love. In like manner at the set time
the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> as a living Temple of Heavenly Glory, cometh down upon
thee in a white Cloud of some Love-storm, or Love-sickness. I call it a <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sickness,</hi>
because it ariseth at once from the Love of the Spirit of the Bride in
thee, and from the Love of thy Bridegroom to thee; from the longings, and
burning desires of both after the immediate, perpetual, and full enjoyments
of each other: As thou entrest into this Cloud, and art overshadowed by it,
thou art in a moment, at the same time taken into that Palace of Glory, and
transfigured into the Glory of that Pallace. There thou appearest to be the
Son of God, the Spouse of the Immortal King. God speaketh to thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseth
with thee, as a Son, and Spouse in one. He seeth the Figure of his own
Beauties in thy Face; and his Heart resteth in thy Bosom. He seeth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth
thy Person, as springing up eternally with incomprehensible Pleasures
out of the Root of his own Divine Loveliness; he feeleth, and rellisheth
thy Spirit, as the flowing of his own sweetnesses from their own Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in himself; he poureth forth himself in a flood of Beauties, and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
into thee, All his Loves rest in thy Love, and he in thee.</p>
               <p>4. Script. <hi>I am now come to the</hi> last Scripture. For we know, that if our
Earthly House of this Tabernacle be dissolved, we have a Building of God, an
House not made with hands, Eternal in the Heavens. For in this we groan, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
desiring to be cloathed upon with our House, which is from Heaven. If so
he, that being cloathed, we shall not be found naked. For we, that are in this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
do groan, being burthened; not that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed
upon, that Mortality might be swallowed up of Life. Now he, that hath wrought
us for this self-same thing is God, who hath also given us the Earnest of the Spirit.
2 Cor. 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>This is a rich, and deep Scripture. What expressions of Death are those?
How full of Joy? <hi>Not to be found naked?</hi> Naked of any support, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort?
Of any cloathing of Being, or Beauty; Essence, or Substance; Form,
or Fulness, in Person, or Relations? <hi>Not to be uncloathed?</hi> Of any Garment
of Light, or Life? <hi>To be cloathed upon with an House from Heaven?</hi> To have
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:49838:163"/>
the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> as a circling Glory coming down upon this Image, in which
we now dwell, neither taking away the Nature, nor Form of any thing, that
here we are, or have, but taking up all as sacred Mysteries into a Temple of
Glory, giving them a place for ever in this Temple, penetrating, filling, and
cloathing them the Glory? <hi>To have Mortality swallowed up of Life?</hi> To lose
none of the things, or entertainments, which here we enjoy in this mortal
state, but the mortality of them only, and that not by Death breaking them
down with violence, but by the sweet breakings in of Life, and Immortality
upon them; not by a blackness of Darkness dreadfully over-spreading them,
but a brightness of Eternal Glory delightfully rising upon them, like the Sun
upon the beautiful Forms of Heaven, and Earth, after they have weakly
appeared in the melancholy Beams of the Moon shining faintly in the shade
of the Night. <hi>And He that hath wrought us for the Self-same Thing, is God.</hi>
It is a Divine Hand, and Skill, which hath framed, and fashioned us to this
capacity. It is God, who by his own operations in us, not mediately, as in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
works of Nature, but immediately, as in all works of Grace, and Glory, hath
wrought out this Spiritual, and Divine Being, this Spiritual, and Divine Nature
in us, which never dyeth, but is changed from Glory to Glory; which in
Death putteth off nothing, but putteth on a greater, and purer Light upon its
weaker Lights, and Shades; piercing thorow, and breaking up delusive Shapes
formed out of the Darkness of remaining night by stronger Beams of Glory fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from above. <hi>Who hath also given us the Earnest of his Spirit.</hi> An <hi>Earnest</hi> is part
of the Sum in present, and an assurance of the rest. God doth not only frame a
Spiritual work, like a new Heaven in us, but giveth us the Person of his Spirit
himself, in which the Persons of the Father, and the Son are seen together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in their Union, and Communion of Beauties, and Loves; in the unity of
which all Angels and Blessed Spirits dwell together, as their proper Center, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
This Spirit God giveth to be in the Spiritual Nature framed by himself in us, as
a new Sun in the new Heaven. This Spirit in us is the <hi>Earnest</hi> of our Death; a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tast
of its Sweetness, and Delights; a vision in part beforehand of the manner of
our dying; and an assurance of the compleating of its season after the same Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and pleasant Image. As at the first Effusion of the Spirit upon us, or any
new Effusion; as at any Act of the Spirit, when he shineth our freshly in us;
this Natural Image of Things is no more; a Light of Glory, Forms of Glory
Immortal Spirits full of a Divine Beauty, and Majesty appear every where.
They are alone, and there is nothing besides in the whole space of Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
or below, past, present, or to come. As they are, so are we. All Things are
one Vision of Divine Glory. Neither do we perceive, how one Image of
Things goeth, and another cometh. Both are done; one is come, the other is
gone in the same moment, in the twinkling, or cast of an Eye. So is Death.
This is the Earnest of our Death. This is a step of Death; a foretast of it. So
shall Death he perfected us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:49838:164"/>
I have three Observations to make upon this Scripture besides that, which I
have already said in order to my present purpose; to shew how the knowledge
of Christ in Glory sanctifieth, and sweetneth Death.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Obser.</hi> Here are three distinct Frames. 1. <hi>A Building.</hi> v. 1. 2. <hi>A
Tabernacle.</hi> v. 1. v. 4. Where take notice, that in both places it is translated
<hi>this Tabernacle;</hi> but is in Greek, <hi>the Tabernacle. 3. The Earthly House.</hi> v. 1.</p>
               <p>This seemeth to allude to <hi>the Temple,</hi> which was a standing, stately Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
set up by <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Kingdom of the Jews; to <hi>the Tabernacle</hi> in the
Wilderness, which was less, and moveable but rich and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine for the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,
and for the Materials; to <hi>the Tent</hi> of course stuff, a covering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or the
Tabernacle. All these were Figures of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Church, to which they
are also applied.</p>
               <p>1. The Heavenly Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> as it standeth in the high and holy place
of Eternity; as it springeth up out of the Bosom of the Father, and abideth
in his Bosom; as it is one Spirit, and one Glory with the Father, is the <hi>Temple,</hi>
the <hi>Building.</hi> For the <hi>Building</hi> hath this Three-fold Character; 1. It is <hi>of God,</hi>
in Greek <hi>out of God,</hi> as Gold is <hi>out of</hi> a Mine of Gold. 2. It is <hi>Eternal;</hi> 3.
It is <hi>in the Heavens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Glorified Person of every Saint, as it is comprehended in this Glorious
Head of all Saints, is a <hi>Temple,</hi> a <hi>Building</hi> in Heaven, in Eternity, of the
same manner, and fashion.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> made of Sky-colour, of Scarlet, of Purple, of fine Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
with Silver, and Gold, and all manner of precious stones, wrought with
Cherubims, and all curious Workmanship, is the Image of God in <hi>Christ,</hi> and
a Saint here below in the Wilderness of this World. <hi>John 1. 14. And the
Word was made Flesh, and dwelt</hi> (in Greek <hi>Tabernacled) among us, and we
beheld his Glory, the Glory, as of the onely Begotten Son of God; full of Grace,
and Truth.</hi> Here you have the <hi>Temple,</hi> which is higher, greater in compass,
and more glorious than the Heavens, contracting itself into a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi>
and residing in that Tabernacle, filling it with its own Sweetnesses and Glories,
which are <hi>Grace,</hi> opposed to Wrath, <hi>Truth</hi> opposed to Shadows. <hi>The Word
was made Flesh.</hi> The Eternal, and Substantial Image of God, which is the
<hi>Temple,</hi> the true <hi>Heaven</hi> brought forth itself into a Temporary, and Shadowy
Image, which is the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and the <hi>Paradise</hi> of the whole Creation. As
it is in the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> so is it in his Spouse, who is <hi>the Fulness of him that
silleth All in All.</hi> This <hi>vile Body</hi> in which a Saint is here; this dark, and course
Form, with which our Souls, and Bodies are cloathed here, is the <hi>Tent,</hi> that
covereth the Tabernacle; the <hi>Earthly House of the Tabernacle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Obser.</hi> The Effect of Death is different in these Three.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Tent,</hi> the <hi>Earthly House</hi> onely is <hi>dissolved.</hi> It is dissolved, and no more. It
is taken to pieces. The Word belongeth to the taking down of a house; or
the taking of Horses out of the Coach, and setting them up in a stable at an Inn,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:49838:164"/>
when the day, and the Journey are ended. The Dark, and Narrow Form,
which made it a <hi>Vile Body,</hi> a <hi>Body of Death,</hi> is lost. The Materials are laid up
in the Tabernacle.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Tabernacle</hi> is taken into the Temple. This is that, which shall <hi>be
cloathed upon from Heaven, v. 2. If so be, that being cloathed,</hi> (or, as it is in
Greek, if having been cloathed, namely with the Tabernacle) <hi>we shall not be
found naked</hi> (of the Tabernacle in Death,) <hi>v.</hi> 3. So it is explained in the words
following; <hi>For we, that are in the Tabernacle do groan being burthened: not that
we should be uncloathed</hi> (of the Tabernacle;) <hi>but cloathed upon, that Mortality
might be swallowed up of Life;</hi> (that the Form of Mortality might be lost
for ever in Immortality, and the Mortal Things continue being now become
Immortal.)</p>
               <p>When thou puttest on <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> thou puttest on that Image of Grace,
and Nature, in which Para<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ise is revived, and heightned, in which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
all that is good, fair, and pleasant thorow the whole Creation quickned
with a new Sun-shine from on high. This thou puttest on in thy Natural Man.
This thou shalt never put off, after that thou hast once been cloathed with it. It
is still cloathed upon with a higher and higher Glory from Heaven; until in
Death the Glorified Body of <hi>Christ</hi> come down entirely upon it in the fulness
of all its Divine Beauties.</p>
               <p>3. The Eternal Building in Heaven, thy Glorified Person, which was hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to hid in God, with, and in the Glorified Person of thy Saviour now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down, cloatheth thee entirely, resteth openly upon thee, never to go off
from thy Tabernacle more.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Observ.</hi> See the beautiful, and sweet manner of Dying. Death is expressed
in Two Representations; 1. <hi>A Dissolution; 2. A Deluge; a Swallowing up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. <hi>Death is a Dissolution. If our earthly house of this Tabernacle be dissolved;
v.</hi> 1. A Troop of everblessed Spirits united by Eternal Love into one Form
of Glory make the Heavenly Body of thy Beloved. In the same Form, and
yet another, they make thy Heavenly Body, and Person in the Bosom of thy
Bridegroom, O Believer! These descending are by the sacred knot of this dark,
and narrow Form in Nature tied together into One Mortal Person; in which
they are the Shadow of themselves; and tied down to the Earth to stand their
Tryal in the midst of all sorts of Temptations.</p>
               <p>Thus they continue, till they have finished the Mystery of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
the Figure of Divine Things in their Persons here below. Then, when
the set Time is come according to the Laws of that Eternal Harmony in the
Nature of God, which is the Supream Love, Beauty, and Wisdom, all in One;
they dye after this manner.</p>
               <p>That Troop of glorious Spirits, which is Thy-Self above come down upon
Themselves, Thy Self imprisoned in their Shadow below. As the Fire of God,
they touch with some Mysterious Stroak of Providence the knot of this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:49838:165"/>
Form; Immediately it untieth, and is dissolved. Now all these Spirits thus
set free retaining the Unchangeable Unity of thy Person return, Each to It<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Liberty, Beauty, Joy, and Glorious Majesty of its proper Substance,
and Its own, Its First Heavenly State. Yea, they are already there in their Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Eternal in the Heavens. This Eternal Building, these Heavens come down
upon them, to cloath them from above; that in no one moment they may be
found naked, At once they spring up out of the Earth, they come down out
of Heaven, and meet, and kiss each other, and fall into One with a Wonderful
Shout, a Triumphant Concurrence of all Blessed Spirits in the Perfect Freedom of
all their Joys, and Glories. They fall into One, because they are One, and this One is
Thy self. In an Instant, the Twinkling of an Eye, the Living Word cometh
to them, the knot of Nature is dissolved, all fly, this knot, the Figure itself, the
Shadow, like Doves to their Windows, like a Court to their several Mansions
in the same Palace; So they fly into the Bosom of their proper Substances; where
Thou art the same Person in Truth, at Liberty, and awake which thou wert
in Show, in Captivity, in a Dream here below. Thou art the Unity, in which
all these Spirits with the unsearchable Riches of their several Varieties ever
centred, and dwelt together, as One, once shut up in darkness, and in a narrow
place; but now displaying all their Beauties, unfolding all their Joys to the
full. O how are the Beauties, and Pleasures of thy Death, O Saint, far beyond
all those of Marriage, and of Children. How doest thou in that moment meet,
and marry thy self in all the flourishing Glories, with all the warm and fresh
Loves of the Divine Nature? How doest thou bring forth a Troop of Divine
Spirits in thine own Form, and Person to be ever before thee, bred up, and
Living with thee, rejoycing in thee, the Delight of thine Eyes, and the Jewels
of thy Bosom, the pleasure of thine Embraces day by day!</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>first Representation of Death</hi> by a <hi>Dissolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Death</hi> is a <hi>Deluge; that Mortality might be swallowed up of Life,</hi> 2. Cor.
5. <hi>v.</hi> 4. It is in <hi>Greek; that the,</hi> or, <hi>this Mortal may be swallowed up of Life.
Life</hi> in the Abstract, in its Purity, and Perfection without any Mixture, or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
is Immortality, Eternity, Christ, and God. As God is Light, in which there
is no Darkness: so God is Light, in which there is nothing of its contrary, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in act, nor in possibility; no Death, nor Shadow of Death. <hi>The Mortal</hi>
is that, which is capable of Dying in a Saint with the Principles of Corruption,
and Power of Death adhering to it.</p>
               <p>See the Glory, the Might of this Glory, the Extent of it in the Death of a
Saint. <hi>Life</hi> Itself in its own Divine Essence, as a Divine Substance, no more
an Accident, in the Purity of all Its Sweetnesses, in the Perfection of all Its
Powers, as it reigneth upon the Throne of Eternity, breaketh forth upon the
Person of a Saint, upon all His Powers, and Parts, the lowest, the darkest, the
most Mortal. As It breaketh forth, It drinketh up all together with the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of Death Itself encompassing them into itself.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:49838:165"/>
Mortal Things are Shadows of Immortal; that is, Figures in the Dark. But
the Darkness also is Part of the Figure. The Life of pure Nature is an Image-Life
a Shadowy Life. The Darkness swallowing up the Figure, and defacing
the Shadow is a Natural Death. The Devil lurking in the Dark Part, as in His
Den, from thence coming forth into the Figure is the Life of Sin. When a
Sinner dieth, the Devil in the Darkness of the Shadow, Divine Wrath thorow
the Devil swallow up the Darkness, Image, and all into themselves.</p>
               <p>But at the new Birth of a Saint, the Eternal Life, and Substance awakeneth
itself in the Shadow, liveth, and weareth that Darkness, as a Divine Vail upon
Its Beauties too bright to appear nakedly on Earth. It acteth that Figure, as a
Picture with the Life in it; looking forth through, and springing through
it, as a Flower thorow the Lattices and the Windows. Then when the time
of Harvest, and the Singing of Birds is come; this Eternal Life drinketh up
All into its own unmixt, unfading Light. Thus a Saint dieth.</p>
               <p>As sometimes the Sea sendeth forth an Island, which after sometimes it again
swalloweth up: so is the Life, and Death of a good Man in His Mortal Part.
He riseth up like an Island from the unfathomable, and glorious Depths of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Sea, the Sea of Eternal Life and Love. He standeth rooted in this Sea,
and encompassed with It on every side. So He lives. Again He sinketh down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Blessed Depths, out of which He arose. So He dieth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elijah</hi> laid His Sacrifice with a pile of wood upon the Altar. He digged Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
round about the Altar, which he filled with Water, till it ran over. Then
he called upon the Name of the God of <hi>Israel.</hi> Immediately a Fire descended
from Heaven, which licked up all the Water, consumed the Sacrifice with the
Wood upon the Altar.</p>
               <p>The Altar is our <hi>Jesus</hi> filling the Earth, as well as the Heavens. The Saint
in his Divine Part is the Sacrifice upon the Altar, in Union with <hi>Christ.</hi> The
Wood is the Mortal Part of a Saint, which also lyeth upon the Altar of Christ's
glorified Person, The low estate of a Saint in Flesh with all his Sufferings, and
Sorrows, all the Powers of Darkness, and Death, make the Trenches full of
Waters round about Him: At length the Divine Sea from below, when It hath
fulfilled the Days of Its Pilgrimage, and Imprisonment, calleth to Its Father above.
Then in a moment the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in His Glorified Body, as a Flame of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Love and Life cometh down from Heaven upon this Saint, drinketh
up at once the Sacrifice; the Wood, the Waters, and All into One Flame with
itself. Nothing remaineth, but the Altar, and the Trenches; the Place, where
they had been; the Double Image in which they had appeared; a Light-Image
Beautiful, and Pleasant in the Spirits of Light; a Dark-Image in Dark Spirits.
Both these by degrees vanish into their several Elements of Light, and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>I have done with my <hi>first Principle</hi> in the <hi>second Part</hi> of my present <hi>use</hi>
which is to <hi>sweeten,</hi> and <hi>sanctify Death</hi> by the <hi>Spiritual Knowledge</hi> of our Lord,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49838:166"/>
                  <hi>Jesus.</hi> The <hi>first Principle</hi> was this: <hi>A Saint is compleat above in the Glorified
Body of Jesus Christ; while he is living, or dying here below.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Principle: The Glorified Person of our Saviour with all its Divine Fulness
dwelleth Spiritually in the Natural Body of each Saint on Earth.</hi> Our fleshly
Members are the <hi>Members of Christ</hi> in Heaven, 1 <hi>Corin. 6. 15. The riches of
the Glory of this Mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the Hope of
Glory, Col.</hi> 1. 27. As the Essential Form of a Plant with all its proportions,
and perfections lieth inclosed in the Seed, which by the breaking of the Seed,
displayeth itself upon it, and transfigureth the Seed; so is the Natural Body of
each Believer a Seed; so is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> the <hi>Hope of Glory,</hi> a Body of Glory
to that Seed, and dwelleth inclosed in it, until the Spring of Death.</p>
               <p>The Natural Body is called a <hi>Body of Death,</hi> Rom. 7. 24. <hi>We are said to
wait for the Adoption, or Sonship, the Redemption of the Body, Rom.</hi> 8. 23. These
two Bodies cannot be the same. One is a <hi>Redeemed</hi> Body; a Body of <hi>Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or <hi>Sonship.</hi> This is, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh before, a Body brought forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Liberty of the Glory of a Son of God.</hi> The other is a Body of <hi>Death.
St. Paul</hi> cryeth out against one: <hi>Who shall deliver me from this Body of Death?
St. Paul groaneth,</hi> and <hi>waiteth</hi> for the <hi>Redemption</hi> of the other, as a Son of
God. One is the Oppressour; the other is oppressed. One is a Grave, and
Death; the other is a Divine Life, a Form of Glory, a Son of God in the
Valley of the shadow of Death in the Grave.</p>
               <p>As a Sun at night casting up its Cloud, and foretelling a fair day: so is the
Death of a Saint; the Glorified Body of a Saint being one Spirit with the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
Body of his Beloved, casteth up the Cloud of this Natural Body, which

nothing to thee, but as it is an Appearance rising up in thy Body, which by

vertue of the Personal Union raiseth a suitable Act of Life in thy Soul. All
this World to thee is only a diversity of Forms, into which it is varied, and a

            <p>I have finished my discourse on the <hi>first part.</hi> I now take in hand the <hi>second
part.</hi> I have spoken something of the <hi>Loveliness</hi> of our Beloved One, as I have
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:49838:167"/>
by any Beam from his Beauties been enlightned to some glimmering vision of
them, and quickned to a weak expression of that, which I have seen.</p>
            <p>Now I am to speak of his Love, as the Grace, and Sweetness of it shall
pour forth itself from his Lips into mine by a Spiritual kiss from the Mouth of
this Heavenly Bridegroom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grace is poured forth in his Lips.</hi> The rich composition of this Heavenly-sweet
Sentence is made up of three rich Materials; 1. <hi>Grace; 2. Effusion,</hi> or the
pouring forth of this Grace; 3. The <hi>Lips</hi> of the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> These are to
be explained.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Grace.</hi> This in the Language of the Scripture signifieth three Things.
1. <hi>Grace</hi> is <hi>Love. For the Grace of God, which bringeth salvation to all Men,
hath appeared;</hi> Tit. 2. 11. <hi>But after that the kindness, and love of God our
Saviour toward Men hath appeared. Tit.</hi> 3. 4. That which in one place the
Apostle calleth <hi>Grace,</hi> in the other he expresseth by <hi>kindness,</hi> and <hi>love. Grace</hi>
is <hi>love</hi> in its Fountain <hi>freest,</hi> and <hi>sweetest. 2. Grace</hi> is <hi>Loveliness,</hi> or Beauty.
<hi>Prov. 31. 30. Favour is deceitful, and Beauty is vain. Favour</hi> there is <hi>Grace.</hi>
It is the same word in <hi>Hebrew</hi> with this in my Text. Grace is Beauty with its
most powerful charms, as it toucheth every Spirit, answereth every desire, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
all things answer it, and dance to its Musick. So the Hebrew word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.
3. <hi>Grace</hi> is <hi>Joy,</hi> or pleasure a fair, and smiling Child begotten between
these two amiable, and ever-pleasant Parents <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Beauty. St. Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
the Saints to sing, <hi>making melody to God with Grace in their hearts;</hi>
that is, with Divine Joy kindled into a Heavenly Flame from the Love, and
Loveliness of the Lord <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sus</hi> shining forth there unitedly, and concentring
their joint Beams in the Beloved Spirit.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Grace</hi> is all three, Love, Loveliness, and Joy; all these with a peculiar,
and most eminent heightning; as the Sunshine is the Grace of a Garden, and
the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owers in it: So Grace in the sense of the Gospel is Love, Beauty, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
with the God-Head the Sun of Spirits peculiarly, and nakedly shining in
them.</p>
            <p>But principally, and primitively <hi>Grace</hi> is <hi>Love.</hi> Then it is Loveliness, as
that is the first Birth, and lively Image of Love, in which it bringeth forth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to its own Eye, and embraces, then sporteth with it as its Spouse. It is
Pleasure, as that springeth from the Union of these two, and is their mutual
Life, and Perfection each in other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grace</hi> is a Tree, where <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>Root,</hi> and <hi>Sap; Loveliness</hi> the fair Tree
with its Body, and Branches rising out of this Root, whose Sap formeth itself into
this Beautiful Figure. <hi>Joy</hi> is the Fruit, into which the sweet Sap of Love from
its Root, thorow the Body, and Branches of its shining Beauties digesteth itself
unto a perfect, admirable, and Divine Maturity to be the Food, and Feast of
all Lives, all Spirits in Time, and Eternity. It is Love smiling in the face of
every Beauty, which is the Grace of it, as the Water, and Sparklings of Light
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49838:167"/>
in a Diamond are the Grace of that. It is the Tast, and Rellish of Love in
every Joy, is as the Wine, which is the Grace of the Feast.</p>
            <p>It is the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> at its height, which is the Grace intended here.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Effusion,</hi> or <hi>Pouring forth</hi> of this <hi>Grace</hi> is next to be opened. Three,
things are signified in this Effusion, 1. A <hi>Fulness</hi> of Grace is discovered. Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
work to the utmost of their Power. God is in nothing so Natural, as in His
Love. His work of wrath is his strange work, praeternatural to Him, and a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise
upon Him. Love is His Right Hand; the Sheep are set at his Right Hand. Love
flows forth from the Person of the Father unveiled, &amp; naked, as Light from the Sun;
Millions of fresh Beams each moment from each point. 2. Freedom of Grace is
manifested in Its Pouring forth itself. It is its own First Mover. It puts itself into
Motion. It is a fluid thing. It cannot contain itself within its own Bound, the
Heart of God. It is ever pouring forth itself all abroad into every Heart. Divine
Love is the most universal and importunate Beggar. It cometh to the door
of every Spirit. It Knocketh. It presseth in. 3. A <hi>Force</hi> of Love putteth forth
itself in this Expression. When the Rain cometh with a Tempest, and falleth
with a great force, we say; It poureth down. Love from above stormeth Hearts
most fortified against it. It rusheth forth like a mighty flood. If any banks, or
dams oppose it, it riseth so much the higher, it gathereth so much the more
strength, till it bear down all before it, carry away all with it, overflow
all, swallow up all into itself, that all things become One Sea of Love.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Lips</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> into which this Grace is poured forth, may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
four ways. 1. The Word of the Scriptures, and the Outward Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
are the <hi>Lips</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> in which Grace is poured forth. All the Scriptures
are Love-letters from <hi>Christ</hi> in Heaven; all the Ministeries of the Gospel are
Love-Embassages, Love-tokens. 2. All Outward Providences, all Inward Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> are His <hi>Lips,</hi> with which He kisseth us, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth the Divine Sweetness, and Strength of His Love into our Spirits; 3.
The <hi>Spirit</hi> Himself is the Mouth, and Lips of the Heavenly Bridegroom. By
this He uniteth Himself most immediately to us in the closest, and Divinest
Love-union. By this He transmitteth Himself, and His Love most warmly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us. 4. The naked Person of <hi>Christ</hi> in Glory is to be understood by these
<hi>Lips.</hi> The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> composeth this Psalm, as a Marriage-song to celebrate the
Union, State, and Joys of the Heavenly Bridegroom, and Bride in the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and Ascension of our Blessed Lord. Here the Person of our Beloved
is all a Divine Mouth, with which He breatheth forth all the Sweetnesses of
His glorious Nature, and Love, as He sucketh in ours. It is all One Divine Eye
from which He poureth forth upon us continual Floods of Light, Beauty, and
Grace; by which also He taketh us in continually in all Blessed Forms of an
Immortal Loveliness, and Love; Thus we see our selves continually in Him;
He seeth Himself continually in us; Eye to Eye, each a Living Glass of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Love to the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:49838:168"/>
The <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in Glory are <hi>Both One.</hi> A Bee in a Garden
sitteth upon every flower, and plant, sucking the vertue forth from it. This it
formeth into One Sweetness in itself, which is Honey. Full of this Honey it
flyeth to its Hive, and there layeth up its pleasant Treasures. So this Spirit rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon every Excellency in the God-Head, every Life, and Image of things
in the Creature. It extracteth the several virtues from all. It turneth all within
itself into One Divine, and unexpressible Sweetness, which is Love. With this
Treasure of Love it maketh haste to some broken, and forlorn Heart: There
in this Heart, in thine Heart, if thou wilt believe, that thou mayest tast, and
see it, it layeth down its precious Burthen, it layeth up the inestimable Riches of
glorious Grace.</p>
            <p>We read in the building of the Temple that there was a great Sea of Brass,
which stood upon twelve Oxen the figures of the Cherubims. Our Saviour's
glorified Person is a vast Sea of Love. All the Angels of God support this Sea,
serve this Love. The God-Head itself in a bright, and sweet flood of Love is
poured abroad in this Sea, in this Bosom, and Person. Here every Believing
Soul batheth itself in, and taketh its Fill of Loves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> The Doctrine which I intend to insist upon according to the Grace of
God given unto me is this. <hi>The Love of God is poured forth in the Glorified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our Lord Jesus. Thy Name is an Ointment poured forth, Cant.</hi> 1. 2. The
<hi>Name</hi> of our Beloved, which His Spouse Knoweth Him by, and calleth Him
by, is That <hi>Name above every Name</hi> in this World, or the World of Angels,
which the Father hath given Him at His Resurrection, and Ascension; <hi>Ephes.</hi>
1. 21. This <hi>Name</hi> is His Person itself in Glory, which is the onely Expression
of itself. This is an <hi>Ointment poured forth.</hi> O Blessed Ointment of Divine Love,
which hath all the Cordial Spices, and Sweets of the God-Head itself in it, which
perfumeth all things thorow Heaven, and Earth; which maketh all Faces to
shine with a Divine Lustre, and all Hearts to spring with a Divine Joy! This
costly Ointment was before shut up, and kept in an Alabaster Box, in the
Glorious Secret of the Father's Bosom. But now that Box is broken in the
Death of our King. That Bosom is opened in His Resurrection. That sweet
Treasure of all Life, and Delight, the Eternal Love of the Father is poured
forth at the Root of the Creation, upon the Head of every Creature in the
Glorified Person of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Its sweet Savour is gone forth into the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils
of every Spirit, to revive it, and allure it to its Everlasting Embraces.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>John 5. 11. This is the Record;</hi> (namely of God Himself,) <hi>that God hath
given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in His Son. Eternity</hi> is defined to be The
Possession of all Good at once, and in One. There are Three things, which go
to make up Eternity 1. A <hi>Perfection of Excellency.</hi> 2. A <hi>Collection of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies</hi>
3. A <hi>Station</hi> of all these with their several Distinctions in One Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
of Spirituality above all Division, or Change. Love is the Union of
Lovely Things. The most Perfect Love is the most Perfect Union, which
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:49838:168"/>
bindeth up all Lovelinesses in their several Perfections into the streightest
Unity. Eternal Life then is the Life of Love in its Purity, and Perfection.
Eternity is Love itself; the firmest, and Fullest Union of all Graces, and Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Things in the height of Glory, and the height of Unity.</p>
            <p>This Eternal Life, this Eternal Love; this Life of Love, which is the Life
of Eternity is diffused, is given to us by the Father in the Glorified Person of
<hi>Christ.</hi> This is the Glorifying of His Person, the Pouring forth of this Love,
which is the Gold of the Temple, the Glory of Eternity, in Him, as in a
Common Person, in which the whole Creation lyeth.</p>
            <p>Before I leave this Scripture, which I have brought for the Proof of my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
ye who hear, and ye who read, stand still a while, and together with
me gaze upon, admire the riches of the glory of the <hi>Grace,</hi> and Love of God in
the Gospel. <hi>This,</hi> saith <hi>St. John, is the Record, that He hath given us Eternal
Life, and this Life is in His Son.</hi> You have here the whole Substance of the
Gospel, the Record of God, the Glad Tydings from Heaven summ'd up. It
is <hi>Love.</hi> This Love lyeth in Three Parts; 1. <hi>Free Grace</hi> in these words,
<hi>God hath given us.</hi> 2. The <hi>Gift</hi> of Free Grace, <hi>Eternal Life.</hi> You have heard
already, that the Eternity, the Perfection, and Crown of Life is Love. 3.
The Lovely <hi>Seat</hi> of this Gift; <hi>and this Life,</hi> this Love, <hi>is in His Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold, how the <hi>Love</hi> of the Gospel is no other, than the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and
the 3 <hi>Parts</hi> of this <hi>Love</hi> the 3 <hi>Persons</hi> in that <hi>Divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1, <hi>Free Grace</hi> is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of Love, the Fountain of the God-Head, the
<hi>Father</hi> the <hi>Giver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Gift</hi> is the Holy Spirit, Love itself, the Eternity of Life, and Love,
the Collection of all Loves and Lives in Eternity, the Gathering together of all
the pure, and sweet Waters of Love, and Life into One Place.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Seat</hi> of this Gift; the <hi>Son.</hi> The Person of our Bridegroom is that
vast, bright, and Beautiful Deep prepared, as a place for those pleasant Waters,
those Treasures of Love.</p>
            <p>How are the Windows of the God-Head here set wide open to pour down
Showers of Love! How are the great Deeps of the God-Head broken up to
send forth Floods of Love! What a Blessed Deluge of Love is here, enough
to drown ten thousand Worlds of Sins, and Souls after a Lovely manner; so
that the Sins shall never live, nor appear more; the Souls shall never dye, nor be
at all darkened any more!</p>
            <p>Come now ye unbelieving Hearts; be subdued to the Faith of the Gospel
by the Strength of this Love. Come ye hard Hearts; bee softned by the
Sweetness of this Love. Come ye unclean Hearts; be refined, be Spiritualised,
be raised above Sense, Flesh, by the Purity of this Love. All the Strength, all
the Sweetness, all the Purity, and Pure Beauties of the Divine Nature are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
in this Love. The Three Glorious Persons in the Trinity are no other,
than Love itself in so many Forms of Beauty, and Blessedness acting those Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49838:169"/>
Parts, which may make all the Joys, and Glories of Love compleat in
them, and in you.</p>
            <p>I shall prosecute my <hi>Doctrine</hi> under <hi>three Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Nature</hi> of Divine Love. 2. The <hi>Effusion,</hi> or pouring forth of
this Love. 3. The Person of our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> as this Love is poured forth
into him.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Head.</hi> The <hi>Nature</hi> of Divine Love. I shall endeavour to explain this
to you by <hi>three Descriptions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Descript.</hi> Divine Love is a <hi>Union</hi> between God, as a Lover, and the
Soul, as his Love, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 16, 17. It is said, they two shall be one Flesh. But
he that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> Marriage is the Solemnity, Festival,
and Crown of Love. The Marriage-Union is the perfection of the Love-Union.
The Spirit speaketh here of a Marriage in the Flesh, as a Figure, and
Foil only; but of the Marriage in the Spirit as Love-Union in its Lustre, and
its Life.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Love-Union</hi> hath <hi>three Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. There is a <hi>Unity,</hi> which is the ground of Love. All Love springeth
from this Divine Seed sown throughout all things; a Primitive, and Original
Unity.</p>
            <p>2. There is a <hi>Distinction</hi> in the Unity, which is the Life of Love. This
maketh the Lovers. The Unity springeth up within itself into a Distinct, and
Beautiful Image of itself, that it may be both its Lover, and its Love.</p>
            <p>3. There is a <hi>Union</hi> of these two, the Original, and its own Life-Image, as
they stand distinct in the Unity. This is Love consummate. This is the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-bed
of Divine Love, ever flourishing and fruitful. Here it multiplieth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into innumerable Loves, Beauties, and Joys, which flow endlesly fresh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
moment out of this sacred Fountain.</p>
            <p>Thus Love is the Circle of Eternity, hath its beginning in itself, springeth
up out of itself, returneth again into itself without beginning or end.</p>
            <p>Thus in Heavenly Love first one is made two, then two are made one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
So is it all four in one, a Birth, a Marriage, a Death, a Resurrection in
a continual Circle; while they are ever bringing forth one another; dying
into each other; rising again one out of the other; and in all united. This is
the Divine sport, or play of Spiritual Love.</p>
            <p>You shall see these <hi>three parts</hi> of the Heavenly Love-union in three <hi>Images;</hi>
in <hi>Heaven;</hi> in <hi>Paradise;</hi> in the <hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Love-Union</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi> The <hi>first Person</hi> in the Trinity is the God-Head
in the <hi>Unity,</hi> which is the Center, and Spring of all Love. The <hi>Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
is the God-Head distinguishing itself into a variety of Persons in the Unity.
The God-Head in the glorious, and deep center of its Unity springeth up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an express Image of itself, shining forth from the Unity, and shining back
upon it in the brightness of all its own Glories within its own Divine deep,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:49838:169"/>
and Center. This is to the Father perfectly <hi>Himself, his Son,</hi> and <hi>his Spouse,</hi>
all in one. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>Third Person.</hi> This is the <hi>Union</hi> of the other
two. Divines therefore peculiarly appropriate the name of <hi>Love</hi> to this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
The manner of his Production is expressed by a <hi>Procession</hi> from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Son joyntly, by way of breathing, as the sweets of two Flowers
mingling in the same Air, or as the Divine Kiss of two Spirits, by which they
breath forth themselves each into other, and become two Spirits in one.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>first Image</hi> of the <hi>Love-Union</hi> in Heaven; where the Mystery
of the Trinity is the high, and Holy Mystery of Love in its Original. Here
first of all one is made two, and those two are made one again.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Love-Union</hi> in <hi>Paradise. Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> together with the race of <hi>all Living,</hi>
to which <hi>Eve</hi> was Mother, stood at first in <hi>Adam,</hi> all in one. <hi>Male, and Female
made He him, Gen. 1. v.</hi> This was Humane Nature in its Unity, the figure of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Unity, the Father in the Trinity. <hi>Then Eve</hi> was taken out of <hi>Adam.</hi> The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was distinguished into two Persons, and Sexes within itself. For <hi>Adam</hi> saith of
<hi>Eve</hi> after the distinction; <hi>This is Flesh of my Flesh, and Bone of my Bone.</hi> The
Unity of the Nature continued in the two Sexes. Now the Woman was the <hi>Image,</hi>
and the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Man in Paradise, as the Son is the <hi>Image</hi> of the Father,
and the Brightness of his Glory in Heaven. Now there is no Solitude in the
Unity, which maketh Paradise a Wilderness, the Unity is the true Paradise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
itself springing up into variety, then marrying itself to it, and so flourishing
from this Union with all manner of Beautiful, and pleasant Fruits. By this
Birth and Distinction in the Unity, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> are capable of enjoying
themselves each in other, and of multiplying themselves. <hi>Thirdly, Eve</hi> is
brought to <hi>Adam</hi> again, and these <hi>two</hi> are made <hi>one Flesh.</hi> This is the making
of <hi>two one</hi> again, which were first made <hi>two</hi> of <hi>one.</hi> This Unity in the Dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inction,
and Distinction in the Unity is that Marriage in Paradise, which is the
Type of that Incomprehensible Marriage above all Heavens, which is the
Third Person in the Trinity. In him the Father, and the Son spend Eternity
in mutual Embraces, and multiply themselves into an Infiniteness of Blessed
Lives, Blessed Loves.</p>
            <p>You that are Married Persons, see your selves in this double Glass of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
and the Trinity. By these Glasses dress your selves in your Loveliness,
and Loves one for another. <hi>St. Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>Marriage is Honourable among
all,</hi> or <hi>in all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Type hath a double Honour; the Figure, which is Shadowy, the Truth,
which is a substantial Glory. Husbands, and Wives preserve the Honour of
your state at least in the shadowy part. Bear the Figure of the Ever-glorious
Trinity, whose Type you are, by a mortal Beauty, Truth, Purity, Sweetness,
which are the Gold, and precious Mettal in the Ring of this Love-union.
This will make Marriage an Earthly Paradise. But rest not in this. You will
find a Serpent here, that will quickly poyson all your Sweets, and change your
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49838:170"/>
Flowers into Thorns; if you pass not thorow the Earthly into the Heavenly
Paradise. Then you wear the Marriage-Crown in Truth, when that Spirit,
which is the Band of Love between the Father, and the Son, is the Eternal
Band of Divine Love between you also; when you also make your Marriage-Bed
in the Bosom of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Joys, what an Immortal Off-spring is born of those Lovers, where
the Love-fellowship of these below, and the sacred Love-fellowship of the
Blessed Trinity above descend, and ascend one into another, where they mingle
themselves Universally?</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Love-Union</hi> in the <hi>Soul, Joh. 3. 6. That which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Divine Being, Life, and Form of the Soul, in which it is a Spirit, lie
first wrapt up in the Unity of the Eternal Spirit its Heavenly Mother above.</p>
            <p>The Eternal Spirit out of this Love-Center, and within the Love-Circle of
its own Unity by the New-birth in the Soul bringeth forth at once a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Spirit,
a Sister, and Spouse to itself.</p>
            <p>This Divine Spirit, like the Paradisical <hi>Eve,</hi> so soon as it is born of its Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Adam,</hi> is brought to him again, and <hi>they Two are made one Spirit,
1 Cor.</hi> 6. 17. As a New-born Babe, so soon as it is sprung out of the Womb,
seeketh the Breast of the Mother, that it may suck forth a continued stream
of Life from the Fountain of its Life: so is it in the Spiritual Birth. So soon,
as the New-born Spirit ariseth up out of this Unity, which is the Womb of
the God-Head; it is immediately received into the Arms of this Unity; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
after, it hunteth for, it returneth to, it fastneth upon this Unity, which is
the Breast of the God-Head. By this it draweth in the sincere, and pure Milk
of the living Word; it taketh in by plentiful streams the Light, Life, Glory,
Substance of the Divine Nature to grow by them. O you, who indeed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
born of this Unity, lie continually in the Bosom of it, hang continually upon
this Breast. But thus, as in the Eternal Generation in Heaven; as
in the Creation in Paradise; as in the Regeneration, which is
the opening of Paradise, and Heaven both a second time in the Soul;
all are <hi>Love-Births, Love-Unions.</hi> The Unity distinguisheth itself within itself
into another self, which is yet still the same, that there may be a variety in
the Unity without the breach of the Unity. The Virgin above bringeth forth
a Son, which is also her Lord, and continueth a Virgin still. The Beautiful
variety, which is the Effulge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cy of the Unity, rejoyneth itself again to it, and
still remaineth a variety in its distinction from it. Thus the Love-Marriage is
every where solemnized, and every where maketh a Paradise, and a Heaven
above, and below. This is the <hi>first Description</hi> of Divine Love, a Divine U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
where one Glorious Spirit is made two, and these two make themselves
one again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> Learn from the Beauty, and Sweetness of Divine Love, the Evil of
this Worlds Love by their contrariety to it. <hi>Ye Adulterers, and Adulteresses,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:49838:170"/>
Know ye not, that the Friendship of this World is Enmity to the Father. Who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is this World's Friend. is an Enemy to God: James.</hi> 4. 4. See the Evil of
this World's Love in 3. <hi>Steps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Step</hi> By loving this World you separate yourselves from the Love of
God. You estrange your selves from all true Joy, Peace, and Rest. For these
are the Attendants, and Companions of Divine Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 7, 8. You read of <hi>Solomon's Bed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which hath fourscore valiant menos
the valiant men of Israel round about it, with their swords girt upon their thigh
for the fear of the night.</hi> How great, how Divine is the Sweetness, the Safety,
the Security of Spiritual Love. He, that abideth in this Love enjoyeth an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted
Rest, and untroubled pleasures, in a Night of the greatest Darkness,
Dangers, Tumults, and Storms. He hath ever round about Him a Troop of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angels for his Guard, armed with the Glorious Power of the Spirit. This is
the Sword upon their Thigh. In the midst of these he lyeth upon a Royal
Marriage-bed. Here he is encircled with the Spiritual Embraces of King
<hi>Solomon,</hi> the Lord Jesus in Glory, the King of all Peace, Perfections, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
This is the Love of God, that Love, by which God, and the Soul live,
and dwell together in One Spirit.</p>
            <p>You now, who prefer the blackness of darkness before the Beauty of <hi>Christs</hi>
Face, restless cares, endless fears, continual dangers, and deaths before the Rest,
and Joys of <hi>Christ's</hi> bosom, love this world, and let the love of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
go.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Step.</hi> By the Love of this World you make your selves Adulterers with
a Witch, and a Common Whore. Poor Soul! thou forsakest the Arms of
thine own Love, thy Loving Roe, and pleasant Hind, the Wife of thy Youth,
of Eternal Youth, the Heavenly Image in the Person of the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> Thou
givest thy self up to the Embraces of the strange Woman, the Strumpet, this
World the Fleshly Image of Things.</p>
            <p>The Love of your Saviour is all Truth, Purity, Peace, Immortality. The
Love of this World beginneth in Deceit, hath its Power in Enchantments, its
Effect Pollutions, its End Destruction. She giveth thee Drink indeed in a Golden
Cup. But she maketh thee to drink in first a Wine of Sorceries, then of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications.
Her End is to have her Flesh burnt with Fire; and into the same bed
of flames will God cast all those, that commit fornication with her.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Step.</hi> By loving this world thou makest thy self an Adulteress with the
Devil. This World, as it stealeth thine Heart from God is a Composure of
Lyes. The Devil, who is the Father of Lyes, maketh thy Soul his Strumpet,
upon which he begetteth these false Forms of things. Thou breedest these
young Devils upon thy Knee, and as thou sportest thy self with them, thou
suckest in by their Kisses the poyson, and fire of Hell into all thy veins.</p>
            <p>The Devil first wooes thee in a Counterfeit shape of false Beauty, Glory,
Power, Joys. When he hath gained thee, he breaketh forth upon thee in his
own shape of endless Terror, and Horrours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:49838:171"/>
There is nothing truer, than that the Love of this World is a Spiritual Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
with the Devil, and the Head of all Adulteries, of all Defilements. There
is nothing more sure, than that Carnal Adultery in all the degrees of it, the
Similitude of this, most powerfully calleth up into us, and upon us the Spirit
of this World, the Prince of Darkness, the Devil with all His Dark, Deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Destroying Powers. O ye sons, and Daughters of men, who dwell in
the midst of the snares, and nets of this great, painted Adulteress, be aware of
your danger. Abide in your first Principle your Root, your first Husband, the
Eternal Love of the Father in <hi>Christ.</hi> Abide in your own Habitation, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of your own Bride, the Eternal Beauty, the Essential, and Immortal Image
of the God-Head in <hi>Christ.</hi> These Loves shall be a Fountain of Life to you
above to preserve you from the snares of Death below.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Step.</hi> By the Love of this World you turn the Love of God into Wrath,
and fury <hi>If you be the Friends of this World, you are the Enemies of God;</hi> saith
St. <hi>James.</hi> Why do you provoke the Love of God? Will you contend with
Almighty Love? Are you greater, than that? Love is the Right Hand of God's
Strength; His God-Head lieth in His Love. <hi>God is Love.</hi> This Love is strong,
as Death; cruel, as the Grave. What art thou, O Worm, to stand before it,
to bear its rage? O choose rather to lye down, as a Bride, in these everlasting
Burnings, and Devouring Fires of Love to be cherished, changed refined, and
glorified by their tender, and divine Embraces; than to set thy self, as Bryars,
and Thorns against them, to be consumed by them.</p>
            <p>Thus I have done with the First Description of Divine Love; A Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God, and the Soul, as the Beloved, and His Love in One Spirit of Purity,
Immortality, Joy, and Glory.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Descrip.</hi> The Love of God is the Will of God.</p>
            <p>This is a Universal Truth that in every Spirit <hi>Love,</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> are <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This appeareth in their <hi>Nature,</hi> their <hi>Object,</hi> their <hi>Operation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1, The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> are One. The Will is defined to be
the <hi>Inclination</hi> of the Spirit as it tendeth, and bendeth itself to this or that, this
way, or that way. <hi>Love</hi> is stiled The <hi>Weight</hi> of the Soul. As heavy things by
their Weight; so Souls by their <hi>Love</hi> are carried to their proper Center.</p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Object</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> and of <hi>Love</hi> is the same. It is a rule, that The
Powers, and Habits in Spirits are distingu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shed by their Objects. Every Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and Faculty is the Object in its S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed. The Object is the Form, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Principle. The Object of the Will is <hi>Goodness Appearing.</hi> The
Object of Love is <hi>Loveliness,</hi> Loveliness, and Goodness both consist in Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which hath its Ground in Unity. If there be any Difference between Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Loveliness, it is this, that as the Flower of Light is the Sun-shine;
and as <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is the Ef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ulgency, the Shine of the God-Head, the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Glory of God; so Loveliness, or Beauty is Goodness shining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut to
attract all Hearts to it. Thus <hi>Loveliness</hi> the Object of Love, and <hi>Goodness Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing</hi>
the Object of the Will agree entirely in One.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:49838:171"/>
3. All their <hi>Operations</hi> are the same. The Affections, and Passions are the
Motions of the Will; All these are Love's Summer, or Winter; Love in the
Seed is Desire. Love budding, and blossoming is Hope, Love in the ripe Fruit
is Joy. Anger, Fear, Grief, and Hatred are Love in its Opposition to its Enemy,
which is Enmity alone; Love flying from, or contending with that, which
standeth in its way to, or would rob it of its Beloved Object.</p>
            <p>But this is spoken in General onely concerning the <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Particular let us see, how the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Love</hi> appear
to be the same in the Holy Scriptures. The Will of God is distinguished
by Divines into the <hi>Revealed,</hi> and the <hi>Secret</hi> Will of God. One is the Divine
Will in <hi>Outward Signs</hi> onely, The Other is the Good-Pleasure of God in His
Heart, and in Eternity.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Revealed Will</hi> of God is <hi>Love, 1. Tim. 2. v.</hi> 1. &amp;c. In the <hi>first v.</hi>
of this <hi>Chapter</hi> you have a Divine <hi>Rule;</hi> that <hi>All</hi> manner of Prayers, be made
for <hi>All Men.</hi> This Rule is pressed by a particular Application of it to <hi>Kings,</hi>
and <hi>all in Authority; v. 2. All</hi> in Authority; what ever their Persons are, or
their Right, <hi>v.</hi> 3. The <hi>Reason</hi> of this Rule is laid down. <hi>For this is Good, and
Acceptable to God our Saviour.</hi> This <hi>Universal Love</hi> wound up to the Highest
strain of Spirituality, and Divinity in us is a Vein of the Supreme, and Divine
Good let forth from the Heart of God, where the Fountain of Good is, and
circling thorow our Hearts into his Heart again by Prayer. Therefore is it <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God.</hi> Our Wills are never so in tune to the Divine Will, and in
consort with it, as when the Spiritual motions of our Hearts in the Bosom of
the Father are strains of Universal Love.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Root</hi> of this Reason is discovered. <hi>v. 4. God will have all Men to
be saved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth. Love</hi> is said to consist in this;
<hi>To Will good to any one.</hi> If this be love to Will good to any; Then is it the
best, and highest love to Will the best, and highest good. Behold then! The
<hi>revealed Will</hi> of God is a <hi>Revelation of love</hi> to the height. <hi>God will have all Men
to be saved.</hi> God willeth the highest end, which is the best good to the lowest,
and worst of Men, to <hi>all</hi> Men. That this end may not fail, he also willeth the
means to the end; that <hi>all Men should come to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Ground,</hi> in which this <hi>root</hi> of love liveth, is the <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and
<hi>Christ. For there is one God and one Mediatour between God, and Man, the Man
Christ Jesus.</hi> The highest Unity Is the largest Universality. It is in Spirits, as
in these Heavens, which we see, the highest are the widest. All beneath them
lie in their Bosoms. The whole nature of things is love. For the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the Original is love. This love throughout the whole nature of things is
as a Pyramid made up by degrees of different Unions, till it end in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and most indivisible point of Unity.</p>
            <p>The Unity of God is that Fountain of love, out of which all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.
The secret force of this Unity is that stream of love, which runneth
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:49838:172"/>
thorow the Heart, and Veins of Every Creature in the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> which
is the golden Pipe with its several branches laid thorow the whole Creation
from the Beginning to the End. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between
God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>revealed Will</hi> of God is <hi>love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>secret Will</hi> of God is <hi>love. Fury is not in me. Who would set the
bryars, and thorns in Battel aray against me? I would go thorow them, I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
them.</hi> Wrath is not <hi>in</hi> God. It is without him only, as a Cloud upon the Sun.
The heart of God is Love. Wrath is but the work of his Hand, and that his
<hi>strange Work,</hi> like nothing within, a disguise only. The <hi>Face</hi> of God, and the
proper light of it is love. Wrath is vizor, a mist before his Face, and no more.</p>
            <p>Fury in God is love by the opposition heightned to a flame to consume all
vanity, and enmity, that setteth itself before it, or against it.</p>
            <p>O that I had a voice powerful enough to reach all the Souls wandring tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the whole Creation, and to call them together, to take this Cup of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into the hand of their Faith, to set it to the mouth of their Faith, and
drink deeply of it! As the Wine of this Cup goeth down into your Spirits,
you will find it to go down right. How sweetly, and how fully will it touch,
satisfy, and fill every faculty, every desire, every Seed of life with its proper
good. The Cup of Salvation, which I hold forth to you is this Divine Truth,
the Sum of the Gospel Preached by Angels in their Songs at the Birth of our
Jesus; <hi>The Will of God is love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hear this, and believe it, O ye Souls, the Inclination of God, the supream
Spirit, and Fountain of Spirits is to you. The tendency, and the bent of the
Divine Nature is to make your joys full by the possession of all good in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and to fulfil his own joys in you. For the Will is the Inclination of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Spirit; and the Will of God is love. Hear this, and believe it, O ye Souls,
God is carried with the whole weight of his God-Head to you, as to his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to rest eternally in you, and to rejoyce over you. For love is the weight
of every Spirit, and the Will of God is love. The Will of God in the
Freedom, Absoluteness, Infiniteness of it is love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now I live,</hi> saith <hi>St. Paul, if ye stand fast in the Faith,</hi> 1 Thes. 3. 8. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> speaketh not this in his own Spirit, but in the Spirit of God. God in his
own Spirit speaketh it with a greater force, and fuller sense to every one of
you, if you believe me, and take in my love, which is my life, now have I a
new Love, a new Life, a new Joy, and Heaven in you. As you grow in this
Faith, my Life, and Joy increaseth in you. If you stand fast in it, my Joy, and
Glory is as firm in your hearts, as in Heaven itself.</p>
            <p>If you will believe all the Declarations of God from Heaven; the revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Will of God is Love. If you have any Inward, and Divine Touch of
the secret Will of God; all the breathings of his Heart are Love. O take in
the Love of God, that his Love may become a Divine, Immortal Seed of all
Love, and Loveliness in you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:49838:172"/>
But now let us hearken to the groans of some poor ones among these mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of Souls, who parched and burnt up with their Sins, Sorrows, who
benighted in the Darkness of their unbeleief; yet among all these Millions of
streams of Love, which flow forth upon their Spirits from the heart of God,
among those Millions of Beams of Love, which fall from the Eye of God upon
their hearts dare not take in any one. No, though they thirst for Divine Love
more than for Life, yet shut up their Spirits against all Approaches, or Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of it, as delusions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> These Souls sigh forth this great <hi>Objection</hi> against the Love of God:
You say, the Will of God is love; the object of every Will is some good;
the object of all love is some loveliness. What loveliness can there be in
me to draw the heart of God to me, to be in love with me, who am only
loathsom by my lusts, and deformed by my passions? What good can be found
in me to attract the Divine Will to center itself in me by love, when no good,
but all evil dwelleth in me?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Dear Soul, who thus reasonest for thine own sufferings against
the love of God, I shall give thee three Answers in the behalf, and in the
name of Divine love. O that love itself from the heart of God would drop
its Sweetness from its own mouth upon thee, and seal it upon thy Spirit, while
I am speaking for it to thee!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Thou wert made in the <hi>Image,</hi> and <hi>Likeness</hi> of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. All
<hi>Loveliness</hi> consisteth in <hi>Suitableness; Suitableness</hi> in <hi>Similitude,</hi> and Likeness.
There is nothing, which draweth Hearts and Love, which attracteth all things
so powerfully, as Similitude doth. Similitude is a kind of Unity, and Likeness
Oneness. Similitude is described to be one Form in two matters, or subjects.
Let this, O drooping Soul; raise thee to look upward to that Heaven of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Love, which ever holdeth thee in its Embraces, and shineth round about
thee. The Divine Image, and Similitude is thy proper Person, thine Nature,
thine Essence, it lyeth indeed captivated in chains of Darkness, dishonoured,
and defiled by thy lusts, wounded, and mangled by thy passions, oppressed
with guilt, slain by unbelief in thee. Yet this Divine Image is in thee. It is
thy <hi>true self</hi> according to the first Creation.</p>
            <p>Dost thou ask now, what that good is, which attracteth the Divine Will
to thee by the love of it? God is in love with his own <hi>Likeness</hi> in thee. He
seeketh his own Birth, His Spouse in thee, sprung forth from himself to be his
Joy in the midst of all the Creatures, to be Queen, where ever he is King in
the whole Creation. This Divine Image in thee, this thy Divine self is that
Pearl in the Field, for which God giveth himself, that he may purchase the
Fields. This is that good, to which the heart of God is carried with all its
weight of love, to redeem it, to revive it, to raise it out of the Dust, that it
may shine again in his Glory, and sing of his loves.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> telleth us, <hi>Mat. 24. 28. Where the Carkass is, there the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49838:173"/>
Eagles will be gathered together.</hi> The Scriptures represent the Spirit of God
in its low estate, in the Flesh of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Members by a <hi>Dove,</hi> a <hi>Groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Dove.</hi> The <hi>Dove</hi> is in the clefts of the Rock, and the holes of the Stairs,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 2. The Spirit descended upon Jesus at his Baptism before his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the form of a <hi>Dove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Spirit in his Heavenly strength, and Glory is set forth by an <hi>Eagle.</hi> I
<hi>have born them upon Eagles Wings,</hi> saith God. <hi>They shall mount up on high like
an Eagle;</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Esay.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> is often expressed in the plural
number, because he is that Unity, which is the Spring, the Center, the Circle,
and Band of all blessed Spirits. He hath in himself an endless variety of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Glories, which are all glorious Spirits in him, as he is, and one with him.
whithersoever his Will is to go, they all go together with him. He is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expressed by <hi>seven Lamps, seven Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Eagles</hi> here. Where the
Carcass is, <hi>there the Eagles will be gathered together</hi> The end of all this is to
make way for the letting in of a flood of Heavenly Balsom, of Divine love
upon every heart, upon the broken heart, to heal it; upon the hardest heart
to soften it.</p>
            <p>Eagles from afar, and from on high are drawn to slaughter'd Carcasses, as to
their proper Prey So when the Divine Image lyeth in thee as a loathsome Carcass
at the bottom of a dark and deep Dungeon, now is it the most proper Bait,
and most powerful Attractive of Divine love. Now the Lord Jesus, the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Spirit with all the Troop of Spiritual Powers, and Glories resort to this
Carcass, descend upon it, hunger after it. Now they feed, and feast upon it,
until they have eaten it up, until they have converted it into one pure nature,
and glorious Spirit with themselves.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ignatius</hi> was to be devoured by wild Beasts; <hi>now</hi> saith he, <hi>shall the
Teeth of the Lyons grind me into fine Flower, to make fine Manchet of me for
the Table of God.</hi> So do thou say concerning all thy Sufferings within, and
without: These are the Divine Teeth of the Spirit of Heavenly love. Now
doth my God feed upon me. If my God feed upon me, if he nourish, and
enlarge his own Life, Joys, and Glory by me, then shall he also change me,
take me up into himself, diffuse his own Life, Joys, and Glory into me.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>first Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. Dear Soul, whoever, whatever thou art, thou art the <hi>Off-spring of
God. St. Paul</hi> citeth this from a Poet, confirmeth it by a Divine Testimony, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
it Universally to <hi>all,</hi> maketh it the ground of Evangelical Truths, and
Loves; <hi>Acts 17. 28. As some of your own Poets have said; We are his Off-spring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Paul</hi> hath something very like this, <hi>Ephes. 3. 9. The Gospel was hid
in God from the Foundation of the World, who made all things by Jesus Christ.</hi>
God had the love of the Gospel in his Heart, and sowed it as a secret Seed in
the Foundations of the whole Creation, when he made all things by <hi>Jesus
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:49838:173"/>
Christ. Jesus Christ</hi> is the Seed of Nature, as well as of Grace, and so lyeth hid in the
Bosom of every Creature, as the true Pearl in the Field. That Divine Image,
of which we spake before, was the similitude only, the Mother of Pearl;
This is the Substance, the Pearl itself. In the Off-spring of God is the Seed of
God. Where the Seed of God is, there is God himself in the Vertue, Power,
and fulness of his Divine Nature. For so the Seed of every Plant hath that
Plant Virtually, and Spiritually in it.</p>
            <p>Be now no more unbelieving; but believe. Believe the love, which God
hath to thee. Believe, that all the Inclinations of the Divine Will are to thee;
that the Eye, and heart of God are turned toward thee in every place, fixt
upon thee with all that intention, and force of Sweetness in the Divine Nature.
For why? He is drawn irresistibly to his own Seed, his own Son, his own self
in thee. <hi>Thou art his Off-spring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Micah</hi> was reproved for crying after the Company, he repl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed: <hi>Ye
have carried away my Gods, and ye say; why criest thou after us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No more now doubt, and say; why should the most high God with an Eye
of love from Heaven, thus follow me into every state of life, into all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of my heart? Why should he by a voice of love from Heaven in the
Word, in Providences, in the motions of his Spirit thus cry, and call after me?
Thou hast his Seed, his Son, himself in thee.</p>
            <p>Do thou answer him again, and say: Thou seekest thy self, thy Seed, thy
Sheep crucified, buried, lost in me. O seek, and find it; find it, and take it up
into thine Arms; keep it in thine Arms, till thou bring it home to its own self,
to its lost Life, Joys, and Glories again. But I also seek my Life, my Original,
my true self hid with Christ in thee in the brightness of thy Glory. O take
thy crucified self in me home to thee into thy Bosom. O give me my Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
self with thee home to me into my Bosom. Thus much for the <hi>second An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. Still the wounded Spirit sigheth, and saith: Can God take pleasure in
any thing common, or unclean? Dear Souls, ever dear to the Divine Will,
when you have a sense of Sin or, Love; and when you have none, understand
the Mystery of the Divine Will in the order, and method of Divine love.
When you understand this, you will have a deep, and kindly sense of Sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but so, as to have a righter, and sweeter sense of love by it.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>Twofold Love</hi> in God; a <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Complacency,</hi> or Delight; a
<hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> or good Will. The <hi>first</hi> is that, by which he taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in thee, as a Bridegroom in his beautiful Bride. The second is that, by
which his Will is set on work to make thee beautiful, and a Bride to himself.
The love of Complacency is the first, and the last love. The love of benevolence
is a middle-love, which ariseth out of this, and endeth in it; as Springs, and
Rivers come from the Sea, and run into it.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Order</hi> of Divine love. <hi>First</hi> thou art beloved with a love of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:49838:174"/>
Complacency from Eternity, as thou art seen in that Glass of Eternity, the
Word, the Lord <hi>Jesus. Secondly,</hi> Thou art for this love's sake beloved with a
love of benevolence in time in thine own Person, by which love, God willeth
all good to thee, and worketh all good in thee. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Thou art beloved with
a love of Complacency to Eterni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y in thine own Person, as thou art decked
with all the Ornaments of the Divine Nature. This is the <hi>order</hi> of Divine
love. Its Musick is made up of these <hi>three Parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Part.</hi> Divine-love in the <hi>first Part</hi> is a love of <hi>Complacency,</hi> or Delight
in thee, as thou art seen Eternally in the Person of <hi>Christ.</hi> Dear Soul, while
thou art complaining here below, and fixest thine Eye upon thy shame, thy
God seeth thee all-glorious within, and without in the glorified Person of the
Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> There he taketh his first view of thee. There his Eye, and his
Heart are fixt Eternally to thee. Here he maketh choice of thee, here he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in love with thee, and his Soul resteth with perfect delight in thee. For
he beholdeth thee, as a spectacle of all Divine loveliness lying in the Bosom
of him, who is the brightness of all Divine Glory. As a Vessel in the Sea is
filled with the Waters, and overflown with the same Waters: so art thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the World was in the Person of thy <hi>Jesus,</hi> as in a Sea of Spiritual, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Beauties; all full within, all covered without with these Glories; quite
thorow transparent with the riches of their lustre; entirely swallowed up into
the Sea of these pure, and bright Glories. This is <hi>Electing Love,</hi> of which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh; <hi>Ephes. 1. He hath made us acceptable in the beloved one.</hi> It
is a significant expression which no language can answer for the Sweetness, and
Fulness of it; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>made acceptable.</hi> The phrase hath this force in it.
God embraceth thee with the Arms of the dearest, and tenderest loves, finding
thee entirely cloathed, and encircled with the height of all loveliness in the
object of all loves, and the first s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at, the essence itself of all lovelinesses the
Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> His Soul is well-pleased with thee to the utmost of all Content;
he hath his fill of Pleasures in thee, enjoying thee in the Center of all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnesses,
his own Son.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Part.</hi> D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vine love in the <hi>second Part</hi> is a love of <hi>Benevolence.</hi> While
thou art a desolate Wilderness, where nothing appeareth but Dearth, and
Drouth, but Bush, and Brake, the love of Eternity descendeth, and soweth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as a Heavenly Seed in thee. It cometh down in Heavenly Showers. It
breaketh forth in Heavenly Sun-shines upon thee. The same love springeth up
into all manner of Spiritual loveliness in thee. Now the Grass groweth, the
Roes, and the Hinds play, where the Dragon lay. The Bramble bringeth
forth Roses. The Stony Heart is now made the Garden of God. The Soul
which wallowed in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ilth of the Devil is washed by Eternal love in its own
Blood, redeemed by its own life, made to bear the Fruit of its own loveliness,
and ready trimmed for a Bride to itself.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Part.</hi> Divine love in the <hi>third Part</hi> is a love of Complacency, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:49838:174"/>
in thee in thine own Person: Now Heaven is opened to thee. God with
all his holy Angels are continually descending, and ascending between Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and thine Heart, which is become as it were another Heaven on Earth,
<hi>God resteth in his Love to thee, and rejoyceth with singing over thee.</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-feast
of the Lamb, and his Bride is kept in thee, and thou art that Bride.
God with all his loves resteth in thy Bosom. All his desires, who is infinite,
are terminated in thee. All his delights are consummated in thee. All the
Quires of Angels round about sing of his love to thee. All his Excellencies,
and Glories, all his works on every side sing for his Joy in thee.</p>
            <p>Ah! Dear Souls! When God shall thus bring back your Captivity, how
will your Mouths be filled with laughter! How will you be, as those that
Dream? But why should these glad Tydings seem to you too good, too great
to be true. God is able to do all this for you, and in you. For his Power is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.
God is as willing, as he is able. For his Power lyeth in his Will, and
his Will is Love. Only wait thou for him; and keep thine Eye upon the
first Link in the Golden Chain of Divine love, which is fastned to the Throne
of God, the Person of <hi>Christ</hi> in Heaven, above all thy frailties, folly, and
filths, before thy Being in Flesh. This Link is that, which draweth after it the
other two inseparably, and infallibly.</p>
            <p>This is the Circle of Heavenly love. <hi>First,</hi> God loveth thee in Eternity
with that love, with which he loveth the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> For he beholdeth thee in the
light of the same loveliness, in which he beholdeth <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ. <hi>Then</hi> he
bringeth down the Treasure of this love, and loveliness, which is his beloved
Son into thee, soweth him, as a Seed of the Divine Nature, and Sonship. He
springeth up in thee, transformeth thee into his own likeness, groweth up in
an inseparable Union, and Fellowship with thee. Now God hath another Son,
in which he seeth his Son in conjunction on Earth, as he saw them before in
conjunction in Heaven. <hi>Lastly,</hi> God embraceth this Son on Earth, in whom
he seeth his Son. He giveth him the kiss of a Father, with all the Joys of a
Father. He taketh him into his Arms, carrieth him up into Heaven changing
him still, as he carrieth him up, till this Union begun below, be at last made
perfect in, and swallowed up into that Union, which was at first in Eternity.
Then shall the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> see himself in a Saint after the same manner, in
which a Saint is seen in the Lord Jesus; both being made perfect in Each, and
all made perfect in one. Follow on to know the Lord, and his love, and ye
shall know this love of the Lord.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Use.</hi> See the Evil of <hi>sin</hi> upon two Accounts. <hi>First</hi> Sin is an <hi>Aberration</hi>
from the Will of God. <hi>Secondly</hi> Sin is an <hi>Opposition</hi> to that Will.</p>
            <p>1. The first Evil of Sin is, that is it an <hi>Aberration</hi> from the Will of God.
The Will of God is love. In every Sinful path thou losest the <hi>Love-Presence</hi> of
thy God. What is this <hi>Love-Presence</hi> and what is thy loss in being deprived of
it? In the Love-P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esence of God are these Things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:49838:175"/>
1. A <hi>Light of Glory</hi> shining round about thee. This Light of Glory cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth
thy Person all over with its living lustre, as with a Garment of pure
Gold, of Divine Loveliness. This Light layeth all things open, and naked to
thee in their Heavenly Beauties, in their Eternal Truths, and Substances. This
light is a mutual Union, and Fellowship between thee, and all things in the
light, all the Children of light, all Spirits, and Forms of light. This light is
a Spiritual Paradise, in which thou springest up, and flourishest, as a Plant,
and Flower of light. This Divine Light is a new Wine, which thou continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
drinkest in, and art filled with pure Spirits of all Life, Excellency, Loves
and Joys. Lastly, This pleasant, and triumphant Light chaseth away all the
shadows, all the darkness, deceits, melancholy, and fears of the Night.</p>
            <p>2. In the <hi>Love-Presence</hi> is the Face of God unvailed, naked, and smiling.
God is as a King, and a Bridegroom, in his Ivory Palace. Thou art, as his
Queen, and Bride at his Right hand in Garments of Needle-work wrought
by the Eternal Spirit with all manner of Beautiful, and Delightful Flowers,
and Figures. Here they make these two glad with all manner of Pleasures, as
on their Marriage-day.</p>
            <p>3. An <hi>innumerable company of Angels</hi> make up this <hi>Love-Presence.</hi> These
are thy guard. They continually encircle thee, and encamp round about thee
in every place by night, and by day. Which way soever thou goest, they
bear thee in their arms. They go before thee, to make smooth paths for thy
Feet, and to prepare a resting place for thee. They contend with all the Powers
of Darkness in thy behalf, for thy Body itself, even in Death. They make
Peace for thee with the Beasts of the Field, and a Covenant for thee with the
Stones of the Earth in the name of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and by the Mystery of
the Gospel. The darkest Appearances of things have the face of Pleasure itself,
and put on Immortal Beauties for thee. The hardest things soften into Spirits
of Life, and Love, flow with Springs of love, and delights for thee.</p>
            <p>4. The God-Head itself encompasseth thee with a Ring of unapproachable
Powers, and Incomprehensible Glories, like the Mountains round about <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
Himself becometh unto thee the Habitation of a Rock, the Rock of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
and Glory. Himself is thy King, thy Kingdom, thy Palace, thy strong
Tower; thy safety, thy rest, and thy pleasure. In this Divine strength, in this
Divine secret no evil can come near thee, no good can ever fail thee, neither
the Bread of thy strength, and life, nor the living Waters of thy Loves, Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Joys.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Love-Presence</hi> of God. This is drawn in, and withdraweth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from thee in the same degrees, as sin is entertained in thy Spirit and Life.</p>
            <p>Evil is a Privation of Good. How great an Evil then is the least sin, which
depriveth thee of the best, and greatest good the <hi>Love-Presence</hi> of thy God?
<hi>Blessed are the pure in Heart,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>they shall see God. Mat.</hi> 5.
How cursed are the Impure? Wo to the filthy, and unclean. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:49838:175"/>
to the loss of the sight of this God, and the sense of his Love, which
sight, which sense alone enlighten, alone sweeten Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the Will of God, your Sanctification.</hi> The <hi>Will,</hi> and the <hi>Love</hi> of God
are one. While you stand in a holy Temper, and State, you stand in the Will
of God, you stand in the Love-visions, and Love-embraces of God. What a
horrour should you have for every Sin, which cometh to snatch these blessed
visions of Love from before your Eyes, and you from the midst of these em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
of love?</p>
            <p>When the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> died, the Sun was entirely darkned besides the course
of Nature, the Rocks were rent asunder, the Earth shook, and trembled, the
Graves were opened, and the Dead came forth. How dreadful, and dismal
a thing would Sin appear, if we met with so unnatural, affrighting a Change
as this, upon the act, or meditation of every Sin? But the change is far more
tragical, and mournful, if we saw it with the Eyes of our mind, as indeed it is.</p>
            <p>Upon the arising of each Lust in thee to gain thy Will from the Bosom of
thy Will. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is spiritually slain in thee, who hath a Twin-life with
thy life, while thou livest in the Divine Will. This is a Death far more dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than that in his Flesh. Now that light of Glory is extinguished in thy
Spirit, which shineth ten thousand times brighter, and sweeter, than the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer-Sun.
Now the Rocks the Divine Powers round about thee, rend asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and remove out of their places. Hell is opened. All things round about
thee are Apparitions from beneath; evil Spirits walking in all Forms of things.
The whole frame, and face of Nature is full of Darkness, and uncertainty,
Tremblings, and Horrour. The whole Image of things within thee, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
is changed from a <hi>Love-Presence</hi> to a spectacle of Wrath, and Vengeance.</p>
            <p>O that Men understood, and would believe the Evil of Sin, of a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the Divine Will, which is a Sea of Love, to their own Will, which
is a dark fire of Lust burning up into an open Hell. But though they neither
understand, nor believe it; yet is it true, and they feel it to be so.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Second Evil of Sin</hi> is an <hi>opposition</hi> to the Divine Will, that is, to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love. But can any oppose unclean Lusts to so pure a Love? Earthly, Hellish
Lusts to so Heavenly a Love? Fleshly Lusts to a spiritual Love, a Love, which is the
Life, and Immortality of all Blessed Spirits? Can any oppose raging passions to the
meekness, and sweet Calm of Divine Love? Can any set themselves against that
Love which wooeth them continually, till it win them, which doth all things for
them? Can any so cast shame upon that Love, which poureth forth itself, as a
sweet-smelling Ointment of all Grace, and Beauty upon their Heads, and Persons?
Are any hearts to be found so hard, that they will wound Eternal Love itself,
while it is pouring forth the Life-Blood of its own heart, partly for a Divine
Bathto wash us w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>? All this we do, while by Sin we walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Divine Will, which is all Love, Love framing all contrivances,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:49838:176"/>
casting itself into all Forms in Heaven, on the Earth, under the Earth, acting
all parts of Life, and Death for us, to gain us, and to crown us with all its
Joys, and Beauties. O how uningenuous, how unnatural a thing is Sin? O take
heed of trusting the comforts of your lives, the life of your Souls, the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of your Relations to it.</p>
            <p>The foundations of Heaven, and Earth are not so firm, as that of this
Truth: <hi>The greatest Evil of Suffering is to be chosen a thousand times, rather
than the least Evil of Sin.</hi> In the midst of all other Evils thy Will may stand
in a Love-Union with the Divine Will, which is the only Paradise of Delights, and
Beauties, that never fade. In every Evil of Sin thy Will standeth in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and enmity to the Divine Will, which enmity alone is the Center of Hell,
where all its blackness of dark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ess, all its unquenchable fires, all its innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
furies, forms of torment rise up into it.</p>
            <p>Our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in his Agony, on the Cross, in all his Sufferings had a Joy
set before him. The Wrath of his Father with all its Tempests, which shook
Heaven, and Earth was a spectacle of Divine Love, and Joy set before him.
For in all this his Fathers Will was done by him. His Will was tuned to his
Fathers Will. So the Harmony, and Musick of Divine Love plaid in the Ear
of his Spirit thorow all. His Will was an excellent Lute, the more it was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the more sweetly it returned all that Musick.</p>
            <p>On the other side all the pleasures of Sin, all the Glories of the Creature to
a sinful Soul are only a scene of Heaven in Hell. For the Will standeth in a
Contrariety to the Divine Will, which is the Supream Love, and Joy. What
can the Contrariety to the Supream Love; and Joy be, but the deplorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams
of Wrath, and Torment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 2. The Will of God declareth itself to be Love, to this end, that you
may not sin by departing from it: but if any man do sin, that he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
return. <hi>Saul</hi> was softned, and melted, when he heard the language of
love from <hi>David,</hi> who had watched over him to preserve him, while he slept
in the midst of that Army, with which he made War upon him: <hi>Is this thy
voice my Son David?</hi> said he then. Open thine Eyes, see the Divine Will
with innumerable Eyes of love watching over thee in the midst of thy rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.
Open thine Ears, hear the Divine Will wooing thee with the sweetest
language of love in the midst of thy pollutions. This will turn thee again to
the Will of God to melt thy self into its Bosom, when once this thought ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in thee, that thou returnest to a Bosom of love ever open to thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 3. Be in love with Holiness. Holiness is a Conformity to the Will of
God. This Will is Love. How easy is that Yoak? How light is the Burthen?
How pleasant is the Law of Love? <hi>Keep my Commandment, and abide ye in
my Love, even as I abide in my Fathers Love,</hi> saith <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> To abide
in the Divine Will, to keep the Commandments of that, is to abide in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
of Divine love, to dress it, and keep it. <hi>David</hi> saith of the Law of the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:49838:176"/>
Lord, <hi>Psal. 19. It is more to be desired, than thousands of Gold, and Silver. It
is sweeter than the Honey, and the Honey-comb. In keeping it is exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
Hear, O beloved Souls and be wise, and be in love with Holiness. In
every command to Holiness God cometh to you in the Light, and Purity of
all his Divine Beauties, in the Strength, and Sweetness of all his Divine loves,
to make thee like himself, to marry thee to himself. In every act of obedience
to this law of Holiness, thy Person shineth with a Heavenly lustre by the shining
forth of the unvailed Person of God upon thee: thou receivest a kiss of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
love immediately from the Mouth of God, and returnest it again. O
tast, and see. Then you will say, that this Heavenly Traffick is beyond that
of all precious, of all pleasant things. No where such loveliness, as this; no
where such love. Holiness is a Conformity to the Will of God. The Will
of God is Love, the Fountain, and the Life of all Incorruptible Beauties, of all
pure, and ever-flourishing Pleasures.</p>

be the <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Essence</hi> of God. <hi>God,</hi> saith he, <hi>is Love. He that dwelleth in

Heavenly Musick of this <hi>Psalm,</hi> I do not doubt to make your hearts in your
Bosoms to leap, and dance to it, by that time I have done.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Take</hi> two general Observations <hi>concerning</hi> this Psalm.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Gener. Observ.</hi> This is a <hi>Psalm</hi> of <hi>Praises,</hi> and Thanksgivings; the
Work of Heaven, a Heavenly Work. But all the Praises here are attributed
to, all the Thanksgivings are terminated in Love, and the Eternity of Love.
This is the burthen of the Song repeated in every verse; this is that, into which
all the Strength, and Sweetness of the sense is still resolved; this maketh one
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:49838:177"/>
half of every <hi>verse</hi> quite thorow the whole Psalm: <hi>For his Mercy endureth
for ever.</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> signifieth alike, <hi>Mercy, Kindness, Love.</hi> That
word, <hi>endureth,</hi> is added by the Translatours. You may read the words with
as full an agreement with the Original, as I humbly conceive, <hi>For his Love is
Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however this be, if we adhere to the Translation; <hi>Mercy</hi> is one of
the sweetest, tenderest, largest names of Divine love.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Mercy</hi> is <hi>Love</hi> condescending, and descending from the heights of all
Heavens above to the nethermost parts of the Earth, to the nethermost Hell.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Mercy</hi> is <hi>Love</hi> uniting itself to the vilest, and most miserable Creatures, which
lie below, which stick in the Mire, and Clay in the bottom of the Pit. There
love sympathizeth with them, maketh itself entirely one with them in their
low estate.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Mercy</hi> is <hi>Love</hi> making a mutual and strange exchange with those loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
and lost Souls. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> taketh to itself their guilt, shame, weakness, and woes.
It giveth to them its own Righteousness, Strength, Beauties, Joys, and Glories.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Mercy</hi> is the circle of Divine love, as it cometh forth from Heaven,
and Eternity; goeth down to the lowest depths of Time, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
then ascendeth again, till like the Sun it return thither, where it first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose.
Poor, and broken Spirits, who lie at the utmost ends of the Earth mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
as outcasts; hope evermore in Eternal love, wait for it. The love of
God will find you out, it will meet with you, and take you in its way. For
Divine love is Eternal. It encompasseth Heaven, and Earth; Time and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<hi>His Mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Gener. Observ.</hi> This <hi>Psalm</hi> comprehendeth all things in it, <hi>Created,</hi>
or <hi>Uncreated;</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> of God; the <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Christ;</hi> the
<hi>Wonders</hi> of God; the <hi>Works</hi> of God; the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Nature, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi>
It comprehendeth all things. Then it maketh the <hi>ground,</hi> and Crown of all to
be <hi>Love;</hi> this is brought in to every particular in each verse, as the <hi>Reason,
Rule, Result</hi> of all: <hi>For his Mercy endureth for ever; for his love is Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a maxime in Nature, that <hi>all motion is founded upon something un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.</hi>
This is the Divine Maxime, upon which Heaven, and Earth
standeth; all motions in the heart of God, and in the Creature;
of Grace, and Nature are founded upon the unmoveableness, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableness
of eternal Love.</p>
            <p>O blessed Love! O blessed God, who is this love! O blessed Soul, which
with a spiritual Eye created by this love seeth this all, this whole frame of
things to be a structure, a composure of Divine Love! Eternal Love rising
up into a Temple, which itself filleth with its All-powerful presence and God-Head,
figuring itself in all Forms; acting all Parts; dwelling, and conversing
with us, with itself in us, and in all things.</p>
            <p>Wandring Souls, take what wings you will to your selves, you can never
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:49838:177"/>
fly from the Face, from the Bosom of this Love. The Face of Divine Love
shineth thorow all things. The Bosom of Love is the Nest, in which all things,
lie. He that hath an Eye to see this Love; he that hath a Palate to rellish it, feeleth
and feedeth upon a Heavenly Sweetness dropping from the Divine Nature thorow
all Objects, thorow all his Senses, as that Honey from the Rock of Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These are the</hi> two general observations. <hi>I come now to the parts of the</hi> Psalm
<hi>which are</hi> three; 1. God. 2. <hi>The</hi> Wonders. 3. The Works of God.</p>
            <p>1. Part; God. <hi>This</hi> Part <hi>hath</hi> three Particulars. 1. <hi>The</hi> Nature <hi>of</hi> God.
2. <hi>The</hi> Person <hi>of the</hi> Father. 3. <hi>The</hi> Person <hi>of</hi> Christ.</p>
            <p>1. Partic. <hi>The</hi> Nature <hi>of</hi> God is Love. O give thanks unto the Lord, for
he is good; for his Mercy endureth for ever. v. 1. Goodness <hi>is the</hi> Nature <hi>of
God. All the</hi> Goodness <hi>of God consisteth in his</hi> Love, <hi>and the unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Eternity of that. The Lord</hi> Iesus <hi>teacheth us in the Gospel, that</hi>
there is none good, but one, that is God. <hi>God alone is</hi> good essentially, <hi>and so
primitively, and so perfectly, infinitely good. For nothing can limit, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
itself. Goodness is in each Creature, as an</hi> accident <hi>only. In God it is his</hi>
essence. <hi>The</hi> essence <hi>of God</hi> is goodness, <hi>The</hi> essence of goodness <hi>is</hi> Love, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Love. O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his Mercy endureth
for ever, his Love is Eternal. <hi>The</hi> Reason, <hi>or</hi> Object <hi>in God of all Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings
is his</hi> goodness, <hi>The</hi> Formal Reason, <hi>the</hi> Essence <hi>of his</hi> goodness <hi>is his</hi>
Love.</p>
            <p>As we pass, let us make four short <hi>Notes</hi> upon this <hi>Particular.</hi> 1. Faith in
the Soul is to be the Counterpart of Love in God. How large then should out
Faith be, which is to answer so great a Love? All the goodness of God lyeth
in his Love. The Essence of God, which is so incomprehensible, so infinite is
Love. The Heart of God, the Divine Nature is all Love. O that our
Hearts, our Souls, our whole Being were all one Mouth of Faith, and that
Mouth opening itself still wider and wider to take in these Seas of Divine
Love. 2. The goodness of the Divine Nature is Love. The Seed then of all
goodness in us is Divine Love. Let us never say; the Evil of my Heart, and
Life keep me from the Fountain of Love in the Heart of God. If I were
good, with what Freedom should I come to it? With what desire, delight
should I drink of it? Take in this Love, that thou mayst be good. This is
the beautiful Flower, and ripe Fruit of the Divine Nature in the Creator.
This is the Immortal, and precious Seed of the Divine Nature in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Partic.</hi> The <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Father is Love. O give thanks unto the God
of Gods; for his Mercy endureth for ever, v.</hi> 2. The ground upon which I Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the <hi>God of Gods</hi> in this <hi>verse</hi> to be the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> in the
following verse to be <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> is the Authority of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in the
<hi>New Testament,</hi> who often distinguisheth these two ever-blessed Persons by
these several Titles of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Lord. St. Peter</hi> saith of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:49838:178"/>
               <hi>Acts; Him hath God made both Lord, and King. St. Paul</hi> saith; <hi>There is one
God the Father, of whom are all things, and we of him. There is one Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
by whom are all things, and we by him.</hi> The Holy Apostle seemeth here
by the name of <hi>God</hi> to understand the <hi>Fountain</hi> of things; by that of <hi>Lord,</hi>
the <hi>Channel.</hi> In another place he speaketh in like manner: <hi>There are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of Administrations, but the same Lord. There are diversities of operations,
but the same God, who worketh all in all: God</hi> is the Original of all Power;
<hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the great, and universal Administrator, the supream Minister in
all the Affairs of the God-Head, and so the Lord.</p>
            <p>But to return; the excellency by which God the Father infinitely surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
all the Gods, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll Powers, Greatnesses, and Glories is Eternal Love. The
Soveraignty, by which he reigneth over, ruleth, rideth forth upon all the
Gods, all Powers, Greatnesses, and Glories is Eternal Love. The Fountain of the
Father, from which he bringeth forth the highest Spirits, Angels, and Saints
into the Heavenly Image, and Form of God, that they all become, as Sons of
God, as Gods round about the Throne of the God of Gods, the Father of
them all; this Fountain is Eternal Love. O ye Saints! O ye Souls, whom God
hath created, and brought forth from a Seed of Love in Eternity, lay your
Mouth to this breast of Love, suck in abundantly the pure Milk of Eternal
Love, that you may nourish the Divine Nature, and grow up into the Form of
God by it. What do we make our selves, when we cast off Divine Love,
when we cease to love? We cast off the Divine Nature, and become Devils.
The God of Gods, the Fountain of the Divine Nature, the Father of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Life, and Image in Angels, and men hath all his Praises for his Love, he
hath his vertue, perfections, and preheminence all consisting in his Love, and
the Eternity of that. <hi>O give thanks unto the God of Gods: for his Mercy endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for ever: for his Love is Eternal. v.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>3. Part. The Person of Christ is Love. O give thanks unto the Lord of Lords:
for his Mercy endureth for ever. <hi>The Kingdom of</hi> Christ <hi>is a Kingdom of Love.
All the Praises of his Reign are terminated in everlasting mercies, the kindnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Eternity. As</hi> Iesus Christ <hi>is the Lord</hi> of Life, <hi>and</hi> Prince of Glory; <hi>so is
he also the</hi> Lord, <hi>and</hi> Prince <hi>of</hi> Love.</p>
            <p>The Headship of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> over all Principalities, and Powers is the
Well-head of love. Our Saviour, as he is the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Father, by which
he conducteth all things, is a love-channel, the way of love, a contrivance,
design, and mystery of love. As he is the <hi>Power</hi> of God, which carrieth on
all, so he is a flood of love pouring forth itself into this channel, and running
along thorow it, filling all the windings, and turnings of the Creation, and of
Providence.</p>
            <p>Who would not worship thee, O thou King of Saints! O thou King of
loves! Who would not kiss this Son with a kiss of Allegiance, and be a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in this Kingdom; where the King, and the Kingdom both are love. The
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:49838:178"/>
sharpest reproof here is a kiss of love. The deepest wounding is an anointing
of love. The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in this sense also is the King of Kings, the Lord of
Lords. All his Subjects are Fellow-Lord, Fellow-King together with himself,
sitting together upon one Throne, which is a <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> Throne of
love, love findeth, or maketh an equality.</p>
            <p>I have passed thorow the <hi>first part</hi> of the <hi>Psalm,</hi> which is the <hi>God of love</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Part. The Wonders of love. To him, who alone doth great Wonders: for
his Mercy endureth for ever, or his love is Eternal, v. 4. <hi>All the wonders
of God are wonders of love. God is in nothing so to be admired, as in his
love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Admiration is imperfect knowledge. Those things are wonders to us, which
are incomprehensible, the causes, and natures of which we cannot search out,
or reach to. What Joy is this to understand, that all that, which we cannot
understand in the nature of things, which is, as a thick darkness round about
us, is a glorious mystery of Divine love? That all that every where, of every
Creature, of every Providence of the Creator himself, in which our Spirits are
swallowed up, and lost is an abyss of love, a great, and shining deep of Divine
love?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He who thinketh, he knoweth any thing,</hi> saith <hi>St. Paul, knoweth nothing, as
he ought to know.</hi> How wise, how right, how pleasant is this, to know, that we
have a perfect, a right knowledge of nothing, that all things may become
wonders of love to us; that the less we see, the more we may feel of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
pleasure in the admirations, and raptures of Divine love transcending our
highest faculties; that where we cannot comprehend things, we may give up
our selves to be comprehended by an incomprehensible love?</p>
            <p>The Body of the Sun cannot be seen, but daz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eth, and darkneth our sight,
when we fix our Eyes upon it. The Stars are said to be vast Bodies of Light,
and Glory. Yet we see nothing of them, but little twinklings, and sparks.
The reason in one is the excess of Light; in the other the excess of Height.
Believe it; all things round about us are Stars, and Suns of Divine love; love
in Divine Forms of a transcendent magnitude, and lustre. But we see them
generally in a dusky, and shadowy Appearance, like the Sky at a great dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
or at best as little sparks, and twinklings of love. Our sight faileth by
reason of the greatness of the Glory, and its height above us.</p>
            <p>I come now from the <hi>second</hi> to the <hi>third part</hi> of the <hi>Psalm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Part. The works of love. <hi>All the</hi> works <hi>of</hi> God <hi>are</hi> works <hi>of</hi> love. <hi>The
works of God, and of love are of</hi> three sorts; works of Nature; works of Grace;
works of Glory.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Works of Nature.</hi> These are summed up in the Principal, and Universal
parts, which comprehend all the rest, <hi>v.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8, 9. The <hi>Heaven,</hi> the
<hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Day,</hi> the <hi>Night,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>Stars</hi> are mentioned. To
every one of these distinctly is annexed that close, and Crown of love; for <hi>His
Mercy endureth for ever; or his love is Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:49838:179"/>
The whole frame of things is a Creation of love. All the Creatures are so
many Forms, and Shapes, which love putteth on to appear to us in, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
to sport itself with us. If it take to itself the Glory of a King in the
discovery of itself by the light of the <hi>day:</hi> it taketh to itself a greater Glory,
and affordeth a greater pleasure by surmounting all our Powers, and being
incomprehensible, when it hideth itself in the darkness of the <hi>Night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Love is the Center of the <hi>Earth</hi> beneath, on which the whole Creation
resteth and moveth. Love is the Circle of Heaven above, which encompasseth
all.</p>
            <p>It is Divine love, which rideth upon the Circuit of the Heavens,
of all the Heavenly Spirits, and Heavenly Bodies, ruling all
things by its blessed, and sweet influences from thence. It is Divine love, which
soweth itself, as a Seed in every dust of the Earth, to spring up from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Divine Form and Fruit. The Sun is a Figure of Eternal love shining
forth with its naked Beauties in their full Glory. In the Moon we see love
shadowed, and coming forth with its Night-dress to rule, and enlighten every
night, the blackest, the most tempestuous. The Stars are innumerable Eyes of
Love looking forth upon us, watching over us, attracting our Spirits, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up to Heaven, to the Fountain of love. They are so many sparks of
love flying forth from the Heart of God, and glowing continually round about
us to warm, and melt our Hearts.</p>
            <p>Can we now keep dark, blind, cold, unkind, unclean, dead hearts in our
Bosoms in the midst of a Creation of love, where so many Eyes of love shine
so sweetly upon us, so many sparks of love lie glowing round about us, so
many Seeds of love are sown in our Earth, so many influences of love are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
falling from the Heavens on every side.</p>
            <p>The heat of the Sun warmeth stone-walls, quickneth slime to a living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
You that have hearts of stone in your Bosoms, lay them open to the
Beams of his love, they will be warmed with a Heavenly heat, they will live the
life of Angels, of God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>work</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> is to be annexed to the <hi>Creation</hi> among the works
of <hi>Nature.</hi> The work of <hi>Providence</hi> is painted out to us in the Nation of
the <hi>Jesus,</hi> as in a Figure from the <hi>tenth verse</hi> to the <hi>twenty third,</hi> as the Soul
formeth, animateth, and inhabiteth the Body; as the Soul is all in the whole
Body, and all in every part of it: so is Eternal love the Spring, the Life,
the Sweetness, the Beauty residing in the whole work of Providence, and resting
entirely on each l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne, each motion of it. Every particular in <hi>each verse</hi> is set
off with this love, as the ground, the glory, and the rellish of all: <hi>For his
Mercy endureth for ever: or, his love is Eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a Silkworm spinneth a soft, and shining piece of work out of its Bowels,
in the midst of which it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>f liveth, and dyeth to live again with Wings, and
multiply itself: so is the whole piece of Nature, and Providence a rich, and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:49838:179"/>
delicate contexture of the tenderest Love. Eternal Love spinneth it out of its
own Bowels, liveth with us, and dyeth for us in the midst of it. Then it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
again with Wings of Spirituality, and Glory. In this Divine Form it
cometh again to generate a Divine Seed to itself.</p>
            <p>A Painter, who is drawing a Beautiful Person, keepeth his Eye ever upon
the Life. Whether he lay dark or bright Colours, whether he make Shade,
or Light, crooked lines, straight or circular: still he is acted by that Idea of
Beauty, which he taketh into his Spirit by his Eye from the Life itself; still
he is forming that lovely Face in every stroke, and colour. Thus Divine Love
in the whole Age of the World, in the life of a particular Saint, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Affairs of the Church sometimes maketh a Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> sometimes a
Passage out of it; here a red Sea, there a way thorow it; now a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
then a Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> But in all these it ever hath its Eye upon that
Divine Glory, which Eternal Love bringeth forth to itself, within itself, as its
own Essential Form and Image. This Glory, this Life-Image of Love, is
that, which it is forming in every <hi>Aegypt,</hi> Sea, Wilderness, and Canaan.</p>
            <p>The Heathen represented the <hi>Nature</hi> of this thing by <hi>Venus,</hi> the Mother of
Love; the Seeds, and Life springing by a <hi>Cupid,</hi> Love the Child of this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 2. It is said that the Spirit of God moved upon the Waters.
The Paraphrase upon that Scripture maketh it to be an allusion to a <hi>Dove,</hi>
which is the Bird of love sitting upon her Eggs, and hatching her young ones.
The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is often in Scriptures represented by a <hi>Dove.</hi> Eternal Love is
of a Truth, that Almighty Spirit, which at first sate upon the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to form it, and moveth upon it thorow all times to cherish, and govern it.
<hi>Love</hi> is the Mother of all above. All things are the Off-spring of Love, a
Race of Seminal, and Springing Loves. Mercy, Love runneth along with
the whole, with each particular of the whole thorow the length of Eternity
itself. This is still the Burthen of the Song: <hi>For his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Works of Grace.</hi> These are the <hi>second sort of Divine Works;</hi> and
these also are the Works of <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are divided into <hi>three Ranks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>The constant abode of the Soul in the Heart of God. Who remembred us in our
low estate. v.</hi> 23. Thou, O broken Heart! Art sinking by ignorance, by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
by thy fall from God, thou art sinking still deeper into the Darkness, and
Filth of this World, and thy Lusts. Still thou sinkest into the Power, and
Horrours of the Devil. Now thou sayest; the Lord hath forgotten me, he hath
cast me off for ever. Yet he <hi>remembreth thee in thy low estate.</hi> Still thou art
in his Thoughts, thou art in his Heart, as a Pillar in the Temple of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, which is Love, never to go forth. Thy Person is ever before
him with a Sweet and deep Impression upon his Spirit never to be rased out.
What hath done this? It is Eternal Love. This is the Light of the Divine
Mind, which continually presenteth thee to it in the dress of its own Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uties.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:49838:180"/>
This is the sweet force of the Divine Will, which holdeth thee fast in itself,
which beareth thee in its Arms thorow all conditions, and will not let thee go
for ever. This is the Reason, why <hi>He remembreth thee in thy low estate: For
his Mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The bringing us back into the Bosom of God. <hi>This is the</hi> second Rank <hi>in
the</hi> Works of Grace. And hath redeemed us from our Enemies: For his Mercy
endureth for ever. v. 24.</p>
            <p>It is Eternal Love in the Bosom of the Father, which hath sent <hi>Jesus</hi>
Christ forth from thence for us, and to us; that he may be our Sacrifice,
our Ransom, and our Redeemer.</p>
            <p>It is Eternal Love in the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> which cometh down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to make itself a Sacrifice for us to the Justice, and Wrath of God.</p>
            <p>It is Eternal Love in the Person of our <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ellencies
of God serve his Love. 3. God resteth in his Love.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>All the Works of God end in Love.</hi> Psal. 145. <hi>v. 9. His tender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are over all his Works.</hi> The word <hi>Mercies</hi> cometh from the <hi>Belly; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts;</hi> the <hi>Womb.</hi> It signifieth the very heart of Love, where it first
liveth, and never dieth. where it lyeth warmest, and hath the strongest pulse.
It signifieth Love in its Center, and Fountain, where its operations are tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
liveliest, and highest. It signifieth that the dearest of all Loves, the love
of a Mother to the Child of her Womb. <hi>This Love is over all the Works of
God. Over</hi> in Hebrew hath also the sense of <hi>Above.</hi> It is the <hi>end</hi> alone,
which is <hi>over</hi> all, and <hi>above</hi> all. In these two respects Love appeareth to be
the end of all the Works of God.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Love is over all the Works of God.</hi> As a Bird spreadeth itself over its
Nest to hatch, and cherish its young ones: So the end spreadeth itself over
all the means, and ways to it. The end fashioneth, and formeth them. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
end directeth and moveth them. The end putteth a Beauty upon them, and a
pleasantness into them. The end terminateth, and perfecteth them in itself. Thus
Divine Love, as the Heavenly Dove, maketh the whole compass of things its
Nest, and sitteth upon it. Love giveth Being, Form, Motion, Light, Life,
Loveliness, Perfection to all the Works of God. Love is the consummatior,
and Crown of all. Thus love is the last end.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Love is above all the Works of God.</hi> Nothing can be above all besides
the end of all. The end of all boundeth all things and confineth them. Eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h

               </gap>d
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:49838:181"/>
confine it. Divine Love is the end of all good, the measure of all good, an
infinite good. For the love of God is above all the Works of God. O the
transcendent Sweetness, Suitableness, Goodness of Divine Love! When you
have extracted all that is sweet, all that is agreeable, all that is good out of
every Creature, every Divine Work; the Love of God is sweeter, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than all this. Yea, there is in this Love a sweetness, which so much excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth;
which is so quite of another kind; that by all this you can take no measure
of it, you can make no conjecture of it. For all this is finite, and that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.
Now it is a firm and sure Rule: there is no proportion between a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
and an infinite Being. You must tast this Love itself to know how precious
it is. All the delights here, when they are highest, truest, and purest are
dreams only of this Love. Awake, O Soul, and dress thy self to be a Bride to
this Love. Stir up all those infinite desires, which are sown in thee to meet,
embrace, and take in the infinite excellency, the infinite Sweetness of this
Love.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>All the Attributes, and Excellencies of God serve his Love;</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<hi>Love</hi> to be the <hi>end</hi> of all. We read thus, <hi>Ephes. 1. 5, 6. Who hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated
us to the adoption of Sons by Jesus Christ in himself according to the
good pleasure of his will to the praise of the Glory of his Grace.</hi> Grace is Love
with these three Graces adorning it, Freedom, Sweetness, Fulness. See if this
Love be not God himself, to which the Praise and Glory is given. Can this
be any other, than God in his last, and naked Appearance, the end of all, to
which the Praise, and Glory of all is ascribed? Behold, with what Pomp Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love is brought in. A long order of Divine Glories go before it. Love
followeth them, as King, and God. 1. The Counsels of God in Eternity
comprehended in the head of them all predestination; <hi>Who hath predestinated
us.</hi> 2. The Adoption, the Sonship, all the Sons of God. 3. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the brightness of the Glory of God, by whom all the world Visible, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible;
of Nature, Grace, and Glory are made; in whom all the Fulness of
the God-Head dwelleth Bodily. 4. The Will of God, which is the unsear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable
Treasure of all Sweetness, Goodness, Power, and Joy; the Seed, and
Fruit of all Desires thorow Earth, and Heaven. Yea the good pleasure of his
Will, which the Will of God, like the Sun shining in its strength, or a full
Sea. All these in their Order serve to the Praise of the Glory of Divine
Love. <hi>Who hath predestinated us to the Adoption of Sonship by Jesus Christ in
Himself according to the good pleasure of his Will, to the Praise of the Glory of
his Grace.</hi> All the most Spiritual, and highest Images of God in his Sons;
all the most beautiful, purest, and sweetest Idea's of Eternity within himself;
Jesus Christ the Supream Image, the Universal Idea, which comprehendeth
them all, and surmounteth them all, give up all their Glories to Love, as
Stars do their light to the Sun. Love is the first, and the last, the most high
Father, and end of all. This is that last opening of the God-Head, in which
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:49838:181"/>
all other lights of Nature, Grace and Glory terminate, as in their proper, and
beatifical end.</p>
            <p>Let us apply this two ways. Let it be a <hi>Caution,</hi> a <hi>quickning</hi> to us.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A Caution.</hi> Take heed of provoking the Love of God to Jealousy.
The greatest Sea rageth with the highest, and most dreadful Waves in a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
when the Wind's upon it. The Jealousy of this Love is the rage or a
God in the greatness of his Power, Glory, and Majesty, at the height of his
God-Head. For this Love is God in the full and final Glory of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
after which we are to expect no other, no further Discovery.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>two things,</hi> of which the love of God is most Jealous, its <hi>Glory,</hi>
and its <hi>Bride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Love is most jealous of its Glory.</hi> The Glory of Divine Love consisteth
in its Purity, its Spirituality, its Heavenliness. It is a pure Spirit, the first and
purest of all Spirits. It is itself the highest Heaven, the Heaven of Heavens.
If you impute to this Love any thing impure, fleshly, or earthly; it you
make this Love, a pretence to the flesh, and to filth, you stain its Glory, you
put it to open shame, you blow up its jealousy to a flame, which will burn to
the nethermost Hell.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Love of God is most jealous of its Bride.</hi> Thy Soul, O Man, is the
Daughter, the Sister, the Bride to this Love. Take heed of dishonouring
the Marriage-bed of Divine Love in thy Soul, and defiling its Spouse. If thou
pollute thy self with any fleshly lust, with any worldly love, with any Idol
without thee, or within thee: this most high, and holy Love will be an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
flame, and a devouring fire burning upon thee, until it have burnt up,
and consumed every Idol of thine Eyes, or Heart, every Lust, every other
Love.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>A quickning.</hi> Direct the Eye of your Spirits thorow all things, thorow
all the Attributes, and Excellencies of God to his Love. Terminate your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
by all Divine Actings, and Discoveries beyond them all upon the Love of
God. For this is the end of all; this is God.</p>
            <p>Divine Love is the great, and rich Diamond of the Divine Nature. All
other operations, and excellencies of the Divine Nature are the Sparklings,
the Lustre, the Water of this Diamond. Let all the Sparklings, and Streams
of sweet light from this precious Stone draw your Eyes, and Hearts to the
Diamond itself, to the naked Bosom of Love. There is the abundance of
Glory. There you shall milk forth the Divine Life, Delights, and Glory in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,</p>
            <p>As the Wood was of old laid upon the Altar, and the Sacrifice upon the
Wood in order to the descent of fire from Heaven, which turning the Wood,
and the Sacrifice into one flame with itself, returned thither from whence it
came: so let your life, and religion be a continual Sacrifice to Eternal Love.
Let the Lord Jesus be thine Altar, which is Love rising up out of the Earth.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:49838:182"/>
Lay all Duties, Graces, Truths, Spiritual Discoveries, as Wood upon this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.
Bring thy Soul, thy Heart, thy whole Person for the Sacrifice. Now wait,
look upward, pray for Love, as the pure flame of the God-Head to come
down, to change all, to unite all unto itself in one Love, and so ascend again
with all unto its own place above the Heavens.</p>
            <p>I have shewed in general, how the Divine Attributes all serve Love, as their
end. I will explain it yet more by three instances of the three chief excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in the Divine Nature. <hi>Wisdom, Power, Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Instance; The Wisdom of God serveth his Love. According to the riches
of his grace, in which he hath abounded towards us in all Wisdom, and Prudence.</hi>
As a plentiful Spring by the abundance of its Waters maketh a bed, and
channel to itself, in which it runs along: so is the Divine Wisdom a manifold,
and deep channel, which the full Spring of free Grace, of Eternal Love ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to itself by the force of its endless streams, as they flow thorow all
things, and play with themselves in various courses, and forms, until they
meet again in the Sea of Love, the Bosom of God. Divine Wisdom is the
richness of Divine Love spreading itself into an infinite variety; sporting it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with itself in all diversity of Forms, and Shapes; thorow innumerable
Changes, innumerable Windings, and Turnings bringing forth itself into a
most ravishing Harmony of all Divine Beauties, and Joys. Divine Wisdom
is Love forming itself into rich designs, most beautiful contrivances, full of
unexpected, and surprizing turns, full of depths past the search of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Eye: that in the close it may display its blessed Treasures more fully;
that it may raise, and enlarge every Spirit to take in its Joys. Thus <hi>the riches
of Grace have abounded towards us in all Wisdom and Prudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Wisdom of God is the Divine art of Love. The Divine Prudence,
and Providence is the Net of Love to catch Hearts, and Souls in, spread tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the Sea of the Creation.</p>
            <p>O blessed Fisher of Souls, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vine Love! O blessed Net of love, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom, and Providence! Thrice-blessed Souls, that are caught in this
Net, by this Fisher! These are taken only to be removed out of the Salt, and
troubled Sea of this World, into the sweet, clear, and calm Sea of Love.</p>
            <p>But wretched are those Spirits, who like Carps in a Pond sink themselves
down deep into the mud of flesh, and fleshly lusts, that they may escape this
Divine net of Love,</p>
            <p>The Wisdom of God is the Musick of Love, by which it charmeth Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
to attract them to itself, to compose them unto a Heavenly Harmony of
Peace, and Purity. Those are indeed Adders, the Seed of the Serpent, who
love not the sound of this Musick, who stop their Ears, that they may not
hear this Charmer the Divine Love, though he charm with so much skill.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Instance. The Power of God serveth his Love, Rom. 1. 16. I am not
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ: for it is the Power of God unto every one that
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:49838:182"/>
believeth.</hi> The Gospel is the Ministry of Grace, or Love. The Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then acting in the Gospel is the Minister, and Servant of Love.</p>
            <p>This will appear more by laying together <hi>three Scriptures</hi> in the <hi>Canticles,</hi>
which opening one another will send forth a sweet light of Divine Grace shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in them.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Scrip. Cant.</hi> 5. 10. It is said of the Lord <hi>Jesus; He is the Chief among
ten thousand.</hi> The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for <hi>Chief</hi> is <hi>Standard-bearer.</hi> I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that we are not to understand here the Person, that beareth the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
or Banner, who ever is inferiour to many Persons in the Army; but the
Prince, whose the Standard, or Banner is, which is carried, unto which all the
Army is gathered together, and under which it moveth. The sense seemeth
to be the same with that; <hi>Joshu. 1. Jesus Christ</hi> appeared in the form of a
man with a drawn Sword in his hand. Being asked by <hi>Joshua,</hi> who he was he
answered: <hi>The Captain of the Lord's Hosts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Scrip. Can.</hi> 6. 10. The Spouse of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is the Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and every believing Soul in particular is described to be; <hi>Terrible, as an
Army with Banners.</hi> This relateth to the <hi>Army,</hi> and <hi>Banners</hi> mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<hi>Cant. 5. 10. Psal.</hi> 34. 7. we read, that <hi>the Angel of the Lord
pitcheth his Camp round about those that fear the Lord.</hi> It is in the Original
Tongue; the Angel <hi>Jehovah.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is God with God the Father above all
Angels, and Men. He is God setting up his Pavilion in the midst of the holy
Angels. He is God setting up his Pavilion with Men in the midst of their
Spirits. This is the Captain of the Lords Hosts, the Prince of Glory, who as
a great Prince at the head of an Army placeth things dearest to him, his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
his Princess in the midst of the Army, as in a place of Strength and
Honour.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Scrip. Cant. 2. 4. The King brought me into his Banquetting House, and
his Banner over me was Love.</hi> You will say now; what hath Love, or a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting
House to do with a Banner of War? You shall now see, how these
Scriptures come home to my end, and declare the <hi>Power</hi> of God to be the
Servant, and the Soldier of his <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proper intent of a Banner is to bear the Cause of the War wrought
upon it, either by Image, or Inscription, or both. It is frequent, when the War
is ended, for the Conquerors in the rooms, in which they feast for joy of the
Victory, to have hanging over their Heads the Banners, under which they are
fought. These are Tropheys, marks of the Victory, and Ornaments of the
Triumph. Silken flags a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> solemn Shows, at publick Feasts, at Funerals are
Imitations, and Images of this.</p>
            <p>If a King make a War for his Bride, or Love, he may very well have Love
in a rich Figure, and in Golden Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> displayed upon his Banners. Neither
can any thing be more pertinent, when he returneth home, and feasteth
publickly with his Queen, than to have these Banners with Love inscribed upon
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:49838:183"/>
them in golden Letters, and figured upon them in glorious Images waving
over their Heads to encrease their Joys by this Declaration; Love was that, for
which the King fought; Love was the force, by which he conquered; Love
is the end of the Victory, the Joy, and Crown of the Feast.</p>
            <p>I know you prevent me in your thoughts, you, who love the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi>
by applying this to your Prince, your Beloved, and his Love, his Bride, your
own Souls.</p>
            <p>I shall bring down all to my purpose, and to your practice in the exercise of
those Principal, and Triumphant Graces, Faith, Love, Heavenly Joy by <hi>three
Conclusions,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Maxims.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Conclu.</hi> All the Armies of God, all the Powers of the God-Head, the
innumerable Companies of holy Angels, and blessed Spirits, all the Hosts of
Heaven, and Earth with their Captain the Lord Jesus at the head of them
move, and fight in their courses under the Banner of Love. Thy Person in a
glorious Image of all Divine Beauties is figured upon the Banner, as this Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Princes Love. Love to thee is wrought upon the Banner in Characters of
Glory. This is the Cause of all motions in Heaven, and Earth. To this Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
all <hi>Powers</hi> every where resort, unto this they are united, under this they

displaid over thee; on every side of thee round about. Every step thou takest
in thy way to Heaven is in the midst of these Warriours. All Divine Powers
continually circle thee in. The Invisible, and Invincible Hosts of God under

and thy Bridegroom, that they <hi>keep thee in all thy ways,</hi> that they <hi>bear thee
in their hands, least at any time thou strike thy foot against a stone;</hi> that thou
never stumble. The Angels of God are thy Chariots of War: thy Chariots
of State, thy Chariots of Love, thy Chariots for Travel, in which thou jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niest
thorow this Wilderness to thy Kingdom, the Kingdom of Love and
Glory. All this they are in one. They make thy way thy Palace in the midst
of thy Kingdom for Strength, for Glory, for Delights, for Rest in thy Love.
They bear thee up above in the light of Life, in the Life of Divine Love.
This is the way high, and lifted up above all the Powers of Darkness, and
Death, in which they carry thee along, that thou mayst never strike thy
foot against any stone of offence, against any hard and hurtful Form of

<hi>the Brightness of the Glory of God,</hi> that is <hi>of Love; the express Image of the
Substance, or Person of God,</hi> that is, of <hi>Love.</hi> For <hi>God is Love. v. 6. 7.
When God bringeth his Son again,</hi> that is, after his Resurrection, in his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and Heavenly Appearance, <hi>into the world; he saith: Let all the Angels of
God worship him. He hath made all his Ministers Spirits, and his Angels a flame
of Fire.</hi> This concerneth thee O Believer, and is spoken of thee.</p>
            <p>O the blessedness of that Soul, which indeed receiveth Jesus Christ, and his
Love by Faith, if only thou didst know thine own happiness! God hath
brought his Son in his second Appearance, in his Spirit, into thine Heart. He
is in thee the brightness of the Glory of Love, that is, of the Divine Nature
shining in the midst of thee. This is that Eternal Sun, from which all blessed
Spirits continually drink in the Light, Influences, Joys of Life, and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.
He is in thee the express Image of Love, which is the Substance, and
Person of God. This setteth itself thorow him, as a Seal upon thine Heart.
Now the Power of God is a Servant to his Love in thee. Now God saith;
Let all the Angels of God worship, how down to, serve my Love in this
Soul. God himself maketh his Angels Flames of Love enfolding thee, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
thy Body, and Spirit, shining within thee, round about thee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the darkest night. He maketh his Angels Ministring Spirits to thee.
Spirits of Glory Minister Love to thee after an Invisible manner in all visible
Things. Every moment of time, every Circumstance, or Accident in time,
are the Wings of Angels, a Chariot of Angels carrying thee above the
snares of Death below into Heaven. This is thy Portion, who believest in
the Lord Jesus and his Love.</p>
            <p>2. See the misery of Unbelievers. How wretched art thou, who believest
not, who sayest to the Love of God, and the Tydings of it from Heaven:
Depart from me, I have no pleasure in you.</p>
            <p>Those Powers of Darkness, that are ever ready to raise up <hi>Leviathan</hi>

burning within thee, burning from without upon thee alwaies, in the midst
of thy Jollities, at thy Feasts, on thy Beds of pleasure. Evil Spirits are ever
Ministring Wrath to thee after an Invisible manner thorow all Visible Things.
Devils are thy Chariots. These wrap thee up in a thick Cloud, in the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

                  </gap>gneth by Righteousness unto Eternal Life thorow Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Grace
is Love in its Fountain, Love upon the Throne. Love is brought in here by
the Apostle under the name of Grace, as a King. Eternal Life, Heaven is the
Kingdom of Love. Jesus Christ is the chief Minister of State to this great
King. God is Love sitting upon the Throne. The Lord Jesus is the same, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Love descending from the Throne to be the Universal Servant, and
General Officer throughout all this Kingdom of Love. Righteousness is the
Scepter of the King. <hi>Thy Scepter is a Scepter of Righteousness, Psal.</hi> 45. Love
<hi>reigneth by Righteousness unto Eternal Life thorow Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are three Ways, in which the Righteousness of God serveth his
Love.</p>
            <p>1. Righteousness is the Royal-Garment, and the Wedding-Garment for
Love itself, and its Bride on the Coronation, and the Wedding day, which are
both one, the day of the Spirit, the day of Grace, the day of Eternity. The
Bridegroom himself is said to be <hi>fairer than the Sons of Men,</hi> in my Text;
<hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 2. He is cloathed with the Righteousness of God, which is the
Comeliness, the Beauty of Holiness, or the Holy, the Pure, the unstained, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt
Beauty of the Divine Nature. Two things make Beauty; Features;
Colours. The Features in the Face of the God-Head are the variety of all
Excellencies in a Harmony. The Colours are the Glory shining in all these.
This is the Righteousness of God. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath both these. He is the
<hi>express Image of the Person</hi> of God. There are the Divine Features. He is
the <hi>brightness of the Glory</hi> of God. There are the Divine Colours, and Lustre.
Both these make up the Garment of Righteousness, which is the Divine Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of Love himself. In this he appeareth fairer, than the Sons of Men on
his Marriage-Day in the day of the Gospel. For Behold! He cometh forth in
the Righteousness of God.</p>
            <p>This also is the Garment, with which Love cloatheth, and adorneth his
Spouse, the Believing Soul to make her fairer, than all the Daughters of Men,
than all the Daughters of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> than all Angelical Beauties. The Queen
is said to be brought to the King, <hi>all Glorious within, in Garments of beaten
Gold, in Garments of Needle-work: Psal.</hi> 4. 5. The Glory quite thorow, the
beaten Gold, the Needle-work is all comprehended in the Righteousness of
God. <hi>He was made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righteousness of God
in him. 2 Cor</hi> 5. 21. This is the Garment, with which Divine Love ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his Queen to make her fit for his Throne, and his Embraces. This Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:49838:184"/>
of Divine Righteousness hath a mysterious vertue in it. It is at once a
Bath of Divine Blood, which taketh off all the blackest, deepest stains of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
from the most loathed Souls. It is a Tincture of Divine Beauty which
giveth in a moment Youth, Immortality, a loveliness quite thorow its whole
Essence, a Substantial, Essential loveliness, a loveliness resembling, and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that of love himself, of God. This is the beaten Gold, all Glory within.</p>
            <p>A learned Interpreter teacheth us, that the <hi>Needle-work</hi> in the Garment sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
properly <hi>Oes</hi> wrought in Gold, like so many Suns, all over the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
How rich, how Beautiful is that Garment of Righteousness, with
which the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> decketh the Soul of every Saint, in which it fully plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Eye of God, and dazleth the Eyes of Angels! It is set all over with
Golden <hi>Oes</hi> of an Eternal Glory, with Invisible, and Eternal Suns, the unvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Face, the entire Person of the Lord Jesus set in every part, and shining
from every point of it. This is the <hi>first Service</hi> of the Divine Righteousness
to the Divine Love, to make itself, and its Bride, the Beloved Soul Infinitely,
Unchangeably Lovely, and Pleasant one to another. This is the <hi>Righteousness</hi>
of our <hi>fustification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Eternal love soweth the Righteousness of God, as a Divine, a Spiritual
Seed in our Hearts. This Seed changeth the ground into its own Nature. It
draweth the vertue and strength of it to itself. It groweth up in it, together
with it to a Tree, which is an entire Paradise in itself. The body of this Tree
is the Lord Jesus in the Power, Glory, Fulness of his Spirit. The Branches
are all the Spirits of God, of Angels, and Saints spread thorow all times, and
things. All moral Excellencies, all the Beauties, and Perfections of the Divine
Image in the first, and universal frame of Nature are the leaves of this Tree,
which here never fade. All Divine Righteousness, all Evangelical Perfections,
and Spiritual Graces are the Fruit, which is fitted for every Season, and ever
ripe in its Season. On this Fruit love itself, which is God, the Son of love <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> all the Angels of love, the Soul herself feed, are refreshed, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to a Divine Joy. This is the <hi>Righteousness</hi> of our <hi>Sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Righteousness of God is the Scepter in the Hand of Love, by which it
ruleth all things.</hi> As <hi>Moses</hi> commanded all the Elements, the Air, the Water,
the Earth by stretching forth the Rod in his hand: so the Love of God sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all things every where by the Scepter of his Righteousness. The Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
and Motions of the Divine Righteousness from the hand of Divine
Love are felt, and obeyed by all things to the utmost end of the Creation.
Righteousness is the Musick of Divine Love, by which all things are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> See the distinction between the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>Spiritual Love,</hi> and the <hi>licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness</hi>
of <hi>Fleshly Lusts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Divine Love is free but Divinely fair, and pure. <hi>St. James</hi> calleth the
Gospel, which is the Ministery of Love from Heaven; the perfect Law of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:49838:185"/>
               <hi>Liberty;</hi> and in another place, the <hi>Royal Law.</hi> Love is free, but it is perfect.
Love is a Liberty: but it is a Law to itself in its Liberty. Love is a King:
but it reigneth in Righteousness. It is itself, both King and Law to itself. <hi>Love,</hi>
saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> is the fulfilling of the whole Law. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> said to <hi>John the
Baptist; It behoveth me to fulfil all Righteousness.</hi> This is the Language of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Love in every Holy Heart: It behoveth me to fulfil all Righteousness.
Love is an obligation of Righteousness to itself. Righteousness is the decency,
the comliness of Love. Love is the Divine Unity, and Righteousness the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Harmony, in which this Unity of Love diffuseth itself thorow all things.
True liberty is only found in Harmony. All Bondage ariseth from Discord,
which hath its Root in Contrariety, and Enmity. Righteousness is the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and Beauty of Love.</p>
            <p>It is the liberty of the Sun to shine; of a Tree to flourish with Leaves,
Flowers, and Fruits. Righteousness is the liberty, the Sun-shine, the Beauty,
and fruitfulness of Divine Love.</p>
            <p>As the Sun by its light: so the love of God by its Spiritual Beauty, which
is Holiness, attracteth Spirits to it; maketh them in love with it; maketh
them lovely by Assimilation, making them like itself; filleth them with all
delights: maketh them fruitful with all Beautiful, and Divine Births of Grace,
and Glory.</p>
            <p>Love and Righteousness are, as the Father and the Son in the Blessed Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Love bringeth forth Righteousness, as its proper brightness, its lovely
light, its essential Image, the express Image of its Substance, and all its Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
or vertues. As the Father is at liberty only in the Son, his own Image;
as the Son is no where at liberty, but in the Bosom of the Father, his own
Principle, and Original: so is love no where truly free, but where it springeth
up, and flourisheth in the Fruits of Righteousness. Righteousness is then only
Free, Kindly, Evangelical, and Divine, when it springeth from the Womb of
love, lyeth in the Bosom of love, hangeth at the Breasts of that love, which is
God; of God, as he is in his own Eternal Form of love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that hath the Son, hath the Father also. He that hath the Father, hath
the Son:</hi> saith St. <hi>John.</hi> Let us not be deceived. He that worketh Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
hath the love of God in him; and he that hath the love of God, hath
also the Righteousness of God. Love is the fulfilling of the Law, of every
Law; Natural, Moral, Evangelical; of the Letter, and of the Spirit. Love
doth nothing uncomely; offendeth no Principle, Humane, or Divine; of
Sense, Reason, or Grace. Thus Divine Love is free, but Divinely fair and pure.</p>
            <p>2. So is not Lust. The Lust of the Flesh is licentious, without Law, Light,
Harmony, Order. All Disorder, Deformity, Shame, Bondage, Anguish, and
Death are there, where Lust is. Can there be any Freedom, Beauty, or Peace
in the midst of Confusion, and Contrarieties?</p>
            <p>Every Lust maketh thy Spirit a narrow, and deep Pit of Darkness, and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:49838:185"/>
Horrour. Thou lyest sunk to the bottom of it in the midst of loathsom
Toads, and poysonous Serpents twining about all thy parts, crawling upon
thy naked Bosom, and naked Heart.</p>
            <p>3. Cast out every flesh Lust. A Lust is the spawn of the Devil. If thou
suffer it to lie in thy Soul, innumerable Devils will spring up out of it, and
make thee a Hell in thy self, a Habitation of Devils. The Devil was a Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
and Blessed Angel, until Lust came. Lust made him a Devil. Lust is the
Nature, and Essence of the Devil: It maketh thee the Child of the Devil.</p>
            <p>4. Take in, cherish the Love of God in thine Heart. Pray for, wait for,
receive gladly the Blessed Sower, the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> when he cometh forth to
sow the Seed of Love in thy Soul. Cherish it, when it is sown. Give it depth
of Earth; let it take root deep enough in thee Suffer no cares of this world to
choak it. Love is the Seed of God in thee: The Image of God with all the
Graces, and Joys of it; the Divine Nature with all its Purities, Powers, and
Perfection; God himself will grow up out of it to dwell and walk in thee;
to fill thee with the presence of his Glory; to make thy Spirit, and Person ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Heaven to him. The God-Head of God; the Guilding, Sweetning, and
warming of Heaven; the life of Eternity is Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have now shewen, how all</hi> the Attributes of God serve his Love, <hi>in</hi> general,
<hi>and in</hi> three particular Instances <hi>of the</hi> Wisdom, Power, Righteousness <hi>of God.
This is the</hi> Second Proof, <hi>that</hi> Love <hi>is the</hi> end <hi>of all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>God resteth in his Love;</hi> This is the <hi>third Proof,</hi> that <hi>Love is the end of
all.</hi> Zephan. 3. 17. <hi>He will rejoyce over thee with singing; he will rest in his
Love.</hi> Like the Joy of Harvest, when the Countryman bringeth in the last
shocks of ripe Corn out of the Field with Songs and Garlands; because this
is the end of all his labours for the whole year: so God rejoyceth, when
his Love is come to the ripe Corn in the Ear, when it is cut off from its Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stalk, when in the full declaration of it, in the riches of its Glory, in the
Simplicity, and Spirituality of its Divine Nature, it is brought home into his
Bosom again, for this is the end of all the Circuit of his labours thorow the
whole Creation. This is his Noah; his rest.</p>
            <p>No man resteth, till he come to his last end. The Love of God is his last
end. For he resteth in his love. All motion tendeth to, and endeth in rest.
All the Motions, Works, and Ways of God tend to, and end in Love. For
this is his rest.</p>
            <p>God in all other Appearances, and Forms of things is <hi>in transitu,</hi> passing
thorow them, as a way-fairing man, till he cometh to the full expression of his
Love. This is his Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> his resting place for ever. Upon this Mount of
Love God casteth off every disguise, layeth aside every vail. Here God is seen
naked, in the simplicity, and brightness of his own Beautiful Person. Love is
the Chrystal Glass of the Divine Essence in its own light, and purity. Here
all the Saints see God, themselves, all things in their Eternal Forms of Divine
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:49838:186"/>
loveliness with a beatifical vision. Here time is no more. The mystery of
God, which is the mystery of Love is made perfect, is finished and ended.</p>
            <p>A wise man, so far as lieth in his Power, maketh all his desires, and designs,
all his works, all things within his Sphear to meet in his end; that his rest in
his end may be sweet and full. God is infinitely Wise, and Almighty. All
his Counsels, and Contrivances; all his Works, and Ways in Heaven above,
on the Earth below; all his Attributes, and Perfections; all things, that ever
were, meet in his Love; as in their end. So he resteth in his Love. His Soul,
and all that is within him is well-pleased in his Love. His Joy is full. He lieth
down upon the Bed of love with the perfection of all contentment; with
the sweetest and highest Complacency of all those infinite Powers in him. Love
is an end every way proportioned to him. For it is himself. God is Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 1. How happy a thing were it, if Men were like to God in this, to have
their rest in love? This would be a Heaven upon Earth. What a Divine Calm
should we be continually in? Divine Love would be a Bed of rest to us, while
the Storms only made Musick to the Heavenly Dances of things round about
us. O the blessed, and unknown force of this Wine of Heaven, Eternal Love,
where it is drunk deeply, down into any Soul by large draughts!</p>
            <p>Beware of the Corruption of Love. The Corruption of the best thing
produceth the worst of all things. Lust is the Corruption of Love. Beware
of the Contrarities to Love. All Passions are Contrarieties to Love. There
can be no Peace, no Rest, no Comfort of Love, while our Lusts, and Passion
prevail. Seek God, seek the Rest, and Joy of the Lord in his Love. <hi>Behol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>

2. <hi>Princ. Every thing which God seeth in himself, he seeth at himself.</hi> All
Forms of things, as they appear in God, appear cloathed with the Form of
God. <hi>James. 1. 5. every good, and perfect Gift cometh from above, from the
Father of Lights, with whom there is no variableness; nor shadow of Turning.</hi> All
appearances of things in the Fahter of Lights, the Sun of Eternity, are Lights;
good, and Perfect Lights, not Beams, but so many entire Suns; Springs, and
Seas of Light, the Light of Life, and Love in the Bosom of that Sun, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them All. For there is no Variableness in God, although there be
Variety. God is the Same in every season, and Appearance without any Shadow
of Turning.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Princ. God, as he seeth all things in himself, in one Divine Form with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
comprehendeth them unchangeably in the closest, and sweetest Embraces, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseth
with them Eternally in the highest degree of all mutual Suitableness,
Sweetness, Satisfaction and Delight. Pythagoras</hi> said; Friendship, the best
Kind of Love on Earth was One Soul in several Bodies, as in so many Images,
and Reflections of itself. Such is God, such is Love, One Incomprehensible
Spirit multiplying itself into Innumerable Representations, and Reflections of
itself; that it may contemplate itself, possess itself, delight it Self Infinitely
for the Divine Form compleat in every One, endlessly for the Variety ever
New.</p>
            <p>This is the sacred, Unsearchable Unity of the Divine Majesty. Thus this
Unity is the most Sacred, and Supreme Love.</p>

               <hi>Quest.</hi> Now you may perhaps say within your selves, some one of you: This
Love, of which you speak, is the Love of God within himself, the Love of God
to himself. What is all this Love to me?</p>

mourning over thee with tears of blood falling from those Wounds which
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:49838:187"/>
Love in him, Sin, and Unbelief in thee have made; with Words of Pity, and
tender Compassions falling from his Lips: O wretched, wretched Soul, which
by sin woundest that Unity of Divine Love, which first sent thee forth from its
Blessed Womb; which by Unbelief continually killest in thy Self that Unity
of the Eternal Spirit, which springeth up in thee, which sendeth forth sweet
glances, maketh strong Impressions of itself upon thee, to draw thee into its
Blessed Bosom. O sinful, O Unbelieving soul, how often within thee, without
thee, in thoughts of thine Heart, in touches upon thy affections, in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery
of my Word, in the works of my Providence have I spread over thee
the Shadowing wings of the Divine Unity, the wings of Divine Love, of the
Heavenly dove, my Spirit? How often would I have gathered thee under these
wings; to have lien safe from every Bird of Prey, every Evil, and Unclean
Spirit; to have lien warm under that Divine Heart, which would have cherished
the Divine Life in thee with all the Graces and Joys of it. But thou wouldest
not Therefore is thy Spirit, and Person left to thee desolate, without Spiritual
Life, Spiritual Comfort, Spiritual Company; which all as Plants of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

Root. But, poor, forlorn Soul, when thou shalt see thy Saviour come again, in
his Spirit, into thy Spirit; then shalt thou fall down at his feet, fly into his
Arms, and say; Blessed is my Jesus coming in the Heavenly Evidence of the
Divine Unity, which is the Supream Love, that subdueth all things to itself.
Now I believe. This Unity, this Love is the Ground and Root of Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 2. All this Love is nothing to thee, who livest in the enmity of the
Serpent. Thou hast no lot, nor portion in that Divine Unity, which is the
Fountain of Love, who livest in Wrath, Malice, and a bitter Zeal. The
Spouse of Christ, the Soul, on which he hath set his Love, is a Dove, hath
Hony and Milk under her Tongue. Divine Love, Heavenly Peace, and Joy
are a Fountain of Milk, and Hony in her Heart. Gentle Language, Words of
Meekness, Healing, Peace-making works are streams of Milk, and Hony under
her Tongue flowing from the Fountain of Divine Love in her heart.</p>
            <p>We read in the Book of <hi>Job;</hi> that the Wicked Man shall <hi>never see the
Land of Brooks, of Fountains, and of Rivers of Waters: but the Serpent shall
bite him;</hi> These expressions seem to allude to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the
fiery Serpents in the Wilderness; which things themselves were Types of the
Paradise of Love in the Divine Unity, and the Enmity of the old Serpent in
the Wilderness of Sin.</p>
            <p>As thou likest not to retain Love in thine Heart, language, and life; but art
a fiery, biting Serpent by deadly hate, bitter Speeches, works of wrath and
malice formed in Hell: so thou shalt never see the pleasant Land flowing with
Brooks, with Fountains, and Rivers of Love. The crooked Serpent shall wrap
thee up in his cursed folds, to draw thee into his hideous Den, there bite, and
devour thee.</p>

            <p>1. Argum. Believe, and by believing thou shalt be transplanted into the
Divine Unity. <hi>He, that is joyned unto the Lord, is One Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Faith, which joyneth us to Christ, by his Approach to us, by our Reception
of him, and Acherence to him, ingrafteth us into the Unity of the Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>The Unity of God is a Golden Chain, which fastned to the Throne of
the Divine Essence above all Heavens, letteth itself down to the lowest parts
of the Earth by several rich, and curious Links, that It may draw us up to
itself. The first and Highest Link of this Golden chain is the Union of the
ever-blessed Persons in the most Holy Trinity in One, Glorious, and Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible
Essence.</p>
            <p>The second Link in this Mystical Chain is the Union of the Divine, and
Humane Nature in One Divine, and Heavenly Person by the Incarnation of
our Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third is the Mysterious Union of Two Persons, a Saint, and his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in One Spirit by Regeneration thorow Faith. While thou believest,
the Divine Unity by these degrees, like the Steps of Gold to Solomon's Throne
of Gold, descendeth into thee, that thou mayst ascend to that by the same
Steps. By believing thou art One with God in the Fountain of the Divine
Nature. The Father himself, the Fountain of <hi>Israel,</hi> is now thy Fountain and
thy Father, Believe, and thou shalt be One with God in his Son, His Image,
His Glory. God giveth His Son for thee, that thou mayst believe. God giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Son to thee in Believing. Believe, and thou shalt be One with God
in his Spirit. <hi>Believing ye received the Spirit of Promise;</hi> saith <hi>St Paul Ephes.</hi> 1.
The Spirit is the Great Promise. The Spirit is All the Promises in a Knot,
living, and flourishing upon the Root of eternity, like the Sun with his
Beams. The Spirit is the Unity Unvailed. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in his Flesh is the Sun
of the Divine Nature, under a Cloud. <hi>Jesus</hi> in his Spirit is the same Sun shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
out clear, and shedding abroad all his Glorious Beams, which are all
the Great, and Precious Promises in their Accomplishment.</p>
            <p>If thou believe, whoever, how vile, how deep in sin, how black soever
thou art with Guilt, thou art now One with God in his Righteousness. <hi>Christ
is made Sin for thee, that thou mayst be made the Righteousness of God in him;
according</hi> to St <hi>Paul.</hi> If thou believest, thou art One with God in his Rest.
<hi>he, that believeth, entreth into Rest, as God also rested: Hebr</hi> 4. 4. Finally believe, and thou shalt be One, as the <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> are One.
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> prayeth not onely for his Apostles; but for all, that shall believe
on him thorow their word. He maketh this Petition expresly for them to
his Father: <hi>That they may be One, as we are One.</hi> John 17. 22. <hi>If two lye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:49838:188"/>
they shall be warm;</hi> saith <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastes.</hi> What warmth of Divine
Life, Love, Joy, and Pleasure is there, where these Three, the Father, Christ
and a Believer ly together wrapt up in One? See how Faith placeth the Soul
in the warm Bosom, upon the Golden Throne of the Divine Unity together
with <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> This Divine Unity in <hi>Christ</hi> is become now thy Center,
and thy Circle, O Believing Soul; thy Center, out of which and in which
thou doest at once both rise, and rest; thy Circle, unto which thou enlargest
thy self, with which thou art encompassed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> Perhaps some souls are so far touched with the Sweet sense of this
Blessed Unity, that they say within themselves; We see indeed a glorious Rest
and Joy, in being implanted into the Unity of the Eternal Spirit by Believing:
But what shall we do that we may believe, and be set in this Root of Eternity?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This Root of Eternity, this Glorious Unity eternally comprehendeth
and holdeth thee. Look then up to this Unity, fix thine Eye unmoveably
upon it, as thy first Principle and Habitation. So wait, until by a Virtue
coming down from thence, thou apprehend by faith this Heavenly Unity of
the Spirit, in which thou art comprehended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. Believe, and thou shalt partake of the Divine Love, by being
planted into this Divine Unity. The Unity, in which the Sons of God dwell
together, as Brethren, is compared by the <hi>Psalmist</hi> to the holy Oyntment
which was poured forth upon the Head of the High Priest, and ran down to
the skirts of his Garment. Thus by Faith the Unity of God in Christ poureth
forth it self as a rich Oyntment of Divine Love, which spreadeth itself in
its precious Substance and Sweetness over thy whole Person to the lowest bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of thy Garment. Thus art thou anointed to be a King and Priest to God
the Father together with the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> When this Unity openeth itself upon
thee to the Eye of thy Faith, and taketh thee into itself; then shalt thou see thy
self, and be ravished to see thy self in the midst of all the Loves of God and
embraced most closely by them all.</p>
            <p>1. In this Unity the Eye of Faith discovereth to thee <hi>Electing</hi> Love, Now
thou rellisheth the Sweetness, now thou receivest upon thy Spirit the Seal of
Electing Love, which was before the World was, and then had thee with it
in its Bosom. Now thou seest by the Light of the Glory of this Unity shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon the Eye of thy Faith the Father in the Height of Eternity looking
upon thee in One Loveliness, loving thee with One Love together with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Beautiful, and Blessed Person of his Son.</p>
            <p>2. Faith sheweth the <hi>Justifying Love</hi> in this Unity. What peace, what Joy
is there in this Sight, when a poor Believer taken out of the Dungeon where
he lay in chains of guilt, and filth, a Prisoner to the Wrath of God, seeth
himself set in the Court of the great King before his Throne, acceptable, and
amiable in the Beloved One? Thou now appearest washed in the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Blood of God. Thou shinest in the same Beauty, and Righteousness of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:49838:188"/>
God together with <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> Yea, he is thy Loveliness, who is Height
and Sealed Sum of all Loveliness; of all Loves. For <hi>thou art made accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
in the Beloved One; Eph. 1. v.</hi> Thou art not only Righteous, but
Righteousness itself; the Righteousness of God. Thy Person is a Solid Glory, a
Transparent Glory, a Pure, unmixt Glory of Divine Righteousness. For thou
art the <hi>Righteousness of God in him.</hi> Faith maketh thee <hi>One Spirit</hi> with him,
who is the <hi>Brightness of the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Believing thou meetest in this Unity with the <hi>Sanctifying Love</hi> of God.
That Seed of God, which is One, soweth itself in thy Soul, and springeth up
into the Fruits of Holiness, and Immortality. Now say to thy Soul upon a
good account: Return unto thy Rest, O my Soul. The Lord hath dealt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
with thee. The Goods of Heaven, and Eternity are sure to thee. For
this Seed of All Good, of Grace, and Glory, which is now sown in thee, will
grow up by day, or by night, whether thou sleep, or wake; though thou know
not, how it grow.</p>
            <p>4. The Believing Soul seeth, and smelleth the Heavenly Flower of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
Love</hi> living, and flourishing in this Root of Eternity, the Divine Unity.
The Spirit himself, whose Unity is the Band of all Peace, and Joys, is now
<hi>with thee,</hi> and <hi>in thee,</hi> a Comforter, the Fountain of all Living Comforts.</p>
            <p>5. Believe, and Faith will set in thine Eye this Glorious Unity, as the
Crown of <hi>Glorifying Love. Jesus Christ</hi> saith expresly among his last Words,
<hi>John. 17. 22. That Glory, which thou hast given to me, I have given to them:
that they may be One, as we are One.</hi> This is the concluding, and crowning
Glory; This is the Glorifying Love, Love in Glory; the <hi>Unity</hi> made Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
The Father hath given Glory to <hi>Christ</hi> by giving him the Being of his
heavenly Person, which is the Glory, and himself in that Being a Glory, in that
Glory. <hi>Jesus</hi> giveth the same Glory to us, himself, and his Father, to make us
One Glory with themselves; that the Unity may be the Glory, and each in
the same Spirit may be a Unity of Glories. O! believe. Can any thing be desired

               </gap>rer, greater by any Soul, than to be one Love, one Glory with
<hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and his Father? Faith planteth thee into this Love, into this Unity.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Argum.</hi> Faith by planting thee into the Unity of God bringeth thee
into the Light of God. The Eye of Faith seeth the Truth of Things, as it is
in <hi>Jesus,</hi> and <hi>Jesus,</hi> as He is in the Unity of the Spirit. <hi>Ephes. 4. 21. If
ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> have been taught in Him, as the Truth is in Christ. Ephes. 4. 3, 4, 5. Keep
the Unity of the Spirit in the Band of Peace; One Body; One Spirit, One Lord.</hi>
The Light of Faith, is the Light of the Divine Unity; as the Light of Sense
is the Brightness, and Glory of the Corporeal Unity, which is One Sun. This
Light discovereth the Truth of things in the Secret of the most sacred Unity,
in the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> as He is One in the Unity of the Spirit. How different
is the Appearance of things to Sense, and to Faith? What different Lights shine
in the Diversity of flesh, and in the Unity of the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rit? In the latter of these
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:49838:189"/>
are seen all beautiful, and pleasant things, all things in Beauty, Pleasantness, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
Immortal Forms. And this Sight alone is the Truth. Believe, so shalt thou
see thy self in <hi>Christ</hi> in One Glory. Thou shalt know, that this which thou
now seest is the Truth, thy True Person, and Form. Now thou shalt cry out
with Joy, and Wonder. <hi>Behold I am fair, I am altogether fair. It is easie

the Unity of the Spirit.</hi> Believe; So shalt thou see all the Saints in One Glory
with <hi>Christ,</hi> and shalt know, that this is the Truth of every Saint. Then shalt
thou stretch forth thine arms to them, and say; <hi>How is my heart enlarged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you! Ye are, as I am, all look like Princes, the Sons of the great King. My joy
is fulfilled in You all.</hi> Believe: For, when thou behevest, thou shalt see all
the Works of God in a Vision of Truth and Glory. Thou shalt see them in
<hi>Christ,</hi> as Christ is One in the Unity of the Spirit. All shall appear to thee

Unity, with that Glorious Unity itself set in them to enrich them.</p>
            <p>Believe. O what a Paradise in the third Heavens is a Believer caught up
into, when first the Eye of Faith is opened in him? Yea, as often, as it openeth
itself in him; He beholdeth all Forms of Things, as they are in Truth, this
Truth, as it is in <hi>Christ,</hi> this <hi>Christ,</hi> as he is in the Unity of the Spirit. With
what pleasure like that of a Resurrection from the Dead, when all things, that
ever we conversed with, rise together with us into the same Glory, doth a man
now look round about him, and say. <hi>O all ye Appearances of Things, that
ever were, or are to be! Are these your Forms, your true Forms? Is this sight of
you, which I have now in the Divine Unity, the only Truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the Believing Soul stretcheth forth her hands to them all, and cryeth
out with wonder, and delight: my Father, my Mother, my Husband, my
Wife, my Brethren, my Sisters, my Children, all the delights of my Eyes;
all the Sweetness, and Joy of all Relations are ye all.</p>

Fruits of this blessed Root in <hi>Purity</hi> and Love.</p>
            <p>3. Let a Divine Purity shine in thy Life, O Christian. The Unity of
God is his Simplicity. The Simplicity of God is his Purity. The Purity of
the most excellent things is their freedom from mixture. The more they are
themselves, the more they shine, the more pure, and precious they are.</p>

and all things; converse with all, as they appear, as thou meetest them in thy
walks in this circle of the Divine Unity. Sleep not the sleep of Sense, or
Flesh, lest thou be hurried in Dreams into the Land of Darkness, where the
Light is Darkness, where there is no Order, no Unity.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> Here an Objection cometh in our way, which may arise in every
understanding against all this discourse, which we have had concerning the
Divine Unity, and Divine Love. Doth not God see Sin, and hate Sinners?
Ought not we to do so?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer affirmatively; the Divine Nature both in God, and in the
Children of God discovereth the deformity of Sin by a most clear Light;
and hateth it with a most perfect hatred.</p>
            <p>I shall confirm, and explain this <hi>Answer</hi> by <hi>four particular Answers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Ans.</hi> S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n is a privation of Holiness, which is the Beauty of Spirits, as
Darkness is a privation of Light; and every Evil of some Good. Privations
are known only by their contrary habits God, and all Holy Spirits see the
Evil and Ugliness of Sin in the Light, and Glass of their own Heavenly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Ans.</hi> Hatred is an intellectual contrariety. The Unity and Love of the
Divine Nature, in the King of Saints, and all his Holy Ones is essentially and
formally in itself an irreconcilable opposition, an active contrariety to Enmity,
and Sin, as Light, Day, and Immortality are to Darkness, Night, and Death.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Ans.</hi> God seeth Sin in order to his Wrath. God seeth his Wrath in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to his Glory; his Glory as the full object of his Love, order is the Chain,
and Band of Unity. Thus God beholdeth all at once, as they lie comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Unity of Eternal Light, and Love by their several Subordinations.</p>
            <p>God beholdeth Sin, as it is swallowed up into a flame of wrath; the flame of
wrath, as it is heightned to a Light of Glory; the Light of Glory, as it shineth,
and liveth in the Eye of his Love, the Fountain of all Lights, Life, and Joys.</p>
            <p>Love is the Eternal, and rich Root of all. Glory is the Tree, that springeth
up out of this Root, the perfect, and full Image of Love, in which it liveth,
diffuseth, and delighteth itself within itself.</p>
            <p>This Tree of Glory spreadeth itself into many flourishing Branches, among
which are Holiness, Justice, Wrath against Sin. Wrath by the force of the
contrariety raiseth up Sin, as a mark to shoot its burning Arrows, and cast his
fiery Darts at. Love thorow these Attributes letteth in Sin by the Law, that
it may display itself more fully in its War with its Enemy, in it Conquest,
and Triumph over it; that it may break forth, and rise up thorow it more
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:49838:190"/>
powerfully, purely, and sweetly; like a flame going up to Heaven from
a great pile of Wood perfectly subdued to it.</p>
            <p>The Unity of God is now the Glass of Love, in which alone God seeth al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Operative, or Permissive Providences.</p>
            <p>Sin appeareth to him in the Glass of his Wrath and Justice. These shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Glory. His Glory shineth forth from the Arms, and Bosom of his Love, which
is the inmost Center, and outmost Circle of the Divine Unity. Here all
things lie, here all things present themselves to God, as Mysteries of Divinity,
and Love in the Unity of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>God beholdeth with a fulness of Joy his Love the reflection of himself,
his own Fountain, the Fountain of his blessed Unity, in which he lyeth Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
bathing himself in pure floods of Incomprehensible Pleasures; this
Love, this Unity, this Fountain he beholdeth in all his Glory. His Glory is the
Object of his Eye in the Severity of his Justice, and Wrath. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templateth
his Justice, and Wrath alone in Sin. Thus God seeth every
where the Mystery of his Divine Unity, as the great and bright deep
of Eternity. He seeth every where the Seal, the express Image of his Divine
Unity, where all the riches of his Glory, and Sweetnesses of his Love unfold
themselves, and sport together.</p>
            <p>Thus, O Saint, learn to look upon every Sin. See it in this Glass of Truth,
the mystery of the Divine Unity. See this secret and invisible Jewel, the
mystery of the Divine Unity sealed upon it, sealed up in it. Thus shalt thou
see Sin so, as to preserve thy Purity, and thy Love both in one. Thou shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
see Sin so, as to be at once a flame of Wrath to it, and a Light of Glory, a
flame of Love in that flame of Wrath, comprehending both, Wrath and Sin
in the Wrath. So shalt thou see Sin, hate, and dwell for ever with God, who
is the Beauty of Holiness, and Love.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Ans.</hi> God looketh upon a Sinner, as upon a Prison and a Grave, where
the Truth, the Divine Seed, the Light and Life of the Divine Image lyeth
detained, captivated, slain by a Lie; the Prince of Life, and Light by the
Powers of Darkness. His Wrath and Hatred against the Sinner is a zeal of
Love. He cometh forth with Thunders, Lightnings, Tempests and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes
in his Wrath to break down the Prison walls, to break open the Grave,
that the Prince of Glory may come forth into the Light of Life, and the
liberty of the Glory of a Son of God.</p>
            <p>God, as a Sun, breaketh forth with power, and in his Strength, to dissolve
by the force of his Beams the Inchantment, and Light; that the Sons of
Light, and the Truth may be set free.</p>
            <p>Thus God hateth Sinners; thus do thou hate them with a perfect Hatred.
Let thy fire be no bitter zeal, but a zeal of Love. Let thy woundings be
Divine Anointings.</p>

I have hitherto passed thorow only one half of my discourse upon the
description of Spiritual Love by the supream Unity in the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>I shall take my ground for the other half; <hi>Galat.</hi> 3. 20. This shall be my
Center for a time, from which my Motions shall arise, and whither they shall
return to end thee.</p>
            <p>The words are these: <hi>Now a Mediatour is not of one; but God is one.</hi>
This Scripture hath a sweet, and clear depth of Love in it, but unfathomable.
This depth is the Unity of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>St. Paul</hi> stateth here the most essential difference between the Law, the
Ministery of Wrath; and the Gospel the Ministery of Love. One is <hi>establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the hands of a Mediatour;</hi> in the other God is one. The Love-union in
the Gospel is too near, too sure, too sweet to need, or admit a Mediator.</p>
            <p>The Fountain of all Evangelical Grace, and Love is the Unity of God.
<hi>The Unity of the Spirit is the Band of Peace</hi> between the Uncreated, and all
Created Spirits, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            <p>But we shall more clearly see the Riches Treasured up in this <hi>Scripture,</hi> if
we look upon it by the light of another <hi>Scripture</hi> in the same Chapter; <hi>v. 16.
Now the Promise was made to Abraham, and his Seed, he saith not to Seeds, as
to many, but as to one. And to thy Seed, which is Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Holy <hi>Apostle</hi> in this <hi>Chapter</hi> maketh it his work to prove, that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
is not by the works of the Law; but by Faith in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Gospel.</p>
            <p>God descending into Christ, and taking up Christ into himself; <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
in this fulness, and Glory of the God-Head entring into the Soul, and taking
the Soul into himself, by the free Revelation, and immediate Union of Faith:
This is the Righteousness of God, and of his Saints in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>One Argument, by which St. <hi>Paul</hi> maintaineth Righteousness to be of
Grace, and not by Works is laid down. <hi>v.</hi> 15. the Covenant of Grace was
long before the Law. He confirmeth that here <hi>v. 16. The Promises were made
to Abraham, and to his Seed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in this verse established the Heavenly Building of the
Gospel upon three beautiful, and firm Pillars.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Pillar;</hi> The Gospel is a meer, simple, pure Promise. That, which was
called in the verse before, the <hi>Testament,</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> is here expressed by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</hi>
The Law is compounded of <hi>Precepts,</hi> and Promises dependant upon
those Precepts, as condition of the Covenant to be performed mutually on
both sides; of prohibitions and threatnings annexed. But, as the Sun is a
Body streaming forth freely by a knot of Beams. So is the Gospel a knot of
Promises, which are all Love in so many clear, unmixt Beams shooting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
freely forth from the fulness, and force of Love alone in its Head-spring,
the heart of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will say; Are there not Precepts set down; Conditions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:49838:191"/>
Duties required; high, and hard things to be performed in an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
State?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is most true. The Gospel hath its Precepts, Conditions, Duties;
and these all high, hard, raised to a pitch of Spirituality, and Heavenliness
beyond the reach and sight of any natural Spirit. But these all depend upon
the Promise, and not the Promise on them. All Evangelical Graces, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are Children of the Promise. The Promise is, as the <hi>Hierusalem</hi> above,
free, the mother of all living Principles, and Performances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We read;</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>That</hi> we have given to us, great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
by which we are made partakers of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>You, who believe not, hear, and believe. You who believe but faintly,
and weakly; hear, that your Faith may be encreased. You, who are strong in
Faith; hear, and believe yet more. Hear, how all the difficulties in believing
in the whole life of Faith from the Beginning to the end; the Promises are
Pipes of pure Gold laid into your Hearts from the Heart of Christ in Glory.
By these from that flourishing Olive Tree, the Divine Nature, as the best Oil,
floweth in upon you freely, and perpetually.</p>
            <p>When a Gardiner would set choice Plants, Flowers in a barren, sandy Soil,
he first bringeth in fresh, and fertile Soil to lay upon it. Then he planteth in this
good ground, which he hath made, his Flowers, and Trees, which now flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and make that barren Earth a rich, and pleasant Garden. So God findeth
thy Spirit, O Man, barren, and sandy, a Rock. No Spiritual Plant, no Truth,
or Grace of the Gospel can take root, or live here. But be not thou discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by all this, by the hardness of thine Heart, the barrenness, and enmity of
thy Spirit to the Heavenly Seed, which it killeth, as often, as it is sown in it.
Look to the Promises, God by these will bring in the Divine Nature. With
this, as a good, and Heavenly ground he will overlay, and enrich thy Spirit.
Now God will plant every pleasant Truth, every Evangelical Grace in thy
Spirit. Now they shall all prosper, they shall unfold their several Beauties, send
forth their sweet smell, and bring forth much fruit in thee. For this new
Earth of the Divine Nature shall send forth its Fatness and Sweetness into
them, and make them to grow.</p>
            <p>When a Prince goeth his progress, his Gests are set down before he leaveth
his Court; which way, and how far he shall Travel every day; where he shall
lodge at night. His Servants with Furniture, and Provisions from his Court
wait upon him all along.</p>
            <p>A Promise is a Declaration, and Obligation of Divine Love, which it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of itself, which it layeth upon itself, free, and immutable.</p>
            <p>Whoever thou art, that hearest this, believe in the Promise: Believe freely,
in a free Promise. This Faith will make thee the Prince, of which I speak.
Thou art now a Prince come forth from Heaven to take thy Progress thorow
this world, and so return home to Heaven again. All thy Gests by day, and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:49838:191"/>
Rests by night are set down Eternally in Heaven in the Book of Love there,
which is the Heart of God, and from thence in a Promise, which is Eternal
Love, or the Heart of God transcribed, to be read by thee. The day of a
Saint is the Light shining from the Face of God. The night is the drawing
in, and darkning of this Light. All thy motions by day with every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
O Believer, O Heavenly Prince, are described exactly in the draught
of Divine Love, the Promise. Thou goest, as it is written of thee there.</p>
            <p>The Holy Angels, thine own Servants from thy Court in Heaven attend
thee in all thy way with Heavenly Provisions, and Minister unto thee, as is
appointed there. Thy resting-place every Night is ordered in the Promise.
The Blessed Angels go before thee. They take up thy lodging for thee. They
make it ready with Heavenly Furniture. They make thy Bed for thee. They
are a Guard round about thee for the fear of the night. All things are done,
as was set down before in the Bosom of Eternal Love opened in the Promise.
Thus the Gospel is All a Promise. The Promises are Love shining forth by
its own Brightnesses, and Beams. Love is that name of God, which is an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
poured forth. Love is the Divine Nature freely flowing, and diffusing
itself, like Live-Honey. As a Bottom of Silk is unwound, and wrought out
into divers beautiful Figures in a Garment of Needle-work: such is thy
Life, thy whole Story, O Saint, Divine Love spun forth from the glorious
Heart of God, as Silk from the curious Worm, is wound up into a Bottom in
the Promise. This rich Bottom worketh out itself into all thy motions, and
rests, into all thy Changes, and Chances thorow thy whole course, as into so
many exact, and shining Figures of Eternal Glories. Thus Love maketh it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the entire History of thy Life; of that History, and Life it maketh for
thee a Garment to wear in Heaven, becoming the Bride of the great King.</p>
            <p>You may see something by my description of this first Pillar, on which the
Gospel standeth, how God is one in the Covenant of Grace, and that high,
Heavenly Unity the sweet Spring of all the Grace, and love of the Covenant.
You will see this breaking forth more, like the day dawning by degrees upon
you, as I shall set before you the other two Pillars of Evangelical Truth.</p>
            <p>2. Pillar. The Promise of the Gospel is to the Seed, and to that Seed, as to
One. To <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his Seed were the Promises made. He saith not, to
Seeds, as to many; but to his Seed, as to One. v. 16.</p>
            <p>The Seal of the Promise upon the Seed is the Unity. God will not give
his Glory to another. The Love, and Grace of God in the Gospel is his
chief Glory. Therefore is Evangelical Love to the Evangelical Seed; and
that for the Unity sake. The Seed every where in the Father, in all the Off-spring
is one with itself. Love, and Unity are ever inseparable. The Strength
and Sweetness of the Relation between the Father, and the Child is the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Love is at its height in a Father, because there is the Head of the Unity.
The Unity here is the Spring of Love. From hence its streams run along into
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:49838:192"/>
all relations with the sweeter; and stronger force, as they are nearer to this
Spring. <hi>God is Love. God is one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Pillar. That one Seed, to which the Promises are made, is Christ. To</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<hi>and to his Seed: as to One; and that one, Christ. Isaac</hi> was the Seed of
<hi>Abraham. Isaac</hi> stood only, as a Figure of the Lord <hi>Jesus. Isaac</hi> signifieth
<hi>Laughter.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is the true Seed of Mirth and Joy. When he
cometh to us by his Spirit, which is his proper, his eternal Presence, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance;
he bringe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h back our Captivity from the Powers of Sin, Sorrow,
and Death; he filleth our Mouths with laughter; he maketh us, as those that
Dream; he placeth us in the midst of such glorious Persons, and Things, he
cloatheth our Persons with so much Glory; and all this by so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asy, so sweet, so
sudden, so universal, so unexpected a change; that it seemeth for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Glory more like a Dream, than Truth.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>Isaac</hi> here typifie the Son of God; then doth <hi>Abraham</hi> stand in the
place of God the Father. The name signifieth <hi>The high Father of a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;</hi>
or, <hi>The Father of a high Multitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God the Father maketh the Promises to himself, and to his Son <hi>Christ. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ</hi> is the Seed, to which the Promises are made, and the Promised Seed,
the Pearl in the Casket of every Promise. Thus God is one in the Gospel;
the Gracious Maker of the Promise; the Rich Matter of the Promise; the
Glorious Heir of the Promise. This Unity is the Love of the Gospel, in
which the Seed is one in the Father, in Christ, in all the Saints; and this one
Seed is the Lover, the Love, and the Beloved.</p>
            <p>God loveth himself in his Son; his Son in his Saints. God, Christ, and the
Saints lie all wrapt up in one Seed. This is the Unity; and this Unity the
Love of the Gospel. One Seed shining out, and springing up thorow all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Fellowship of all Beauties, and delights with itself, within itself.</p>
            <p>We have set up some Lights in this verse to shew the Glories of Divine
Love the more advantageously, as they are presented to us. <hi>v.</hi> 20. in those
words; <hi>God is One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us draw nearer to the verse itself, the Center of our discourse.</p>
            <p>St <hi>Paul</hi> raiseth an <hi>Objection,</hi> and answereth it. <hi>v.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> This is the <hi>Objection:</hi> If the Gospel were before the Law of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Force, the only dispensation of Love, Life, and Righteousness: why then
was the Law added.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> answereth this <hi>Objection,</hi> by <hi>Defining,</hi> and <hi>Confining</hi> the <hi>Use,</hi>
and <hi>Times</hi> of the Law.</p>
            <p>1. St <hi>Paul</hi> defineth the end, &amp; <hi>Use</hi> of the Law. <hi>The Law was added because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Transgression.</hi> There was a fourfold use of the Law, until <hi>Christ</hi> came; to <hi>discover,</hi>
to <hi>restrain,</hi> to <hi>heighten Sin,</hi> to <hi>bring Condemnation,</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> upon <hi>Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The</hi> Times <hi>of the Law are</hi> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nfined <hi>to the coming of</hi> Christ: Until th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Seed should come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:49838:192"/>
Then the <hi>Holy Apostle</hi> giveth us <hi>two Arguments</hi> to make it plain, that the
Law can be no more of force, or have any place, when <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.
These <hi>two Arguments</hi> are taken from <hi>two Essential differences</hi> between
the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Argum. The Law was ordained by Angels.</hi> God appeared not under
the Law in his own Person, nor in that sweet, and supream brightness, which
floweth immediately from his Face. He cloathed himself with the created
Light of the Angelical Nature, and Glory, as with a Garment. In the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Angels, and their Beauties, as under a vail, he was seen, and conversed
with Man. But when the Seed cometh, which is <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> this is God in
Person, God in his own Essential Form, and Image.</p>
            <p>Now the Scene, the Appearance is changed from the diversities of Angels,
and their Glories to the Divine Unity. Now the Angels, thorow which, as
multitudes of little Stars in the night, the Light of the God-Head scattered
faint glimmerings of itself, vanished out of sight. They resigned their weak
Beams, Beauties, and Beings to one Sun, that one Seed their Fountain, the
Unity of God in Christ. Here they are New-born, they are made perfect, they
shine again in one Glory. The Son of Man cometh now in the Glory of his
Father, in his own Glory, in the Glory of all his Angels. When Christ is
seen in his Heavenly shape, which alone is the Light of the Gospel, Angels
appear no more singly, all Glories are seen united in their Center, the Person
of God in Christ. Now hear, O <hi>Israel;</hi> come forth; and O ye Daughters of
<hi>Sion;</hi> the Lord your God, your Jesus is one. This is the <hi>first Argument,</hi> and
the first essential difference between the Law, and the Gospel.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Argum.</hi> The Law was ordained by Angels; <hi>in the hand of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
Now a Mediator is not of One; but God is One. v.</hi> 19. 20. Thus we are
come home to the verse itself, where you shall see all this discourse come home
to our mark, at which we aim; the Fountain of all Evangelical Graces, and
Loves in the Unity of God.</p>
            <p>We shall best understand these words by a distinction of Mediators.</p>
            <p>There is a Mediator of Distance, and of Unity. This latter the Mediator
of Unity is one with both the Parties, between which he mediateth, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
them both, maketh both one in himself. Such a Mediator <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
is in the Gospel. Such a Mediator the Law hath not; this place intendeth not.
This hath some shadow of itself in the <hi>Medium Participationis,</hi> which Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
treateth of.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Mediator of Distance</hi> is one, who standeth between two to keep them
apart, because they cannot approach one to the other. This is here meant.
The People of <hi>Israel</hi> said to <hi>Moses; Let God speak to thee, and we will hear
thee. But let not God speak to us any more, least we die.</hi> God approved of their
words: <hi>They have said well.</hi> Thus the Law was ordained in the hand of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
as a Mediator. This we may express by the <hi>Medium Abnegationis;</hi> a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
of Distance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:49838:193"/>
When the Seed cometh, this Mediation, this Administration, the Distance, and
so the Law ceaseth. Now <hi>God is One. Christ is</hi> the <hi>Seed, Christ</hi> is come
<hi>Christ</hi> hath <hi>two Natures</hi> in him, but he is One Person in both Natures, and
that One Person, the One only God. God is the Person, the Subsistency, the
Root, out of which the whole Tree with all its Arms and Branches of both
Natures, Humane, and Divine springeth; in which it subsisteth; from which
all operations, and fruits proceed; to which all denominations belong, which
is the name to be named in all, and to which every name belongeth. This is
Christ. The one Seed, the one Spirit in all the Saints, in all the Graces, and
Comforts of the Gospel is this <hi>Christ,</hi> that one Person, which is the only true
God. Thus God is one in all.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in his Heavenly Spirit, and Body is the Glorious Circle of
the Divine Unity, in which God, Christ, and all the Elect, Saints, or Angels li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
so close, so enfolded, and wrapt up mutually one in another; that no Mediator
can come between them; that they need no Mediator; save as this Unity itself,
the <hi>one Seed</hi> is the Mediator.</p>
            <p>There are two Promises made to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning his Seed; one, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
they shall be, as the Stars of Heaven for number; the other, that they shal
be, as the Dust of the Earth for Multitude.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seed</hi> is <hi>Christ.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus one Seed</hi> in all the uncreated Glories,
which are fixed, as innumerable Stars in the Heaven of the Divine Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

to the Fountain of Love. Love is made sure, and tyed fast from the Thron
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:49838:193"/>
of Love in Heaven to the Hearts of Believers on Earth by a three-fold Cord.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Cord.</hi> The <hi>first Cord</hi> is the <hi>Promise.</hi> By the immutable tie of a Promise
in which it is impossible for God to lie, hath he assured, and secured his Love
to thee. The two chief Attributes of God, on which all the rest wait, in
which they are comprehended are <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> Both these must fade,
and pass away, before one tittle of the Promise can fail of its accomplishment.
For <hi>Goodness</hi> maketh the Promise: but <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> both are obliged
to the keeping of it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Cord. The second Cord is Grace. The Promise is of Grace, that it may be
sure.</hi> You, who are apt to despair of Love, and Blessedness let down from
Heaven into your Souls by the Golden Line of a Promise, because your hearts
are unfit Mansions to entertain such Heavenly Guests, hear, and consider this:
As the Beams of the Sun descend upon the Earth, infuse a precious vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, quicken, and call up the vertue, and Seeds of the Sun there, make it
green flourishing, and fruitful; yet lean not, depend not at all upon the Earth;
but have their root in the Bosom of the Sun above, from which they shoot
themselves down into the lap of the Earth: so the Promises of the Gospel, as
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ams of Eternal Love, are fixed in the Sun of the Divine Nature, as their
Heavenly root. From that they are bred, by that they are nourished, and
maintained. This S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n poureth them down upon thee to enlighten, enliven,
and transform thy earthly, carnal heart into a Spiritual, and Heavenly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
But these Beams, that come to warm, and beautify thee, lean not at all
upon any thing in thee. They depend singly, and entirely upon their proper
Sun, which is Love, the heart of God.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Cord.</hi> The <hi>third Cord</hi> is the <hi>Seed. That the Promise may be sure to the
Seed.</hi> Lawyers say, that no gift by any deed is good without a consideration:
They say also, that there is no consideration, which bindeth more, than
that of Fatherly affection; when a deed runneth in those words: <hi>I out of my
Fatherly affection give to my Son, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the consideration in the New Testament the Love of a Father. All
the Promises of Grace, and Glory, of Heaven, and Earth, Time, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
are made to the <hi>Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ground of a Fathers Love is the Unity. A Father loveth himself in
his Seed. His Seed is one with himself. The Seed lay first in the Father. It
cometh forth from the Father. It is one Nature with the Father, and beareth
the Image of the Father before him. The same Seed in the Father is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Son in the Son. All Relations, the Loves, and Sweetnesses of all
Relations are Unions, that is, Participations, and branches of Unity. Paterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Relations, and Love of a Father is Unity, the Root, and Head of all
Unions, Relations, and Loves.</p>
            <p>The Philosopher teacheth us, that the reason of a Fathers Love to his
Children is <hi>Self-love,</hi> and the Love of Immortality. He seeth <hi>himself</hi> ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:49838:194"/>
and flourishing, propagated to Immortality in his Off-spring. All num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are said to be the first Unity multiplied. Each number springeth from
Unity, is made up of Unities, consisteth in an Unity. Thus God is one in his
Seed. The Seed is the Unity of God multiplying itself into many Self-Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the same Divine Nature, in the same Essential, and Eternal Image, the
Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> Is not the Promise now sure, when it is to the Seed, in which the
Unity of God, the Love-spring of Eternity, is the Band of Love?</p>
            <p>I have not yet sounded the Sea of Sweetness opening itself to us in this
Scripture: <hi>Now a Mediator is between Two: but God is One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is said to have created all things by <hi>Jesus Christ; Ephes. 1. 9. To have
made all things by him, and in him, Colos.</hi> 1. 16. God then is <hi>One</hi> in Nature,
and in Grace, in the new Creature, and in the first Creation. There is <hi>one Seed</hi>
of both, the Lord <hi>Jesus. All things were made by him, and without him was
nothing made, that was made, John</hi> 1. 2. As no Wheat springeth without a
grain of Wheat cast into the ground, as no Rose groweth without the Seed
of a Rose: so no Flower of Divinity, no Divine Work, no Divine Image
cometh forth any where, in this World, or that which is to come without the
Divine Word, the Seed of God, which was in the Beginning with God, and
was God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acts 17. 24. St. Paul</hi> maketh this his great Argument to convince the
<hi>Athenians,</hi> and to persuade them to Faith in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the <hi>Unity</hi> of the
<hi>Divine Seed. They feel after him,</hi> saith he, <hi>if so be they may find him; although
he be not far from every one of us. In him we live, and move, and have our
Being;</hi> as in our proper Seed and Element. <hi>For as one of your own Poets hath
said: We also are his Off-spring.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> in the Authority, and with the
Seal of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> confirmeth the Testimony of Nature to this Truth;
the <hi>Unity of the Divine Seed</hi> in <hi>Nature. God is One</hi> not in <hi>Regeneration</hi> only,
but in the <hi>Creation</hi> also. <hi>We also are his Off-spring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou, who art hitherto Earthly, and Natural, an outcast of Nature, cast
down to the nethermost parts of the Earth in Lusts, Unbelief, Blindness of
Mind, Hardness of Heart, Profaneness, Enmity, seek thou also after God, feel
after him. Thou also mayest see him, and feel, and find him in every motion,
in every act, and part of thy Life, in every point of thy whole Being. Every
Motion, Act, and Part of thy Life, every Point in thy whole Being is that
Field, in which is hid the Treasure of the Divine Being, Beauty, and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<hi>Thou livest, and movest, and hast thy Being in him</hi> He liveth, and moveth
and hath his Being in thee. He is thy <hi>Seed</hi> in thee. <hi>For thou also art his Off-spring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Believe the Love of God, open all the parts of thy Being, and Powers of
thy Soul to take in this Love. Thou hast in thee the band of the Love-union,
the Divine Love-spring, the Unity of the Divine Seed. For thou also
art his Off-spring.</p>
            <p>Blessed is he, who believes, and seeks for this Pearl more than Silve and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:49838:194"/>
diggeth for it more, than for hidden Treasures. Blessed is he, who findeth it,
and goeth, and selleth all that he hath to purchase it. Thou hast this Pearl in
thine own Field, the Divine Seed in thine own Soul, and Being.</p>
            <p>Let this be the only Seed in thy Soul. Then hast thou sold all for it. Then
will it spring up into a living Palace of one Immortal Pearl in thee, which
God himself, and all Glorious Spirits will inhabit together with thee,
filling it with the sweet Lights of their Divine Beauty, with the Eternal
Flames of their Divine Loves, and Joys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you may say; if this be so, why are not all saved? If all be of
<hi>one Seed,</hi> which is <hi>Christ,</hi> why doth not one Life of Grace, and Glory spring
up in all from that one Seed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> My <hi>Answer</hi> to this <hi>Objection</hi> shall be a threefold use; a <hi>Reproof</hi> to <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi>
a <hi>Root of Comfort;</hi> a <hi>Reason for Holiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 1. A <hi>Reproof to Sinners.</hi> The Sin of the Devil was the first, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Sin: In that therefore the evil Nature of Sin in the whole Kind, and
in every individual Act is most manifest. St. <hi>Jude</hi> painteth it out in its black,
and bloody colours after a most lively manner, <hi>Jude 6. The Angels not keeping
their first Principle (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and forsaking their proper Habitation <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> O
Man! Thy God is thy <hi>first Principle.</hi> Thou didst stand in him, as in thy Root.
Thou wert filled with Sap from him. Thou didst partake of the Fatness, and
Sweetness of the Divine Nature. Thou wert a flourishing and fruitful Tree.
All the Birds of Heaven; the Holy Spirit, the Blessed Angels delighted to
sit, and Sing in thy Branches. All visible things rested under thy Shadow.
How art thou fallen to the ground? How dost thou lie withered, and dead
upon the face of the Earth? No good thing cometh near thee. Sin hath done
this. <hi>Thou hast not kept thy first Principle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Man! The Divine Image was thy <hi>proper Habitation.</hi> This Image in thy
Person was a <hi>Sun</hi> of Beauty shining in every part of it; and a Shield of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
defending it on every side. In this Image all Blessed things were united to
make a Paradise for thee, which thou didst carry about in thine own Person,
as thy proper Form, thine inseparable Habitation, like to God, who carryeth
his own Heaven into every place with him. Alas! Thou art now naked in
the Eye of God, and all the Creatures. Thou art exposed to shame, to every
storm of Rage, Malice, and Wrath from all. Sin hath done this. By Sin thou
hast forsaken thine own, thy proper Habitation.</p>
            <p>Beware, O Men! Of the Evil of Sin. You cast out anew the Divine Seed
out of your Garden by every new act of Sin. You cut off anew the Divine
Form, Flower, and Fruit from every Plant in your Garden by every new
Act of Sin. As oft as you Sin; so oft you make a fresh wound upon the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Unity, you make it to bleed afresh, and dye in your Persons.</p>
            <p>But besides this there is yet a greater Evil in Sin. The Seed of God is
one, the Divine Unity, the Love-spring of Eternity. The Seed of the Serpent
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:49838:195"/>
the Devil is Enmity, the Hellish Spring of Hate and Death. Every Sin is this
Seed of the Serpent in thee, Enmity to the Heavenly Seed, the Unity of God.</p>
            <p>In the Law the Jews were forbidden to seethe a Kid in his Mothers Milk
for the Cruelty, and Unnaturalness. O the cruelty of every Sinner in every
act of Sin! O the unnaturalness! Thou makest a Fire of the Kid, that
thou mayst burn its Mother in it. Thou changest the natural Image, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Life in thee into a fire of Wrath, and Lust, to burn up, and consume in
it the Heavenly Seed, out of which it springeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> in his <hi>Proverbs</hi> telleth us, that he, who curseth his Father, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piseth
his Mother; the Ravens of the Valleys, and the young Eagles shall
pick out his Eyes. This hath its highest truth here: go on in Sin. But know,
that now in each Act of Lust, of Wrath, of Profaneness, of Unbelief, thou
offerest despight to, thou cursest, thou killest the Seed of God in thy self, the
Divine Unity, the purest, and perfectest Love, thy Father, which hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
thee, and thy Mother, which bare thee, which brought thee forth. What
will thine End be? The Ravens of the Vallies, and the young Eagles; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
and devouring Spirits from Hell below, Spirits of blood, of death, of
horrour, and slaughter shall eat thy Flesh, consume all the Light of Life, and
Beauty in thee, shall swallow up thy Spirit into the Bottomless Pits of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Dread, and Death within themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 2. The Root of Comforts in Believing; the Root of Faith, that we
may believe, and have Comfort is the <hi>Divine Unity.</hi> The <hi>Unity</hi> of God is thy
<hi>Seed</hi> in thee. The <hi>Seed</hi> is <hi>one,</hi> and that one <hi>Christ.</hi> The <hi>Unity</hi> of God is the
highest, and purest Love. The Unity of God, Divine Love is the Seed of all
Things, thy Seed. Believe this Love, believe in this Unity, that is in Christ,
who is this one Seed of Love. Let these <hi>Arguments</hi> persuade thee to believe.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Argu.</hi> The Unity of God is the Fountain of Love. The Unity is the
Simplicity, the Purity of the Divine Nature. God in the nakedness and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of his Divine Essence is Love. Lean, stay thy self upon this Rock of
Eternity, the Divine Unity, Simplicity, Purity of Love.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Argu.</hi> The Unity of God is Love; How strong is this Love? All the
Attributes, Powers, Excellencies, Vertues of the God-Head are united, and
centred in Love. How great is the force of Divine Love? What is its
Vertue, its Excellency, its Sweetness? O Almighty, O Supream, O Soveraign
Love! All Things Good, Great, and Divine are joyned, and raised to the highest
point of Unity in Love. God assembled all the Powers, and properties of the
Creation, all the Angels, the Persons in the Trinity to form a shadow of the
Divine Nature in the first Man; saying; <hi>Let us make Man.</hi> O Man! All the
Beauties, Blessedness, and Treasures of the Divine Nature are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
into one Sun of Divine Love to make thee new, no more a Shadow, but a
Sun in this Sun, a Light in this Light of Eternal Love. Open thine Eye, and
thine Heart to this Love by believing it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:49838:195"/>
3. <hi>Argu. Power</hi> consisteth in Unity. The Supreme Unity, which is Love,
is then Almighty, the Supreme, and Soveraign Power. Is any thing impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Almighty Love? Is any thing too hard for it? What change is there,
from Darkness to Light, from pollution to Purity, from profaneness to Piety,
from the hardness of a Stone to the softness, and sweetness of a Dove, from
a Devil to a Blessed Angel, from a Hell to a Heaven, which Almighty Love
cannot make in thine Heart, in a moment, with one cast of its Eye upon
thee?</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Argu.</hi> A simple Unity is <hi>Infinite:</hi> It is ever, every where the same. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
boundeth it, because it is itself alone, and there is no other thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
itself together with it, to give an allay to it, or confine it. This is the
Infiniteness of the Divine Unity. This Unity thus Infinite is Divine Love.</p>
            <p>Come, whoever thou art; Believe, and cast thy self, thy Hopes, thy Fears;
thy Griefs, thy Joys; thy Sins, thy Graces into this Abyss, this Sea of Love,
which hath no Bottom, nor Shore. This will receive them all. This will
swallow them all up into its sweet, and shining Depths. This will cover them
all with its own rich, and glorious Floods, as Waters cover the Sea.</p>
            <p>Come, Believe, and cast thy self, all thy Relations, the delights of thine
Eyes, the dear, and pleasant things of thine Heart, thy whole Spirit, Soul, and
Body into this Infiniteness of Divine Love. Thou shalt find them after many
days, to day, immediately, eternally sporting themselves in this great and
wide Sea of Love.</p>
            <p>Love in the Person of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> descended to the nethermost parts
of the Earth, and ascended above all Heavens, that it might fill all. Behold
now a Deluge of Divine Love in the Resurrection of thy <hi>Jesus.</hi> Love, as a
manifold Fountain of a great Deep from below breaketh up, and breaketh open
itself. Love poureth down itself thorow all the Windows of Heaven opened
upon thee. Thus the Floods of Love increase, rise higher, and higher till they
cover the tops of the highest Mountains of Guilt, or Despair, of Desire, or
hope in thy Spirit: Only do not thou stop these Fountains of Love from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
shut not these Windows of Heaven above to thy self by thy unbelief.
Love in the Person of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> by the mouth of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> cryeth
unto thee; <hi>Open thy Mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> Open all thine outward, and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n this Love. Open them yet wider, wider still. Take in still more of this
<hi>Love.</hi> When thou art full of Love to thine utmost Capacity; still that Love,
which remaineth is infinitely more, infinitely sweeter, than all that, which thou
hast taken in.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Argu.</hi> That <hi>One Seed,</hi> the <hi>Divine</hi> Unity is thy Seed in thee, that is, Love
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tself, the first, the highest Love. <hi>Thou also art his Off-spring. No Man ever
hated his own Flesh. Can a Mother forget her Child?</hi> saith the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love is the Seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of which thou springest. Divine Love is thy Father,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:49838:196"/>
which hath begotten thee; thy Mother, which hath brought thee forth. Can
Love itself hate its own Birth, and Branch? Can Love itself forget its own
Child, the Child of Love?</p>
            <p>The Prodigal returned first to himself; then he thinketh of his Father, and

            <p>O Prodigal! Thou hast wasted thy Beauty, thy Strength, thy Parts, thy
Comforts, thy flourishing hopes among Harlots, in lewd Company, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.
Thou feedest among Swine upon Husks, and thou starvest in the
midst of the Swine, for want of Husks. O Prodigal! The Divine Unity,
the Seed of God, Eternal Love is still thy true self, which lyeth below all these
disguises of Darkness, and Deformity; as <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> lay sleeping at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Ship, which was ready to sink by the violence of the Storm. Thou
art the Seed of God. <hi>For thou also art his Off-spring.</hi> Thou art the Seed of
Love. For <hi>God is Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Prodigal! Open the Eye of thy Spirit. Believe, and see Divine Love
awakening, and appearing in thee, as thy true self to thy self. Feel it drawing
thee by a sweet and irresistible force to itself, that is, to thy self, from whence
thou hast so long wandered in a strange Form by the Sorcery of Sin, and the
Devil. Believe, and see Divine Love, in the true Forms of thy Father, and
of Heaven opening their Bosom again to thee, sending forth a vertue of
Heavenly Love from themselves, with which they touch thy Heart, soften i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

melt it into kindly repentings, a lovely shame, and tears of Love; kindling
sweet desires, lively hopes, and ardent longings in thee after thy Father, and
Heaven thine own Country.</p>
            <p>Believe, and see Divine Love, thy Father coming into the midst of the
Swine to thee, carrying thee in a rich Chariot made of his own Bosom, and
Embraces, heaping kisses upon thee, as he carryeth thee. So Love bringeth
thee home to its own House, the Heavenly Palace of Love. There Divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Love cloatheth thee with the best Garment, its own Native, and Divine
Loveliness: Love feasteth thee with its own Joys, as they have sprung up
thorow a Death for thee into a Resurrection for thee also. Love sweetneth,
heightneth all thy entertainment with its own Musick resounding with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Harmony from all Heavenly Hearts, all Glorified Spirits round about
thee, yea, from all things in Heaven, and Earth tuned by the Eternal Spirit of
Love itself, and plaid upon in a most exact, and charming Consort.</p>
            <p>Return then to thy true self, thy Father, and to Heaven: Heavenly Love is
all these. It is also thy way to these; thy Light, and thy Life in the way.
Believe: Say not now; O that I could believe, and repent! Heavenly Love
will form itself into inward Divine Meltings, Repentings, Acts of Faith, and
of all Grace in thee. Look to this Love, and live Eternally in the Bosom of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:49838:196"/>
Love. The Unity of God, which is Love is thy Root, which will rise up unto
a Divine sap, and form itself into all Divine Fruit in thee if thou wait for it.
<hi>For thou art the Off-spring of God.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Use. 3. The Unity of God is the Root, and Reason of Holiness.</hi> The Unity of
God is the Fountain of Love, of all Grace, and Comfort in the Gospel The
Promises are all made to this one Seed, which is <hi>Christ</hi> in the Unity of the
Spirit, in the Unity of the Divine Nature. Thou hast then no further any
part, or portion in the promises of the Gospel, or the Comforts of Love,
than thou abidest in the Unity of Christ, and of the Spirit. It is the Seed of

on which no Rain, or Dew of any Divine Grace, or Promise descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.
Abide then in this Love, which is the Holy Seed in thee; bring forth
the Fruits of this <hi>Love</hi> in thy whole <hi>Life.</hi> So shalt thou be Blessed in thy
Seed, and in thy Deed. I have now finished the <hi>third Argument</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
and explication of the <hi>third Description</hi> of Divine Love which
was this; <hi>The Love of God is the God of Love.</hi> For <hi>the Unity of God is the
most high, and holy Love.</hi> I pass now to the <hi>fourth,</hi> and last <hi>Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Argu. The Mystery of the Trinity is a Mystery of Divine Love.</hi> This is
the fourth Argument to prove, that <hi>God is Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Divine Philosopher defineth <hi>Love</hi> to be a <hi>Birth in a Beautiful Subject.</hi>
As the <hi>New Hierusalem</hi> is said to come down out of Heaven, a Bride ready
trimmed: so out of the Bosom of Divine Love opening itself, as a Heaven
cometh forth the Divine Loveliness, the Garden of Heaven, the Heavenly
Paradise. This is the Heavenly Bride. In this Garden Love planteth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
to grow all Beautiful, and Divine Images, all Heavenly Pleasures, and Joys.</p>
            <p>Divine Love, and the Holy Trinity agree in this, that they are a <hi>Birth,</hi> and
a <hi>Marriage</hi> both in one. This Mystery is figured in Paradise in the first Man.
<hi>Adam</hi> bringeth <hi>Eve</hi> forth from himself. Then <hi>Adam</hi> bringeth forth <hi>all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
in and by <hi>Eve. Adam</hi> first bringeth forth <hi>Eve,</hi> the Beautiful Image of
himself, and of that Paradise, which he then comprehended, and carryed about
with him in his own Person. Then he brought forth all Beautiful Images of
Humane Life, and Humane Nature in this Beautiful Subject by the Love-union
of a Paradisical Marriage.</p>
            <p>In like manner the Supream <hi>Love</hi> first bringeth forth the Supream Loveliness,
the Image of itself. Then it marryeth itself to this Beautiful Image, and bringeth
forth in the Bosom of it all Lives, Loves, Lovelinesses. Delights, and Glories.</p>
            <p>Thus Divine <hi>Love</hi> is a Trinity. There are <hi>three</hi> in Divine <hi>Love.</hi> 1. The
<hi>Love-spring,</hi> or the Divine Fountain of Love. 2. The <hi>Love-Birth,</hi> or the
Divine Birth, and Image of Love, the Supream Loveliness. 3. The <hi>Love-union,</hi>
the Divine Union between these two, the Sacred Fountain, and the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:49838:197"/>
Image. These are the <hi>three Properties</hi> in Divine Love, which are all <hi>one
Love;</hi> as there are <hi>three Persons</hi> in the Divine Nature, which <hi>three</hi> are <hi>one
God.</hi> In <hi>Love,</hi> and in <hi>God</hi> these <hi>three</hi> are the same Divine Love, the same
Divine Nature standing in distinct and opposite Relations to itself, within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
infinitely above all things without itself. These Relations are in both the
same.</p>

all the Beautiful, Sweet, and Blessed Fruits of Love.</p>
            <p>Learn here, how Honourable Marriage is, and to keep the Bed of Love
undefiled. God hath Sealed upon it the Image of the most Holy, and Blessed
Trinity, the Trinity of Divine Love, the Trinity in the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>Marriage in Paradise was the fairest, and fullest Figure of the highest and
sweetest Mystery in Heaven, the Ever-Blessed Trinity. The <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
before the coming of the Lord Jesus were for the most part strangers to
the Doctrine of the Trinity. They were therefore loose, and dissolute in the
rites of Marriage. They made nothing of Fornication, and very little of
Adultery. The Lord in the Revelation of the Gospel at once unvaileth the
glorious face of the God-Head in the most Blessed Trinity; and discovereth
the sweet, and beautiful Figure of it in the Holy State of Marriage.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour by the Appearance of the Divine Nature in its numbeless Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
shining thorow every Created Form in his own Mysterious Person, as
thorow their proper Figures, and Images hath restored all things. He hath
restored Marriage not only to its primitive institution in Paradise, but to its
Eternal Pattern, and Original in Heaven, the high, and holy Trinity. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
carefully this Marriage-Glory pure from Lusts, untroubled by passions:
So shall you see with the Joy of Paradise the sacred Impression of that supream
Mystery of all Divine Loves, Lovelinesses, and Delights the Trinity in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature set, as the Seal of Eternity upon it. So shall you draw down
the Trinity itself with all its secret, and sacred Treasures of Blessedness to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
with you in it. Blessed are they, who hold the Band of Marriage unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed,
unbroken in the sweet, and beautiful Type, in the Glorious Truth of
the Heavenly Unity in the most Blessed Trinity.</p>
            <p>We have said something in general to shew, how the Mystery of the
Trinity is a Mystery of Divine Love. Let us launch a little further into this
Sea of unexpressible Sweetnesses, and Beauties by contemplating this God-Head
of pure loves in the several Persons of the Trinity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:49838:197"/>
1. The God-Head in the first Person; the Father is Divine Love in its
Fountain. The <hi>Father</hi> in the Trinity is the <hi>Love-spring</hi> in Eternity: A D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
plenitude, or fulness, an unfathomable deep of Divine, and Unexpressible
Sweetness ever rising up, ever flowing, overflowing all things; this is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Person of the <hi>Father</hi> in the Trinity, this is the Sacred Spring of <hi>Divine
Love</hi> in Eternity; and this is that Fountain so dear to you, O ye Saints! out of
which you all are made to drink that Sacred Fountain of <hi>Free-Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall endeavour to open this beloved Fountain, the streams of which are
the Life, Love, and Joy of all things in Heaven above, and on the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
by three precious inlets into it.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Inlet. The Person of the Father is Divine Love in its Glory. St. Paul</hi>
speaking of the <hi>Father</hi> terminateth all the mysteries of the Gospel in the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Grace,</hi> as the Beginning, and the end of them all, the sweet, and
shining Sea, from which they come, into which they all run again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grace</hi> is the name of <hi>Love</hi> in its <hi>Freedom, Sweetness,</hi> and <hi>Fulness.</hi> Every
thing is in its Glory, in its Fountain. For there it is fairest, freshest, sweetest,
and fullest. Love is in its Fountain in the Person of the Father. For there
Love is in its Glory. There is a <hi>Three-fold</hi> Crown; the Marriage-Crown; the
Crown of a King; the Crown of a Conqueror. There is accordingly a
Three-fold Glory. 1. There is the Glory of <hi>Beauty.</hi> This is that of the
Sun which sendeth forth his Beams thorow all things, and outshineth all things
among the Earthly, and Heavenly Bodies. 2. There is the Glory of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
which ruleth over all. 3. There is the Glory of Victory, which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth
all things to itself, and maketh every thing an Ornament to its Triumph.</p>
            <p>This Three-fold Crown doth Love wear, this Three-fold Glory is it
cloathed with in the Person of the Father. It is the Eternal Sun, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth,
enliveneth, sweetneth, cheareth all things by its Beams sent forth
thorow all from the heights of the Heavens above to the depths of the Sea,
and the center of the Earth below. It also infinitely surmounteth all things
in Beauty, and Sweetness; as it shineth Eternally. It is the great King, that
swayeth, and ruleth all every where by its Golden Scepter. It is the Glorious
Conqueror, which pierceth deep into the hearts of all, which subdueth all to
itself by its flaming Sword of Paradise turning every way. By this Sword
it cutteth off, and consumeth all Flesh, and Earth, to keep that out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
and from the Tree of Life. By this Sword it refineth, and converteth all
into a pure, and Heavenly Flame, into Spirit. So it bringeth them into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
to the Tree of Life in the midst of it. Every thing every where doth
Victorious Love make the Subject of its Conquests, and the Ornament of its
Triumphs.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>Divine Love</hi> in its <hi>Glory,</hi> in its <hi>Fountain.</hi> This is the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
in the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Father.</hi> This is the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Free-Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Inlet</hi> into the Fountain of Divine Love. <hi>All the Riches of Love are
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:49838:198"/>
seated in the Person of the Father.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> applyeth the Riches of Grace
to the Father, <hi>Ephes. 1. 7. According to the Riches of his Grace. Three</hi> things
meet in Riches, Preciousness, Plenty, Power. Every thing is purest, and so
most precious; every thing is most united, and so most plentiful, and so most
powerful; every thing thus is richest in its Fountain. The first Person is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Divine Love. For in him are the riches of Grace. Love is Richest in the
Father. The heart of the Father is the Treasury of Love. No where is Love so
pure, so unal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayed, so precious, as in the heart of the Father. Traffick, O Man,
for the Treasure of this Love with all thy faculties, with all that thou hast, and
art. This Merchandise is beyond that of Gold, and Rubies: Traffick to this
Coast of Spices, to this Land of rich, and precious Cordials, the Land of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
Love, the heart of the Father. No where is Love so plentiful, in such
abundance, as in the heart of the Father: The heart of the Father is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
larger than the Sea: yet doth Love cover it, as waters do the Sea, where it is
deepest, when it is fullest. Cast thy world of Sins, O guilty Soul, with all
thy Mountains of guilt into this Sea of Love. Love shall cover them, that
they shall never appear more. If thou seek for them, thou shalt not find them.
Come, drink thy fill of Loves, O dry, and thirsty Soul, from this rich, and
full Spring in the heart of the Father. Come, thou most insatiate Soul, cast thy
self into this full Sea of Loves in the Bosom of the Father, hath thy self,
roul thy self in the midst of its rich Billows, which rise as high as Heaven.
No where is Love so powerful, so irresistible, so full of vertue, as in the heart
of the Father. Wash thy heart in this Fountain, and it shall be healed of the
Leprosy of every Lust. Lay thy heart down in this Spring in the Bosom of
the Father, and all its hardnesses shall be dissolved. Drink in these waters of
Love fresh from the heart of the Father, and it shall be a powerful Cordial
in thine heart. It shall restore thy Life, thy Strength, the complexion of thy
Soul, thy Beauty, thy Spirits, thy Joys as at first, as in Paradise, as in Heaven,
as in thine Eternal Original.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Inlet. The Father in the Trinity is the Fountain of all Relations, and so
the Fountain of Love. Father</hi> is the sweetest of all Names, the Name of the
highest, tenderest, purest, and most perfect sweetness. A Father is the first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and the Fountain of all Relations. <hi>Adam</hi> was first a Father, then a
Husband. So the Humane Nature from him streamed forth into Husband,
and Wives, Sons, and Daughters, Brethren, and Sisters, into all Degrees of
Kindred, Allyances, and Friendships.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephes. 3. 15. St. Paul</hi> saith, that from the <hi>Father the whole Family in
Heaven, and Earth is named.</hi> Some render that word <hi>Family,</hi> the <hi>Fatherhood,</hi>
or <hi>Paternity, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> All Fathers in that Relation, all the Fatherhoods, and
Paternities of every Father in Heaven, and Earth lyeth first in that first Father,
the first Person in the Trinity, as in their Fountain.</p>
            <p>What comfort is this to every tender, careful grieved Father of every sick,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:49838:198"/>
sinful, or lost Child. The true Father to thy Child, which acteth the part
of the Father behind the vail of the shadowy Father in thee, is the Father in
the Trinity. He is the strength, sweetness, and truth of the Relation every
where. The Paternity, the Fatherhood every where is named from him.</p>
            <p>But if we take the word according to our Translation, it affordeth us the
same sweet sense more fully. <hi>The whole Family in Heaven, and Earth is named
from him,</hi> from the Father of our Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> A Family is a chain of Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which are as so many Links in the chain fastned one to another, Father,
Mother, Husband, Wife, Brother, Sister, Children, Friends. All these are
named from the Eternal Father. All these sweet, dear names of Union, of
Love, agree first, most properly, most truly to him, who is the Supream Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Original, and Fountain of all Unions, of all Love. All these are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from him. He is the true Parent in the Parents, the true Child, Husband,
Wife, Brother, Sister, Friend in thy Child, thy Husband, thy Wife, thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
thy Sister, thy Friends. He is descended into all these, shadoweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
under them, subsisteth, as the truth, and substance in them. It is this des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of his in them, this Presence, and Appearance of his, which giveth these
names to them. Love is either the Relation itself, or the Blood, which runneth
along in the vein of every Relation. Every Relation is a Union. Every Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is Love in its proper kind, and degree. The Original, the Fountain of
all Unions, of all Loves, of all Relations is the Supream Unity, which is the Father,
the first Person in the Trinity. All Relations in Heaven, and Earth, all Unions
are broken pieces of the great Diamond of Divine Love. The Father is this
great Diamond of Divine Love, Entire, Eternal, the first, and highest Unity, in
which all Unions lie together undivided, compleat, making up one Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which hath the names, and rellishes of all sweetnesses, which giveth
name, and rellish to every sweetness, which is above all names, and rellishes,
unexpressible, incomprehensible. This is the Love-spring in the Trinity of
Divine Love. This is the Father in the Trinity of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 1. Give all Glory to <hi>Free-Grace.</hi> Ascribe all Riches to it. Set your
Love upon it. This is the Fountain of Divine Love in the Bosom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This is the Fountain of <hi>Israel.</hi> This is the Fountain of the God Head.
This is your own, your only Fountain, O Saints! All your streams of Life,
Grace, Comfort, Glory arise out of this Love-spring in Eternity, which is the
heart of the Father. This is the Fountain, this is the Father of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
your Fountain, and Father in him.</p>
            <p>He that hath drunk the Waters of Life, and Love from this Well, will
never thirst more after any other Waters, or drink of any other Spring. We
read in <hi>Numbers</hi> of a <hi>Well</hi> in the Wilderness, which the <hi>Princes digged with
their Staves, and sung to it; Spring O Well.</hi> O wandring Souls, behold your
Well, which is before you in every Wilderness. The Prince of Life, your
<hi>Jesus</hi> hath dig'd, and opened it for you from the depths of the God-Head
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:49838:199"/>
with the Staff, the Scepter of his Spirit. Look to no other Fountain. But
sing continually to this; Spring O Well; Spring O thou heart of the Father;
Spring in mine heart; Spring with streams of Divine Truth; Spring with
streams of Divine Strength; Spring with streams of Divine Joy; Send forth
thy streams over all my Soul, and Body; Make all my powers, and parts to
sing like the Garden of <hi>Eden!</hi> O thou Fountain of Gardens, My Prince hath
dig'd, and opened thee in my heart, O thou heart of the Father, with the
Staff of his Spirit. Open mine Eyes, O Blessed Spirit, that by thee I may see
this Fountain, which by thee is opened in me!</p>
            <p>It was at the Fountain, that Jacob, and his beloved <hi>Rachel</hi> first met. The
Daughters of <hi>Laban</hi> came thither to water their Flocks. But the Well had a
great stone upon it, which they could not move. <hi>Jacob</hi> rolled away the Stone,
and watered their Flocks for them: From thence they brought <hi>Jacob</hi> to their
Fathers House, knew him for their neer Kinsman, and were marryed to him. It is
at this Fountain of Free-Grace, that the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and the elect Soul first
meet. Sin, Death, and Wrath make the Stone, which cover this Spring. The
Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> rolleth away this Stone, that thou, and all thy Fathers Flocks with
thee, all the Principles, and Powers of Life in thee may drink of this Well.
Here the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> looketh upon thee, and loveth thee. Here he maketh
himself known to thee, to be thy Brother, and taketh thee to be his Bride:
From this Well he goeth home with thee unto thy Fathers House, into thine
heart, into thy natural Spirit, and thine Earthly Image, in these to marry thee to
himself, to make the fruitful to Eternal Glory, to enclose this door of thy natural
Spirit with Boards of <hi>Cedar,</hi> a Divine Beauty, Sweetness, and Incorruptibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to build upon the wall of thine Earthly Image, a Palace of Silver, into
which he will invite his Father, the Holy Angels, all glorified Spirits to feast,
and inhabit with himself, and thee.</p>
            <p>There was often contention for Wells between the Servants of <hi>Abimelech,</hi>
and the Servants of <hi>Isaac.</hi> These digged them, and the others stopped them up.
Contend, O Believers, for this your Well of Free-Grace: Suffer no <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
or <hi>Philistines,</hi> to stop it up by casting in the Earth, or Stones, and Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
of <hi>Free-Will,</hi> of any Wisdom, Work, or Worth in the Creature. As
Earth cast into a Spring defileth it: so by every thing of the Creature ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the Waters of this Fountain, they lose their clearness, their sweetness,
their vertue.</p>
            <p>Keep this Spring of the Fathers heart, of Free-Grace pure. So shalt thou
see a clear, shining deep of Divine Sweetnesses without any Bottom, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Deep of Eternity itself. In the clearness of this Spring shalt thou see
thine own Face. From the freshness of this Spring thou shalt drink in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
new Floods of all living Sweetnesses. With the pure Waters of this
Spring thou shalt preserve thine heart ever new, ever soft, ever flourishing
with all Joys, ever fruitful in all Graces. O Saints! Keep this Love-Spring,
the Fountain of Free-Grace open, keep it pure in your Spirits.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Use.</hi> 2. Learn this Divine skill, O Christians, which comprehendeth all the
rich mysteries of the Gospel in it. Rise up new every moment with all things
round about you out of this Fountain of Love in Eternity, the Bosom of the
Father. Return again every moment with all your troop into this Fountain
of Love, the Bosom of the Father. Lay your selves down for ever here
Here alone is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in his naked Beauties, nakedly embraced.</p>
            <p>Seek, see, and enjoy all your pleasant Relations, all pleasant Unions in this
Unity of Divine Love, the heart of the Father, as in their proper Fountain.
Here is the Truth, here is the Life of them all, in their Original. Here they
are unchangeable. Here they are, as Sun-beams, before they come forth, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,
divide, grow shadowy, and fading.</p>
            <p>As we keep Flowers fresh by setting their stalks in Water: So say of all
your Relations in their shadows on Earth, of all your sweet things with their
Sweetnesses; <hi>Who is their Father?</hi> Answer thy self; <hi>The Fountain of Love.</hi>
Then keep them with their stalks in this Fountain. So shall they be ever fresh,
ever sweet to thee.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Person. The Love-Birth. God is Love.</hi> The <hi>three Persons</hi> in the Trinity
are <hi>Love</hi> in a <hi>three-fold Form, and Property,</hi> or in a <hi>threefold Distinct,</hi> and <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Relation</hi> to itself, within itself, for the enjoyment of itself in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
of Eternity, abstracted from all Creatures, infinitely before them, and
above them. I have spoken of the <hi>first Person</hi> in this <hi>Trinity</hi> of Divine <hi>Love,</hi>
the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Fountain of Love</hi> in Eternity. I come now to speak of the
<hi>second Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>God-Head</hi> in the <hi>second Person</hi> is <hi>Divine Love in its Eternal Birth, and
Image,</hi> The Fountain of Divine Love, which is the <hi>Father,</hi> bringeth forth
from itself, within itself an Eternal Birth, the compleat Image of itself, the
Supreme Loveliness, and Beauty. This is our <hi>Jesus</hi> in the Bosom of the Father.</p>
            <p>I shall endeavour to draw the Curtain from before this Blessed, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Birth of Divine Love, the Beloved, the only one of all Holy, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Spirits. I shall endeavour to set this most desired, and most pleasant
Person our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> before the Eyes of your mind by <hi>five Characters,</hi> or
<hi>Marks.</hi> The second Person in the Trinity is. 1. The <hi>Birth,</hi> or Image of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love. 2. The <hi>First.</hi> 3. The <hi>Fairest.</hi> 4. The <hi>Freshest.</hi> 5. The <hi>Fullest</hi>
Birth, and Image of Divine Love.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Character.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is the <hi>Birth,</hi> or Image of Divine Love. The
Heathen in their Divinity tell us of two <hi>Twin-Loves</hi> in Heaven, which exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answer one the other. Thus Love, which is the Divine Nature, subsisteth in
two Forms, two Persons, the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> which are <hi>two Loves,</hi> and
the <hi>same,</hi> equally compleat, equally loving, equally lovely, equally beloved.
<hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise brought forth <hi>Eve</hi> to be ever <hi>before him, a meet help for
him.</hi> So the Father, and Fountain of Love bringeth forth in its own Bosom
this Son of Love, this Divine Image of Love, to be ever before it, a meet help
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:49838:200"/>
to it, that Love in this entire Image of itself may perfectly behold, possess,

            <p>
               <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. The Father speaketh to <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> from Heaven: <hi>This is
my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Jesus Christ</hi> is the Supreme ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Divine Love, the Supreme Loveliness, and so the Birth, or Image of
Divine Love, the Son of Loves. In Divine things every faculty, or power
brinketh forth its proper object, which is its perfection from itself, within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that it may be independent, and undivided in all its Joys, in all its Glories.
The Divine understanding is the Sun, and Spring of Divine Truth, which is
the light of its Life, its Object, and its Beauty. The Divine Will is the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of all Divine goodness, which is its proper Object, and Crown. There it
Eternally riseth up. There it Eternally resteth. So <hi>Divine Love</hi> in the Person
of the <hi>Father</hi> is the <hi>Parent,</hi> and the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> of the <hi>Divine Loveliness</hi> in
the Person of the Son. <hi>This is my Beloved Son,</hi> saith the Father from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>in whom I am well pleased.</hi> All the Joys of the Father are full; all his
pleasures compleat here. All Seeds of Love in the heart of the Father are
here sprung up into the fair Flowers of all Beauty, into the ripe Fruit of all
delights within his own Bosom in the Person of <hi>Christ.</hi> This is the only Birth,
Image, and Object of the Father, the Love-Spring; its <hi>Birth,</hi> and its Bride
within itself. The Father, the Love-Spring bringeth forth this Love-Birth,
and lovely Image, the Son of Love; that Love may be both, a Bridegroom,
and a Bride to itself.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> Prince called <hi>Alcibiades</hi> his <hi>Garden of Pleasure.</hi> The Father
in the Trinity is the Fountain of Love: The Son is the Garden of Love ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
up within this Fountain. Here the Father of Love soweth all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Seeds of Divine Love. Here so soon, as they are sown, they spring up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ripe Fruits, of which the Father eateth, and with which he delighteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his Garden. This is the Circle of Eternity; Love Eternally sowing
the rich Seeds, Eternally feasting upon the ripe Fruits of Divine Love in his
Garden of Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 1. Christians, seek your selves, your Love-Birth in this Eternal Love-Birth
of the Son. Seek the Original, and true Image of your selves in this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Image of Divine Love. See your selves, seeds of Love sown in this
Garden of Love from Eternity; ripe Fruits of Love flourishing in it Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.
This is the dearest Jewel of a Saint; that Jewel, which the Saints wear
in their Bosom, next their heart, with the sight of which they renew their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
and their beauty, recreate all their spiritual senses; I mean the rich Jewel
of <hi>Electing Love,</hi> the <hi>Love of Election.</hi> In this Jewel a Believer seeth with
the Eye of his Faith God the Father, the Fountain of Love in Eternity, God
the Son an Eternal Birth of Divine Love from this Fountain, an Eternal
Image, an Eternal Garden of Divine Love in this Fountain; himself born in
this birth of Love, himself a lovely Image in this Image of Love, himself a
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:49838:200"/>
Tree of Love in this Garden of Love. Blessed is he, who hath this Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in his heart, and from Heaven, that <hi>he was born here;</hi> that here he rose up
first out of the heart of the Father; that here he first appeared to the Eye of
the Father; that here the Father set his Love upon him, and took pleasure in
him. <hi>He hath saved us,</hi> saith <hi>St. Paul</hi> of the Father, <hi>Not according to works
which we have done, but according to his own purpose, and Grace given to us in
Jesus Christ before the World was,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9. <hi>Grace given to us in Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the World was.</hi> See your Love-birth in the Eternal Love-birth of the
Lord Jesus, O Believers. <hi>His purpose, and Grace given to us in Jesus Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the World was.</hi> See the Fountain of Divine Love in the heart of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>his purpose,</hi> and all the Births, all the Images, all the Gardens of Divine
Love rising up from the sweet, and blessed depths of that Fountain, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in that only Birth, that only Image, that only Garden of Divine
Love, the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 2. Seek this Love-Birth in your selves. <hi>When it pleased the Father to
reveal his Son in me;</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of the new Birth in himself.
When the Father openeth himself, as a Fountain of Divine Love in your
Spirits; when the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> ariseth up, and appeareth to you, as the Birth,
and Image of Divine Love within this Fountain; when your selves appear in
him one Love-Birth in this Fountain of Love together with him; then may
you rejoice, and say; now I live; now I am new-born from the Love-spring
on high, in the highest Glory. You that have the mystery of this Divine
Birth revealed in you, who see the Garden of Love flourishing in the midst
of the Fountain of Love within you; retire into this Fountain, into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the Fountain, the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in the Bosom of the Father. Walk there,
solace your selves there, hide your selves among the Trees of Divine Loveliness,
and Love from the strife of Spirits. Here you shall be fed with the Fruit from
these Trees, until the storm of Wrath be over past.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Character. The Son of God is the first Birth of Divine Love.</hi> It is said of
him, <hi>Mic. 5. 3. His goings forth are from everlasting.</hi> The goings forth of
the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> the first Birth, and Image of Divine Love from the Bosom of
the Father, the Fountain of Love are Eternal, without Beginning. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
forth of the Light, which is the first, the beautiful Birth, and Image of
the Sun, were from the beginning of the Creation. So soon, as the Sun had
a being, it had Beams. There was no moment, in which the Sun was without
its circle of Beams, no more, than the Beams were without the Sun. In like
manner the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> who is the Light, the Brightness, the Beautiful Image
of Divine Love had his Birth from Eternity together with the Being of the
Father. This Fountain in Eternity was no more without this Image the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of all its Beauties shining in the midst of it, than this living, and lovely
Image of all Glories was without its Fountain, from the unsearchable depth of
whose Divine sweetnesses it riseth up continually. The Father is no more
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:49838:201"/>
without the Son, than the Son without the Father. Both are from Eternity,
both equally Eternal in this sacred Mystery, and Trinity of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of Divine Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. This Son of Love is brought in speaking of himself, and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<hi>Before the Mountains were formed, ere yet the foundations of the Earth
were laid, I was before him, as one brought up with him, his delight day by day.</hi>
Before all the Creatures in Eternity, the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> alone was with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and none other besides him. He was bred up together with him, the
Lamb, the lovely, the beloved Birth, and Object of all his Loves, the delight
of his Eyes, that fed at his Table, and lay in his Bosom. If you ask now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what the Father did, before he made the World; the answer is full, and sweet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Father in the infiniteness of Eternity brought forth <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> delighted

               <hi>John 1. 14. We,</hi> saith the Holy Apostle speaking of <hi>Jesus Christ, saw his
Glory, the Glory, as of the Only-begotten Son of God.</hi> The Son of God is the
only Birth of Love from the Father the Fountain of Love, in two respects;
<hi>Comparatively; Comprehensively. First,</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is the only Birth, and
Image of Divine Love <hi>Comparatively</hi> for his excelling loveliness. <hi>We saw his
Glory, as the Glory of the Only-begotten of the Father.</hi> So great a Glory shineth
in his Person, as darkneth all other Beauties, all other Births, and Images of

and Image of Divine Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 1. O Sinners! This is that <hi>Jesus,</hi> who wooeth you, the fairest of all
things, Beauty itself, the Divine, the Supreme Beauty. Object no more against
him, and your union with him. <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. Say not, you are unworthy of him, it

to please him, to honour him. <hi>Ans.</hi> He, who offereth himself to be your
Beauty, and Loveliness, will be your Lover, your Bridegroom. This Glorious

All your Fruit shall be from him. He, who is the fairest Birth, and Image from

            <p>This is thy Beauty, thy Beloved, thy <hi>Jesus,</hi> O Believer. Trust thy self to

            <p>4. <hi>Character. The Lord Jesus is the freshest Birth, and Image of Divine
Love,</hi> that is, <hi>of the Divine Nature.</hi> The <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Love-Spring</hi> in Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
speaketh to the <hi>Son,</hi> his <hi>Love-Birth</hi> thus: <hi>To day have I begotten thee, Psal.</hi>
2. The principal, and terminating sense of these words is the <hi>Eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Son in the Trinity. Eternity is one continued day, ever present,
never past, never to come, above all Succession. So is the Generation of this
<hi>Love-Birth</hi> ever perfect, ever present, never past. This is true from one end
of Eternity to the other, if we may so speak of that, which hath neither
Beginning, nor End, <hi>to day</hi> hath the Father begotten the Son. <hi>Eternity is Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible.
All Acts, all Joys, all Things</hi> of <hi>Eternity</hi> are <hi>together at once, in one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>three Rules,</hi> which our Divines lay down concerning this Act of
the Generation of the Son by the Father in the Trinity.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Rule.</hi> This Birth of Divine Love is perfect from Eternity, perfectly
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:49838:202"/>
sprung up, perfectly brought forth from the Fountain of Love, the Bosom of
the Father. The reason of this is the Unity of the Divine Essence. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, the Essence of Love, the God-head is one, equally Eternal in the
<hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Rule.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> the lovely Image of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vine Love is ever in the
Birth, ever newly rising up out of the Fountain of Love to Eternity. For
the Act of Divine Generation, of the Divine Birth in the Mystery, and Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Divine Love is Eternal, one continued Act from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Rule.</hi> This Birth, and Image of Divine Love, the Son ever lyeth in its
Fountain, the Bosom of the Father. This ariseth from the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Essence,</hi>
and the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> in this glorious secret of Eternal Love. These
Love-Persons in the same Love-Substance are ever distinct, never divided.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hose. 6. 3. The coming forth of Christ,</hi> as the anointed, and anointing of
Divine Love, is said to be, <hi>as the Morning.</hi> The Love-Birth of our <hi>Jesus</hi> is in
this sense, as the Morning. It is ever new, ever fresh, ever pleasant, as the
lovely Summer-Morning in its first Sweetnesses, and Light, in its Virgin-Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
and Pleasures. It was a Divine Sentence of a Holy, and learned Bishop
in the primitive times: <hi>All that God doth from Eternity to Eternity, is the
bringing forth of Jesus Christ.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is at once a lovely morning for
new, and fresh Sweetnesses; ever a glorious noon for the height of his Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the brightness of his light. He is a lovely Rose ever in the Bud, ever
full-blown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 1. Chuse <hi>Christ:</hi> Refuse the Creature. Take into your Bosom this
Love-Birth of the Father. Cast out of your Bosom your own Love-Births
in the Creature. All these are Flowers, which wither, and dye away, either
upon their stalk, or in your hand. Every thing of the Creature declineth so
soon, as it cometh to its height. The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is ever the same, ever full,
ever fresh, a fruitful Autumn, and a floury Spring both in one continually.
This is your <hi>Inheritance Incorruptible, Undefiled, that passeth not away, 1 Pet.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 2. Ever believe, as freshly, as freely, as at the first moment of your
Conversion, as in the first Act of Believing. The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> the ground and
object of your Faith is ever fresh, ever new. All thy Sins against the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Marriage-Bed of thine Heavenly Bridegroom in thine heart can make
no impression upon him. He is New-born to thee from the unsearchable
depths of Divine sweetness in the heart of the Father every moment. He
springeth up a new Love-Birth in the Fountain of Love every moment with
all his lovelinesses fresh, fair, and full, like a Rose new-blown; as if now alone
they had first appeared.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Character. Jesus Christ in the sacred Trinity is the fullest Birth, and Image
of Divine Love from the Father, the Fountain of Love.</hi> Our Saviour is called
<hi>The Power of God, 1 Corin.</hi> 1. Whatever the Father hath brought forth from
the Eternal spring of Love, of the God-Head; whatever he doth, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

            <p>As the Father is the first Unity: so the Son is the first distinction, or varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The first is the highest distinction, and variety, the fullest distinction,

the Unity of Love, the Love-spring; so the Son is the variety of Love, the
entire Image of all Loves, and Lovelinesses. All things in Heaven, in Earth,
and under the Earth lie together here in this Image, in the perfect Harmony

this Image of Love, this variety of Love, the first, the full distinction,

<hi>Christ,</hi> we should then rejoice to see each dear, or displeasing object, each state,

Beasts appearing in this Image of Divine Love are the Eternal Spirit, the

Cross in this Garden of Love is a Tree of Eternal Love, thou art the fair, and
sweet Fruit upon this Tree. The breakings of Bones looked upon in this

Love are no Wounds, but Divine Anointings. The tortures of the whole

into two Persons, the Father, and the Son, from both these by a conspiration
of Love doth breath forth itself into one third person, the Holy Spirit, in
which they both stand two distinct Persons in one third Person, which is the
Love-union, the golden Marriage knot of them both. The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

all the several sweetnesses remain distinct, mutual penetrating, and infusing each
the other in that one sweetness distinct from them all. So the Father, and
the Son by the force, and mystery of Divine Love, breath forth themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one distinct Person, the Holy Ghost, in which they also remain distinct,
distinctly, and mutually, penetrating, possessing, enjoying the Persons

            <p>It is a saying, which <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> citeth from St. <hi>Austin: Whatever
there is of Sweetness, of Pleasantness, of Complacency, of Delight, of Joy, of
Love, of Loveliness, of Agreeableness, of Suitableness, of Harmony any where;
it is the Holy Ghost.</hi> The reason is this: All Colours with their several
Beauties are the mixtures of shade, and light. Children are the Parents uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
So every thing of Love, or Beauty; every Divine Work, and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thorow Heaven, and Earth is the Love-union between the Father, the
Fountain of Love, and this lovely Image, which is both the Birth, and the
Bride of Love, of the Father. All Pleasa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Providence with their several Lights, Lives, Loves, and Vertues are this
Love-union in its lovely extent, and vast variety. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith of God:
<hi>Thou hast stretched out the Heavens by thy Breath, by thy Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Heavens</hi>
are the Beauty, the Pleasantness, and Joy of the Divine Appearance, and the

            <p>2 <hi>Beware of Passion the Contrariety to Love. Sampson</hi> tied Foxes together
by their Tails with Firebrands between them. So he sent them forth to burn
up the standing Corn of the <hi>Philistines</hi> in the Fields. O men! when ye fall
from the Wisdom of God into the Subtlety of the Serpent, you become Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
not Men. Your Lusts, your Carnal Interests are your Tayls, by which
you are tied together in all your Unions, and Commerce; your Passions are
Fire-brands fastned to your Tayls. Thus the Devil sendeth you forth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
and consume the Beauties, the Peace, the Comforts each of other, of the
whole Creation round about you. Behold the true Figure of Passionate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

            <p>In the Holy of Holies was placed a Mercy-Seat all of Beaten Gold, the
Throne of Grace, the Throne of Love. Out of this Throne of one piece
with it, rose up two Cherubims of Beaten Gold. They stretched forth their
Wings they set their faces one to the other. They together looked down to
the Mercy-Seat. This is the Heavenly Figure of your Christ, and you, O ye
Children of Love, in your Love-Union, and Spiritual Communion. God in
<hi>Christ,</hi> Christ in the Glory of the Father is the Golden Mercy-Seat, the
Throne of Love. The Saints are the Cherubims, the Children of Love rising
up from the Throne of Love, of one piece of Gold, of one Love-Spirit
with it. With their Faces, their Divine part they look one to another, and
maintain a mutual society. They spread their Hearts, their Spiritual under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
their Spiritual affections to each other, and so meet, so embrace.
With united Spirits they look down to the Throne of Love in the midst of
them, out of which they grow up together, from which they continually
draw fresh Beams, fresh Love, life, and Joy.</p>
            <p>O Saints, O Holy Souls be rooted in Love, grow up out of this Throne
of Love, Shine forth with Faces of Love, spread forth wings of Love. Be
in all things one piece, one pure Gold of Divine Love with the Throne of
Love, the Divine Nature. For God is Love.</p>
            <p>I am now come to the period of my discourse upon the <hi>first part</hi> of my
Doctrine; <hi>The Love of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>second part is the Effusion,</hi> or <hi>pouring forth of Divine Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall express this to you by <hi>six Properties.</hi> The Love of God is poured
forth in <hi>Jesus Christ. 1. Freely. 2. Purely. 3. Plentifully. 4. Powerfully.
5. Essentially. 6. Eternally.</hi>
            </p>

7. 21. <hi>David</hi> is brought in, as a Type of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> He sitteth in the
Temple be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore the Lord, when he was setled in his Kingdom, and at the
height of his Kingly Glory. Thus Jesus Christ sitteth upon his Throne in the
highest Heavens before his Father. He discourseth to his Father of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of his Fathers Love, and his own Glory. <hi>What is my Fathers House, that
thou hast brought me hitherto? v.</hi> 18. I was a Man, a poor Creature, a Worm
of the Earth, Earthy, as the Dust of the Earth, as low, as the neathermost
parts of the Earth, as low, and naked, as the first principle of the first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when the Earth was empty, and void, when darkness covered the face of
it: This was my Fathers House. Yet thou hast brought me hitherto, thou hast
brought me to thy right Hand, far above all Principalities, and Powers, all
Heavens to thy Throne. Thou hast given me a new Name above every Name,
a Name, that eminently comprehendeth all Names in it; a Name, that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
transcendeth all Names. Thus Love is poured forth in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="382" facs="tcp:49838:206"/>
               <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> goeth on in the Person of <hi>David. And this was yet a small
thing in thy sight; O Lord God; thou hast spoken of thy Servants House for a
great while to come, v.</hi> 19. This, O my Father, which thou hast wrought so
wonderfully; these mighty Works, these Miracles of Divine Love, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in my Person seem a small thing to thee. Thou hast spoken of my House,
my Church, my Members, my Seed to reign with me in the same Kingdom
of Glory to Eternity.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> raiseth this Love to the highest point of Admiration, to
a state of transcendency above the capacity, and comprehension of all Humane
Hearts, of all Created understandings. Is this the manner of Man, O Lord
God! Is there any thing among Men, in the compass of the Creation, to
which this Love can be likened, or with which it can be compared? Is there
any where any Image, Figure, or Resemblance of such a design, such a work
of Love, and Glory?</p>
            <p>Thus Love is poured forth in the Person of the Lord Jesus, See now, how
freely it is poured forth. <hi>According to thine own heart hast thou done all this,
v.</hi> 21. Indeed he bringeth in first; <hi>For thy Words sake;</hi> for thy Promise; for
thy Sons sake, thine Eternal Word, thine Essential Image, the Ground of thy
Promise; the Subject of thy Love, and Design; the Pattern, and Model of
thy Work. But this word springeth from that Root, to which all is ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
referred; the Heart of God; <hi>According to thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> own Heart hast thou
done all this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Heart of God is the Fountain of living Loves, which springeth up
<hi>freely</hi> of its own accord to Eternal Joys, and Glories in the Person of Christ.</p>
            <p>The Love of God in Christ receiveth its Beginning, Force, Form, Fashion,
and Finishing from the Heart of the Father. <hi>All the Works of God</hi> are said
in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to have been <hi>Finished from the Beginning of the
World.</hi> All the Loves of God, all the Works of Divine Love manifested, and
wrought in the Blessed Person of our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> were finished from Eternity
in the heart of his Father.</p>
            <p>All Tides are from the Aestuation of the Sea. The Sea boyling up from its
Bottom, as it riseth, and dilateth itself, poureth forth floods of Waters into all
Rivers which run along in the Bosom of the Earth. The Heart of God is the
great Sea of Love. This from its own Divine Heart, Height, and Fulness filleth
all Spirits with its Heavenly Floods in the Bosom of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>James</hi> 1. 5. God is said to <hi>give to all men liberally, and to upbraid none.</hi> Love
is implyed in the gift; Freedom in the liberality, and gentleness without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.
The Person of <hi>Christ</hi> is signified in the universality; <hi>All Men.</hi> Christ
is one among the rest of Men, <hi>Christ</hi> is the Fulness of Mankind. He took not
upon him the Person, but the nature of man, unrestrained to any particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
His Humane Nature was not a Branch, or an Apple, but the Apple-Tree.</p>
            <p>There are two expressions, which St. <hi>James</hi> maketh use of here to set forth
the Freedom of Divine Love in the effusions of it.</p>
            <p>1. He giveth <hi>Liberally.</hi> The Word in Greek is <hi>Simply,</hi> without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve;
without any Division of the Heart. Simplicity is Unity; The Intent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Mind upon One Thing. The heart of God, All the Thoughts of
his heart, All the Powers of the Godhead, All the Divine Attributes are united,
and intended upon This One Thing alone; Love poured forth on the Person
of the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Simplicity is without Alteration, or Composition. The heart of God is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
in this, Natural, unchangeable. This is the One Thing, the Onely Thing
of God's heart. This is the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. Upbraiding none To upbraid, is to object some Evil, as an Argument

Incests, Treasons, Witchcrafts, Murthers, Idolatries, Rebellious Blaspemies,
Horrid Profanenesses, Apostasies, Spiritual wickednesses in Heavenly, Angelical,

when he is Baptized into that publick Ministry, in which he professedly bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Sins of all the World before Men and Angels, in which he beareth
the Person of the greatest Sinners, that ever were in the open Eye of Heaven;
Heaven openeth upon him, the God-Head descendeth upon him visibly in a
living Form of Love, in the Form of a Dove; a voice cometh to him from
the Father: <hi>This is my Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>Love thinketh no Evil. Solomon</hi> saith; <hi>Love covereth All

The First Matter is said by learned men to be a Deep of Emptiness, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:49838:208"/>
Darkness, a meer Possibility, a Pure Passiveness to all Forms of Things. Such
Matter, such a Subject is every Soul to the Divine Love in Christ. Every Soul
is in itself a great Deep covered with the Blackness of a Darkness. But it is to
This Love a meer Possibility, a Pure Passiveness. It cannot actuate itself to a
Complyance, or a Resistance. Love cometh to it, as its Form, infuseth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into it, penetrateth thorow the whole Substance of it, filleth it in every
Part. Love reigneth Powerfully over it, reigneth gloriously in it; maketh it a
Kingdom of Love; maketh it a Lovely Queen to itself standing at its own right
hand, reigning, and ruling together with itself in this New Kingdom of Love.</p>
            <p>Rom. 5. 20. <hi>Where Sin abounded, there Grace hath abounded much more Seas,</hi>
and rivers have their High-Water Marks. Thus far their Waters come,
when they are highest, but no further. The Sea of Divine Love in the Bosom
of Christ hath no High-Water Mark, no Bound; Thus far Love shall flow,
thus high its pure and sweet Waves shall rise, to wash, to make white, to
make new, to overflow, Sinners of such Circumstances; But beyond this no
Love shall pass, to Sins of such aggravations, of so deep, and foul a Dye; to
Sins against so much Light, so much Love; to Sins so often repeated after so
many new Repentances, new Resolutions; to Sins so black, so bloody, No;
The Love of God is without Distinction; to all Sins, and over all Sinners in
Jesus Christ. If It maketh any Difference; It floweth first, It riseth highest
there, where Sin hath most abounded; that there It may be most Glorified.
The Love of God in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> maketh the greatest Sinners its Patterns to
all the World of Men, and Angels; Its Master-pieces to Eternity.</p>
            <p>1 Tim. 1. 15. <hi>God had mercy on me the Chiefest of Sinners; that I might
be an Ensample to all that shall believe in ages to come;</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The holy
Apostle doth not speak vainly, when he calleth himself <hi>The Chief of Sinners</hi>
he speaketh the truth in the Holy Ghost, and lyeth not. He setteth himself,
as a Light on a high Watch-Tower, to all thorow all ages, that shall fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
upon Seas of Lust, in a dark Night of Ignorance, and Unbelief, exposed to
Storms of Wrath. He inviteth them to make thither, there they shall be
safe, they shall find rest, they shall find a Heven of Divine Love in the Bosom
of <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> defended by the Rocks of Eternity, the Divine Attributes
from every wind.</p>
            <p>No Vessel will fear want of water there, where it seeth the greatest Ship of
the greatest burthen, deepest loaden which draweth the greatest depth of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to sail safely. St. <hi>Paul</hi> being dead yet speaketh to the greatest Sinners
in every age after this manner. Behold a Sea of Love, a Channel of Love the
Love of God poured forth in the Bosom of <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> My self the greatest
Sinner deepest loaden with Sin, and Guilt, who draw the greatest depth of
Love, have here found Love enough, unfathomable Love, on which I have
bin carried safely, triumphantly unto that Flourishing Land of Glory, where
now I feast continually with all Blessed Spirits in the midst of all Incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:49838:208"/>
Beauties, and Joyes. Let no sinner ever after me doubt to trust himself to this
Channel, to put himself upon this Sea of Love in the Bosom of the Lord Jesus.
Thus the Love of God poureth forth itself without Distinction in the Glorified
Person of our Blessed Saviour.</p>
            <p>2. The Father poureth forth his Love in <hi>Christ Indifferently,</hi> that is, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Love of the Father dependeth upon no Conditions between himself,
and his Son; the Father doth not say to <hi>Christ;</hi> I will pour forth my Love in
thee for Sinners; but upon this Condition, that thou make thy Soul an offering
for Sin; that thou satisfie my Justice and my Wrath; that thou take upon
thee to make them capable of my Love, suitable to me in Holiness, and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.
All, that the Lord Jesus hath done, or suffered is no Condition, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of the Father's Love. Love is the Sea: These are the many Springs,
by which it variously boileth up, the many Streams, and Windings, in which
it playeth with itself, as it runneth along in this Earthly Image, until it return
into the Sea, itself again, from whence it came.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> testifieth; <hi>The Words, which I speak, are not mine, but the
Father's. He doth the Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the First, the Supreme Love itself, which shut up itself in Flesh, which
was made Flesh; It is That Love, which weepeth bleedeth, dyeth; which
hangeth upon the Cross, lieth in the Grave. It is that Love, which riseth again,
maketh itself a Spirit, ascendeth up on high, taketh to itself Its First, and
great Glory. It is that Love, which, as a Spirit, cometh to thee Invisibly,
by day, and by Night; which is now with thee Invisibly, wooing thee in all
Forms, in Its Blood, in Its Beauties, by all means working itself into thine
heart. It is The Love of the Father, That Love, which is the Onely Father,
which doth all the Works, which speaketh all the Words in the Person of the
Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the same Gold which is stampt in several pieces, with several Images,
to make Crowns Angels, Twenty shilling Pieces. Coin, and Currant Money
for Traffick. The Incarnation, Active Obedience, Sufferings, Resurrection, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession
of the Lord Jesus; his Presence, his Powers, his Operations in the
Spirit are All The same Gold, The same Divine Love in several Forms bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
several Figures, for Traffick, and Commerce between God, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
When thou presentest to God the Blood, the Glory, the Intercession, the
Spiritual Operations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Graces of the Lord Jesus; thou settest before him, his
Love himself in various Manners, in various Mysteries. The Onely Coin, the
Onely Currant Money, the Onely Means of Commerce in the Kingdom of
Heaven, is Love, the First Supreme, Eternal Love, the Gold of Eternity, the
most high, and most Glorious Unity in all varieties, stampt with all Figures.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Father in giving his Love maketh no Condition with Sinners.</hi> He doth
not say; I give thee my Love for that Sinner upon Condition that he be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:49838:209"/>
that he accept of my Love, that he believe in thee. The Gospel is a
Covenant of Grace. The Covenant is All Love. The Covenant is Compleat
in the Person of Christ, who is The Divine Love, Eternal Love in a Divine,
Infinite, Eternal Person. <hi>I have given him,</hi> saith the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Esa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All Preparations, Qualifications, Acceptations are not Conditions of This
Love, but Infallible Consequents; not Causes, <hi>without which</hi> the Covenant
hath no Force; but Irresistible, Immutable Effects of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Grace ye are saved: Ephes.</hi> 2. The whole Work of our Salvation from
the Begining to the End, from the first Design in Eternity to the last Act in
Eternity is Pure Love.</p>
            <p>Divine Love shineth in upon a Dark Spirit, Enlightneth, Awakneth, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
it by Its own Heavenly Brightness. Divine Love burneth up, flameth
in a Defiled, Dead heart, raiseth a Divine Life, and Sense in it, melteth it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth
its Dross, maketh it new.</p>
            <p>The Love of the Father in the Bosom of the Lord Jesus is the Golden Mine,
out of which a Saint is first taken: the Flaming Mint, where he is Melted,
refined, made pure Gold, and stamp't with the Divine Image.</p>
            <p>Rev. 1. 5. 6. <hi>He,</hi> saith St <hi>John</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jesus, hath loved us, and washed
us in his own blood, and made us Kings, and Priests to God his Father.</hi> The
Love of the Father in the heart of Christ is our onely Fountain. All the Blood,
which streameth from the Wounds of Christ to wash us, runneth down from
this Fountain. This Love is the Costly Ointment running down upon all our
Persons, anointing us for Priests, and Kings.</p>
            <p>Poor Soul, which lyest in thy Sins, which lyest a Slave in Chains, at the
bottom of a Dark, Deep, and Miry Dungeon. The Love of the Father in the
Person of the Lord Jesus cometh to thee; It taketh thee into itself, as a Bath
of most pretious Blood, in which It cleanseth thee from all thy filth, cherisheth
all thy parts bringeth thee to thy self, to a Divine Beauty, to a Divine Warmth

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This Love is free. It seeketh not, but bringeth Loveliness along with
it. This Love is itself The Wedding-Garment, and the Marriage-Crown. This
Feast, as thou eatest, giveth thee strength, Beauty, and a Right to it. This
Feast of Love maketh Its Guest. This Marriage of Love maketh a
Bride.</p>

Love?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Canst thou not part with a single, dying Flower in thy hand for a
Root of Flowers to set in thine heart, in thy Garden? The Love of God is The
Root of all Precious and Pleasant Things in Eternity.</p>
            <p>Canst thou not part with a Shadow for the Substance, a Picture for the Life, a
Counterfeit for the Truth, a glass Diamond, or Pearl, for a right Diamond, the
true Pearl? All thy Pleasant Things here are Shadows, Pictures, counterfeits;
This Love is All Pleasantnesses, all Preciousnesses in their Substance, Life, Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. I am weak. I shall dishonour This Love; I shall be disloyal to It. I
shall return to my Lusts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> This Love requireth no Qualifications, but worketh all. Give up thy
self to be the Creature of This Love. This Love will make Thee a Heavenly
Bride to itself out of Nothing, out of Contrariety, Enmity, This Love will be
both a new, a Divine Creation of Thee; and a Continual Preservation. This
Preservation shall be a Continued Creation of Love. Resign thy self to This
Love, which is the onely Fountain of Life, and of all Loveliness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 2. Love again. Who planteth a Vine, and drinketh not of the Wine?
The Father planteth Jesus Christ, his Love, his Vine in thy Soul. Let him drink
of the Wine of thy Loves. Love thy God with the same Freedom, Simplicity,
and Sweetness, with the Same Naturalness, Nakedness, and Force, with which
he loveth Thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use.</hi> 3. Love one another, as God loveth you. Pour forth all your Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bosom of <hi>Christ.</hi> There let it run into the Bosom of every Saint, of
every Creature. There love one another without Distinction, without Condition,
Freely receive one another into, embrace one another in the Riches of the
Grace, and Glory of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as the Father receiveth, and embraceth you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 4. Abide in the Love of the Father.</p>
            <p>1. Abide in the Father's Love by Faith in the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> The Glorified
Person of Christ is the Land of Life, the Land of Love; the Love of the
Father is the Sweetness, and Fatness of this Land. Faith is the root of thy
Soul in this Pleasant Land. By Faith thy Soul is vitally fixed in this
Divine Soil, in the midst of all the Sweetnesses, and Pretious Sap of Divine
Love. By Faith thou drawest the rich heart of this Glorious Earth the Love
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:49838:210"/>
of The Father to thy self. Thou feedest upon It, nourishest thy self by It, and
growest up to an Entire Tree of Love.</p>
            <p>2. Abide in this Love by holiness. Holiness is the lovely Fruit, which spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up out of the Love of the Father, and is Its Food. Holiness, is the Purity
of the Spirit, by which the flame of heavenly Love liveth, and spreaded itself
there. Holiness is the Spiritual Chastity of the Soul to her heavenly Bridegroom.</p>
            <p>3. Abide in the Father's Love by keeping his Commandments. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Father are Beams of Love, which he shooteth into our Bosoms.
Obedience to them is the Reception of these Beams, and the Reflection of them
back again into the Bosom of God.</p>
            <p>Obedience is the Activity of Divine Love enlarging itself freely in our
Souls. If it be contracted, or shut up, it goeth out.</p>
            <p>4. Abide in the Father's Love by the Peace of your Spirits. Peace of Spirit
is a Heavenly Calms, and Serenity, which freely receiveth, and preserveth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
the Beams, and Sunshine of Divine Love. Passions are Clouds and Storms,
which cut off, and darken the Beams of Love. The Spirit of Love resteth not
upon an Angry, or Melancholy Man.</p>
            <p>5. Abide in the Father's Love by Spiritual Joy. Joy is Love flaming. One
saith; that Laughter is the Dance of the Spirits, their freest Motion in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
and that the Light of the Heavens, is the Laughter of Angels. Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Joy is the Laughter of Divine Love, of the Eternal Spirit, which is Love,
in our Spirits. True Joy is Eternal Love, the Eternal Spirit in Its Freest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in Its fullest Harmony, and Complacency in our Spirits.</p>
            <p>6. Abide in the Love of the Father by Heavenliness. The Presence of God
in his Wrath is hell. The Presence of God in his Love is Heaven. Love is the
Sunshine of the Godhead sweetning, and guilding all things round about it
after a Divine Manner; as this Sun doth these Skies. So far, as thou abidest in
a Heavenly Image of Things, where every Object is covered with an Immortal
Pleasantness, and Glory; thou abidest in the Love of God.</p>
            <p>7. Abide in the Father's Love by Spirituality. Love is an Union. The highest
Love is the highest Unity, the Unity of the highest Spirit. In the Unity of this
Spirit all things are Spirit of this Spirit. All Varieties in this Unity of the Spirit
are Spirits, Divine, Eternal Spirits of this Supreme Spirit, in this Supreme Spirit;
Supreme, Eternal Loves from the womb, in the Bosom of this Supreme Love.
Abide in This Palace of Love, The Unity of the Spirit. Let this be thine Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
habitation. Be continually here in the Sweet, and Blessed Society of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,
Pure, Eternal Spirits; Living, Immortal Loves. Behold, Converse
with all things within Thee, without Thee in these Forms. So shalt thou abide
in the Love of the Father, as It is poured forth in the Glorified Person of the
Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> So This Love shall guide Thee, as thou walkest, into Fields of Light,
and Divine Pleasures, into the Gardens of the Divine Nature. This Love shall
talk with Thee, when Thou wakest, as <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talked with <hi>Jesus
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:49838:210"/>
Christ,</hi> in the Transfiguration, of the Departure out of every other Image
of things, into this Paradise of Love flowing with all the Joyes of Life, and
Love in the heavenly Form of Christ. So This Love shall keep thee, when
thou sleepest, as a Rich Canopy of Divine Substance over thy head; as a Guard
of Immortal Sweetnesses round about Thee, as a heavenly Consort of Divine
Spirit, Divine Loves, by their Musical Harmony continuing, and crowning
thy sleep. I have done with the <hi>First Property</hi> of Divine Love, as It is poured
forth in <hi>Christ, Freedom.</hi> I come to the <hi>Second,</hi> which is Purity.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Property</hi> in the Effusion of Divine Love, <hi>Purity. The Love of God is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth in Jesus Christ Purely.</hi> The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is said to be, <hi>the Brightness of
the Glory of God; Hebr. 1. v.</hi> 2. Brightness is the Purest Light of Glory. The
Prime Glory in God is his Grace, his Love. He doth all <hi>for the Praise of the
Glory of his Grace, Ephes. 1. Jesus Christ</hi> in heaven, in thine heart, O Believer, is
the purest Stream, the richest Flood of Divine Love; the Love of the Divine
Nature in the Brightness of Its Glory.</p>
            <p>We are taught; that this Light of the Sun, which we enjoy here below,
is only a Shadow of that Light, which shineth in the Body of the Sun itself. The
Sun in its highest Lustre is the Shadow of an Angel. The Highest, and Brightest
Angel in his Purest Glories is no more, than a Shadow of our Glorified Jesus.
He alone is the Brightness of Divine Glory without any Shade; the Purity of
Divine Love without any Allay.</p>
            <p>Love is Loveliness in Motion. As fine Gold melted into a Pure, and shining
Stream: so is the Person of our Lord Jesus in Glory; the Godhead in the Purity
&amp; Perfection of all Its Lovelinesses melting itself into a most Pure &amp; Precious
Stream of Love, in which it runneth along, winding, turning, meeting, &amp; sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with itself from Bosom to Bosom, in the Father, the Son, and all the Saints.</p>
            <p>O Broken-hearted Sinner, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ittest in the Shadow of Death, who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest
in a Wilderness, where there is no water, ready to dye for thirst; open
thine Eyes, see this Pure Light of Divine Love, which shineth round about
Thee, in the midst of Thee; see this Pure Stream of Divine Love, which
runneth along before Thee, in that Wilderness thine heart; the Blessed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of thy Saviour, which is this Pure Light, this Pure Stream of Divine Love
which filleth All. Take in the Waters of this Stream; drink freely of it. Cast thy
self into this Stream; let it cover Thee; let it roul Thee along with it; sport
thy self in it.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>Two Arguments</hi> of the Pure Effusion of Divine Love in <hi>Christ;</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1 The heighth of Its Sweetness.</item>
                  <item>2 The Greatness of Its Virtue.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1 The Love of God in <hi>Christ</hi> sheweth Its <hi>Purity</hi> by <hi>The heighth of Its Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
The Purest things are Sweetest. The Love of God in <hi>Christ</hi> is the Rose
upon its Stalk, New-blown, in its Virgin-Freshness, and Sweetness. <hi>To be Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally-minded
is Death; to be Spiritually-minded is Life;</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul; Rom.</hi> 8.
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:49838:211"/>
Impurity, Carnality is the Death of Love; dulleth, embaseth, embittereth
it by Corrupting it. Purity, Spirituality is the Life of Love, heighteneth, and
immortaliseth all its Sweetnesses, all its Pleasures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Sweetness <hi>of the Love of God in</hi> Christ <hi>is made up of</hi> Three Parts; 1. The
Nearness of the Union; 2 The Firmness of the Union, 3 The Efficacy of the Union.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>The Nearness of the Union</hi> is the <hi>First Part</hi> of the <hi>Sweetness</hi> in the Love
of God poured forth in the Glorified Person of our Saviour. Love is an Union.
Where Love is Sweetest; the Love-Union is Nearest. The Love of God in
<hi>Christ</hi> bindeth up God, <hi>Christ,</hi> all the Saints immediately in the most naked,
most warm Embraces of each other. It maketh them All up into One Beautiful
Body; It melteth them All into One Blessed-Spirit of Divine Love.</p>
            <p>The Bridegroom in the <hi>last</hi> of the <hi>Canticles</hi> expresseth his Love to his Bride
after this manner: <hi>If she be a Door, we will inclose her with Cedar.</hi> Cedar Wood
is Eminent for three Things: It is sweet, Beautiful, Incorruptible. Blessed art
Thou, O Believer, the meanest of all Believers; who art a Door onely in this
heavenly Temple, <hi>Christ</hi> risen from the Dead; a Door, by which the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Godhead go in, and out between the Visible, and Invisible World.
Thy <hi>Jesus</hi> by the Immediate Embraces of Divine Love incloseth, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth
thy Person entirely with the Sweetness, Beauty, Immortality of his own
Glorified Person.</p>
            <p>The Soul in the Bosom of Christ lieth, as a Pleasant Island in a Sea of Love.
The Sea bringeth to an Island Pleasure by its prospect, and by sayling upon
it; Safety by inclosing it; Riches by Traffick unto all parts. Thus thou,
O Saint, art seated in the midst of a vast Ocean of heavenly Love. This Oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an
of Love is thy Prospect on every side. Which way soever thou lockest, thou
seest Waves of Love rolling, and tumbling one upon the neck of another;
sometimes rising up, as high, as heaven, sometimes again falling, as low as He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l.
All Storms are The Workings of this Lovely Sea of Love, and Delightful
Entertainments to Thee, thou lanchest forth and sailest round about thy
Island, which is thy self, upon this Sea of Love. These are thy Pleasures.</p>
            <p>How safe art thou? How great, and impregnable is thy Strength? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can come to thee but by a Sea of Love, Divine, Almighty, Eternal Love.
Thou art inaccessible, but this way, by the Sea of Love. No vessels can pass
upon this Sea, nothing can pass thorow it, but Divine Forms of Love; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Angels, and Ministers of Love. Whatever other Form of things attempteth,
This Blessed Ocean of the Father's Love poureth forth in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by it, and never seen more.</p>
            <p>Thou hast Tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ick, and Commerce by this Sea of Love with all things holy,
heavenly, Beautiful, and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>essed every where; with all Lands of Life, and Joy.
Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, thoughts and Affections into all Parts. Thou
bringest home all the Precious, and Pleasant things of Heaven, and Earth;
of Time, and Eternity: of God, and the Creature. Thou hast a Love-Union,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:49838:211"/>
and by this Love-Union, a Communion of Love with all the Treasures of the
Godhead in the Sun, and in the Moon; in the Heavens above, and the Deep,
which lieth below.</p>
            <p>This is the Purity, the Sweetness of the Father's Love in <hi>Christ;</hi> the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Love-Union.</p>
            <p>2. The Sweetness of the Love of God in <hi>Christ</hi> sheweth itself in the
<hi>Firmness of the Union.</hi> What the Spouse of <hi>Christ</hi> saith of her self in the <hi>Canticles,</hi>
that is the Language of this Love to the Soul in <hi>Jesus Christ; I took hold of him,
I will not let him go.</hi> The Love of the Father hath taken hold of Thee, &amp; will
never let Thee go. St. <hi>Paul;</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>v.</hi> 35. maketh a Challenge; What shall
separate us from the Love of Christ? Affliction? Danger? Sword? the Love-Union
between God, and the Soul in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is so close, so fast; that the
Point of the sharpest Sword cannot pierce between them; the subtilest Flame
cannot divide between them. If it wound, or burn one, it must wound, and
burn the other also. There is no Vein of Blood in the Body of Man, which
hath not running along beneath it an Artery, a Vein of Spirits to preserve the
Warmth, Motion, and Life of the Blood. There is no Vein of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
in the whole Life of a Saint; there is no Vein of Life or Death in the
whole Person of a Saint, which hath not a Vein of Divine Love running
along inseparably with it, to sweeten it, to give a Spiritual, a heavenly Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
of Life, Joy, and Glory to it.</p>
            <p>To me to live is Christ, to dye is <hi>Gain;</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> Philip 1. <hi>v.</hi> 21. There
is nothing so Dividing, as Death. The Life of a Man is the Union between
Soul, and Body. Death dissolveth this Union. The Life of a Saint is the Love.
Union between his God, and Spirit in <hi>Christ,</hi> who is the Glorious head, and
the Golden knot of this Union. Death maketh this Love-Union faster, and
sweeter; more close, more clear, more compleat. D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath is a Gain here.</p>
            <p>The Death of a Saint is like the Tabernacle in the Wilderness. Without
was a course Tent of <hi>Badgers</hi> Skin, exposed to the Injuries of all Weathers.
This was seen by the Common Eye. But this was not the Tabernacle. This
was onely the Tent, the Covering upon the Tabernacle. The Tabernacle
within, as it appeared to the Priest's Eye, which entred into it, was Silk,
Silver, Gold, and Precious Stone; Fine Linnen, Scarlet, Crimson, Sky-Colour;
Cherubims richly wrought. Be not deceived. That is not the Death of a Saint,
That is not a Saint in Death, which appeareth outwardly to the Eye of Sense,
so affrightful, so mournful, so dark, so deformed, so Dividing from all the
Joyes of Life: No. This is the Covering onely upon Death, to hide the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Mystery from common Eyes.</p>
            <p>That, which is within, which presenteth itself all along to the Eye of a
Saint, that entreth into this Death is indeed a Tabernacle of Immortal, of
Divine Love with all rich, and pleasant Appearances wonderfully heightened;
The Love-Union between God, and the Soul in Christ opening itself, taking
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:49838:212"/>
the Soul entirely into itself, as into the true Heavens, where all things, which
are seen are the highest Forms of Beauty in the highest Lights of Divine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
all things, that are heard, tasted or felt, the highest Joyes of the Divine
Life with the most heightned Sweetnesses of Divine Love.</p>
            <p>3 The Sweetness of Divine Love is manifested in its <hi>Efficacy, in its
Sweetning Operations,</hi> as it is poured forth in the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith;
<hi>Philip: 3. l. We have our Conversation in Heaven, from whence we look for
the Lord Jesus, who shall change these Vile Bodies (these Bodies of our humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and make them like his own Glorious Body, according to that Power, by
which he is able to subdue all things to himself.</hi> As the Flowers put forth, unfold

               </gap>ies send forth their several Sweetnesses to the Sun: so do all the
Excellencies, Joyes and Glories of the Godhead display themselves to the
Divine Love. God in the Presence of his Love is the highest, the Truest H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
This is the Heaven, which containeth, and hideth <hi>Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ</hi>
cometh forth from this Heaven, as a Bridegroom from his Chamber he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth in this Heaven, with this Heaven round about him; he maketh this
Heaven, every where, as he cometh forth; as the Sun maketh a Glorious Sky.
He boweth this Heaven, and cometh down upon It into the broken heart. To
this broken heart he changeth the vilest, the Bitterest Image of things, the Body
of its humiliation, the Body of this Darkness, and Death, in which it dwelleth
here into the Likeness of his own most Glorious Body, the Body of the highest
Heaven in its Brightness; the Pure, and clear Body of Divine Love. This Love
of the Father is that <hi>Power, by which our Jesus subdueth all things to himself,</hi>
that is, to the Brightness, and Sweetness of the Glory of this Love; to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,
to the Naked Image of this Love in its own Divine Substance, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

own most Lovely Person. This is the transfiguring Efficacy of the Love of
the God-Head poured forth in the Glorious Person of Christ, and making for
him a Body of Divine Loves above all Heavens.</p>
            <p>Rom. 8. 28, 29. St. <hi>Paul</hi> triumpheth after this manner: <hi>I am perswaded, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

things to come; nor heighth, nor Depth; nor any other Creature shall be able to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
us from the Love of God, which is in Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> The Love of
God in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> lineth, covereth all things transubstantiateth all things into
the same Divine Love. St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth the nearest things to us, the most
intimate, the most Potent, the most Penetrating, the most Universal, the most
comprehending, the most Transforming; Death, Life, Angels, things Present,
to come, Depth, Heigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h. What cometh nearer, what toucheth every Point of
our whole Substance, and Being, than Death, Life, Angels? What more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
to our hearts, and Spirits? If none of these can come between the Love
of God in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and our Persons: then all these by the Touch of this
Love must be Tinctured, and changed into new Forms, into Essences of
Love.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="395" facs="tcp:49838:212"/>
As Sugar is dissolved in a Glass of Wine; so Death Life, Angels, things

               </gap>nt, things to come, heighths, Depths, every other Creature in this Golden
Cup of Divine Love, the Glorified Person of Christ, is dissolved into Love,
becometh a Rich Love-Cordial to a fainting Spirit, making it to dance, and
sing for Joy, when it was intended a deadly Poyson to it. The holy Apostle had
said upon this Ground a little before: <hi>In all these things, Sword, Famine, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
wee are more, than Conquerours.</hi> It is plain, how we are <hi>Conquerours.</hi>
Captivity is carried Cuptive. Those Forms, and Powers of Darkness, of Death,
which thought to captivate us, are themselves Captives to Eternal Life, and
Love in the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> As Saul among the Prophets: so the Bitterest, the
Blackest things, which assault the Spirit of a Saint, encompassed with this Love
of the Father poured forth in Christ, uncloath themselves, and put on Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Shapes of Love, sing songs of Love, breath forth from every part of them
the most Delightful Sweetness of Divine Love.</p>
            <p>Thus this Love maketh us Conquerours. But what meaneth this; to be
more, than Conquerours? Is there a Joy, or Glory above this of a Conquerour?
Grace coming into Glory; Love Reigning after Suffering?</p>
            <p>Is there any thing sweeter, any thing greater, than this Victory of
Love?</p>
            <p>Yes. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith; when he was caught up into the Third heavens, into
the Paradise there, he heard Words, which it is impossible to utter. This is
<hi>The Paradise in the Third Heavens,</hi> the Love of God in the Glorified Person
of <hi>Christ.</hi> This Love transformeth every thing, every Creature to this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Paradise. Those blessed Souls, which by believing enter into this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
hear Words of Love, Words of Joy, Words of Pleasure, of Glory from
this Love, which it is impossible to utter, which are too sweet, too high, too
ravishing to be exprest.</p>
            <p>A holy Soul in This Paradise of Love feeleth a Joy far beyond that of
Marriage, of Conquest, of Reigning, of Children, of any thing named in this
World, or in that, which is to come.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Sweetness</hi> of Divine Love expresseth itself in its Sweet <hi>Efficacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Purity</hi> of Divine Love in Christ is manifest in its <hi>Sweetness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Love of God in Christ is most Pure, because it hath the greatest Virtue.</hi>
Our Divines express hell after this manner. All Diseases, Pains, Griefs here are
Evils by a Tincture onely of Divine Wrath, a little Drop of Divine Wrath
mingling itself with them. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Evil of all Diseases, Pains, and Griefs abstracted from them, and heightned
to the utmost. So <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> bare all our Infirmities, and took our Griefs;
though he was never sick.</p>
            <p>On the Contrary, all the Good, all the Joyes in the Creature are a Weak
Tincture of Divine Love. The Shadow of St. <hi>Peter</hi> as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Love of God is poured forth <hi>Purely</hi> in the Person of <hi>Christ.</hi> There
Love is a Substance, no Accident. There Love is Infinite, being allayed, or

            <p>The Work, for which <hi>Christ</hi> came, is a Work of Love, of Light, of Life;
not a Work of Wrath, and Death. <hi>Jesus Christ came to destroy the Works of
the Devil.</hi> The Devil Is a Lyar, and a Murtherer from the Beginning. He is
the Serpent, the Seed of Enmity. The Deceit of Sin, Death, Wrath are the
Devil's Work. <hi>Jesus</hi> cometh full of Grace, and Truth; like the Sun full of

and for ever; even in that Day, when he was made Flesh in his humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
this Spirit carrieth Liberty along with It; as the Sun doth the Light of

            <p>This Liberty of the Spirit answereth to that Removal of the Vail in the

Supreme Spirit shall shine entirely in the whole Image of things, in the whole
heart, in every Part, in every Point of Both.</p>
            <p>The Close of all is the Blessed Effect of the Removal of the Vail, of the
Free, and full Appearance of this Spirit, the Lord <hi>Jesus;</hi> A Liberty of Sight;
A Liberty of Growth; a Liberty of Union, and Divine Communion. A Saint

seeth this Glory in the Unity of the same Spirit, as in a Looking-Glass;
where Face answereth Face, where one is seen, as the Dear Image, and Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the other. A Saint in the same moment seeth, and is changed into
the Image which he seeth, as by one Spirit at once working Both. The Lord,
the same Spirit in its Unity is the Root, the Eye, the Life, the Light, the
Looking-Glass, the Glorious Face in the Looking-Glass to a Saint. Where this
Spirit is, there is Liberty in that Heart. The Vail is taken off from it, when
the Spirit existeth, and appeareth in it. There the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and a Saint
see each other; grow up together, in one Glory. <hi>We all, with open face, as in

            <p>The Firmament is not set so thick with Stars; as the Whole Earth, the

are so many Suns of Love to the Flowers, the Wheat, the Gold, the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,

            <p>2. <hi>Application. Fear to look with a Vailed Heart upon the Vailed Face of
the Lord Jesus.</hi> If thou seest the Shadow, the Letter of the Gospel; if thou
seest the Vail, the Flesh of Christ; if thou seest not to the End of these, as
things to be done away, if thou seest not thorow these, beyond these, the
Lord, the Spirit, which is the Heavenly Body, and Substance to the Shadow;
the Naked Face, the Naked, Unchangeable, Eternal Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Vail: it is not <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> but <hi>Moses,</hi> in whom thou trustest. Thou
art not in the Arms of a Lovely, pleasant Bridegroom; but at the feet of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Judge.</p>
            <p>This is the Law from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which engendreth bondage, which
trembleth, and shaketh for fear, where Thunders roar, and Lightnings fly
abroad from the midst of a thick Darkness. This is not the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> full of
Grace, that Perfect Love, which casteth out fear; the Perfection of Beauty,
on Mount Sion; which standeth firm for ever; which may be touched, kissed,
and embraced. Take heed to thy self, O Temporary Believer; Thou Jew,
thou <hi>Christian</hi> outwardly, in the Letter onely. This is not the <hi>Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
on which thou lookest; but the Cloud, which covereth the Sun. If the
Eye of thy Spirit stay here, and pierce no further: out of this Cloud will
come down upon thy head, a tempest, a Whirlwind, and Flames of Fire.
The Vail is upon your Hearts, while the Gospel is read, even to this day.</p>

3 <hi>Application Blessed art thou, who lookest with a Naked Heart upon the
Naked Person of Christ.</hi> He who is fixed in the Letter, the Outward Form, the
Flesh of the Eternal Word, is One of the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
at the Foot of the Mountain, having in their Eye the Outside onely of
things. These saw nothing, but the Blackness of Darkness, and the Flashes of
Lightning; these heard nothing, but the dreadful claps of Thunder.</p>
            <p>He, who ascendeth, and entreth into the Truth the Spirit, is with <hi>Moses,</hi>
within, upon the Top of the Mount. He talketh with God face to face, as a man
talketh with his Friend. He seeth the Divine Light, and Calm of Eternity in the
naked Person of the Lord Jesus. He receiveth the Language of Divine Love, the
Musick of Eternity, with kisses of Love, immediately, from the Lips of the
Lord Jesus. He feeleth the Fountain of Life, &amp; all Joys flowing from the Heart
of the Lord Jesus, running nakedly thorow his whole Body, and Spirit; being a
better Feast, than that of all meats, and Drinks; filling him with Spirit, and
pleasantness; cloathing him with a fresh Lustre, Beauty in a more excellent way.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> saith of himself in the Gospel; <hi>I have a Baptism to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
with, and how am I streightned, till it be over.</hi> The Loves, the Lovelines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
the Divine Life, the Delights, the Glories, the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> all the Treasures
of the Eternal Word are streightned in the flesh of <hi>Christ;</hi> as the Beauties, and
Sweetnesses of a Flower; the Fruits of a Tree are shut up, and imprisoned
in the Seed. When the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> by Death is baptised into a Divine Form
and Glory, when he cometh forth, as A Spirit, as the Eternal Spirit having
married the Humane Nature into One Heavenly Form, and Spirit, with itself:
Now all the Treasures of Righteousness, Life, Immortality, Love, Joy; all
the Treasures of the God-Head display themselves over the whole Person of
Christ, entirely, nakedly, richly, to the Height of all their Beauties, and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
as Flowers full-blown in Spring; as Fruit-trees laden with ripe fruit
in Autumn.</p>
            <p>Who now can express the Joys, when a Naked Heart meeteth with its
Naked Jesus? when both have cast off their Vails; One from his Face; The
other from his Heart. It is the same Blessed hand of the Eternal Spirit, which
taketh off the Vails, from Both, dropping Myrrhe, a heavenly Sweetness, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Immortality, as It taketh them off.</p>
            <p>The Reflection of the Face of God upon the Face of <hi>Moses</hi> on the Mount
cast a Divine Lustre, and Beauty, which remained upon it.</p>
            <p>He came down into the midst of the People, bringing a Heaven in his
Face along with him. But they could not bear the Brightness of this Naked
Beauty. He therefore casteth a Vail upon his Face. So they remain in Darkness,
their Minds are blinded; until Wrath cometh upon them to the uttermost.</p>
            <p>This is an Example unto us; upon whom the Ends of all Fore-going
Times, and Actions are come. Behold the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is gone up to the top
of the Mount. He is ascended. He is Glorified with the Father, with that Glory,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:49838:216"/>
which he had with the Father before the World was. As a Spirit he cometh
down again to us in the Shining Form of this Spiritual, Uncreated, Eternal
Glory.</p>
            <p>Wo to you, who cannot bear the Brightness of this Appearance, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
look stedfastly upon the Naked Face, the Naked Form of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi>
this Spirit. To you he casteth a Vail over his Face; and as he casteth a Vail
over his own Face; he casteth a Vail over your Hearts. To you now he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

Wings; Overspreading you with his warm, and Naked Beauties; Covering
your Deformities; Curing your Maladies; Infusing new Cordials of Immortal
Life, and Joy into your Hearts; Hatching you to Spirituality; raising you
upon Silver Wings, and Golden Feathers to Heavenly Flights with himself.</p>
            <p>To you he cometh Enlightning, enlivening, Transforming, Glorifying,
Gathering you up into One Spirit, One Glory with himself.</p>
            <p>Where this Spirit, the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is, there is Liberty of beholding, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> nakedly, immediately, entirely, eternally; without any
chain, clog, cloud, interposal, or interruption. There is Liberty of growing
up into a Spirit out of All the Vails of Flesh: into One Spirit with him. O
the Joys of a Naked Heart, when it meeteth with its Naked Saviour.</p>
            <p>But, as it was with the Painter, who called to remove the Vail, that he
might see the Picture; when their was a Vail onely painted there. The Vail
was all the Picture: so is it with the hypocrite, with the Temporary Believer.
His Jesus, his Heaven is a Vail onely; a Vail, like that of the Tabernacle,
finely wrought with Pictures of Angels, of Heaven, of Jesus; but Keeping
him for ever from the Face, the Bosom of Jesus the society of Angels, the Joys
of Heaven, in the Outermost Darkness. His hope is a Spiders Web. The
Poison of Death, and Hell are bred there.</p>
            <p>I hear a Voice frequently in my Spirit saying to me; Cry. What shall I
cry?</p>
            <p>1. Cry; There was an Ark in which <hi>Noah,</hi> and his Family were safe
from the Flood, which drowned the World. The onely Ark in which <hi>Noah,</hi>
the Believer, the Child of Rest shall be safe from the Flames, which are now
ready to devour the World, is the Naked Person of Christ in the Invisibility,
and Spirituality of his Divine, <hi>Eternal</hi> Form.</p>
            <p>2. Cry; The Sound, and noise of the Hammers framing the Ark for <hi>Noah,</hi>
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:49838:216"/>
preached the Righteousness of God, the Ruin of the World, very near. The
Sound, and noise of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> the Spirit of Life, the Spirit of Love, in
his Naked Person, in his Naked Loves, and Lovelinesses growing up, forming
himself in the Spirits of his Saints preaches now a Deluge of Destruction,
Death, and Hell at the Door, ready to enter in; The Rest, and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God in his Bosom alone, the Rest of God in his Loves; the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God in his Loveliness.</p>
            <p>3. Cry; As it was in the Days of <hi>Noah;</hi> so it will be now. The whole
World will go on to eat, and Drink, to marry, and give in Marriage; to mock
at this Preparation of an Ark; at these Discourses of, these Endeavours for the
Spiritual Person of Christ in the Heavenly Image: for the Revelation of him
in our Spirits; for the Retirement of our Persons into him. The whole World
will go on in Sensuality, and Carnality, mocking at the Lord, this Spirit, the
Ark; till the day that God open the Windows of Heaven from above, and
break up the great Deep of Hell from below to cover them with, and swallow
them up in Unquenchable Flames.</p>
            <p>They say; that <hi>Seth</hi> foreseeing Two Destructions of the World prepared
Two Pillars, upon which he engraved all Mysteries of Humane, and Divine
Knowledge; One of Marble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to endure the Flood; the other of Brick, to
continue in the Flames.</p>
            <p>St <hi>Peter</hi> speaking of the Flood and the Ark addeth; <hi>The Like Figure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
now saveth us, Baptism; not the washing away of the filth of the Flesh, but
the Answer of a Good Conscience by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> counselleth the last Church, <hi>Laodicea, to buy of him Gold
tried in the Fire.</hi> Gold tried in the Fire no more loseth any thing, or receiveth
any harm in the Fire; but shineth more gloriously.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> risen from the Dead, and become a Spirit, the Fountain of
Life, is the Gold tried in the Fire of Death, and the Divine Wrath. An Ark of
Wood saved <hi>Noah</hi> from the Waters.</p>
            <p>Behold an Ark of pure Gold, a Spirit of Immortality, and Glory, which
shineth with greatest Glory in the midst of the Everlasting Burnings. This is
our <hi>Jesus,</hi> who saveth us from the Fire, which is already Kindled, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon the World, which will immediately raise itself to a Mighty, Irresistible
Flame. Blessed are you, who enter into this Ark of Gold, and shut your selves
up into It. Here you shall lie upon beds of Love, as in the Marriage-Chamber,
in the Bosom of your Bridegroom, encompassed with Songs of Joy; while
the Fire dreadfully devoureth all without, round about you. Then shall
Worldly Christians, Hypocrites, Temporary Believers, all who have lived in
the Lusts of the Flesh, or the Letter onely of the Gospel take hold of, climb
up upon the outside of the Ark, the outward Fleshly Form, and Appearances
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:49838:217"/>
of the Eternal Word, the Lord Jesus. Then shall they too late cry to be taken
into the Spirit, which alone is Truth, which alone hath Immortality. But
they shall be rejected. They shall lose their hold, drop off into the flames, and
perish there. I will conclude all with that Scripture; <hi>John, 14. v.</hi> 30. 31.
When <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> perceived, that the hour, and Power of Darkness were now
come upon him, he saith; <hi>The Prince of this World cometh; Arise, let us go hence.</hi>
Thus saith the same <hi>Jesus</hi> now in the Hearts of his Beloved Ones, to his
Spouse: The Prince of Darkness; The hour, and Power of Darkness, of dread,
of Destruction, of the Devouring Fire cometh; Arise, let us go hence; out of
the visible things of the Flesh, into the Invisibility of the Spirit; The Ark
of Pure Gold, Paved with Loves.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Property; Plenty.</hi> This is the Third Property in the Effusion of Divine
Love upon the Glorified Person of Christ. It is poured forth <hi>plentifully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will divide this Head by Streams flowing from it.</p>
            <p>1. The Fulness of all Love is poured forth in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>2. The Person of Christ is all Full of <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>The Fulness of all Love is poured forth in Jesus Christ.</hi> We read; <hi>Colos.
1. 19. It pleased the Father, that all Fulness should dwell in him;</hi> that is, in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ.</hi> All Fulness and so the Fulness of All Love had its Seat, its Bed in
the Bosom of our Saviour. But the Pleasure, the Will of the Father, which is
the Highest Pleasure, Pleasure in one, Substantial, most Perfect, Eternal Act, is
the Well Spring which sendeth forth this Plenitude of Divine Love into Christ.</p>
            <p>The Words lye so in Greek, that they may be properly rendred according
to the rules of Grammar after this manner: <hi>All Fulness was well pleased to dwell
in him.</hi> God is the Fulness, which filleth all in all. He alone is in any Place,
in any Spirit, in any Creature <hi>Repletive,</hi> so as to fill it. <hi>God is Love.</hi> God then
is the Fulness of all Love.</p>
            <p>Nothing attracteth, and draweth so powerfully, as Pleasure doth. God, who
is that Love, which is all Fulness, the Fulness of all; God, who is the Fulness
of all Love poureth forth himself to the Full, to the last drop, if we may so
speak of that Love, which hath neither First, nor last; Beginning, nor End;
in the Lord Jesus. For in Christ he poureth forth himself with Pleasure, which
is the highest of all Pleasures. The Effusion of Love is itself a Pleasure. Then
the Beautiful and Blessed Person of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> is the most pleasant Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
the most pleasant Seat, and Palace of Divine Love.</p>
            <p>This Fulness of Divine Love in <hi>Christ</hi> shooteth forth itself into Three
Branches;</p>
            <p>1. Love in all States. 2. Love of all Kinds. 3. Love in all Degrees.</p>
            <p>1. There is in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> flowing forth from the Father <hi>a Fulness of Love
in all States.</hi> There are <hi>Three States</hi> of Divine Love in our Blessed Saviour.
There is 1. <hi>Preventing Love; 2. Assisting Love; 3. Finishing Love.</hi> Divine
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:49838:217"/>
Love <hi>in Jesus Christ</hi> hath these Three States, and a glorious, transcendent, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant
Fulness in every State.</p>
            <p>1. There is in the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> poured forth from the Father <hi>A Fulness of
all Preventing Love. 2. Tim.</hi> 1. 9. St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us that <hi>God hath saved us,
not according to works, which we have done, but according to his own Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and Grace given us in Christ, before the World was.</hi> Before thou hadst any
thoughts of Love to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> before thou hadst any Being in This World,
before the World was; there was a Love from the Father in Jesus Christ to
Thee; to Thee, whoever thou art, that liftest up the Eye of thy Spirit, the Eye of
Faith, to see thy true Self, thine own Person in this Dwelling-Place, this Palace of
Divine Love, where thou hast bin hid. where thou hast had thine abode tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
all generations, from Eternity: <hi>Christ</hi> in the Glory of the Father, the
heart of the Father in <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Preventing Love well understood, removeth <hi>Two Objections</hi> out of
the way of many hearts to the Bosom of their Jesus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Broken-hearted Sinners, distressed Souls frequently plead thus
against themselves: We cannot think, that <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath any Love for us:
because we cannot believe his Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Hear, O broken-hearted Sinners, O Distressed Souls, Hear, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.
<hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath in himself from his Father the Fulness of all Preventing
Love. He beginneth to you in Love. He beginneth with you. He giveth you
Faith to believe his Love. <hi>To you it is given to believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Son of Man cometh, and giveth you an understanding to know the True God</hi>
by his Proper Name of Love; 1. <hi>John.</hi> 5. 20. The Preventing Love of God
in the Bosom of Christ cometh to Thee, poureth forth itself in thy Bosom,
giveth Thee a new Eye to see the Divine Beauty; a new Ear to hear the
heavenly Melody; a new heart to take in, rellish, and understand the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Sweetnesses, Fulnesses, Joys of this First Love, Love in its Fountain, in
the Fountain of Eternity.</p>
            <p>This New Wine of the Everlasting Kingdom giveth itself to Thee with a
New Bottle, a New Spirit, which will take in, and hold this precious Liquour.
Not one drop, of it shall ever fall besides this Bottle, or be spilt out of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But still thou poor, troubled, trembling Soul thinkest the glad
Tydings of the Gospel, of Pure, Preventing Love too good to be true. Thus
thou arguest against thy self, If I were but moderately evil, or morally good;
if I could in any degree comply or close with <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> when he offereth
his Love, and himself to me: then might I have some hope, that I had some
place in his heart. But, if the Lord Jesus himself should shine forth with the
Sweetest Vision of Preventing Love in the midst of my Fleshlinesses, Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
hardnesses, Enmities; and should say to me, as the Angel to Mary;
hail thou, that are greatly Beloved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hail thou, that are freely Beloved: I
should not onely wonder at this Salutation; but believe it all to be a vain
Dream of my deluded Fancy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:49838:218"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Let me tell Thee a Story. A beautiful <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Youth, when his
Friends desired to take his Picture, desired them to take him up seven daies
after his death, and then to take his Picture. Thou, the most defiled; the most
deformed Sinner, wert once beautiful, once in the freshness, and flower of thy
Youth, in Paradise. It is true; thou art now dead, dead of the most loathsom
disease, dead by the most killing, and corrupting Death, dead in sin; Yet now,
after that thou hast bin many years dead, Jesus Christ in his Glorified Person
cometh like a Bridegroom from heaven, not onely to take thy Picture but to
take thy Person into the Arms of his Preventing Loves, to breath bis Prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Loves into Thee, as a New Life, the Spring of a New Beauty, excelling
that, which was lost by Thee in Paradise, incorruptible, that never fadeth, not
passeth away.</p>
            <p>Ladies and Queens have sometimes hatched Eggs in their Bosoms. Thy
dead, deformed Person will thy Saviour hatch in the warm and naked Bosom
of his Preventing Loves unto a Divine Life, that shall answer Love with
Love, and flourish in the Loveliness of every Grace, every Glory, through thy
New-born Soul, and body, according to their proper seasons.</p>
            <p>Having known the Love of the Lord my Spirit laboureth, yet not my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but the Love of the Lord Jesus in my Spirit laboureth by all means to bring
forth itself in the fresh, and full Sense of its First, its Free, its Preventing
Sweetnesses, in your hearts; as a Spring of Living Waters in a dry, and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Wilderness. But, as a tender Mother taketh a beloved Child, weak, and
peevish; laieth it in her lap; poureth a Cordial down into its stomack: so will
your Jesus do with you, O Grieved Spirits, who are weak, without strength;
froward, &amp; will not take in his Love. He will take you, lay you upon his knees,
and pour this precious Cordial of his Preventing Loves into your Mouths.
Then will it go right, and sweet down to the bottom of your heart; There it
will become a Well springing up with pure, sweet, and plentiful Streams of
every Spiritual Truth, Grace, Comfort, or Joy unto Eternal Life. This is
The First State of Love in the Lord <hi>Jesus; Preventing Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. There is in the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> poured forth from the Father <hi>a Fulness of
all Assisting Love. 2. Cor. 14. v.</hi> 7. 8. 9. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had a thorn in his Flesh,
messengers of Satan sent to buffet him. He prayed thrice, that he might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from them. He had this answer from the Lord: <hi>My Grace is sufficient
for Thee.</hi> Many tender-hearted Saints, who feel their Lusts, as Thorns in their
Flesh; who feel their Passions, as the Messengers of Satan, the Angels of the
Dragon buffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing them; cry out frequently in the Agonies of Fear, and Grief;
O this Lust! O this Thorn in my Flesh! Sure at last it will wound me so
deeply to the heart, that it will let out the Life-blood of all faith, hope, grace,
and comfort. O this Passion! O this Messenger of Satan! It will one day carry
me back again into those Chains of Darkness, and that Bottomless Pit, out of
which I seem to my self sometimes to have escaped. But, O Believer! tossed
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:49838:218"/>
with the Tempests, be comforted. Fear none of these things. Look up conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
to the Blessed Person of your dear Saviour lifted up into Glory in the
midst of your Spirits. See the Father pouring forth himself into the Fulness, the
Glorious Fulness of all Assisting Loves in his Bosom. Pray continually; and
hear this Blessed voice from the Mouth of your Saviour continually sounding
in your ears; <hi>My Assisting Loves are sufficient for Thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But some Soul, that wanteth Comfort, will say, When the Lord Jesus
hath once by his Preventing Love planted a New Principle, and Habits of
Grace in me, he now expecteth; that I should improve this Principle, and
act these Graces. If I do this, and make use of that, which I have: I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
look for his Assisting Love, and that more Grace should be still
given me. But what New Loves can I promise my self to accompany me, and
carry me on in my way; while I so ill requite the Lord Jesus for his First Loves,
that I suffer his Gifts to lye unimproved, his Graces to lye unactive in me, hid
in the Earth by my Sloth, or Sensuality?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall proceed in my answer to this <hi>Objection</hi> by <hi>Three Steps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p.</hi> This <hi>Objection</hi> wrappeth up together in it something <hi>True,</hi> something
<hi>False.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. This is <hi>False;</hi> That the Assisting Love of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> dependeth
upon our Emprovement of Grace already received from him. This is not
True; No; by no means. Assisting Love is as free, as full, as absolute, as much
all, as much alone in Carrying on the Work of Grace in us: as Preventing
Love is in Beginning it. God hath poured forth in <hi>Christ</hi> the Fulness of all
Assisting Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am the Truth, the way, and the Life;</hi> saith our Saviour. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is the
<hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi> of all Grace in the <hi>way,</hi> as much, as in the Beginning, or
End. <hi>Without me ye can do Nothing.</hi> Every Act of Grace, every thing in every
Act of Grace, which distinguisheth it from a meer Non-Entity, from an Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Nothing; Every Degree of Spiritual Being in the whole Life of Grace
with all the Exercises of it through the whole way from the Beginning to the
End; is all alike, Immediately from <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That, which is True in the <hi>Objection</hi> is this; the Emprovement of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Principles, the Exercise of our Graces are attended with Clearer Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Sweeter Enlargements, more Divine heighthnings of all heavenly
Truths, Graces, and Consolations in us. On the other siide, when Faith is
not acted, when holiness is neglected: Darkness, Decay, Distress, and Death
dwell upon us. But these things are all entirely Consequences, and Effects; not
Causes, or Attractives of Assisting Love The Assisting Love of our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi>
is as the Sun, which by its Presence bringeth Light, Warmth, Fruitfulness,
Life, Beauty, Pleasurealong with it. When it withdraweth itself, leaveth
the Cold, hardness, Storms, Desolation of Winter behind it.</p>
            <p>The Bridegroom chargeth the Virgins of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by the Roes, and Hinds
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:49838:219"/>
of the Field, that they stir not up, nor awake his Love, until She please. <hi>Cant.</hi>
2. 7. The Angels of heaven, which are the Invisible Ministers, by whom all
things move in the whole Order of Second Causes; are here understood accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the sense of some learned Divines, By the Virgins of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> The
Roes, and hinds of the Field are the Pleasant Loves, and Lovelinesses of the
Eternal Spirit in the heavenly Person of <hi>Christ.</hi> The Law of the Eternal
Beauties, and Loves of the Divine Nature lieth upon all things, upon all the
Ministers, and Armies of God; that the Spouse of Christ be never laid to sleep,
or awakened; but according to its own good pleasure, as it is One Spirit with
the Lord Jesus by a knot of Everlasting Love, as a Queen at the Right hand
of her King, set down in Heavenly Places with him, in him, upon the same
Throne. When the Divine Principle, which is the <hi>Bride,</hi> and the <hi>Spiritual
Man</hi> in a Saint retireth itself, and goeth to its rest: in this Night the Wild
Beasts, Bruitish Lusts, Raging Passions come forth to prey upon the Natural
Man covering it with filth, &amp; wounds. But, when the Day spring ariseth from
on high when the season cometh for this Man, this Heavenly Seed, &amp; Bride to
awake, to stir up her self, and come forth again; in this New Morning the
Beasts return to their Den; Lusts, and Passions sink down into their own
Principle, the Bottomless Pit, out of which they arose. But the Musick, to
which the Spiritual Spouse moveth in these Retirements, and Returns, is the
Love of the Spiritual Bridegroom, like the Silver Trumpets of the Sanctuary
in the Wilderness to the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> sounding a Retreat, and a Rest,
or a March, and a Progress.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But you will say; If there be nothing to be done by us, to what purpose
are all Duties, Prayers, Attendances on the Word? If nothing can be done
by us in the Acting, and Improvement of Spiritual Principles, to what end are
all Admonitions, Exhortations, Instructions, Promises, in the Holy Scriptures?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> These are all Assisting Love descending from the Bosom of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
above, into the Lap of his Bride below in various forms, like the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine,
&amp; Showers from Heaven falling upon the Bosom of the Earth. They are
the same Assisting Love ascending again by various degrees, in various Shapes,
or Growths, like the Flowers, &amp; the Corn shooting up out of the Ground. <hi>Hos.</hi>
2. 22. It is promised; <hi>that God will hear the Heavens, the Heavens shall hear the
Earth, the Earth shall hear the Corn and Wine; and the Corn and Wine shall hear
Jezreel. Jezreel</hi> is the <hi>Seed of God.</hi> All the Ordinances, all Forms, all Motions
not of <hi>Grace</hi> alone but of <hi>Nature</hi> also, are the Commerce, and Traffick of the
Divine <hi>Nature</hi> with itself, as it is the head of Fine Gold above all; and the
Hidden Pearl, the Precious Seed at the bottom of all. In every Step of things,
in every Form, in every Language of Heaven, and Earth, of Grace, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in every Ordinance, God seeth the face, heareth the Voice, answereth
the Cry of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> his own Seed, his own Son; <hi>Jezreel</hi> seeth the Face, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Voice, answereth the Call of God, of its Father. <hi>Jezreel</hi> is the Dove
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:49838:219"/>
whose Face is Lovely, whose Voice is Sweet to the Heavenly Bridegroom, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it be from the Holes of the Rock, and the Hollow places of the Stairs;
from the lowest, the darkest Dispensations, from the nethermost parts of the
Earth; from the meanest Ordinances; from an Inward, an Outward Prison, or
Grave. The Heaven, the Earth, the Corn, the Wine, Duties performed,
Ordinances enjoyed, Graces Acted, the Word published; All are the Green
Flourishing, Fruitful Bed of Preventing, or Assisting Loves, on which the
Lord Jesus, and his Spouse embrace each other.</p>
            <p>In Ordinances the heavenly Bridegroom pipeth, or mourneth to <hi>Jezreel,</hi>
the Divine Seed, his Sister-Spouse. In Duties, or Graces <hi>Jezreel</hi> danceth, or
mourneth to him again. Thorow all these Assisting Love sweetly shineth, or
soundeth from above; sweetly again reflecteth and Ecchoeth back from the
Spirit of a Saint below. This is the <hi>Answer</hi> in its <hi>First Step.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Step.</hi> The Reason given by the Philosopher, why the Heavens, which
we see over our heads move so regularly, so harmoniously, so constantly,
from the begining of the world hitherto, is this; They have Assisting Forms,
Intelligences, Angels, which move them, which turn them round. Many
Souls sweetly touched with the Allurements of Divine Love in <hi>Christ,</hi> fear
to come to him, to cast themselves into His Bosom by Believing. They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust
their own strength, and constancy for their continuance in a holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
They doubt they shall fall back with greater guilt and shame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
with greater reproach to the name of the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> Many weak
Christians are day and night tormented with like fears, and doubts; that they
shall fall away at last by the force of some Corruption, or the Difficulties in the
waies of Holiness. Dear Souls! be not discouraged from believing, or in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;
be not kept off from the Bosom of Christ, be not disquieted in His
Bosom by any fears or doubts. You have a Good Angel for an Assisting
Form, you have an Assisting Form brighter and more glorious, than the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and brightest Angel; more powerful, than all the Angels in Heaven. You
have the Assisting Love of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> present with you, in your Spirits,
by day, and by night. This doth move, this will move, and turn about your
Hearts, your lives regularly, harmoniously, constantly, in all the Circles of
Divine Graces, Truths, Joys, Glories, according to the Laws, and Patterns
in the Supreme Mind, in the Heart of God, thorow all times Eternally.</p>
            <p>Preventing Love is the Golden Chain, which draweth thee to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
of <hi>Christ.</hi> O run when thou feelest thy self so drawn. Assisting Love is
the Golden Chain, that tyeth thee fast, and close, immediately, inseparably, for
ever in these embraces. Rest with Confidence, and full Assurance in these em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces;
feed with desire and delight among the Lillies here; lye down to sleep in
these embraces. Thy sleep will be sweet to thee.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Step.</hi> Learned men and Divines teach us; that the Preservation of the
world is <hi>continuata Creatio,</hi> a continued Creation. In every moment of Time
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:49838:220"/>
from the Begi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning of the world to the end, the Divine Act of Preserving,
and Governing the world according to the Present form proper to it for
that Season is entirely the same with the Act of Creation. In every moment
from the Begining of the world to the end, the whole world with all things in
it rise up into the form designed for that moment in the Eternal Law of the
Divine Wisdom, out of the nothingness of the Creature out of the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of the Creator, as freely, as freshly, as fully, as Absolutely, as in the first
Moment of Its Being.</p>
            <p>So is it, and much more clearly, sweetly gloriously so in this Creation of God,
the Creation of <hi>Grace.</hi> Assisting Love is no other than Preventing Love Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued:
A continuation of Preventing Love. They say; A line is One Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
Point in motion. This is most true; All Assisting Love; the whole
Life of Grace, and Glory in a Saint is One, Individual, Unchangeable Point
of Preventing Love Eternal Love in Motion, spreading itself, within Itself
to an Infinite Circle.</p>
            <p>In every moment of a Saint's spiritual Being from his first Conversion to
Eternity the Act of Assisting Love in Preserving, in Governing thee is the
same with that first Act of Preventing Love in Regenerating thee.</p>
            <p>In every moment of thy Spiritual Being from thy first Conversion to thy
Glorification in Eternity, thy Spiritual Man the Divine Nature in thee riseth up
into the form of that Moment answering Its Pattern in the Heavenly Image,
the Glorified Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> out of thine own Nothingness; out of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
fulness of the God-head in <hi>Christ,</hi> as freely, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reshly, as sweetly, as
absolutely, as entirely; as in the first moment of the New-Birth in thee.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this Second State of Divine Love in <hi>Christ, Assisting Love</hi>
with that of the Greek Epigram thus translated: <hi>fer Fatum; sin ferre recuses;
non minus te feret Fatum.</hi> Bear thy Destiny. If thou refuse to bear it; thy
Destiny will nevertheless bear thee, and carry thee along. Cast thy self, O
believer into the Bosom of the Assisting Love of thy God in <hi>Christ,</hi> to be
born up, and carried along in it. But if thou refuse, and murmure; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
this Assisting Love will take thee into Its Bosom, and bear thee and carry
thee along with It in Its own Way laid out and lifted up in Heaven in the
Spirit into Eternal Joys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we believe not; yet is He faithful, and cannot deny Himself.</hi> God is
Love He cannot deny Himself in the unchangeablness of His Divine Essence
which is Love. He is True and faithful to the unity and simplicity of his own
naked Being which is Love in the midst of all our changes, unbeliefs, unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</p>
            <p>3. There is poured sorth from the Heart of the Father in the Bosom of our
Glorified Saviour <hi>The fulness of all finishing Love.</hi> I know no Scripture, which
displayeth the finishing Love of God in <hi>Christ</hi> with more sweetness, riches
and fulness; than that; <hi>Ephes. 2. v.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. You have here <hi>Love</hi> under
several names in five verses repeated six times; <hi>Mercy; Love; Grace; Grace;
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:49838:220"/>
Kindness; Grace.</hi> You have it brought in with Magnifying Titles, <hi>Rich in
Mercy; Great Love; Exceeding Riches of Grace.</hi> The Salvation of a Saint is
here presented to us, as a rich Piece of fine Enamelling. First the Ground on
which the Enamelling lieth, is Gold. Then you have the rich Enamel upon
the Gold. Lastly some beautiful Picture is formed in the Enamel. Such a
piece of Divine Work is a Saint. 1. The Ground of the Work is Pure Gold,
Pure Love, Preventing Love, God doth all from Rich Mercy, for the Great
Love wherewith he hath loved us, <hi>v.</hi> 2. 2. The rich Enamelling upon this
rich Ground of Love is Love too. All the Work is a curious, close, and fine
Enamelling of Divine Love upon a glorious Ground of Love. You have this
brought in and doubled, <hi>v. 3, 8. By Grace ye are saved.</hi> 3. The Beautiful
Picture formed in this Enamel of Love upon a Ground of Love is, the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Face of Divine Love, naked, entire in all its Lovelinesses and Glories,
to ravish all Spirits into a delightful Admiration: <hi>That to the Ages to come
might be shown the Exceeding Riches of his Grace, v.</hi> 7. This is the End of
God in <hi>Christ.</hi> He draweth upon the whole Person of a Saint, the Heavenly
Form, the Divine Figure of Love, as Love is God; of Himself, as God is
Love. He draweth this Divine Figure of Love in all its Riches, in those
Riches of Sweetness, Loveliness, Glory, which exceed, which transcend all
Degrees, all Capacities, all Understandings in the Creature. He doth it to this
end, that the Father, the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> all Angels, and Spirits, all Creatures,
<hi>in Ages to come,</hi> that is, in Eternity may see with Extasies of Joy and Wonder,
the Entire Form of Divine Love in its most naked, most lively, richest Beauties,
figured upon, and shining in the whole Person of a Saint from one end of
his Story unto the Other. Do you not discern the <hi>Finishing Love</hi> of God in
<hi>Christ</hi> making All perfect in Eternity?</p>
            <p>The Ground of the Work of God in a Saint is Love. It is all inlaid in
every point of it with Love. It is All Overlaid with Love. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> had
gone through the Particulars, and several times declared All to be <hi>Grace, Pure
Love:</hi> after all that he wrappeth up all over again in <hi>Grace,</hi> in <hi>Pure Love.</hi> By
<hi>Grace ye are saved; v.</hi> 8. A Saint is like a Gold-Watch in a Gold-Case; A
Work of Love in a Covering of Love, as rich, as the Work. If you go never
so low all thorow a Saint to the Nethermost parts of the Earth to his lowest
Foundations; All is Love. If you search into the Heights of Eternity above
him, round about him; All is Love, Comprehending, Crowning Love.</p>
            <p>You will see the Fulness of the <hi>Finishing</hi> Love of God in <hi>Christ</hi> yet, more
clearly: if you consider <hi>Three Things</hi> set before you in <hi>this Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It is Love, which is the Supream Sun of Eternity, which generateth us
to a Divine Birth, which infuseth a Divine Principle of Life into us, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakeneth
it in us. <hi>For his greatest Love, wherewith he hath loved us, he hath
quickened us, v.</hi> 4. 5. This is <hi>Pre-venting Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Love, which maintaineth, carrieth on, floweth forth into the Stream
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:49838:221"/>
of Divine Life in us from the Beginning to the End. <hi>By Grace ye are saved;
He hath raised you. v.</hi> 5. 6. The Way of a Saint is a Continued Resurrection
Every Moment is a New Resurrection, every Resurrection supposeth a Death.</p>
            <p>The whole Way o a Saint from the First Incarnation of Christ in him
is a Contexture of Deaths and Resurrections, Divine Lights of Life and
Shades. This whole Way of a Saint; the Deaths, as well, as the Resurrections
the Shades, as well, as the Lights, are Divine Grace, Pure Love. Love put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
on the form of Death, and shineth thorow it. Death putteth on the Form
of Love, and shineth in it. This is <hi>Assisting Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Love, which setteth us down in Heavenly places. Love maketh itself a
Heaven of glory and bliss; a Kingdom of Joy, a Throne of pure Gold; a Crown
of Immortality. This is Finishing Love. They are the same Riches of Mercy,
the same Greatnesses of Love, which shine forth in our hearts at our Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
at every Resurrection; and in Heaven at our Glorification. God rich in
Mercy, for his great Love hath quickened us, raised us, set us down in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Places. All is the Same Love, the <hi>Seed,</hi> the <hi>Tree,</hi> the <hi>Blossom,</hi> the <hi>Fruit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 All the Steps in the whole Way of a Saint from the Beginning to the
End are so many <hi>Love-Unions. He hath quickened us together with Christ; v.
5. He hath raised us together</hi> with him; <hi>He hath set us down together; v.</hi> 6
Every new Step in Grace, or Glory is a New Love-Union.</p>
            <p>Every Act of Divine Life is composed of a Blessed, and Beautiful Trinity
of Divine Loves. 1. There is the Lord Jesus, That Spirit, which is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Love, the Essential Image, the Eternal Son of That God which is Love;
the Bridegroom, and Beloved of a Holy Soul. 2. There is the Spirit of a Saint,
the Sister, the Spouse, the Love of this Love, this Bridegroom; Spirit of the
same Spirit; Love of the same Love; sprung from the same Root, formed into
the same Image, and Tree, bearing the same Fruits of Divine Love. 3. There
is the Holy Spirit, the Marriage-Dove, the Marriage-knot, the Love-Union
between these Two Divine Loves. Thus every Act, every Moment of a
Saint's Life is a Divine Trinity of Heavenly, Eternal Loves coming forth in
a New Dress suitable to each New Moment.</p>
            <p>3. All the Parts of a Gracious, or Glorious Life are acted; all the Forms,
and Moments of the State of a Saint; His Beginning, Progress, End are acted,
and comprehended in the Pure Element of Heavenly Love; in the Divine
World of Spiritual Love; in that Great, and Glorious Deep, into which all
the Fountains of Love in the whole God-Head, in the Heart of the Father
are broken up, and pour forth themselves, in the Glorified Person of the Lord
Jesus. <hi>He hath quickened us together in Christ; v. 5. He hath raised, us together,
made us to sit together in Heavenly Places in him; v.</hi> 6. Thus you see the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluteness,
the Compleatness of Finishing Love, as well, as of <hi>Preventing,</hi> and
<hi>Assisting Love.</hi> You see the Finishing Love of the Father poured forth with all
Fulness in our Blessed Saviour: You see Divine Love in the Bosom of your Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:49838:221"/>
Alone Beginning Alone Continuing the Work of Grace, Alone in
the Purity, Power, Simplicity of Free Grace Finishing, Perfecting All in
Glory.</p>
            <p>I will make this clear to you by <hi>One Scripture</hi> more; 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. he hath
saved us not according to works, which we have done, but according to his own
Purpose, and Grace given to us in Christ, before the World was; Who hath abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
Death, and brought Life, and Immortality to Light by his Appearance in the
Gospel</hi> Behold this Heavenly Sight! Believe, rejoyce, and wonder. A Saint is a
Spiritual Building of all Heavenly Graces, and Glories. It is entirely composed
thorowout of Free Grace, of Pure Love. The Foundation of it is laid in the
Fair Colours of Divine Love, all the Rooms, the several Stories, the Furniture,
the Riches, the Entertainment is of Pure Love. The Roof is laid with the
Precious stones of Pure Love. The whole Work of a Saint's Salvation, the
Materials, the Form the Proportions. the Measures of the Whole, and of every
Part are Free Grace, Pure Love <hi>He hath saved us according to his Purpose, and
Grace given us in Christ before the World was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Word <hi>Purpose</hi> signifieth properly the <hi>Fore-laying</hi> of a thing.</p>
            <p>This Divine B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ilding of Love, this Heavenly Frame of Life, and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
which is the True Form of a Saint, was set up in the Glorious Person
of our Jesus from Eternity. All, that is done in time is the unvailing, and
Discovery of this Heavenly, and Eternal Building by Degrees, according to the
Measure of the Appearance of the Lord Jesus in us, in whose Person, and
Spirit this Frame standeth, as a Living, Precious Corner-stone, out of which
<hi>it is</hi> grown up; as a most pleasant Situation, which encompasseth it on every

            <p>This Palace, this Temple of Divine Love, of Light, of Life, of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is Eternal in the Heavens, in <hi>Christ.</hi> Time, Flesh, Sin, the whole Work
of this Creation are a Vail of Darkness, and Death cast upon It. As <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
shineth forth upon the Soul in the Gospel, he casteth off this Vail, he abolisheth
this Death, he discovereth, and bringeth forth into the Clearness, and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Its own Divine Light this Divine Frame of Life, and Immortality,
which is the True Saint, the New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Bride, the Lamb's wife
coming down out of Heaven with her Beloved ready trim'd.</p>
            <p>How manifest, how full is the Finishing Love of God in Christ? The whole
Being of a Saint is a Building, where all the Materials, the Work, the Finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is Pure Love. Pure Love finished all its Works in this Building, before it
began the World, from Eternity; and set it up in the Person of <hi>Christ.</hi> Pure
Love cleanseth it from the Dust of Time, the Filth of Flesh, and bringeth it
forth into the clear Lights of Grace, of Glory, which are the Brightness of its
own Spiritual Beauties, in the Evangelical Appearances, and Out-Shinings of
<hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>

of God in Christ.</p>

               <pb n="414" facs="tcp:49838:222"/>
1. Receive the Love of God in <hi>Christ.</hi> It is a sweet, and easy work. For
this Love giveth reception to itself in the Soul. When the Sugar taketh in the
Wine; In truth the Wine into which the Sugar is cast, or which is poured
upon it, worketh itself into the Sugar, then melteth, and dissolveth it into One
Body with itself; until you can no more distinguish between the Sugar, and
the Wine. So the Soul lieth in the midst of Divine Love. Love in its own
way, by its own force worketh and melteth itself into the Soul, until it have
melted and wrought the Soul into One Spirit, One Love with itself.</p>
            <p>Divine Love is received into thy Soul, as thy Soul is received into thy
Body; by Bringing it forth New out of its own Bosom; by Comprehending
it in itself; by Forming it unto a Divine Image of Itself; by Inhabiting,
Filling, Acting it; by Delighting in it, as its Daughter, Sister, Spouse, as its
self multiplyed. Receive this Love, which thus receiveth you, giveth reception
to itself in you.</p>
            <p>2. Resign your selves to Divine Love. This Love worketh all your works,
all its own works in you, and for you; all Works of Love and of Loveliness.
Philosophy teacheth us, that all Colours are Light mingled with Shade in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
degrees, and manners; until it break up thorow the Shades, and drink up
the Shades into One Pure Brightness. The Gospel teacheth us; that all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are Divine Love shining variously, and gradually forth, thorow the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of our Spirits; until by a sweet and Heavenly Force, as the Fire of the
Divine Life kindled from the Throne of God, it burn out, and burn up all
those Darknesses, Distances, De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

make us perfect, wanting nothing.</hi> This is the same thing, as if he had said;
Let Divine Love, Preventing, Assisting Finishing Love have their Perfect
work. These will make you Perfect, wanting nothing. This is the Grace of
Patience; the Love of God in <hi>Christ</hi> by its own force insinuating itself into
our Souls; by its own Charms alluring our Souls, tempering them to a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Repose in it, a sweet, entire Resignation to it; until it have wrought
out, and finished its own Glories upon it.</p>
            <p>Patience hath its Perfect Work; when Love hath its Perfect work. Love
hath its Perfect Work in us; when we oppose nothing of the Devil to it;
when we mingle nothing of our own with it.</p>
            <p>O that I were indeed a Minister of the Gospel! Then I should minister
the Spirit to you, which is Love; The Fountain, and the Sea of Love. Then
while I speak of Love, you would feel the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in his own proper Form,
in the Form, and Fulness of Divine Love coming down upon you, entering
into you, forming himself in you unto a Free Reception of himself, a Full
Resignation to himself, until he had Finished his own most Lovely Form of
Heavenly Love in you.</p>

               <hi>Use</hi> 3. Be aware, that you must receive the Love of God in <hi>Christ</hi> thorow
Death. St <hi>Paul</hi> admonisheth us, that <hi>as many, as are baptised into Christ, are
baptised into the Similitude of his Death. Rom.</hi> 6. 3. If we will be baptised into
the Love, we must be baptised into the Death of the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi> When
<hi>Moses</hi> son was circumcised, <hi>Zipporah</hi> his wife said to him; <hi>A bloody husband
hast thou been to me.</hi> Some interpret the Words, as they run in the Hebrew;
<hi>Thou hast been to me a Husband in Blood.</hi> So they are the Solemn words of
that Sacrament pointing out the Truth figured in that Type. The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi>
is a Husband to Thee in his own Blood. Thou must also be a Spouse to him
in thine own Blood,</p>
            <p>St <hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>Ye are dead to your first Husband by the Dead Body of Christ,
that ye may be married to another, to him, who is risen from the Dead. Rom.</hi> 7. 4.
You must come thorow the Death of <hi>Christ</hi> into his Marriage-Bed. You
cannot lye down in the Embraces of his Love in Glory; except ye be first
married to his Crucified Body, and united to that in the Embraces of Death.
<hi>Flesh, and Blood</hi> saith St <hi>Paul cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi> into the
Kingdom of Spiritual Love.</p>
            <p>If a Fleshly, a Natural Spirit striveth to enter into the Love of God in the
Glorified Person of our Lord <hi>Jesus:</hi> it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alleth short of the Truth, the Life; it
attaineth to a Similitude only. The Love and Glory of the Father, of <hi>Christ,</hi> of
Heaven to the most raised Spirit of this Creation is an Enchantment, Delusion,
a Dream. This G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace of God in the Figure, this Divine Love in a Dream is for
the most part turned into Wantonness, &amp; Lust. So men become in the heighth
of the Purest Notions, of the Sweetest Images no more than <hi>Filthy Dreamers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Death of <hi>Christ</hi> in the New Birth, in Purity, and Power of the holy
Ghost is the Angel with a Flaming Sword turning every way, which keepeth
the Entrance into the True Paradise, the Way to the Tree of Divine Love,
as well, as of Divine Life. The Eternal Spirit is the Flaming Sword. Death here
in its outward form is an Angel ministring to this Spirit. He, that dieth by
this Sword, and Flame in the hand of this Angel, cutteth off, burneth up all
Fleshly Forms, and Lives; is in the same moment new-born into a Divine,
Immortal Spirit. In this Spirit he entereth into the Paradise of Love in the
Third Heavens, above the Heaven of Sense, or all things Visible, above the
Heaven of Reason, Angels, all things Invisible, Intellectual, of the First Creation;
in the Glorified Person of Christ. Here nothing entereth, which hurteth, or

            <p>But be not discouraged, when ye hear of a Baptism in Death, before the
Heavens open and the Dove, Divine Love descend to rest upon you, to give
you rest in itself. It is Love itself, which is the Baptiser, which leadeth you,
and goeth down with you into Death. It is a River of Love, which is the
<hi>Jordan,</hi> the Death, into which you go down, and are baptised.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are baptised,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith in the forementioned place, <hi>into the Similitude
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:49838:223"/>
of Christ's Death.</hi> The Death of <hi>Christ</hi> was Death in Truth; a Substantial,
Real Death. The Death of <hi>Christ</hi> in a Saint is Eternal Love, Eternal Life
in the Likeness, and Form of Death; a Similitude onely of Death in a Substance
of Immortal Love, and Glory, in the Person of our <hi>Jesus</hi> ascended.</p>

               <hi>Use.</hi> 4. Take heed of mingling the Lusts of the Flesh with Spiritual Loves.
Jealousy is the Rage of God, as well, as of Man. It burneth to the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Earth. A Fly bred out of Dung so infested the Eagle, that it
forced him to lay his Eggs for safety in the Lap of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the Heathen-God.
The Fly mounteth up aloft, carrieth up some Dung with it, letteth it fall into

the Eagle's Eggs with it, which fall broken to pieces upon the ground.</p>
            <p>This is a Fable. The Moral is good. Thou art a Saint. Thou layest the
Births of the Divine Spirit in Thee, thy Graces, Hopes, Joyes with thy self
in the Bosom of Divine Love. O take heed, that thy Flesh, that Dung-Fly,
mingle nothing of its Filth with these Births of the Spirit in the Pure Bosom
of Heavenly Love. If it do; assure thy self, that Love will cast all the Filth,
all Flesh out of its Chast, and Spiritual Embraces, As that falleth to the
Ground, thou also wilt fall with it, and have many a broken bone, many a
broken heart.</p>
            <p>We read in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Dragon, and his Angels in Heaven toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Michael, and his Angels. But they fought there, till the Dragon,
and his Angels were cast out. Thou, O Believer, art a Heaven in which God
dwelleth as Love, where all the Angels, as Angels of Love; where all Forms
of things are, as Heavenly Angels of Pure Love round about him ministring
to him. Shall there be now seen in this Heaven, in thy Person, O Believer,
silthy Lusts, furious Passions; the Dragon, and his Angels together with the
Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> Divine Love, and its holy Angels. How hateful, how horrid a
Wonder! What a Prodigy is this?</p>
            <p>If it be so, let there be no rest in the Heaven of thy Spirit; let there be a
continual Fight, until the Dragon with his Angels, the Fleshly Spirit with its
Lusts, and Passions be cast out. When the Unclean Dog, and the fiery Dragon
are no more; Thy Lamb will feed, and lye down to rest; thy Turtle will
make its Nest, and enjoy its Mate, its Beloved in quiet. Nothing shall disturb,
or make them afraid in all the Paradise of Divine Love.</p>
            <p>Use. 5. Comfort your selves, O Believers. You travel thorough the Valley

a Valley of Tears, a Mournful Valley; where all the Trees, that grow, are
Mulberry Trees, Emblems of Grief, and Wo.</p>
            <p>You are frequently overspread with the black Shades of Fear, Unbelief,
Doubt, Distrust, Despair. You often fall into the hands of violent Robbers,
Evil Spirits in the forms of various Temptations, Corruptions, Passions. These
spoil you, leave you naked, wounded, desolate. You dig up pits in Duties,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:49838:223"/>
Ordinances. But many times no Rain, no Descent of the Spirit from Heaven
filleth these Pits.</p>
            <p>Yet be not discouraged, all you, who believe the Love of God in <hi>Jesus
Christ.</hi> Strengthen the feeble Knees. You shall go on from Strength to Strength,
from Light to Light; so you shall come every one of you at last to a Clear
Sight, to a Compleat Fruition of the God of Gods on Mount Sion, of God in
his Supreme Glory, in the Nakedness, Purity, Simplicity, Unity of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Spirit. Lift up the feeble hands. These weak Graces of yours mixt, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with so much Corruption; These weak Persons; Bodies, and Spirits
wearied, wounded, stained with so many Sufferings, Sins, and Sorrows shall
be crowned with perfect Glory.</p>
            <p>For why? Pure Love, Almighty Love, That Love, which is itself God
over all Blessed for ever; This Love comes forth casting off all vails, pouring
forth itself from all its Eternal Springs, in all its Infinite Fulnesses in the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Person of <hi>Christ;</hi> This Love hath begun, and shall it not make an End?</p>
            <p>As Certainly, as it hath laid the Foundation, and you have cried to it; <hi>Grace,
Grace; Pure Love; Preventing Love;</hi> as Certainly, as it hath gone on to
build you up thus far; and still you have cried to it; <hi>Grace, Grace; Pure
Love; Assisting Love:</hi> so certainly will it lay the Top-stone. Your Eyes shall
see it. You shall in like manner cry to it, with a Shout of Angels, and Blessed
Spirits all round about you; <hi>Grace, Grace; Pure Love; Finishing Love.</hi>

            <p>There are <hi>Three Sorts</hi> of <hi>Comforts,</hi> which the <hi>Finishing Love</hi> of God in <hi>Christ</hi>

therefore gladly in my Infirmities. For, when I am weak, the Power of Christ
resteth upon me. My Grace.</hi> You have there the <hi>Father,</hi> the Fountain of Love,
the Fountain of Free Grace. You have at the end of the <hi>verse,</hi> the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi>
Glorified, into whom this Fountain floweth continually, covering his Person
all over without, filling it all within with the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ories, Immortalities and Joys
of Divine Love. This <hi>Jesus</hi> resteth upon St <hi>Paul</hi> in the Power, in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of All his Loves; He maketh Perfect, he finisheth his Loves, the Pure,
and heavenly Work of his Loves upon him; when he is weakest.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> discovereth a <hi>Mystery</hi> here. A <hi>Mystery</hi> is a <hi>Divine Secret:</hi>
A Divine Glory with a Divine Vail cast over it; a Divine Light surrounded
with a Divine Darkness; The Head of <hi>Christ</hi> all Pure, Fine Gold covered
with Locks, and Curles black, as a Raven. The <hi>Mystery,</hi> which the Holy
Ghost here unvaileth to us is, One of the richest, and sweetest among all the
Mysteries of the Gospel. It is the Mystery of Love, of <hi>Finishing Love.</hi> Blessed
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:49838:224"/>
are those Eyes, that see the Glory; Blessed are those Hearts, that understand,
and rellish the Sweetness of This Mystery. It is This: When Divine Love
would put forth itself in Greatest Power, and Glory; when it would finish,
make Perfect the general, or any Particular Work of Love in us: it chooseth
that Season, when we are weakest, lowest, have least of Loveliness, Life, Love,
or Suitableness to Love; when we are in the greatest unlikelyhood for it; when
we seem to be at the greatest Distance from it.</p>

            <p>1. <hi>Qu.</hi> Who the heavenly Bride's own People are.</p>

Spirits in Glory.</hi> It was said of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he died; <hi>He was gathered to his
People.</hi> While a holy Soul is in this World, she is, as an unknown Princess
under a Disguise, in a strange land, the language whereof she understandeth
not. In Death this Princess-Bride returneth home to her own People, to her
own Kindred, her own Relations, and Acquaintances. There all understand the
languages, Faces, and hearts of Each other. There they mutually drink in the
Spirits of Each Other, and in the Spirits of Each other all Pure, Immortal
Loves, Beauties, Joys.</p>
            <p>There is another <hi>Scripture,</hi> which commenteth upon this, and confirmeth
our Explication of it: It is <hi>Eccles. 12. 7. The Dust returneth to the Earth, as it
was: The Spirit to God, who gave it.</hi> That which is translated <hi>God,</hi> is in the

God <hi>cum Indumentis suis:</hi> as he cloatheth himself with the Forms of Angels,
and appeareth in them. The Soul of a Saint cometh forth from the Land
of Angels, and Glorious Spirits, in the midst of which God reigneth, into this

World, as into an Exile or Banishment. When it dieth, then it goeth home to
its own Countrey, and People; to its own City, and Fellow-Citizens; The
Inhabitants of the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the Mother of us all.</p>
            <p>I shall add one <hi>Text</hi> more, which will make all the rest Clear; <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.

Their Native Countrey. Then to prevent a mistake you are told; that this

from that, and plainly called; <hi>A heavenly Country;</hi> Their Native
Land, which is a heavenly Countrey. Behold those whom the Spouse of

These are described in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews, The Assembly of the First-born.</hi>
all Forms of things, all the Saints, in Spiritual Beings, and Beauties, in the
Likeness of <hi>Christ,</hi> as he is the first-born of every Creature, before they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend

            <p>Answ. <hi>Again I am ignorant, why the same word is rendred in the Margin

               </gap>orth Immediately from the Womb of the

of the God-Head. Thus is <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> with the Dew of his Youth upon him
as Fair, as Fresh, as unfading as a New-blown Rose in the Morning, while the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:49838:225"/>
Pearly Dew lieth yet upon it. <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is now, as a Bridegroom upon his
Coronation Day, or as a King upon his Marriage-Day. Now his People are
a Princely People, all Fellow-Kings together with him. Now the holy Soul
is That Princess, and Daughter which is his Queen all in Beaten Gold at his
right hand.</p>
            <p>The Willing People are Princes, heavenly Spirits in Glory. This is the
<hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Second Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Qu.</hi> What are the Chariots of the Princely People?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The <hi>Chariots</hi> are the <hi>holy Angels.</hi> Psal. 68. 17. <hi>The Chariots of
the Lord are Thousands; Ten Thousands of Angels. God is in the midst of
them, as on Sinai, in the holy Place</hi> You may observe in your <hi>Bibles</hi> that word
<hi>Place</hi> not to be printed with the same letter, as <hi>holy,</hi> to signifie, that it is not
in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> but added by the Translatours.</p>
            <p>The Holy <hi>may be here any of these, or rather all of these in their Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;

<hi>of</hi> Christ, Christ Mystical, <hi>the</hi> Spiritual Temples; Heaven, <hi>the</hi> Everlasting
Glory <hi>of the</hi> God-Head, <hi>in which Christ resideth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sinai</hi> was a Type to all these. These in their several degrees are <hi>Sinai</hi> height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Sion,</hi> to the Perfection of the Divine Presence in the Beauty of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Love. You may see too, that <hi>As</hi> before <hi>Sinai</hi> is added. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
lieth thus; <hi>Sinai in the holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Thousands, and Ten thousands of holy Angels make all One Chariot
in which God rideth. Each Angel is also a Distinct Chariot The Chariots
of the Lord are according to the number of the Angels. But Each Angel
comprehendeth in himself the whole Millions, of Angels. They are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
in their Essential Forms; but undivided. As the same Colours, and
Lines varied make all Beauties: So all Angelical Forms in distinct Relations
make up the Essence, and Glory of Every Particular Angel. God with the
Thousands of his Chariots rested on Mount <hi>Sinai. Sinai,</hi> or <hi>Sion</hi> rather is in the
Lord <hi>Jesus;</hi> in the Assemblies of the Saints; in the Person, and Spirit of
every Saint; in Heaven; in the Spirit thorow all the Heavens, and the
Earth, in the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and every Saint.</p>
            <p>The Chariot of <hi>Solomon</hi> is the Chariot of his Queen also. The Bridegroom,
and the Bride ride together in the same Chariot; <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> and his Spouse;
<hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Brethren,</hi> his <hi>Fellow Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold then the Chariots of the Princely People of the Immortal Kings, of
Saints in Glory, in the Glory of Christ, and of the Spirit, whether in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or out of the Body. They are the Chariots of God; The Thousands,
and<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Ten Thousands of the holy Angels.</p>
            <p>These are in a double sense the Chariots of these Divine Princes; 1. These
Princes ride in them; 2. God rideth, upon them in these Princes, as on <hi>Sinai,</hi>
as on <hi>Sion,</hi> as in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:49838:225"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. The Chariot is the Divine Presence in the Light, and Evidence
of its own Appearance, with all its Train of Glories, and Angels, as in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
with the Universal Form of things comprehended in it, enlivened, and
enlightned by it; as in the Glorious Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> at the last day. This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Presence descending and ascending; resting upon, and shining forth in
the Prophets and Holy men of old in their Visions; is described Mystically;
<hi>Ezek. c.</hi> 1. and called by the <hi>Jews, The Chariot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>Wheels,</hi> Living, High, Dreadful, Glorious, Shining, as a Pretious
Stone, full of Eyes, that is, of Angels, of heavenly Spirits. I humbly offer it
to be considered; whether these <hi>Wheels</hi> be not the Elements, these Globes of
the Visible Earth, and Heavens, made New, made Spiritual, filled with Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Lives, cloathed with Angelical Forms, and Glories in the Kingdom of
the Spirit, and Mystical Person of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>Horses,</hi> which draw these <hi>Wheels</hi> are the <hi>Living Creatures, full
of Eyes.</hi> If the Wheels may be understood to be the visible Part; these Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creatures may present the Invisible Part of the Creation in its Renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by a Spiritual Glory flowing forth from the Fountain of The God-Head in
the Glorified Person of the Lord <hi>Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Wheels, and Horses together may perhaps not improbably be thought
to be <hi>the New Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Above the <hi>Wheels,</hi> and the <hi>Living Creatures</hi> is the <hi>Chariot</hi> itself, a <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
If I may pursue my former Apprehension with Submission to the Spirit
of Truth in every Spirit; I shall call this the <hi>New Heaven;</hi> The <hi>heavenly
Image,</hi> the God-Head unvailing itself, appearing in a New Glory. This is
the Firmament, the Heaven, born up, and carried along by the Innumerable
Company of Angels; while <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> sitteth in it, as in his Chariot.</p>
            <p>Above this Firmament is the Similitude of a Man; as Fire, from his Loins
upward, and as Fire from his Loins downward. This is our Blessed Saviour
in the Union of his Divine, and Humane Nature. The Glory of the Divinity,
of the Eternal Spirit cloatheth both with the same Similitude of Fire, which
shineth with the Sweetest Light burneth with the greatest force of Love,
transformeth all things with an Almighty Power into One Pure, Immortal,
Divine Flame with itself.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> himself speaketh of his own Coming, and Appearance in
his Kingdom after this manner; <hi>The Son of Man shall come in his own Glory,
in the Glory of his Father, and in the Glory of all His holy Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour seemeth to have had the same Vision in the Eye of his Spirit
which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had. The Jews distinguish the Angels into Angels of the
<hi>Throne,</hi> nearer to the Divine Majesty; Angels of <hi>Service,</hi> at a greater Distance.</p>
            <p>The Glory of the holy Angels make the New Earth; the Horses, and the
Wheels in the Chariot of the great King. The Wheels, the Visible Part of
the Creation, the Wheels are made of Angelical Glory: But they are the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:49838:226"/>
Angels of <hi>Service</hi> in a New, Spiritual Glory. The Invisible Things of the
Creation, the Living Creatures in the Chariot are the Angels of the Thron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
in the Glory of the Kingdom; of the Coronation,, and Marriage-Day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firmament,</hi> the <hi>New Heaven</hi> is the <hi>Glory of the Father;</hi> The Chariot
itself which containeth him, in which he descendeth, bowing down the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
as he descendeth. The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> himself in his own Glory is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from all these Glories, compre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>endeth them; and rideth forth in them.</p>
            <p>This is that Image, in which he shall appear at the last Day, as a New
Creator and a New Creation, making all things New; as the most Entire, most
Naked Image of the Invisible God, in all his most Pure, and most Invisible
Glories; as the First-born of the whole Creation in general, and of every
Creature in Particular; as the Whole Creation in its Virgin-State, in its
Ideal Glory, while yet it sprung up out of the Bosom of God, and stood onely
in the Bosom of God, and was a Sister-Spouse to the uncreated Beauty.</p>
            <p>This is that Testimony of Jesus, which is the Spirit of Prophesy; That
Divine Presence, that Word of God, which came to all the Holy Men of old,
in the Light of which, as in the Glass of Eternity, the First, and Supreme
Truth, they saw Visions, dreamed dreams, and spake of him. This is the
Chariot of the Princes; of the Saints in the Glory of the Spirit.</p>

the Glory of his Father, his own Glory, the Glory of all his holy Angels,
which is his Chariot, as he appeareth in her, translateth and transfigureth her
into the same heavenly Image. She also is now become a Chariot made up all
of the same Glories, with the same <hi>Jesus,</hi> the same Queen, the same Company
of Princes riding together in it. The <hi>Soul</hi> of the Bride is also <hi>Faith,</hi> the <hi>

            <p>This Divine Life in a Saint by a Descent of the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> upon it, in a
moment, ere a Saint is aware, he knoweth not how, both taketh him up to
set him in this Chariot, and Transformeth him into it.</p>
            <p>I have onely prepared you by all this for the Application of the Scripture
opened by us to our present purpose; that we may take in with a greater
Sense, with a Deeper Impression the Comfort, and Joys of Finishing Love
making Perfect its most Beautiful Works, and Displaying its most pleasant
Strengths in our Weaknesses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ere I was aware, my Soul made me, as the Chariots of my Princely People;</hi> or
<hi>set me in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hearken to me, my Brethren. Is there not among you a Poor Believer, a
Mournful Saint, which hath long prayed, long sighed for a Clear Sight of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:49838:226"/>
               <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> a Sense, and Seal of his Love, Sweet, and Constant Communion
with him? To this Soul I now speak. Perhaps after all this thou art embracing
the Dunghil of Distrust, and Despair. Perhaps thou art sitting upon the
Dunghil of some Fleshly Lust, or Earthly Care; of Covetousness, or Lascivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
Vanity, or vexation. Now, in a moment, which thou thinkest not
of, ere thou art aware, Jesus Christ in the Divine Brightness of some heavenly
Truth flashing, like Lightning, in upon thy Spirit, may descend, may discover
himself in his Heavenly Image, with his naked Glories, naked Loves to thee.
Now, are thou art aware, he may make this heavenly Image, at once a Laver
of Precious Blood, in which he washeth Thee white, as the Light itself, from
every Spot; a Chariot of heavenly Princes, in which he cometh down to Thee
upon thy Dunghil, taketh Thee off from thy Dunghil to ride with him in the
Fellowship of all Immortal Spirits, while all the holy Angels bear Thee up,
and carry Thee on upon the Firmament of the Father's Glory at the side of
thy Beloved, whither the Mind of the Spirit is for Thee to go.</p>
            <p>Ere thou art aware, the Lord Jesus can change thy Dunghil, can change
Thee, into a Divine Chariot of Eternal Spirits, in which he will ride forth
with Thee; thou shalt ride forth together with him having his Loveliness in
thine Eye, his Love in thine heart, thorow all Forms of things, Light, and
Darkness, Life, and Death, as thorow various Fields, differing Regions of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Beauties, and Delights in the Vast Continent, the Vast World of the
Divine Nature.</p>

an open field. He lieth upon the naked ground. He hath under his head for

Strength in this Weakness, giving him now the Evidence, the Pledge, the
First-fruits of that Spiritual Blessing, that heavenly Birth-right, which he had
a Promise of, and a Title to.</p>

of it. The Stone on which he lay, is now anointed, and becometh a Pillar,

Pure Love! <hi>For my Strength is made perfect in Weakness.</hi> The Strength of
Grace, of Love is made Perfect in Weakness. Behold <hi>Finishing Love!</hi> This
maketh the Infirmities not of old Age onely, but of our dying hour Pleasant
to us; that, when we are weakest, the Power of Divine Love resteth upon us
in its Finishing Sweetnesses, and Glories.</p>
            <p>When the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> hung upon the Cross, he cried out; <hi>My God, my
God: why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> A Darkness covereth the face of the whole
Earth round about Him. The next words, which we hear from him, just as
he giveth up the Ghost, are these: <hi>It is Finished;</hi> A Declaration of Victory;
A Triumph. The Mystery of my Sufferings, of Divine Wrath are finished
in my Person. The Glory of the God Head, of Heaven, of Eternity; All Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
all Joyes; The Mystery of Divine Love are finished, and compleated in my
Person. Both these Mysteries are now finished, Both Compleated in One Glory,
in this One Moment of my Death.</p>
            <p>This is the Pattern of a Saint, and of Finishing Love in the Pangs of Death.
You have a Saint sick on his Death-bed; a sense of Sin, of Wrath; Doubt,
Despair spreading their black Wings over his Spirit; pains, faintings, deadly
pangs seizing upon his Body. In a Moment, in the midst of these Weaknesses
the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in a Chariot of Angels, and Invisible Glories, with the full
Power of all Finishing Loves resteth upon him from without; raiseth himself
and shineth from within. Now in this Moment is the Whole Scen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> changed.
The black, and baleful. Image of Things is changed into a Heaven. The
fainting dying Person into a Glorified Spirit triumphing in his Chariot of
Angels, and ascending with the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> into the Heighths of Eternity.</p>
            <p>He crieth one moment; The Joys of Life, the Light of the Sun, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of mine Eyes, My Dearest Relations, and sweetest Friends, Life itself
forsake me. My hope, my Faith, my Spiritual Comforts; my God, my God,
why do ye, why doest thou forsake me?</p>
            <p>The Next moment with a Shout of Angels, with the Sound of the Silver
Trumpets in Heaven, he crieth out; <hi>It is finished.</hi> The Sufferings of <hi>Christ</hi>
are finished in me. Divine Love hath finished upon me all its Mysteries, and
made the Joys of Eternity full in me.</p>
            <p>

A modest Person was sick, and in want: A Friend sensible of his want, and
modesty conveyed a Bag of money under his head, and pillow, while he slept.
He waketh, findeth it, smileth, and saith: <hi>This is the Stealth of my Friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Jesus</hi> frequently casteth a deep Darkness, the Shadow of Death over
us then, when he purposeth under the covert of this Darkness to convey some
finished Piece of Glory, some Compleat Work of Finishing Love, Heaven
itself into our Bosom; our Persons into a Heaven of Immortalities, and Glories
unsought, unexpected, unperceived by us, until we are possessed of them, until
we are in the midst of Them. These are the <hi>Stealths</hi> of our Beloved. These
are the <hi>Stealths</hi> of <hi>Finishing Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Power of <hi>Christ</hi> with all the Fulness of <hi>Finishing Loves</hi> resting upon a
Saint in his Death is excellently described, 2 <hi>Corin. 5. v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Observe there <hi>Four things; 1. A Glorious Building. 2. The Groans of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
Saints. 3. The Workmanship of God, 4. The Earnest of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>A Glorious Building.</hi> This is <hi>A building of God;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>out of God.</hi> The
Materials, as well as the Builder, and the Form, are all of a Divine Nature. It
is a Pallace hewn out of the Rock, and standing in the Rock of Eternity. Gold,
precious Stones, Pearls, the Body of the Sun, Angelical Substances are, as
Dung to the Materials, of which this Building consisteth.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>Eternal;</hi> above Time; and so without Beginning, or End; above Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
and change.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>in the Heavens,</hi> in the Highest Heavens, the Heavens of Eternity, the
Heavens of Heavens, in the Eternal and Supream Spirit.</p>
            <p>It is situate in the most Divine Heighths, in the midst of the most Divine
Lights, Loves, Purities, Powers, and Pleasures; in the midst of the most Divine
Lives, and Immortalities.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The Groans of burthened Saints. We groan</hi> being burthened. The Burthen
is the Earthy Tabernacle; This Life; The Weight of vanity, and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
These burthened Spirits groan for the Dissolution of this Tabernacle.
But how? <hi>Not, that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon with our house
from Heaven;</hi> not to be <hi>found naked,</hi> but to have <hi>Mortality swallowed up of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth the meaning of the Unutterable Groans, with which
the Spirit of Supplications maketh Intercession in the Saints. They would
not be uncloathed of the Spiritual Image, which they put on at the New
Birth. They would not be uncloathed of the Natural Image, which
they put on at their First Birth. They would never, no, not for a moment
be found naked of any thing of that Life Light, or Sweetness, Heavenly, or
Earthly, which belong to either of these. No; they groan to have these cloathed
upon with that their Bui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ding from above; to have not onely their Immortal, and
Inward, but their Outward, and Mortal Part itself swallowed up into <hi>Life;</hi>
Life itself, in its Purity, in its Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ection, in its Spring, which is Eternity.</p>
            <p>3. The Workmanship of God in a Saint is wonderful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and indeed Divine
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:49838:228"/>
in this. <hi>Now he that hath made us for this,</hi> or, <hi>he that hath wrought us unto
this, is God.</hi> St <hi>Paul</hi> assureth every Saint, that his Groans are heard, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
from the Workmanship, and the Workman. We read in the <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;</hi>
that the <hi>Thighs</hi> of the Princess, and Bride are, <hi>as Jewels, the Work of the
hands of a Curious, and Faithful Workman.</hi> So the <hi>Word</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> signifieth.</p>
            <p>The Spiritual, and Natural Life; the Whole Frame, and Composure of a
Saint, Inward and Outward; all are Mysterious Jewels, wrought by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
hands of God himself, as a most Curious, and Faithful Workman, as a
most Skilful, and Firm Piece of Work. They are by an Unexpressible Wisdom,
and Love framed unto this; that the Substance of these Jewels should never
fail, the Vertue never decay, the Lustre never fade; no, not in Death itself;
but then most of all grow bigger, and brighter; more Pure, more, Perfect
more Powerful by being drunk up into Eternity; as the Waters of a fine
Spring, are drawn, and drunk up by the Sun.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The Earnest of the Spirit.</hi> Who hath also given us <hi>the Earnest of the
Spirit.</hi> The Eternal Spirit in the Immortal Soul, and Mortal Body of a Saint;
The Eternal Spirit, in which a Saint possesseth Soul, Body; things of Faith,
of Reason, of Sense; This Spirit is to a Saint an Earnest; both a foretast,
and a seal of this truth; that both the Soul, and the Body of a Saint in
Death, are like the Spice in the Golden Censor, or upon the Golden Altar in the
Temple, which is the Glorified Bosom of <hi>Christ.</hi> Both lose nothing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but change into a more Spiritual, and Divine Form, in which they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend,
and carry up all their Preciousness, all their Pleasantness with them, like
the Pillar of Smoak from the Altar perfumed with all the Spices of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,
in which those Spices themselves with all their Sweetness, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
go up refining, and enlarging themelves, till they rest and spread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in the Bosom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>How Curious, and Sure a Workman is <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> is the Love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Death of a Saint? O the Freedom, O the Fulness; O the Skill, O
the Faithfulness of Finishing Love in the Death of a Saint!</p>
            <p>O Believers! <hi>Preventing Love</hi> hath brought you out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> out of the
Servitude to your Lusts, and the God, the Spirit of this World. <hi>Assisting Love</hi>
hath carried you along thorough this Weary Wilderness, your Conformity,
and Fellowship with the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in his Sufferings. Be of good Courage.
Your Cloaths shall not wax old. Nothing of you shall fall in this Wilderness.
You shall certainly come into the Good Land, the Land of Promise, the
Land of Rest, the Land flowing with Milk, and Honey; with Life, and Peace;
Immortality, and Immortal Pleasures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finishing Love</hi> in the Glorious, and Immortal Person of your Beloved like the
Ark before the <hi>Israelites,</hi> shall lead you thorow this <hi>Jordan,</hi> thorow Death,
on the Dry, Firm, and Pleasant Land of Life itself. Not so much, as any single
Drops of any Dark Waters shall sprinkle themselves upon any Parts of your
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:49838:229"/>
Garment. The clear Streams of this Beloved River shall stand on heaps, on
each side of you; as Christal, or Diamond Rocks; as Lights, Prospects, and
Guards of Angels, while you pass.</p>
            <p>When You are weakest under the Pangs of Death, the Finishing Love of
Christ in Power, your Glorified <hi>Jesus</hi> in the Power of his Finishing Love
shall rest upon you, shall spring up in you; at once to comprehend you, and
enlarge you; to Cloath you upon, and to transform you within.</p>
            <p>Nothing of the Graces, and Joys of your <hi>Inward Man;</hi> Nothing of the
Beauties, and Delights of your <hi>Outward Man</hi> shall be divorced from you, or
darkened in you. Like a Heaven of Stars, they may pass under many Clouds;
But under all Clouds, they shall go on shining still, and increasing their Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre.
When they seem to be extinguished in Death, they shall be only drunk
up into that Pure Light of Life, which is Invisible to all Mortal Eyes by its
Fineness, and Fulness of Glory. They shall disappear onely by the Degree
of heightning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He, who hath wrought us unto this, is God.</hi> The Sweet Colours of a fair
Summer-Morning in the Sky are so made, that they fade not, but go on chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to fair and fresher Colours still, until they all vanish into Pure Light. For
These Colours are all the Light of the Approaching Sun figuring itself in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
degrees into Different Forms of Beauty; till at last It Break up into the
Full Glory of unmixt Light by the immediate Presence of the Sun appearing
with the unclouded Brightness of his heavenly Body.</p>
            <p>In like manner all the Excellencies, Entertainments, and Joys of a Saint,
in his Immortal, and Mortal Part; The Immortal, and Mortal Parts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of a Saint thorowout are so framed by the Father of Lights, and Loves;
that they can never fade, nor pass away; but in the moment of Death itself,
are cloathed upon from above with a Brighter, a Diviner Form, and are swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up into the Abysses, the Incomprehensiblenesses of Eternity.</p>
            <p>For God is Love. A Saint is a Birth of Love; A Seed of Divine Love
springing up in his Outward, and Inward Man, Forming itself into a Body
and Spirit, into all the Powers, Pleasures Objects, Relations of Both. Divine
Love is the Substance, and the Sap; The Matter, and the Form in all. A Saint
in his Essence, and Operations, all Entirely is a Plant of Divine Love. Death
is the Ripening of the whole Plant all over into the Perfect Fruit of Pure
Love, of Finishing Love. In this Form It can be seen, felt, tasted no
more but by the Pure Eyes, Embraces, and Mouth of Divine Love. God hath
<hi>also given us the Earnest of his Spirit</hi> for this. Tell me now you, who have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Spirit; What do you see, what do you feel, when you are blessed from
on high with any fresh Anointing, any fresh Effusion of the Spirit upon you?
When the Activity of Grace, when the Operations of the Divine Life are height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in you by any peculiar Appearances, and Outshinings of the Lord Jesus in
you; what do you Find? Do you not find <hi>all things made New?</hi> Do you not
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:49838:229"/>
find the Invisible Image of things within, the Image of all Visible things
without; Your self your Life, Your Soul, your Body, Your Graces, your
Comforts; Husband, Wife, Children, all Objects of Life, the whole World
itself renewing its Light, its Sweetness, its Lustre; All heightened, Spiritualised
Immortalized, transfigured into Divine Forms Invisible to all other Eyes, and
this without any Darkening, without any Eclipse, or Cloudy moment interposing.</p>
            <p>This is the Earnest of the Spirit given unto Thee for a Figure, a Foretast,
and a Seal of Thy change in Death.</p>
            <p>Thou shalt not be uncloathed of any Garment of Life, or Light; Spiritual,
or Natural, which thou hast ever put on. Thou shalt never be found naked
of any Forms of Light, Life, or Love, which have ever accompanyed, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
Thee.</p>
            <p>Thy Faith-shall be swallowed up into Vision; Clear, Full Immediate Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Eye to Eye; Thy Hope into Entire Possession, and Compleat Fruition;
thy Soul itself into a Simple Divinity and Eternity.</p>
            <p>Thy Body; thy Dear Relations; the Delights of thine Eyes; the Precious,
and Pleasant things of thy Senses shall All be cloathed upon from above with
those Immortal Substances, of which here they are the Shadows; with their
own Original Forms, of which here they bear the Figure; with their Flourishing
Patterns upon the Mount of Glory, in that First, and Pure Spirit, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Life, the shining Fountain of Good; in the Glorified Person of the
Lord <hi>Jesus;</hi> in Eternity.</p>
            <p>The Movable Tabernacle with its Tent, both are Dissolv'd, and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Eternal Building of Glory in the Heavens; where they become, as My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
Figures of Divinity, in that Temple; or Rich Furniture, &amp; Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Apartments of that Palace; where every Part beareth the Figure; posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Life, and Beauty of the Whole.</p>
            <p>This is the Freedom, the Sweetness, the Fulness of the Finishing Love of
God in <hi>Christ.</hi> Death itself is made at once A Consummation of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
Love between the Heavenly Bridegroom, &amp; his Bride; A Bed of Loves;
the Divine Embraces of Eternal Love; and the Divine Fruitfulness of these
Embraces.</p>
            <p>Jesus in his Invisible, and Eternal Form descendeth, overshadoweth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth
his Bride; transfigureth her into a Form of Eternal Beauties perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answering his own; maketh her to spring with, to bring forth in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those embraces, in the moment of her own Transfiguration all Forms
of Things above, and below in Immortal, Divine Images, and Essences of
Pure, Perfect Love.</p>
            <p>The Dark, aud Dreadful Appearances which surround Death, are onely
A Cloud, which hide these Delightful, these sacred Mysteries and changes
from all Natural Eyes; while the Saint himself in the Spirit seeth its own
Beauties, feeleth its own Joys in these Transfiguring, and Impregnating Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces:
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:49838:230"/>
So <hi>Christ</hi> himself, was taken by a Cloud out of the sight of the Apostles
while he ascended.</p>
            <p>Death beginneth to the whole Saint in all parts that Coming down of the
Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in a Flame of Glory; that Rapture of a Saint caught up into the
Bosom of the Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> with the Sound of the Heavenly Trumpet: The
Universal Shout of Divine Lives, Loves, Glories, thorow all things. The
Resurrection finisheth them. O the Absoluteness of <hi>Finishing Love!</hi> All
work of Glory is made perfect in a Saint: <hi>Jesus</hi> in all these Powers and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the God-Head resteth upon a Saint then, when he is weakest, when he
seemeth nearest, likest to Darkness, Dust and Dung, in the Agonies of Death.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Comfort; Against the last Day.</hi> There are peculiar Terrours accompany
the <hi>Day of Judgment.</hi> It is indeed the most Dreadful of all Dreadful things.</p>
            <p>The Last Day is twofold; 1. <hi>Universal,</hi> the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> upon the
whole Earth. 2. <hi>Particular;</hi> the day of the <hi>Lord</hi> upon a City or Nation.</p>
            <p>Both these are spoken of mixtly. The same dreadful things are attributed to
both; <hi>properly,</hi> or <hi>figuratively.</hi> We know not how near the <hi>Universal Day</hi>
of the <hi>Great Judgment</hi> of the Lord upon the whole Earth may be. The Lord
<hi>Jesus</hi> may be now at the Door, and ready to enter. He shall come as a Thief
in the Night, in Clouds, unperceived, unexpected. All things shall be in the
moment of his Appearance, as from the Beginning: Some at the Mill, some
in the Field, some in the Market, some at Church to be married, others
in the Marriage bed, others Eating and Drinking. All the signs which are to
fore-run that Great Day of the Lord's Last Appearance from Heaven, may be
come to pass in the midst of us in another manner and form, differing from
that, which we figure to our selves, and we not aware of it: As <hi>Elijah</hi> the
great fore-runner of our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> in his first Appearance was come and
gone in the Person of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> not understood either by the <hi>Jews</hi> in
general, or by the <hi>Disciples.</hi> Watch and pray; have your Loyns ever girt,
your Lamps burning; go forth from the things of Sense into the Spirit,
to meet the Lord, who cometh in that Air of Heaven, and Eternity. So shall
you be caught up to meet him, as he cometh, and enter with him into the
Bride-chamber.</p>
            <p>I shall give you my Reasons, which make me to believe, that the <hi>Particular
Day of the Lord</hi> upon this Land and City approacheth, and cometh like a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,
like an Armed Man upon us.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> seem to be set up for a <hi>Type</hi> to every City and
Land, which beateth the Name of God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> at large in the 11th to the
<hi>Romans</hi> describeth the Succession of the Gentiles by Christianity into the place
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Progress and Way of God with the External Professors of the
Gospel, as with <hi>Israel.</hi> He representeth this by Natural Branches cut off from
and Olive Tree, by wild Branches ingrafted in their place, standing upon the
same Terms, in the same danger of being cut off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="431" facs="tcp:49838:230"/>
2. Are not we, as <hi>Hierusalom,</hi> ripe for the Harvest? Have we not
had the Ministry of the Law, of the Gospel, of the Letter, of the Spirit, in
great power, and glory? Have not all varieties of chastisements, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
inferiour to, preparatory for the great, and last Judgment, already passed
upon us? Have not our Sins among all sorts, of all kinds, grown up to matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to be ready for the Sickle?</p>
            <p>3. We have seen <hi>signs</hi> in Heaven above, and on the Earth beneath, and in
the Waters; which <hi>Jesus</hi> Christ foretelleth, as <hi>Joel</hi> before, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
from him, to precede immediately the great and dreadful day of the
Lord upon <hi>Hierusalem. Hierusalem</hi> is in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, O what comforts flow from the <hi>finishing love</hi> of God in <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to
make this day of the Lord not only supportable; but lovely to us, and
longed for by us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lift up your heads, for your redemption is at hand;</hi> your Redeemer cometh.
This is the day of <hi>finishing love. Jesus Christ</hi> cometh in this day to thee, O
Believer, to consummate the Marriage, and so all thy joys, thy graces, thy g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in thy compleat Marriage to himself. The <hi>day of the Lord</hi> is said to be;
<hi>The Revelation of the Lord from Heaven.</hi> As the natural day chaseth away the
shadows of the night; but is the brightness of the Suns beautiful, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Body, making all things new in the pleasantness of his light to those Eyes,
that watch for the morning: so is this <hi>day of the Lord</hi> a day of Clouds,
and Darkness to the Children of the night. But it is to thee, who lovest, and
waitest for the appearance of our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> the breathing forth of all fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
loves, the breaking forth of all finished Beauties from the beloved Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of thy <hi>Jesus,</hi> appearing nakedly in all the glories of the God-Head <hi>from
Heaven,</hi> in thy Person, in all things round about thee; as the Sun of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
at once shining in every point of things, making a new day of immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and glory every where.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> cometh indeed <hi>in flames of Fire.</hi> But these <hi>flames</hi> are the
Almighty powers, and Supream glories of the eternal spirit, of eternal love
in its purity, in its simplicity. These are of a truth <hi>flames of fire</hi> to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
to the enemies, to all flesh: but they are to thee, who livest in the spirit,
<hi>flames</hi> of <hi>finishing love,</hi> of finished beauties presenting themselves to thee in all
forms of things; feasting themselves upon thee; feasting themselves with thee;
making themselves a feast to thee.</p>
            <p>I will conclude with that History of <hi>Elijah, 1 Kings</hi> 19. 11. There passed
before him a <hi>Whirlewind</hi> rending the Rocks, removing the Mountains; a
<hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Earthquake.</hi> After these came a <hi>still veice.</hi> The learned <hi>Jews</hi> say;
That all this was acted before the Prophet in a divine vision; that the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
the Mountains, the Rocks torn in pieces; the Fire, the Earthquake
were Angels presenting themselves in those Forms, as so many Divine Scenes
that the still voice were all the Angels in a Quire, making a heavenly melody;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:49838:231"/>
Thy Royal Bridegroom cometh in every day of Judgment to make more
than this, true to thee, O thou Dove, thou Bride of the Lamb. He cometh in
the weakness of all flesh round about thee, to rest upon thee, upon all things
round about thee in the power of his finishing loves. This is the great day of
love, and of the spirit, in which he will make perfect the strength of his love,
and spirit, while thou art trembling, while all things are falling with a great
noise round about thee, as dreadful ruines in a devouring flame.</p>
            <p>Now lift up thy head into that living, and glorious light of the eternal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
now lift up thine Eyes, and thine heart unto that living, and glorious light
of divine love, which breaketh forth from the face of thy <hi>Jesus</hi> within thee,
without thee, on every side of thee.</p>
            <p>This is the day of the anointing of thine Eyes with the heavenly Eye-salve;
of changing thee, and the whole world to thee into fine Gold, Gold
tryed in the fire.</p>
            <p>All things now appear to thee, as indeed they are, a divine vision in a light
of Glory. The whirlewinds, Earthquakes, Fires, Deaths, Ruines are all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Scenes in the Spirit. In them all thou seest the Dances, thou hearest the

            <p>Thus finishing love maketh perfect the light, the life, the strength of the

The glorified Person of <hi>Christ</hi> is a spiritual Garden. Indeed it is a
Garden invisible, sealed up from the outward senses. But by how much the
more invisible it is; it is so much the more real, glorious, and divine. This
Garden is ever present before thee. It flourisheth in the midst of thee. It is
continually open to every humble, believing Spirit.</p>
            <p>In this Garden all kinds of divine love grow, as so many flowers, which are
ever full-blown, ever in their full beauty, and sweetness, ever fresh, never fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
never failing. As fast as one is gathered, another springeth up in its
room. These Immortal flowers of divine love grow here for thee. They have
thy name written upon them. They bend and bow themselves towards thee.
They invite thy hand to gather them. They are ripe in every season, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
with the least touch of thy spirit. Thou, who hast a Spirit black,
and burning with the deepest guilt, take the flower of justifying love, stick it
in thy bosom. This will take out all the heat of pain, and take away all the
deformity, and stain from thy spirit.</p>
            <p>Thou who labourest under the disease of any corruption. See here the
flower of sanctifying love. Carry this in thine hand, in thine heart. It is a
powerful, a pleasent remedy against every lust, or passion. Doth the Instabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of thy spirit, the uncertainty of thy spiritual condition afflict thee? The
flower of electing love hath a soveraign vertue in it to establish, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Eyes, and infuseth strange joy into the heart. It breatheth forth
a sweetness from it, which will make you think your self in Paradise, or kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

thee, attending upon thee, as the heir of God; Jesus in glory walking with thee

               <head>The State of a Saints Soul and Body in Death.</head>
               <p>THe peculiar consolations, and joys of Death to a Saint, pour forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
into ten distinct channels, or streams.</p>
               <p>1. Death is no dissolution to the Soul, or Body of a Saint, but a restitution
and return of both to liberty, peace, and perfection.</p>
               <p>2. Both descend no more, but ascend in Death.</p>
               <p>3. Death hath in it no melancholy overcast, or unpleasant darkning to the
Soul or Body; but a sweet, unexpected, surprising, and ravishing increase of a
pure, divine, and triumphant light, circling in, and shining through all.</p>
               <p>4. Death casts no deformity upon either part of a Saint, but cloaths both
with an heavenliness, amiableness, and beauty.</p>
               <p>5. Death is no streightning, or imprisonment to Body, or Soul, but a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
enlarging of both to a divine state, and freedom.</p>
               <p>6. The Death of a Saint hath nothing bitter in it; but is a spring of pure
sweetnesses, and pleasures dividing itself into every part, and making all the
garden of God.</p>
               <p>7. There is nothing of the Devil in the Death of a Saint; but Christ ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
and glorified is all, fills all, and shines thorow all.</p>
               <p>8. Death hath nothing of wrath in it; but is all divine love unvailing it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>9. There is nothing of Death in the Death of a Saint; but life, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
unclouded, and shining forth clearly.</p>
               <p>10. Death is no other thing to a Saint than a heightning of his spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:49838:232"/>
making him all thorough-out spiritual, purely spiritual, without any mixture
unchangeably spiritual without any interruptions, inconstancies, or darkintervals.</p>
               <p>1. Death is no dissolution to the Soul, or Body of a Saint, but a restitution
and return of both to liberty, peace, and perfection. 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. 1. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> expresseth this ground of confidence, and joy in Death: For we know,
that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building
of God, an house not made with hands eternal in the Heavens. It is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of learned Divines, that the Greek word here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which we

                  </gap>Inn, from that circumstance of
unloosing the Horses, and taking them out of the Waggon, or Chariot to
bring them into the Inn, and Stable, that there they may be at their liberty to
rest, and feed, and lie down. From this word upon this ground, an Inn, or
House of reception, &amp; refreshing for Travellers, hath its name in Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>At our Birth, which is the morning of this life, and our entrance upon our
Journy through this weary world, our Souls and Bodies are joyned to this flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Image by the natural spirit, the spirit of this world, as Horses put into a
Waggon, to which they are fastned by their Harnes, and Traces. The Body
is as the fore-horse, but the Soul as the filler, which draws most, and bears the
chief weight, All the day long of this life we draw this Waggon heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with all sorts of temptations, and troubles thorow deep ways of mire,
and sand. This only is our comfort, that the divine will, which is love itself
in its perfection, as a hand put forth from Heaven thorow a Cloud, at our
Birth put us into this Waggon, and governs us all the day. In the evening of
our life, at the end of our Journey Death is the same divine will, as a naked
hand of pure love shining forth from an open heaven of clear light, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
taking our Souls, and both Bodies out of the Waggon, and Traces of this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leshly Image, and Spirit, and leading them immediately into their Inn, into a
place of freedom, rest, and refreshing into the unity of the eternal spirit into
the Bosom of our Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But before I proceed any farther, I will indeavour to make my whole
way more clear by answering an objection, which perhaps already ariseth in
most of your thoughts. You may be ready to say; Is this your meaning, as
you seem clearly to express it, that the Bodies also of the Saints suffer no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
in Death, but return immediately to a state of purity, and perfection?
This seemeth to contradict the common sense of all, the faith of the Saints, and
the plain letter of the Scriptures. Do we not with our Eyes see every day the
dead Bodies of the best Persons thrown into the Grave, turning to Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Putrefaction, either before, or in the Grave, dissolved to Worms,
and Dust, their bones scattered, and cast up and down Church-yards? The
blessed Body of our Lord Jesus was taken off from the Cross, a bloody, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
mangled Corps, a sad, and ruthful spectacle. So he was laid in the Grave,
the same Body, which after three days rose again, and was taken up into Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:49838:233"/>
The Scripture plainly testisieth, that in Death, as the Spirit returns to God
who gave it, so the dust returns to the Earth as it was, God passeth this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death upon <hi>Adam</hi> for his transgression: Dust thou art, and to dust
thou shalt return. Do not we by faith, grounded upon the clear letter of the
Scripture expect the Resurrection of our Bodies, at the sound of the last
Trumpet?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer to these objections first in general. I fully assent to all these testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of sense, of the letter of the Scriptures, &amp; of the common faith of all the
Saints concerning the Resurrection of the Body. Yet is it true that I mean
this, I believe this, in this meaning and belief my Soul, and Body rejoice, and
triumph together; that not the Soul alone, but also the Body of a Saint in the
very first moment of Death, meeteth with no dissolution, but a restitution,
and most delightful return to liberty, peace, and perfection: This is that sweet,
and comfortable sense of Death, which the holy Spirit seemeth to have sealed
upon my Soul, from all principles of reason, of Faith, and from the letter of the
Scriptures. In this sense I wish, that all were, as I am, to behold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the
same spiritual Eye in the same light of the Spirit, the beauty, and loveliness of
Death in the Body of a Saint, the beauty, loveliness, and pleasant life of
the Body of a Saint in Death.</p>
               <p>I come now to give a more particular answer fitted to the several objections
by four distinctions.</p>
               <p>The four distinctions are these. 1. Of a two-fold body in a Saint. 2. Of
a two fold Dust. 3. Of a two-fold Sense. 4. Of a two-fold Resurrection.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Dist.</hi> There is a twofold Body, which the Scripture in its language at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
to a Saint: There is a Body, from which a Saint is to be delivered.
You read of this, <hi>Rom. 7. l. Wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me
from the Body of this Death.</hi> There is a body in a Saint, which is to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of this in the name of all the Saints. <hi>Rom. 8. We also,
who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, wait for the adoption, the redemption
of the Body.</hi> There is a Body, which is the seat of Death, a Body of Death,
as in the forementioned place; who shall deliver me from the Body of this
Death? In all the members of this Body sin reigneth, as a King, establishing
his Law. For so, in the same place, a little before, it is written: <hi>With my
Members I serve the Law of Sin.</hi> This is the Body of Flesh, in which there
dwelleth no good, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in the same Chapter. There is again in a
Saint a holy, living, immortal Body, the seat of a holy, heavenly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Life, in as much as it is the Temple of the Holy Ghost For so St.
<hi>Paul</hi> testifieth, as to an unquestionable, and known truth, granted of all the
Saints in the primitive times, 1 <hi>Corin. 6. 19. What? know you not, that
your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost?</hi> Again, a Saint carryeth about
with him thorow his life a Body, which is a partition-wall between him, and
his Beloved, which divides between Christ and him, which he must break
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:49838:233"/>
forth from, and cast off, before he can be taken into the Bosom of Jesus Christ,
and be with him, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5, 6. 8. St. <hi>Paul</hi> complains that while he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the Body, he is absent from the Lord, and breaths forth passionate
longings to be absent from the Body, that he may be present with the Lord.
But a Saint hath a Body, which is so far from dividing him, and Jesus Christ,
that these two divine lovers are entirely united, and both one in it. It is
Christs own Body, as well as a Saints. All the Members of it are the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ, as they are of a Saint, 1 <hi>Corin 6. 15. Know ye not, that your
Bodies are the Members of Christ?</hi> shall I then take the Members of Christ,
and make them the Members of a Harlet? God forbid. Yea he carryeth this
union so high, that he maketh the Lord Jesus, and a Saint in this Body of his,
of which alone he speaketh, to be one Spirit, and makes that the principal
ground, upon which he builds his arguments against Fornication, <hi>v.</hi> 16. 17,
18. <hi>What? know ye not, that he, which is joyned to a Harl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, is one body, for
two,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall be one flesh, but he that is joyned unto the Lord is one Spirit.</hi>
Flee Fornication, he that committeth Fornication, sinneth against his
own Body. How manifestly here are a fleshly Body, and a spiritual Body
distinguished one from another? A Body, in which Forn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cation makes the
Man one flesh with the Harlot? a Body, in which a Saint is one Spirit with
Jesus Christ?</p>
               <p>These two are one Body, which standeth in two mixed Principles, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
The Body of a Saint, while this life lasteth, standeth partly in a
carnal, or fleshly principle, and Image. This is the Body of Death, in which
no good dwels, which is subject to the Law of Sin. While a Saint is present
in this Body, he is absent from Christ. This is that, from which a Saint groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to be delivered. The Body of a Saint standeth in part, and imperfectly,
while we live here, in a Spiritual Principle, and Image. Thus the Body of a
Saint is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, the Body, and Member of Christ,
one Spirit with Christ, by which one Spirit it is Baptized into his Spiritual,
and heavenly body. This is that body of a Saint, which groaneth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,
and delivered from the Body of Death, as from its Captivity, Prison,
and Grave.</p>
               <p>The Death of a Saint finisheth this Captivity, breaketh open the Prison,
and the Grave, and setteth free the Body of a Saint into the liberty of its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption
or Sonship; that is, into its Spiritual, and divine form of a Son of God.</p>
               <p>As fire is said to separate things of different kind, and to gather into one
things of the same nature: so is the Death of a Saint the flame of God, the
fire of Divine Love, Jesus Christ coming in the invisible flame of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
fire to separate the fleshly Principle, and Image from the spiritual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and Image, both in the Soul, and Body of a Believer. The fleshly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and Image, which is in the Body of a Saint, as a foreign, and strange
thing, as rust upon Gold, is entirely cast off to the Spirit, and Image of this
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:49838:234"/>
world, and of the Devil, to which it belongeth. The Body of the Saints in
its Spiritual Principle, and Image, which are truly, and properly its own, in,
which it is truly, and properly itself, is intirely for ever gathered up into the
unity of the Eternal Spirit, the heavenly Body, and Bosom of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</p>
               <p>In the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews, ch.</hi> 9. 23. The Blood of Lambs, and Goats
were said to cleanse the figures of heavenly things in the Tabernacle, but the
Blood of Christ the heavenly things themselves. The Soul, and Body of a
Believer are the heavenly things themselves. For these are that true Temple of
the Holy Ghost, of which the first Tabernacle, and Temple were figures. As
the death of a Saint is a conformity to Christ, and a fellowship to Christ on
his death: so doth the Blood of Christ, that is, the divine virtue, and the
life of the God-Head in the death of Christ, cleanse these heavenly things, the
Soul and Body of a Saint at his death from all their dust, rubbish, and filth,
from all mixture with the fleshly Principle, and Image.</p>
               <p>Thus now the Body of a Saint, as well as his Soul, is made compleatly a
pure, and heavenly Temple of the Holy Ghost. It subsists alone in an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
entire, and mutual union with this blessed Spirit. It lyeth wholly in it,
as in the Fountain of life, immortality, love, peace, and joy. It is filled with
it, as the Temple with the smoak of the sweet incense, and with the Glory of
God.</p>
               <p>How unhappy are you? How bitter is death, how full of deformity, how
dreadful, how dark, how dismal to you, who leave this life before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Eternal Life hath opened itself in you? Death to you is a devouring
fire from below, which burns upon your Spirit, and flesh, consuming the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the beauty, the sweetness of both, and changing them into a ruinous heap
of utter darkness, desolation and confusion.</p>
               <p>But blessed are you, thrice blessed are you, whose Souls, and Bodies are both
married by one Spirit unto Jesus Christ, before Death comes to separate them
one from another; whose Souls, and Bodies are become Temples of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, and are inhabited by the Holy Ghost, before Death comes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molish
the fleshly frame, and building. Death to you is a lovely form, it
which your Jesus himself comes into your whole Person, both Soul,
and Body, as into his Garden or Vine-yard, to drive out the wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out the Weeds, every thing of this worlds, of a fleshly Spirit, and
Image, that the Divine Shades, the Spiritual Plants, the fruitful
Vine of his own Life, and Love, and of his own heavenly Image may alone
flourish here, and himself alone may delight himself in the midst of these, as in
a Garden shut up. Jesus Christ comes by Death to your Bodies, and Spirits, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>

which polluteth it, that he may see his own face clearly all over it, that he alone
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:49838:234"/>
may drink of it, that he may lye in the midst of these waters for ever bathing
in them, that you in both may be a fountain sealed up to himself. Death is to
you, who believe, a rich Marriage-bed of Gold and Purple, into which your
naked Souls and Bodies quite stripped in the twinkling of an eye, of all their

               <p>2 <hi>Dist.</hi> The 2. Distinction next to this of the twofold Body in a Saint, is that of
the twofold dust in Death. In the last chapter of <hi>Ecclesiastes, v.</hi> 7. we read
<hi>That in Death the dust shall return to the earth as it was, and the Spirit to God
who gave it. Gen. ch.</hi> 3. 17. God passeth this Sentence of Death upon <hi>Adam</hi>
after the Fall: <hi>Thou shalt return to the Ground. For out of it thou wert taken,
Dust thou art, and to Dust thou shalt return.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was a Dust before the Fall, out of which the Body of Man was made,
<hi>Gen. 2. 7. God formed man of the dust of the ground.</hi> First observe here by the
way, that the ground from which the dust was taken, of which the Body of
Man was formed, was the ground of Paradise. For so we read immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at the 9th <hi>v.</hi> That out of the ground God had made to grow every Plant
that was pleasant to the eye, and good for food, with the Tree of Life in the
midst of them.</p>
               <p>The Jewish Doctors teach us, that the dust, of which the Body of Man was
made, was a fine and precious powder, in which all the excellencies of the
whole Creation were exactly tempered, and mingled together in one Body.
The Scripture seemeth to give us a foundation for this belief. When <hi>Moses</hi>
saith, That God made out of the ground to grow every Plant pleasant to the
Eye, good for food, and the Tree of Life in the midst of them; he seemeth to
signifie that this was a divine ground, in which God from the beginning had
sown the divine seeds of all the beauties, pleasantnesses, sweetnesses, and of all
the beautiful and pleasant Lives of Paradise itself, and of the whole Creation,
as it was in a Paradisical state. The dust then of this ground, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
the Body of Man, was the manifold beauty, sweetness, virtue and life
of Paradise, of the whole Paradisical state of things gathered together, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
themselves into one, and shading themselves, like the beauties,
sweetnesses, and virtues of a flower in its precious seed. But that which is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be considered here, is the state of all things before the Fall. Sin was not
yet entred, which brought in Death. The Unity of the Creature among
themselves, between God and the Creatures, was yet entire. The divine life
and Image flourished thorow the whole Creation. All the Creatures stood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their divine root, and were filled with a divine Sap, like flowers upon their
stalks, and trees at the height of the Spring.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> gives us a sweet, and beautiful Image of the whole Creation in
its first state before it lost its life, sweetness, and unity by Sin, <hi>Joh. 1. 3, 4.
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:49838:235"/>
All things were made by him, that is, Jesus Christ, and without him nothing was
made that was made. In him was life, and that life was the light of Men.</hi>
There are two things observable in this Scripture. 1. That which we read,
without him was nothing made, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifieth properly nothing was
made apart, or separate from him. The Holy Spirit seemeth here to point out
the primitive union of the whole Creation, and all the distinct parts of it
with the Lord Jesus, the living Root, the glorious Head of all, and in all. 2.
Where we read; <hi>Without him nothing was made, that was made,</hi> this latter
clause, that was made, addeth nothing to the sense, and looketh like a vain
repetition. Some therefore place it at the beginning of the following verse,
and read it thus; that, which was made, in him was life. This describeth to
us the effect of that union. Jesus Christ put a life, a divine life into every
Creature by his union with it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> seemeth to relate to this Scripture,
and to confirm this living, beautiful, and Divine State of all the Creatures,
as they came forth from God, <hi>Colos. 1. 16. All things were made in him, all
things were made thorow him, unto him, and into him.</hi> v. 18. <hi>All things stood
together in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then the Dust, the Ground, the Earth, the Darkness in the pure
state of the Creation were made in Christ, were life in him, were made in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with Christ. They were made thorow Christ, as their mould, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.
They were made by Christ, as their Original pattern, as the immediate
power putting forth itself in them. They stood together with the rest of the
Creatures in the Divine Unity in Christ. Thus had this Dust, of which we
speak, a Divine life in it, a Divine Beauty upon it, a Divine Seed in it; this
life was the life of Christ, and so comprehended according to its kind, all
the lives and vertues of all the Creatures, and of Paradise. Its beauty was the
beauty of Christ, in which after the like manner all created beauties centred,
and met in one. Christ himself was the Seed in this Dust, and so not only the
excellencies, and virtues of the whole Creation, but all the uncreated Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Life, and Glory lay together shaded, and vailed within this Dust. But
their vail, and their shade was a living, beautiful, and pleasant Picture of
themselves, all filled with the sweet Odour of those hidden Ointments.</p>
               <p>I have one thing more to say to describe this Dust. Man, who was the last
days work, the comprehension, and perfection of the whole Creation, was
made in a shadowy Image of God. For so the word Image in the first of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
signifieth, and the Scriptures in their whole course testify. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all things came forth from God in an universal Darkness before the Light
of the first day.</p>
               <p>This Darkn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ss is remarkable in several eminent circumstances. 1. It was
cast forth immediately from the Divine Nature, and from the glorious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ to be a vail round about upon the Eternal Glory itself, and to
be a ground of the whole Creation. 2. It stood in an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>immediate union with
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:49838:235"/>
the Divine Nature, and the glorious Person of Christ, springing forth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from it, and depending immediately upon it. 3. The unsearchable riches
of the God-Head, and of Christ, with all the various Excellencies of the creatures
as they were in their eternal patterns and principles, lay hid together within
this shade. 4. Out of this ground did God make to spring all the creatures in
their primitive paradisical purity and pleasantness, being wrapt up here, as in
their first matter, and having their proper seeds sown here.</p>
               <p>Thus was this Darkness a shade indeed, but pure, indued with a Divine Life,
cloathed with a Divine beauty and lustre, bearing a Divine figure, breathing
forth a Divine sweetness, spread forth every moment fresh with a new lustre,
and sweetness from the Divine Nature, vailing within itself all the Joys and
Glories of God, Christ, Heaven and Paradise, and as it hides all these in its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
lying itself in the Bosom of Christ.</p>
               <p>Such is the Ground, such is the Dust of the Ground, and the Earth, out of
which the Body of Man was first taken, and into which the Body of a dying
Saint returns. Such is the Darkness of Death, that overshadows a Saints bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
like the Nights in Paradise. But there is this advantage now, that this pure,
primitive Dust and Darkness are heightened, have a new, and greater beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and sweetness by the Resurrection of Christ from the Dead. This is the
first Dust, the Dust before the Fall.</p>
               <p>2. The second Dust is that after the Fall understood in that sentence; <hi>Dust
thou art, and to Dust thou shalt return.</hi> This is the Dust of that Death which sin
brings forth, a cursed Dust, the Dust of the cursed Earth, which bringeth forth
Bryars and Thorns. That former beautiful and blessed Dust lies captivated in
this, as in a Prison, or Grave of contrariety and enmity. This Dust is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of three things; 1. A Separation, Dissolution, and Desolation, from the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orce and power of Enmity. 2. A Blackness of Darkness from a cloud and
storm of wrath. 3. The seeds of shame, pain, anguish, horrour and torment
hidden in it.</p>
               <p>This Dust is that which the Body of a Saint casts off in Death, upon this
worldly Image and Spirit, together with the Spirit and Image of this world.
This is that which suffereth dissolution, which representeth deformity, and
striketh the horrour in Death. All which are now of the Image of this world,
and to the Image of this World, in the Spirit of this World, and to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of this World, within the Kingdom of the Devil, having no more relation
to a Saint in Death, than the filthy raggs of a Prince in a Dangeon, to the
Prince at Liberty, and in his Pallace.</p>
               <p>Death rubbing off the Rust of this cursed Dust from the Body of a Saint,
leaves it all a shining, rich, incorruptible Dust of pure Gold. His Body is
now entirely with Christ, a precious, pleasant, and living Dust in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Beds,
the Beds of Spices or perfumed Flowers in Paradise. This is the
second Distinction of the two Dusts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:49838:236"/>
3 <hi>Dist.</hi> The third distinction is of a twofold sense, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6. St. <hi>Paul</hi>
teacheth us, <hi>That to be carnally minded is Death, but to be spiritually minded is
Life, and Peace.</hi> The Greek runs thus: the mind of the flesh, and the mind
of the spirit. The word mind is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifieth a practical under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and comprehendeth a twofold act; one of the understanding to
dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rn, and judge; another of the will to tast, and rellish. So the mind is
here a sense, and a favour both in one. Thus you have here a twofold sense,
Spiritual, and Carnal or Fleshly.</p>
               <p>1. The Spiritual sense is set forth three ways. 1. By the Principle. 2. By
two effects of this Principle. 3. By two companions of these effects.</p>
               <p>1. The Principle of a Spiritual sense is the Spirit; this holy, and blessed
Spirit is the only, and proper Principle of a Saint, and Saintship, of a Son
of God, and a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ship to God. Art thou indeed a Saint? then thou art in the
Spirit of Glory, and of God, as in thy Root, and Element, as a Tree of Life
in the Root of Eternal Life, and Love, as Fishes in the water of Life, as
Birds in the pure air of Divine Love, as Angels in Heaven, <hi>Rom. 8. 9. You
are not,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Saints) <hi>in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Flesh, but in the Spirit.</hi> Art thou
indeed a Son of God? Then is this Spirit of Grace, and Immortality in
thee, as thy natural Principle, as the power of Nature according to the new,
and Divine Nature which acteth thee. <hi>Rom. 8. 16. As many as are led by
the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God.</hi> The word led is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> acted. As the
Soul acts the Body, as the principle of reason the Soul of Man, as the nature
of the Sun acts the Sun in its shinings, in its motions; thou also art acted by
the Divine Spirit, to which the Sun, the Soul of Man, the principle of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
are empty, and weak shadows, so far as thou in truth art a Child of Light,
and a Son of God the Father of Lights.</p>
               <p>Let me here by the way touch a three-fold string in your Souls. 1. A
mournful string. 2. A string of desire. 3. The string of praise.</p>
               <p>1. Is the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>it the principle of a Saint? how then should we mourn, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
this Spirit of Grace, this Comforter is grieved, that this Spirit of Light, and
Life is quenched by unbelief, sensuality, unkindness, and neglect? how should
we mourn that this Holy Spirit, this Spirit of Truth is slighted, and spoken
evil of, as a Spirit of licentiousness, or as a fancy, and delusion, and all this
among Saints, at least in profession, when as this Spirit is the only principle of
Saintship? St. <hi>Jude</hi> in his Epistle, speaketh of this as the Sin of Devils, for
which they are cast down to Hell, and bound in Chains of Darkness, that they
did forsake their first state, and their own habitation. It is in Greek not their
first state, but their first principle, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. O Saints is not this a Sin, greater than
that of Devils, not only to forsake, but to grieve, and cast shame upon this
first, and most blessed Spirit, which is your only principle, a principle of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Life, Light, and Purity; your own habitation, a habitation of Divine
Rest, and Glory?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:49838:236"/>
2. O all you, who desire to be Saints, or to grow in the new, and Divine
Nature of a Saint; let your hearts burn by day, and by night with continual
longings for the Spirit. This alone is that of which a Saint is bred, by which
he is nourished. This alone is the Heavenly Root, the Sap, the sweet Dew,
Showers, and Influences, the warm, and cherishing Sun-shine to every Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Plant, Cry therefore, and wait for this Spirit; wait upon it; minister to
it; seek it; suck it in by all means, thorow all its own manifestations, and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
of Nature, or of Grace. When this world was first made a beautiful frame out
of a dark Deep, the Spirit moved upon the face of the waters. When Jesus
was conceived in the womb of the Virgin, the Holy Ghost overshadowed her,
and rested upon her. In both places the expressions seem to allude to a Bird, or
a Dove spreading itself over its Nest to hatch its young Ones. When the
Lord Jesus was Baptized, the Holy Ghost descended, and rested upon him in
the form of a Dove. Dost thou indeed desire to have thy dark, defiled, dead
heart made a new Creature, to have Jesus Christ to be born, or to grow
within thee, and to be Baptized yet more, into Jesus Christ the Sea of all
Heavenly Beauties, Loves, and Joys? O then pray to the blessed Spirit to
make thy Soul his Nest, to move upon the face of thy Spirit, to overshadow
thee, to descend and rest upon thee in his Dove like form.</p>
               <p>3. O all ye Saints, sing the praises of the holy Spirits let the high praises of the
holy Spirit be ever in your mouths. Say to the Spirit; this is the womb of
Divine Life and Power, which hath born us, and brought us forth to be
Children, and Heirs to God; these are the Breasts of Divine Life, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which give us suck; this is itself, the Heavenly Milk of the Eternal
word, by which we live, and grow. Do you see any glympse of Evangelical
Light, and Truth, do you feel any workings of Grace, any sweet springings
of Love and Joy? Give Glory to the Spirit, it is this blessed Spirit, which now
shines in you, enlivens you, and acts you. The Children of <hi>Iracel</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
in a great want of water, met with a Well, then they sang to it in
these words, <hi>Spring O Well, the Princes have digged it with their S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aves.</hi> When
ever thou meetest with any fresh stream, any sweet drop of the water of Life
rising up within thee in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s parched Land, and weary Wilderness, sing to thy
Well, sing to the blessed Spirit, and say in thy Song: my Well springeth, my
Jesus hath digged it in my heart with the Golden Scepter of his Grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and
Love. Thus let every gracious thought, gracious moving of thy mind, will, or
affections put into thy mouth a new Song of joyful praises to the Spirit, as the
dear, and inseparable principle of Life, of Heaven, of Eternity within thee,
thine own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> principle. Thus much of the Principle.</p>
               <p>2. The two effects of this Principle are a Spiritual sense, &amp; savour both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in that expression: to be heavenly minded. How often doth my
Spirit labour in the Bosom, and power of the Eternal Spirit for these two
things, 1. That all Men were brought forth into this Spiritual Principle. 2.
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:49838:237"/>
That all, who have the Spiritual Principle within them, were continually
acted by it! How sweet would life be to them, for the sight of their Eyes, and
rellish of their Spirit? They that live in the Spirit, see all things by a Spiritual
Light, It is indeed a pleasant thing to behold this Light. Every glympse of
it infuseth a heavenly joy into the Heart, and scattereth all Clouds of grief,
or melancholy. These see all things in a Spiritual Image, that is in a Divine,
and Immortal Glory. They tast the sweetness of a Heavenly, and Divine
Love in every thing. Every thing presenteth itself to them in an Heavenly
Appearance, and every appearance of things entreth into their Souls with a
heavenly taste, and rellish, far sweeter than Hony to the Palate.</p>
               <p>All our converse with things of every kind of Nature, or Grace; of Sense,
or reason proceedeth from a union with those things in one Principle,
and is a communion with them in that Principle. Such as the Principle is,
such are the Appearances, and rellishes of things to us, such is our converse
with them. All Appearances of things to Men, or to Angels in every natural
Principle, to our senses, or to our understandings are no more than shadows,
or dreams. The Spirit alone is Truth. When melancholy forms, and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of things in this world afflict our Spirits; when the pleasant things here
lift them up to vain joys, and glories; if the holy Spirit awaken himself, and
arise in us: all these fly away, all other appearances of things break up into
an appearance of Eternal Beauty, and Blessedness springing forth from this
Spirit like the shadows of the night, when the Sun is seen, and a dream, when
a Man awaketh.</p>
               <p>We are taught by natural Philosopy, that the Images of things are seen
thorow a Christalline humor in the Eye, as a fine Glass. If this Christal be
dyed with any colour: all things, which we see, appear to us in that colour.
In like manner there is a native moisture upon our Palates, and Tongues, by
which we tast things. If this moisture have any tast of its own, every thing
tasteth of it. Blessed art thou, who livest the life of a Saint. Thou livest the
life of Heaven upon Earth. The Spirit is the Christal in the Eye of thy Soul,
thorow which thou seest all things. This Christal hath a heavenly colour of
Glory ever upon it. Thou then feest all things in this ravishing colour, in a
Heavenly Glory. The Spirit is the Divine moisture, and water of life upon
the pallate of thy Soul, by which thou tastest all things. This water of the
Spirit hath ever the heavenly rellish, the unexpressible sweetness of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, of the Divine Love, of the pleasures of the God-Head. Thus
thou savourest all things. This Love, and Sweetness thou rellishest in every thing.</p>
               <p>3. The two companions of these two effects of a Spiritual Principle are
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and Peace. <hi>To be spiritually minded is Life, and Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Life The Spirit, and Life are inseparable one from another. The
words that I speak, they are Spirit, and they are life, saith Jesus Christ, <hi>Joh. 6.
The Spirit is the Fountain of Life. For he is called the Spirit of Life,</hi> Rom. 8.
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:49838:237"/>
The Quickening Spirit. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. The Power of an Endless Life. <hi>Heb.</hi>
Let us ever pray, that we may ever live in the Spirit: For now we live, if
we stand fast in our spiritual Principle. The Life which we now live, is first,
pure. It hath nothing of any Mixture, of any Defilement, or of any shadow
of Death. Secondly, It is perfect. It hath all the Sweetnesses, Virtues, Joys, and
Beauties of Life in it. Thirdly, It is perpetual, It never ceaseth, It never
endeth, but springeth to Eternity. Fourthly, It is a powerful Life. It main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
itself against all the Powers of Darkness, and Death. It maintains
itself in the midst of them, as a sweet Light of Glory, shining in a
dark place, and triumphing over the darkness. In a word, this Life is the
purest, sweetest, and most lasting Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e: For it flows immediately, and springs
up continually from the Fountain of Life itself. Nay, which is far sweeter,
and more glorious, it is Life, as it lies in the Fountain of Life. It is Life not
only from the Spirit, but in the Spirit. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in this Chapter:
<hi>They that are in the Spirit;</hi> and to the <hi>Galatians; if ye live in the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The other Companion of a Spiritual Sense is Peace, Peace in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Scripture, signifieth a perfection of Happiness. It is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into, 1. Peace above with God. 2. Peace within, in your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
and Spirits. 3. Peace with all Creatures round about you. O how
true is it, that they keep the Feast continually, a Royal and Divine Feast in
white Garments, who live in a spiritual sense of things! Every day to them
is a Holy Day, a Festival Day. All things are festival round about them.
All things are in a Covenant of Peace with them, in a Covenant of Grace,
and Divine Peace. All appearances of things in every State shine upon them
from the glorified Person of Christ, as heavenly Beauties smiling upon them.
All Providences, Changings, and Motions of things, are a Heavenly Musick,
springing up to them, and sounding round about them, in the Unity of the
Spirit. All Impressions made upon their Souls from every passage of Providence,
or Change, is a most delicious sweetness upon their Spirits, an unexpressible
Taste of Heaven and Eternity.</p>
               <p>But the manner of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Expression is very observable, and hath a
great force in it: <hi>To be spiritually minded is Life and Peace.</hi> The sense and
favour of the Spirit is itself Life and Peace universally, absolutely, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract,
in perfection, without any Confinement or Allay. The spiritual
sense of a Saint, is the pure, and compleat Essence of Life and Peace in its
highest Activity. How true is it, that a good man is satisfied from himself?
How Holy, how High, how Happy, how Heavenly a thing is it to be a
Saint, to be spiritual, to live as a Saint, to live spiritually? Thou now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendest
all things in an uncorruptible Beauty, Love, and Joy in thy self,
as in Heaven: For all things are to thee thine own spiritual Principle, thine
own spiritual Sence, springing up and diffusing itself into all blessed Forms of
Glory, Delight, and Immortality within thee. Jesus Christ tells his Spouse
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:49838:238"/>
in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> That she is a Fountain of Living Waters flowing from <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon;</hi>
That she is a Fountain of Gardens; That all her Plants are Plants of
<hi>Paradise.</hi> O blessed Spirit, who livest in the Eternal Spirit, as thy Principle,
by which thou art inwardly acted! The Principle of thine is the Fountain,
the ground of Paradise within thee. All forms of things are Paradisical Plants,
at once pleasant to the Eye, good for Food, desirable, to fill thee with all the
most glorious Treasures of the Divine Wisdom. Thy Spiritual
Principle is the Divine Ground, out of which all these Plants of Paradise grow
up within thee, as thine own Plants. Thy spiritual Sense and Savour, is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Feeding and Feasting upon the Fruits of Paradise, which these Plants
continually bring forth.</p>
               <p>2. The Fleshly or Carnal Sense is also illustrated by three Circumstances.
1. The Principle. 2. The Effect of that Principle. 3. The Companion of that Effect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Principle of a Carnal Sense is the Flesh. It is expresly called the
Mind or Sense of the Flesh. The Flesh, the Natural Man, the Earthly Man,
the Spirit of man, the natural Soul in the Language of the Gospel, and most
of them in this present Chapter signifie the same Principle of a carnal Sense
of Sin, and of Death. Happy is he that is not here deceived. Every Earthly
Heavenly, Humane, Angelical Spirit, or Principle, however enlightened
sanctified, heightened by the work of the Spirit, below that Spirit which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
immediately born of the eternal Spirit, which is one Spirit with it, and live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

in it, is Flesh, and this Principle of a fleshly Mind, or Sense, or of Death.</p>
               <p>2. The Effect of this Fleshly Principle is Twofold: 1. A Carnal, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
Fleshly Sense. 2. A Fleshly, or Carnal, Savour. How unpleasant is thy Life,
who livest in this Principle for the sight of thine Eyes? The Light of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the Prince of this World is the Prince of Darkness. Thou measurest Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

the Humane Image, and rellish of things, springs from the Devil, as he is Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>3. The Companion of a Carnal Sense, and Savour, is Death: <hi>To be Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Death. 1. That Divine Image of things, which alone is the Truth, is Spirit
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:49838:238"/>
and Life, both the Paradises, the Heavenly, and the Earthly, as it is new
born, and united unto the Heavenly, lie captivated in a Carnal Mind, or
Sense, as in a Prison or Grave. 2. A Carnal Sense is that outermost Darkness,
which is without the new, and Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> 3. In a Carnal Sense
are disorder, confusion, and desolation, the dissolutions of all the ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of
Peace, Beauty, and Life. For these all consist in that order alone, which hath for
its band the Unity of the Spirit. 4. A Carnal Sense hath ever the sting of
Death in it. Fears, Cares, Grief, Pains, Anguishes, Torments never cease here.
They are the Worm which never dyes, the Fire, which never goes out, in
this region of the shadow of Death, a Carnal Mind, or Fleshly Sense.</p>
               <p>Naturalists tell us, that some Candles may be so made, that all the Persons seen,
by those lights shall appear as Ghosts one to another, or the whole place seem
full of Snakes, and dreadful Serpents. Such are those lights of a Carnal
Sense, by which all things are seen of thee, who art in a Carnal, Fleshly
State. Every thing of Truth, as it appears to thee, is an apparition from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
bearing Paleness, Terrour, Death, and Hell in the face of it. Thou canst
no where walk, sit, lie down in peace. All places, all States to thee are full of
Serpents, hissing, shooting out their forked stings, casting their poyson at thee.</p>
               <p>Wo to you, O ye Inhabitants of the Earth, ye, who dwell in a fleshly
sense of things. The Devil is ever in the midst of you with great rage; here
he is known by his name Satan, the Enemy, the Hater. But ye, O ye Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of Heaven who live in a Spiritual Principle, why are you ever found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad?
Why are not all your walks within in the Spirit, the heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
which God hath planted, and set you in to dress it, and to keep it, and
to eat of the fruits of it without any exception within your own Spirits? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold!
not a single Cherubim, but the whole Army of glorious Angels, with
the Presence, and Power of the Eternal Spirit, as a flaming Sword turning
every way, keeps the entrance into this Paradise, not to keep you out, but to
defend you in it by suffering no evil thing, none of the Powers of Darkness,
of Death, of Wrath, to enter here. While you are without in a Carnal Mind,
and Worldly Spirit, you are among the holes of the Foxes, the Dens of the
Lyons, and the Mountains of Leopards. All things, with which you converse,
ascend from below, from the Earth, from the natural Soul, and from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
as St, <hi>James</hi> teacheth us. All these three the Earth, the Natural Soul, and the
Devil are Links in the same chain of Darkness immediately fastned one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
The light, and breath of your life in the Spirit of this world is the
smoak from the Bottomless Pit. Your Beauties, your Joys, your pleasant
things are those Locusts sent forth from thence, mentioned in the Revelation,
with Faces, and Hair like Women, with Crowns upon their Heads, false
Shows of Sweetness, Softness, Greatness, and Glory, but stings, invenomed
stings, the stings of Death are in their tails. O! Retire into your own enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Gardens, there within your own enclosed Grounds, your own Souls, sit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:49838:239"/>
your own Fig-Tree, your own Vine, which are your own Spiritual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
out of which the universal Image of things both Heavenly, and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
springeth up into the perfection of all pure Beauties, and Joys with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.
Delight your selves under their shadows, where you are safe from
all Evil, and at rest for ever. I again testify unto you, as I have often, and
alwaies testified in all my Sermons, and Discourses, that there is no Salvation
to the flesh, or in the flesh. O then ye, who are yet found walking after the
flesh, give no rest to your selves here. Cry night and day without ceasing to
the Holy Spirit to take you up upon his Wings, and to translate you sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in a moment, out of this Wilderness of fiery Serpents into the promised,
and good Land flowing with Rivers of Milk, and Hony, the Milk of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Word, and the Hony of the Divine Wisdom, which both are Jesus
Christ, the Fulness, Sweetness, and Glory of the God-Head. O that these
words, as now you read, or hear them, in this very moment, thorow the power
of the blessed Spirit might be as the hands of Angels laid upon <hi>Lot,</hi> to hasten
you out of this Sodom of the flesh, while you linger here, into a place of safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the City of the living God in the secret of the Spirit, before the Lord rain
down fire from the Lord upon all Flesh.</p>
               <p>The profit, the pleasure, the seasonableness of this discourse hath carryed me
farther, &amp; stayed me longer upon it than my method seemed to require. Let us
now return to apply this distinction of a twofold sense, Carnal, and Spiritual to
our present purpose, which is to set forth the Beautiful, and Blessed Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> of
a Saints Soul and Body in Death. We have heard that a Spiritual sense is Life,
and Peace absolutely, universally, eternally, without mixture, confinement or
change; that all things here are in the purity, and perfection of Divine Life,
Beauty, and Joy. We have also heard, that the Carnal Sense is Death, as it
reigns entirely here, so it it is confined hither, shut up in this Pit, and without
this fleshly Principle hath no where any place.</p>
               <p>I shall bring this Distinction home to my purpose of making Death all over,
in every part lovely, and pleasant to a Saint, by two Propositions.</p>
               <p>1. Propos. This is the first. A Saint by dying is taken entirely in his whole
Person, Soul, and Body out of the Carnal, or Fleshly Principle, out of the
Fleshly Sense, and so out of Death.</p>
               <p>2. Propos. A Saint by dying is in his whole Person, Soul, and Body ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
up entirely into a Spiritual Principle, and so into the Immortality of a
Divine Life, Peace, and Delight.</p>
               <p>1. Propos. A Saint by dying is taken entirely in his whole Person, Soul,
and Body out of the Carnal, or Fleshly Sense, and so out of Death. I shall
open, and confirm this Proposition to you by two Scriptures.</p>
               <p>1. The first Scripture is the 1 Epistle of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 4. 1. Wherefore seeing
Christ hath suffered in the Flesh, let us also arm our selves with the same mind.
For he that hath suffered in the Flesh, hath ceased from Sin. The Holy Ghost
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:49838:239"/>
clearly relates to the death of the Lord Jesus, and of a Saint. He speaks of
the time perfectly past; he that hath suffered in the Flesh, that is, he that
by dying hath compleated, and finished his sufferings in the flesh, he hath cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from sin. He that dyeth in union with Christ in the vertue of his death,
and in a conformity to it, in the first moment of death ceaseth from all the
Evils of Sin, the Guilt, the Power, the Pollution, the Punishment, and so from
Death itself.</p>
               <p>See the inseparable connexion between the Flesh, Sufferings, Sin, and Death.
All these continue together, and cease together. O you, that hear or read, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
these things, and lay them to heart! This Flesh, which is so dear to
us, which we are so loath, and unwilling to part with, which we tender as our
nearest, and dearest self, is our only division from our self, a bed of Snakes,
and Enmity. It is the root, the seat, the food, the fewel, the fruit of Sin, and
suffering, and death. This Fleshly Principle, and Sense, this worldly Light,
and Image, which we account Life, and the Sweetness of Life, in which we
think all the dear Treasures and Joys of Life are comprehended, is no other,
than a deep, dark, and miery Dungeon, where we lie in the midst of the his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
stings, and poysons of innumerable Toads, and Serpents. This Sin,
which so easily besetteth us, and winds itself into our bosoms, is that weight,
which presseth us, and sinketh us down, that chain of Darkness, which tyeth
us down, and fastneth us here below in the horrible Pit, and Dungeon of this
Fleshly Principle, and Sense, this Fleshly, this worldly Spirit, and Image. This
Death which seemeth so dreadful to us, which we so tremble at, and fly from,
is that dearest Friend come down from Heaven, from the bosom of God,
that beautiful hand put forth from the secret of Eternal Life, Love, and
Glory, which taketh off this weight, which knocketh off this chain of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and restoreth to us our silver Wings, and golden Feathers, by which in a
moment we fly forth from this Cage of unclean Spirits, this Dungeon of the
Fleshly Principle, and Sense never to return into them any more.</p>
               <p>O Believers, fear not, fly not from Sufferings! Be willing to sacrifice and
offer up this Flesh, as a whole Burnt-Offering in the Flame of Sufferings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Death. Kiss Death as a lovely Bride, as those perfumed Flowers, those
Beds of Spices, the Cheeks of the Heavenly Bride-groom, mentioned in the
<hi>Canticles:</hi> For the Flesh, the fleshly Principle, and Sense, the Spirit and
Image of this Flesh, of this World, together with the Sufferings, Sin, and
Death, end all at once in the Death of a Saint, in the very first moment of
his Death.</p>
               <p>A Holy Divine, when he was dying, lay upon his Death-Bed, singing
this often over; <hi>Now I shall sin no more.</hi> We read <hi>Isaiah 59. 2. That our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
separate between us and our God, our Sins hide his face from us.</hi> Death is
indeed a separation, but it is not the separation of the Soul from the Body. The
separation of the Soul or the Body from God, this is Death indeed, this alone
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:49838:240"/>
is Death. This world, this worldly Spirit, and Image is the Curtain, or Vail,
the Partition wall between us and the Face, or Bosom of our Heavenly Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
our Lord Jesus. So saith St. <hi>Paul: Our Gospel is hid to those, whose
Eyes the God of this world hath blinded, that they should not behold the Light of
the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face, or Person of Christ.</hi> The
Fleshly Principle, or Sense is the unpassable gulf between us, and the unsear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable
Treasures of the Divine Nature, of the Blessed Persons in the Divine
Nature, the Father, the Eternal Word, the Holy Spirit. Sin digs up, and keeps
open this Gulf, sin builds up this Partition wall. Sin draws this Curtain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, and the Divine Beauties, the Divine Blessedness. O dying Saints,
break forth into singings! O all ye Saints rejoice, and triumph at every
thought, at every approach of Death! <hi>Abraham</hi> saw the day of Christ, and
rejoyced to see it, saith our Lord Jesus in the Gospel. The word rejoyce in Greek
is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, he danced a Galliard. When the Virgin Mary, with Christ
in her Womb, came to the Mother of <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, the Babe within her
sprung for joy. Thus O Believers let your hearts spring for joy within you at
the approach, and presence of Death. So Death coming to you as a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and a heavenly Virgin with Jesus Christ in its Womb, not after the Flesh,
but in the Glory of the Spirit, to be delivered of him immediately into your
Bosoms, as a Bridegroom that at once in the same moment appears to you in
Glory, makes you worthy of himself, by being like himself, and one Glory
with himself, makes all things Life, Immortality, &amp; Glory round about you. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the day of your Death both afar off, &amp; near at hand as the day of Christ, as
a day, which the Lord Jesus makes, rising himself, as the true Sun upon you, &amp; so
iurning this Sun into Darkness, before the brightness of his own appearance,
enlightning all within you, and, without you with another Light infinitely
greater, infinitely sweeter. At the sight of this day, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, so let
your hearts spring with a pleasant lightness, and dance Galliards in your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som.
Now sing of Death, and say in your songs every one of you, as you lie
upon your Death-beds: I shall sin no more, I shall be in Flesh no more, no
more for ever in this Fleshly Principle, and sense, which hath so long bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
me, and held me by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orceries in the House of Whoredoms, and of
Death. I shall be in this world so loathsome, and so hateful to me, I shall see
this world, and this Image of things, which hath been so long so tempting,
and tormenting to me, no more for ever. Farewel for ever all distances, all
divisions between me, and my Jesus, my God. Henceforth shall I with open
face in my Soul, and my Body behold the open, and unvailed Face of God.
Henceforth shall I with my naked Soul, and Body lie for ever in the naked Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of my Glorified Saviour, my King, and Husband, giving him of my
Loves, drinking in abundantly his Loves, and bringing forth continually by
him all the Spiritual, and Heavenly fruits of Life, and Immortality.</p>
               <p>The morning is called Rosy-fingred, because the morning Beams, as Rosy-fingers
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:49838:240"/>
seem to open the Curtains of the night, and let in day upon us. Death
is to a Saint of a truth this Rosy fingered morning, which by sweet beams
breaking forth from on high, draws aside the Curtains of this night of Flesh,
and lets in upon us the Eternal day, which at once in a moment overspreads
our Souls, and Bodies, and fills all things to us with its blessed Light, making
us, and all things new in the newness of its own Heavenly, and Immortal
Beauties.</p>
               <p>The second Scripture is, 2 <hi>Corin. 5. 6, 8. Therefore we are alwaies confident,
knowing, that whilst we are at home in the Body, we are absent from the Lord.</hi> We
are confident I say being willing rather to be absent from the Body, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with the Lord. Of what Body speaketh the Apostle here? What Body is
this, which thus divideth between the Spiritual Bride, and her Heavenly
Bridegroom, that a Saint cannot be present with both at once? If he be at
home in this Body, he must be absent from Christ, and a banished Person
from his Bosom. If he will be present with Christ, and enjoy him, he must
cast off this Body, and be absent from it.</p>
               <p>Is this the true, and proper Body of a Saint? How can that be? The true
Body of a Saint is as much himself, as his Soul is himself. He can be no
more absent from his own Body, than he can be absent from his Soul, or from
himself.</p>
               <p>We read in the same Chapter, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 6. Towards the latter end, that the
Body of a Saint is the Member of Christ, and the Temple of the Holy
Ghost. When <hi>St. Paul</hi> speaketh of a Body, from which we must be absent,
that we may be present with the Lord Jesus; sure he cannot mean this Body,
which is a Member of Christ, which is united to Christ, and implanted into
him. Can I be absent from Christ by being present with that Body, which is
a Member of him, a Member in him? Can I be absent from this Body, which
is a Member of Christ, while I am present with Christ? O Believers, be not
weary of living in the Body, only know your true selves, and your own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies!
while you live in these, you live in Heaven, and are ever with the Lord
Jesus. For your-Bodies are his Members, and so the fulness of him, who filleth
all in all. O Believers fear not to die, you part not with any thing, that is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
your selves, truly your own. You part not with your Bodies, nor with
any thing, in which they have any true propriety, or which hath any dear
Relation to them. For your Bodies are the Members of Christ, Baptized into
one Body with him by that one, and the same Spirit, which gathereth up all
things together unto him, and into one in him.</p>
               <p>Thy Body, O Believer, is the Temple of the Holy Ghost. When the
Spirit of God, and of Glory rests upon this Temple, he never removeth off
from it any more. When he enters into this Temple of his, he never goeth
forth, nor leaves it empty. This is his true Temple upon the true Mount
<hi>Sion,</hi> the Soul, and Body of a Saint, which he hath chosen for a resting place
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:49838:241"/>
for ever. O Saints have patience, and peace in life. For by being at, home in
your Bodies, you are in the Temple of the Holy Ghost, which he fills with
his Glory, where every thing utters Glory. O Saints have pleasure in Death.
For Death cannot divide your Bodies from you, nor the Holy Ghost from
your Bodies, which are his Temple. Can you ever be absent from Christ,
while you are present in your own proper Bodies, which are the Temples of
the Spirit of Christ? Can you by being present with the Lord Jesus be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from these Bodies of yours, which are the Temple of the Holy Spirit,
which is the highest band of Unity; the dwelling place of that Spirit, which
is one with the Lord Jesus? No certainly, this can never be. Thy Body O
Saint is ever, in life, and in death, filled, and overshadowed by the Holy
Ghost. When it seems to fall into the Dust, and Darkness of Death according
to the Carnal sense; then doth thy Heavenly Dove give to it according to the
Spiritual sense its own silver Wings, and golden Feathers.</p>
               <p>What then is this Body of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which
gives him a triumphant confidence in the face of Death, while it is his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
desire to be absent from this Body, that he may be present with Christ?
Is it not that Body of Death against which he cryeth out, <hi>Rom. 8. l. O
wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from this Body of Death?</hi> This
he calls also a little before in the same Chapter that flesh of his, that self, in
which there dwels no good. This is the Fleshly Principle, and Sense, the Spir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it,
and Image of this world, which is sprung up out of the Fall, which lies as
a disguise, and a cloud upon the true Person, the Soul and Body of a Saint.
What is not this the Body, which is the partition-wall between these two
Spiritual Lovers, Christ, and a Saint, while he lives here, which being cast off
in Death, they find themselves in the pure, beautiful, and naked Arms of each
other. What is Death now to a Saint? Is it not the power of the Divine life,
and love in a Saint breaking forth, and as it breaks forth, tearing off, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
up this disguise of Flesh? Is it not the power of a Divine Light, and
Glory breaking forth, and as it breaks forth, scattering, and blotting out the
cloud of this Body of Death for ever? How beautifully does the Body of a
Believer shine forth now in Death, as a naked Member of our glorified Jesus
cleansed from all its dust, and defilement, when it is taken up entirely out of
the fleshly Principle, and Sense? How beautiful, and glorious a Temple on
every side of it doth the Body of a Believer now appear in Death, when it
cometh entirely out of its Cloud by being entirely taken out of the Spirit,
and Image of this world? The true Body of a Saint lieth while this life last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
as in a Dungeon, or Grave. It stands here like the glorious Tabernacle
composed of the most precious materials, Silks, Silver, Gold, the choicest
Woods; wrought with all the richest colours, and the most curious Figures in
Needle-work, and Carvings of a Divine Workmanship, which stood in a vast,
and howling. Wilderness, covered with a Tent of Badgers Skins. O! how
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:49838:241"/>
pure, how precious, how beautiful, how divine a thing is the Body of a
Saint in Death, when it casts off this Body of Death, the corrupt, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Image, and Principle entirely, and is seen now no more for ever in any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
besides that alone of a naked Member in the most lovely, &amp; shining
Body of the Lord Jesus? With what sweetness, and beauty doth it
break forth now as a most amiable, and admirable Tabernacle of the
Eternal Spirit, when by death it casts off the Tent of Badgers Skins, with
all the darkning, and deforming impressions of Dust, and heat, and at
once passeth out of the Wilderness of this worldly Spirit, and form of
things unto the good Land of rest, and promise, by passing in a dry, and
flowry path thorow the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> that sweet, and blessed bound of
Death, between the dreadful desart, and heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give me leave here to drop upon your hearts four brief exhortations.</p>
               <p>1. O that all Men would love the King of Saints, the Lord Jesus. It is he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
who subdues the King of Terror, that is, Death, and is more, than a
conqueror over him, making him the King of delights. He changeth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and Kingdom of Death, which is the Principality of the Devil, into the
Kingdom of God, which is Righteousness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>2. Set a value upon the union with the Lord Jesus by faith. Ask, seek,
dig for this by day, and by night, in Prayer, in the Word, in the Society of
the Saints, in every ordinance, in every creature, that you may believe in the
Lord Jesus, and that you may be united to him by believing. Let nothing
discourage you in this pursuit, and expectation. The Lord Jesus hath given
himself for you, even unto Death, that you may be his in the sweetest, and
most intimate union. He giveth himself to you in his life of Glory, that he
may be yours by an immediate, and entire union. He giveth his Spirit to
you, to be the Maker, and the band of this union, to work faith in you, and
make you Believers. He is now with you, now in you in the fulness of his
merits, righteousness, glory, love, and Spirit. Now this moment open the
Eyes of your minds, and behold him in the midst of you, open your hearts,
and take him in, cast your selves into his open arms, and heart, cleave to him
by believing. So even this moment shall your Souls, and Bodies both, which
are naturally the Members of this Harlot, the Flesh, and the World; which
are naturally Dens of Thieves, and Devils, become the Members of the Lord
Jesus, and the Temples of the Holy Ghost. The Lord Jesus shall be in your
Body itself, as in a Member of himself, a Fountain of living waters even in
Death, and in the Grave, making it there a Paradise, a Garden for God, and
for all blessed Spirits. The Holy Ghost shall be, not only in your Souls, but
in your Bodies also as in his Holy. Temple, even in the darkness of Death it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
filling it with his Glory, and moving over it with his Doves Wings, the
Wings of Eternal Love.</p>
               <p>3. Make it your chief work, and end to grow in the knowledge of the
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:49838:242"/>
Lord Jesus. What care, and pains do we take to grow in riches? yet riches
profit not in the day of Wrath. To know him is eternal life. With what
diligence do we pursue the wisdom of this world? Yet saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> as dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Fool, so dyeth the wise Man. If thou gain, and grow in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Lord Jesus, this is a wisdom, which will make thy Soul, and
Body both shine with a Light of Glory, and Immortality, even in Death it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<hi>Solomon</hi> saith, that when understanding enters into our Souls, wisdom
will be sweeter, than hony to our tast. O what new tast, and rellishes of new,
and unexpressible sweetnesses doth the Soul still meet with, which is still grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus? What a sweet tast, and rellish of
Death beyond all the delights of Life doth the knowledge of Jesus Christ
give unto us, representing it as a Feast of pleasant things to our Bodies also,
as well as to our Souls? When thou understandest the fellowship, and vertue
of Christs Death in thy Death, thou shalt see Death in thy Soul, and in thy
Body, as the Carkass of a dead Lyon torn in pieces by that true <hi>Samson,</hi> the
Lord Jesus, whither the Father himself, and Christ, and the Holy Spirit, with
all the blessed Angels resort, as Bees to their Hive; laying there their Hony,
and their Hony-comb for thee to eat.</p>
               <p>4. O you, that are Christs, love Death, Death is now become but a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of Death. True life with all the joys of life, vails itself beneath that
shadow. If you knew the love of the Father, the Glory of the Lord Jesus,
the joys of the Holy Ghost in Death; if you knew what the Death of a Saint
were, how precious, you would ask it continually of God, that he would hasten it
in the time thereof. You would cry out continually, as <hi>Sisera's</hi> Mother did,
why doth his Chariot stay? Death is not now a shadow of Death, but a living,
delightful, and divine shadow cast from the glorious face of our Lord Jesus,
under which our Souls, and Bodies lie together, as in a sweet, and divine sleep
in his Bosom, in which sleep all the joys, and glories of Heaven, and Eternity
are present with us, as a divine Dream, out of which we wake at the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
finding all to be true, eternally true, and the sweet shadow, and dream
themselves swallowed up into a bright, clear, and full enjoyment. Thus, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Language, doth the very Body of a Saint, when he dies,
sleep in the Lord. Thus is death to the Soul, and Body of a Saint, as the
Curtains of Purple round about <hi>Solomons</hi> Bed, where the Saint lies now in the
embraces of the true <hi>Solomon</hi> himself, the King of Righteousness, and King
of Peace, or round about the Chariot of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which had within it a
Throne of Gold, and was paved with Love. As the Sun by its influence
forms a precious Mine of Gold in the bowels of the Earth, which afterward
being taken out, and separated from its dross, becomes pure and incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and is made a Crown for the Head of a great King: so the Lord Jesus
by his Spirit frames a new, a heavenly Soul, and Body in a Saint, which are
both his precious Members, his Temples of Gold. But while this life lasts, they
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:49838:242"/>
are in this Body of Sin, and Death, as Gold in the Oar. In the moment of
Death the Lord Jesus takes them both out, separates them entirely from the
dross of all earthliness, and carnality, makes them pure, and shining Diadems
in the hand of God.</p>
               <p>2. Propos. The whole Person of a Saint in Soul and Body at the moment
of Death, is gathered up entirely into a Spiritual Principle, and so into a
Spiritual Sense, and so into a Divine Life, and Peace. This followeth of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
upon the former Proposition, which I have already proved by the
Scripture. For, if a Saint in Death be gathered up entirely out of a Carnal
Principle; he is gathered up entirely into a Spiritual Principle. There is now
no middle between these two.</p>
               <p>We read in Scripture of the divided state of a Saint between freedom, and
bondage, liberty, and captivity; the War between the Spirit, and the Flesh,
while he lives on Earth. Accordingly we meet with exhortations to abide in
Christ, to walk in the Spirit, if we live in the Spirit. But, when a Saint dies,
we read of him, and that with a peculiar relation to his Body, that he sleeps
in the Lord, that he sleeps in Christ. O sweet, and full expression! O beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and blessed State! Now is a Saint with his Body, as well as his Soul alone
in Christ, entirely in Christ, for ever in Christ, in Christ risen from the
Dead, a quickning Spirit, in the Glory of the Father, with the fulness of the
God-Head, and all fulness dwelling in him. Now is the Body also of a
Saint at rest in a sweet rest, in a living rest. For such is the rest of sleep.
It is in an immortal, and glorious rest, in a rest of Divine Love, and Joys,
which, though it bears the similitude of Death to Carnal Sense, yet in truth is
above all the degrees, and delights of life here. For such is the sleep in Christ.</p>
               <p>But I will open this Proposition to you more clearly, and fully by that two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
relation, which the Scriptures attribute to the Body of a Believer. 1. Of
a Member of Christ. 2. The Temple of the Holy Ghost. Both these are
affirmed by the Holy Apostle, and the Blessed Spirit, with an assured confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
as truths known to all, and undeniable by any, 1 <hi>Corin. 6. 15. Know
ye not, that your Bodies are the Members of Christ? 19. Know ye not, that your
Bodies are the Temples of the Holy Ghost?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Body of a Saint is the Member of Christ. This relation of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership
implyeth three things. 1. Union. 2. Communion. 3. Proportion, or
Suitableness.</p>
               <p>1. There is an union between the Body of a Believer, and Jesus Christ, an
Union of Membership. But to what Christ is the Body of a Believer united?
To Christ risen from the Dead, to Christ in Glory. So you shall read, <hi>Rom.
7. 4. You are dead by the dead Body of Christ, that you might be Married
to another, to him who is risen from the Dead.</hi> Marriage, and Membership are
two distinct expressions of the same union between Christ and a Saint, which
for its dearness, nearness, entireness, and inseparableness is unexpressible, in as
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:49838:243"/>
much as it comprehends the sweetness, and vertue of all unions among the
Creatures, either Men, or Angels, and transcendeth them all. But you, have
these two unions of Membership, and Marriage between the Body of a Saint
singly and expresly, and the Lord Jesus, joyned together by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who
founds that of Membership, upon that of Marriage, 1 <hi>Corin. 6. 15. Know
ye not, that your Bodies are the Members of Christ</hi> Then he makes good that,
thus, <hi>v. 16. 17. It is said those two shall be one Flesh, But he that is joyned to
the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> The days of Christs life on Earth are called the days of
his Flesh. He hath the name of a Spirit given to him, as he is risen from the
Dead, as he is in the Heavenly Image, and in Glory. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls him in
one place the Lord that Spirit, in another place, the quickning Spirit. St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
saith of him; he was put to death in the Flesh, and quickned
in the Spirit. Thus the Body of a Saint is married to Christ, is a
Member of Christ. By this union it becomes a Spiritual Body, a Spirit, one
Spirit with Christ.</p>
               <p>There is a threefold band of this union of Membership, the same Spirit,
the same Life, the same Image.</p>
               <p>1. The first band of Union in this Membership between the Body of a
Believer, and Jesus Christ, is the same Spirit, St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Corin. 12. 13.
We all by one Spirit are Baptized into one Body.</hi> The Unity of the ever-blessed
Spirit is the sure, and sweet band which tyeth one to another, the glorious
Head, and all the blessed Members in the Body of Christ. But what sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
lies in the universality of that expression; we all are Baptized by one
Spirit into one Body? As the Soul of Man is all in the whole Body, and all
in every part of it; so is that ever-blessed Spirit, which is in the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Body, of which the Holy Angels, Glorified Saints, Christ, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are Fellow-members, one and the same, whole, and entire in every part
of this Body of thine, O Believer, which in its lowest, and most broken State
is a Member of Christ. This union is so much more close, full, and sweet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Members, by how much more Spiritual the Body is; by how much
the more high, and divine the Unity is in this Body; by how much the more
high, and divine the unity of that blessed Spirit is, in which the Father of
Lights, the Heavenly Bride-groom, Glorified Saints, all the Elect Angels dwell
together in one,</p>
               <p>2. The same Life flowing from this one Spirit is the second band of this
Union. We read from St. <hi>Paul, Rom. 8. 11. If the Spirit of him;
which raised Christ from the Dead, dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from
the Dead, shall also quicken your mortal Bodies by his Spirit dwelling in you.</hi>
This expression, shall quicken, signifieth not only an effect at a distance, at
the last day, but a present effect immediately flowing from the indwelling of
the Spirit in us. For the union between the Spirit, and our Bodies, by which
he dwelleth in them also, as well, as in our Souls, is a vital union, an union,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:49838:243"/>
from which Membership springs. This expression then, shall quicken your
mortal Bodies, is like that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the same Epistle; Sin shall not have
dominion over you, if you be not under the Law, but under Grace, <hi>Shall,</hi>
there expresseth an effect immediately, and inseparably flowing from its cause,
a freedom from the dominion of Sin by being under Grace, not under the
Law. The Spirit of Christ findeth our Bodies Natural, and Mortal; but by
its enterance into them, and inhabitation in them, maketh them, immediately
Spiritual, and Immortal by their union with Christ, and by the pouring forth
of his Life, and Immortality into them.</p>
               <p>3. The band of union in this Membership is the same Image. All the
Members of every Body make up one Image, in which each several Member
bears a part. As we have born the Image of the Earthly Man, so shall we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
bear the Image of the Heavenly. So far, O Saint, as thy Body is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Heavenly Body of Christ, it bears the same Heavenly Image.
This is the first thing in Membership, the union.</p>
               <p>2. There is in Membership a Communion. We read the 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 12. 24,
25, 26. God hath tempered the Body together, having given the more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
honour to that part, which lacked, that there should be no Schism in
the Body, but that the Members should have the same care one for another,
and whether one Members suffer, all the Members suffer with it, or one Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
be honoured, all the Members rejoice with it. There is a threefold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in the Body of Christ. A Communion of Cares, a Communion of
Sufferings, a Communion of Joy and Glory.</p>
               <p>1. There is a Communion of Cares. All the Members have the same care
one for another. As it is in the Natural Body, the Head, the Heart, the Eye,
the Hand, all are set on work for every other part, for the little Toes, as for
themselves, to defend, or cherish it upon every occasion: so is it in the Body
of Christ. O Saint! with what quietness, and security mayest thou lye down
to rest, and sleep in the midst of all wants, enemies, and dangers? Thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
itself is a Fellow-Member in the Body of Christ with all the glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and Blessed Spirits, with Christ the head of all, and the Father the Head
of Christ. All these have the same care of thy Body for every part, of it in
every State, as for themselves. For it is themselves, a Member, and part of
themselves. They all are present with it, they encompass it, they minister unto
it all things seasonable for its defence, and comfort.</p>
               <p>2. There is a Communion of sufferings. Whether one Member suffer, all
the Members suffer with it. O Christians! what a sweetning is this to the
bitterest affliction? How doth this take away the solitude, the sadness, the
sting from Poverty, a Prison, a Sickness, the Grave? You are in the heart of
all Angels, and Saints of Christ, and of the Father to suffer, to live, and to
die together with you. All the Heavenly company, that are by one Spirit ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together into that one glorious Body of Christ, lye down with you in
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:49838:244"/>
the Dust, in a Dungeon, on a sick Bed, in the Grave. How is the Spouse of
Christ now in its most solitary, and afflicted State indeed, as two Heavenly
Companies, according to the expression in the <hi>Canticles?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Fellow-members in the Body of Christ have a Communion of
Joy, and Glory. Whether one Member be honoured, all the Members rejoice
with it, A Believer is ever glorious, ever blessed. St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, that when
we suffer for the name of Christ, the Spirit of Glory, and of God resteth
upon us. Every suffering of a Saint, so far as he is a Saint, is for Christ. Why
art thou ever melancholy, why is thy Heart heavy within thee, O Believer?
Open thine Eyes to see them, open thine Heart to take them in. Behold the
Joys, and Glories of all the blessed in Heaven are thine, are present with thee,
and ever rest upon thee. I will conclude this Communion with that most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
expression: God hath tempered the Body together. The word is
hath mingled the Body together. How full an expression is this? How doth
this mixture sweeten all our sufferings, and make all our Joys far more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant?
Thou, O Believer, with all thy shame, and sufferings art tempered, and
mingled together with all the Saints, and Angels above, with Christ,
and the Father, with all their Joys, and Glories. All the same Heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
with all the same Joys, and Glories, are tempered, and mingled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with thee, with thy shames, and sufferings here below. Thus are all one
piece, and that one piece whole, and entire in every one. Thus is the greater,
the greatest comeliness put upon the most indigent. Thus is there no Schism
in the Body. As in many Spirits tempered into one Spirit, many Liquors tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
into one Liquor, many Spices beaten into the smallest Powder, mingled
into one costly Ointment, every portion of this Spirit, this Liquor, this Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath all the Spirits, all the Liquors, all the Ointments of the whole in
it: so is the Body of Christ in general, and every Member in particular.</p>
               <p>3. The proportion, or suitableness. There is no Schism in the Body of
Christ. If this be pure, precious, living, immortal, heavenly, and glorious,
then is thy Body also, O Believer, so far as it is a Member of this Body, pure,
precious, living, immortal, heavenly, &amp; glorious. How living, how immortal, how
beautiful, how glorious, how divine a thing is that Body of a Saint, which is a
Member of Christ in Glory? What Life, what Joys are those of this Body,
which is in so dear, so inseparable, so intimate an Union, and Communion of the
same Life, Joys, Beauties, and Spirit with all the glorious Angels, blessed Spirits,
Christ himself, the Head of all, &amp; the Father in Christ? This is the State of the
Body of a Saint, as it is a Member of Christ. But while a Saint lives in this
world, his Body is partly the Member of this Heavenly Husband, the Lord
Jesus, and partly the Member of a Harlot, this World, and the Flesh; in as
much as a Saint here below hath his life, and conversation divided between
the pure Spirit of Christ, and the Whorish Spirit of this world. O sweet, O
beautiful, O precious, and blessed Death! By Death is the joyful, and glorious
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:49838:244"/>
separation made in the Body of a Saint, between the precious, and the vile,
between the heavenly Bridegroom, the Lord Jesus, and the Hellish Adulterer, this
World. Now it ceaseth for ever to be in any degree any more the Member of
the Harlot, to be in a Carnal, or worldly Spirit. Now it's for ever singly, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
gathered up into the Spirit, Body, and Bosom of Jesus Christ. O! how
pure, how shining, in what Angelical, in what Spiritual, in what Divine a
form, and fulness of unexpressible rest, beauty, and delight is the Body of a
Saint in the very moment of Death, when, like fine Gold purged from its
dross, or a Heavenly Sun, that hath cast up its cloud, it now comes forth out
of the Whorish Spirit of the Flesh, and this World, a single, and pure Member in
the pure, and divine Body of our Lord Jesus? These are the three things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in this Membership of the Body of a Believer in Christ; Union, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and proportion.</p>
               <p>From this I shall raise a threefold short exhortation.</p>
               <p>1. Set a value upon the new Birth, upon the Regeneration. Content not
your selves with being once born. By your first Birth you have Souls, and
Bodies Members of this world. By the Spirit of this world they are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
into the Body, and Society of Darkness, Corruption, Death, Wrath, the
whole Company of wicked Spirits, and Devils. Give your selves no rest till
you are born again. By the new Birth, which is from above, you have new
Souls, and new Bodies, which are Members one of another, Fellow-members
of Christ. Your Souls, and your Bodies both are by that one, Eternal Spirit
Baptized into one Spiritual, Immortal, and glorious Body with the Spirits of
all just men made evangelically perfect by the Blood, and Spirit of Christ;
with all the Holy Angels, with Christ, and the Father. Press into the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of this mystery. Here you shall see it indeed to be true, that Grace
is Glory begun in your Souls, and Bodies both; that when you believe, a
Spirit of Glory rests upon your whole Person by your Union with Christ.</p>
               <p>2. Possess this Vessel of your Bodies in holiness. For so you shall possess it
in honour. Possess it, converse with it in a Spiritual Principle. So you shall
enjoy it, and your selves in it, as a Member of Christ. You shall see, feel, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
within your selves in this Body, the Spirit, the Life, the Immortality, the
Joy, the Glory of the whole Body of Christ, the society of all things Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
Blessed and Eternal, to wake, and to sleep, to walk, and lie down, to
live, and to dye with you. This is the true Church-fellowship, a Fellowship
in our Souls, and in our Bodies by a Spiritual Principle, and Life with the
Church, and Assembly of the first-born, with all things in their first born
State, in one Spiritual, and Heavenly Body in Christ.</p>
               <p>3. How amiable, and lovely doth this make death to the Saints? This is
the chief end I aim at in my discourse, and the point to which I bring it. With
what a beautiful, and smiling Face doth Death now look forth even in the
Body of a Saint, in which he hath been wont generally to appear so grim to
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:49838:245"/>
the holiest Persons? Thy Body, O Believer, so far as thou standest in a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Principle, is a Fellow-member with thy Soul in the Body of Christ: It is
a Jewel, the work of a faithful, and curious workman the most holy Spirit;
as <hi>Solomon</hi> in the <hi>Canticles</hi> speaketh of the Spouse of Christ. But here the
mixture of the fleshly, and carnal Principle is as Dust, and Dirt, which cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
and fullyeth this costly Jewel. With what a sweet, pure lustre of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
and of Heavenly Glory doth it sparkle, and shine forth, ravishing
thine own, and all spiritual Eyes, and Hearts in the moment of Death, when
the blessed hand of Death clean wipes off the dust, and stain of the carnal
Principle, and brings it forth entirely into its Spiritual Principle, that now it
stands singly, as a Spiritual Member in the Spiritual Body of Christ?</p>
               <p>The Lord Jesus saith; if thine Eye be single, thine whole Body shall be
light, as when a Candle enlightens a Room. In this life O Saints, we have a
double Eye, and have a double sight. The mixture of the Spiritual, and
Carnal Principle is the double, and divided Eye. O welcome Death, receive it
with open embraces. Now is your Eye single. Now is the carnal Principle
cast out for ever. Now you look forth with the open, and single Eye of the single
Principle of the Eternal Spirit. Now is your whole Body, nay, now is the whole
body of things filled to you with a Heavenly light of Immortality, &amp; Glory. This
single Eye pours forth from the Unity of the Spirit, as from the Fountain of
blessed Light thorow your whole Souls, and Bodies, thorow all things round
about them a Light of Glory, as when a Candle enlightneth a Room.</p>
               <p>A way of cleansing Pearls, when they have any spot, or cloud upon them
is to thrust them down the throat of a Pigeon into its Crop, where the heat
of the Pigeon takes off the stain, and makes them perfectly white. This is the
mystery of a Saints Death. The Heavenly Dove, the Holy Spirit in the same
moment takes a Saint entirely in Soul, and Body out of this Life, out of the
Carnal Principle into himself, into his Bosom of Love, by the Divine heat of
that Love takes off every spot, or cloud of the flesh by consuming it both in
the Soul, and in the Body, and makes them both purely white, and shining.
Pearls in the Heavenly Body of that one great, and only Pearl the Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>2. The second relation, into which the Body of a Believer is taken at the
new birth, is that of a Temple to the Holy Ghost. There are 4 things proper to
a Temple. 1. The Figure. 2. The Glory. 3. The Communion. 4. The
Defence.</p>
               <p>1. Every thing in the Tabernacle, and so in the Temple to the least
things, and lowest actions were divine Types of Spiritual Truths, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Excellencies in the Person of the Lord Jesus. So it is said, that all
things were made, and ordered according to the pattern in the Mount, which
pattern in the Mount was Christ in Glory. O Saints! This Tabernacle, and
Temple were Types first of Christ, then of you, whose Souls, and Bodies
both are the true, and living Temples of God. The Body of a Saint is a
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:49838:245"/>
more excellent Temple, in as much as <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was a shadow only
of this. It is a Living, Divine, and Immortal Temple. It is therefore in the
whole a far more excellent, more rich, more glorious, and delightful Image of
the God-Head in its entire form. It is in every part, and point of it a most
lively, a most beautiful, a most pleasant figure of some particular Mystery,
and Glory in the God Head.</p>
               <p>All the parts of your Bodies themselves, the lowest, and least, even to a hair
of your Heads, every thing that befals you in every part of your Body in the
meanest, and slightest circumstance, is formed exactly by the Divine Wisdom,
and Power, according to the Divine Will, to answer the Pattern in the Mount,
to be the holy figure of an eternal Glory in Christ. We read <hi>Psal. 29. 9. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing in his Temple speaks Glory.</hi> Every thing in thy Body, O Believer,
so far as thou art a Believer, speaks Glory. For this is his Temple. O live
alwaies in the Spirit, that thou maist alwaies be in thy Body, as in the Temple,
that there thou maist see, understand, and enjoy the Glory in every thing!</p>
               <p>2. The Temple of God is filled with the Glory of God. There is a
Prophesy in <hi>Malachy,</hi> concerning the times of the Gospel, that he shall come
into his Temple. You, O Saints are the Temple, which is here Prophefied of.
Jesus Christ, as God in the Glory of the Father, in the Third Person, the
Holy Ghost, comes into you, into your Bodies also, and fills them with his
Glory. The same word in Hebrew signifieth a Temple, and a Pallace. The
name of a Temple in Greek, signifieth an Habitation, or dwelling place. It is
a note of a learned Divine, that the Temple had Tables, and a Throne, and a
State in it, which was the Golden Mercy Seat called in the Gospel, the Throne
of Grace, to signifie that the Temple of God was his Pallace, as he is the
great King. The Eternal Spirit is present in the Body of a Believer, as in his
Pallace. He keeps his Court there. There is his Throne, with all the blessed
Angels, and all the Heavenly Company, waiting round about it.</p>
               <p>It is called his resting-place. Arise, saith <hi>David</hi> to God, thou, and the
Ark of thy strength into thy resting-place. God shineth forth in his Temple,
filleth it with his Glory within, resting upon it, and overshadowing it with
his Glory without. In the 50 <hi>Psal.</hi> at the beginning the Psalmist speaking of
the Temple saith; God shineth from <hi>Sion,</hi> the perfection of Beauty. What
a perfection of Beauty then, what a Divine Pallace, how full of Glory
within, how encompassed with a clear, &amp; shining Glory round about is that
Body of a Saint, which is the living, eternal Temple of the Holy Ghost? In
what Majesty doth this Eternal Spirit appear here upon its Throne of Love?
In the midst of what Divine Pleasures, and Delights doth it rest for ever
here. What a Court does it keep here with all its Train of Angels, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Attendants, waiting round about its Throne, as in another Heaven? O Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
honor your Bodies. For these, so far as you stand in a Spiritual Principle,
are as another Heaven, the Heaven of Heavens, the Pallace of the great King,
which he fills with his Glory, where he heeps his Court, &amp; sits upon his Throne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="462" facs="tcp:49838:246"/>
3. The Saints have communion with God in his Temple. In the Temple
was the Golden Mercy-Seat. There, saith God, will I commune with thee.
This was overspread with Cherubims of Glory, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them. These
Cherubims covered this Golden Mercy-Seat with their Wings, and so made
the State, or Glory about the Throne. This is therefore called the secret of
the most high, and the shadow of the Almighty, where a Saint is said to dwell,
and to lodge. Hear, O ye Saints, what glorious things are spoken of your
Bodies; be Spiritual, and behold in these Temples the Golden Mercy-Seat,
which is the glorified Person of Christ, and the Cherubims of Glory covering
it with their Wings, and God here upon this Golden Mercy-Seat, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Bosom of Christ from between the Wings of the Cherubims, ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to commune with you, yea taking you up upon this Golden Mercy-Seat,
within the Wings of the Cherubims, to commune freely with him at all
seasons in this secret of eternal safety, rest, love, joy, and glory.</p>
               <p>This Temple is the Body of a Saint while he liveth below; but now it
is in too great a degree covered with a cloud of Flesh, filled with the smoak of
the Spirit of this world, that a Saint too rarely enters into this Temple of
the holy Ghost in his own Body, and more rarely seeth with any degree of
clearness the Glory, or heareth the voice of the blessed Spirit there. What
joy is it to think, in what a purely sacred, and Divine Temple, in what a clear,
and shining Pallace of the eternal King, in what open, and unstained, unvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
visions of Divine Glory, in what a secret, in what a presence of glorious
Angels, and Eternal Spirits, in the midst of what sweet overshadowings, dear
encompassings, naked outshinings of the Eternal Spirit, in what most blessed,
most ravishing Communion of Eternal Light, Life, and Love with this Spirit,
in what sight, and embraces, with what kisses of incomprehensible Beauties, in
the sound of what words, what salutations, what wooings, what expressions of
the highest Loves, and Joys from the Eternal Spirit a Saint finds himself even
in his own proper Body in the very moment of his Death, when departing out
of this Life at once he departs for ever out of the Fleshly Image, and the Spirit of
this World?</p>
               <p>4. The Divine Presence, and Glory was the defence of the Temple, <hi>Esa.</hi>
4. 5. There is a Prophesy concerning the times of the Gospel expressed by
figures taken from the state of things under the Law: And the Lord will
create upon every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>welling place of Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and upon her Assemblies a
Cloud, and smoak by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night. For
upon all the Glory shall be a defence, or a covering. When the first Temple
was to be destroyed, the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> saw the Glory removing off from it;
afterwards, when the second Temple was near its end, a voice was heard in it
saying; Let us be gone from hence, which was understood to be the voice of
God, and of his holy Angels with all those invisible companies, and Minist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which made up the Glory of the Divine Presence, as Nobles, Officers,
and Guards make up the Court of a King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:49838:246"/>
O Saints! why do you fear for your Bodies hidden Conspiracies, or open
force, diseases, the fury of the Elements, the malice of Men, or Devils? These
Bodies of yours are the Temples of the Holy Ghost. Here are the Holy As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of all the Heavenly Company in the unity of the Spirit, whose
Temples your Bodies are. Of these it is Prophesied, to these it is promised,
that God will create upon them a cloud, and a smoak by day, the shining of a
flaming fire by night. Upon these the Glory is a defence, or a covering. God
himself with all his holy Ones, his Angels, his Watchmen, his ministring
Spirits is this Cloud, this Glory, which is the defence, and covering upon your
whole Persons your Bodies, as well as your Souls: both have together with
Christ a hidden Life, a secure Life, in this secret of God within this covering
of this Divine Cloud, Flame, and Glory. From off these Temples of your
Bodies this Glory never removes. From within these Temples of your Bodies
this heavenly Company never departs; for as much as the union in the Spirit of
Grace under the Gospel is Eternal.</p>
               <p>Thus the Bodies also of Believers in this Life are the Temples of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost. All things in them here are divine Figures of a divine Glory. They
are filled and covered with the Glory itself. They are the seats of the freest
Communion with this Glory, being the Temples of the God of Gods, and
so the Pallaces of the King of Kings. All this is true of them here, as they
stand in a Spiritual Principle, and in union with Christ by the new birth.</p>
               <p>But this Life is a mixt State. We stand partly in a Spiritual, partly in a
Fleshly Principle. These Temples of our Bodies are covered with a corrupt
Flesh, that we can hardly discern their Spiritual Beauties. They are too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in too great a part filled with a smoak of Hell, the smoak of the
Spirit of this world, that a Believer can rarely enter into this Temple of his
Body to behold, and converse with the Glory there.</p>
               <p>This is the precious, the blessed work of Death in a Believer. It breaketh
the union, it maketh a separation not between Christ, and a Believer, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Soul, and Body of a Believer, as they are joyned together in
Christ by the band, and unity of the Eternal Spirit, and make one Spiritual
Man, or Person in Christ; but between the precious, and the vile, between the
Carnal and Spiritual Principle of a Saint both in Soul and Body.</p>
               <p>Now in the moment of Death the Soul, and Body of a Saint come forth
immediately, clear, and shining Temples of the Spirit; the smoak, and clouds
of the Fleshly Principles, and of this worldly Image being for ever driven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from within them, and from without.</p>
               <p>Thus you understand St. <hi>Pauls</hi> sweet, and blessed sense of Death, when he
speaketh of the Body, and saith, 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 5. 1. 2. That, <hi>we shall not be found
naked, but be cloathed upon from above with a building of God Eternal in the
Heavens, which shall swallow up mortality in life.</hi> Our Spiritual Body, which
we have in this life by our new Birth, as we stand in our Spiritual Principle is
this Divine Building sprung from a Divine Root, of a Divine Nature, or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:49838:247"/>
of a Divine Form, and Workmanship. This is ever in Heaven, being
inseparably united to Christ, and being ever in the Spirit. This is Eternal,
when we die, this casts off the Cloud of corrupt, and cursed Flesh. This
springs forth out of its Spiritual Principle, as out of Heaven, and the Bosom
of God. This rests upon us, takes us in, cloaths us entirely, universally with
itself. Thus we are never found naked not for any one the least moment. All
that life, all those objects, entertainments, and joys, which we possessed before
in the Cloud, in the Captivity of a mortal Image, yea the very Image of
mortality itself, besides innumerable new and unconceivable Glories, are
all the very same things present with us in this Heavenly Building; this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Body; but after a new, and more excellent manner. We have our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
things a hundred-fold more pleasant. We have our unpleasant things
with an unmixed, pure, and perfect pleasantness, as they stand within in the
Divine Mystery, and Love. Thus desirable, and delightful is death to a Saint,
which now indeed is no more Death, but the flood, the Fountain of pure
Light, Eternal Life, the Divine Love breaking forth in his Soul, and Body,
and swallowing up every thing of Mortality into itself.</p>
               <p>Give me leave here to take occasion to shir you up to the love, and pursuit
of Spirituality in Religion, by a short exhortation.</p>
               <p>1. Understand your loss. How many precious, and glorious truths of the
Gospel? What Heavenly, and Divine growths in Grace? How many sweet,
unexpressible consolations, and joys in life, and in death are we unacquainted
with, are we uncapable of for want of the Spirit, and Spirituality? I have
many things to speak unto you, saith our Lord Jesus to his Disciples before
his Death; but ye cannot bear them now. Why? Hitherto they knew Christ
after the Flesh only. The Spirit was not come, which was to lead them into
all truths, and to be their eminent comforter. I could not speak unto you, as
to Spiritual, but as to Carnal, saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthtans,</hi> who yet were
pussed up with a conceit of their knowledge.</p>
               <p>2. Consider the danger from the want of Spirituality. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith in
one place, that what the Law speaketh, it speaketh to those that are under the
Law. The Law in Scripture is called the Letter, which is the Figure, and
Image only: The Gospel the Spirit, which is the Life, and Truth. This then
is the dreadful curse, which the Law pronounceth upon those, who live, and
worship God in the oldness of the Letter; not in the newness of the Spirit:
that their Eyes, their Ears, their Hearts shall be closed, made fat, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that seeing they shall not see, hearing they shall not understand, that
they shall be taught line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little, and
there a little, that they may fall backward, and perish, and never rise more;
because, when Christ was presented to them in the Spirit of Life, and Glory
to be their rest, and refreshing for ever, they would not obey the heavenly
Call. O dreadful danger! O deadly curse! Hear this O Professors; O Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:49838:247"/>
who are Carnal, and not Spiritual! Tremble and fear to be eternally
imprisoned in the dark Image, and killing Letter, being for ever excluded
from the marvellous light of God, from the Eternal Life, and from the most
glorious truth itself of all Heavenly, and Divine Things, to wander perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in a barren Wilderness of Graves, and of fiery Serpents, never to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the rest of God, nor the refreshing of the Eternal Spirit. O Silly Men,
and silly Women, that are ever learning, ever hearing Sermons, ever praying,
ever reading the Scriptures, ever sounding forth the name of Christ, and God;
yet at the end of one, ten, or twenty years, still laden with the same diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Lusts, and Passions, still moving forward, and backward upon the same
Carnal, and literal sense of things, never coming to the knowledge of the
Truth, as the Truth is in Jesus, as the Spirit is Truth!</p>
               <p>3. See the advantages of Spirituality, as they are laid together, 2 <hi>Corin.</hi>
3. At the latter end.</p>
               <p>1. Liberty, <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty;</hi> a pure free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from the servitude of hellish Lusts, and passions; a pleasant freedom from
fears, cares, consinements; from the Law, Death, and Wrath; a Divine Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from the vale of the Flesh, the Law, the Letter of things, from every
Earthly, Created, Darkning, Dividing Principle, Life, and Image; the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a free access into the purity, power, rest, joys, glories, immortality, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteness
of the Spirit, and of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>2. A clear discovery, evidence, and seal of the new Birth in you. <hi>We
with open Face behold the Glory of the Lord.</hi> The open face there (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
clearly by the context of the words) is the Spiritual, and Heavenly
Man within us unvailed, appearing evidently with the Seal of his own Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Beauties, and Glories upon it, in the openness, and freedom of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,
and Divine Light. Where are doubts, where are fears now concerning
our condition? they are fled away, and vanish, as the shadows of the night
before the Sun rising, and shining forth with open face.</p>
               <p>3. A clear vision of the Lord Jesus in Glory within thy self. <hi>We all with
open face, as in a glass, beholding the Glory of the Lord,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> It is
in Greek beholding, as in a Looking-glass, where the Face, that is seen, is the
Face of him who fees, reflected upon itself. O blessed State of a Spiritual
Saint! The Spiritual Man in him is a Divine, and living Looking-glass, in
which, while he beholds the face of the Lord Jesus in Glory, he sees his own
Face, and the glorious form of his own Heavenly Person reflected upon itself.
The Person which sees, the Heavenly Person which is seen, and the Glass, are
all one Spirit. All these dwell together, see, possess, and enjoy one another in
the same Life, and Image.</p>
               <p>4. Spirituality brings a lively, and lovely growth in all Grace. We are
changed, saith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> into the likeness of the same Image from Glory to
Glory. These words import three excellencies in the growth of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:49838:248"/>
Person. 1. It is continual, which is implied in that expression <hi>from Glory
to Glory.</hi> One degree of growth immediately follows another. The Kingdom
of Heaven, which is the State of Spirituality, and in the Holy Ghost, is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Corn, which grows by day, and by night, in Winter, and in Summer.
It is growing every moment, till it be ripe for the Harvest. 2. Spirituality
groweth by great increases. Here the name of Glory is put upon the growths
of Grace in a Spiritual State from Glory to Glory. In another place St. <hi>Paul</hi>
expresseth it by <hi>the increases of God,</hi> that is, swift, great, glorious, divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases,
as by the immediate springings of the Godhead, and bearing the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God in Glory. 3. Spirituality makes the Glorified Person of Christ the
Pattern, the Measure, the Mark, and End of its growth. So saith St. <hi>Paul,
Beholding the Glory of the Lord, we are changed into the likeness of the same
Image.</hi> A Spiritual Person hath the Lord Jesus cloathed with a Spiritual Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ever in his eye; is continually taking him into his Heart, continually bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him forth into his whole Person and Life, with an increasing clearness and
fulness. As the Object is to the Faculty, and to the Soul; so is Jesus Christ to
a Spiritual Person, his Pattern, his Object, his Food, his Feast, which spreads
itself quite thorow his Person and Life, which all throughout turns into Life,
Strength, Beauty, Cheerfulness, and Joy to him.</p>
               <p>5. A spiritual person in a sweet and sealing manner sees the Spirit himself
presenting the Lord Jesus to him within himself in a spiritual Glory; feels the
Spirit himself springing up immediately within him in all sights of Christ, in
all his changes, and growths into Christ. He sees, and feels this Spirit to be Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ himself. He sees and feels this Spirit, and this Jesus to be in himself,
and one Spirit with himself. So the verse forementioned runs; <hi>We all with
open face, beholding, as in a Looking-glass, the Glory of the Lord, are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the likeness of the same Image, from Glory to Glory, as by the Spirit of the
Lord;</hi> or, according to the Greek, <hi>by the Lord that Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the sweet and blessed Advantages of a Spiritual State. I will add
some few and short Directions to this State.</p>
               <p>1. Look to the New Birth in You. See that you be born again, that you
be born from above, that you be born of the Spirit; that this which is born
in you, be Spirit, Jesus Christ saith, <hi>That which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi>
This only is the New Birth. Newness is only in the Eternal Spring, the Spirit.</p>
               <p>2. Take care of your Union with Christ, that it be a Spiritual Union; that
you be united to Christ, as he is risen from the Dead, and in Glory, as he is a
Spirit, the King and Bridegroom of Spirits; that you be united to Christ in
the Spiritual Man; that your Union be a Spiritual Marriage; that you be
one Spirit in the Unity of the Eternal Spirit, which is Love.</p>
               <p>3. Pray for the Spirit, for a Spiritual Understanding, for the Knowledge of
things in the Spirit, as they are Spirit and Life, and so alone Truth. Suck in
the Spirit by day, and by night, from the lips of Christ, from the kisses of
his mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:49838:248"/>
4. Die to every thing of the Flesh, that you may live in the Spirit. Bear
about in your Bodies the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the Life also of the
Lord Jesus, according to the Spirit, may be manifested in your mortal Bodies.
At the young Phoenix is said to spring new and fresh out of the Ashes of the
Old One; so doth the Spirit in the newness of an Heavenly and Immortal
Glory spring out of the Grace of Christ.</p>
               <p>5. Live purely, live in Love. These two, Purity and Love, are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
fruits of the Spirit, by which the Spirit himself is drawn down, and held in
our Hearts, being fed, and delighted with them. Every kind and degree of
impurity and enmity quencheth the Spirit and maketh him to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into Heaven again. The Scripture saith, <hi>The Flesh lusteth against the Spirit,</hi>
to bring forth its own Beauties, Delights and Fruits all over the Spirit of Man
in the place of the Eternal Spirit. The Scripture saith also, That <hi>the Flesh
envyeth against the Spirit:</hi> The Flesh hath an envy, and an envious malice to
see the Spirit with its Eternal Glories, Joys and Fruits to flourish in the Soul.</p>
               <p>6. Lastly; Take heed of thinking that you know enough. <hi>He that thinks
he knows any thing, knows nothing as he ought to know it,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul.</hi> He
that thinks he knows any thing, knows things only after the Letter, which is
a knowledge of shadows only, and a shadow of knowledge. This is that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which pusseth up, which swels a man with a windy conceit of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
But that knowledge which is from the Spirit, as its Fountain, and in
the Spirit, as its air, and element, and of the Spirit, as its only object, this
makes a man at the highest degree of his knowledge on Earth to be sensible,
that all his knowledge is, but as the light of the night, a light shining in a
dark place, not the day-star, and the Sun itself risen upon him. This man
thinks himself at best, as a door-keeper only, or (as the Hebrew word signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
one standing at the threshold of the House of God, who looketh in at a
distance, and hath only a weak glimmering prospect of the Glories there,
but is not yet entered into the Light of those Glories to behold them, as they
are, to know them, as he ought to know them, and is to know them. He
therefore, as a new born Babe from the Womb of the Spirit, keeps his Eye
ever fixed with wonder, and pleasure upon the light of the Spirit, and ever
thirsts to drink in more, and more the sweet milk of this Light.</p>
               <p>The Subject of our discourse hath been the passage of a Saint by Death,
not only in his Soul, but in his Body also, into a State of purity, pleasure,
perfection, and immortality. One of the objections against this was taken
from common sense, to which Death presents the Bodies of the holiest Persons
liveless, ghastly, dissolving to dust. We have answered this objection by a
distinction between a twofold sense, Carnal, and Spiritual. But this objection
was enforced from the Body of Christ, which was a rueful, and bloody specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
in Death, which lay three days in the silence, darkness, and restraint of the
Grave. It is necessary therefore to say something, particularly to the State of
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:49838:249"/>
Christs Body in Death, by the application of this distinction to that also.</p>
               <p>I shall ground this discourse upon that Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 50. They are
the words of Christ: I have a Baptism to be Baptized with, and how am I
streightned till it be over. This Baptism is generally, and as I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
rightly, interpreted to be the sufferings of Christ at his Death. The
Baptism of Christ, and the accomplishment of that Baptism were both at the
time of his Death. The sense of this Baptism before it came, was an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
streightning, or affliction, and oppression to the Soul of Christ. He
cries out, how am I streightned?</p>
               <p>The words thus opened, afford this observation: The Lord Jesus had his
greatest trouble, and his greatest Triumph at the time of his Death. Then
was this bloody Baptism; and then was the blessed accomplishment of this
Baptism. I shall open this in seven Propositions, whereof 5 set forth the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
the other two the Triumph of Christ at his Death.</p>
               <p>1. Propos. It was the most glorious, and eternal Person of God himself
in two Natures, Divine, and Humane, which was our Jesus.</p>
               <p>2. Propos. God in his own Person, as the Divine Nature lived in our Nature
here on Earth, stood at once in a twofold Principle, one Natural, and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary;
the other Supernatural, and Eternal.</p>
               <p>3. Propos. As this Eternal Person our Jesus with his God-Head in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, stood in a Natural, and Temporary Principle, he stood under
the curse, receiving, and feeling all the stings, and bitterness of the curse to
the utmost extremity.</p>
               <p>4. Propos. This our Jesus, as he at the same time with his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in his Humanity, stood in a Supernatural, and Eternal Principle, he in
his Humanity comprehended his Humanity itself, in its natural Principle, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the natural Principle itself, the Curse, all the stings, and bitterness
of the Curse, in a light of Divine Glory, in a life of Divine Love, as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
varieties of pure Love, Joy, and Glory with Immortality.</p>
               <p>5. Propos. The Curse with the stings, and sense of it upon the Natural,
and Temporary Principle, as also the conflict between the Natural, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary,
the Supernatural, and Eternal Principle in the Lord Jesus through
his whole Person, as it lived in a Humane Soul, and Body, were highest at his
Death.</p>
               <p>These are the five Propositions, which set forth the trouble of Christ at
his Death. In the other two followeth his Triumph.</p>
               <p>6. Propos. This Eternal Person our Jesus with his God-Head in his whole
Humanity both Soul, and Body, in the moment of Death by dying, went
entirely forth from the Natural, or Temporary Principle, and so from under
the Curse.</p>
               <p>7. Propos. This same Jesus in his whole Person with his whole Soul, and
Body, in the moment of Death by dying went forth entirely into the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:49838:249"/>
and singleness of his Supernatural, the Eternal Principle, and so into a
State of pure Eternity, unmixt Joy, and Glory.</p>
               <p>I shall briefly open these Propositions in their order.</p>
               <p>1. Propos. It was the most glorious, and eternal Person of God himself in
two Natures, Divine, and Humane, which was our Jesus, <hi>John 1. 14. The
Word was made Flesh.</hi> The second Person in the Trinity, from which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two Persons, the Father and the Spirit are inseparable; the eternal, and
essential Son of God, which hath the fulness of the God-Head in himself, in
its most express Image, and greatest Glory, he in his own Person, in this Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Person, and Sonship, was made Flesh. This Eternal Person, this Essential
Son of God was that Flesh. This Flesh was that Person, that Son, which had
the Father, and the Spirit inseparably with himself, and was essentially one
with them.</p>
               <p>O Christians, study this union of the two Natures Divine, and Humane in
one only Divine, Unchangeable, and Eternal Person, which is the most glorious,
and Ever-blessed God. This is the deep and rich ground of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
out of which, as the true ground of the Heavenly Paradise, the God-Head
itself makes to spring all the precious mysteries of the Gospel, all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Truths, Graces, and Joys in their most Spiritual Beauty, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Life. Understand this: Pray for the understanding of this, for a sight,
sense, and feeling of it within your own Spirits, that it is God, God himself
in his own only Divine, unchangeable, undivided Person, in your own Form,
in your own Nature, in your own Persons, and Spirits, which is your Jesus,
your Saviour, Redeemer, Husband, and King, your Ransom, Atonement,
and Righteousness, your Beauty, your Life, your Joy, your Root, Branch,
Flower, and Fruit. This union between the Divine, and Humane Nature in
one Person in our Lord Jesus, is the Original, and Reason of the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you, and this Jesus, which is God in Person, to which Person, thorow
this union, you also are immediately, eternally united in one Spirit, in one
mystical Person, which is Christ, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, as there is one Body,
and many Members, so is Christ.</p>
               <p>A Spiritual knowledge of this union of two Natures in one Person, and
that God himself is this Person, will sweeten all sufferings of life to you, and
perfume the Grave. Open the Eyes of your Spirits, and behold with joy,
and wonder the going of your God, and King in the Sanctuary of this
Earthly Body. It was the ever-glorious, and immutable Person of God in the
most high, and holy Trinity, which made itself Flesh in the Womb of the
Virgin, which was that Flesh, which in that Flesh eat, drank, slept, talked,
and walked upon the Face of this Earth, which passed under all the clouds,
thorow all the storms of life here, which hung upon the Cross, dyed, and lay
down in the Grave. O with what a Divine, and delightful Glory hath this
Divine presence, and Person silled, and cloathed this Flesh, this Earth, all the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:49838:250"/>
natural actions, and passions of this Flesh, on this Earth, Clouds, Storms, the
Cross, Death, and the Grave to the Spiritual Eyes of Believers? What living
Plants of Paradise; how beautiful, how laden with most pleasant, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Fruits are all these springing up out of this Root, this Divine, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Person? What Jewels are they of incomprehensible virtue; sweetness,
and lustre hanging upon this Person?</p>
               <p>See your selves O all ye Saints, even the lowest, and the least, conformed
to this Image. It is the immortal Seed, and Son of God in you, it is your
Jesus, the most glorious Person of God himself in this Seed in you, which is
made partaker of Flesh, and Blood, which walks on Earth, and acts all the
parts of the natural Life here, which passeth thorow all the Clouds, and Storms
of life, which suffers, dies, and lies in the Grave. The Spoase saith of Christ, he is a
bundle of Myrrh; he shall lye all night between my Breasts. Thus the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature of Christ saith to the Divine Nature. Thus the Earthly Nature
saith to the Heavenly Nature, to the Divine Seed, to the Lord Jesus, to the
Divine Nature in the Lord Jesus: thou art my bundle of Myrrh, thou liest
all the night of this life, and death between my naked Breasts. What cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
can I see in the Grave itself? What Divine Sweetness breaths forth it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in all States? What Divine Treasures of Life, and Immortality fill, and
overflow all; while we thus lye most intimately united, entirely wrapt up in
each other, in the most sweet, and glorious Unity of one Divine, and Eternal
Spirit, one Mystical, Divine, and Eternal Person?</p>
               <p>2. Propos. God in his own Person, as the Divine Nature lived in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
here on Earth, stood at once in a twofold Principle; the one Natural,
and Temporary; the other Spiritual, and Eternal.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jesus was truly, and really a man in every point like unto us, sin
only excepted, as the Scripture speaketh in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Thus
he did bear in himself the Earthly, and Natural Image, he stood in an earthly,
and natural Principle. He came forth from the Father into the World. So
was he made a Servant, and made under the Law.</p>
               <p>But the Lord Jesus was in Person the Eternal Son of God. In this Person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
did the Humane Nature of Christ, with its Natural Principle, and Fleshly
Form in this world subsist. The second Person in the Trinity was the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and Invisible Root, which, through the Divine Nature sent forth, sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
lived, and appeared in the spotless Flesh of the Lord Jesus. Thus the
Manhood of Christ in its Earthly State stood in a natural Principle, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to its proper essence, and created Form; but in a Supernatural, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Principle according to its Personal subsistence in the Eternal Word.</p>
               <p>How patient should we be of Life; nay with what delight, and wonder
should we pass the time of our Pilgrimage hero, if with a Spiritual Eye we
beheld the Lord Jesus in Flesh, and saw our life in flesh a conformity to his?
What a Divine Spectacle, what a mystery of Divinity, how full of Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:49838:250"/>
Beauty, and Glory doth the Life of Christ in Flesh appear, when it is
rightly seen? The Natural Spirit of this world with its natural Image in its
full compass stood in the midst of the Lights, Immortalities, Glories of that
Divine Person which is the Brightness of Glory, the Sea of all Sweetnesses, and
Loves, Eternity itself, God himself. This was the Eternal Principle, which brought
it forth from itself, which bears it up in its own Bosom, which acts it, fills it,
comprehends it, as itself, one Person with itself, itself Personally in a Divine,
and Mysterious Figure, in the midst of all its Divine, and Substantial Glories.</p>
               <p>3. Propos. As this Eternal Person our Jesus with his God-Head in the
Humane Nature, stood in a Natural, and Temporary Principle, he stood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Curse, receiving, and feeling all the stings, and bitterness of the Curse
to the utmost extremity. The Scripture saith he was made a Curse for us.
Although together with the Natural Principle, he took not the Corruption,
yet he took the Curse. You that read, or hear this, prepare your selves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Relation of Divine Love, which will at once break your hearts, and
make them whole again: That God, who is Blessedness itself, the purest
Light of Life, Joy, and Glory in Person, cloaths himself with Flesh, even
with the Fleshly Spirit, and Principle, that he may make himself a Curse for
your sakes, in your stead. Thus he receives immediately into his own Person, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own Breast, and Heart, all the stings of the Curse, of Separation, of Loss, of
Shame, of Pain, of Guilt, of Grief, of Horrour, Amazement, Death. All these stings
he receives into himself, as they are dipt all over in the most unmixt, and fier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
Poison of the Divine Wrath. All these stings he felt at once, enveno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with Wrath in the tenderest, and most sensible manner, with the
quickest, and sharpest sense. Never was, never can there be such a sting, such a
sense of any sting in the Spirit of Man, or Devil, or any Creature. Do we
hear all this, and that all this was from love to us, and are we not by a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
of love wounded with a sense of those stings, which thus stuck in our
Saviours Heart? Do we not feel our hearts wounded with a sense of those
Sins of ours, which fixed those stings there? But doth not this sense also fall
like drops of precious Balsom upon our Hearts to heal those wounds immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
or to turn them into Fountains of Love, and Joy, when we hear, that
it was Love, and infinite Love in the Heart of God himself, which took these
stings out of our low, and wretched Persons, to fix them in that most High,
and Glorious Person, which is Eternal Love, and Life itself? He was made
Sin for us, that is, a Sacrifice for Sin in a flame of Wrath in our stead, that
we might be made the Righteousness of God in him, to ascend in the Bosom
of his glorified Person in a pure flame of Love, Delight, and Glory above all
Heavens.</p>
               <p>4. Propos. This our Jesus, as he at the same time with his Divine Nature
in his Humanity, stood in a supernatural, and eternal Principle, he in his
Humanity comprehended his Humanity itself in its natural Principle, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:49838:251"/>
with the natural Principle itself, the Curse, all the stings, and bitterness
of the Curse in a Light of Divine Glory, in a Life of Divine Love, as so
many varieties of pure Love, Joy, and Glory with immortality. Our Jesus,
at the same time in his natural Principle, and in his Flesh was encompassed
with a blackness of darkness, and was filled with the bitterness of the Curse;
at the same time in his supernatural Principle, the Eternal Spirit, even in
the natural Principle in the Flesh, in the midst of the darknesses, &amp; bitternesses
he saw them all, he conversed with them, he tasted them, feasted upon them,
enjoyed them, and himself in them, as the Light, and Sweetness of Heavenly
Love, as Roses, and Lillies, the Hony, and the hony-comb in the Paradise of
God, as the delicacies of Eternity, and a banquet of Wine in the Kingdom
of God. For he received, he saw, he rellished them in the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the will of his Father in them. Thus he speaketh of them, when
he cometh first into the World, <hi>I come to do thy Will, O God.</hi> All things,
which he met with in the World, and in Flesh were to him the pure, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Will of God alone presenting itself in so many various Forms, where the
Substance, and the Forms both were the same Will, like a Feast in several
Dishes, where the Meat, and the Dishes too are alike delicate food. So Christ
himself expressed it, <hi>John</hi> 4. It is my Meat, and Drink (a Divine Meat, and
a Divine Drink) to do the Will of my Father. All the sufferings, and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Christ, were an active accomplishment; an active entertainment
of the Will of the Father, of that Will, of that supream Will, which is
the pure Fountain, Measure, Essence, perfection of all Good, Loveliness,
Love, Sweetness, and Joy.</p>
               <p>The sufferings of our Lord Jesus appeared to him in a Spiritual Light, as
Heavenly Beauties cloathing his Person, making it so much the more lovely
in the Eye of his Father the truest Judge of loveliness, and Beauty. <hi>My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loves me,</hi> saith Jesus Christ, <hi>because I lay down my Life for my Sheep.</hi>
How sweet, and dear a sense hath the Lord Jesus of the Curse, and of Death,
when he had this sense of them, that they made him lovely to his Father, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
his Fathers Heart to him, and made him more in love with him.</p>
               <p>The blackest Cloud, that resteth upon Christ, discovered itself to his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Eye to be in truth a Glory surrounding him. All the griefs of his Heart
appeared to be Jewels of Glory, and Immortality hanging in his Bosom. For,
saith Christ, when he was now to suffer; now is the Son of Man Glorified;
and again, he saith, the Father is Glorified in the Son. O! how d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fferent is the
truth of things in the Spirit from the outward appearance in the Flesh?
When Jesus Christ was spit upon, Scourged, Crucified, as this World gives,
forms, and names of things, then in the sense, and language of Heaven of
Eternity, of the Eternal, and Spiritual Principle in himself, he was glorified;
all these were as so many fresh Lights of Glory, in which his Person shines
forth to itself, and to the Father, in which the Fathers Person shines forth in
his Person, as in a new Heaven with new, and increasi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Beauties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="473" facs="tcp:49838:251"/>
O you, that are Followers of Christ, what a mystery of Spiritual Joy, and
Heavenly Glory is there in the life of a Saint, if this be to be a Saint, to walk
on Earth, as Christ walked, that is, in a Spiritual Principle, in the midst of the
Natural Principle, and Fleshly Image of things governing, comprehending, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
handling, rellishing all in the Divine Light, Beauty, and Sweetness of the
Eternal Spirit? When the blackest Cloud of melancholy rests upon thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
when the sharpest Sword of Grief pierceth thy Heart, retire into thy
Spiritual Principle, there thou shalt be, as on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> the Mount of
Transfiguration, where the Face of thy God shall be as a pleasant Sun of
Joy, and Glory shining forth in its strength within thee, and the whole Image
of things in thee, and round about thee, as a Garment of Light all weaved,
and wrought with the freshest, and purest Beams of this Sun in all living,
and immortal Figures of the highest Joys, and Glories.</p>
               <p>5. Propos. The Curse with the stings, and sense of it upon the Natural,
and Temporary Principle, as also the conflict between the Natural, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary;
the Supernatural, and Eternal Principle in the Lord Jesus thorow
his whole Person, as it lived in a Humane Soul, and Body, were highest at his
Death. The Lord Jesus saith, the Prince of this World cometh: This is your
hour, and the power, or principality of Darkness. The Devil came now to
make his two last, and most furious assaults upon the Lord Jesus in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and upon the Cross. He therefore comes with all the powers of Darkness,
and Legions of Devils, with all the blackest, and most dreadful Furniture, and
force of Wrath from Hell below, from Earth, and Heaven above, as the
Prince of this World, and the Prince of Darkness. The Battel was so sore
against the Lord Jesus, that he himself, who was the Wisdom, and Power of
God was amazed. He, who was the eternal delights of his Father day by
day cries out, <hi>My Soul is very sorrowful even unto Death;</hi> The word in Greek
is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which signifieth an excess of sorrow, and a surrounding sorrow.
All things round about the Lord Jesus were hung with a blackness of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and amazing horrours, that he himself, who bears up the weight of all
things, could hardly sustain the weight of his own fears, and sorrows, or
sustain himself in Life under them. He falls beneath them to the ground. His
whole Person is so prest, and opprest with them, that through the agony of
his Spirits, the boiling blood is strained forth through all the parts of his
Body. He cries to his Father thrice: Angels are sent from Heaven to strengthen
him, and comfort him.</p>
               <p>But after this, the conflict upon the Cross was yet sharper. Now the Prince
of Darkness grows desperate, knowing that this is his last effort, and that now
at once he fights for his Kingdom, Liberty, and Life, that his whole Kingdom
of Darkness, and his Person too depend upon this one Fight. The Earth-quake,
the rending of the Rocks, the total Eclipse of the Sun, and the Universal
Darkness upon the face of the whole Earth were Types of what Christ the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:49838:252"/>
Prince of Glory, and the Devil the Prince of Darkness suffered in this last
Conflict; the like to which never was before, nor shall ever be. The whole
frame of things shook, and trembled under the Feet of the Lord Jesus, and
round about him. The Rocks, all the supports of his Soul, all the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Pillars of his strength, and life were rent in pieces, and dissolved.
The face of the Creature, the face of Heaven, the face of his Father were
all covered with a thick, a threatning, and an amazing Darkness, as in a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tempest above the course, and force of nature. The Lord of Life, in
whom all things subsist, is now sinking, and ready to give up all for lost.
How deeply was his Heart pierced, how cruelly wounded, how were every
glympse of Light, every drop of Comfort intercepted and with-held, when
he cried out; <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> What potent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment
from Hell was this, what power of Darkness, what infusion of
Wrath, what separation ten thousand times more bitter than Death, which
so wrought, that he, who is God himself, seems divided from himself, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
deserted by all the power, and sweet lights of the God-Head?</p>
               <p>Thus you see in this 5th Proposition the trouble of Christ at its height:
In the two following Propositions, you shall see, that notwithstanding this
dreadful storm in the evening, and latest hour of his life, this beautiful Sun in
his dying moment, as in the close itself of the day; casts up its cloud, comes
forth Triumphantly, and no night follows.</p>
               <p>Before we pass to the other Propositions, let us make a few short observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon these.</p>
               <p>1. See how dreadful, and hateful an evil Sin is by the effects of it in the
Person of God himself, our Lord Jesus. Let not that be a light thing to us,
which lay with so great weight upon him, neither let us be secure in our
Lusts, Vanities, Covetousness, Sloath, playing with these, which were so many
Serpents in the Bosom of Christ, and shot deadly stings into his Heart. Can
we stand under those things, which had almost sunk the Son of God into
despair, and Eternal Darkness? It is true God brings good out of the evil of
Sin, order out of its disorder, and reconciles all into a beautiful Harmony of
Divine Love, and Joy. But how? by how dear a price? by how precious an
atonement? by how costly, how cruel, how bloody a Sacrifice? by how vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a conflict between all the powers of light, and darkness at once? by how
dreadful a dissolution of the whole frame of things, with the blackest Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
of Divine Wrath from above? by what horrours of Death in its ugliest
shape, with its most venemous stings; and all this in the Person of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
our Jesus?</p>
               <p>2. Be good Soldiers of the Lord Jesus. Endure hardships. Endure the
fight of Sufferings. Think not strange to have the Clouds blackest, and the
Storm greatest with Thunders, and Lightnings round about you in your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
hour, in old age, and death. Thus you bear the Cross of Christ. Thus
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:49838:252"/>
you fight under the Banner of Love. A Husband in Bloods art thou to me,
saith the Wife of <hi>Moses</hi> to him, concerning the Circumcision. Jesus Christ
hath been a Husband in Blood to thee, O suffering Saint. Now art thou also
indeed a Sister, and a Spouse to him in Blood. This Life is the Season of suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
Christ suffered here. Can you not suffer with Christ one hour, the short
Season of this fleeting Life? Think how glorious in the Eyes of all the Holy
Angels, and of the Blessed Saints of Christ, and the Father you shall come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Heaven? How dear to the Bosom, and Embraces of them all, when you
come most covered with Dust, and Blood, when you come immediately out of
the greatest sufferings; when you come so much the lovelier, by how much the
liker you are to Christ; when Christ, and the Father have been so much the
more glorified in you; when they in their Glories have so much the more
clearly, eminently shined forth in your Persons, and rested upon them, by how
much the more extream your sufferings have been? When the Father hath
thus accomplished his will in you, what a Feast of Eternal Pleasures, what a
Crown of Eternal Glories will he make this will of his to you, how will he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
your will in himself to the utmost height of all delights, &amp; blessedness?</p>
               <p>3. See here a threefold comfort against sufferings, and Death.</p>
               <p>1. He, who hath conquered them is your Captain the Lord Jesus. We
read <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. That the Captain of our Salvation, being to bring many Sons
to Glory, was made perfect through Sufferings. There are four things in
that word <hi>Perfect.</hi> 1. There was a perfection of sufferings in all kinds, and
degrees. Nothing of any evil of sufferings in the evil of it was absent, or
could be added. 2. Jesus Christ perfectly endured these sufferings in the sense
of them, in the continuance under them, in pressures, and oppressions by
them. 3. He was a perfect Conqueror over them. 4. To be made perfect,
signifieth an initiation in Sufferings, as in Sacred, and Divine Mysteries. So
Christ was at once in his Sufferings the Priest, the Altar, the Fire, the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
the Temple, the God. This Jesus, thus a perfect, and a Divine Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
over all Sufferings, who holdeth all evil of Sin, and Sorrow, as Captives,
in Chains of Eternal Goodness, pure Love, Light, and Joy, He leads you
upon Sufferings; he goes before you into them; he turns them all into Holy,
and Heavenly Mysteries of Divine Life, and Love, and makes you in the
midst of them, as Priests, like <hi>Aaron</hi> in his Priestly Robes, and Ornaments,
and Anointings in the Temple of the Eternal Spirit.</p>
               <p>2. You, O Saints, have nothing to do in your greatest Sufferings, that you
may be Conquerors over them, but to abide in the Lord Jesus. He himself in
his dying discourses, thus comforts his Disciples in the Gospel of St. <hi>John; In
the World you shall have trouble, but in me you shall have peace, be of good
chear, I have overcome the World.</hi> Stand still, be stedfast, and unmoved in the
Lord Jesus; so shall you never have any other sight of your Enemies, or
Troubles, but such as the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> had on this side of the Red Sea,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:49838:253"/>
when they came forth with their Timbrels, and Dances. You shall see them
drown'd in the Sea of your Saviours Blood, in a Sea of Glory in his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
never to appear more in any melancholy shape. When thine Enemies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass
thee on every side, like mighty Floods, with greatest force and fury,
lie down upon thy glorified Saviours Bosom, as the Bed of Love, have his
high praises in thy mouth, sing aloud of his Love, his Loveliness, his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in his Death, his Resurrection, and return in the Spirit. So shalt thou see
all the powers of Darkness, Death, and Hell under thy Feet, bound in Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Chains of Love, Immortality, and Glory.</p>
               <p>3. Look forth now with a Spiritual Eye, and see, that Sufferings, and
Death are a name only, and empty shadows without any substance. The
things themselves are for ever destroyed by the Death of Christ, and buryed
in his Grave, never to rise more. A good Woman, a Martyr, being reproved
for going with joy to the Fire, when Christ was sad at the approach of Death,
answered; <hi>My Saviour was sad, that I might be joyful.</hi> Sufferings, and Death
are now to Saints, like Snakes, out of whom the Lord Jesus hath taken the
Sting, that we may take them into our Bosoms, and make them our soft, and
shining Play-fellows. They are become now in the Blood, and Spirit of Christ
like Vipers in Wine, which have lost their Poyson, and are high Cordials;
like Bees they have shot their stings into the Lord Jesus, and lost them there.
They have Hony now without any sting for thee to suck forth, and feed
upon.</p>
               <p>6. Propos. This Eternal Person, our Jesus with his God-Head in his whole
Humanity both Soul, and Body in the moment of Death by dying, went en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
forth from the Natural, or Temporary Principle, and so from under the
Curse. I shall open this by four Scriptures.</p>
               <p>1. Scrip. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20. The Lord Jesus is said to have con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>erated a new,
and living way for us to enter into the holiest through the Vail, that is, his
Flesh, <hi>Math.</hi> 27. 50, 51. You shall see, that as Jesus Christ yielded up the
Ghost, immediately the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain from the top to
the bottom. The Temple was a Figure of the Person of Christ, as the Vail
was of this Flesh. How particularly, and emphatically is it expressed, that the
Vail was rent from the top to the bottom, to its utmost extent in the Person of
Christ? The Flesh was as a Vail lying upon the Divine Beauties upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Person, and the Heavenly Image in the Soul, &amp; Body of Christ. The Flesh of
Christ was a dividing Vail, separating between the Lord Jesus, &amp; the naked Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the naked Bosom of his Father keeping his Soul, and Body, his blessed Person,
and Divine Nature, as they subsisted in his Soul, and Body out of the holiest,
out of the pure, and open Glories of the God-Head. As the Lord Jesus dies,
in that same moment this Vail is rent from the top to the bottom, from the
the highest part of his Soul, and Spirit to the lowest part, and appearance in
the Body. Now the Holiest, the Heavenly Image, the pure, and naked Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:49838:253"/>
of the Eternal Person, of the God-Head were opened, and discovered
thorow his whole Soul, and Body. His Soul, and Body both entered into the
Holiest, into this Heavenly Image, into these pure Glories in the unity of the
Eternal Spirit.</p>
               <p>2. Scrip. <hi>John</hi> 19. 30. When the Lord Jesus was now breathing his
last, he formed his last breath into these words, <hi>it is finished.</hi> As he spake those
words, he bowed his Head, and gave up the Ghost. What was that, which
was finished with the life of Christ? Not the work of our redemption. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great, and principal parts of that remained still behind, the Resurrection
of the Lord Jesus, his Ascension, his Intercession, his return in the Spirit at
the pouring forth of that his last Appearance, his Judgment, and Kingdom.
What then was that which was finished with the finishing of the life of
Christ? The days of his abode in the Flesh without the Vail; his Humiliation,
his Sufferings, the State of Nature, the Curse, the Wrath of the Father
were now finished; the Spirit, and Image of this world, the hour, and power
of Darkness, the bloody Fight with the Prince of Darkness, the Prince of
this World were now at an end, as the life of Christ ended.</p>
               <p>O you, who are followers of Christ, and predestinated to be conformed to
him in your Lives, and in your Deaths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meet Death with Joy, with the shout
of those, who cry out for victory. Now is your Warfare accomplished; now
is your Captivity in the Fleshly Spirit, and Image at an end. You shall dwell
now no more in <hi>Meshek,</hi> at a distance from the Divine Glory, nor sojourn in
the Tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> in the Land of Darkness. The Vail of the Flesh is now
rent from the top to the bottom thorow your whole Soul, and Body. In both,
as you seem to fleshly senses to enter into the shade of Death, you in that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enter into the Kingdom of Light, the Glorious Pallace of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Divine Beauties, and Joys of the Heavenly Image. You have now
fought the good Fight, and finished it. Henceforth from this moment it is,
that the Crown of Righteousness, the Crown of Life, and Immortality hath
been laid up for you to be set upon your Heads, and worn by you, which
God shall now give you from his own presence, from his own hand, in this
day of Glory, which now breaketh, and riseth upon you.</p>
               <p>3. Scrip. <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 15. The Apostle speaking of Christ saith thus; and
having spoiled Principalities, and Powers, he made a show of them openly,
and triumphed over them in it, that is, his Cross, which was mentioned in the
latter end of the foregoing verse.</p>
               <p>There are three parts in this Scripture, which is a glorious description of
the Victory of our Lord Jesus. 1. The Subject of his Victory. 2. The Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
itself. 3. The Seat of his Victory.</p>
               <p>1. The Subject of Christs Victory are Principalities, and Powers. The
first word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifieth Principles. The second word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, signifieth Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
Principalities, and a power of ruling. By these names the Angels
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:49838:254"/>
are expressed, as they are the Invisible Springs, out of which all visible
things continually flow; as they are the Supream Glories, Virtues, Powers,
among things created, to which this present world is subjected, by which it is
enlivened, enlightned, formed, acted, and ruled. Thus the Victory of Christ
extendeth itself over the whole Creation, the whole frame of Nature in its
Heavenly, Angelical, and unseen part; in that which is Earthly, and visible;
in the Fountain-Glories, and flowing Streams; in the Princes on high, and
their Principalities beneath.</p>
               <p>2. The Victory itself is exprest in three steps. 1. The Spoil. 2. The
Show. 3. The Triumph.</p>
               <p>1. The Spoil. He spoiled Principalities, and Powers. The word signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to uncloath. The Lord Jesus, as a conquering Prince, uncloathed the
Invisible Princes of this World of all Power, Principality, and Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
by which means the whole Creation, and the frame of Nature, which
stood by these Powers, in these Appearances, according to their first, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
State, were dissolved, fell into the depths of Darkness, and confusion,
disappearing for ever.</p>
               <p>2. The Show. Our Victorious Saviour brought forth all the Principles,
Powers, and Appearances of Nature, into the open light of the Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
There he led them as Captives through the Streets of the Heavenly <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
showing them, as the subjects, and marks of his Victory to all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable,
and Glorious Inhabitants of that Blessed City of the great King.</p>
               <p>3. The Triumph. He Triumphed over them. All natural Powers, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Lives, and Images lay beneath the Feet of the Lord Jesus, as his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool,
while he sat down upon a Throne of Glory, cloathed all over with
Garments of Glory, and wearing a Crown of Glory upon his Head. These
are the three Parts of Christs Victory.</p>
               <p>3. The Seat of Christs Victory was his Cross. He Triumphed on it. Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
this all ye, that are one Seed, one Spirit with the Lord Jesus, that are made
conformable to his Death in your Lives, and Deaths. Hear this; let it be
written upon your Hearts in Characters of Glory with a living Beam from
that bright Sun, the Face of our Lord Jesus, as he shines in the Eternal
Glory of his most Blessed Victory, and Triumph. It was upon his Cross, it
was upon his Cross, that the Lord Jesus spoiled, made a Show of, Triumphed
over the Principalities, and Powers of this World.</p>
               <p>Our Blessed Saviour, in dying, by dying, in that very moment, by that
very act, dissolves, and defaceth at once the whole frame of Nature, and of
the first Creation. He taketh away from it all Power of being, subsisting,
acting, or appearing. He blotteth out every natural Image, and form of
Light, or Darkness; Life or Death, Beauty, or Deformity; Shame, or Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
Grief, or Joy for ever. You have this excellently painted out in a clear
Prophesy, <hi>Psalm. 73. 20. As a Dream, when one awaketh; O Lord, when
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:49838:254"/>
thou awakest, thou shalt despise their Image.</hi> The word Image signifieth a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
The Eternal Word, the Heavenly Image, our Lord Jesus was in this
Creation, as under the Vail of Darkness, and Night; as in a sleep. He bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth, and beareth up all the Powers, and Forms of Nature, as a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eam
in this sleep, and as shadowy Images in this Dream. By dying he awakes out of
this sleep, he sets an end to this Dream. The whole frame of Nature with
all Forms, and Images of things within the vast compass of it either Visible,
or Invisible, break up, fly away, and vanish, as a Dream, as the
shadowy Images in a Dream, when a Man awaketh.</p>
               <p>But neither are they quite lost. They only change their Principle, and
Appearance. In the same dying moment doth the Lord Jesus, who is that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,
and Essential Image, in whom they all subsist, appear, and pass thorow
their several changes, carry them with himself into the Divine Light, and Life
of the Eternal Spirit. There are they seen again, as the Fruits of his Conquest,
spoiled of all their own Life, Light, and Form, having put on a new Life,
Light, and Form according to the Will of the Conqueror, to show forth his
Power and Glory, to make them pleasant, and Eternal Spectacles of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Triumph to all the Inhabitants of Heaven, and Eternity.</p>
               <p>Now, before he is taken down from the Cross, even upon the Cross itself,
the Lord Jesus, as he gives up his Spirit with his last breath, Triumphs in his
Soul, and Body too, whose proper Seat the Cross was: In both, cloathed with
Triumphal Robes of an immortal Beauty, and Blessedness, he rides forth in
the Glorious Chariot of the Heavenly Image, and of the Eternal Spirit. All
the Powers, and Forms of Nature, of Life, and Death, the Cross itself, and
the Crucifiers, as Captive; follow his Chariot, bound in the Golden Chains
of Divine Light, and Love, making up the delight, and Glory of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>
               <p>This also doth the <hi>Psalmist</hi> clearly Prophesy of, <hi>Psal. 68. 18. Thou hast
ascended up on high, thou hast led Captivity Captive.</hi> The descent of our
Lord Jesus was finished with his Life. He begins his ascent upon his Cross the
first moment of his Death. This World, with all its Powers, and Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
the life of this World, the Cross itself, and Death, which had so long cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated
the Lord Jesus with all the Powers, Beauties, Joys, and Glories of his
Heavenly Image, binding them in Chains of Darkness within the Dungeon of
this Earthly Image, whose light is darkness, are now themselves in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our Lord Jesus, in his Soul, and Body, together with his Captivity it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
carryed up, as he ascends, and made Captives to that Heavenly Image,
which they held Captive. Here, in this Pallace of the Spirit, and of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
where Darkness itself shines, as the Light, they are seen, as the Captives
of the Lord Jesus, bound in Chains of Glory, spectacles to all the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and Blessed Spirits, in which the Beauties of Christs Victory, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
as so many ravishing Wonders of an Incomprehensible, of a Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:49838:255"/>
Power, Wisdom, Love, Glory, Divinity, subduing all things entirely to
themselves, eternally shine.</p>
               <p>This honour have all the Saints in their Deaths, by the vertue of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
Death, by vertue of their fellowship with him, and his fellowship with
them mutually in their several Deaths, all in each Death dying together.
Where now is the Melancholy of Death, and of the Grave? It is swallowed
up into the Divine Pomp, and Pleasure of a most Glorious Victory, and
Triumph. O Saint! What fearest thou in Death? Or thou, who fearest not
to be dead why fearest thou to die? If thou rejoicest in the Glory of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
Soul, why mournest thou over thy Body, as left behind in a naked,
and loathsome Prison? The act of dying to both is the gaining of a Glorious
Victory over the Life, and Death; the Powers, and Principalities of this
whole World. The passage itself out of this Life is a Glorious Triumph to
thy Soul, and Body both, which, with all the Triumphal Ornaments of the
Light of Life, and Immortality, ride forth in the Chariot of the Heavenly
Image, and the Eternal Spirit over the Spirit, and all the forms of this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which lie conquered under your Feet.</p>
               <p>In the very moment of your dying, all the Powers, and Appearances of
Nature, which rule in the Kingdoms of Sense, and Reason, are lost for ever;
so that their place, where once they reigned in your Persons, knows them no
more. You sit down upon the Throne of Christ, and the Father together
with them. All the Births, Images, and changes of time are swallowed up
into the bright, the beautiful, the most delightful depths of Eternity, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable
depths of purest Light, Love, and Joy immediately; as Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Conquerors, and Kings, you are encompassed with the ravishing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauses,
and shouts of innumerable Angels, of Immortal, and Glorious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
springing up, and shining forth in all the places of this World, where its
Light, or Darkness Life, or Death seemed before to stand. You see all these
with a Heavenly Musick, and Songs of Triumph, setting Garlands, and
Crowns of Victory on your Heads immediately, as you pass out of the Light
of this Life, you see your selves received, your Souls, and your Bodies both,
with the most delicious kisses into the Eternal Embraces of the Father, and
of Christ, in that Unity of the Spirit, which is the unfathomable center of
all Lights, Loves, and Joys, of all beautiful, and blissful Spirits created, and
uncreated. All now for ever are filling full your Joys in themselves, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
their Joys in you.</p>
               <p>4. Scrip. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. That he by dying might destroy him, who had the
power of Death, that is, the Devil, and set them free, who all their life time
were subject to bondage by the fear of Death. The word Power, in this
place signifieth properly a Prince with a Principality, or Dominion. This
whole world is the Principality of the Devil. For the Devil is called in
Scripture the Prince of this world. All Flesh, every thing of Nature, and of
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:49838:255"/>
this Creation is comprehended under that name, as it is distinguished from,
and opposed to the Spirit, and the new Creation in the Spirit, the Kingdom
of God in the Holy Ghost, and is the Principality of the Devil. All Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
every shadow, every evil of Sin, or Suffering; of Corruption, and the
Curse; of Shame, Deformity, Pain, Grief, and Wrath, as all these are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the Scripture, and in common Language, with every other kind, or
degree of Evil, by Darkness, are the Principality of the Devil. For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is called the Prince of Darkness. Death is the Devils Principality, who in
this Scripture is called the Power, or Prince of Death. All this then hath Jesus
Christ by dying destroyed in his own Person, this World; the Principles, and
Forms of Nature; the Life, and Images of Flesh; every Darkness inward, or
outward, of mind, or sense; Death itself. For all these lie within the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality
of the Devil, and are his Region, his Kingdom; without the bounds of
this Dominion all things are Light, Life, Love, Joy, Immortality, Spirit, and
Truth.</p>
               <p>As it is Jesus, who dies again in the Death of every Saint; as the Death of
every Saint is the Death of Christ acted over again in the similitude, by the
vertue of his Death: so doth every Saint, as he is one Spirit with Christ, after
the like manner, by dying destroy the Principality, the Kingdom of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
in his Person also. For this is said to be the end of Christ in his Death,
that he might free all the Saints from the fear of Death. O Believers! Let
your Saviour gain his end upon you, and end of most tender Love. Be no
more in bondage to the fear of Death. Let the Lord Jesus see the seed of his
Death springing up in your Deaths, a Glorious, and Divine Seed of Life, and
Immortality springing up in the place of Death, and swallowing it up into
Victory. Lay aside now for ever those melancholy, and delusive Imaginations
of Death, as a separation of those tenderest Bosom-Friends, Soul, and Body;
a separation from your dearest Relations, and entertainments, the delights of
your Eyes; an extinguishing of the sweet Light of Life; a dismal solitude,
a perpetual Darkness; the Confinement of the Body to the nakedness, cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
streightness, and horrour of the Grave; Dust, Stones, and Bones cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it, and ratling over it; Worms feeding upon it; the Soul naked, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
taking its flight through a vast distance of empty air, and space to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place. These are the Forms, and Appearances of Death to the Dead on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Those, who follow Jesus Christ in that living, and shining way, in which
he went thorow Death, meet with none of these appalling, and affrightful
Apparitions. <hi>Let the Dead bury their Dead,</hi> saith Jesus Christ to his Disciples,
<hi>but follow thou me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Understand this, O Believers, that all Shadows, all Forms of Darkness, and
of Death are from below, Earthly, Sensual, Devilish, from the Earth, from
the Natural Soul, and from the Devil, as St. <hi>James</hi> speaks. All this Image,
and sense of things is that Kingdom of the Devil, which together with the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:49838:256"/>
King himself, which the Lord Jesus by dying, in himself, in thee, hath ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
destroyed in his own Person, in his own Death, and in thine by the
vertue of his own. As an Inchantment, so is this whole Frame, and Form of
things dissolved, so doth it vanish at the going forth of thy last breath. If
thou seek now for the region of Shadows, and the Land of Darkness thou
findest it no more for ever, as he that would seek for the Night, the Nightly
Shades, and Forms of things when the Sun is once risen. Let thy Soul, and
Body both then rejoice together, and rest in this assurance, that in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
out of this Life, in the passage of Death they shall meet with nothing
of loss, nothing uncouth, nothing unpleasant, nothing of Darkness, of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
of Death, of the Devil; but the most beautiful, and blessed Face, the
most dear, and delightful Embraces of the Lord Jesus, as a Glorious Lover, as a
Heavenly Bridegroom immediately presenting himself, immediately receiving
them. In the same moment do all things here disappear, and all things appear
again, as they are reconciled into a most ravishing Harmony of Divine
Beauty, and Love: As they are gathered up into their Head, into their first
Glory, their Eternal Unity in the Glorified Person of Christ.</p>
               <p>7. Propos. This same Jesus in his whole Person, with his whole Soul,
and Body, in the moment of Death, by dying went forth entirely into the
simplicity, and singleness of his Supernatural, and Eternal Principle, and so
into a State of pure Eternity, unmixt Joy, and Glory.</p>
               <p>I shall endeavour to explain, and confirm this Proposition by the fuller ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a Scripture, which I have often touched.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Psalm.</hi> 16. 9, 10. 11. Thus we read: <hi>Therefore my heart is glad, my Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
rejoiceth, my Flesh also shall rest in hope. For thou wilt not leave my Soul in
Hell; neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption. Thou wilt show me
the path of Life; in thy presence is the fulness of Joy, at thy Right Hand are
Pleasures for evermore.</hi> This is a Prophesy of Christ in his Death. <hi>David,</hi> as
a Prophet, speaketh concerning Christ, and in the Person of Christ. So St.
<hi>Peter</hi> interpreteth, and applieth this Scripture. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 25.</p>
               <p>This then is the Triumph of Christ in Death, over Death, which Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
consisteth of four Parts. 1. The Subject. 2. The Triumph. 3. The
Ground. 4. The manner of the Triumph.</p>
               <p>1. The Subject of Christs Triumph. This is threefold. 1. The Soul.
2. The Glory. 3. The Flesh of the Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>1. The Soul. This seemeth to be that unseen, and principal part of the
Natural Man, which in our common language is opposed to the Body, as the
Visible and inferiour part.</p>
               <p>2. The Glory hath a twofold acception. <hi>Davids</hi> Harp, and his
Tongue, were his Glory upon two accounts; both, as he was a sweet
Singer, a most skilful Musitian; and also as he was the sweet Singer of <hi>Israel,</hi>
as his Harp, and Tongue recorded the Praises of God, and made all things
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:49838:256"/>
round about him to resound the perfections and loves of the Lord Jesus. Thus
the Tongue of Christ was his Glory, as he is the sweet Preacher in <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
the Heavenly Interpreter, one of a thousand, who sheweth to Man
his Righteousness, and his rest. But again this Glory in <hi>David</hi> was the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Man, the birth of the Spirit, the Seed of God, the Life of Christ, Christ
in <hi>David.</hi> This Glory in Christ was the Spiritual Man, the Heavenly Image,
the Divine Nature, the God-Head. For so <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. Jesus Christ is said to be
the brightness of the Glory of God, as he is the express Image of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and Substance.</p>
               <p>3. The Flesh of Christ is his Body, as it is distinguished from the Soul,
and is covered with a Vail of Flesh, under which Vail it contains within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
those other two, the Soul, and the Glory. This is the threefold Subject
of the Triumph; the Natural Body, the Natural Soul, the Eternal Spirit, as
it inhabiteth in these.</p>
               <p>2. The Triumph itself is exprest in those four words; Gladness, Joy, Rest,
and Hope. Gladness is the same with Joy. The State of Blessedness in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Eternity is expressed by Joy. The Lord Jesus saith to the Good, and
Faithful Servant; <hi>Enter thou into thy Masters Joy.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which we have here in believing, and loving the Lord Jesus, which is
Heaven upon Earth; a Joy Glorious, and unspeakable. As our Lord Jesus
dyed, the Humane Soul of Christ before imprisoned in a Fleshly Body, went
forth to be comprehended, and swallowed up in that Joy, which it could not
take in, nor comprehend, because it was boundless, and infinite. His Divine
Nature, which in this Humane Soul, together with it, had been vailed by an
Earthly Body now breaks forth and shines out into the freedom, and full liberty
of its own unconfined delights, and unvailed Glories. My Soul, saith Christ,
is glad, and my Glory rejoiceth.</p>
               <p>The Triumph of Christ in his Body, and his Flesh is set forth by Rest,
and Hope. which two words import Life, Sense, a Sweetness, and fulness of
Life, and Sense with Immortality.</p>
               <p>The Sabbath in the beginning of the Creation, as it figureth the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Sanctified, and blessed State in Christ, and in Heaven, is expressed by
Rest, the name Sabbath signifieth Rest.</p>
               <p>The Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as it was a Land of Rivers, and Springs, and floods
of Water; as it was a Land flowing with Milk, and Hony, and so a Type of
that good Land, that flourishing Land of the Spirit, and of Eternity, where
the Fountains, and full floods are of all Divine Goodness, and Truth, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by Rest. <hi>Joshua,</hi> who gave the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> is said
to give them Rest.</p>
               <p>That perfect Cessation from all trouble, that perfect Consummation of
our Happiness in the quieting of all our desires by the full accomplishment of
them, that terminating of all our motions to good in their most wished for
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:49838:257"/>
end, the chief good, which the Lord Jesus, which the Gospel, which Faith
bringeth us to in an immediate, entire, eternal Union with God; all this the
Holy Ghost expresseth by Rest. <hi>Come to me, and I will give you Rest,</hi> saith
the Lord Jesus. <hi>He that believeth, entereth into Rest,</hi> saith the Epistle to the
<hi>Hebrews.</hi> Thus the Body, and Flesh of Christ rest in Death. These are the
words, as he dies, in his Song of Death: <hi>My Flesh also doth rest in hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hebrew word for Hope, signifieth two things, Confidence, and Hope.</p>
               <p>Confidence implies a double certainty. 1. A certainty in the object, which
is the good in prospect, or in possession; hoped for, or already enjoyed. 2.
The certainty of the Subject, which is a sweet, a deep, a clear Sense, and Seal
upon the Soul of the certainty of the object, of the certainty of that Good,
which it hath in fruition, or expectation. This twofold Certainty maketh
that confidence, or assurance which compleateth, or crowneth the Souls Rest.</p>
               <p>In this confidence doth the Flesh of the Lord Jesus rest in Death. It hath no
more for ever any Conflicts, or Allarms. It is overspread with a sweet, and
clear Heaven. It breaths in a gentle, and delicious air, where there is no
storm, no rain, nor cloud. It is in a State of immutable joys, where there is no
Death, no Shadow of Death, no trouble, no fear, no shadow of fear, or any
such thing. All things sing an eternal <hi>requiem,</hi> and rest to it.</p>
               <p>As the Flesh of the Lord Jesus resteth in Confidence; so it resteth also in
Hope. Hope is good in prospect, or in progress, At our first conversion the
Eternal day breaketh upon us. While we live on Earth in a State of Grace
we have sweet, and clear streaks of the Light of Life appearing thorow our
Spirits, which still grow clearer, and brighter unto a perfect day. But all this
while there are dark, and black shades of the Night, Sins, and Sufferings
every where mingled with the pure Light of this blessed Day. At Death it
is perfect Day. The shadows of the Night are perfectly drunk up into the
rising Light, that now they appear no more in dark Forms, but are seen only,
as by a lovely temperature with the Light, they make beautiful, and pleasant
colours of Saffron, and of Roses. In the Resurrection the body of the Sun,
the Eternal Sun, the Lord Jesus, in the Glory of his God-Head ariseth upon
Soul, and Body both, and is nakedly seen, nakedly enjoyed, without the Vail
of any dark, and nightly shade, or any Floury, Spicy, or morning shade.
From the Resurrection to the utmost point of the ascention, this Divine Sun
is rising higher, and higher in Glory upon us, till he comes to that Noon-sted
of Eternity, and of the God-Head, where there is no more any ascent, or
descent, where the Unity is entire, where god is one, and that one God is all
in all. In the Confidence, and full assurance of this Hope doth the Flesh of
our dying Saviour, and of every dying Saint rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But you may say, we have formerly seemed to affirm according to
the Language of the Scripture, that the days of Christ on Earth before his
Death, were alone the days of his Flesh; that the Flesh of Christ was a Vail
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:49838:257"/>
upon his Body, which was rent in Death; that it was not the substance of his
Body, nor its true, proper, and natural Form; but a darkning, and dividing
Form, in which the Body of Christ appeared, and with which it was cloathed
in the State of fallen Nature, in the State of his Humiliation, in his Earthly
State. This State ended, this Form was put off in Death. How then had the
Flesh of Christ a part in his Triumph? How did the Flesh of Christ rest in
Hope?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> In a Garden of Flowers by night, the Flowers are seen in dusky, and
dark Forms, while the shades of the night lie upon them, as Vails upon their
Beauties. When the bright day riseth upon this Garden, the Flowers appear
in their naked, and shining Beauties, in their proper and lovely Figures; their
dark appearances, together with their darkning vails the shades of the night,
are drunk up, and transformed into the brightness of the Rosy morning. The
Body of the Lord Jesus, and of all his holy Ones, are the immortal Flowers,
Flowers of the Heavenly Paradise. Their Fleshly Form is the shadow of the
night upon them, their dim, and dusky appearance thorow this Shadow. Death
is the lovely, and rosy Morning of the Eternal Day rising upon them. The
Spirit of Glory, and of God is the brightness of this Day. The Flesh is now
changed into Spirit, the dusky appearance thorow the Vail of Flesh into a
Spiritual, and Heavenly brightness. In this brightness these bodies, of which
we spake, shine forth in their naked, native shapes, and Beauties, from all
parts they shed a Divine Lustre, they breath a pure sweetness of Divine Joys,
like the Flowers of the Spring in a fair morning. Thus the Flesh of Christ
resteth in Death.</p>
               <p>3. The ground of this Triumph is the inseparable union between the
God-Head, and the whole Humanity of Christ living, or dying, These are
the words of the Lord Jesus by his Spirit in the mouth of <hi>David: Thou
wilt not leave my Soul in Hell.</hi> Expositors agree, that the word Hell signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not a place of torments according to the common acception, but the
State of Soul, and Body in Death. The Greek word, by which it is rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the New Testament is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which by its notation signifieth the State of
things Invisible, or the Invisible State of things.</p>
               <p>It is also well known that the Soul in the language of the Old Testament
is not used to express only one part of a Man, but the whole Person.</p>
               <p>It is a Maxim in Divinity laid down by all learned, and holy Men, that
when the Natural Union between the Soul, and Body of our Lord Jesus cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Death, the Supernatural, and Hypostatical, or Personal Union between
the Divine, or Humane Nature in both parts of it remained inviolable, and
entire. Thus it is frequently said, that although the Soul of Christ was sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from his Body in the Grave, yet the God-Head was never separated
from either. O sweet and sure truth! A Spring of Holy, Heavenly, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Joys in Life, and in Death. This Truth rightly understood is a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:49838:258"/>
Light, which discovereth to us a Divinity in our Life here, Immortality
in Death, and Heaven in the Grave. This Divine Truth is the rich ground
of our dear Saviours Glorious Triumph over Death in Death.</p>
               <p>There was a twofold band of Union between the Soul, and Body of
Christ while he lived in Flesh, one Natural, the other Supernatural.</p>
               <p>1. The Natural Union was that composition of soul, and Body, by which
he became a Natural Man, and had the true Forms, Substance, and Essence
of a Man, sprung from the first <hi>Adam.</hi> This band of union was broken in
Death, by which means the Natural Man now was no more for ever according
to its Natural State, and Principle, but vanished like a shadow, breaking up
into the Light of a Spiritual Glory.</p>
               <p>2. The Supernatural Union is that of the second Person in the Trinity,
which is the Eternal God; who at the Incarnation of Christ made himself
Flesh, that is, a compleat Man, himself subsisting, as the single, and undivided
Person in this Man, in both parts of this Man, in Soul, and in Body, giving
in like manner a personal subsistence to them in himself, that the Divinity, and
the Humanity in its Soul, and in its Body both were all one simple individual,
indivisible Person. This is that, which Divines call the Hypostatical, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Union in Christ, which remained firm, and altogether unimpaired in
Death itself.</p>
               <p>See now the beautiful, and delightful consequences of this Union. The
Soul, and Body of Christ continued immediately, intimately sweetly, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly
united upon the Cross, in the Grave, were both one Immortal, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Person, by the Heavenly, and Personal Union in, and with the Eternal
Word. Soul, and Body were separated in respect to their Natural Union, and
Composition. All the Relations, and Delights of both; all the precious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
all the clear Images, and Lights of Life with the sweet life itself vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and fled away, so far as they were founded upon the Natural Union,
the band being broken, which tyed them all together in one, at the dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Union. But all these still dwelt together undivided, still possessed,
and enjoyed one another after the most intimate manner without allay, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
in the Unexpressible, and Glorious Unity of the Eternal Word the
Second Person in the Trinity. This Unity was a Divine Band, an undivided
Center, a living Spring, an unfathomable depth of Loves, and Glories, where
they lay perpetually enfolded in the warm embraces each of other, covered
with all the sweetest Lights, and Beauties even upon the bitter Cross, and in
the cold Grave never to be divorced from each other. Separation itself was
here only a various, and delightful form of embracing in the Unity of this
Eternal Person.</p>
               <p>4. In the fourth, and last place follows the manner of the Triumph
This hath three parts.</p>
               <p>1. The Triumph over Corruption, exprest in these words; <hi>Thou shalt not
suffer thy holy One to see Corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:49838:258"/>
2. The Triumph of Life, <hi>Thou wilt shew me the path of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. A Triumph in the Pleasures of Life, <hi>In thy Presence is fulness of Joy, at
thy Right Hand Pleasures for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The first part in the manner of the Triumph is the Triumph over
Corruption. <hi>Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see Corruption.</hi> The Triumphant
Person here is the holy one of God, the holy Son of God, the pure Seed, Birth,
and Image of God, Jesus Christ in his Divine, and Humane Nature, as he is
in both the Holy One of God, the Holy Birth, and Son of God, Jesus Christ
in himself; Jesus Christ in <hi>David, David</hi> in Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ in the
Holy Soul, and Holy Body of every Member of Christ, as they are the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Births, and Spiritual Temples of the Holy Spirit. This is the Person,
which Triumphs in Death.</p>
               <p>That which he Triumphs over is Corruption. There is a complication of
four Evils in Corruption. 1. Division, or Dissolution, which is the chief, and
the Root of the other Evils. 2. Darkness increasing. 3. Deformity over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreading.
4. Decay, which is a tendency to a destruction of Being, or to a
contrariety in Being, to all the good of Being. Over all these Evils of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
Jesus Christ Triumpheth, as he dyeth.</p>
               <p>1. Jesus Christ Triumpheth over Division, or Dissolution in Death. The
Eternal Unity of his Divine Person was at once, as a Root, and a Band to
both his Natures, to both parts of his Humane, Nature, to all the Powers,
and parts of his Soul, and Body, to the several Elements in his Body, to all
Perfections of Glory, Grace, and Nature in all Powers, and Parts of the
Humane Soul, and Body. All were, as an Immortal Nosegay, or a Mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Knot of Divine Flowers ever inseparably united in this Band, ever unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
flourishing in this Root of the Hypostatical Union, or the Divine U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Eternal Person, which was indissoluble in Death itself. Yea those
Separations, which are Natural, and necessary in Death, were themselves
Flowers of the Heavenly, and Earthly Paradise bound up with this Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Band in this ever-fair, ever-fragrant Nosegay.</p>
               <p>2. Jesus Christ dying, Triumpheth over the gloomy horrours of the increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
darkness, which ariseth from the hateful Womb of Darkness in the
dreaded vaults of Death. The Divine Nature, which is inseparable from the
Humane Nature, the Personal Unity, which is really, and substantially one
with the Divine Nature, which gives a subsistence in itself to the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and makes it in its Personal subsistence one with the Divine; this is a
brightness of Glory shining in the Grave, this is a Golden Candlestick, in
which all the seven Lamps of God burn continually by day, and by night
before the Throne of God, and make the vaults of Death themselves a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Gold, and Christal filled with the sweet Beams of the Heavenly, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Sun. All things, even Death, and the darkness of Death are as precious
Stones set together in the rich Jewel of this Person, or Hypostatical Union,
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:49838:259"/>
where no one Stone contracts the least degree of dimness, but all in the
midnight of Death itself ever sparkle with the sweetest, and clearest water
of Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>3. The deformity of Death, as it springs up out of the Corruption in
Death, is the subject of our dying, and dead Saviours Triumph. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Image of the God-Head, which is the supream Beauty the Arche-type,
and first Pattern of all Beauties upon the Mount of Eternity, is the Person
of Christ, in which the Divine, and Humane Nature with all its changes of
Life, and Death stand, and subsist together. Can any thing be deformed in
Beauty itself? Can any thing be Unlovely, where the highest, and purest
Loveliness shines thorow all, and over all? What must the Harmony, what
must the amiableness, and agreeableness be; how exact, and ravishing, as in
Heaven itself there, where the Supream Unity, the most Sacred Unity of one
of the most blessed Persons in the All-glorious Trinity, diffuseth itself thorow
all the variety of things, Divine, and Humane, of Soul, and of Body, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up all by itself immediately into the most perfect, and Divine Order, and
gathering up all into one most perfect, and Divine Person in itself? How
High, and Glorious is the Triumph of Divine Beauty over the deformity of
Death, when thus the Eternal Beauty itself dies, dressing itself up in the
Forms of Death, and giving to Death its own most lovely Face, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
the highest Angels, and God himself with Eternal, and Infinite Loves?
In the place of Deformity, what potent, what attractive charms of Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
hath this Death to ravish Souls into the bosom of it, which are thus to
die by a Fellowship with the Lord Jesus, as he dies?</p>
               <p>4, The last Evil in the Corruption of Death is the decay, which is a Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to a Nothingness, a Privation, the destruction of the being of things, or to a
contrariety to all good in Being. This is that dark Cave, that bottomless Pit, out
of which, like the smoak of Hell, like gastly, black, and flaming apparitions
from Hell, the deepest, and darkest Melancholy, the most dismal Horrours,
and the most horrid Imaginations from the sense, and fear of Death issue forth,
and cover the face of the Soul, as pitchy, and stormy Clouds cover the Face
of Heaven. How does the dying Soul dread to be cast forth into the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Darkness to be dispossest of itself together with all thigns? To be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessly
sinking in an abyss, or bottomless deep of a vast emptiness, and a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
formless shade? to be no more? or to be in the midst of all the wounds,
and torments that Being is capable of? to be consuming so, as ever to wish
it as the only medicine of ones evil, and ever to fear it, as the greatest of all
Evils, as the most incomprehensible Evil, to be no more?</p>
               <p>How sweet, and delightful was the Triumph of our Lord Jesus over this
Monster, which stands with so grim, and frightful a look in the Gate of Death?
O Corruption! O Decay! O Destructions! where is your Victory? Jesus
Christ comes into the empty, and obscure shades of Death with the fulness
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:49838:259"/>
of the Godhead with all the Lights of the Divine Nature, of Angelical, and
created Glories, of Heaven, and Eternity, with their full splendours shining
together all at once in the Unity of his Divine Person. This Person, which is
the Fulness, that filleth all in all, which is the Brightness that shineth eternally
in the Divine Essence, now filleth the whole space o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Death, now enlighteneth
it thorough-out, now becometh the stage, and Scene of Death, supporting it
on his delicious Bosom, bounding it with his bright, and blissful Beams. Where
is the emptiness, where is the shade, where is the bottomless Pit of Dread, &amp;
decay in Death? They are all swallowed up into shining, full, &amp; substantial
Glorys in this Triumph of our Saviour over Death. These are the Evils of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
in Death, over which Christ triumphs.</p>
               <p>See row the height of this Triumph. <hi>Thou wilt not suffer thy Holy One to
see Corruption.</hi> Jesus Christ passeth so triumphantly through the Regions of
Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Corruption loseth not onely its force, but its appearance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his
presence. Jesus Christ seeks for the place of Corruption, and finds it no more.
Thou, O God, wilt not suffer thy Holy One to see Corruption. The God-head
itself, the Divine Person of Christ, the Divine Nature inseparable from
that Person goes before the Lord Jesus, as a Guide, when he passeth through
this waste Wilderness. It cometh behind him, as a Rearward of Glory. It
encompasseth him on every side with its highest Brightnesses, and Blessednesses.
It suffereth him to see nothing but Itself on every side of him. The living, &amp;
shining Glorys of his God-head are Light, and Eyes to his dead Body in the
Grave. With these, and with these alone his Divine Person now looketh forth
thorough his Body in the Grave, thorough the Grave, to the utmost bounds
of the Regions of Death. In this Light, to these Eyes all things near at hand,
and afar off throughout, are a shining Prospect of Living Beauties to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
This Divine Light, and these Divine Eyes are a Divine Flame, which
in a moment, in the twinkling of an Eye break up all Shades of obscurity,
fill all space with their own Brightnesses, transform all Shapes even Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Death into the same Divine Forms with themselves to the utmost
bound of things. Thus God suffereth not his Holy One to see Corruption.</p>
               <p>2. The second part is the manner of the Triumph: the Triumph of Life
is expressed in those words; <hi>Thou shalt sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w me the Path of Life.</hi> There
are here two remarkable Triumphs over Death, 1 Life in Death; 2. The
sight, and Triumphant sense of this Life.</p>
               <p>1. Life in Death is declared by the Path of Life, which is made for the
Lord Jesus thorough Death. <hi>Noah</hi> with his dear Relations, and all kinds of
Creatures kept dry, and safe in the Ark, while the fountains of the great Deep
were broken up from below, and the windows of heaven were opened from
above to cover all things with a Flood of Waters; the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> in
the Land of <hi>Goshen,</hi> wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>re there was Light, and Rivers of Water, while dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was upon the whole Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Rivers in it were turned into
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:49838:260"/>
Blood; the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> passing in a dry path thorough the Red <hi>Sea,</hi>
which overwhelmed the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>yptian</hi> King with his whole Army; the Three
Children with the similitude of the son of God walking in the midst of the fiery
furnace, which burnt their bands only, and devoured their enemies, which cast
them in, all these were Figures of Jesus Christ passing in a Path of life thorow
Death. The Lord Jesus himself in his Heavenly, &amp; divine form, as he is the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Image of his Father is his own Way, and Life thorough Death. This is the
Fountain of Life, and Eternity itself. This hath all Lives bound up in one, like
those innumerable Beams, which pour forth themselves through all things
in Heaven, and on Earth, united in the sun. Here Life riseth up in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Fulness, in its freshest, purest, and sweetest Streams, where all the strengths,
Beauties, and Joys of Life are at their greatest heighth. Thus the Godhead
in its Essential Image stands in every part, and point of the Humane Nature
of Christ dying, or dead. Thus it stands in every step, and point of its Way
through Death. Thus it makes it all, as a Fountain and F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ood of Life. As the
Milky way in Heaven, where innumerable Stars mingle their Beams into one
Path of Light: Such is the Way of Christ in Death, which is all a mixture, or
contexture of the innumerable Beauties, and sweetnesses of Life rising up fresh
from the innumerable springs of Life in the Bosom of this Heavenly Image,
which is Eternity, and the Divine Essence it self in its own substantial Form.</p>
               <p>2. The Triumphant sight, and sense of Life accompanys the Lord Jesus in this
Path of Life thorow Death; as is signified by those words, Thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> shew
me, or make me to know the Path of Life. As a Princely Bridegroom leading
his Royal Bride in his hand thorough delightful walks, when the spring is in
its prime, makes her to observe all the delights in the Walks, saying to her;
see, how pleasantly all things look; how sweetly Heaven and Earth smile
one upon another; how lovely the leaves, and blossoms are upon the Trees,
the grass, and the Flowers upon the ground; how pleasantly the birds sing in

with a flaming eye of Love, he saith to him; behold a new and large prospect
of Divine Lights, and all the Beauties of Life in Death; with what spicy
sweetness, and immortal perfumes the Spirit of Life, and Love, as the Air
of Paradise, and Heaven itself breaths upon all things here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

and Earth, the uncreated and the created Image of things reflect the same
Beauties, and sweetnesses one upon another, like the Living Face, and the Face
in a Chrystal Mirrou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? How do all glories in their lovelyest Forms, &amp; richest
Varieties, looking down from above, sprouting forth, and blossoming from
beneath, meet and kiss each other? How do Angels, how do Immortal, and
shining Spirits spring, and sing every where? How doth the Shade of Death
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:49838:260"/>
itself, mingling itself with all these, surrounding this Divine Light, &amp; at the same
time surrounded by it, give a solemn sweetning, and heightning to all, like the
Base string to the Musick of a Lute, making Death it self another Heaven di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the Heaven after Death, and contending with it for delightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Thus God the Father maketh Christ to see the Path of Light in Death.</p>
               <p>3. The third part in the manner of the Triumph, the Pleasure; In thy
presence are all pleasantnesses, and at thy right hand Pleasures for evermore.</p>
               <p>Three pleas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n things are here presented in one: 1. The Seat of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
2. The Perfection; 3. The Perpetuity of Pleasures.</p>
               <p>1. The Seat of Pleasure is the Presence, and right hand of God. The
Presence in Hebrew is the Face of God. The Son of God, The Eternal
Word. The Essential Form of God, and the Brightness of his Glory, is the
Face of God. <hi>Behold thou art fair, my beloved, yea thou art Pleasant, our
Bed is green;</hi> saith the spouse in the Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cles to Jesus Christ. He is that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Form, and naked face of the Godhead where all the Pleasantnesses of
the purest Beauties, Loves, and Joys, first spring, flourish and seat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
His Cheeks therefore in the same Book are said to be the Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds
of the most fragrant Spices, and persumed Flowers, where the highest
Beauties, and the highest sweetnesses are born, and married one to another,
and bring forth an endless race of Loves, and Delights. This Face of God,
in which all Loveliness, and Loves thus shine, and flame together is also set
with so many eyes, which continually behold, and rejoyce in their own Beauties
and Pleasantnesses. This Face, this Form of God is the Person, which subsists in
the Human Nature of Christ both Soul &amp; Body, which in itself gives a subsistance
to the whole Humanity of Christ living, and dying. Thus is it in the Grave
and in the dead Body of Christ, the seat of all Pleasantnesses, the Throne of
divine Beauty, &amp; of Love in Death. It is also as a thousand never sleeping, never
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umbring eyes, in this blessed Body, with which it uninterruptedly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates
in it self this Eternal face, and Form of God, this seat of Pleasantnesses,
which is its own Person, its own self in its personal Unity, and subsistence.</p>
               <p>The right hand of God is the Godhead in the strength, at the heighth of
Love, Power Majesty, and Glory, as it is above all heavens. Here are
Pleasures in their proper fear, in their greatest force, and fulness, as they tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
the joys themselves of all created Heavens. At this right hand of God
is Jesus in the Grave. By this right hand of God, which hath all pleasures ever
attending it, was he pleasantly led thorough the Shadow of Death: In the
Bed of Death this right hand of the most High embraced him, that he might
sweetly rest there in the midst of all the Pleasures of this Right Hand of his.</p>
               <p>2. The Perfection of Pleasures is exprest by these two names of Pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
and Pleasures. Pleasantnesses are the Objects of delight, or Pleasures in
the object. Pleasures are the Delights themselves in the fruition, and enjoyment
of those objects, or Pleasures in their Subject. The Subject, and the Object
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:49838:261"/>
uniting, and mingling, and transforming themselves variously by their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
mixtures in their union into one mutual life, and Form of Beauty, and
Love, make Pleasure, and delight. You have here all Pleasantnesses in the
Face of God, and so all Pleasures at the Right Hand of God.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jesus dying, and in death beholds the Face of God. In this
Face he at once beholds all pleasant forms and Forms of Pleasantness, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santness
of all Forms among Men, &amp; Angels in their first &amp; highest Patterns, to
which the most Glorious spectacles, and spirits of Men, or Angels, are obscure Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
and faint imitations. In this face he beholdeth pleasant Forms, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
for variety, and <hi>Glory,</hi> which never cast any the least shadow of
themselves, nor were capable of being in the least degree imitated in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of created excellencies. Death itself is a divine Marriage-bed, in which
Jesus Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ist receives all these pleasant Forms into his Bosom, as Lights of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
shining thick thorow the Cristal Temple of his pure, and sacred Body
in this Night of his Divine Death. He be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reth in his dead Body the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and Figures of them all with the Heavenly substances themselves in these
Impressions, and Figures like a seal of Gold fixed on Virgin-wax; his dying,
and dead Body is transformed into one Life, and Form with those Original
Forms of Pleasantnesses, being embraced by them, as by a Divine flame,
which makes it one pure flame of Pleasantness, and Pleasure with itself.</p>
               <p>3. The Perpetuity of the Pleasure; <hi>At thy right hand are Pleasures for

in the Person of Christ without any interruption: 2. The endlesness of those
Pleasures. Jesus Christ saith to his Father in one Place, thou leadest me by

out of Heaven into the Virgins Womb, out of the Womb into the
gloomy Light of this World, thorow this World, thorow Death, and the

               <p>There is one thing more in the duration of Christs Pleasures signified in

not he much more see the face of his Father in Heaven, while he is on Earth,

Before I leave this Subject, I will point out one Use and Application of it.
When a Voice came with Thunder to the Lord Jesus, declaring Love and
Glory from on high upon him; Jesus Christ saith to his Disciples, <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is Voice
came not for my sake, but for yours.</hi> In like manner these glorious things
are spoken of Christ in his life, and in his death, not for himself only, but for
all his Saints. Christ, and all the Saints, are one seed. To that one seed, to
all the Saints in Christ, to Christ in himself, and in all his Saints, are all the
Promises made.</p>
               <p>All those pleasant things which we have spoken of Jesus Christ, and of his
holy Body, in Death, are true of him, as his Humane Nature is joyned to the
Divine Nature in one Divine and Eternal Person, which is the most High
God. The same things are true in us also, who believe in him, by that Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Union, which joyneth us to the Lord Jesus in one mystical Person and in
the Unity of that Spirit, which is also the most high God, one with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Son.</p>
               <p>While we live, as Saints by the Faith of the Lord Jesus, we live not, but
Christ liveth in us, we live, and we are Spiritual only, as we are Spirits, the
Birth of the Eternal Spirit, and one Spirit with the Lord Jesus in his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from the Dead: All things in Heaven and on Earth, of Soul, and
of Body, of Life, and of Death are Spirit, and Life to us.</p>
               <p>It is true, that while we live on Earth, a fleshly Spirit, a fleshly Image, in
which Satan hath his Throne, have a part in us, not as our true selves, but
as our disguises, our diseases, our enemy, as evil Dreams in our sleep. These
of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>n prevail over the Spiritual Man in us, and captivate us to many sinful
Lusts, fears, and Griefs. But still the Spiritual man in itself, which is our
true self, puts them under its feet, and makes them Captives to the Light,
Love, and Immortality of the Spirit. The Spirit in us is like the Sua,
which, when we think it under a Cloud, or eclipsed by the Moon, is so only
to our Earthly Light, but in truth, and to itself it is upon its own Throne
of Light triumphantly above the Clouds, and the Moon, comprehending
them in the brightness of its own Glory.</p>
               <p>But besides this, in the moment of Death this fleshly Spirit, and Image is
for ever cast out of all power, and rule in a Saint, and is entirely subdued
to that pure, and Heavenly Spirit, which is the true Saint, which now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Saint. Christ is risen, all the Powers of evil subdued, captivated, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into mysteries of eternal Light, and Love in the Glorified Person of Christ,
by the Virtue of his Resurrection. A Believer living, and dying stands in
the Resurrection of Christ, is risen with him, in him. A Believer is married
to Christ as he is risen from the Dead. His Life, his Death thoroughout all
things of them both, are Divine Fruits of this marriage-bed, brought forth
in the Bosom of God, to God.</p>
               <p>Break forth then, O ye Saints, into singing, both living, and dying, tune
your last breath to this song of the Lamb, and say like him; <hi>I have set my
glorified Jesus, my Heavenly Bridegroom and the Father in him before me.
My glorified Jesus, my Heavenly Bridegroom, and the Father in him is at my
right hand; therefore shall I not be greatly moved.</hi> Therefore doth my Soul
rejoyce in Death, my Body also sweetly rests in the Grave, as in a Marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
in the midst of all Divine delights, as Flowers of Paradise strewed upon
it. It rests in the Bosom of my glorified Jesus my hope. This sweet, and
sure hope is he, that will never leave my Soul in the state of Death; nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his Holy One, his spouse, this Soul, or this Body, which he hath spoused,
as chast Virgins to himself, to see Corruption. No, no; my Bride-groom, with
all his Lights of Glory, and the Father of lights in him, will accompany this
Darling-Soul, and Darling-Body, his pair of Doves, which are to him as his
two eyes, through Death, and the Grave. There will he, filling all things
round about me with his shining Beauties, make me to see the Path of Life,
&amp; Immortality, all composed of innumerable Angels of Glory, or the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Glories of the Godhead, as the Milky way in Heaven is said to be
composed with innumerable Stars thick set. Thorow all the shades of Death
shall I behold all pleasantnesses in his Face shining forth upon me with a fresh
Glory, as a new Sun turning those Shades into a flowry, and perfumed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the Heavenly Paradise, I shall be continually at his right hand,
where pleasures are for evermore without mixture, interruption, or end. Thus
is his right hand, which is the heighth and Fountain of Life, and Pleasures,
the beginning of my Life, my strength, and guide in my way, my end in
Death.</p>
               <p>We have finished the answers to the objection against the Immortality and
Glory of the Body of a Saint together with the Soul in Death, which was
taken from the Body itself, and strengthened by the particular considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Body of Christ in Death, and in the Grave. We have finished
the distinction between the two Bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Heavenly Body of Christ, and the Temple of the Holy Ghost, as the
Soul is.</p>
               <p>We come now to the last objection, taken from the resurrection of the
Body at the last day, which seems to be without any sense, if our Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

This Objection is answered by the distinction of three eminent steps, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in the resurrection from the Dead. I shall take my ground, upon
which I shall build this answer, and distinction from <hi>St. John Chap. 11.

here comforting <hi>Martha</hi> mourning over her dead Brother: He propounds to
her the comfort, and Joy of his Resurrection. <hi>Thy Brother,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall rise
again.</hi> That, which would have been a present, and powerful Joy looked
upon with a Spiritual eye in a Light of Glory, becomes to <hi>Martha</hi> a faint,
and far distant Joy, while she looks upon the Resurrection a great way off, at
the end of the World. So she answereth the Lord Jesus: <hi>Yea, Lord I know,
that my Brother shall rise again at the last Day.</hi> The Lord Jesus scattereth
this Cloud of Flesh by shining out upon <hi>Martha</hi> in the Brightness and <hi>Glory</hi>
of his Heavenly, and Divine Person, as that Invisible and Eternal Sun, which is
at once the Fountain, and Treasury of all Lights, Lives, and Forms of things
in a state of Perfection, and unchangeableness. The Lord, as he shineth out
upon her annointeth the eyes of her mind with his Spirit, and the Light of his
appearance, to see him, as he is in the fulness of Glory, as the fulness of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God, and of all things dwelleth in him, as he is the same, and all things
in him are the same yesterday, to day, and for ever. <hi>I,</hi> saith he, <hi>am the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tion
and the Life.</hi> The latter of these is the cause, and demonstration of the
former. It will not seem strange to him, who seeth the Lord Jesus to be the
Life of all things, &amp; all things in their most exact distinction to be living per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
and Ete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of his Person, and Spirit, as in a secret Paradise, a Field of Light, and bliss
above the Heavens, and yet invisibly present every where; that he should
at his Pleasure bring forth things, which have disappeared here by Death, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
new appearances, as Resurrections from the Dead, and present them again
to our eye in the same Forme, in which they before conversed with them, not

                  </gap>antasms, or as empty Apparitions, but real, and Substantial. Thus to
<hi>Martha</hi> inlightned by this Spiritual Vision of Christ, it was easie to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that Jesus Christ could give her Brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> again out of his Grave,
living, into her Arms even at that present time.</p>
               <p>Having thus cleared my ground for my ensuing discourse by the opening

Resurrection from the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad.</p>
               <p>1. The first eminent step, or degree in the Resurrection from the dead is
Regeneration, which signifieth a new birth, a second birth, to be born again
of God, after the Death of that Life which we receive from him by our first
Generation, as Sons of God by the Creation.</p>
               <p>2. The Second eminent step, or degree in the Resurrection from the Dead
is the Natural Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:49838:263"/>
3. The last eminent step, and degree is the Resurrection of the Dead at
the last day.</p>
               <p>1. I shall begin with the first of these, that the difference between these th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e
Resurrections may more clearly appear. I shall lay it down in the form of a
Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Doct. Regeneration is a Resurrection from the Dead. St Paul clearly so
expresseth it <hi>Eph. 5. v. 14. wherefore,</hi> he saith, <hi>Awake thou, that sleepest, and
arise from the Dead, and Christ shall give thee Light.</hi> Behold three things
here. 1. A Sleep. 2. The Awakening from this Sleep. 3. The cause of Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>1. Here is a sleep; <hi>Thou that sleepest.</hi> Every man in his Natural state is a
divine Spirit, an Immortal Soul, an Image of God, a Son of God in a deep
Sleep. The Natural Sleep is defined to be a perfect ligation, or binding up
of all the senses outward, or inward. But this is an unnatural Sleep, into
which we are cast by the Enchantments, and Power of the Devil. It is the
Sleep of Sin. O man, all thy senses and faculties, outward and inward,
which were true, pure, and divine, in the Similitude of God, whilst they were
awake, and at liberty, were continually feasted with divine Objects, they
possessed, and enjoyed a Paradise in themselves. But how are they now fallen
asleep, how are they bound up? Thou now no more seest, hearest, tastest,
feelest, understandest, enjoyest any sweet beam of truth, any thing of the
Harmonious Musick, of the delicate Relish, of the soft Embraces, of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable,
all-satisfying Reality, and Substance of pure Love, pure Light, pure
Beauty, pure Joy, pure Goodness, Every thing pleasant every thing Real,
every thing Divine is to thee, as if it were not at all: Yet is not thy sleep
quiet. All this, which thou seemest to thy self, to hear, to see, to understand,
to converse with by any of thy senses, or faculties, is a Dream in thy sleep, a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>delusive, a defiling, a melancholy Dream, where false, and filthy showes
of Pleasures are mingled with tumultuous disquiets, confusions, torments
fears, and Horrours.</p>
               <p>This Sleep is the Sleep of Death, not a Natural, and momentany Death,
which is a meer cessation of Life with a rest from all its troubles, but a living
Death, the second Death, a Hellish Death, the Death of damned Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rits. Thus
are Sleep and Death joyned here; <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, and stand up from
the Dead.</hi> This Sleep is a true Death, and this Death is truely a Sleep, a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Death, or an unquiet Sleep full of evil Dreams.</p>
               <p>2. The second thing is the Awakening. The Awakening out of this Sleep
is also a Resurrection from the Dead. <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, and stand up
from the Dead.</hi> This is the Regeneration, or new Birth, by which the soul
is raised up from the Sleep, and Death of Sin into the Light of Life, and
Immortality.</p>
               <p>3. The third thing is the cause of this Awakening; <hi>And Christ shall give
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:49838:264"/>
thee Light. And,</hi> here signifies, as much as, For, by a common Hebraism.
Thus you are to read it, Awake thou that sleepest, and stand up from the
Dead, for Christ shall give thee Light. This will be plain, if you look to that
Scripture, from which this is taken <hi>Isaia. 60. 1. v. Arise, sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne; for thy Light
is come, and the Glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> applies this to
the Lord Jesus, and a Sinner in the work of Conversion, or Regeneration,
Poor Sinner, thou sleepest in a dark and miry Dungeon, of Sensuality, Lust,
Passion, Ignorance, Unbelief, Despair, like <hi>Peter</hi> sleeping in Prison, bound
with two Souldiers on each side him: so thou sleepest in the dark Prison of
the flesh, and this World, in the midst of Devils, with whom thou art chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and bound. Thou liest dead in this dead Image of things, as in a Grave
of Corruption, and Rottenness. Behold the Lord Jesus full of the Beauties
of Holiness, full of the unsearchable Riches of Divine Love shineth upon thee
with a Light of Glory. He, who is the Light and Glory of God, of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
of Eternity, as he shineth upon thee, giveth thee Light, infuseth this
Light of Glory into thee, by giving himself to thee, by infusing himself into
thee, by springing up himself within thee, as he shineth from without upon
thee. Thus he awakens thee. Thus awakened, stand up from the Dead. For
Christ giveth thee Light.</p>
               <p>The work of Regeneration, which is a true Resurrection from Death to
Life, will be more clearly understood by considering it in these four Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
1. The Life, which is raised again; 2. The Death, out of which this
Life is raised; 3. The Resurrection itself; 4. The way of this Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>1. The life which is raised again is twofold; 1. One Life is that of Paradise
at the beginning of Time. We had an earthly head in Paradise, in whom
we all stood, and subsisted together in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> or of Divine Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
There we were clothed with a Divine Image, and enjoyed a Divine
Life. We were made in the similitude of God, and lived a life like to that
of God himself. St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of this Life, <hi>Rom. 7. 9. v. For I was alive
without the Law once.</hi> I know that this Scripture, is generally applied to the
convincing, and the condemning Power of the Law. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
here to speak of that Life of Pleasure, and satisfaction to his own decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
mind, and senses, which he enjoyed in sin before he felt the work of
the Law upon his Heart convincing him of the Evil of Sin. But whoever
well considers this Scripture will very plainly see, that it cannot bear this
sense. For 1. The scope of this place is to shew that which is expressed at
the 5th. Verse, <hi>That the Motions of Sin are by the Law</hi> which work in our
Members to bring forth fruit unto Death. 2. The objection which is made
at the 7th. verse, <hi>what shall we say then, is the Law sin?</hi> can have no ground
in any other sense than this, that Sin itself takes life from the Law. 3. St.
<hi>Paul</hi> expresly proceeds in his reasoning by these steps verse 8th, 9th. <hi>Sin tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:49838:264"/>
occasion by the Commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.</hi>
He proves that by this Argument; <hi>for without the Law sin was dead.</hi> The
force of the connection makes it clear, that the death of sin here meant, is not
the death in Sin with stupidity and security, but a Life free from the power
and pollution of Sin. This is explained and illustrated by another Argument;
<hi>For I was alive without the Law once.</hi> While all things stood in the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and unity of the Divine Image undivided, the Light, and the Darkness
no where appearing as two, but as one in one Divine Spirit, in one Divine
Harmony. There was nothing from which sin could take life. Now St. <hi>Paul</hi>
lived, now as he, so we lived, and all Mankind, according to our several pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
and distinct Persons in Paradise, together with <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; in <hi>Adam,</hi> who
was the Earthly Head, and collective Body of us all, like Christ in Heaven.</p>
               <p>2. The other Life, which is raised again in the Regeneration, is the Life of
Heaven in Eternity. Before, and above our Earthly Head, we had a Head
in Heaven, in Eternity, the Lord Jesus, in whose Image and Similitude <hi>Adam</hi>
was Created to be a Figure of him. In this heavenly and eternal Head had
we a Heavenly and Eternal Life. Our Heavenly Life in Eternity is as the
Light. Our Earthly Life in Paradise as the Shadow to this Light. O thou,
who art now as a Dunghil covered with, and composed of the most loathsom
pollutions and defilements of Sin, who art withered in all thy Beauties, Hopes
and Comforts; who art sunk deepest into despair; who art now no more a
Man, but a Worm, the worst of Worms, the seed of the Serpent; See from
whence thou art fallen, what once thou wert; what Lives, what Joys, what
Glories lie buried in thee? Thou wert once a beautiful Prince, like the
Morning Star: Thou wert once the Perfection of Beauty, and Pleasantness
in the Figure, in Paradise, in <hi>Adam:</hi> Thou wert once the Perfection of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Life itself, in Heaven, in Eternity, in the Lord Jesus. Whither are
these Beauties now fled? How do these Beautiful Lives now lie as in the
Grave covered with the Darkness of Death? The Psalmist saith to the Lord,
<hi>That the Saints pity the Dust of Sion, and take Pleasure in the Stones thereof.</hi>
O all you, who hear, and read this; In your selves, in each other see, pity,
take Pleasure in the Ruins of the Divine Life, of the Divine Image, of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
of Heaven with all their Beauties, Joys, and Glories. See the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
from Heaven looking upon them with an eye of pity, and delight. Let
this be a Beam of hope to you shining from his face into the midst of the
Darkness of your Guilt, Defilements, and despair that by him these beautiful,
and blessed Lives may rise again.</p>
               <p>2. The Death out of which this Life is raised, is that of Sin, and of the
Curse for Sin. <hi>Eph. 2. 1. v.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, we were dead in Sin. Hear, and
read this, O man, with sighs, and tears, with trembling, and terrour. Thy
Life it self is now a Death, and a cursed Death such a Death, as makes the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between an Angel in Glory, and a Devil in Hell. The corruption of
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:49838:265"/>
the best things is worst. The fall of the highest and greatest things makes the
greatest, and most dreadful Ruine. The Divine Life is dead; the Divine Image
is fallen in thee. Thou art dead in Sin. Sin lived, and I died, saith St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in the forementioned place. A Life of Darkness, shame, Disorder, deformity,
enmity, the Life and Image of Hell, and Devils are sprung up in thee, and are
become a Grave of hate and horrour which hath swallowed up the Life, the
Image of Love, Beauty, and Joy, of Heaven, of Angels, of God into a cursed
Victory in thee. All the stings and terrours of the first death in the separation
of the Soul, and Body, are all the secret burnings of this Hellish fire of the
Death in Sin now quite consuming the broken Relicks of the Divine Light,
and sweetness in the Flesh, and enlarging itself into the second Death, as into
an eternal Flame of Wrath, and torment.</p>
               <p>Look up, oh man! see this whole World of these Heavens, and this Earth,
as a Charnel-house, or a dark Vault for the Dead. See thy self in this Body,
as a melancholy Coffin in the midst of this Vault, where thine own Divine
Life and Image, with ten thousand blessed Lives, the Life of Christ, of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
of Heaven, lie dead and buried. See this place in which now thou
art, the smoaky porch, and gloomy entrance into Hell, like a cloudy Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that dismal Night. See thy self walking here as a wretched Ghost
and Shade in the midst of the Dead, in the midst of cursed Apparitions from
below, and thy self together with all these, ready every moment to vanish
into everlasting Darkness, and Flames. This is the Death, out of which
the Divine Life is raised in the first Resurrection or the Regeneration.</p>
               <p>3. The Resurrection of this Life, out of this Death, is to be declared in its
first step, which is the Regeneration, or New-birth. The Divine Nature, which
lies hid at the bottom, and in the center of the Soul, lives there to itself with
its Heavenly, and Earthly Image, as in the Secret of its own twofold Paradise,
whereof one was never yet revealed in any Creature until Christ; the other
with drew itself hither from the sight of the Soul at the Fall. This Divine
Nature, as to the Soul itself, whose Root it is, of whose Being it is the only
Life, and Truth, lies slain by the Life of Sin, and buried in its own Ruines
beneath the Darkness, and Confusion of the Corrupt, the Fleshly, and the
Hellish Image.</p>
               <p>This Divine Nature in the moment of Regeneration, or Conversion is
new-born in the Soul, or, which is the same, the Soul is new-born into the
Divine Nature, and comes forth with a new, and Divine Being, into a new,
and Divine World.</p>
               <p>This change is called a Birth, because the Divine Nature, as the Seed of
God sown in the Soul, diffuseth itself thorough the Soul, changeth the Soul
into one Nature, and Life with itself, so bringeth forth itself in the soul, and
the Soul together with itself, in its own Divine Life, and Likeness.</p>
               <p>The Eternal Spirit is the Father of this Birth, which sendeth forth this holy
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:49838:265"/>
Seed. This Spirit is also the Mother. For in the naked Bosom of the Eternal
Spirit, at once the Seed of God is sown in the soul, and the Soul is sown, as a
new Seed sent forth immediately from God, wrapt up in the Seed of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Spirit also itself is this Seed. For so the Lord Jesus saith, <hi>John 3. That
which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This New birth is said to be from above; because it is immediately from
God; the Birth of God, as he is in the Simplicity of his Godhead uncloathed
of every Vail, infinitely transcending all created powers, and perfections. This
Birth is expressed by being born again, as a second Birth. For man was first
born unto a Divine Light, and Image in P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>radise, where he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>so dyed to this
Life, and Image, unto which he is now born a second time, That was a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
onely: This the Shadow, and the Substance both in Union.</p>
               <p>This Birth is also called a Resurrection, and is truely so upon this account.
That same Divine Person, in his own proper, and individual Existency, which
died in Paradise, which ever since hath lien slain, and buried in the corrupt,
sinful Person sprung up in its place, as in a Grave, now riseth again. As it ris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
it casteth off this cursed, and Hellish person as a Body rising to Glory
casteth off the form of a dead Carcass, of Rottenness, and dust, recovering,
its own proper place, and right.</p>
               <p>But there is a threefold difference, between this Divine Nature in its first
Life in Paradise, and its first Resurrection in its Regeneration, or New-birth.</p>
               <p>1. In Paradise the Divine Nature sprung up, and appeared in a Earthy Image
and in an Earthy Person, only as in a lovely shadow of itself. The Heavenly
Person, the Heavenly Image, although it were the Root, the Truth, the Life,
the Fulness of this Shadow, yet it lay concealed beneath it, as a Vail, or as
the Fruit lies hid in the Blossom. By Sin the Blossom falls to make way for
this Fruit. In the new birth, out of the Ruins of the Earthy Person, and the
Earthy Image, as the rending of the Vail, the Divine Nature springs up, and
shines forth in its own Heavenly Person, and Image. Thus that which was
sown by the Fall a Heavenly and Divine Shadow riseth again by the new
birth a Heavenly, and Divine Substance, which is the Shadow in its Life, and
Truth.</p>
               <p>The Holy Scriptures declare this Glorious Mystery; 1 Epist. <hi>John 5. c.</hi>
where we read, <hi>That there are three which bear record in Heaven, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Word, and the Spirit,</hi> A little after we read, <hi>That he, who believeth
hath the record in himself.</hi> If a Believer hath the Record within himself, he
hath also within himself those who bear the Record. For a Record, or Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
hath all its authority, and force from the Persons of the Witnesses, as it
is given by them, and cometh forth out of their mouths. Behold then here
in the moment of believing, God himself in the three Persons in their Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Image, which is the Heaven of Heavens, bringing forth the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as their own proper Birth, and Child in an Heavenly Person, and in
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:49838:266"/>
their own Heavenly Image, in which they themselves dwell together with
him, giving their Testimony to him, in which he believes.</p>
               <p>2. That which was the Beauty, and the beautiful Inhabitant of Paradise,
was the Divine Nature in the Earthly Image, and in an Earthy Person, which
stood singly in a shadowy Joy, and Glory. The Heavenly Person, and the
Heavenly Image, which were the Life itself were hidden, and Vailed beneath
this Shadow; like the Glory of a Flower in its seed beneath the Earth, when
the Plant begins first to appear; or like the ripe fruit hid in the Blossom.</p>
               <p>In the New birth that Divine Person, and Form, which died in the Shadow,
riseth again in the blessed life, and most beautiful Truth of the Eternal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
As the Accorn, which was first an Oak, being sown in the Ground, and
dying, springs up again into a fair, and flourishing tree. But there is this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
the Accorn is not the same Oak which at first it was, but only ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the same kind. But here the Shadow in its new birth riseth again in
that Individual Person, and proper Essence of Glory, out of which it first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended.
As Jesus Christ saith, <hi>I came forth from God into the world; again, I
leave the world, and go to the Father.</hi> So Saith this new-born Child of God, I
was before the World, with my Elder Brother in the bosom of the Father, I
was with the Father in the bosom of my Elder Brother, one Spirit, one Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Image, one Brightness of Glory together with him. I came forth from
this Glory into a Shadowy similitude of it, into an Earthly Paradise. From
thence I fell by sin into that Death which is my Life in this present evil
World. Again through the Death of Christ by the Resurrection of the new
Birth I leave both this living Death in the World, &amp; that Shadowy Life of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
&amp; return to my first Glory with Jesus Christ in the bosom of the Father.</p>
               <p>Moreover that Earthly Image, and shadowy Paradise are not lost. These
also rise again in their Regeneration. They arise again the same Individuals,
but in a far different Form, and in a far differing manner of subsisting. The
Earthly man of the first Paradise is born anew, subsisting in the Person of the
Heavenly Man, as the Humanity of Christ subsisted in his Divine, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Person. The Earthy Man springs up in the bosom of the Heavenly Man.
It is no more now, as at the first, a vail on the Sun-like Face and Spiritual
Beauties of the Heavenly Pattern, and Original. But it is to it, as the fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>shest
Beams, and the most Flowry Light of the Sunshine is to the Sun. It Flows im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from the naaked Form, and fulness of the Heavenly Glory, it, is
transparent to it, filled and covered with it. The Earthly Paradise now flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth
in the midst of the Heavenly Paradise, which shineth all through it,
bringing it forth, as one Person, and one Spirit with itself.</p>
               <p>This is the new Heaven, and the new Earth, the Heavenly Man, and the
Heavenly Paradise newly, and nakedly discovered, so as it never before was
in this Creation; The earthly man also, and the earthly Paradise, brought
forth into a new state, and Glory by their Union, and fellowship with the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:49838:266"/>
Heavenly Man, and the Heavenly Paradise, as a Bride adorned by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of her Bridegroom coming forth like the Sun. Thus Jesus Christ makes
all things new in the new Creature; and brings forth the new Creature toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with himself in himself, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks 2 <hi>Corin. c. 5. v. If any man be
in Christ he is a new Creature,</hi> or a new Creation. For behold, saith Christ, I
make all things new.</p>
               <p>This new birth, and Resurrection of the Heavenly, and earthly Glories
united in one Person in a Saint is excellently represented in that forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
place of St. <hi>John. 1. Epist. c. 5. v.</hi> Having said, <hi>There are three that
bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit;</hi> he adds, <hi>There
are three that bear record on Earth;</hi> and saith he, <hi>these three agree in one.</hi> The
first three were one Heavenly Spirit, and Image. The last three agree in
one Earthly Image with themselves, and in one Heavenly Spirit with the
Heavenly Image and the Heavenly three. A Believer, as is before noted, is
said to have the Record, or Testimony of these Witnesses in himself. He hath
then also the Witnesses in himself; for these Witnesses testifying of themselves
to the Soul are in their own unvailed persons, and Divine presence, the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
the Truth of the Testimony, the Authority, the Witnesses all in one.</p>
               <p>The second Trinity of Witnesses is 1. the Water. 2. The Blood. 3. The
Spirit.</p>
               <p>1. The Water is the natural or Earthly Image washt as by a Baptism of
Water from its filth, like a piece of Gold fallen into the dirt. The first Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
is exprest by Water. It was a pure, and clear Sea of finest Christal.
The Face of God shining forth upon this Sea of Chrystal at once filled it
with the sweet Light of his Beams, and figured his Beauties upon it, which
Light and Figure, were the Light of Paradise, and the Life of the first man in
it. Sin by a mixture of Earth with this pure Water pollut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th it, troubleth it,
changeth the Light into Darkness, and the Beautiful Figure of the Divine
Glory into Confusion. The clear, and sweet calm is now changed into a black
and foul Tempest. The new birth separating the dark, &amp; d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>filing Earth from
the clear, &amp; pure Flood, gives a Resurrection to the Divine Light, the Divine
Form, the Earthly man in its puriti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>, and the first Paradise in its Beauties.</p>
               <p>2. The Blood is the second Witness joyned together with the Water.
This is the Earthly Image heightened with a more excellent washing than
that of Water, which is this of the precious Blood of God himself. This
Blood taketh away by the vertue of Christs Death the darkness of the vail,
which interposeth between the naked Glories of the Heavenly Image, and the
Earthly Image, keeping it in the state of a shadow only. Now this most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Blood as a rich Flood of Divine Light, and Life breaks in freely, and
fully upon the Earthly Image in its new birth, that it is no more the shadow
to that Heavenly substance, but the face in the Glass answering to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
face of the supream, and Eternal Beauty. Thus the Earthly Man and
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:49838:267"/>
the Earthly Paradise returneth, and riseth again in the Regeneration not by
Water only, but by Blood, not as the shadowy Similitude of a concealed
Beauty, but the shining brightness of a present, and unclouded Glory. This
is the second Witness on Earth. The Spirit is the last of the three Witnesses
in the Earthly Image. This giveth his Testimony joyntly in both Images,
the Heavenly and the Earthly. This Spirit is the same in both; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which bringeth both forth from its own Eternal Womb; the Life,
which dwells in both; the Glory, which fits, and cloaths them both; the
Love which Eternally sports in both, which fills both with purest, &amp; perpetual
Pleasures in themselves, &amp; in each other. This Spirit is that band of perfection,
which by its Heavenly, &amp; entire Unity maks the heavenly &amp; the earthly Image
both one Spirit, one Life, one Glory, one Divine Person, one new man in Christ
Jesus, in whose bosom they lie, mutually infolding each other in most beautiful,
and most delightful Embraces. Thus now is the Earthly man, and the Earthly
Paradise risen again in the Regeneration, not single, but as a glorious Bride to
the Heavenly Image, &amp; the Heavenly Paradise, having her Bridegroom in her
arms, and being clasped fast in his. This is the second difference between the
Soul in its Earthly Paradise, and in the first Resurrection, when it is new born
to a life of Grace in the place of that Life of pure nature.</p>
               <p>3. You have seen two differences between the Life in the state of pure
nature in Paradise, and the Resurrection of this Life unto a state of Grace in
the Regeneration, or new birth. In these two differences this Life, as it is
risen again excelleth itself, as it was in its pure, and primitive state for the
kind, and nature of it, after a wonderful manner, by an accession of the most
Heavenly, and highest Glory together with Immortality.</p>
               <p>But this third difference will shew us this Life in the Resurrection as it is a
Life of Grace for its present state and degrees on Earth far inferiour unto it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as it was pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ely natural in the first Paradise.</p>
               <p>1. The Life of Grace in the Regeneration, or Resurrection is imperfect
in degree, while it is on Earth, it is in its Infancy, in its Childhood, under age,
under Guardians, under the Tutorship of Angels, as St. Paul speaks. It is
a Life of Faith, not of clear, and compleat Fruition. It is a dying Life, a Life
bearing the Image of Christ's Death, and not yet brought forth entirely into
the Resurrection from the Dead. It is a Life subject to many weaknesses by
reason of its Infant-state, and Childhood. It is a Life in Growth, and so
not arrived to its perfect Stature.</p>
               <p>2. The Life of Grace in this first Resurrection is imperfect for its state.
The Spiritual or Heavenly Man in a Believer is joyned in the same Person
with the Old Man, which is cursed, and corrupt with the Child of the Curse,
and Corruption. The Heavenly Image, and the Earthly Image new-born,
Heaven itself, and the first Paradise risen again, are truly in a Saint on Earth,
do compose the true Nature, Essence, and Person of a Saint. But there are
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:49838:267"/>
joyned together with these in the same outward Person the Earthly Image, as
it is corrupt, and the Hellish Image, the Earthly or fleshly Image, as it is
fallen, and the Hellish Image, in which inseparably do reside the universal
Corruption, and Curse, all the powers of Darkness, Death and Hell. Thus
are all the Purities, Sweetnesses, Glories of Paradise or Heaven in a Saint
mixed, and Vailed, that they can never appear intire or in their own proper
Form, but imperfectly, darkly, and Enigmatically, as St <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, or, as
those men, that were seen walking in the forms of Trees, by him, whose
eyes Jesus Christ had touched the first time only. Thus the Spiritual Man
in a Saint, though it have Heaven, and Paradise united in itself, yet in this
first step of its resurrection, it hath within the same outward person a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
interchangeable War, and Fight with the Earth, and with Hell, the
Flesh, and the Devil. Sometimes it is made a Captive cast into Chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
laid low with all its Glories in a deep, and miery dungeon, where no
spark of Divine Light appears; when it is a Conquerour it is in the field still
where its sweetness, and Glory are vailed, and stained, as with the dust of the
Earth, as with the smoke of the Fight and of Hell, as with the Blood of its
Wounds. In the midst of these it is ever alarmed to new Fights. This
is the state of a Saint in the first step of the Resurrection, which is the new
Birth or the Life of Grace on Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection.</hi> Some that are truly Saints, may now say to us, Alas how are
we excluded from the new birth, if they, who are new born, have Heaven,
and Paradise in an Heavenly Form brought forth within them, and they
themselves, are after an Heavenly manner brought forth into these, as by a
Resurrection from the dead? How far are we from discerning any thing so
sweet, so great, so Glorious in our selves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I shall give five answers to this Objection to comfort the lowest of
the Saints, who least of all seem to themselves to be such.</p>
               <p>1. The Lord Jesus lay in the Womb, was laid an Infant in the Manger,
slept as a man, had all the Light of Heaven, Visible, or invisible withdrawn
from him, being deserted by the God-head itself in respect to any sensible
presence, assistance, or enjoyment of it, died on the Cross, was shut up a dead
Corps in the Grave. Yet in the Womb, in the Manger, in his sleep, in his
Desertion, on the Cross, in the Grave, had he Heaven, and Paradise with their
divinest sweetnesses, and fulnesses in himself, he himself was after the sweetest,
fullest, and Divinest manner in Paradise, and Heaven. For he himself in
his own Person is the Light, the Life, and Truth of both. All this was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably
true of him even in his Flesh, and in his natural man, when to
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:49838:268"/>
him in his Flesh, and in his natural man nothing of this appeared, or seemed
to be at all. Thus may it be with thee, O doubting, and mourning Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
who weepest for that life of the Spirit, which hath Heaven, and Paradise
in it by having Jesus Christ risen from the dead in it. Thou refusest to be
comforted, because these are not, or rather appear not in thee. But consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this, and be comforted. Cast thy eye upon thy Pattern the Lord Jesus,
and then say; Christ with Heaven and Paradise may be in me. I may be
in Heaven, and in Paradise by being in Christ, though this appear not to
me. Christ may be in me, I may be in Christ in the Womb, or in the
Manger, in a deep sleep, or a desertion upon the Cross, or in the Grave.
But in Truth by all these, Heaven and Paradise with all their Divine store,
and furniture, rise up in me so much the more Gloriously, by how much the
more Christ is formed in me, and I am conformed to Christ.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Ans.</hi> Jesus Christ in the Gospel compareth the Kingdom of Heaven, or of God,
to a seed of wheat sown in the field, which cometh up first in the Blade, then in
the Stalk, then in the Ear, and lastly in the Ripe Corn in the Ear. Why dost
thou sigh, O Believer, and say, that thou hast nothing of Christ, of Heaven,
of Paradise risen from the dead, and new-born in thee, because they shine not
forth in thee, and they take not thee in to see them, to be seen by them, to
converse with them in their Spiritual, proper, eternal Forms, and Glories?
It may be true, that they may not yet be sprung up in thee like the ripe corn
in the ear in the Ripeness, and maturity of their own Spirituality, and of the
Heavenly Image. Yet may they flourish in the Ear, that is, in a high and
sweet Figure of Spirituality according to the purest letter of the Gospel,
which may have the Spirit itself for a hidden life in it, and ready to reveal it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as the perfect Fruit. But suppose thou hast not attained to this, yet sing
for Joy; the Spring and the Summer Season are come; Harvest is not far off;
if the Kingdom of God, which is Christ, Heaven, Paradise all in one, and all
in a Heavenly Glory be come up in thee into a Green and Living stalk.
Perhaps thou art yet subject to the Ministry of the Law. Rejoyce in this, if it
Spring from the Seed of Promise, if it flourish by the Virtue, and Life of
this Seed forming itself into this stalk, although it lie vailed there. This li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Stalk, this living Ministry of the Law, hath not only an outward Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and Lustre upon it, but the inward Glory of the Spiritual Kingdom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it, which sends forth this outward Life, and Lustre, which will itself also
in its proper season sprout forth from it.</p>
               <p>Dost thou fall short of this also, dost thou see nothing in thy self of Letter
or Spirit, of Law or Gospel, in any clearness of Life, or Power, by which
thou canst make any comfortable Judgment of thy self; Are not these mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of thine, that sence, those impressions, those desires, affections, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:49838:268"/>
the causes and companions of these mournings, which come up so thick
in the ground of thy Spirit by day, and by night; are not these that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, that Jesus with Heaven, and Paradise in the midst of thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thine eyes, as in the Blade, or the Herb, which can hardly be discerned, or
distinguished from common grass, by common eyes? In the mean time thou
like <hi>Mary</hi> complainest, that Christ is taken away from thee, when he standeth
before thee risen from the dead, and talketh with thee though vailed under
the form of a Gardener.</p>
               <p>But let it be that no green things appears in the field of thy Soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is naked,
cold, and hard, like the Earth in Winter. Yet mourn not as one without
hope. This naked ground may be a flourishing field of Corn in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
time. This naked and hard heart of thine may in its proper Season sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and flourish into an Heavenly Paradise by the springing up of Christ in it.
For even now in this disconsolate &amp; desolate state, may God the Father, and the
Holy Angels from on high have their eye with Love, and delight upon it
from one end of the year to the other, as seeing Heaven and Paradise with all
their own Joys and Excellencies treasured up there in their seed, which is
Christ, sown in thee.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Heavenly Image in thee, who art born again, while thou
livest on Earth, is subject to various Clouds, and Storms. It is always in a
conjunction with the fleshly Image and the Spirit of the Devil. These never
suffer it to shine forth clearly, and purely. These often so cloud it, and
captlvate it, that it can send forth no one sweet beam or spark to enlighten
thee to any sensible discovery of it, or warm thee with any sensible comfort
in it. The Law of God, which is the Law of the Spirit of Life, in which
Spirit the Heaven, and Paradise of a Saint are seated, is within in the inward
man, in the mind. But the Law of Sin, which is the Spirit of this World,
where Death, Hell and the Devil, have their place, and their Thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, is still
manifest and Powerful in thy Members, in thy outward man. What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then, if thine inward Man, like the Face of Heaven, and of an Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Paradise with the Lord Jesus in his Spiritual Glory shining in them, as
the Sun in its purity and strength, be discerned by thee very weakly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly,
when they are to be seen thorough so thick, so polluted, so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
an Air of the natural Spirit in thy Members? Nay what wonder is it,
if from the Morning of thy Life to the Evening of it, such blackness of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
cover the whole Face, of these beautiful, and Heavenly things in thee,
that they appear not at all to thee, although they constantly shine in the same
Glory, and move in the same order in themselves, to themselves within thee;
when as such Powers of Darkness have their seat in thine outward Man,
thorough which they are to appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="508" facs="tcp:49838:269"/>
4. <hi>Ans.</hi> Thou perhaps, O afflicted Soul, with the eye of Sense, and of
Reason, by the Light of thine own Spirit, lookest to see the Kingdom of God
with its Joys, and Glories, and Glorious Inhabitants in thee. But these are
Spiritual things, and to be discerned Spiritually. They are Spiritual Senses,
which alone can take in the Divine sweetnesses, and Beauties of this Spiritual
Paradise, and Heaven. It is the Light of the Spirit alone, in which they
shine forth and appear. It is the Breath of the Spirit alone, which makes
their Spices to flow forth, and give their smells. Thou O dejected Soul!
mayest have thy Spiritual senses yet weak: Like a new-born Child thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
behold, and gaze upon the Light of the Heavenly Sun, and yet not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
what that is, which thou seest, or that thou seest any thing at all. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the Spirit is free, he breaths, and gives his Light, where he pleaseth,
when he pleaseth, and in what degree he pleaseth. The Garden of God
may be in thee, thou mayest be in the midst of this Garden, and yet not aware
of it, because it is either a dark Season, where nothing appears, or a twilight
of the Spirit only, where the Flowers, and Plants of this Garden appear, like
little Clouds, or dark spots undistinguished.</p>
               <p>5 <hi>Ans.</hi> There are three ways, by which the new Birth or the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the dead evidenceth itself to the Soul. 1. The Seal of the Spirit.
2. The Witness of the Spirit. 3. A Spiritual Instinct.</p>
               <p>1. The Seal of the Spirit is the clearest, and compleatest evidence. Of
this you read <hi>Eph. 1. v 13. You are sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise.</hi>
The Spirit himself, in his own person was the Promise, and is the Seal. St.
<hi>John 14. v.</hi> 20. Jesus Christ in that Chapter promiseth the Spirit, which
he would send down, when he was ascended, to be in them. He calleth this
Spirit the Spirit of Truth, and the Comforter. Together with the promise
of the Spirit he promiseth them, that he would come again to them, and that
they should see him, and have Joy, and that none should take this Joy from
them; because they should never more lose the sight of him. He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
likewise that at that day of the Spirit his Father, and himself would
come together, and sup with them, and lodge with them. The rich, and
glorious ground of all this sweet mystery of the Divine Love, and Fellowship
between the Father, and Christ, and the Spirit, and the Saints in the Spirit,
at the coming of the Spirit is this: 1. The blessed Person of the Holy Spirit
in the Trinity is the beautiful band of that sweet, and sacred Union, in which
the two other Persons the Father, and the Son most nakedly, most entirely
at the utmost heighth of their Beauties, and Loves, possess and enjoy each
other. The same Person of the Spirit in the mystical, and Marriage Union
between Christ, and the Soul, is that sweet, and sacred Unity, by the Virtue
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:49838:269"/>
of which the Father, Christ, and a Saint in the Purity, and Perfection
of all Heavenly sweetnesses, and excellencies behold, love, and take Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in each other, as one Spirit. By this you may see how the Spirit is
the Promise, and the Seal and what this Seal of the Spirit means.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jesus fully expresseth it in the verse mentioned: <hi>At that
day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi>
This day is the day of the Spirit, the day of the Spirits coming into the
Soul, and appearing there. In the Revelation of this third Person the
Holy Spirit, when he shines forth in the Spirit of a Saint; the Father,
Christ, and a Saint are all seen together in one Glory, the Glory of the
Father; in the Fellowship, and Unity of this Spirit, which is the Spirit
of Glory. This Union, and this Vision takes the Saint up into itself,
fixeth itself in a Saint, displayeth itself there by the immediate Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Glory of that Heavenly Person, the Spirit himself which is
the Spirit of Truth. This is the Seal of the Spirit; this is the Banner of
Love. Thus he sets himself as a Seal upon the Heart of his spouse,
thus he spreads himself, as a Banner of Love over her head in his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting-house.
How clearly in this Day, in this Vision, and Unity of
the Spirit doth the Beloved Spouse of Christ see Heaven and Paradise, ten
thousand Heavens and Paradises, new-born, and risen within herself;
herself new-born, and risen into the midst of them, and enjoying them
all?</p>
               <p>Dost thou mourn, O dejected Soul, that thou hast not received this
Seal of the Spirit? Alas! how few have? How hath this Seal been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
since the Nations of the World received the mark of Anti-Christ?
Mourn thou together with all the Saints, for the absence of
the Heavenly Bridegroom in this Vision of his Glory, and Seal of his
Love. But mourn not as without Hope. Press forward to this Day
of the Spirit, and to the Brightness of the rising of the Lord Jes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s together
with the Father upon thy Soul in the Person of the Spirit, which is the
Union of all Loves, Joys, and Glories, as all Lights are United in the
Sun. This Day hath already dawned, some few have seen the dawnings
of it, and rejoyced to see it, when it hath shone forth upon the tops of
their Spirits, as the Sun in the pleasant morning of a Summers-day gilds
the Tops of the Mountains.</p>
               <p>2. The Second Evidence is the Witness of the Spirit. Of this <hi>Paul</hi>
speaketh <hi>Rom. 8. v. 16. The Spirit itself beareth Witness in our Spirit,
that we are the Children of God.</hi> This Witness of the Spirit may be
more interrupted, and be accompanied in the Soul with less Glory, and
a less triumphant Joy; yet is it clear, and sweet, and sure; although the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:49838:270"/>
clearness, and the sweetness have their different degrees. The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Spirit is as tho Voice of God in the Soul received, and ecchoed
to by the Soul. The Seal of the Spirit is the Glorious Face of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in the Soul, and by the kiss of its mouth Uniting it to the Soul,
so that it stamps its own Heavenly Image upon the Soul, and Ravishing
the Soul into one Life, and Form of Glory with itself becomes its own
Reflection there, equally embracing, and embraced, enjoying, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
in the Unity of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Thou, who feest not the Seal of the Spirit upon thy heart, open thy
Spiritual Ear, hearken unto the voice of the Spirit, hearken to the voice
of thine own Spirit. These two by a sweet Consent, and Harmony may
testifie together the Love of God in thee. Their voice may be low,
and not to be heard in the Tumult, and noise of thy Fears, and Doubts.
In the calmness, quietness, and rest of a meek, and resigned Spirit, hearken
diligently, and thou mayest hear this low voice. Though this voice be
low, yet is it clear and sweet. The Love, and Peace, and Joy of the
Spirit, the Spirit of Love, Peace, and Joy himself are in this low voice.</p>
               <p>3. The third Evidence is the Instinct of the Spirit, which seems to
be mentioned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as a less degree of Evidence going before that
of the Witness of the Spirit. <hi>Rom. 8. 15. Ye have received the Spirit
of Adoption whereby ye Cry Abba Father.</hi> The little Lamb newly yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and come forth from the Dam in a great flock amongst many Lambs,
and Ews knoweth its own Dam, discerneth its call from all others, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to it, keepeth by its side, when it is in any fear, seeketh and sucketh
its Milk, and the nourishment of its Life from it. This is the Instinct of
Nature, which faileth not the Births of Nature. Thus every Child of
God hath much more a Spiritual, and Divine Instinct, which is insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from the Divine Nature in it. The Spirit of God in it, when the Light
of the Divine Nature is most obscured, is a Spirit of Son-ship, or Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in the Soul by secret Impressions leading it, inclining, and carrying
it to God, as its Father, giving it a secret sense, and discerning of the
Voice of God, and of its Relation to God, as by the instinct of the Divine
Nature. Consider this, ye doubting, fearful, and distressed Saints; consider
this, and be comforted. Thou hast no clear sight of the Face of God.
Thou hast no clear Testimony of the Love of God in thy Spirit. Thou
hast no distinct understanding of thy Union with God, or of the Nature
of God, or of the things of God. Thou hast no Evidences, by which
thou canst satisfy thy own Reason, thorow any discourse of Reason. But
thou art inwardly carryed in thy desires, and inclinations to God, to
please him, to be with him. Thy Soul secretly hangs upon God, and
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:49838:270"/>
cleaveth to him. Thou inwardly longest, and thirstest to suck in from his
Breasts the milk of Spiritual Life, Comfort, and Light. In the day of
thy fears, and distress thine Eye looketh to God, thine Heart cryeth, and
hasteth to him. The call, the voice of God in his Providences, his
Word, and the inward motions of his Spirit touch thine Heart, and turn
thy Bowels within thee. How often in the greatest doubts, and
distresses of thy Spirit dost thou sigh forth to God the name of Father?
Behold this is the instinct of the Divine Nature in thee. This is the
Spirit of Adoption, by which thou art acted, and by which thou cryest
<hi>Abba</hi> Father. Although thou understandest it no more, than the Lamb
understandeth how, or why it is carryed to its Dam, and drawn by its
bleatings. Go thy way then, and be no more troubled, give thy self
up to the instinct, and leadings of this holy Spirit within thee. Thou
shalt certainly see the time, when the obscure smoak of the Spiritual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
in thee will break up into a clear Light, and flame of a Joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable,
and Glorious, both in the Testimony of the Spirit heard within
thee, and the Seal of the Spirit seen upon thee, either in this Life, or in
Eternity.</p>
               <p>We read in the 2 of <hi>Chron.</hi> That <hi>Solomons</hi> Throne had a Foot-stool
of Gold, and six steps up to the Throne. On each side of these steps
were two Lyons, that supported every step. Thou, who hast the Throne
of the Divine Nature in the midst of the Spiritual Paradise, and Heaven
set up within thee in its obscurest, and lowest state, rest in peace, and joy
on the Foot-stool itself, and upon the lowest step of this Throne. For the
Foot-stool itself, the lowest state is of Gold, of an incorruptible, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, which will certainly in its proper time lift thee up to the
full height, and Glory of the Throne itself. The lowest step here, even
at the highest, hath for its support, and guard, two Lyons. The Lord
Jesus, the true Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> in all the Varieties, and
Riches of his Spiritual Glories, multiplies his Presence, and Appearance
round about thee, to sustain, defend, and cherish thee in these first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of Grace in thee, in the midst of thy darkness, and weakness af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the same manner, in the same Heavenly Person of his, in the same ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Love Power, and Glory, as he is with the highest Saints.</p>
               <p>When we began to speak of this first step of the Resurrection, or new
Birth, we propounded four Heads to treat upon. 1. The Life, which
is risen. 2. The Death, out of which it riseth. 3. The Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
itself. 4. The way of this Resurrection. We have finished our
discourse upon three of these. We are now to speak briefly of the last.</p>
               <p>4. The way of the Resurrection in the new birth is Jesus Christ. He
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:49838:271"/>
saith of himself in the Gospel of St. <hi>John, I am the Way.</hi> Jesus Christ
is the way of this Resurrection in six Steps. 1. He is the Price.
2. The Head. 3. The Root. 4. The Pattern. 5. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.
6. The Life of this Resurrection.</p>
               <p>1. The Blood of Christ is the Price of this Resurrection. Jesus
Christ by his Blood hath doubly redeemed us from Death. 1. By Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
giving his Life a Ransom for us to the Divine Justice. 2. By
Conquest having by the effusion of his Blood, and loss of his Life gained
a perfect Victory over all the Powers of Darkness.</p>
               <p>2. The Lord Jesus above in Heaven is the Head of the Resurrection
from the Dead. In the latter part of the first of <hi>Eph.</hi> we have Jesus Christ
gloriously presented unto us in his Resurrection, from the nethermost part
of the Earth, and in his Ascent above all Heavens. Then the Apostle
concludes that discourse and Chapter with this Blessed Consolation, that
God had given him in this Glory of the Resurrection from the Dead to
be the Head over all things to his Church. Thou who mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nest over
thy sins, as the worst of Deaths, who doubtest, who despairest of Life,
raise thy self to a lively Hope. Look up, and see thy self already risen in
his Resurrection, already set down in Heavenly Places together with Christ,
as a Glorious Spirit in that first Spirit, the Head, and Fountain of them
all, from which they are as Inseparable as the Beams in their upper ends
are from the Sun. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks in the former part of the 2d
Chap. of the <hi>Eph.</hi> upon that Divine Ground, which he had laid in the
end of the first Chapter, <hi>That Christ in his Resurrection from the Dead,
is the Head over all to his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The Lord Jesus, as he is risen from the Dead by his Spiritual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in our Hearts, is the root of the Resurrection, or new Birth in us.
1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 15. Jesus Christ, as he is the second <hi>Adam,</hi> is said to be a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Spirit; and the living corner Stone precious, and tryed in his Death,
and precious in his Resurrection, out of which we grow up to be a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to God, that is, both a Spiritual Heaven, and a Spiritual Paradise.
<hi>Eph. 3. He is said to dwell in our Hearts by Faith.</hi> The Lord Jesus is
that Spirit, which is the Root of all Spirits, natural, or supernatural; the
Root of all Life, Natural, and Spiritual; Earthly or Heavenly; Humane,
Angelical, or Divine. Dost thou feel the weight of Death heavy upon
thee? hast thou no sense of any spark of true Life in thee to sweeten ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Death, or Life to thee? Look up to thy Root at the bottom of thy
Spirit, thy Jesus. Abide in this Root, wait for this Root. Here are all
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:49838:271"/>
the Treasures of Spiritual Life laid up. At the set time, in the proper
season this Root shall spring, and bud, and blossom, and bring forth it's
heavenly Fruits replenished with the Light, and sweetness of the Divine
Life and spreading themselves thorow thy whole Soul. Thus shall that
Life of God, which thou hast lost, which in thy death retired itself hither
into its Root, rise again in thee, and thou be new-born into this Life. Thus
shall Jesus Christ, as an Heavenly Root in thy Heart, bring forth himself
unto the Life of Faith, which is his own Heavenly Image in thee within
the Vail, the Cloud of Flesh. Thus doth he make thine heart from this
Root of Eternity to be an Heavenly Habitation, and dwelling place for
himself raised up new, and Eternal out of the Ruines of Death.</p>
               <p>4. Our blessed Saviour is the Pattern of the Resurrection to us. In
the 8th of the <hi>Rom.</hi> we are said to be predestinated to be conformed to his
Image. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. God is spoken of as working Faith, and so bringing forth
the Spiritual Life in us according to that exceeding greatness of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
by which he raised Christ from the Dead. We read in the Gospel,
that a mighty Angel came down from Heaven, and rolled away the Stone
from the mouth of the Grave, while the Watchmen about the Grave
were cast into a deep sleep, to make way for the rising of Christ. How
frequently doth the Soul, which feels the horrour of the Spiritual Death,
think its Resurrection to a Divine Life, to the Heavenly Graces, and sweet
Peaces of that Life, impossible? Alass! the Flesh is as a Grave, in which
it is shut up. Its Lusts, and Temptations are, as a mighty Stone rolled
upon the mouth of this Grave. Tempters visible and invisible are, as
Watchmen round about the Grave, to keep thee there. But be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
at any of these things, O thou disconsolate Soul! Look to thy
Pattern, the Lord Jesus; as it was with him; so shall it be with thee. A
supernatural Power, a mighty Angel from Heaven shall bind up thy
Tempters, thy Spiritual Enemies in chains of Darkness, as in a deep sleep;
shall remove the great Stone, the most powerful Lusts, and Temptations
from the mouth of thy Grave. God himself in his Power, in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Power, as it excelleth, and transcendeth all Powers, all things,
all thoughts of men, or Angels; God himself in his Almightiness, in the
infiniteness of his Power, and God-head, God himself in the immediate
naked, most potent, most high, most Glorious Appearances, and Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his God-head shall come down upon thee, shall arise, and shine
in thee, and as he riseth, raise thee together with himself into the Light
of Life. Whil'st thou lyest in Sin, thy true Person, or Life lie together
dead in thee, as to thee, But beneath thy Soul, at the bottom of it they
lie hid in God, who is the ground of every natural being, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:49838:272"/>
of all Spiritual Beings. At the season of the new birth God disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
himself in thy Soul, as a glorious ground, out of which thy Life, and
thy Jesus spring up together by degrees, like Twin-lillies, Roses from the
same stalk or root, which is Christ. Thus shalt thou rise from the Dead
with a shout of Heavenly Joys.</p>
               <p>5. Christ is the Companion in the Resurrection. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi>
he travels in birth again with them, till Christ be formed in them.
We read 1 <hi>Corin. 6. He, that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> A saint
and Christ are one Spirit by a Spiritual Marriage, which makes two Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
perfectly one, yet so, that they remain perfectly, and distinctly two
in one. When thou risest from the dead in Regeneration, thy Jesus riseth
together with thee out of that Grave in thy Heart, into which thou hast
cast him by thy Sin at the Fall, when thou in thy true Life, and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
in thee fell into the same Grave together with him. Jesus Christ, and
the Soul spring up together in the first Creation as Twins. For St. <hi>John</hi>
saith in his first Chapter of his Gospel, that without him, that is, in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
state disjoyned from Christ, was nothing made, that was made; Christ
and the Soul, like two Twin-lillies, flourished together in Paradise. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
they died by the Fall. Many times since thy birth into this world
have Jesus Christ, and with him that Beautiful, and Blessed Life, which
thou enjoyed'st in Paradise, been rising again into thy Heart into a more
excelling Paradise, <hi>that</hi> in the Spirit, and in Heaven, which is Eternal. But
alass! thou hast still thrown them back again into the same Grave in thy
flesh by the new wounds, which thy renewed Lusts, and Unbelief have
given them. Notwithstanding all this, when the set time is come, nothing can
withstand the rising in thee. Jesus Christ, and thy Soul are together born
anew in thee from the womb of Eternal Love, where they lay hid, and
wrapt up together in the Grave itself. They now come up together in

also comes up new and fresh together with them. By the same imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
and glorious operation of the God-head they break irresistibly forth
thorow the darknesses of the night, and scatters them, and breaks them
up, as it shines thorow them. How blessed is this Union and Fellowship!
Christ and the Soul ever undivided, grow up now together in the mutual
sight, in the mutual embraces of each other thorow every state and degree
of the Regeneration, or Resurrection, Light, or Darkness; Solaces or Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings;
Life, or Death. In all by the Heavenly Union they are mutually
a Crown of rejoycing one to another.</p>

which never dies in the midst of Death. Thy Life is sweet, O Believer!
How unexpressible is this pleasure to feel Jesus Christ himself, the only
delight of the Father in Eternity, the only Delight of all the Holy Angels,
