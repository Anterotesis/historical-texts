            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But moſt unfortunately falling ſince under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inquiſition of the Violent Bloody Quakers, who, by ſome of their Chief Leaders, unprovok'd, and Barbarous Aſſaults, like ſo many Wolfes, tore, and devoured him, and his Subſtance, in Three and thirty Weeks time, which he had been Labouring for all his Days, and ſorely wounded him in his Body, Mind and Reputation, to the indangering his Life, themſelves have ſince Confeſt he was amiſt; as alſo his Neighbours aforeſaid have Certified he was in a weak Diſtracted Condition at that time, his Speech taken from him, and the Uſe of his Hands; Five Weeks together, had no Suſtenance, only drank fair Water, and Six Weeks and three days kept from his wonted Courſe of Nature, otherwiſe than by Urine. And all the while uncapable of Work, notwithſtanding the <hi>Quakers</hi> gave out, he was able, and might Work, and have ſpoke too, all the while, if he had liſt. And for his refuſing to Conſent to their Lies, after he had his Speech reſtor'd to him by his Maker, and was capable to Work, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> inſtead of reſtoring, what they had moſt falſely taken, and cauſed to be taken from him, that is to ſay, his Trade, Credit, and Livelihood, fell a Curſing him and his Wife and Children, and threatned him with Plagues and Vengeance that ſhould come upon him, and be worſe than ever he was. Inſomuch, that for above theſe Twenty years laſt paſt, he has been reduc'd to the Laborious Calling only of a Taylor, and has not had Work ſufficient, nor the value thereof, taking the whole time, for one pair of hands, to feed and maintain four Mouthes the greateſt part of it. What hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips he has undergone in ſeeking for Work, but much more by their often Upbraiding him with their Bounty and Charity, ſo cold, are too long and ſad to trouble the Reader: However he is able to make it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if he might be permitted, that he is a Sufferer at this time above 500 <hi>l.</hi> in his very Trade and Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of his Family, beſides his Credit, and a Childes part of an Eſtate of about 600 <hi>l.</hi> which was left him by his Parents and near Relations at <hi>Buckingham,</hi> which ſome of the former Leven of the <hi>Quakers</hi> poſſeſt themſelves of, part of it without Adminiſtring, and other ſome, of the ſame Fry, without giving any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, have, in the like manner, lately, by their Purſes, and Practices of Lying, got the Remainder. So that the <hi>Quakers</hi> among them have Swallowed up both my ſubſtance of Bread, and not allowed me wherewith to Work for Money. And 'tis very hard to be in Age, and in Want, having hands given Man to Labour, and a Tongue to Ask wherewith, and not permitted, without he will Bely the Giver of them, or confeſs himſelf to be Lunatick, or Mad, and Lazy.
