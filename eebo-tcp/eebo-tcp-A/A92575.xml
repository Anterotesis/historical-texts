            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER From the Parliament of Scotland, To the Honourable <hi>William Lenthall</hi> Eſquire, Speaker of the Houſe of Commons.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Eſtates of the Parliament of this Kingdom having received a Letter dated the 23 of <hi>May,</hi> ſigned by you as Speaker of the Parliament, and written in the name of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>England;</hi> which Titles, in regard of the Solemn League and Covenant, and Treaties, and the many Declarations of the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, are ſuch as they may not acknowledge.</p>
            <p>As for the matter therein contained; thoſe many things of juſt reſentment, wherein ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is demanded from this Kingdom, are onely mentioned in the generall, and therefore cannot ſo well receive a particular anſwer: But if by theſe generall expreſſions, the late unlawfull En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement againſt <hi>England</hi> be underſtood, They deſire that their proteſtation againſt the ſame in Parliament, and the oppoſition made thereunto by them afterward in Arms (which they never laid down untill the Gariſons of <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Carliſle</hi> were reſtored unto the Kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> may be remembred, together with the Letter of the Houſe of Commons to the Generall Aſſembly of this Kirk, of the third of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1648: And that Lieutenant General <hi>Cromwel,</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized from both Houſes of Parliament, did upon the 5 of <hi>October</hi> laſt, repreſent to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Eſtates of this Kingdom, the wrongs and injuries committed againſt the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in that Engagement; and thereupon did demand that they would give aſſurance in the name of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> not to admit or ſuffer any who have been active in, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to that Engagement, to be imployed in any publick place or Truſt whatſoever; which was not onely granted, and afterward confirmed in Parliament, but all Acts for proſecution thereof have been repealed, and all proceeding relating thereunto publickly diſclaimed. And if any other wrongs ſhall be make known unto us, we ſhall be ready to return ſuch an Anſwer as may give juſt ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>If the Bonds of Religion, Loyalty to the King, and mutuall amity and friendſhip betwixt the Kingdoms be impartially conſidered, according to the Solemn League and Covenant, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Declarations of both Kingdoms, The Eſtates of Parliament think that they have juſt cauſe to complain of the late proceedings in <hi>England</hi> in reference to Religion, the taking away of the Kings life, and the changing the fundamentall Government of that Kingdom; againſt which this Kirk and Kingdom and their Commiſſioners, have proteſted and given Teſtimony, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they do ſtill adhere.</p>
            <p>And ſince it is apparent there hath been of late in <hi>England</hi> a backſliding and departure from the grounds and principles wherein the two Kingdoms were engaged, the Parliament of this Kingdom doth propound, that the late proceedings there againſt Covenant and Treaties may be diſclaimed and diſavowed, as the proſecution of the late unlawfull Engagement againſt <hi>England</hi> hath been diſclaimed and diſavowed here; and that ſuch as have departed from theſe principles, and their former profeſſions, may return to the ſame: Upon which grounds they are content to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uthorize Commiſſioners on behalf of this Kingdom, to treat with Commiſſioners from both Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> ſitting in freedom, concerning all matters of juſt complaint which either Nation may have againſt the other, and for redreſſe and reparation thereof, and to do every thing that may further conduce for continuing the happy peace and union betwixt the Kingdoms, which can never be ſetled upon ſo ſure a foundation as the former Treaties, and the ſolemn League and Covenant: From which, as no alteration or revolution of Affairs can abſolve either Kingdom; ſo, we truſt in God, that no ſucceſs, whether good or bad, ſhall be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us; but as it hath been our care in time paſt, it ſhall be ſtill our reall indeavour for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to keep our ſelves free of all compliance with, or inclining to the Popiſh, Prelatical and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant party upon the one hand; or to thoſe that are enemies to the fundamentall Government by King and Parliament, and countenance and maintain Errour, Hereſie, and Schiſm upon the other. I have no other thing in command from the Parliament of this Kingdom, but to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that there is no Anſwer returned to their Letter of the 5 <hi>March</hi> laſt. And ſo reſts</p>
