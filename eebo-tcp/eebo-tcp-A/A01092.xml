            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

was (ſaith he) a maſter of a family, that committed the
cuſtodie of his Orchard to two ſeruants, one of them
lame of his feet, and the other blinde. The lame ſeruant
being taken with the beautie of the apples, told his blinde
fellow-ſeruant, that if he enioyed the vſe of his limbes,
and could goe as well as he, it ſhould not be long but he
would be poſſeſſed of ſome of thoſe apples. The blinde
ſeruant ſaid, he was as deſirous of them as himſelfe, and
if he could but ſee as well as he, they ſhould not reſt long
vpon the tree. In the end they agreed to ioyne together:
the whole-limb'd blinde man tooke the well-ſighted lame
man on his ſhoulders, and ſo hee reached the apples.
Their maſter comming, and miſſing his fruit, expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

blinde man ſaid, he could not haue them, for hee could
not ſee ſo much as the tree they grew on. The lame man
ſaid, he need not be ſuſpected; for it was well knowne
he could not climbe, or ſtand to reach them. But their
maſter perceiuing their craft, how they had both ioyned
together, put them as they were, one vpon the ſhoulders
of the other, and puniſhed them both together. So in

is, the watch of our hands ouer our workes; wee muſt
watch ouer our workes, that we neither omit that which
we ſhould doe; nor commit that which we ought not to
doe. And here we muſt be ſure to keepe the moſt ſeuere
and ſtricteſt watch. For there redounds greater diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to God, and more ill examples to men, by the euill
acts of our hands, than by the thoughts of our hearts, or
the words of our mouths. If it pleaſe you therefore to
caſt the eye of your vnderſtanding vpon the Decalogue,
vpon the ten Commandements, you ſhall finde more
Commandements forbidding ſinne in action, than in
the ſpeech, or cogitation. Looke into the firſt Table;
there is one commandement forbidding ſinne in the
heart, namely, the firſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no other gods but me.</hi>
There's another forbidding ſin in the tongue, namely the
third, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in
vaine.</hi> But the other two forbid ſinne in action. Looke
into the ſecond Table, there's one Commandement for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
ſinne in the heart, namely the tenth, <hi>Thou ſhalt

tongue, namely the ninth, <hi>Thou ſhalt not beare falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

in action. And hereby we are taught, that if we will keepe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21412:16"/>
ſinne from reigning in our mortall bothe, we muſt watch

                  </gap>, here is the difference
betwixt the ſinnes of the wicked and the ſinnes of the
godly. The ſinnes of the wicked are committed with an
high hand, they meditate on them in their beds, they
commit them with all greedineſſe, they draw ſinne with
cart-ropes, they ſinne without repentance; therefore
their ſinnes are <hi>peccata regnantia,</hi> ſinnes reigning in their
mortall bodie, and neuer forgiuen them, but death and
hell reignes ouer them; they die the ſecond death, the
eternall death, the death both of bodie and ſoule. But
the ſinnes of the godly are committed without medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
through infirmitie, they are committed with a relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancie,
there's a combat betwixt the fleſh and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
they are reſiſted by watching, they are ſuppreſſed and
kept vnder by faſting, they are caſt out by praying, they
are repented of with repent mee neuer to be repented of;
therefore their ſinnes are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

reigning in their mortall bodie, but by the great mercie
of God, in Chriſt Ieſus, forgiuen and not imputed vnto
them, ſo that death hath not full power of them, they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21412:19"/>
die the death of the bodie onely, the firſt, not the ſecond
death,<note place="margin">Reuel. 14. 13.</note> and ſo die in the Lord, and die bleſſedly. <hi>For bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are they which die in the Lord, euen ſo ſaith the Spirit,
they rest from their labours, and their good works follow them,
Reu.</hi> 14. 13.</p>
               <p>In one word then to conclude all, with a true and
liuely faith in Chriſt Ieſus, reſiſt ſinne, let it not <hi>reigne in
your mortall bodie;</hi> and then you haue done all which is
required to your ſaluation: then you ſhall liue happily,
die bleſſedly, be rewarded plentifully, and poſſeſſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

grant vnto euerie one of vs. To which God the Father,
the Creator of all, and hater of ſinne; God the Sonne,
the Sauiour of all, and Redeemer from the puniſhment
of ſinne; God the Holy Ghoſt, the Sanctifier of all, and
Purifier from the prauitie of ſinne, three Perſons, one
only wiſe God, bee aſcribed of vs all, all honour,
glorie, power, dominion, might, and
