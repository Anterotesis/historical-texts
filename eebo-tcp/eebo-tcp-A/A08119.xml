         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the yeere of our Lord, 1549. when many grieuously com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained vnto King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, that their Commons were taken from them, and inclosed by certaine priuate persons: The care thereof, by the authoritie of the King was committed vnto certaine most graue, and discreete persons: and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission appointed, they were commanded aboue all things, to inquire of such complaints, and to vnderstand, and consult of the whole matter, with as much expedition as mought bee. Which comming abroad, and made knowne to the common people, sundry rumours were spred hereof, and among other things done, the ditches in Kent were filled vp, and fields som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time common (now inclosed with ditches, and hedges) were laid open. Now because the like was not done in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Norfolke, certaine light, and seditious persons of the common people began to murmur, and be grieued; and from thence-foorth they bound themselues with brutish rage and villany, that (against right, and without the commandement of the King) they would doe the like here, as they had heard done in Kent: Desiring (as the euent declared) not only to lay open the common Pastures, inclosed by the iniurie of some men, but to powre foorth their vngodly desires against the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth (hidden before in the wicked intention of their hearts) to the spoile, and ouerthrow of all things. Whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured mortall warres to their Countrie, and destruction to themselues. For when the report of this cursed Societie came abroade, they began euery where to enter secret counsels, and many base and vile persons in sundry places complained of their estate, and bitterly inueighed against the authoritie of Gentlemen, and of the Nobilitie. For, said they, the pride of<note place="margin">The Rebels complaint.</note> great men is now intollerable, but their condition miserable. These abound in delights, and compassed with the fulnesse of
<pb facs="tcp:3010:6"/>
all things, and consumed with vaine pleasures, thirst only after gaine, and are inflamed with the burning delights of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: but themselues almost killed with labour and watching, doe nothing all their life long but sweate, mourne, hunger and thirst. Which things, though they seeme miserable and base (as they are indeed most miserable) yet might be borne howsoeuer, if they which are drowned in the boyling seas of euill delights, did not pursue the calamitie, and miseries of other men with too much insolent hatred: but now both they, and their miserable condition, is a laughing stocke to most proud and insolent men, consuming with ease and idlenesse. Which thing (as it may) grieueth them so sore, and inflicteth such a staine of euill report: as nothing is more grieuous for them to remember, nor more vniust to suffer. But that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of possessing land seemeth miserable, and slauish, they hold all at the pleasure of great men: not freely, but by prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as it were at the will, and pleasure of the Lord. For as soone as any man offend any of these gorgious Gentlemen, he is put out, depriued, and thruft from all his goods. How long should we suffer so great oppression to goe vnreuenged! For so farre are they now gone in crueltie and couetousnesse, as they are not only content to take by violence all away, and by force and villany to get, which they consume in ryot, and effeminate delights: except they may also sucke, in a manner, our bloud and marrow, out of our veines and bones. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pastures left by our predecessors for the reliefe of vs, and our children, are taken away. The lands which in the memory of our fathers, were common, those are ditched and hedged in, and made seuerall; the Pastures are inclosed, and we shut out: whatsoeuer fowles of the aire, or fishes of the water, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the earth, all these doe they deuoure, consume and swallow vp; yea, nature doth not suffice to satisfie their lufts, but they seeke out new deuices, and as it were, formes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, to imbalme and perfume themselues, to abound in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant smells, to powre in sweete things to sweete things: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they seeke from all places, all things for their desire, and prouocation of lust: while we in the meane time, eate hearbs

and roots, and languish with continuall labour, and yet enuie that we liue, breathe, and inioy common ayre. Shall they, as they haue brought hedges about common Pastures, inclose with their intolerable lusts also, al the commodities and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of this life, which, Nature, the Parent of vs all, would haue common, and bringeth foorth euery day for vs, aswell as for them? We can no longer beare so much, so great, and so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell iniurie, neither can wee with quiet minds behold so great couetousnesse, excesse, and pride of the Nobilitie; we will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take Armes, and mixe Heauen and Earth together, then indure so great crueltie. Nature hath prouided for vs, aswell as for them; hath giuen vs a body, and a soule, and hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied<note place="margin">Ahellish paritie.</note> vs other things. While we haue the same forme, and the same condition of birth together with them, why should they haue a life so vnlike vnto ours, and differ so farre from vs in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? We see that now it is come to extremitie, wee will also prooue extremitie: rend downe hedges, fill vp ditches, make way for euery man into the common pasture: Finally, lay all euen with the ground, which they no lesse wickedly, then cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly and couerously haue inclosed. Neither will we suffer our selues any more to bee pressed with such burthens against our willes, nor endure so great shame, as liuing out our dayes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such inconueniences, wee should leaue the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth vnto our postcritie, mourning, and miserable, and much worse then we receiued it of our fathers.

            <p>These wretched men, and vilest of all that euer liued, being set on fire with these words, when with thankfull clamors they had compassed him about, on the sodaine, as it were gathering an assembly of men, into a certaine field of <hi>Ketts,</hi> next adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the towne of <hi>Windham,</hi> all the multitude flocked thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And as they had decreed, there they threw downe the ditches, and made them euen with the ground: which when they had done, as vnbridled horses lusting after liberty, which in the errour of their conceite, they fained vnto themselues: partly through their owne boldnesse, and trusting to this vaine successe of things; partly through the incouragement and cryes of their Captaine, being set on fire as with burning lights, it is incredible to tell with what flames of fury, to the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of our peace, and ouerthrow of our Common-wealth they burned.</p>
            <p>From thence they came to Hetherset (which is a village<note place="margin">The Rebels came to Hetherset.</note> not farre from Windham) and there they forced into the fields of one <hi>Flowerdew,</hi> filled vp the ditches, brake downe the hedges, and laid open the Inclosures. At these stirres a great contention, and altercation arose, when <hi>Flowerdew,</hi> with griefe and anger much moued, had rebuked <hi>Kett,</hi> and laid all the fault vpon him as the cause of that vnruly and rebellious rout, calling him often wretched man, the baine of his Countrey, and Captaine of Fugitiues. And by this meanes (as much as lay in him) their villainy was resisted, and their enterprises some what abated: who perswaded with all his skill, that they should dutifully lay downe their weapons, which vndutifully they had taken vp: with which words and deeds of <hi>Flowerdew</hi> they being more vehemently incensed; when compassing <hi>Kett</hi> about, they had filled the ayre with cryes, and complaints, and had incouraged one another, at length they implore and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of him, the true performance of that helpe, whereunto he bound himselfe of late.

Cod.</note> strangenesse of the matter, thought good out of hand to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide against this inconuenience, and to labour that these tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults (if by any meanes it could bee brought to passe) might be repressed in the beginning. Whereupon, calling the chiefe of the Citty together (namely the Aldermen, which alwayes are with the Maior in the counsell) to appease these tumults, he goeth with them into <hi>Ketts</hi> Campe. There he found them all wickedly occupied, giuing themselues to ryot and excesse. And first he allured them by money, and fairer promises to leaue off their enterprise, and euery man to depart quietly to his owne house. They notwithstanding continued still their purpose, throwing downe whatsoeuer was inclosed. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior when he had tryed all meanes in vaine, and perceiued that neither intreaty nor reward could preuaile any thing at all, to draw the mindes of the Conspirators from so great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to the consideration of peace, presently returneth into the City.</p>
            <p>After whose departure, the Rebels conceiued (as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,<note place="margin">A signe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the Citizens to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</note> which also they beganne to perceiue by little bowes in the hands of certaine men, which fled vnto them out of the City) that if they tarried any longer scattered, and separated one from another, their enterprise presently, without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, would be disappointed, and they resisted. To preuent this, they thought it safest, that all their cursed companies should be drawen together into one place. Whereupon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay they went to Eaton wood, which when they had viewed thorowout, and found no conuenient place to pitch their campe in; by publique consent it was agreed vpon, that from thence they should presently depart to Moushold. And chiefly they did chuse that place, wherein they might appoint seates for their wicked purposes, and dennes for their robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Therefore when this aduice liked them all, and night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">Rebels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to the Maior.</note> they were aware came on, they sent messengers vnto the Maior to signifie vnto him, that they intended without iniury to any man, to passe thorow the City, because that way was more easie and readier, and therefore they request to doe it with his good leaue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3010:9"/>Hereunto the Maior answered, that they were men of a<note place="margin">The Maiors Answere.</note> lewd minde, and enemies to the weale publique, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would giue them no passe thorow the City. Moreouer, he rebuked them sharpely and with threatning words, as men seditious, and desirous to trouble and ouerturne all things, that so striking a feare into them, he might by all meanes possible terrifie them from so great mischiefe, and cruelty. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, he gaue them to vnderstand, that if they proceeded in their fury and rage, it would sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tly come to passe, such desperat at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts would come to a fearefull end. But this speech of the Maior was so farre from terrifying them, as they departed from him more obstinate, and confirmed in their resolution then when they came. Thus <hi>Ketts</hi> Company disappointed of their hope, and intention, lurked all that night in Eaton wood. In the meane season the Maior with his Brethren called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,<note place="margin">The Maior calleth a Councell.</note> as it behoued them, for the Common-weale of their City; There it was longtime, and much debated: as of them whose mindes were carryed into doubtfull opinions. Some thought there is neede of expedition, and that without delay they are to be put to flight: For being desperately mad, and raging, if they be not in the beginning repressed, they would bring a plague and destruction to the whole City. Other thought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, that it is a matter of great danger, deliberation, and aduice, and that this speede in resisting, comming as from cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and magnanimity: so it may seeme vncertaine, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduised, whose whole commendation is in the euent. Which course, as it bringeth alwayes a doubtfull, so for the most part a dolefull end. And therefore they perswade, to fortifie the City, and appoint watch and ward carefully, and to bestow the Citizens vpon the walles, and other conuenient places of the City. As for other things, because by the Law of raising Force, and Armes, it is prouided that no Bands bee mustered without the commandement of the King, therefore nothing to be attempted (as they aduise) but to expect his will and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: All men easily inclined to this sentence, as held for the best, proceeding from the matter in question, and most safe against euery assault of Fortune. And forthwith messengers are sent post with letters vnto the King, wherein all things are
<pb facs="tcp:3010:10"/>
carefully reported, commanding that with as much speed as was possible, they should be deliuered to the Kings Councell.</p>
            <p>The next day after, that was the eleuenth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> when they<note place="margin">The Rebels goe ouer at Hailsdon Bridge.</note> could not obtaine liberty of the Maior to passe thorow the City, and all hope therof being taken away, it seemed best to them, and they all agreed, to goe ouer at Hailsdon Bridge, which because they could not easily doe, for the straightnesse of the Bridge, the way whereof was too narrow for the drift of the Cattell, and carriage, they threw great store of wood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the riuer, and so vpon the boughes, and bodies of the trees heaped vp together, men, horse, and cart, might passe ouer the Riuer. After this manner being gone ouer, the night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing they lodged at Drayton. The next day they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Moushold, casting downe on euery side hedges and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Moreouer they pulled downe a Chappell of one <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betts,</hi> and brought a desolation and miserable ruine vpon all places. Into this cursed rout of wretched men destroying, and wasting all things, and rushing into all places with headlong rage: wheresoeuer they came, <hi>Roger Woodhouse</hi> Knight, and<note place="margin">Roger Woodhouse Knight ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> the brethren of the <hi>Appleyards,</hi> fell into their company, while vnwarily they went to see which way these Rebels came. These they tooke, and against their wills carried with them. Then they tooke the hill called Saint <hi>Leonards</hi> hill, right ouer against Norwich, in which place the Earle of Surry had built a faire and sumptuous house, which hath beneath it the maine Riuer running betwixt the City, and hath on the East, and South the wood, and a little village called Thorpe: but on the East, and North, Moushold Heath, which containeth in length and breadth, more then sixe miles. Heere they placed the Chambers (and as it were) tents of their furies, and lurking those thicke woods, as dogs in their kennels, they violated all Lawes of God and man. Moreouer, they entred that goodly house, &amp; in all places thereof left the markes of their villanies.</p>
            <p>And now whatsoeuer of the vilest, and basest of the people were in any place, these came running thither; and all the dregges, and filth of the people of Norfolke ioyned themselues to this Campe: besides, a great number out of Suffolke; also
<pb facs="tcp:3010:10"/>
of men dwelling in other places, and Countries, by the ringing of Belles, and firing of Beacons, c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me stocking thither. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, they adde one mischiefe to another: for this so horrible villany and desire (seldome heard of) of destroying all things, they couer with a certaine shew of counterfeit holinesse: for they got vnto them a certaine Minister of the City, whom they<note place="margin">To Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ioyne deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> appoint to say prayers Morning and Euening. Furthermore, they endeuour to ioyne to the societie of these outrages, men any way excellent for Religion and Doctrine, and for vertue and innocencie of life commendable: Among whom, was <hi>Robert Watson,</hi> Preacher; <hi>Thomas Cod,</hi> Maior of Norwich; <hi>Thomas Aldrich</hi> of Mangreene, a man while he liued, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all men. These three because they refused to be bound to their wicked agreements, and trecherous Couenants, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their willes, they constrained to bee present at all their Consultations, and to take vpon them the administration of all things with <hi>Kett,</hi> the chiefe Rebell.</p>
            <p>Which thing fel out marueilous wel; for if it happened at any<note place="margin">Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> time (which happened often) that <hi>Kett,</hi> or any of the principal Conspirators (as they were prone, and headlong to all villany) stirred vp by the mad multitude, to goe about any wicked, and vngracious worke, which might tend in conclusion to the spoile, either of the Citie, the Fields or Townes neere the City, the wise and careful diligence of these men, often hindred such pestilent enterprises.</p>
            <p>Although <hi>Kett</hi> set on fire with mischiefe, and spurred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by the rude furies of his companions, was wont some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to send foorth Commandement, as from authoritie of prescript formes, which were called <hi>Ketts</hi> writs, whereunto sometime this importunate beast abused the names of these honest men. The Coppie of which writs followeth.</p>

            <p>Then in order other followed: for the number of Delegates were many, for besides the chiefe of this wicked societie, they chose two out of euery hundred, and there were sixe and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">2600. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels at this time.</note> hundred: and with these, and the like Warrants, many wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Great persons, whom the furie and rage of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people made guiltie, were arested. And many, as though they had been guiltie of great crimes, were led away to Mous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and there shut vp in hold and prison.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the ditches and hedges of common Pastures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed, by the authoritie of the same Commission were throwne downe, and in diuers places, many were charged to be assistant, and helpers in these tumults. And all these things were done, these three, the Maior <hi>Watson</hi> and <hi>Aldrich,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holding their peace, and winking at the matter, but also in shew sometime consenting, being often compelled to serue the time, whereby they might relieue their Country tost to and fro, in the deepe seas of sedition and discord, lest, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting at all<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> the aduersarie, and cruell common people, should haue perceiued it, and so they should haue brought present death to themselues, and destruction to their Countrie, which then without doubt (if they had openly resisted, or plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied (as farre as man could perceiue) such was their rage, and vnbridled madnesse) had vtterly perished, ouerthrowne with robberies, burning, and all kind of common calamitie.</p>
            <p>In the meane season, the Citie of Norwich, carefull of this estate of things, with an vncertaine hope, and continuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation for reliefe, remained doubtfull of these sturres: for hitherto no answere was brought vnto them from the King, neither vnderstood they what the Councell had decreed to be done; and the Citizens without commandement, durst at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing, but remained in the Citie, still looking for the Kings authoritie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3010:11"/>And it chanced at that time, many obscure and vile persons were in armes in sundry places, as bound by a common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of villany: they had conspired to teare in sunder the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Common wealth: for although the fury of rude and beastly men, did much more, and cruelly rage in the Countie of Norfolke, then any where else: yet the same mortall plague of destroying all things, was spred abroad almost through all parts of the land. Not onely Norfolke, but Buckingham, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Surrey, Essex, Kent, Cambridge-shire, and many other places were troubled with the like sturres<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Whereby it came to passe, that when all the counsels, care and studie was occupied in quenching the flames of so great seditions (lest, if they had not gone presently against the fire, all the Common-wealth had burned) they came somewhat later to represse these Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke Commotions then they wished.</p>
            <p>In the meane while sedition groweth, and loseth nothing, but daily increaseth, in so much, that of beastly men in <hi>Kets</hi> Campe, there were almost sixteene thousand; and these<note place="margin">16000. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels in the Campe.</note> went about to fortifie themselues with all meanes of defence, <hi>Kett</hi> being their Captaine; and they brought from diuers parts prouision for the warres, and al kind of weapons into the Campe.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, great store of Gun-powder, and Gunnes of all sorts a great number. To the obtaining whereof, they ran into all places, and entred the houses of Worshipfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Gentlemen, robbing them; and whatsoeuer cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel they found in the field, money in the houses, or corne in the barnes, that vngodly, and wickedly they tooke away, (yea, the owners looking vpon them) and carried it into the Campe.</p>
            <p>And many, when after this sort they had wasted, powled,<note place="margin">The Rebels rob one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</note> and emptied all places, and left miserable monuments euery where of their villanies, and made a discomfiture of all things, a great part of the prey was priuily turned another way, and thrust into holes and corners, and euery one heaped vp by stealth for himselfe, as much as their dennes could hold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3010:12"/>This being knowne, and brought before <hi>Kett,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gouernours (for so would they bee called) they being desirous aboue all to prouide against this inconuenience, by common consent they agreed, that some place should be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen where they might sit to minister Iustice. Now there was an old Oke with great spred boughes, this they laid ouer with raftes and balkes acrosse, and made a roofe with boordes: where (for the most part) the people standing round about, they determine and decree of complaints, and quarrels, (if any were done to any) as the cause required, and sometime they binde with straighter bands, the insolent and ouer-much gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy couetousnesse of some, by violent taking all away. This Oke was called the <hi>Oke of Reformation,</hi> whereunto at the first<note place="margin">The Oke of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> none came, but <hi>Kett,</hi> and the Gouernours: of the which some, and among these the Maior of the City especially, <hi>Aldrich,</hi> and others (of whom we spake before, against their wils ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in this number) contended vehemently by all meanes possible (as much as was in them) to restraine the needy, and hungry co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon people, from this importune liberty of rifling, and robbing. To the which end they went often vpon the Oke, and with their graue speeches perswaded that there might be at the length, if not an end, yet they would prouide some meanes against such rapine, and so generall violence in all excesse. There were besides also other graue Persons, and good Diuines, who endeuoured by all meanes possible, study and diligence, to reduce the tumultuous people (hauing now cast off all feare of Law) and glutting themselues in all villany, from robbery, and burning, wherewith they had confounded all things, vnto the consideration of peace. And these in the day preaching, and in the night watching armed in the City, omitted nothing that belonged vnto them as they were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers, or lay vpon them as they were good Subiects. At this time, among the rest, the wisedome, faithfulnesse, and integrity of <hi>D. Matthew Parker</hi> was notable, a worthy man, and euery way adorned with vertue, then Professor of Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at this day in the time of our most renowned Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury. Hee minding to doe the
<pb facs="tcp:3010:12"/>
office and duty of a good Pastor, seeing all places inuironed with the flames of fury, and mischiefe; did that which became a prudent, and behoued a resolute man. For in rebuking of wickednesse, he shewed himselfe stout and valiant, and in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry auoiding of perils, witty and carefull: so as hee performed the faith that he ought to God and the King, and diligently prouiding for himselfe, hee shewed that prouidence that is principally in wise men. But it came to passe one day, what time hee went with his friends into <hi>Ketts</hi> Campe, hee found <hi>Kett</hi> and other his Companions of that fellowship, standing<note place="margin">Ketts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</note> vnder the Oke, communing of matters betweene themselues. At which time the notable courage of the Maior <hi>M. Codde</hi>
               <note place="margin">The courage and fidelity of the Maior.</note> appeared, and his worthy voice was plainely heard, besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a valiant man. For when <hi>Kett,</hi> the Captayne of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, was earnest with him to deliuer the keyes of the City, and all his authority, and to resigne his gouernement into his hands, <hi>Codde</hi> stoutly answered, he would first giue his bloud, and life out of his body, before he would by villany treche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously leaue the City, or cast off wickedly through feare and cowardise, his allegeance to the King. The matter thus deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on both sides, and night drawing on, <hi>Matthew</hi> seeing the miserable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mon people drowned in drinke, and excesse, thought that sober and wholsome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>munication would little profit drunkards, ouer-charged with meat and drinke, and strooken with the heate of the weather and sunne, therefore thought good to say nothing vnto them that day. Wherefore leauing all things as he found them full of fury, and tumults, hee departeth into the Citie. The next day early, which was Friday, he returneth againe into the Campe with his brother <hi>Tho. Parker,</hi> (which was after Maior of Norwich) where (it is lamentable to tell) he found them all vnder the Oke, hearing prayers, and in the middest of them one <hi>Thomas</hi> the Vicar of <hi>S. Martins</hi> at the Palace, reading the <hi>Letanie. Matthew</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">Matthew Parkers Sermon.</note> gotten this oportunity to teach, went vpon the Oke, and there made a Sermon full of wisedome, modestie, and grauitie. All his Sermon was chiefly diuided into three parts.</p>
            <p>In the first he wisely admonisheth them, that those things
<pb facs="tcp:3010:13"/>
which for their sustentation they had brought into the Campe being consumed, and spent, they would not spoyle wickedly the fruits of the earth, and the gifts of God.</p>
            <p>Next, that they should not defile their hands with bloud, following priuate, and secret displeasures, rashly carryed with a desire of reuenge, neither to punish them with imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bands, whom they held as Enemies: or take away any mans life wickedly, or cruelly.</p>
            <p>Lastly, in regard of common profit to surcease from these enterprises, and not distrust the Kings Herald, or Messenger: but to giue vnto the King due honour, euen in his yong and tender age; whereby they might vse him hereafter, when hee came to more ripe and flourishing estate, (the valour and prowesse of his Ancestors being confirmed in him, and, as it were deepe rooted) with incredible delight and pleasure.</p>
            <p>When in this place hee had inforced all the strength of his speech, and all the company had heard him attentiuely and willingly, standing round about him while hee preached: at the voyce of one wretch of the basest of the people, they began to cry out, one by one tumultuously; <hi>How long</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous wretch.</note> 
               <hi>we suffer this hireling Doctor, which (procured for his hire by the Gentlemen) is come hither bringing words of sale, and a tongue bound with rewards? but we will cast a bridle vpon their intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power, and will hold them bound with the cords of our Law, spite of their hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the common people began to murmur, and openly to rage, and many, stirred vp with the speech of this Varlet, vrged the matter with more bitter words and threats, yea, and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full speeches of some, were heard, and dangerous, which came also to his owne eares. Some of them cried out fiercely<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> 
               <hi>It were good that hee which hath spoken so well, and hath powdred his Sermon with such eloquent words and sentences, were compelled to come downe, being shot through with pikes and arrowes.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon a great feare came vpon this good man at that time, and vnto this feare was added the terrour of another euill sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:<note place="margin">Conceite is strong.</note> for hee himselfe felt vnder his feet the points of the speares, and Iauelings, and was in great doubt, lest hee should
<pb facs="tcp:3010:13"/>
be thrust thorow of the raging multitude. Neuerthelesse, it was afterward perceiued, that there was no such cause of feare: for all that were vnder the tree (for the most part) had <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> in great reputation, and imbraced him with all loue and kindnesse, and were greatly glad of his comming thither. For they hoped it would haue come to passe, that the people being strooken in conscience with his words, and made more tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or afraid of their wickednesse and villany, would repent of their doing, or at the least, remit somewhat of their wonted fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and crueltie; and by this meanes, all that were present a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their willes, might obtaine more libertie. Howsoeuer it was, he was exceedingly afraid, and seemed to be in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>At what time on the sudden came <hi>Thomas,</hi> of whom wee spake before, Vicar of S. <hi>Martins,</hi> hauing gotten two or three Musicions vnto him, who began to sing, <hi>Te Deum,</hi> in English, with solemne Musicke, and distinct notes, elegantly set for the delight of the eare: by the sweetnesse of which Song, they being rauished (for they were vnwonted to Musicke) their cruell and raging minds (bewitched with these vnaccustomed delights) by little and little were appeased.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matthew</hi> hauing gotten this opportunitie, thought it not good to tarrie, while either these had made an end of their Song, or the other should begin a new to rage; therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming downe from the Oke with his brother (as hee could get out) he went from the Campe. And as they were going downe Saint <hi>Leonards</hi> Hill, toward Pockethorpe Gates, they came vpon him, and other ministers of that societie, following him with tumultuous clamours, which contended with him chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Rebels desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of the great Scale.</note> for the great seale, whereby he had licence to preach.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matthew</hi> therefore perceiuing, that all were infected with this villanie, as it were, running headlong with deadly furie and madnes, being wearied with such tumults, and lamenting the euils of his Countrie, escaping priuily what way hee could, leaueth his brother <hi>Thomas Parker</hi> behind him, to reason with them of the matters, and by this meanes, withdrew himselfe from their furie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3010:14"/>The next day after, <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> going into Saint <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> Church, from one of the Lessons appointed to be read, taketh vp the cause againe, to speak some thing of these perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tumults; many of the Conspirators standing round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, at what time they said nothing: but waiting his comming out of the Church, full of rage they stood round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and being come out, they followed him presently, saying; They vnderstood he had three or foure good and able Geldings, which might serue the King; therefore they willed him, that immediatly after dinner they should bee readie, for they were to vse them presently. Hereunto <hi>Matthew</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red little or nothing, but called vnto him speedily a Smith, and taking the shooes off the feet of some of them, he caused them to be pared to the quicke. The other he willed to bee anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with greene Coperasse all ouer, as though they had been tired with ouermuch trauell, and dressed with medicine. The Rebels supposing the matter to be euen so indeed (for anon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">The Rebels deceiued.</note> as they were led to pasture, seeing some swadled about the feete, and other anointed with greene medicine) they left off their purpose. <hi>Mathew</hi> not long after going out at the gates, as it were, to walke about two miles from the Citie, had his horse brought him to Kringelford bridge, where hee tooke their barks, and began his iourney towards Cambridge. But in the way, what he saw, what he heard, what furies and villanies by the seditious (which met him in his iourney) hee beheld, to speake of all, were an infinite labour. Neuerthelesse, by the goodnesse of God (when hee had escaped all these garboyles, and popular hurliburlies) at the length, being free from so great dangers, he came safe to Cambridge.</p>
            <p>The speech therefore of this worthy man (as an Oracle from heauen) was after this manner wickedly neglected and despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of most vile and beastly persons, forsaken not onely of all health, but of all hope; which, although at that time, blind and headlong through fury and madnes (as deadly, and to so great meanes of recouering their libertie, an enemie and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous) they despised and refused, yet without all doubt, from the most dolefull chances which insued, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb facs="tcp:3010:14"/>
of Gods vengeance possessed all their soules. For (as we said before) hee was the minister of this heauenly voyce, that quenching as it were, so great a fire of mischiefe in their mindes, they would speedily repent: lest the impiety of Treason, spreading further, should at length become lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their Countrey, and in the end sorrowfull, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to themselues: for all things that were diuinely, and wittily spoken by him (as though they had beene fitted by destiny to the people of Norfolke) came to passe: And the Rebels fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from one villanie to another, receiued at the last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne punishment for their so great furies.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, the Rebels (of whom we spake before) thirsting after the goods, and fortunes of Great men, had filled all places with robbery &amp; theft. Being now satiate and glutted with the spoyles, they turned at length from the desire of the prey, to violence and cruelty; going through all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Norfolke, threatning terrour and perill to all that would not stand on their part. And now the worshipfull, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen (in all places whithersoeuer their rage carryed them) being taken and brought into the Castle, it caused such a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall feare vpon all men; that many forsaking house, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and changing their apparel, lest being perceiued in their flight &amp; iourney, they might be knowne, escaped by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure &amp; by-pathes: and fearing all extremity from the Enemy, hid themselues in Caues of the earth, and thicke woods. And many hauing horse and cart, were constrayned to serue; and<note place="margin">Great cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</note> if they had none, were compelled to get elsewhere. And vnto these was commanded (that bestowing their labour and bearing their owne charges) they should carry corne and victuall to the Campe at Moushold. To whom, except they presently obeyed, was threatned the destruction of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and fields, and violence to their wiues and children. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer what worshipfull persons and Gentlemen soeuer they tooke (and they tooke many) them they bound surely with cords, as though in all villanie they had exceeded themselues. Many were deliuered to be kept in Norwich, and some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the prison, commonly called the Guild Hall, others
<pb facs="tcp:3010:15"/>
to the Castle. Some shut vp in the Earle of Surryes house, as theeues and felons: Yea heereunto it came<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that if at any time they wanted money (which they wanted often) they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled<note place="margin">The City treasury forced to ayde the Rebels.</note> the Maior of the City, out of the common treasure, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to supply their necessity. Whose importune demands, if the Maior had denied, without all doubt, they had emptied the treasury, and set the house on fire, and brought a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plague and destruction vpon all mens goods. And surely they often entred wicked counsell for the rifling of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the thing had beene done vndoubtedly, if by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry and diligence of the Maior, they had not beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes put by their hope, and indeuour. Notwithstanding many Gunnes, and much Artillery, and instruments of warre, whatsoeuer could bee found in the City, they tooke and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed away (fearing lest any thing might happen heereafter at any time against them) and carryed them into the Campe, charging moreouer all the Citizens, they should bee ready at<note place="margin">The Rebels pretence.</note> the first call to defend and helpe them, if neede require: Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, that they were the Kings friends, and being vniustly oppressed, had taken vpon them the defence of the Lawes, and of the Kings Maiesty. And not contented with this, they abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Kings name to serue their villanie, and wretchednesse. Moreouer there were certaine Commissions sent from the Kings Maiesty, giuing authority vnto diuers worshipfull, and Gentlemen, whose names were inserted in the Commissions, with commandement carefully to preuent the dangers that might insue to the Common-wealth, and to prouide that these sturres and commotions might be repressed in the beginning. When they had gotten these letters, putting out the names of the men of Worship, they caused their owne names to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in, and pulling off the Kings Seales, set them to fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3010:15"/>Moreouer, they held them for enemies (not onely) which refused to ioyne with them in their villanies, but many good Citizens (which to saue themselues fled out of the City, with their wiues and children) they accounted enemies: Who being driuen out of their houses, through the feare of so great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (when they durst remaine no longer any where) wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red heere and there, separated and dispersed, by the meanes of this generall rage and violence: And with exceeding lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and many teares bewayled the iniquity of those times, &amp; the miserable condition of their Countrey. Moreouer, they threaten the City with fire and burning, insomuch as they which remained in it, looked for nothing else but the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and ruine of all things. In the Campe was an horrible and lamentable fate of things; for when there met together a great multitude of theeues and bankrouts, from all parts of England, whome the hope of prey, and desire of ease called<note place="margin">Idlenesse the mother of mischief.</note> from their daily labour, and tilling of the ground: such mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of mischiefe were conceiued, and such vnlawfull lusts in all kinde of daliance, that my tongue abhorreth, and is asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to tell.</p>
            <p>This also is most euident, that as they had brought an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable waste, and desolation vpon all fields and houses on euery side, so whatsoeuer was brought into the Campe, was quickly spent in most gluttonous manner, surfetting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelling: Insomuch as it seemeth almost incredible, how so much prouision could be deuoured in so short a time.

What should I remember the spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Groues and Woods, which were almost vtterly rooted vp, and cut downe by the ground? all which, as much as could be cut, they burned, or which is more vile, they consumed in building their dennes and lodgings. Moreouer, there is added to this so terrible licenciousnesse (the companion for the most<note place="margin">Wretched cruelty.</note> part of such practices) cruelty. For these filthy beasts, and of all people, the vilest, laide chaines vpon the most honest and harmelesse men, and manicles and fetters vpon many, wherewith they coupled them, two and two together, and made them indure long the most bitter torture, and butchery of the Gaole.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, they appoint to euery of the gates, and entrance into the City, Porters, that none should issue out, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Constables of the Wards, to see that none went out of the City. And a great company of rude Countrymen were gathered together; who were appointed to watch and ward in certaine places: these men were prouided for by the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, to the satisfying of their desire, insomuch as many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, consuming their stocks in so great and wastfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, became vtterly impouerished for euer. And the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred conceiued against all in generall, that, most cruelly they vttered vpon those that they could come by.</p>
            <p>There was at that time one <hi>Wharton</hi> (a man of great courage,<note place="margin">Wharton hardly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried aliue to prison.</note> but not fauoured of the people) he being led towards the City to the Castle, bound with cords as a thiefe, a great companie of Rebels went round about him to defend him, lest hee should haue beene slaine in the way by the vnruly multitude. But neither his good behauiour towards them, nor honest promise, neither the diligent care of the Rebels appointed to guarde him, were sufficient to defend him, who escaped hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he was not murthered: for many attempted his death and spoile, his body also in many places was stabbed in with the points of their Speares, and Pikes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3010:16"/>Moreouer, it hapned about the time that this was done, that the Rebels were going towards the City, &amp; haling one of Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton as prisoner, against whom they burned with most cruell hatred; because he was alwayes a subtill fellow, and a man set to sale for mony (for he was a Lawyer) and as men thought of a reuenging minde, and one that vsed to raise vp Spirits, with fearefull signes, &amp; superstitious wonders. While therefore (as is said before) this man of Molton was drawne out of a wood (by the bewraying of a certaine woman) where he had hid himselfe a little before among thornes and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yers, for lack of better prouision, him they haled with them with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch and contumely, the heauens thundering horribly (not<note place="margin">A horrible thunder, rayne with hayle.</note> without the great astonishment of them that heard it) also mighty showres fell, mixt with haile, which couered the earth, and was very deepe, not farre from the Oke, called <hi>the Oke of Reformation.</hi> But this fearfull Tempest, as a signe from heauen, was so farre from appalling, or terrifying them, that, as if they had beene stirred vp by a heauenly voice, they are more fierce to all kinde of villanie, and more incensed then before. And<note place="margin">The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> with no lesse Tempest were the mindes of the worshipfull Gentlemen, whom the Clownes (with notable cruelty, and detestable fury, raging, vniustly held in bands) afflicted.</p>
            <p>All which either feared death euery day (whereof some surely are reported to haue felt) most vndeserued; or else more grieuous torture then death it selfe: and whatsoeuer else might be deuised by these filthy Robbers. For certaine of them (as if they had committed some notable villanie) were summoned before the company of these desperate Persons, as vnto iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and being set before the Oke, as at the Barre, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled<note place="margin">Ketts triall of prisoners.</note> to pleade their cause out of chaines: and when the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and rude multitude were asked what they would haue done with them; all as with one mouth cryed out: <hi>Let them be hanged, Let them be hanged.</hi> And when the Gentlemen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired againe of them, why they should vse such cruell spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, especially against them whom they knew not, and were guilty of no crime: they fiercely answered; Such wordes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<note place="margin">A Rebels reason.</note> were vsed towards them, and therefore they would vse
<pb facs="tcp:3010:17"/>
the same againe to them; and had nothing else to obiect. Though there were others that gaue this a reason of their cruel sentence, that they were Gentlemen, and therefore to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the way: for they knew well, if once they might get the Victorie, they should indure at their hands all kinde of torment, and cruelty. And therefore it were better their liues should bee taken away, whom now they had in bands (so should they enioy their ease, and security) then to giue vnto them the vse thereof, (if it were but one houre) of whom anon after they might be slaine as sheepe. So enuyed, at this time,<note place="margin">Hatred of the Gentry.</note> and hated, was the name of a man of Worship, or Gentleman, as the basest of the people, burning with more then hostile ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, desired to extinguish, and vtterly cut off, not only the Gentry themselues, but if it were possible, all the off-spring and hope of them.</p>
            <p>In this sort, when all the Countrey of Norfolke in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ner was shaken and beaten with the bloudy tempests of these dangerous tumults, and now almost twenty dayes had passed from the beginning, and nothing in the meane season any where done, but wasting, burning<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> robbing, and all things not only miserable to behold, but horrible and fearefull to heare: so great griefe had now possessed all good men, and especially the Citizens of Norwich: as at the sight of this lamentable fate of their Countrey, they were almost, with continuall sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and teares, consumed. To resist so great an inconuenience they could not, by reason of so great multitude of desperate persons which now were gathered together from all parts, into the Campe. And that which is more, to take vp Armes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the commandement of the King, was forbidden by Law, as is aforesaid. And because nothing as yet was heard from the Kings Councell, fearing daily the destructions, and fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the City, all hope of safety for the most part being taken away, and being destitute of all counsell, they remaine within the walles of the City.</p>
            <p>There was at that time by chance at London, one <hi>Leonard</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sutterton at London.</note> 
               <hi>Sutterton,</hi> a Citizen of Norwich, which fled thither for the safety of his life, as out of the common flame, and burning.
<pb facs="tcp:3010:17"/>
The Kings Councell sent for him, to enquire and finde out all the purposes and intents of the Rebels. <hi>Sutterton</hi> declareth that which he knoweth: namely, that a great multitude of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly persons were gathered together, as mighty waters, that these brought calamity and a lamentable plague vpon all places where they came. That the number increaseth euery day, that no villanie can be thought of, which they haue not determined, that the best men are laid hold off, and led away bound with chaines, houses rifled, fields wasted, Woods burnt and cut downe, all kind of beasts killed, through rage and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nothing left any where vntouched, but by a popular frenzie all things consumed. Also destruction and ruine hang ouer the City, except it bee very speedily preuented. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he hoped, yea, and he heard some secretly say, that there were many in the Campe, and in those dennes of wretched men, which if they had any hope of the Kings fauour, and that they might escape without punishment, would willingly cast off their weapons, and imbrace the Kings pardon. Therefore he besought, and earnestly, and most humbly intreated, that by publike proclamation, he would of his clemency grant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and impunity to as many as would depart from that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, for so he supposeth those meetings will easily bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued.</p>
            <p>His aduice and counsell being approued, by the authority and iudgement of the King, they appoint and decree; that it pleaseth the Kings Maiesty, to prouide a remedy in time for the distressed, and troubled Common-wealth: whereby shee may recouer her health againe, being once eased of those dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous sturres, and hurts of sedition, whereinto the plague of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyaltie had now brought her. Notwithstanding, hee would try all meanes, before hee would cut off that which is corrupt, and contagious (lest he should bring a maine vpon the rest of the body.) Therefore hee decreed, that the punishment long due vnto there obstinacy, vnthriftinesse, vngratiousnesse, and sensuality, should bee deferred for a time, and hope of safety should be offered, if they would abstain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:3010:18"/>
seueritie taken away; so as by clemencie and gentlenesse, they may be brought to peace, and a better mind.</p>
            <p>These things, after this manner, being consulted vpon, and decreed, this only remained; that this clemencie and fauour of the Kings Maiestie, might be made knowne without delay to the common people.</p>
            <p>To this end an Herald of Armes is sent post to Norwich,<note place="margin">An Herald sent to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</note> and for the more expedition, <hi>Leonard Sutturton</hi> is ioyned fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with him.

Which crie, when they renewed againe, many kneeled downe on their knees, commending with teares this kindnes and clemency of the King, seldome heard of, which no doubt, al would haue imbraced, as those, whose minds began by little and little, with shame and feare, to be ouercome and mollified, had not the most wretched speeches of some, and the most perfidious perswasions of <hi>Ket</hi> himselfe, turned them from the studie of peace, and drawne them backe againe to consent to their wickednesse.

            <p>When he had, in rage and furie, spoken these words, the<note place="margin">Kett pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Traytor.</note> Herald charged this beastly man (and infamous in so many points of villanie) with treason against the Kings Maiestie, and pronounceth him a Traitor, &amp; guiltie of high Treason.

Yet many, notwithstanding, followed him, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking their former purpose, and casting off their weapons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke themselues to the Kings mercie. All these, with the Maior, and <hi>Thomas Aldrich,</hi> went into the Citie, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Maior commanded the gates to be shut, especially Bishops Gates, because from thence directly (except speedily,

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, they deuised for the defence of the City, lest by the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in of the Rebels, and licentiousnesse of the Souldiers, all should goe to hauock. It was thought best in conclusion, that the City should be defended on euery side, the Gates &amp; walles kept, watch and ward to be had, all enterance to be shut vp: whereby the meanes of transporting victuals, being cut off, and taken away on euery side, the mindes of the Rebels being strooken through want of victuall, and weary of the Warres, might faint at length.</p>

When this great and sudden danger, vnlooked for, came to passe, and the Rebels were now entred the City, all things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately seemed to goe to ruine, &amp; feare possessed the minds of all.

Therefore they were all called for, and againe committed to close prison. Notwithstanding it was afterward vnderstood, that the enemies were gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine out of the City into the Camp the same way they came. When this danger was ouer, the Maior and his Brethren, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the Conspirators to plot on euery side the death and
<pb facs="tcp:3010:19"/>
destruction of men and goods, they gaue themselues wholy to study for the preseruation of the Citie. Wherefore ten of the greatest peeces of Ordinance were planted against the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies<note place="margin">Ordinance in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle ditch.</note> in the ditch (called the Castle ditch) and well placed for the defence of the Citie, if any force and assault should bee made. Moreouer, they appoint watch and ward, especially in those places, where through tract of time, the walles were weake and decayed: Who were commanded forthwith to remayne in those places; that if any danger should happen from the enemy in the night, they might presently with stones<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Pikes, and other prouision, bee driuen from the walles, and Gates of the City. The rest of the multitude were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that all of them armed, should bee ready in the Market place, and crosse streets of the City, for euery occasion.</p>
            <p>And because it seemed that the Ordinance (whereof wee spake) placed in the Castle ditch, and ruines of the walles, did not much annoy the enemy, not bring any defence vnto the City: At the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mandement of the Maior they were all brought into the plaine, &amp; speedily bestowed in the Meddowes which lye to the lowest part of the City, and all the night following<note place="margin">A fearefull night.</note> (for the most part) was spent in fearefull shot on both sides.</p>
            <p>The next day, the Rebels (perceiuing of all that tumult in the night, more feare then hurt to the Citie: because the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets from their Ordinance, mounting ouer the City, had done no harme) brought all the Ordinance they had, from the Hill, into the Plaine, and planting them at the bottome of the Hill, beganne to assault the City afresh: but because soone after, the Campe beganne to be distressed for victuall, that they might more commodiously being prouision from the places neere adioyning, they agree to make truce with the Citizens for a time. Therefore they ordayne to this office as Ambassadours, one <hi>Iames Williams,</hi> and <hi>Rafe Sutton,</hi> beastly men, and of the common people of the City of Norwich the basest.

            <p>These things with speed returned to <hi>Kett,</hi> and his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Campe, being much mooued hereat; with a brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke rage (as wild furies) they came running downe the hill with a cruell and despitefull noise, crying out. And when they came neere the Gates, they practized with all their forces to breake into the Citie, but being driuen backe with pikes and arrowes, they left that enterprise. At that time all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (as was said before) being placed in the meddowes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Citie, was spent vpon the enemie: but for lacke of powder, and want of skill in the Gunners, to small or little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Yet many being shot with arrowes were wounded; which when they fell thicke vpon the ground, the beardlesse boyes of the Countrie (whereof there were a great number) and others of the dregges of the people, men most filthy, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered them vp, and carried them to the enemie: And the minds of them all were so inflamed, as the very naked, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed boyes (as though a certaine frenzie had bereaued them of the sense of vnderstanding) running about, prouoked our men with all reprochfull speeches. There was added also to their importune cursed words, an odious, &amp; inhumane villany:<note place="margin">A beastly villany.</note> for (with reuerence to the Readers) one of these cursed boyes, putting downe his hose, and in derision, turning his bare but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks to our men, with an horrible noise and out-cry, filling the aire (all men beholding him) did that, which a chast tongue shameth to speake, much more a sober man to write: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shot thorow the buttocks, one gaue him, as was meete, the punishment he deserued.

<pb facs="tcp:3010:21"/>
Rebels that were about them, whereby yet at the least, they might bee turned vpon vs againe: so great a desire was there almost in all ages of spoiling, and so great a thirst of shedding bloud.</p>
            <p>In the meane season, when on the other side of the Citie, a fearefull crie began; <hi>To your weapon, To your weapon; Citizens,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies policy.</note> 
               <hi>if ye be men, to your weapon, the enemies are entred the Citie:</hi> and all men on the sudden ran thither, as is the manner of men in feare, where especially the greatest tumult and noise is heard. The Rebels beholding these things from the hill, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Citizens thinne vpon the walles, and before the Gates of the Citie, resolued presently to enter the Citie where it was void of defence. There the boyes (of whom wee spake before) and a great company of Country Clownes, did hazard a thing not only marueilous to see, but incredible to heare. For the vnarmed multitude, and others, part with Clubbes and Swords, others with Speares, Staues and Iauelins, (as chance could arme euery man on the sudden) cast themselues head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the Riuer that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>passeth the Citie, at the Bridge, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Bishops Gates Bridge. Who, without feare, swimming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and flying to the Gates with out-cries, and most tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous noise, strooke such a terrour in the minds of all men, as there was none almost, which thought not that day, the day of doome, both to their Citie, and to themselues. Therefore all for the most part (being afraid and discomfited) fled, and as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man could find the way to his house, and the secret places thereof, they creepe in, leauing the Citie vndefended. But the Rebels, pulling off the barres of the Gates; whatsoeuer Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or instruments of warre they found in the Citie, they carried with them into the Campe. There when some of our friends among them vpon the miserable sight of these things, were strooken with sorrow and compassion, and with lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table voice, and waterie eyes, prayed God to turne these cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities from the Citie: The Boyes and Country Clownes, which stood round about, mocked them, calling them traitors, and in most vile maner they were vexed, and grieued, with cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and reuilings. But the Gates after this sort set open (as
<pb facs="tcp:3010:21"/>
was said before) when all things were disordered through the boldnesse, and violence of the Rebels (for they came to and fro out of the Campe into the City.) The Herald (for as yet he was in the City, neither was the last day appointed by the King (for the multitude to lay downe their weapons) yet past) came with the Maior into the market place, accompanied with a great number of Citizens.</p>
            <p>There againe in the Kings name, hee commandeth them to<note place="margin">Pardon of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered again.</note> put off their armour, to leaue the Campe, euery one to depart home to his owne house, and to vse reuerently and humbly the Kings mercy and clemency. If they would so doe; then they should be safe, and free from all punishment. Otherwise, there is nothing to be looked for; but grieuous torments, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, and all extremity. When hee had made an end of speaking, the Rebels cryed out very arrogantly and fiercely,<note place="margin">Pardon refused.</note> saying; Let him depart with a pestilence, and on the deuils name, with his idle promises: He was mad, that infusing such flattering speeches into their eares, did beleeue that they being bewitched with such intising words, would bee oppressed, and circumuented in the end. They detested such mercy, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defied it; as which in apparant offering a slender and vaine hope of impunity, would cut off treacherously all safety.</p>
            <p>The Herald perceiuing now all of them giuen ouer, and (as it were) bondslaues to fury and villanie; and that they could neither by the feare of punishment, nor hope of impunity be brought from their intended wickednesse: without anything done presently, leaueth the City, and returneth to the Court. Soone after whose departure, the Rebels commanded <hi>Leonard</hi>
               <note place="margin">Leonard Sutterton sought.</note> 
               <hi>Sutterton</hi> to bee brought before them, that so they might lay him in chaines: because hee had beene companion with the Herald in his iourney. But <hi>Sutterton</hi> vnderstanding the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: fearing also lest the mad, and turbulent people, burning towards him with malice (as they did towards all good men) might deale cruelly with him, hid himselfe priuily in the City amongst his friends and kindred.<note place="margin">The Maior put in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Then <hi>Kett</hi> tooke the Maior, <hi>Robert Watson, William Rogers,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3010:22"/>
               <hi>Iohn Homersone, William Brampton,</hi> and many others, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to bee brought out of the City into the Campe, and so to prison, where chaines were put vpon them all, and they were shut vp in Mount Surrey, and there remained pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, and in irons, vntill the last day of this conspiracy; at the length some of them were set at liberty, others cruelly slaine.</p>
            <p>While these and the like were tumultuously done in the<note place="margin">Kett di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the worst choise</note> Campe; <hi>Kett</hi> perceiuing the matter was come to this passe, that he must of necessity, either haue a bloudy victory against his Countrey, or else shortly receiue an end worthy his deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, thought it best for his affaires, if hee could draw a huge multitude together, for the increase of his Army. Wherefore he allured by rewards, and faire promises, all fugitiues on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery side, as many as could be gathered together, and men that had nothing to take to, and were without hope of any thing, to ioyne themselues to the fellowship of this cursed company. Whereupon, it is incredible to tell, how great, and almost innumerable multitudes of gracelesse persons, on the sodaine were assembled.</p>
            <p>But the Citizens tooke it grieuously, that their Maior, a<note place="margin">The Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of their Maior.</note> worthy and vpright man, should bee holden bound of wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched murtherers, and as it now seemed, thirsty of bloud: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer in bonds should sustaine the contumely, and shame of the prison: fearing also lest in the end hee might bee slaine by violence: because some of them threatned him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grieuous things: others scurrilously and scoffing, iested at the good mans name, and that dangerously, as pretending death vnto him after a sort. For being called <hi>Codde,</hi> by name, and there is a fish of the Sea called after the same manner (in Latine called <hi>Capite</hi>) in contempt of the worthy Maiors name, and to his no little danger, one varlet ministring occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">The Maior in great danger.</note> vnto another of laughter and scoffing, they made an O, yes; and cryed, As many as would come to the Campe to morrow, should buy a Cods head for a penny. Herevpon the Citizens fearing lest the seditious should determine any thing grieuously against him: and being marueilously troubled in
<pb facs="tcp:3010:22"/>
minde, and carefull of the Maiors danger, hauing deserued so well of them; they came vnto <hi>Thomas Aldrich,</hi> complaining one by one, of this importunate boldnesse, and vnbridled vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. This <hi>Aldrich</hi> (as wee said before) was a man beloued of all men; and ruled with such wisedome, grauity<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty (for he was a man of a fine and sharpe wit) that euen his name was fearefull to the most barbarous enemie. For, when al men loued him exceedingly, maruailing at his singular cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie and modesty, in as much as among the chiefe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, he had that command in short time, as neither his aduice, nor enterprises were at any time in vaine. Therefore, much of the goods that were taken away of the Rebels by violence, through his industry were restored again to the owners, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pestilent attempts of the seditious, by his prouidence &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence were restrained. When therfore he vnderstood in how<note place="margin">Aldrichs speech to Kett, for the Maiors liberty.</note> great danger the safety of the life of the Maior was: being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the indignity of the thing, hee went to <hi>Kett</hi> into the Campe, and willeth him to set at liberty, and out of bonds, the Maior of the City. Hereunto, when <hi>Kett,</hi> as it were perplexed in minde, said nothing, <hi>Aldrich</hi> cryed with a loud voyce, <hi>Art thou not ashamed, wretched Traytour, to hold in prison and irons, I say, not alone an harmelesse man, but a Maior, which is the Kings Maiesties most faithfull Lieutenant? Art thou so fierce and cruell, that when through ryot and excesse, thou hast wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the goods and commodities of all men, thou canst now not bee satisfied, nor filled, except thou mayest drinke vp at last also the bloud of innocent persons? Therefore thou the wretchedst man the earth beareth, command him forthwith to bee brought out of prison.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words, as flashes of lightning, sharpely bent against <hi>Kett</hi> (whether it were for the reuerence of the man that spake, or which is most like, of a conscience of his wickednesse) strooke such a feare and terrour in him, as the thing which others could not obtaine with intreaty and all perswasion, he brought to passe with threats and grauity of speech. By whose wisdome, the Maior hauing obtained his liberty, although he could not altogether auoid al the storms of that turbule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t time:
<pb facs="tcp:3010:23"/>
yet he escaped happily both the grieuousnes of imprisonment, and danger of his life. Wherefore, hauing liberty to goe all about in the City, his care and diligence was a great comfort to many of the Citizens afterward, against those euils which at that time oppressed the City. And for as much as he could not sit continually in the gouernment of the City, because (for the most part) hee was constrained to abide in the enemies Campe, he deputed one <hi>Augustine Steward</hi> in his roome, to take the charge of desending, and gouerning the City in his absence. Who taking vnto him, <hi>Henry Bacon,</hi> and <hi>Iohn At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinson,</hi> then Sheriues of Norwich: ruled the City carefully, and kept all the Citizens easily in order (except the vnruly) who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> no good order could command. But here must needs be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, what seuere, and sowre Iudges, the seditious were vpon them; whom hauing in prison and bonds, they afflicted with all opprobry, and shame: whose cruelty and wickednesse was so great, as those, whom they had first oppressed with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable villany, and seldome heard of, them (at the length vexed, and afflicted with extreme miseries) they deliuered to the mad multitude to be slaine. For a day was appointed, when they that were in hold, should be brought forth openly as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours,<note place="margin">The order of trying innocent men.</note> that (after a preposterous manner of Iudgement) a quest might passe on them. Then <hi>Kett</hi> openly, all men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him, went vpon the Oake (which they called the Oake of Reformation) and there fate downe: euery one of the prisoners in order were called by their names: then his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was to inquire of his fauorites, and companions in that vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie, what they thought of them. The furious varlets being made Inquisitors, and Iudges of the liues of innocent men; if they found nothing of the man in question, cryed out, <hi>A good man, bee is a good man;</hi> and therefore ought to bee set at liberty. But if by the least suspicion of any small crime, his fame that was named, was but once touched; or if any thing (though the least) were found wherein perhaps he had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any one of them: some one (of the people) answered; whose voyce the other of the common sort followed, as it were stirred vp of the furies; <hi>Let him bee hanged, Let him bee</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3010:23"/>
               <hi>hanged:</hi> although they were vtterly ignorant of the man in question, whether white or black, old or yong (as one whose name was neuer heard of before) yet after this manner they were alwayes wont to cry out.</p>
            <p>And in this manner these pestilent Traytors, not led by iudgement or reason (lest they should be vnlike themselues) but led by a certayne blinde and headlong rage of the minde, (as by a mighty Tempest) oftentimes with a word, and as it were with a madde nod of their furies, they inflicted most cruell punishment vpon innocent and iust men. And surely so great was the strength of the disease, and as it were corruption that possessed the mindes of them all: as being almost without sense, and through the crueltie of so great villany hardened; they violated all Lawes of God and Man, with their great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and boldnesse.</p>
            <p>Not many dayes after, by the commandement of the King, authority was giuen vnto <hi>William Pari</hi> Marquesse of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton, to leuy an Armie of men, with commandement to goe in all haste to the City of Norwich, and there to doe his indeuour: that because these so great furies could not by cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and lenity be appeased, to pursue with fire and sword, <hi>Kett</hi> and his Confederates, as Traytors and most cruell Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to his Maiestie. Northampton, all things prepared and<note place="margin">Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons Army. 1500.</note> made ready to his liking, with fifteene hundred Souldiers (as was commanded) goeth shortly after towards Norwich. There were with him in his Armie two Lords, <hi>Sheffield</hi> and<note place="margin">Lords. Knights.</note> 
               <hi>Wentworth<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               </hi> besides, <hi>Anthony Denny, Richard Southwel, Ralph Sadler, Iohn Gates, Thomas Paston, Henry Beding field, Iohn Suliard, William Wilgraue, Iohn Cuttze, Thomas Cornwallies,</hi> all Knights: to these of Esquires &amp; Gentlemen aswell of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<note place="margin">Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tlemen.</note> as of Italy a worthy traine. When they were now but a mile from the City, the Marquesse of Northampton sent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently an Herald, which (as the manner is) should denounce Warre to the City, except they would presently obey. By whom al things which are accustomed to be done (being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed and performed in the City) <hi>Augustine Steward</hi> the Maiors Deputy sendeth speedily Messengers, to signifie vnto

That (asmuch as by mans reason could be foreseene) hee had vsed all diligence that these tumults might haue been restrayned at the beginning: yet could he not bring to that passe, by reason of the rage of the mischiefes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the mindes of all were holden intangled. That he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the terror of imprisonment, the perill of death, finally all extremity at their hands, and at this time was holden in the<note place="margin">The Maior kept by a guard in the Campe.</note> Campe, with a guard of Souldiers round about him. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he would come himselfe without delay (as was meet) to the Marquesse of Northampton. Neuerthelesse, that the City might be kept the better in order, he had giuen his authority of gouernement to <hi>Augustine Steward,</hi> a very carefull and wise man: lest, in his absence, the people through ignorance might fall away from their duty. That the City should be at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and himselfe (if <hi>Kett</hi> would permit) would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly come out of the Campe and receiue him, and commit his owne, and the state of the City to his protection. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of the Maior was carryed with speede by the Herald to the Earle of Northampton. The Maiors Deputy, with the Sherifes, and a great multitude of Citizens following, went presently into the Armie of Northampton, vnto whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the Sword (which is a signe of the Kings Maiesties presence, and of his Authority, and in the chiefe Cities of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is wont alwayes to bee carryed before the Maior) decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as the Maior had done before, that hee could not come himselfe (which he most desired) but that he and the chiefe of the City were come to deliuer the City themselues, and all that they had, vnto the faith, and authority of the King: they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse there are many of the Citizens which could not be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
<pb facs="tcp:3010:24"/>
but that they would needes consent to the Rebels: but yet the greatest part of the best Citizens doe remayne still in their faith, and allegeance, and haue not ioyned themselues with the others, nor in any respect haue conspired against the Kings Maiestie: and that this part is ready, and willing to doe that which shall be inioyned them and most willing to receiue him and his Armie into the City. Northampton againe incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the hearts of the Citizens with good words, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed he would haue care of the City, and had good hope<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> that ere long these great furies, wherewith now almost all things were set on fire, should be suppressed. When he had made an end of speaking, he deliuered the Sword to <hi>M. Southwel,</hi> who carryed the same bare-headed before the Marquesse into the City. This honor by an old and soiemne custome, is giuen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to the Kings Lieutenants. And comming in at Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> Gate, he gaue commandement that all the Citizens should come vnto him into the Market place. There they long consulted, and many things of many were deuised, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for the defence of the City, as for restrayning the assault of the Enemie.</p>
            <p>Then were appointed Watch and Ward vpon the Walles and Citie Gates. And in all places, if any were thought too weake, were appointed armed men that might be ready vpon euery occasion.</p>
            <p>These things thus appointed and performed, Northampton went at night vnto the house of the Maiors Deputie, and supped there with his company of Nobles and Gentlemen: when supper was ended, although through the tediousnesse of the iourney, and heat of the weather, all in the house were weary, yet they rested that night in their Armour, lest they might be taken vnawares.</p>
            <p>And here it came to passe, whether by chance, or of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, I cannot yet tell, that certaine Italians skirmished with a great company of the Rebels; and many wounds were giuen on both sides: but one of the Spaniards, while he went very boldly into the middest of the Rebels, being a valiant man, first, the multitude beset him round, at the length they tooke
<pb facs="tcp:3010:25"/>
him, and put him to a shamefull death: for taking away all his garments and furniture which were vpon him (very costly and cunningly wrought) they stripped him naked, and so hung him vpon an Oke in Mount Surry house, not without many reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and shamefull contumelies before his death. All men surely tooke great griefe from so cruell, and miserable a death of such a worthy, and most noble Souldier; and would with a great summe of money willingly haue ransomed him (if it had been possible) from so cruell ignominie and shame. But from this mans calamitie now in the very beginning was easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, how great and detestable cruelty raigned in those, that had wickedly taken vp Armes against their Country: although not long after by the prouidence of God (for hee suffereth not the wicked to indure long, nor the shedding of innocent bloud alwaies to go vnreuenged) <hi>Cayme</hi> himselfe the Author<note place="margin">Cayme the author of this mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> of this dreadfull villany, with the same manner of death (though somewhat too late) receiued conding punishment of this so great crueltie.</p>
            <p>But the Earle of <hi>Northampton</hi> fearing the breaking in of the enemie in the night, commanded that the Porters and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (which before wee said were bestowed vpon the Walles and Gates of the Citie) should now more painefully and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently (then commonly they were wont) walke round about the Citie. Whereby both their eyes and minds prepared, and attending vpon the enterprises of the enemie, if peraduenture any tumultuous rage should be raised in the night, might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily with their helpe, and without any great adoe be met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and resisted. Which surely was faithfully performed by the Captaines ouer hundreds. And all the other souldiers watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Market place, where gathering great heapes of wood together, they set them on fire, lest if any thing should happen on the sudden, our men being hindred, by reason of the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the night, and ignorance of the place, might be inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnawares, by the practices of the enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward Warner</hi> (one of the company of the Gentlemen) and at that time Gouernour ouer the souldiers (commonly called Marshall) gaue the Watchword. And vnto <hi>Thomas Paston, Iohn</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3010:25"/>
               <hi>Clere, William Walgraue, Thomas Cornwallis, Henry Bedingfield:</hi> men of approoued valour and wisdome, diuers parts of the Citie were disposed for the defence thereof, which tooke their charge, and with all their indouour performed their parts valiantly, continually coursing from place to place, incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and animating our m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n: sometime with their words, sometime with their countenance, sometime with their owne trauell and labour. And thus by their wise counsels they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented the pestilent enterprises of the Rebels.</p>
            <p>All things now done to their liking, the Earle and all his company (they onely excepted, as was said before, to whom the care and defence of the Citie was committed) being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with three daies trauell, purposed now to take their rest. But when our men were in their sweete sleepe, and in the dead of the night, the Rebels, as if they should presently breake into the Citie, with a terrible peale of Ordinance, and most feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full with out-cries, filled all places: Although by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it came to passe in this businesse, as the iron bullets dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the great Ordinance against the Citie, flying continually ouer our heads, did no great harme, whether it were by reason of the violent force of the powder mounting them, or the vnfaithfull hands of the Gunners, of set purpose leue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling<note place="margin">Some think Ketts Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</note> somewhat higher then was requisite (for there bee some that thinke the Gunners were corrupted with money) for the nonst. Which things verily while they were done after this manner (though alwaies without hurt) yet they were very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten done of these vile and importune robbers, which with their continuall rushings<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and horrible ecchoes, brought such a terrour, as our watchmen on the Walles, and keepers of the Gates cried often, <hi>To your weapons;</hi> which while they did many times (for the enemie neuer left raging) the Earle (which gaue charge, that if the Rebels should tumultuously in the night at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing against the Citie, he should haue knowledge, being awaked by one of the Captaines) came presently into the Market place, garded with his Nobles &amp; Gentlemen that were with him. Afterward, the better to prouide for the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and seldome returne of the souldiers, and that the Citie
<pb facs="tcp:3010:26"/>
might be the easier defended, they tooke this Counsell, that all the Gates that were on the other side of the City from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the breaches of the walles should be blocked vp, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that so, neither the souldiers should be wanting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send the Walles, if the Forces were drawne to a neerer straite, and the Enemy (without danger) might be driuen from ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance into the City.</p>
            <p>While matters began thus to bee ordered, and were almost brought to an end: The Rebels all at once, as a violent streame, came running from their dens with confused cries, and beastly howlings, and ran into the Citie. There some goe about to set<note place="margin">A fearefull fight in the night.</note> the Gates on fire, and to hew them downe: others clime vp vpon the Walles, some swim through the Riuer; many conuey themselues into the Citie by the lower places, and breaches of the old Walles. On the other side, our men begin to practise all meanes against them, and to resist with all violence, and repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed valiantly the enemy on euery side, being already entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Citie, and manfully driue them backe (now comming, and flocking thither) and with Pikes, Arrowes, Swords, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther instruments of warre put them to flight, and brought the matter to that passe, as the force of their incursions by little and little being broken, and cut off, they began somewhat to wauer and doubt of the matter. But the fight was on both sides, with most inflamed minds (cruell, fierce and bloudie) while these by force (if by any other way) goe about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey themselues into the Citie, and our men indeuour to put them from all entrance. Therefore by the space almost of three howers, they fought with most deadly hatred betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and the battell was performed more fiercely in diuers parts of the Citie, then a man would beleeue or thinke; euen with so dangerous, and dolefull an euent, as except the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding desire of our men to fight, and the worthy valour of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston, Walgraue,</hi> and the rest of the Gentlemen, had remained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible; that night without doubt, had been vnto vs all the most miserable night that euer was. For the minds of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels<note place="margin">Desperate rage.</note> were so set on fire, and incensed, and the desire to fight so exceeding, as, although they were fallen downe deadly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb facs="tcp:3010:26"/>
yet would they not giue ouer, but halfe dead, drowned in their owne, and other mens bloud, euen to the last gaspe, furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously withstood our men. Yea, many also strooken thorow the brests with swords, and the synewes of their thighes and hammes cut asunder (I tremble to rehearse it) yet creeping on their knees, were mooued with such hellish furie, as they wounded the buttocks and thighes of our souldiers, lying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the slaine almost without life. But our men perceiuing at the length the force of the enemie to abate and weaken, rushed vpon them with such violence, as they could no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger abide the fight, nor stand to resist: but their forces being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, and beaten downe on euery side, with a mightie slaughter, they were chaced, and driuen out of the Citie, (for three hundred fell in that fight) and betooke themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine<note place="margin">300. Rebels slaine in fight.</note> to their filthy dens and caues. The battell ended, few of our men were found dead, but many wounded. And now at the last, being secure from all practices of the enemy, the rest of that night that remained (and there remained but little) they gaue vnto their rest.</p>
            <p>In the Morning, assoone as it was day, certaine of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens signified vnto the Earle of Northampton, that there were many of the Rebels in <hi>Ketts</hi> Campe, whose furie was greatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and the heate of their rage quenched; these easily, and without any great adoe, might bee perswaded, that forsaking that cursed fellowship of desperate persons, they would suffer themselues to be drawne to the remembrance of their duties, and more wholsome counsell; for they were wearie of the wickednesse they had long committed: and there were now abiding at Pockthorpe Gates, foure or fiue thousand men, which waite for nothing else, and desire nothing more then peace and pardon. Which if now at the last might be offered vnto them by him, they hoped that forth with they would cast off their weapons, and commit themselues to the Kings fauor and mercie.</p>
            <p>The Earle from this message conceiued singular ioy and gladnesse, as one that had rather obtaine an easie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudie victorie, then (although they were Rebels, and

Therefore he sendeth the Herald presently with a Trumpetter, commanding him to promise vpon the faith of the Kings Maiestie, that all shall escape without punishment that wil forsake their Armes. These comming speedily to Pockethorpe Gates, found none there notwithstanding: yet the Herald gaue a signe by a Trumpet. Whereat, when they came flocking (from the Campe) downe the hill: Hee be holding one <hi>Flotman,</hi> a fierce and cruell fellow (for hee as principall came downe the hill) with a loud voice, commanded him to stand.

All mens hearts, for the most part, were smitten with so great feare, as many (through sorrow and anguish) hauing their minds alienated from the regard of their goods, left their wiues and children, and all their possessions, in the power of the Enemie.

            <p>The City therefore taken after this sort, by the conspirators, set on fire, spoyled and wasted, when desolation occupied all places euery where (except the enemies) for they that remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the City, shutting their gates and doores hid themselues in the most secret places of their houses. The Maiors Deputy alone, as it were reserued to behold the miserable spectacle of his Counties downefall, void of all aduice and helpe, when he beheld, from the vpper part of his house, all things consumed with fire, and ruinated: supposing the enemies, as they had brought destruction vpon the houses, would not long after offer violence, and death vnto men, shutting his doores, kept himselfe within his house. But the power of the enemies, in the meane time waxing great, and gathering a band of men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: they broke into the City, at Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> gates, and<note place="margin">Augustine Stewards house abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> all of them being armed with clubs, and such weapons as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans lotte could afford him: they came running vnto the house of the Maiors Deputie, and assayed to breake vp the doores: at length when they began to set them on fire, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatly afraide (for all his seruants were fled from him) himselfe alone vnshut the gates: whom presently they tooke, and plucked off his gowne (which hee vsed at that time) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

him Rebel; and threatning him a most shameful death, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he would tel them in what place the Earle of Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was hidden: when he answered, They were all departed.</p>
            <p>All of them tooke that answer, with great indignation and outcryes, most tumultuously rushing with all violence into his house, they searched furiously all the corners thereof. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward turning to the prey, they depart loaden with the spoyle. But many (being restrained partly by reason of money, and other things which they receiued of the Deputy: and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the speech of a certaine person, which said vnto them, such doings were intolerable: yea, theft and villanie; by all kind of punishment to be reuenged and repressed) brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine their packes and burthens, which they had carryed away before, and laide them in the shops and warehouses. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse many of the Citizens, into whose houses the Rebels had entred, onely vnder pretence of seeking the Earle of Northampton, were vtterly robbed of all that euer they had. Chiefly they spoyled their houses, which were gone out of the City, proclaiming them Rebels, and open enemies to the Kings Maiesty; and therefore their goods to bee confiscate. Notwithstanding, some of the Citizens tooke order, there should be deliuered to the furious multitude, bread &amp; drinke, and all kinde of victuall, whereby it came to passe, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable and hungry people being pacified, they were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what stayed from the rage of spoyling. Neuerthelesse, very many (vpon this sodaine calamity) sustained great losse and iniury; and were so ouercharged with such great expenses, that euer after while they liued (and many liue at this day) in their houshold affaires, fared the worse. In the meane season, the remembrance of future times (as it seemed) came into the mindes of the Rebels. Wherefore being now turned from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, they beginne to thinke of their owne safety: therefore they commanded the Maiors Deputy, and the chiefe of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: that watch and ward should be kept from house to house, by the Citizens euery day at all the gates of the City, which if they shall refuse to doe, they threaten death and grieuous torments.</p>

And so farre grew their malapertnesse, boldnesse, and desire of ouerturning of things: as neither the speeches of the wise, nor the feare of Gods vengeance, nor the teares and lamentations of women, could remoue them from their villanies. For the women (when they saw the<note place="margin">The women intreate.</note> slaughter of harmelesse naked men) oft times offered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the streets; intreating them to haue compassion, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Countrey, vpon them, their husbands and children, and remember that they were men themselues, begotten of men, and that they had reuenged themselues sufficiently vpon those, for whose cause they took vp Armes: that they would at last cast a bridle vpon their rage; so should they obtaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt peace and pardon, and all good things else of the Kings Maiesty: but (as wee saide before) neither threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,<note place="margin">Rebels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable.</note> nor the counsell of the wise, nor flattering prayers, nor any thing else could restraine them from so great rage of vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie, vntill they had brought a miserable destruction vpon the Country, and drawne vpon themselues at last, an ende worthy such wickednesse. For the King, after hee vnderstood that his Maiesty was daily more and more despised, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of lewd persons to increase, all things confounded with this execrable and raging tumult, the clemency of the King set at nought, and now no place left for mercy, soft medicines to auaile nothing at all, their mindes to be without cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wherfore in the Country of Lyncolne, &amp; other shires of the Kings Kingdome, he commandeth, and appointeth a muster, and presse of Souldiers. Also a great number of Swyssers to be sent for, supposing (as the thing required) that this wicked rout, and their followers, ought to be vtterly taken away by the sword. Otherwise, if it should spread further, and infect the neighbour Countrey people, with the contagion of this villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
<pb facs="tcp:3010:30"/>
it could very hardly be stayed, when the heat of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection had spred further, and fallen as it were, into the veynes and bowels of the Kingdome, and had inclosed all the parts thereof, with that deadly flame of disloyalty.</p>
            <p>Vnto this army was <hi>Iohn Dudley,</hi> Earle of Warwick, a<note place="margin">Earle of Warwick appointed Lieutenant</note> man of great Nobility, and marueilous courage, appointed Lieutenant, and vnto him the chiefe soueraignety is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by Letters and Commandements from the King. At that time the opinion (by the report of all men for the most part) was receiued among our Countreymen of him: that this Noble man was of such Magnanimity, and experience in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall affaires: as it was thought the Rebels should be suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by him, or else surely put to flight by none.</p>
            <p>Therefore these speeches of the Kings preparation and power being disperst abroade, and entring the eares of the common people, came at the length vnto the hearing of the Campe. And when they vnderstood of a surety that they were mustered, and a Captayne, Armour, Bands of men, and all instruments for the terror of Warre, prouided against them to bee readie, and at hand: they beganne euery day to fortifie<note place="margin">The Rebels fortifie.</note> themselues, and to looke about for all things necessary, and to trayne themselues, that they might bee the more able to make resistance. So farre was it from them, that either reason could mitigate their crueltie and boldnesse, or terror breake their stout mindes.</p>
            <p>To this end, when some of the Citizens obserued that many things were done euery day more tumultuously, fearing all violence, slaughter, robberie, burning, and a lamentable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-throwing of all things: At the length (lest if they should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in the Citie, they might be constrayned to be on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels side) gathering all their goods together in heaps, asmuch as they could conueniently, and hiding them in the ground, or<note place="margin">Citizens flye the City</note> else by Masons helpe, couering them with lime and stone, they fled priuily in the night out of the Citie.</p>
            <p>The Earle of Warwick, after he had furnished himselfe with Souldiers at home, and from beyond the Seas, with Money, Weapons, and all things necessary for the Warres, departeth
<pb facs="tcp:3010:31"/>
from London, accompanyed with all his forces.</p>
            <p>There were in that Armie the Marquesse of Northampton, (who of late had the Gouernement of the Warres against the<note place="margin">Warwicks Army 14000.</note> Campe) <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> Warwicks sonnes, <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby Poijsi, Bray,</hi> and many other noble and famous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes, besides of Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen: of the Switsers, and of all kinde of common Souldiers, about foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thousand. When they came to Cambridge, some of the Aldermen of the Citie of Norwich, and other of the Citizens met with Warwick at the Townes end. Which Citizens (as we said before) being afraid and astonished at the fearefull and mad boldnesse of the Conspirators, had fled the City. These pale and forlorne, and falling vpon their knees, cast themselues euery one at his feet, and with weeping, &amp; lamentable voice, beganne earnestly to intreat him, that he would lay no grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous thing to their charge; for they were innocent persons, and guiltie of no crime. Yet they besought the mercy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour<note place="margin">Citizens suit to War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.</note> of the Prince: For they had verily conceiued an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble griefe of this miserable destruction, and spoile of their Countrey, and had further indured all extremitie at the Rebels hands. In the end to prouide for their liues, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned to flye the City, and with sword and fire were cast out, not only from the City, but from their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and all their friends. In so great misery where with they were pressed on euery side; they craue nothing else, but if in this common and exceeding feare, through ignorance and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vnwittingly they haue wrapped themselues in any offence, the same might not be imputed vnto them, but vpon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and humble petition it might be pardoned.</p>
            <p>Hereunto Warwick answered that he perceiued how great<note place="margin">His answer.</note> perill they were in, and that without doubt the strength of those desperat men was great, which had driuen them from all these things as de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re vnto them as life it selfe: Affirming, that they had done nothing amisse to his knowledge. In that they had left the Citie in so great feare and danger, it was but the infirmitie of man, and to be borne withall. Notwithstanding in one thing they were somewhat ouer<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> seene, that they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb facs="tcp:3010:31"/>
not these euils in the very beginning: for a few valiant and wise men might haue dispatched those companies in a moment, if while the matter was in the beginning, they had opposed themselues for the health of their Countrey. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he granted pardon at their request, and offered the Kings fauour to them all, willing them, when they haue furnished themselues with weapons, and with the furniture of Souldiers, to be in a readinesse to follow the Host, hauing La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<note place="margin">Laces fur distinction.</note> about their necks, to bee discerned from the rest. These things done after this manner, he departeth from Cambridge: And the tenth of the Kalends of September hee came with all his Armie to Intwood. Intwood is distant from Norwich<note place="margin">The 23. of August.</note> about two miles. There <hi>Thomas Gresham</hi> Knight had a faire and large house, where Warwick abode that day and the night following with his companie. All the men notwithstanding were armed and ready to the battell, if peraduenture the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie should rayse vp any tumult on the sudden; which surely beheld from the holes in the Walles and Towers what should be done. Warwick in the meane season, while (as is said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) hee made his abode with all his Armie at Intwood, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his Herald, which in the name of the King (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris) proclaymeth warre against the City and Citizens, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept forth with they set open the Gates, and admit the Kings power into the Citie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Kett,</hi> when he vnderstood that the Herald was come to the Gates, willed <hi>Augustine Steward</hi> the Maiors Deputie, and <hi>Robert Rugge,</hi> chiefe men of the Citie to goe vnto him, and inquire what hee demanded. These being let out at a back<note place="margin">Bras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neuerthelesse, this one thing was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto the rest, which increased the height of their calamity, griefe, and shame; because that fidelity which they ought<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and earnestly desired to performe to his Maiestie, they were not able to fulfill at this time, and iudg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:3010:32"/>
that liued in this age, wherein they were euer compelled, either to vndergoe the danger of their life, or the hazard of<note place="margin">Two great extremities</note> their dignitie. Notwithstanding, they hoped well of the Kings Maiestie, as those which had no wayes bound themselues in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny consent of these villanies, but had restrayned (as much as was in them) the rest of the Citizens, with great losse of their goods, and euer with an incredible danger of their liues. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, they most humbly besought this one thing of the Earle, that because there were in the City an innumerable company of <hi>Ketts</hi> Campe, vnarmed, poore, and naked, (who besides that through feare and conscience of their owne wickednesse were holden guilty: Moreouer, were weary of this cursed so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, as which had filled the very desire of working mischiefe with the sacietie of their furies) it would please him once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, to trie that which hath been often prooued in vaine: sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, that they greatly hoped (if at this time might be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them againe the hope of impunitie) it would come to passe, that forthwith they would lay downe their weapons, without slaughter and bloudshed. Which thing (if it might<note place="margin">A glory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding all Victory.</note> come to passe) would be an eternall memorie vnto posteritie, and a glory exceeding all victorie, if they might carry home peace, and their weapons vnstained with the bloud of ciuill dissention.</p>
            <p>The Herald presently departeth from the Maiors speech in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Warwicks Campe, declaring all things as hee had receiued. The Earle, vnto whom nothing was more precious (if by any meanes it could bee brought to passe) then that this flame so dangerous and dreadfull, might be quenched without slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and bloudshed, decreed himselfe also the aduice in this matter, that it should not be measured according to the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies they had committed, but according to the dignitie of the King, and the vtilitie of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>He feared moreouer lest the Gentlemen that were holden bound in the Castle, and other Prisons, euery day tossed, and turmoiled with the great waues of feare, at the length might<note place="margin">Roger Woodhouse vsed cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly.</note> be cruelly slaine of them. For many were threatned death e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery houre; and many, chiefly <hi>Roger Woodhouse,</hi> Knight, was
<pb facs="tcp:3010:32"/>
continually reuiled with contumelious speeches, vpon whom, without all doubt, they exercised the vnsatiable crueltie of their minds, vexing and abusing him. For these causes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it pleased him to prooue, whether now at the length, by the hope of pardon and impunity, they might be drawne from the errour of their mischiefe.</p>
            <p>To this end, the Herald was presently sent, with a Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who entring into the Citie, were met with fortie of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, marching two and two together (for they were Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) with great ioy and loud cries, from Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> Gates to the Bishops Palace. From thence the Trumpeter sounding his Trumpet, gaue a signe: whereat, when great routs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels came flocking by heapes vnto them from the hill: The Horsemen with a swift course ranne vnto them, commanding, that diuiding themselues, the one halfe should stand in ranke right ouer against the other in order. Which when they had presently done, the Herald with his Trumpeter, and two other of the principall of the Citie, going in the midst betweene the rankes of the Rebels, were receiued on euery side with great shouts and outcries. For euery one vncouering their heads, as it were with one mouth and consent all at once (for the most part) cried, <hi>God saue King Edward<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> God saue King Edward:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended therefore of the Herald, and chiefe of the Citie, and willed to keepe their order awhile, as they were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of late. The Herald, when in this sort hee had passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them two hundred and fiftie paces, at the length came vnto the top of the hill, hauing on his rich Coate of Armes, as solemne ensignes of his Office.

Others said, that pardon in appearance seemed good and liberall, but in truth would proue in the ende lamentable and deadly, as that which would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else; but Barrels filled with Ropes and Halters. And that painted coate distinct, and beautified with gold; not to bee En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of an Herald: but some peeces of Popish Coapes sewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Many things besides (in their pestilent madnesse, turbulent and headlong) raging, and furiously they laid vpon him, while euery one round about powred forth the bitternesse of their venome, in most cruell speeches, sauoring of death it selfe. Notwithstanding, the Herald goeth from thence with <hi>Kett,</hi> into another place, where hee proclaimeth the same thing to the rest of the people (for before, all could not heare for presse.)</p>
            <p>It happened before he had made an end of his speech, that an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious boy, putting downe his breeches, shewed his bare but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes, and did a filthy act: adding therunto more filthy words.

Which when the Traitours perceiued, there came twelue of the horsemen most furiously coursing out of the Wood, &amp; crying: <hi>O my companions, we are betrayed.

            </p>
            <p>When he had spoken these words, they were all scattered (and as it were stirred vp with a certaine rage) they fled asunder. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<pb facs="tcp:3010:34"/>
               <hi>Kett</hi> ioyned himselfe with the Herald, and minded to haue<note place="margin">Kett would haue spoken with War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke.</note> spoken with Warwicke, face to face: but now when they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most come to the bottome of Sturt hill, a mighty rout of Rebels fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him with cries, inquiring all at once whither hee went, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they were willing to vndergoe with him what fortune soeuer (though neuer so sharpe) and if he would needs goe any further, he should haue them his companions and partners, both in life and death. The Herald, when hee looked behinde him, and saw such a company of men following, willed <hi>Kett</hi> to goe backe againe, and and stay this concourse, and tumult: who being returned to his Company, they were presently quiet, and went backe all of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into the Campe.</p>
            <p>But the Earle of Warwicke, when hee perceiued that they were all carried headlong (with a certaine frenzy, and as it were, a blinde rage of the minde) to destruction: and that neither by intreaty or faire promises; nor yet by the feare of punishment, they could bee wonne to cease from their filthy enterprize: It seemed best vnto him, to leaue off for euer the hope of peace: a thing aswell by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as by others often proued in vaine, and now at the length to deale by open warre. Therefore, he leadeth his army to Saint <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> gates, which the enemies had shut vp, letting downe the Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullis, and he commanded the Kings master Gunner, to place the Ordinance before the gates, that being throwne downe and batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, way might be made for the souldiers to enter the City. Which while they were about to doe, the Earle had knowledge from <hi>Augustine Steward,</hi> the Maiors Deputy: that there was a gate not farre off, which the common people call Brazen doore. This the enemy had made fast with great beames, and peeces of timber, and rampired vp with stones and earth; notwithstanding, with no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour might easily be shaken, and broken downe. The Pyoners are sought for; &amp; Commandement giuen to breake vp the gates, which broke open, there they first entred the City, and killing many, they easily remoue the enemy from that place. And now the Master Gunner had shottred and broken the Port-cullis at Saint <hi>Stephens</hi> gates, and ouerthrowne the one halfe of the gates, being shaken with the often shot. Where the Earle of Northampton, &amp; one <hi>Drury</hi> (a man of excellent valour) with their Bands hasting into the City, driue the Campers from thence, many being wounded, and many slaine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3010:35"/>Also on the other sides of the City, the Maiors Deputy brought<note place="margin">S.

There<note place="margin">60. Rebels hanged.</note> they found almost threescore of the Rebels, whom in warlike man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they punished. For without hearing the cause, all of them were presently (as the manner of warres is) manifestly conuict of their wickednesse, and receiued their last punishment. Not long after, all Carts and carriages, which could not come in, both by reason of the hardnesse of the draft; as also the often, and sodaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s of the enemies, are brought into the City at these gates also. But it came to passe (as it chanced) by the rashnesse and folly of the keepers of the carriage (while our men were occupied about their weighty businesse) that they went out of the City thorow Bishops gates, towards Moushold; which certaine of the Rebels perceiuing, they sent some of their company to set vpon the carelesse keepers<note place="margin">The K. car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage taken by Rebels.</note> thereof, and bereaued our men of the whole carriage. Whereat greatly reioycing (for before they were vtterly vnprouided of such things) they carryed into the Campe, Carts loaden with Gunnes, Gunpowder, and all kinde of instruments of warre.</p>
            <p>But in very good season, Captaine <hi>Drury</hi> came vpon them<note place="margin">Captaine Drury.</note> with his Band, which recouered part of the carriage from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: yet not without some losse of his Souldiers. Then the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours tooke this counsell to lay waite in the Lanes, and crosse Streets by Companies, supposing to stay our men quickly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, being ignorant of the wayes, not accustomed thereto, and by reason of the greatnesse of the City. Wherefore, they diuided themselues by Parishes. Some of them stood at Saint <hi>Michaels</hi> of Mospoole, part at Saint <hi>Simons,</hi> others at Saint <hi>Peters</hi> of Hungate, and others in East Wymer Warde; all ready to battell.

When they came thorow the Street (called Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Street, and were now come to Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> Church, the enemy (vnlooked for) with his Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men discharged vpon vs a mighty force of Arrowes, as flakes of snow in a tempest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3010:35"/>But while they were yet shooting, intending to mixe heauen and earth together: On the sudden came Captayne <hi>Drury</hi> the second time with his charge of Harquebusiers, yong men, and of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent courage and skill, who payed them home againe with such a terrible volly of shot (as if it had beene a storme of hayle) and put<note place="margin">Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels slaine at S.

               </note> them all to flight as in a moment, trembling. There were slaine at this skirmish about three hundred &amp; thirty. And many being found creeping in the Church-yard, and vnder the Walles, were taken and put to grieuous punishment. All the rest of that filthy company flowed againe to the Campe at Moushold, as into a sinke. Which being auoyded, the Citizens seemed at the length to be greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued and comforted, because they had vomited vp and cast out so grieuous a plague. The Rebels after this sort chased out, and driuen from the City: Warwick, the better to fortifie the same, furnished the walles with Souldiers, and other prouision, fit for the repulsing of the Enemie, and gaue commandement, that armed men (out of hand) should be placed in euery street, and that all the passages into the City and Gates (one or two excepted) should bee blocked vp. For by those Gates our men carryed out great store of Ordinance, which stood there ready charged to bee conueyed the next day to Moushold. But <hi>Ketts</hi> company supposing our men to bee greatly distressed for powder, &amp; all other necessary furniture for Ordinance, perceiuing also some few to stand straggling with our Carryage and Carts, &amp; not carefull for any sudden euent of warre (whom through the rage of the swelling pride of their heart, being mad) they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly despised (both because of their small company, as also being neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and fearing no such danger, they supposed they might easily ouer-come) they thought there was offered vnto them great opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of doing some notable exploit.</p>
            <p>Therefore, while Warwicks Souldiers (what for the defence of the City, and the number of other waighty businesse) were hindred with greater cares: One <hi>Myles,</hi> a man (as it seemeth) most bold,<note place="margin">Myles killed the Kings Gunner.</note> and skilfull in discharging of Ordinance, watching the time and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of this villany, shot thorow the Kings Master Gunner with a bullet.

<pb facs="tcp:3010:36"/>
force of the enemie vnlooked for) but astonished and terrified with the disordered cries, and horrible noise of their feete, as they came running downe the hill, leauing all the Baggage and Carts, ranne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way on all sides, with great out-cries, and a swift course. A few therefore after this sort put to flight by many, the Rebels tooke, and carried away into the Campe, certaine Ordinance which they found there, and Carts loaden with all things necessarie for the warres, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">The Rebels tooke the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision the second time</note> any helpe of our men could come. Which thing was very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs, and much out of our way. For besides that, afterward we wanted those instruments and weapons, wherewith the enemie had furnished himselfe, <hi>Ketts</hi> Gunners discharged often vpon vs, and most cruelly those iron bullets from the Ordinance and Gunnes which they tooke from vs, and battered the Citie grieuously. And many being slaine, torne and rent in sunder with the rage of the shot, this villany and wickednesse they adde to the rest; that they beate downe most furiously a great part of the Wall, and the Tower vpon Bishops Gates; though surely (through the goodnesse of God) such was the lot of the people of Norwich at that time, as the bullets flying euery where, whether by chance, or of set pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; or which rather I suppose, by the rashnesse and ignorance of the Gunners, which sometime happeneth, leuelling somewhat too high, mounted ouer the toppes of the houses, without doing any great harme: which, except it had so come to passe, with the continuall force of shot from those vile and wretched Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; the houses being shattered and shaken, the greatest part of the Citie had beene beaten downe, and made euen with the ground in short time: And without doubt, in the opinion of all men, a greater losse that day had come vnto all common affaires, except <hi>Drury</hi> with his valour, and slaughter of his<note place="margin">Drury satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience</note> souldiers, not to bee despised (making satisfaction for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience, by putting the enemies to flight, and chasing them,) had recouered the greatest part of the prouision they droue away.</p>
            <p>Warwicke, (these things done after this manner, some of<note place="margin">Warwicke fortifies the Citie.</note> the Gates of the Citie being broken and fallen downe, and now ramperd vp againe) placed vpon the Bridges, and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Streetes of the Parishes and Lanes, diuers of his Garisons, and appointed a great companie of Armed men at Bishops Gates, and committed the charge thereof to my Lord

               <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and so compassed and fortifyed all places, as the same night hee cut off from the Enemy all entrance into the Citie.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, the next day the Rebels came ouer the Riuer, called Contsford, and confounded all things with a terrible fire,<note place="margin">Rebels come ouer at Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tsford and fire the City.</note> and lamentable to behold. For all the houses in two Parishes being burnt downe; the fire so spred abroad, as it got hold with an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible flame vpon many of the Neighbour Parishes. There was a certayne house wherein the Marchants of Norwich did vsually bestow their marchandize, which they receiued daily from Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth (called the common Stathe.) Hereunto the Rebels set fire,<note place="margin">Common Stath burnt</note> whereby within a moment the house it selfe, and great store of Corne, and much other commodities of many honest Marchants, were vtterly burnt with fire and consumed. The report goeth (and it is not vnlikely) that they intended to haue destroyed the whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with fire, and to that end threw fire vpon the roofes of many houses, whereby they might bring to passe, that while all men should runne to saue the fired houses, the Rebels at the same instant,<note place="margin">Rebels po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</note> casting downe the Rampires, and opening all the Gates, might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse our men (being scattered, and helping one another) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the fire on the one side, and the sword on the other. Which thing being wisely obserued, both disappointed the deuice of the Rebels, and brought our men in the minde, to suffer the fire (sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euery where vpon the tops of the houses) with a speedy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, and consuming of all things, neither would they so much as quench it in the very beginning.</p>
            <p>But when in this sort vnhappily these things (for the most part)<note place="margin">Better a mischiefe, then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>uenience.</note> befell the Citizens; God bringing alwayes one calamity on the neck of another, great astonishment and sorrow strooke many mens mindes, in somuch as languishing through despaire and feare, they almost faynted, now deuoide of all counsell. These came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Warwick, declaring vnto him, that the City is great, and all the Gates either broke open, or burnt downe; the number of men for the warre but few, the power of the Enemie to be great, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be resisted. They humbly besought him, in regard of their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,<note place="margin">The coward linesse of the Citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s.</note> he would leaue the Citie, &amp; not suffer the matter to be brought to vtter extremity. Warwick (as hee was a man alwayes of a great and inuincible courage, valiant, and mighty in Armes, and thought scorne of the least infamie) said, What, are ye so
<pb facs="tcp:3010:37"/>
soone dismaid? and is so great a mist on the sudden come ouer your mindes, which hath taken away the edge of your courage, that you would either desire this thing, or thinke it can come to passe while I am aliue, that I should forsake the City? I will first suffer fire, sword; finally, all extremity, before I will bring such a stayne of infamy and shame, either vpon my selfe, or you. With these words hee drew his sword; so did the rest of the Nobles (for they were all there gathered together) and hee commanded after a warlike manner (and as is vsually done in greatest danger) that they should kisse one anothers sword, making the signe of the holy Crosse, and<note place="margin">Souldiers kisse one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others swords.</note> by an Oath, and solemne promise by word of mouth, euery man to binde himselfe to other, not to depart from the City, before they had vtterly banished the Enemie, or else fighting manfully, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed their liues cheerfully for the Kings Maiestie.</p>
            <p>While these things were in doing, the Rebels broke in at another side of the City, where our men little thought they could enter: but when they were almost come to the Bridges, they were speedily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by our men, and with a mighty slaughter and many wounds were driuen back againe, and retyred headlong the way they came.</p>
            <p>But Warwick, the better to take vtterly away from the Rebels all ability of entrance into the City, commanded all the Bridges on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery side to bee cut on sunder, yet after, for certayne causes it was commanded otherwise; and only that which is commonly called white Fryers bridge, was broken downe. All the rest were defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">White Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers bridge broken.</note> with good Souldiers. And al places else, and especially the gates (because for the most part they were all, either broken downe, or else fired) were deliuered in charge to men of courage, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in warlike affaires, to bee defended vpon euery sudden oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, whereby it came to passe, that al the desperate and night in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions of the Enemie, were voide and of none effect.</p>
            <p>The next day after, which was the seuenth of the Kalends of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,<note place="margin">The 26. of August. 1040. Switsers sent to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</note> one thousand and forty Switsers, valiant and notable Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers (as the report goeth commonly) came from London to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich. These were ioyfully receiued of our men<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> who testified their gladnesse and cheerfulnesse by many vollies of shot. At the length being diuided by Parishes and houses, and liberally &amp; courteously intertayned, and inuited of the Citizens, as it reuiued the hearts of our men, and stirred them vp vnto a sure hope, with confidence of
<pb facs="tcp:3010:37"/>
performing the businesse well: So it danted the hearts of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being now confounded with a new feare and astonishment, at this doubtfull knowledge of their future ouerthrow.</p>
            <p>In the meane season, the seditious, coueting nothing more then to sucke out the bloud of all good men (whereof they had now drunke in their most greedy mindes some hope) thought all the waight of the matter to consist in this, if Warwicks Army might be put to flight at the first assault. And surely as they forsooke the good and mighty God: so againe, being despised and reiected of him, they gaue ouer themselues bond-slaues to the Deuill: Who bewitching their mindes with an old wifes superstition, brought to passe, that being once intangled with the blinde illusions of Southsayers, they chose a certayne Vally, not farre off, as appointed to this warre by destinie: Although surely (as is recorded) there wanted not strange and euident tokens of Gods heauy displeasure against them.

But here peraduenture it will not be impertinent to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how these men puffed vp with the opinion of an idle error, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themselues to pestilent things. Which, when surely they por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the anger and vengeance of God (as it seemed) yet swelling with raging cruelty and obstinacy, they all neglected. So great a mist of darknesse vndoubtedly is Satan wont to bring vpon the mindes of men, as oft as he findeth them drowned in mischiefe. For while there were many doting Prophecies among the People, out of which they sucked I know not what hope of victorie; yet they imbraced certayne vnsauo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This answere being returned, Warwicke is reported to lament the multitude<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> euen now ready to perish. And<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> being led with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards them, sent againe to inquire: whether if hee came himselfe, and gaue his faith, and bound themselues before their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they would then lay downe their weapons.

            <p>Whereupon without delay, Warwicke goeth presently vnto them, commandeth the Herald openly to reade the Kings Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which being read (because therein vndoubtedly, pardon was

promised to all) trusting to it, they laid downe their weapons eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, and all of them as with one mouth, thankefully cryed: <hi>God save King Edward, God save King Edward.</hi> And thus many men (as it were taken out of the iawes of death) were saued by the Wisdome and Compassion of Warwicke.</p>
            <p>The battell being ended, all the prey the same day was giuen to the Souldiers, and openly sold in Norwich market. Moreouer, this thing is in Record, that many Gentlemen, and some of the chiefe of the City, were slaine in this tumult, and heat of the fight: although they gaue money, and great rewards to the Souldiers, to spare their liues.</p>
            <p>The next day, tidings was brought by certaine messengers to<note place="margin">Kett taken.</note> Warwicke, that <hi>Kett</hi> while his Horse tyred, and fell downe in his iourney (as it came to passe by Gods prouidence) being weary of his flight; hid himselfe in a Barne, &amp; was found by two seruants of one <hi>Riches</hi> of Swannington, &amp; taken and carried home to his house, and kept safe.

But these wilde and rude heads, after this sort being taken away, many of the Gentlemen carryed with displeasure and desire of reuenge, laboured to stirre vp the minde of Warwick to cruelty. Who not contented with the punishment of a few, would haue rooted out vtterly the off-spring and wicked race of them, and were so earnest and eger in it, as they constrayned War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick to vse this speech vnto them openly.</p>
