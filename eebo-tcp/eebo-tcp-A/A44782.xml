            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ADVICE
TO A

                  <opener>
                     <salute>Dear Daughter,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Find, that even our moſt pleaſing
Thoughts <hi>will</hi> be unquiet; they <hi>will</hi>
be in motion; and the <hi>Mind</hi> can have
no reſt whilſt it is poſſeſs'd by a dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Paſſion. <hi>You</hi> are at preſent the chief
Object of my <hi>Care,</hi> as well as of my
<hi>Kindneſs,</hi> which ſometimes throweth me
into <hi>Viſions</hi> of your being happy in the
World, that are better ſuited to my partial
<hi>Wiſhes,</hi> than, to my reaſonable <hi>Hopes</hi> for
you. At other times, when my <hi>Fears</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52156:14"/>
I ſhrink as if I was ſtruck, at the
Proſpect of <hi>Danger,</hi> to which a young
Woman muſt be expos'd. By how much
the more <hi>Lively,</hi> ſo much the more <hi>Lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
you are to be hurt; as the fineſt
Plants are the ſooneſt nipped by the <hi>Froſt.</hi>
Whilſt you are playing full of Innocence,
the ſpitefull World will bite, except you
are guarded by your <hi>Caution.</hi> Want of
<hi>Care</hi> therefore, my dear Child, is never
to be excus'd; ſince, as to <hi>this</hi> World, it
hath the ſame effect as want of <hi>Vertue.</hi>
Such an early ſprouting Wit requireth ſo
much the more to be ſheltred by ſome
<hi>Rules,</hi> like ſomething ſtrew'd on tender
Flowers to preſerve them from being blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
You muſt take it well to be prun'd
by ſo kind a Hand as that of a <hi>Father.</hi>
There may be ſome bitterneſs in meer
Obedience: The natural Love of <hi>Liberty</hi>
may help to make the Commands of a
Parent harder to go down: Some inward
reſiſtance there will be, where <hi>Power</hi> and
not <hi>Choice</hi> maketh us move. But when
a <hi>Father</hi> layeth aſide his Authority, and
perſuadeth only by his Kindneſs, you will
never anſwer it to Good Nature, if it hath
not weight with you.</p>
                  <p>A great part of what is ſaid in the
following <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> may be above the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52156:14"/>
growth of your Underſtanding; but
that becoming every day taller, will in
a little time reach up to it, ſo as to
make it eaſie to you. I am willing to
begin with you before your <hi>Mind</hi> is quite
form'd, that being the time in which it
is moſt capable of receiving a <hi>Colour</hi> that
will laſt when it is mix'd with it. Few
things are well learnt, but by early <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts:</hi>
Thoſe well infus'd, make them <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural;</hi>
and we are never ſure of retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is valuable, till by a continued
<hi>Habit</hi> we have made it a Piece of us.</p>
                  <p>Whether my skill can draw the Picture
of a fine Woman, may be a queſtion:
but it can be none, That I have drawn
that of a kind <hi>Father:</hi> If you will take
an exact Copy, I will ſo far preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my workmanſhip, as to undertake you
ſhall not make an ill <hi>Figure.</hi> Give me
ſo much Credit as to try, and I am ſure
that neither your Wiſhes nor mine ſhall
be diſappointed by it.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>RELIGION.</head>
                     <p>THe firſt thing to be confidered, is
<hi>Religion.</hi> It muſt be the chief Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of your Thoughts, ſince it would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52156:15"/>
be a vain thing to direct your <hi>Behaviour</hi>
in the World, and forget that which you
are to have towards him who made it.</p>
                     <p>In a ſtrict ſenſe, it is the only thing
neceſſary: you muſt take it into your
<hi>Mind,</hi> and from thence throw it into
your <hi>Heart,</hi> where you are to embrace
it ſo cloſe as never to loſe the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of
it. But then it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh
between the <hi>Reality</hi> and the <hi>Pretence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Religion</hi> doth not conſiſt in believing
the Legend of the <hi>Nurſery,</hi> where Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with their <hi>Milk</hi> are fed with the
Tales of Witches, Hobgoblings, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and Miracles. We ſuck in ſo gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
theſe early <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> that our riper
<hi>Vnderſtanding</hi> hath much ado to cleanſe
our <hi>Minds</hi> from this kind of <hi>Traſh:</hi> The
Stories are ſo entertaining, that we do
not only believe them, but relate them;
which makes the diſcovery of the <hi>Truth</hi>
ſomewhat grievous, when it makes us loſe
ſuch a Field of Impertinence, where we
might have diverted our ſelves, beſides
the throwing ſome ſhame upon us for
having ever received them. This is mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>World</hi> a <hi>Jeſt,</hi> and imputing to
God Almighty, That the Province he
aſſigneth to the Devil, is to play at Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans-buſf,
and ſhew Tricks with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52156:15"/>
and is ſo far from being <hi>Religion,</hi>
that it is not <hi>Senſe,</hi> and hath right only
to be call'd that kind of Devotion, of
which <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the undoubted <hi>Mother,</hi>
without competition or diſpute. Theſe
Miſtakes are therefore to be left off with
your Hanging ſleeves; and you ought to
be as much out of countenance to be
found with them about you, as to be
ſeen playing with Babies at an <hi>Age</hi> when
other things are expected from you.</p>
                     <p>The next thing to be obſerv'd to you,
is, That <hi>Religion</hi> doth as little conſiſt in
loud Anſwers and devout Convulſions at
Church, or Praying in an extraordinary
manner. Some Ladies are ſo extream ſtirr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Church,</hi> that one would ſwear the
<hi>Worm</hi> in their <hi>Conſcience</hi> made them ſo
unquiet. Others will have ſuch a Divided
Face between a <hi>Devout Goggle</hi> and an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting
Glance,</hi> that the unnatural Mixture
maketh even the <hi>beſt Looks</hi> to be at that
time <hi>ridiculous.</hi> Theſe affected <hi>Appearances</hi>
are ever ſuſpected, like very ſtrong Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes,
which are generally thought no
very good Symptoms in thoſe that make uſe
of them. Let your earneſtneſs therefore
be reſerv'd for your <hi>Cloſet,</hi> where you may
have God Almighty to your ſelf: In <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
be ſtill and calm, neither undecent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52156:16"/>
                        <hi>Careleſs,</hi> nor <hi>Affected</hi> in the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream.</p>
                     <p>It is not true Devotion, to put on
an angry <hi>Zeal</hi> againſt thoſe who may be
of a differing Perſuaſion. <hi>Partiality</hi> to our
ſelves makes us often miſtake it for a <hi>Duty,</hi>
to fall hard upon others in that caſe;
and being puſh'd on by <hi>Self-conceit,</hi> we
ſtrike without mercy, believing that the
<hi>Wounds</hi> we give are <hi>Meritorious,</hi> and that
we are fighting God Almighty's Quarrel;
when the truth is, we are only ſetting
out our ſelves. Our <hi>Devotion</hi> too often
breaketh out into that <hi>Shape</hi> which moſt
agreeth with our particular <hi>Temper.</hi> The
<hi>Cholerick</hi> grow into a hardned Severity
againſt all who diſſent from them; ſnatch
at all the Texts of Scripture that ſuit
with their <hi>Complexion;</hi> and becauſe God's
Wrath was ſome time kindled, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That <hi>Anger</hi> is a Divine Vertue;
and are ſo far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rom imagining their ill
natur'd <hi>Zeal</hi> requireth an <hi>Apology,</hi> that they
value themſelves upon it, and triumph in
it. <hi>Others,</hi> whoſe Nature is more Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
than ordinary, admit no Bounds or
Meaſure to it; they grow as proud of
extending their <hi>Faith,</hi> as Princes are of
enlarging their <hi>Dominions;</hi> not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that our <hi>Faith,</hi> like our Stomach, is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52156:16"/>
capable of being over-charg'd; and that
as the laſt is deſtroy'd by taking in more
than it can digeſt, ſo our <hi>Reaſon</hi> may be
extinguiſh'd by oppreſſing it with the
weight of too many ſtrange things; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if we are forbidden to chew what
we are commanded to ſwallow. The <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy</hi>
and the <hi>Sullen</hi> are apt to place a
great part of their <hi>Religion</hi> in dejected
or ill-humour'd <hi>Looks,</hi> putting on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable
Face, and declaiming againſt the
Innocent Entertainments of <hi>Life,</hi> with as
much ſharpneſs as they could beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the greateſt <hi>Crimes.</hi> This generally is
only a <hi>Vizard,</hi> there is ſeldom any thing
real in it. No other thing is the better
for being <hi>Sowre;</hi> and it would be hard
that <hi>Religion</hi> ſhould be ſo, which is the
beſt of things. In the mean time it may
be ſaid with truth, That this <hi>ſurly</hi> kind of
<hi>Devotion</hi> hath perhaps done little leſs hurt
in the World, by frighting, than the moſt
ſcandalous <hi>Examples</hi> have done by infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
                     <p>Having told you, in theſe few Inſtances,
to which many more might be added,
what is not true <hi>Religion;</hi> it is time to
deſcribe to you, what is ſo. The ordinary
<hi>Definitions</hi> of it are no more like it, than
the common Sign-poſts are like the Princes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52156:17"/>
they would repreſent. The unskilful <hi>Daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
in all Ages have generally laid on
ſuch ill <hi>Colours,</hi> and drawn ſuch harſh <hi>Lines,</hi>
that the Beauty of it is not eaſily to be
diſcerned: They have put in all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddng
Features that can be thought of;
and in the firſt place, have made it an
irreconcilable Enemy to <hi>Nature;</hi> when,
in reality, they are not only <hi>Friends,</hi> but
<hi>Twins,</hi> born together at the ſame time;
and it is doing violence to them both,
to go about to have them ſeparated.
Nothing is ſo kind and ſo inviting as
true and <hi>unſophiſticated Religion:</hi> Inſtead
of impoſing unneceſſary Burdens upon our
<hi>Nature,</hi> it eaſeth us of the greater weight
of our <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Miſtakes:</hi> Inſtead of
ſubduing us with <hi>Rigour,</hi> it redeemeth us
from the <hi>Slavery</hi> we are in to our ſelves,
who are the moſt ſevere Maſters, whilſt
we are under the Uſurpation of our <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites</hi>
let looſe and not reſtrain'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Religion</hi> is a chearful thing, ſo far from
being always at <hi>Cuffs</hi> with <hi>Good Humour,</hi>
that it is inſeparably united to it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
unpleaſant belongs to it, though the
<hi>Spiritual Cooks</hi> have done their unskilful
part to give an ill <hi>Reliſh</hi> to it. A wiſe
<hi>Epicure</hi> would be <hi>Religious</hi> for the ſake of
<hi>Pleaſure;</hi> Good Senſe is the Foundation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52156:17"/>
of both; and he is a <hi>Bungler</hi> who aimeth
at true <hi>Luxury,</hi> but where they are join'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Religion</hi> is exalted <hi>Reaſon,</hi> refin'd and
ſiſted from the groſſer parts of it: It
dwelleth in the upper Region of the <hi>Mind,</hi>
where there are feweſt <hi>Clouds</hi> or <hi>Miſts</hi> to
darken or offend it: It is both the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and the Crown of all Vertues: It
is <hi>Morality</hi> improv'd and rais'd to its
height, by being carried nearer <hi>Heaven,</hi>
the only place where <hi>Perfection</hi> reſideth.
It cleanſeth the <hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> and bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
off the Earth that hangeth about our
<hi>Souls.</hi> It doth not want the <hi>Hopes</hi> and
the <hi>Terrors</hi> which are made uſe of to
ſupport it; neither ought it to deſcend
to the borrowing any Argument out of it
ſelf, ſince there we may find every thing
that ſhould invite us. If we were to be
hired to <hi>Religion,</hi> it is able to out-bid the
corrupted World, with all it can offer to
us, being ſo much the <hi>Richer</hi> of the two,
in every thing where <hi>Reaſon</hi> is admitted to
be a Judge of the Value.</p>
                     <p>Since this is ſo, it is worth your pains
to make <hi>Religion</hi> your choice, and not
make uſe of it only as a <hi>Refuge.</hi> There
are Ladies, who finding by the too viſible
decay of their good Looks, that they can
ſhine no more by that <hi>Light,</hi> put on the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52156:18"/>
                        <hi>Varniſh</hi> of an affected Devotion, to keep
up ſome kind of Figure in the World.
They take Sanctuary in the <hi>Church,</hi> when
they are purſued by growing <hi>Contempt</hi>
which will not be ſtopt, but followeth
them to the <hi>Altar.</hi> Such late penitence
is only a diſguiſe for the tormenting grief
of being no more handſome. That is the
killing thought which draweth the ſighs
and tears, that appear outwardly to be
applied to a better end.</p>
                     <p>There are many who have an <hi>Aguiſh
Devotion,</hi> Hot and Cold Fits, long Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions,
and violent Raptures. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evenneſs
is by all means to be avoided.
Let your method be a ſteady courſe of
good <hi>Life,</hi> that may run like a ſmooth
Stream, and be a perpetual Spring to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
to the continued <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>Vertue.</hi>
Your <hi>Devotion</hi> may be earneſt, but it muſt
be unconſtrained; and like other Duties,
you muſt make it your <hi>Pleaſure</hi> too, or
elſe it will have very little efficacy. By
this <hi>Rule</hi> you may beſt judge of your
own Heart. Whilſt thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> are <hi>Joys,</hi>
it is an Evidence of their being ſincere;
but when they are a <hi>Penance,</hi> it is a ſign
that your <hi>Nature</hi> maketh ſome reſiſtance;
and whilſt that laſteth, you can never
be entirely ſecure of your ſelf.</p>

If you are often unquiet, and too nearly
touch'd by the croſs Accidents of <hi>Life,</hi>
your <hi>Devotion</hi> is not of the right <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi>
there is too much <hi>Allay</hi> in it. That
which is right and unmixt, taketh away
the <hi>Sting</hi> of every thing that would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you: It is like a healing <hi>Balm,</hi> that
extinguiſheth the ſharpneſs of the Bloud;
ſo this ſofteneth and diſſolveth the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi>
of the <hi>Mind.</hi> A devout <hi>Mind</hi> hath
the Privilege of being free from <hi>Paſſions,</hi>
as ſome Climates are from all venomous
kind of Creatures. It will raiſe you above
the little <hi>Vexations</hi> to which others for
want of it, will be expos'd, and bring you
to a <hi>Temper,</hi> not of ſtupid <hi>Indifference,</hi>
but of ſuch a wiſe <hi>Reſignation,</hi> that you
may live in the <hi>World,</hi> ſo as it may hang
about you like a looſe Garment, and not
tied too cloſe to you.</p>
                     <p>Take heed of running into that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Error,</hi> of applying God's Judgments
upon particular Occaſions. Our Weights and
Meaſures are not competent to make the
Diſtribution either of his <hi>Mercy</hi> or his
<hi>Juſtice:</hi> He hath thrown a Veil over theſe
things, which makes it not only an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence,</hi>
but a kind of <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> for
us to give Sentence in them without his
<hi>Commiſſion.</hi>

As to your particular <hi>Faith,</hi> keep to the
<hi>Religion</hi> that is grown up with you, both
as it is the bed in it ſelf, and that the reaſon
of ſtaying in it upon that Ground is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſtronger for your <hi>Sex,</hi> than it will
perhaps be allow'd to be for ours; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
that the Voluminous enquiries into
the <hi>Truth,</hi> by Reading, are leſs expected
from you. The <hi>Beſt</hi> of <hi>Books</hi> will be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

whilſt you are fix'd and ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd

                     <p>Let me recommend to you a Method of

                     <p>THAT which challengeth the place
in your Thoughts, is how to live with
a <hi>Husband.</hi> And though that is ſo large a

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52156:19"/>
are unchangeable, the <hi>Methods</hi> being as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as the ſeveral <hi>Tempers</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> to which
they muſt be ſuited; yet I cannot omit
ſome <hi>General Obſervations,</hi> which, with the
help of your own may the better direct you
in the part of your Life upon which your
<hi>Happineſs</hi> moſt dependeth.</p>
                     <p>It is one of the <hi>Diſadvantages</hi> belonging
to your <hi>Sex,</hi> that young Women are ſeldom
permitted to make their own <hi>Choice;</hi> their
Friends Care and Experience are thought
ſafer Guides to them, than their own <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;</hi>
and their <hi>Modeſty</hi> often forbiddeth
them to refuſe when their Parents recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
though their <hi>inward Conſent</hi> may
not entirely go along with it. In this caſe
there remaineth nothing for them to do,
but to endeavour to make that eaſie which
falleth to their <hi>Lot,</hi> and by a wiſe uſe of
every thing they may diſlike in a <hi>Husband<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
turn that by degrees to be very ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which, if neglected, might in time
beget an <hi>Averſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You muſt firſt lay it down for a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That there is <hi>Inequality</hi>
in the <hi>Sexes,</hi> and that for the better Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of the World, the <hi>Men,</hi> who were
to be the Law-givers, had the larger ſhare
of <hi>Reaſon</hi> beſtow'd upon them; by which
means your <hi>Sex</hi> is the better prepar'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52156:20"/>
for the <hi>Compliance</hi> that is neceſſary for the
better performance of thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> which
teem to be moſt properly aſſign'd to it.
This looks a little uncourtly at the firſt
appearance; but upon Examination it will
be found, that <hi>Nature</hi> is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unjuſt to you, that ſhe is partial on
our ſide. She hath made you ſuch large
<hi>Amends</hi> by other Advantages, for the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Injuſtice</hi> of the firſt Diſtribution, that
the Right of Complaining is come over
to our Sex. You have it in your power
not only to free your ſelves, but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
your Maſters, and without violence
throw both their <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Legal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
at your Feet. We are made of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Tempers,</hi> that our <hi>Defects</hi> may the

your <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> to ſoften, and to entertain
us. The firſt part of our Life is a good
deal ſubjected to you in the <hi>Nurſery,</hi> where
you Reign without Competition, and by
that means have the advantage of giving
the firſt <hi>Impreſſions.</hi> Afterwards you have
ſtronger Influences, which, well manag'd,
have more force in your behalf, than all
our <hi>Privileges</hi> and <hi>Juriſdictions</hi> can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52156:20"/>
ſtrength in your <hi>Looks,</hi> than we have in
our <hi>Laws,</hi> and more power by your <hi>Tears,</hi>
than we have by our <hi>Arguments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Marriage,</hi>
run in a harſher ſtile towards your <hi>Sex.
Obey</hi> is an ungenteel word, and leſs eaſie
to be digeſted, by making ſuch an unkind
diſtinction in the Words of the Contract,
and ſo very unſuitable to the exceſs of <hi>Good
Manners,</hi> which generally goes before it.
Beſides, the <hi>univerſality</hi> of the Rule ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be a <hi>Grievance,</hi> and it appeareth
reaſonable, that there might be an <hi>Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for extraordinary Women, from ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Rules, to take away the juſt Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that lieth againſt the falſe meaſure
of <hi>general Equality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be alledged by the <hi>Counſel</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by your Sex, that as there is in
all other Laws, an Appeal from the <hi>Letter</hi>
to the <hi>Equity,</hi> in Caſes that require it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
It is as reaſonable, that ſome <hi>Court</hi> of a
larger. <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> might be erected, where
ſome <hi>Wives</hi> might reſort and plead <hi>ſpecially.</hi>
And in ſuch inſtances where Nature is
ſo kind, as to raiſe them above the <hi>level</hi>
of their own <hi>Sex,</hi> they might have <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi>
and obtain a <hi>Mitigation</hi> in their own
particular, of a <hi>Sentence</hi> which was given
generally againſt <hi>Woman kind.</hi> The cauſes
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52156:21"/>
of <hi>Separation</hi> are now ſo very courſe, that
few are <hi>confident</hi> enough to buy their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
at the price of having their Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
ſo expoſed. And for <hi>diſparity of Minds,</hi>
which above all other things requireth a
<hi>Remedy,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> have made no <hi>proviſion;</hi>
ſo little refin'd are numbers of Men, by
whom they are compil'd. This and a great
deal more might be ſaid to give a colour
to the Complaint.</p>
                     <p>But the Anſwer to it, in ſhort is, That
the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>Marriage</hi> is too ſacred
to admit a <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>objecting</hi> to it; That
the ſuppoſition of yours being the weaker
<hi>Sex,</hi> having without all doubt a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
maketh it reaſonable to ſubject it
to the <hi>Maſculine Dominion;</hi> That no <hi>Rule</hi>
can be ſo <hi>perfect,</hi> as not to admit ſome
<hi>Exceptions;</hi> But the Law preſumeth there
would be ſo few found in this Caſe, who
would have a ſufficient Right to ſuch a
Privilege, that it is ſafer ſome <hi>Injuſtice</hi> ſhould
be <hi>conniv'd</hi> at in a very few Inſtances, than
to break into an Eſtabliſhment, upon which
the Order of Humane Society doth ſo much
depend.</p>
                     <p>You are therefore to make your beſt of
what is <hi>ſettled</hi> by <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> and
not vainly imagine, that it will be <hi>changed</hi>
for your ſake. But that you may not be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52156:21"/>
diſcouraged, as if you lay under the weight
of an <hi>incurable Grievance,</hi> you are to know,
that by a <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>dexterous</hi> Conduct, it
will be in your power to <hi>relieve</hi> your ſelf
from any thing that looketh like a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in it. For your better direction,
I will give a hint of the moſt ordinary
<hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Diſſatisfaction</hi> between Man and
Wife, that you may be able by ſuch a <hi>Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to live ſo upon your <hi>Guard,</hi> that when
you ſhall be married, you may know how
to <hi>cure</hi> your Husband's <hi>Miſtakes,</hi> and to
<hi>prevent</hi> your own.</p>
                     <p>Firſt then, you are to conſider, you live
in a time which hath rendred ſome kind of
Frailties ſo habitual, that they lay claim to
large <hi>Grains</hi> of <hi>Allowance.</hi> The World in
this is ſomewhat unequal, and our Sex ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to play the <hi>Tyrant</hi> in diſtinguiſhing
<hi>partially</hi> for our ſelves, by making that in
the utmoſt degree <hi>Criminal</hi> in the <hi>Woman,</hi>
which in a <hi>Man</hi> paſſeth under a much <hi>gentler
Cenſure.</hi> The Root and the Excuſe of this
Injuſtice is the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of Families from
any <hi>Mixture</hi> which may bring a Blemiſh to
them: And whilſt the <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Honour</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to be ſo plac'd, it <hi>ſeems</hi> unavoidable
to give your <hi>Sex,</hi> the greater ſhare of the
Penalty. But if in this it lieth under any
<hi>Diſadvantage,</hi> you are more than recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52156:22"/>
by having the <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Families</hi>
in your keeping. The Conſideration ſo
great a Truſt muſt give you, maketh full
amends; and this Power the World hath
lodged in you, can hardly fail to reſtrain
the Severity of an <hi>ill</hi> Husband, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the Kindneſs and Eſteem of a <hi>good</hi>
one. This being ſo, remember, That next
to the danger, of <hi>committing</hi> the Fault your
ſelf, the greateſt is that of <hi>ſeeing</hi> it in your
<hi>Husband.</hi> Do not ſeem to look or hear that
way: If he is a Man of Senſe, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
himſelf; the Folly of it, is of it ſelf
ſufficient to cure him: if he is not ſo, he
will be provok'd, but not reform'd. To
expoſtulate in theſe Caſes, looketh like
declaring War, and preparing Repriſals;
which to a <hi>thinking Husband</hi> would be a
dangerous Reflexion. Beſides, it is ſo courſe
a Reaſon which will be aſſign'd for a Lady's
too great Warmth upon ſuch an occaſion,
that Modeſty no leſs than Prudence ought
to reſtrain her; ſince ſuch an undecent
Complaint makes a Wife much more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous,
than the Injury that provoketh her
to it. But it is yet worſe, and more unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
to <hi>blaze it</hi> in the World, expecting it
ſhould riſe up in Arms to take her part:
Whereas ſhe will find, it can have no other
Effect, than that ſhe will be ſerved up in all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52156:22"/>
Companies, as the <hi>reigning Jeſt</hi> at that time;
and will continue to be the common Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
till ſhe is reſcu'd by ſome <hi>newer
Folly</hi> that cometh upon the Stage, and
driveth her away from it. The Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
of ſuch Methods is ſo plain, that it
doth not deſerve the pains of being laid
open. Be aſſur'd, that in theſe Caſes your
<hi>Diſcretion</hi> and <hi>Silence</hi> will be the moſt <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Reproof.</hi> An <hi>affected Ignorance,</hi> which
is ſeldom a <hi>Vertue,</hi> is a great one here:
And when your <hi>Husband</hi> ſeeth how unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ng
you are to be uneaſie, there is no
ſtronger Argument to perſwade him not to
be unjuſt to you. Beſides, it will naturally
make him more <hi>yielding</hi> in other things:
And whether it be to <hi>cover</hi> or redeem his
<hi>Offence,</hi> you may have the good Effects of
it whilſt it laſteth, and all that while have
the moſt reaſonable Ground that can be, of
preſuming, ſuch a Behaviour will at laſt
entirely convert him. There is nothing ſo
glorious to a <hi>Wife,</hi> as a Victory ſo gain'd:
A Man ſo reclaim'd, is for ever after ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to her <hi>Vertue;</hi> and her <hi>bearing</hi> for a
time, is more than rewarded by a Triumph
that will continue as long as her Life.</p>
                     <p>The next thing I will ſuppoſe, is, That
your <hi>Husband</hi> may love <hi>Wine</hi> more than
is convenient. It will be granted, That
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52156:23"/>
though there are Vices of a deeper dye,
there are none that have greater <hi>Deformity</hi>
than this, when it is not reſtrain'd: But
with all this, the ſame Cuſtom which is the
more to be lamented for its being ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
ſhould make it leſs uneaſie to every
one in particular who is to ſuffer by the
Effects of it: So that in the firſt place,
it will be no new thing if you ſhould have
a <hi>Drunkard</hi> for your <hi>Husband;</hi> and there is
by too frequent Examples evidence enough,
that ſuch a thing may happen, and yet a
<hi>Wife</hi> may live too without being miſerable.
<hi>Self-love</hi> dictateth aggravating words to
every thing we feel; <hi>Ruine</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> are
the Terms we apply to whatever we do
not like, forgetting the Mixture allotted to
us by the Condition of Human Life, by
which it is not intended we ſhould be quite
exempt from trouble. It is fair, if we can
eſcape ſuch a degree of it as would oppreſs
us, and enjoy ſo much of the pleaſant part
as may leſſen the ill taſte of ſuch things as
are unwelcome to us. Every thing hath
two Sides, and for our own eaſe we ought
to direct our Thoughts to that which may
be leaſt liable to exception. To ſall upon
the <hi>worſt ſide</hi> of a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> giveth ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
a proſpect, that it is not poſſible
to dwell upon it. Let us paſs then to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52156:23"/>
more <hi>favourable part,</hi> as far as a <hi>Wife</hi> is
concern'd in it.</p>
                     <p>I am tempted to ſay (if the Irregularity
of the Expreſſion could in ſtrictneſs be
juſtified) That a <hi>Wife</hi> is to thank God her
<hi>Husband</hi> hath <hi>Faults.</hi> Mark the ſeeming
Paradox my Dear, for your own Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it being intended no further. A <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>
without <hi>Faults</hi> is a dangerous Obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
he hath an Eye ſo piercing, and ſeeth
every thing ſo plain, that it is expos'd to
his full Cenſure. And though I will not
doubt but that your <hi>Vertue</hi> will diſappoint
the ſharpeſt Enquiries; yet few Women
can bear the having all they ſay or do <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented</hi>
in the clear Glaſs of an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
without <hi>Faults.</hi> Nothing ſoftneth
the <hi>Arrogance</hi> of our <hi>Nature,</hi> like a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſome <hi>Frailties.</hi> It is by them we
are beſt told, that we muſt not ſtrike too
hard upon others, becauſe we our ſelves
do ſo often deſerve Blows: They pull our
Rage by the Sleeve, and whiſper Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to us in our Cenſures, even when
they are rightly applied. The <hi>Faults</hi> and
<hi>Paſſions</hi> of <hi>Husbands</hi> bring them down
to you, and make them content to live
upon leſs unequal Terms, than Faultleſs
Men would be willing to ſtoop to; ſo
haughty is Mankind till humbled by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52156:24"/>
Weakneſſes and Defects, which in
our corrupted State contribute more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the reconciling us to one another,
than all the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and
<hi>Divines.</hi> So that where the <hi>Errors</hi> of our
<hi>Nature</hi> make amends for the <hi>Diſadvantages</hi>
of yours it is more your part to make uſe
of the <hi>Benefit,</hi> than to quarrel at the
<hi>Fault.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus in caſe a <hi>Drunken Husband</hi> ſhould
fall to your ſhare, if you will be <hi>wiſe</hi> and
<hi>patient,</hi> his <hi>Wine</hi> ſhall be of your ſide; it
will throw a <hi>Veil</hi> over your Miſtakes, and
will ſet out and improve every thing you
do, that he is pleaſed with. Others will
like him leſs, and by that means he may
perhaps like you the more. When after
having dined too well, he is received at
home without a <hi>Storm,</hi> or ſo much as a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Look,</hi> the <hi>Wine</hi> will naturally
work out all in Kindeneſs, which a <hi>Wife</hi>
muſt encourage, let it be wrapped up in
never ſo much Impertinence. On the other
ſide it would boil up into <hi>Rage,</hi> if the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken
<hi>Wife</hi> ſhould treat him roughly, like
a certain thing called a <hi>kind Shrew,</hi> than
which the World, with all its Plenty, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſhew a more Senſeleſs, ill-bred, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Creature. Conſider, that where the
Man will give ſuch frequent Intermiſſions
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52156:24"/>
of the uſe of his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the <hi>Wife</hi> inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
getteth a Right of <hi>Governing</hi> in the
Vacancy, and that raiſeth her <hi>Character</hi> and
<hi>Credit</hi> in the Family, to a higher pitch
than perhaps could be done under a <hi>ſober
Husband,</hi> who never putteth himſelf into
an Incapacity of holding the <hi>Reins.</hi> If
theſe are not intire <hi>Conſolations,</hi> at leaſt they
are <hi>Remedies</hi> to ſome Degree. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> a <hi>Vertue,</hi> nor a <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi>
given to it a <hi>Felicity;</hi> but you will do
your ſelf no ill office in the endeavouring,
by theſe means, to make the beſt of ſuch
a <hi>Lot,</hi> in caſe it ſhould happen to be
yours, and by the help of a wiſe Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to make that very ſupportable, which
would otherwiſe be a <hi>Load</hi> that would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
you.</p>
                     <p>The next Caſe I will put is that your
<hi>Husband</hi> may be <hi>Cholerick</hi> or <hi>Ill-humour'd.</hi>
To this it may be ſaid, That <hi>paſſionate</hi>
Men generally make amends at the Foot
of the Account. Such a Man, if he is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
one day without any <hi>Senſe,</hi> will the
next day be as kind without any <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
So that by marking how the <hi>Wheels</hi> of ſuch
a Man's Head are uſed to move, you may

whom you ſhall think it beſt applied.
Thus are the <hi>ſtrongeſt Poiſons</hi> turn'd to the
<hi>beſt Remedies;</hi> but then there muſt be
<hi>Art</hi> in it, and a <hi>skilful Hand,</hi> elſe the leaſt
<hi>bungling</hi> maketh it mortal. There is a great
deal of nice Care requiſite to deal with a
Man of this Complexion. <hi>Choler</hi> proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from <hi>Pride,</hi> and maketh a Man ſo partial
to himſelf that he ſwelleth againſt Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
and thinketh he is leſſened if he
is oppoſed. You muſt in this Caſe take
heed of <hi>increaſing the Storm</hi> by an <hi>unwary
Word,</hi> or <hi>kindling the Fire</hi> whilſt the Wind
is in a Corner which may blow it in
your Face: You are dextrouſly to yield
every thing till he beginneth to cool, and
then by ſlow degrees you may riſe and gain
upon him: Your <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> well timed,
will, like a Charm, diſpel his Anger ill plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
a <hi>kind Smile</hi> will <hi>reclaim,</hi> when a <hi>ſhrill
pettiſh Anſwer</hi> would <hi>provoke</hi> him; rather
than fail upon ſuch occaſions, when other
<hi>Remedies</hi> are too weak, a little <hi>Flattery</hi>
may be admitted, which by being neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
will ceaſe to be Criminal.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Ill. Humour</hi> and <hi>Sullenneſs,</hi> and not open
and ſudden Heat is his Diſeaſe, there is a
way of treating that too, ſo as to make it
a Grievance to be endured. In order to
if, you are firſt to know, that naturally
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52156:25"/>
                        <hi>good Senſe</hi> hath a mixture of <hi>ſurly</hi> in it:
and there being ſo much <hi>Folly</hi> in the
World, and for the Moſt part ſo triumphant,
it giveth frequent Temptations to raiſe the
<hi>Spleen</hi> of Men who think right. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that which may generally be call'd
<hi>Ill-Humour,</hi> is not always a Fault; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
one when either it is wrong ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
or that it is continued too long,
when it is not ſo: For this Reaſon you
muſt not too haſtily fix an ill name upon
that which may perhaps not deſerve it;
and though the Caſe ſhould be, that your
<hi>Husband</hi> might too ſowerly reſent any
thing he diſliketh, it may ſo happen, that
more Blame ſhall belong to your <hi>Miſtake,</hi>
than to his <hi>Ill-Humour.</hi> If a <hi>Husband</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haveth
himſelf ſometimes with an <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
that a <hi>Wife</hi> may think offenſive, ſhe
is in the wrong to put the worſt ſence
upon it, if by any Means it will admit
a better. Some <hi>Wives</hi> will call it <hi>Ill-humour</hi>
if their Husbands change their <hi>Style</hi>
from that which they uſed whilſt they
made their firſt Addreſſes to them: Others
will allow no <hi>Intermiſſion</hi> or <hi>Abatement</hi> in
the Expreſſions of Kindneſs to them, not
enough diſtinguiſhing Times, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that it is impoſſible for Men to keep
themſelves up all their Lives to the height
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52156:26"/>
of ſome <hi>extravagant Moments.</hi> A Man
may at ſome times be leſs careful in little
things, without any cold or diſobliging
Reaſon for it; as a <hi>Wife</hi> may be too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
in ſmaller matters, without draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon her-ſelf the inference of being
<hi>unkind.</hi> And if your <hi>Husband</hi> ſhould be
really ſullen, and have ſuch frequent Fits,
as might take away the excuſe of it, it
concerneth you to have an Eye prepared
to diſcern the firſt Appearances of Cloudy
Weather, and to watch when the Fit go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
off, which ſeldom laſteth long if it is
let alone. But whilſt the Mind is ſore, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing galleth it, and that maketh it
neceſſary to let the <hi>Black Humour</hi> begin to
ſpend it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before you come in and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to undertake it.</p>
                     <p>If in the Lottery of the World you
ſhould draw a <hi>Covetous Husband,</hi> I confeſs
it will not make you proud of your <hi>good
Luck;</hi> yet even ſuch a one may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
too, though there are few Paſſions
more untractable than that of <hi>Avarice.</hi>
You muſt firſt take care that your <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Avarice</hi> may not be a Miſtake.
You are to examine every Circumſtance
of your <hi>Husband</hi>'s Fortune, and weigh
the Reaſon of every thing you expect
from him before you have right to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52156:26"/>
that ſentence. The Complaint is
now ſo general againſt all <hi>Husbands,</hi> that
it giveth great ſuſpicion of its being often
ill-grounded; it is impoſſible they ſhould
all deſerve that Cenſure, and therefore it
is certain, that it is many times miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.
He that <hi>ſpareth</hi> in every thing is
an <hi>inexcuſable Niggard;</hi> he that <hi>ſpareth</hi> in
nothing is as <hi>inexcuſable a Madman.</hi> The
<hi>mean</hi> is, to ſpare in what is leaſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
to lay out more liberally in what is
moſt required in our ſeveral circumſtances.
Yet this will not always ſatisfie. There
are <hi>Wives</hi> who are impatient of the Rules
of Oecomomy, and are apt to call their
<hi>Husband</hi>'s Kindneſs in queſtion, if any other
meaſure is put to their expence than that
of their own Fancy. Be ſure to avoid
this dangerous Error, ſuch a partiality to
your Self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is ſo offenſive to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
Man, that he will very ill bear
a <hi>Wife</hi>'s giving her ſelf ſuch an injurious
<hi>preference</hi> to all the <hi>Family,</hi> and whatever
belongeth to it.</p>
                     <p>But to admit the worſt, and that your
<hi>Husband</hi> is really a <hi>Cloſe-handed Wretch,</hi>
you muſt in this, as in other Caſes, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to make it leſs afflicting to you;
and firſt you muſt obſerve <hi>ſeaſonable hours</hi>
of ſpeaking. When you offer any thing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52156:27"/>
in oppoſition to this reigning Humour, a
<hi>third hand</hi> and a <hi>wiſe Friend,</hi> may often
prevail more than you will be allowed to
do in your own Cauſe. Sometimes you
are dexterouſly to go along with him in
things, where you ſee that the niggardly
part of his Mind is moſt predominant, by
which you will have the better opportunity
of perſwading him in things where he may
be more indifferent. Our <hi>Paſſions</hi> are very
unequal, and are apt to be raiſed or leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
according as they work upon different
Objects; they are not to be <hi>ſtopped</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained</hi>
in thoſe things where our Mind is
more particularly engaged. In other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they are more tractable, and will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
give Reaſon a hearing, and admit
a fair Diſpute. More than that, there are
few Men, even in this inſtance of <hi>Ava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ice,</hi>
ſo intirely abandoned to it, that at ſome
hours, and upon ſome occaſions, will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
their natures, and for that time turn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal.
The ſame Man who will <hi>grudge</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
what is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> let his <hi>Pride</hi> be raiſed
and he ſhall be <hi>profuſe;</hi> at another time
his <hi>Anger</hi> ſhall have the ſame effect; a fit
of <hi>Vanity, Ambition,</hi> and ſometimes of <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
ſhall open and inlarge his <hi>narrow Mind;</hi>
a Doſe of Wine will work upon this tough
humor, and for the time diſſolve it. Your
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52156:27"/>
buſneſs muſt be, if this Caſe happeneth,
to watch theſe <hi>critical moments,</hi> and not let
one of them ſlip without making your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of it; and a <hi>Wife</hi> may be ſaid
to want <hi>skill,</hi> if by theſe means ſhe is not
able to ſecure her ſelf in a good meaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Inconveniences this ſcurvy qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in a <hi>Husband</hi> might bring upon her,
except he ſhould be ſuch an incurable <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
as I hope will never fall to your
ſhare.</p>
                     <p>The laſt ſuppoſition I will make, is, That
your <hi>Husband</hi> ſhould be <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent</hi>
to make uſe of the Privileges that
belong to him. It will be yielded, that
ſuch a one leaveth room for a great many
Objections. But God Almighty ſeldom
ſendeth a <hi>Grievance</hi> without a <hi>Remedy,</hi> or
at leaſt ſuch a Mitigation as taketh away
a great part of the ſting, and the ſmart
of it. To make ſuch a <hi>Misfortune</hi> leſs hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
you are firſt to bring to your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
That a <hi>Wife</hi> very often maketh
better Figure, for her <hi>Husband</hi>'s making
no great one: And there ſeemeth to be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
reaſon, why the ſame <hi>Lady</hi> that chuſeth
a <hi>Waiting-Woman</hi> with <hi>worſe Looks,</hi> may
not be content with a <hi>Huſband</hi> with <hi>leſs
Wit;</hi> the Argument being equal from the
advantage of the Compariſon. If you will
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52156:28"/>
be more aſhamed in ſome Caſes, of ſuch
a <hi>Husband,</hi> you will be leſs afraid than
you would perhaps be of a wiſe one.
His <hi>Vnſeaſonable Weakneſs</hi> may no doubt
ſometimes grieve you, but then ſet againſt
this, that it giveth you the <hi>Dominion,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
you will make the right uſe of it. It is
next to his being dead, in which Caſe the
<hi>Wife</hi> hath right to Adminiſter; therefore
be ſure, if you have ſuch an Idiot, that
none, except your ſelf, may have the
benefit of the forfeiture; Such a Fool is
a dangerous Beaſt, if others have the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him; and you muſt be very undex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
if when your <hi>Husband</hi> ſhall reſolve
to be an <hi>Aſs,</hi> you do not take care he
may be <hi>your Aſs.</hi> But you muſt go skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
about it and above all things, take
heed of diſtinguiſhing in publick, what kind
of <hi>Husband</hi> he is: Your inward thoughts
muſt not hinder the outward payment of
the conſideration that is due to him: Your
<hi>ſlighting</hi> him in <hi>Company,</hi> beſides that it
would, to a diſcerning By ſtander, give
too great encouragement for the making
nearer applications to you, is in it ſelf ſuch
an undecent way of aſſuming, that it may
provoke the tame Creature to break looſe,
and to ſhew his <hi>Dominion</hi> for his Credit,
which he was content to forget for his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52156:28"/>
Eaſe. In ſhort, the ſureſt and the moſt
approved method will be to do like a wiſe
<hi>Miniſter</hi> to an eaſie <hi>Prince;</hi> firſt give him
the Orders you afterwards receive from
him.</p>
                     <p>With all this, that which you are to
pray for, is a <hi>Wiſe Husband,</hi> one that by
knowing how to be a <hi>Maſter,</hi> for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
reaſon will not let you feel the weight
of it; one whoſe Authority is ſo ſoften'd
by his Kindneſs, that it giveth you eaſe
without abridging your <hi>Liberty;</hi> one that
will return ſo much tenderneſs for your
<hi>Juſt Eſteem</hi> of him, that you will never
want <hi>power,</hi> though you will ſeldom care
to uſe it. Such a <hi>Husband</hi> is as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the other Kinds of them, as a
<hi>rational ſubjection</hi> to a Prince, great in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
is to be preferr'd before the diſquiet
and uneaſineſs of <hi>Vnlimited Liberty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I leave this Head, I muſt add a
little concerning your <hi>Behaviour</hi> to your
<hi>Husband's Friends,</hi> which requireth the
moſt refined part of your Underſtanding
to acquit your ſelf well of it. You are to
ſtudy how to live with them with more
care than you are to apply to any other
part of your Life; eſpecially at firſt, that
you may not ſtumble at the firſt ſetting
out. The <hi>Family</hi> into which you are grafted
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52156:29"/>
will generally be apt to expect, that like a
Stranger in a Foreign Country, you ſhould
conform to their Methods, and not bring
in a new Model by your own Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
The <hi>Friends</hi> in ſuch a Caſe are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to riſe up in Arms as againſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Invaſion, ſo that you are with the
utmoſt Caution to avoid the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of any thing of this Kind. And that
you may with leſs difficulty afterwards
give your Directions, be ſure at firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them from your <hi>Husband</hi>'s Friends.
Gain them to you by early applying to
them, and they will be ſo ſatisfied, that as
nothing is more thankful than Pride, when
it is complied with, they will ſtrive which
of them ſhall moſt recommend you; and
when they have helped you to take Root
in your <hi>Husband</hi>'s good Opinion, you will
have leſs dependence upon theirs, though
you muſt not neglect any reaſonable means
of preſerving it. You are to conſider,
that a Man govern'd by his <hi>Friends,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
eaſily inflamed by them; and that one
who is not ſo, will yet for his own ſake
expect to have them conſider'd. It is eaſily
improved to a point of Honour in a <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
not to have his <hi>Relations</hi> neglected;
and nothing is more dangerous, than to
raiſe an Objection, which is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52156:29"/>
                        <hi>Pride:</hi> It is the moſt ſtubborn and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Paſſion we are ſubject to, and where
it is the firſt cauſe of the <hi>War,</hi> it is very
hard to make a ſecure <hi>Peace.</hi> Your <hi>Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
in this is of the laſt importance to you.</p>
                     <p>And that you may the better ſucceed in
it, carry a ſtrict Eye upon the <hi>Impertinence</hi>
of your <hi>Servants;</hi> take heed that their <hi>Ill-humour</hi>
may not engage you to take Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
or their too much aſſuming i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſmall matters, raiſe Conſequences which
may bring you under great Diſadvantage.
Remember that in the caſe of a <hi>Royal Bride,</hi>
thoſe about her are generally ſo far ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bring in a Foreign Intereſt, that in
moſt Countries they are inſenſibly reduced
to a very ſmall number, and thoſe of ſo low
a Figure, that it doth not admit the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Jealous</hi> of them. In little and in the
Proportion, this may be the Caſe of every
<hi>New married Woman,</hi> and therefore it may
be more adviſeable for you, to gain the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
you find in a Family, than to tie your

                     <p>You are not to overlook theſe ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
becauſe they may appear low and
inconſiderable; for it may be ſaid, that as

there are degrees of Care to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
your ſelf to the World in the ſeveral
parts of your Life. In many things, though
the doing them well may raiſe your <hi>Credit</hi>
and <hi>Eſteem,</hi> yet the omiſſion of them would
draw no immediate reproach upon you: In
others, where your duty is more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

thoſe Faults which are not forgiven, and
will bring you under a <hi>Cenſure,</hi> which will

of your <hi>Houſe, Family,</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>
which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ince it is the Province allotted
to your Sex, and that the <hi>diſcharging it well,</hi>
will for that reaſon be expected from you,
if you either deſert it out of <hi>Lazineſs,</hi> or
manage it ill for <hi>want of skill,</hi> inſtead of a
<hi>Help</hi> you will be an <hi>Incumbrance</hi> to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi>
where you are placed.</p>
                     <p>I muſt tell you, that no <hi>reſpect</hi> is laſting,
but that which is produced by our being
in ſome degree uſeful to thoſe that pay it.
Where that faileth, the Homage and the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52156:31"/>
Reverence go along with it, and fly to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
where ſomething may be expected in
exchange for them. And upon this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
the <hi>reſpects</hi> even of the <hi>Children</hi> and

doth not think them worth their Care,

Therefore take heed of carrying your <hi>good
Breeding</hi> to ſuch a height, as to be good for
nothing, and to be proud of it. Some
think it hath a great Air to be above trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

<hi>Princes</hi> can do, at once to preſerve reſpect,
and to neglect their Buſineſs. No <hi>Age</hi> ever
erected <hi>Altars</hi> to <hi>inſignificant Gods;</hi> they
had all ſome quality applied to them to
draw <hi>worſhip</hi> from <hi>Mankind;</hi> this maketh
it the more unreaſonable for a <hi>Lady</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be conſider'd, and at the ſame time

reſolve not to deſerve it. <hi>Good looks</hi> alone
will not do; they are not ſuch a laſting
<hi>Tenure,</hi> as to be relied upon; and if they
ſhould ſtay longer than they uſually do, it
will by no means be ſafe to depend upon
them: For when time hath abated the
violence of the firſt liking, and that the
<hi>Napp</hi> is a little worn off, though ſtill a
good degree of kindneſs may remain, Men
recover their ſight which before might be
dazell'd, and allow themſelves to object

the <hi>Triumphs</hi> of that day's <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence;</hi>
then wrap'd up in Flattery and
clean Linen, goeth to Bed ſo ſatisfied, that
it throweth her into pleaſant Dreams of
her own Felicity. Such a one is ſeldom
ſerious but with her <hi>Taylor;</hi> her <hi>Children</hi>
and Family may now and then have a
random thought, but ſhe never taketh
aim but at ſomething very Impertinent. I
ſay, when a <hi>Husband,</hi> whoſe Province is
without Doors, and to whom the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of the Houſe would be in ſome
degree Indecent, findeth no <hi>Order</hi> nor
<hi>Quiet</hi> in his <hi>Family,</hi> meeteth with <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints</hi>
of all kinds ſpringing from this
Root; The <hi>Miſtaken Lady,</hi> who thinketh
to make <hi>amends</hi> for all this, by having
a well-choſen <hi>Petty Coat,</hi> will at laſt be
convinced of her <hi>Error,</hi> and with grief
be forced to undergo the Penalties that
belong to thoſe who are willfully <hi>Inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant.</hi>
When this ſcurvy hour cometh
upon her, ſhe firſt groweth <hi>Angry;</hi> then
when the time of it is paſt, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
grow <hi>wiſer,</hi> not remembring that
we can no more have <hi>Wiſdom</hi> than
<hi>Grace,</hi> whenever we think fit to call for
it. There are Times and Periods fix'd
for both; and when they are too long
neglected, the Puniſhment is, that they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52156:32"/>
are <hi>Irrecoverable,</hi> and nothing remaineth
but an uſeleſs <hi>Grief</hi> for the Folly of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thrown them out of our power. You
are to think what a mean Figure a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
maketh, when ſhe is ſo degraded
by her own Fault; whereas there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in thoſe Duties which are expected
from you, that can be a leſſening to you,
except your want of <hi>Conduct</hi> makes it ſo.
You may love your <hi>Children</hi> without liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <hi>Nurſery,</hi> and you may have a
<hi>competent</hi> and <hi>diſcreet care</hi> of them, with
out letting it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> break out upon the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or expoſing your ſelf by turning your
Diſcourſe that way, which is a kind of
<hi>Laying Children</hi> to the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> and it can
hardly be done any where, that thoſe
who hear it will be ſo forgiving, as
not to think they are overcharged with
them. A Woman's <hi>tenderneſs</hi> to her <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
is one of the leaſt deceitful Evidences
of the Vertue; but yet the way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
it, muſt be ſubject to the Rules
of <hi>good Breeding:</hi> And though a <hi>Woman</hi>
of <hi>Quality</hi> ought not to be leſs kind to
them, than <hi>Mothers</hi> of the <hi>Meaneſt Rank</hi>
are to theirs, yet ſhe may diſtinguiſh her
ſelf in the <hi>manner,</hi> and avoid the courſe
Methods, which in Women of a lower ſize
might be more excuſable. You muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52156:33"/>
early to make them <hi>love</hi> you, that
they may <hi>obey</hi> you. This Mixture is no
where more neceſſary than in Children.
And I muſt tell you, that you are not
to expect Returns of Kindneſs from
yours, if ever you have any, without
Grains of Allowance; and yet it is not
ſo much a <hi>defect</hi> in their <hi>good Nature,</hi>
as a <hi>ſhortneſs of Thought</hi> in them. Their
firſt <hi>Inſufficiency</hi> maketh them lean ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
upon their <hi>Parents</hi> for what is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi>
that the <hi>habit</hi> of it maketh them
continue the ſame <hi>Expectations</hi> for what
is <hi>unreaſonable;</hi> and as often as they are
<hi>denied,</hi> ſo often they think they are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured:</hi>
and whilſt their <hi>Deſires</hi> are ſtrong,
and their <hi>Reaſons</hi> yet in the Cradle, their
<hi>Anger</hi> looketh no farther than the thing
they long for and cannot have; And to
be <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> for their <hi>own good,</hi> is a <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi>
they are very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>low to understand: So
that you may conclude, the firſt Thoughts
of your <hi>Children</hi> will have no ſmall Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Mutiny; which being ſo natural,
you muſt not be angry, except you would
increaſe it. You muſt deny them as ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
as you can, and when there is no
avoiding it, you muſt do it <hi>gently;</hi> you
muſt flatter away their ill Humour, and
take the next Opportunity of pleaſing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52156:33"/>
them in ſome other thing, before they
either ask or look for it: This will
ſtrengthen your <hi>Authority,</hi> by making it
ſoft to them; and confirm their <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
by making it their Intereſt. You
are to have as ſtrict a Guard upon your
ſelf amongſt your <hi>Children,</hi> as if you were
amongſt your <hi>Enemies.</hi> They are apt to
make wrong Inferences, to take Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
from half Words, and miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
what you may ſay or do, ſo as either
to leſſen their <hi>Duty,</hi> or to extend their
<hi>Liberty</hi> farther than is convenient. Let
them be more in awe of your <hi>Kindneſs</hi>
than of your <hi>Power.</hi> And above all, take
heed of ſupporting a <hi>Favourite Child</hi> in
its Impertinence, which will give Right
to the reſt of claiming the ſame Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege.
If you have a divided Number, leave
the <hi>Boys</hi> to the <hi>Father</hi>'s more peculiar Care,
that you may with the greater Juſtice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to a more immediate Juriſdiction over
thoſe of your own <hi>Sex.</hi> You are to live
ſo with them, that they may never chuſe
to avoid you, except when they have <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;</hi>
and then let them tremble, that
they may diſtinguiſh: But their Penance
muſt not continue ſo long as to grow too
<hi>ſowre</hi> upon their <hi>Stomachs,</hi> that it may not
<hi>harden</hi> in ſtead of <hi>correcting</hi> them: The
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52156:34"/>
kind and ſevere Part muſt have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>turns</hi> ſeaſonably applied; but your
<hi>Indulgence</hi> is to have the broader mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that <hi>Love,</hi> rather than <hi>Fear,</hi> may
be the Root of their <hi>Obedience.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Servants</hi> are in the next place
to be conſidered; and you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
not to fall into the miſtake of
thinking, that becauſe they receive Wages,
and are ſo much <hi>Inferiour</hi> to you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are <hi>below</hi> your Care to know
how to manage them. It would be as
good Reaſon for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a <hi>Maſter Workman</hi> to
deſpiſe the <hi>Wheels</hi> of his <hi>Engines,</hi> becauſe
they are made of <hi>Wood.</hi> Theſe are the
<hi>Wheels</hi> of your <hi>Family;</hi> and let your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
be never ſo faultleſs, yet if theſe
<hi>Engines</hi> ſtop or move wrong, the whole
Order of your <hi>Houſe</hi> is either at a ſtand,
or diſcompoſed. Beſides, the <hi>Inequality</hi>
which is between you, muſt not make
you forget, that <hi>Nature</hi> maketh no ſuch
diſtinction, but that <hi>Servants</hi> may be
looked upon as <hi>humble Friends,</hi> and that
<hi>Returns</hi> of <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>good Vſage</hi> are as
much due to ſuch of them as deſerve
it, as their <hi>Service</hi> is due to <hi>us</hi> when we
require it. <hi>A fooliſh haughtineſs</hi> in the Style
of <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> or in the manner of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding</hi>
them, is in it ſelf very undecent;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52156:34"/>
beſides that it begetteth an <hi>Averſion</hi> in
them, of which the leaſt ill Effect to be
expected, is, that they will be <hi>ſlow</hi> and
<hi>careleſs</hi> in all that is injoyned them: And
you will find it true by your Experience,
that you will be ſo much the more <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
as you are leſs <hi>Imperious.</hi> Be not <hi>too
haſty</hi> in giving your <hi>Orders,</hi> not <hi>too an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry</hi>
when they are not altogether <hi>obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
much leſs are you to be loud, and
too much diſturbed: An <hi>evenneſs</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
when they do well or <hi>ill,</hi> is
that which will make your <hi>Family</hi> move
by a Rule, and without Noiſe, and will the
better ſet out your Skill in conducting
it with Eaſe and Silence, that it may be
like a well diſciplin'd Army; which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
how to anticipate the <hi>Orders</hi> that are
fit to be given them. You are never
to neglect the Duty of the <hi>preſent Hour,</hi>
to do another thing, which though it
may be better in it ſelf, is not to be
unſeaſonably preferred. Allot well cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Hours for the Inſpection of your <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,</hi>
which may be ſo diſtinguiſhed from
the reſt of your Time, that the <hi>neceſſary
Cares</hi> may come in their proper Place,
without any Influence upon your good
Humour, or Interruption to other things.
By theſe Methods you will put your ſelf
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52156:35"/>
in poſſeſſion of being valued by your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and then their <hi>Obedience</hi> will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
follow.</p>
                     <p>I muſt not forget one of the greateſt
<hi>Articles</hi> belonging to a <hi>Family,</hi> which is
the <hi>Expence.</hi> It muſt not be ſuch, as by
failing either in the Time or meaſure of
it, may rather draw <hi>Cenſure</hi> than gain <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</hi>
If it was well examined, there is
more Money given to be laughed at, than
for any one thing in the World, though
the Purchaſers do not think ſo. A well-ſtated
Rule is like the <hi>Line,</hi> when that is
once paſs'd we are under another <hi>Pole;</hi>
ſo the firſt <hi>ſtraying</hi> from a <hi>Rule,</hi> is a ſtep
towards making that which was before a
<hi>Vertue,</hi> to change its Nature, and to grow
either into a <hi>Vice,</hi> or at leaſt an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence.</hi>
The Art of laying out Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
wiſe'y, is not attained to without a
great deal of thought; and it is yet more
difficult in the Caſe of a <hi>Wife,</hi> who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to her <hi>Husband</hi> for her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes
in it. It is not only his <hi>Money,</hi>
his <hi>Credit</hi> too is at Stake, if what lyeth
under the <hi>Wife</hi>'s Care is managed, either
with undecent <hi>Thrift,</hi> or too looſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</hi>
You are therefore to keep the
<hi>Mean</hi> between theſe two <hi>Extremes,</hi> and
it being hardly poſſible to hold the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52156:35"/>
exactly even, let it rather incline to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Laberal</hi> ſide as more ſuitable to
your <hi>Quality,</hi> and leſs ſubject to <hi>Reproach.</hi>
Of the two a little <hi>Money</hi> miſpent is ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>recovered,</hi> than the <hi>Credit</hi> which is loſt
by having it unhandſomely <hi>ſaved;</hi> and a
Wiſe <hi>Husband</hi> will leſs forgive a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
piece of <hi>Parcimony,</hi> than a little <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance,</hi>
if it be not too often repeated.
His <hi>Mind</hi> in this muſt be your chief <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;</hi>
and his <hi>Temper,</hi> when once known,
will in great meaſure, juſtifie your part
in the management, if he is pleaſed with
it.</p>
                     <p>In your <hi>Clothes</hi> avoid too much Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
do not value your ſelf upon an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered
Gown;</hi> and remember, that a
<hi>reaſonable Word,</hi> or an <hi>obliging Look,</hi> will
gain you more reſpect, than all your <hi>fine
Trappings.</hi> This is not ſaid to reſtrain
you from a <hi>decent Compliance</hi> with the
World, provided you take the wiſer, and
not the fooliſher part of your Sex for
your Pattern. Some <hi>diſtinctions</hi> are to be
allowed, whilſt they are well ſuited to
your <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> and in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution
of the Expence, it ſeemeth to
me that a <hi>full Attendance,</hi> and <hi>well choſen
Ornaments</hi> for your Houſe, will make you a
better Figure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than <hi>too much glittering</hi> in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52156:36"/>
what you wear, which may with more
eaſe be imitated by thoſe that are below
you. Yet this muſt not tempt you to
ſtarve every thing but your own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment;
or in order to more abundance
there, give juſt cauſe to the leaſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
you have, to complain of the Want
of what is neceſſary. Above all, fix it
in your thoughts, as an unchangeable
<hi>Maxim,</hi> That nothing is <hi>truly fine</hi> but what
is <hi>fit,</hi> and that juſt ſo much as is proper
for your <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of their ſeveral kinds,
is much finer than all you can add to it.
When you once break through theſe bounds,
you launch into a wide Sea of <hi>Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance.</hi>
Every thing will become neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
becauſe you have a mind to it; and
you have a mind to it, not becauſe it is
<hi>fit</hi> for you, but becauſe ſome body elſe
<hi>hath it.</hi> This <hi>Lady</hi>'s <hi>Logick</hi> fetteth <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
upon its Head, by carrying the <hi>Rule
from</hi> things to <hi>Perſons;</hi> and appealing from
what is <hi>right</hi> to every Fool that is in the
<hi>wrong.</hi> The word <hi>neceſſary</hi> is miſerably
applyed, it diſordereth <hi>Families,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturneth
<hi>Governments</hi> by being ſo abuſed.
Remember that <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Fools</hi> want
every thing becauſe they want Wit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh:
and therefore there is no ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Evidence of a <hi>Crazy Vnderſtanding,</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:52156:36"/>
than the making too large a Catalogue
of things neceſſary, when in truth there
are ſo very few things that have a right
to be placed in it. Try every thing firſt
in your <hi>Judgment,</hi> before you allow it a
place in your <hi>Deſire;</hi> elſe your <hi>Husband</hi>
may think it as neceſſary for him to deny,
as it is for you to <hi>have</hi> whatever is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable:
and if you ſhall too often give
him that advantage, the habit of <hi>refuſing</hi>
may perhaps reach to things that are not
unfit for you.</p>
                     <p>There are unthinking <hi>Ladies,</hi> who do
not enough conſider, how little their own
Figure agreeth with the <hi>fine things</hi> they
are ſo proud of. Others when they have
them will hardly allow them to be <hi>viſible;</hi>
they cannot be ſeen without <hi>Light,</hi> and
that is many times ſo ſawcy and ſo pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that like a too forward <hi>Gallant</hi> it is
to be forbid the <hi>Chamber.</hi> Some, when
you are uſhered into their <hi>Dark Ruelle,</hi>
it is with ſuch ſolemnity, that a Man
would ſwear there was ſomething in it,
till the <hi>Vnskilful Lady</hi> breaketh ſilence,
and beginneth a Chat, which diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it is a Puppet play with Magnificent
Scenes. Many eſteem things rather as they
are hard to be gotten, than that they are
worth getting: This looketh as if they
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52156:37"/>
had an Intereſt to purſue that Maxim,
becauſe a great part of their own <hi>value</hi>
dependeth upon it. Truth in theſe Caſes
would be often <hi>unmannerly,</hi> and might
derogate from the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> great <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
would aſſume to them ſelves, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſtinct Creatures from thoſe of their
Sex, which are inferiour, and of leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
acceſs.</p>
                     <p>In other things too, your Condition
muſt give the rule to you, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not a Wife's part to aim at
more than a bounded <hi>Liberality;</hi> the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extent of that <hi>Quality</hi> (otherwiſe to
be commended) belongeth to the <hi>Husband,</hi>
who hath better means for it. <hi>Generoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
wrong placed becometh a <hi>Vice.</hi> It is
no more a <hi>Vertue</hi> when it groweth into
an <hi>Inconvenience, Vertues</hi> muſt be inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or reſtrained according to differing Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
A <hi>Princely Mind</hi> will undo a
<hi>private Family:</hi> Therefore things muſt be
ſuited, or elſe they will not deſerve to be
Commended, let them in themſelves be
never ſo valuable: And the Expectations
of the World are beſt anſwered when we
acquit our ſelves in that manner which
ſeemeth to be preſcribed to our ſeveral
Conditions, without uſurping upon thoſe
Duties, which do not ſo particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to us.</p>

I will cloſe the conſideration of this
<hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Expence,</hi> with this ſhort word.
Do not <hi>fetter</hi> your ſelf with ſuch a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint</hi>
in it as may make you <hi>Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi>
but remember that <hi>Vertue</hi> is the

                     <p>IT is time now to lead you out of your
<hi>Houſe</hi> into the <hi>World.</hi> A Dangerous
ſtep; where your Vertue alone will not
ſecure you, except it is attended with a
great deal of <hi>Prudence.</hi> You muſt have
<hi>both</hi> for your <hi>Guard,</hi> and not ſtir without
them. The Enemy is abroad, and you
are ſure to be taken, if you are found
ſtragling. Your <hi>Behaviour</hi> is therefore
to incline ſtrongly towards the <hi>Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
part;</hi> your <hi>Character</hi> is to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably
fixed upon that Bottom, not
excluding a mixture of greater freedom,
as far as it may be innocent and well timed.
The <hi>Extravagancies</hi> of the Age have made
<hi>Caution</hi> more neceſſary; and by the ſame
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52156:38"/>
reaſon that the too great Licence of ill
Men hath by Conſequence in many things
reſtrained the Lawful Liberty of thoſe who
did not abuſe it, the unjuſtifiable Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of ſome of your Sex have involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the reſt in the Penalty of being reduced.
And though this cannot ſo alter the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things, as to make that <hi>Criminal,</hi>
which in it ſelf is <hi>Indifferent;</hi> yet if it
maketh it <hi>dangerous,</hi> that alone is ſufficient
to juſtifie the <hi>Reſtraint.</hi> A <hi>cloſe behaviour</hi>
is the fitteſt to receive <hi>Vertue</hi> for its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>Gueſt,</hi> becauſe there, and there only,
it can be ſecure. Proper <hi>Reſerves</hi> are the
Outworks, and muſt never be deſerted by
thoſe who intend to keep the Place; they
keep off the poſſibilities not only of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>taken,</hi> but of being <hi>attempted;</hi> and
if a Woman ſeeth Danger tho at never ſo
remote a Diſtance, ſhe is for that time
to ſhorten her <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>Liberty.</hi> She who
will allow her ſelf to go to the <hi>utmoſt
Extent</hi> of every thing that is <hi>Lawful,</hi> is
ſo very near going farther, that thoſe who
lie at watch, will begin to count upon
her.</p>

                        <hi>Mankind,</hi> from the double temptation
of <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Deſire,</hi> is apt to turn every

and there are few who dare make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52156:38"/>
Application, till they diſcern ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

to <hi>cure</hi> it. It gathereth Strength by the

having been at any time ſuffered with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity.
Therefore nothing is with more
care to be avoided, than ſuch a kind of
<hi>Civility</hi> as may be miſtaken for <hi>Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and it will not be enough for you to
keep your ſelf free from any criminal
<hi>Engagements;</hi> for if you do that which

there is a Spot thrown upon your Good

which may ſecure you, without offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. No ill-bred affected <hi>Shyneſs,</hi>
nor a <hi>Roughneſs,</hi> unſuitable to your <hi>Sex,</hi> and
unneceſſary to your <hi>Vertue;</hi> but a way of
Living that may prevent all courſe <hi>Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
or <hi>unmannerly Freedoms; Looks</hi> that
forbid without <hi>Rudeneſs,</hi> and oblige with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Invitation,</hi> or leaving room for the
ſawcy Inferences Men's Vanity ſuggeſteth
to them upon the leaſt Encouragements.
This is ſo very nice, that it muſt engage
you to have a perpetual <hi>Watch</hi> upon your
<hi>Eyes,</hi> and to remember, that one careleſs
<hi>Glance</hi> giveth more advantage than a <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Words</hi> not enough conſidered; the
<hi>Language</hi> of the <hi>Eyes</hi> being very much the

                     </p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Civility,</hi> which is always to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
muſt not be carried to a <hi>Compliance,</hi>
which may betray you into irrecoverable
Miſtakes. This <hi>French</hi> ambiguous word
<hi>Complaiſance</hi> hath led your Sex into more
blame, than all other things put together.
It carrieth them by degrees into a certain
thing called a <hi>good kind</hi> of <hi>Woman,</hi> an
eaſie <hi>Idle Creature,</hi> that doth neither <hi>Good</hi>
nor <hi>Ill</hi> but by <hi>chance,</hi> hath no <hi>Choice,</hi> but

                        <hi>Time,</hi> which by degrees addeth to the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of <hi>Words,</hi> hath made her, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Modern Stile, little better than
one who thinketh it a <hi>Rudeneſs</hi> to deny
when civilly required, either her <hi>Service in
Perſon,</hi> or her <hi>friendly Aſſiſtance,</hi> to thoſe
who would have a <hi>meeting,</hi> or want a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident.</hi>
She is a certain thing always at
hand, an eaſie <hi>Companion,</hi> who hath ever
great <hi>Compaſſion</hi> for <hi>diſtreſſed Lovers:</hi> She
cenſureth nothing but <hi>Rigor,</hi> and is never
without a <hi>Plaiſter</hi> for a <hi>wounded Reputation,</hi>
in which chiefly lieth her Skill in <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery;</hi>
She ſeldom hath the Propriety of
any <hi>particular Gallant,</hi> but liveth upon <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kage,</hi>
and waiteth for the Scraps her Friends
are content to leave her.</p>
                     <p>There is another <hi>Character</hi> not quite ſo
<hi>Criminal,</hi> yet not leſs <hi>Ridiculous;</hi> which is
that of a <hi>good-humour'd Woman,</hi> one who
thinketh ſhe muſt always be in a <hi>Laugh,</hi>
or a broad <hi>Smile,</hi> becauſe <hi>Good-humour</hi> is
an obliging Quality; thinketh it leſs ill-manners
to talk <hi>Impertinently,</hi> than to be
ſilent in Company. When ſuch a prating
<hi>Engine</hi> rideth <hi>Admiral,</hi> and carrieth the
<hi>Lantern,</hi> in a <hi>Circle of Fools,</hi> a <hi>cheerful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb</hi>
coming in for a <hi>Recruit,</hi> the <hi>Chattering</hi>
of <hi>Monkeys</hi> is a better noiſe than ſuch a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52156:40"/>
                        <hi>Concert</hi> of <hi>ſenceleſs Merriment.</hi> If ſhe is
applauded in it, ſhe is ſo encouraged, that,
like a <hi>Ballad ſinger,</hi> who if commanded,
breaketh his Lungs, ſhe letteth her ſelf
looſe, and overfloweth upon the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
She conceiveth that Mirth is to have
no intermiſſion, and therefore ſhe will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it about with her, though it be to a
<hi>Funeral;</hi> and if a Man ſhould put a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Queſtion, ſhe doth not know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well how to be angry, for then ſhe
would be no more that pretty thing called
a <hi>Good humour'd Woman.</hi> This neceſſity
of appearing at all times to be ſo infinitely
pleaſed is a grievous miſtake; ſince in a
<hi>handſom Woman</hi> that <hi>Invitation</hi> is unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and in one who is not ſo, <hi>ridiculous.</hi>
It is not intended by this, that you ſhould
forſwear <hi>Laughing;</hi> but remember, that
Fools being always painted in that poſture,
it may fright thoſe who are wiſe from
doing it too frequently, and going too
near a Copy which is ſo little inviting,
and much more from doing it <hi>loud,</hi> which
is an unnatural Sound and looketh ſo much
like another Sex, that few things are more
offenſive. That <hi>boilterous</hi> kind of <hi>Jollity</hi>
is as contrary to <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Good Manners,</hi> as
it is to <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> Beſides, it is
a courſe kind of quality, that throweth a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52156:41"/>
Woman into a lower Form, and degradeth
her from the Rank of thoſe who are more
refined. Some <hi>Ladies</hi> ſpeak <hi>loud</hi> and make
a <hi>noiſe</hi> to be the more minded, which
looketh as if they beat their <hi>Drums</hi> for
<hi>Volunteers,</hi> and if by misfortune none come
in to them, they may, not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
be a good deal out of Countenance.</p>
                     <p>There is one thing, yet more to be
avoided, which is the <hi>Example</hi> of thoſe
who intend nothing farther than the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> and think themſelves
ſecure of not having their Honour tainted
by it. Some are apt to believe their <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
is too <hi>Obſcure,</hi> and not <hi>enough known,</hi>
except it is expoſed to a <hi>broader Light,</hi>
and ſet out to its beſt advantage, by ſome
publick Trials. Theſe are dangerous expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
and generally fail, being built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo weak a foundation, as that of a too
great <hi>Confidence</hi> in our ſelves. It is as ſafe
to play with <hi>Fire,</hi> as to daily with <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry.
Love</hi> is a Paſſion that hath Friends
in the Garriſon, and for that reaſon muſt
by a Woman be kept at ſuch a diſtance,
that ſhe may not be within the danger
of doing the moſt uſual thing in the
World which is conſpiring againſt her
Self: Elſe the humble Gallant, who is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admitted as a Trophy, very often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52156:41"/>
the Conquerour; he putteth on
the ſtyle of victory, and from an <hi>Admirer</hi>
groweth into a <hi>Maſter,</hi> for ſo he may be
called from the moment he is in Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The firſt Reſolutions of ſtopping at
good Opinion and Eſteem, grow weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by degrees againſt the Charms of
<hi>Courtſhip</hi> skilfully applied. A Lady is apt
to think a Man ſpeaketh ſo much reaſon
whilſt he is <hi>Commending</hi> her, that ſhe
hath much ado to believe him in the
wrong when he is making Love to her:
And when beſides the natural Inducements
your Sex hath to be merciful, ſhe is
bribed by well choſen <hi>Flattery,</hi> the poor
Creature is in danger of being caught like
a Bird liſtening to the Whilſtle of one that
hath a Snare for it. <hi>Conqueſt</hi> is ſo tempting
a thing, that it often maketh Women
miſtake Men's <hi>Submiſſions;</hi> which with all
their fair Appearance, have generally leſs,
<hi>Reſpect</hi> than <hi>Art</hi> in them. You are to
remember, that Men who ſay extreme
fine things, many times ſay them moſt for
their own ſakes; and that the vain Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
is often as well pleaſed with his own
<hi>Compliments,</hi> as he could be with the <hi>kindeſt
anſwer.</hi> Where there is not that <hi>Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
you are to ſuſpect there is <hi>Deſign,</hi>
And as ſtrong <hi>perfumes</hi> are ſeldom uſed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52156:42"/>
but where they are neceſſary to ſmother
an unwelcome <hi>ſcent;</hi> ſo <hi>Exceſſive good Words</hi>
leave room to believe they are ſtrewed
to cover ſomething, which is to gain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
under a Diſguiſe. You muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be upon your Guard, and conſider,
that of the two, <hi>Reſpect</hi> is more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than <hi>Anger.</hi> It puts even the beſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings
out of their place for the
time, till their ſecond thoughts reſtore them;
it ſtealeth upon us inſenſibly, throweth
down our <hi>Defences,</hi> and maketh it too late
to reſiſt, after we have given it that
advantage. Whereas railing goeth away
in ſound; it hath ſo much noiſe in it, that
by giving warning it beſpeaketh Caution.
<hi>Reſpect</hi> is a ſlow and a ſure <hi>Poiſon,</hi> and
like <hi>Poiſon</hi> ſwelleth us within our ſelves.
Where it prevaileth too much, it groweth
to be a kind of <hi>Apoplexie</hi> in the Mind,
turneth it quite round, and after it hath
once ſeized the underſtanding, becometh
<hi>mortal</hi> to it. For theſe reaſons, the ſafeſt
way is to treat it like a ſly Enemy, and to
be perpetually upon the watch againſt it.</p>
                     <p>I will add one <hi>Advice</hi> to conclude this
head, which is that you will let every ſeven
years make ſome alteration in you towards
the <hi>Graver</hi> ſide, and not be like the <hi>Girls</hi>
of Fifty, who reſolve to be always <hi>Young,</hi>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:52156:42"/>
whatever <hi>Time</hi> with his Iron Teeth hath
determined to the contrary. Unnatural
things carry a <hi>Deformity</hi> in them never to
be <hi>Diſguiſed;</hi> the <hi>Livelineſs</hi> of <hi>Youth</hi> in a
riper Age, looketh like a <hi>new patch</hi> upon
an <hi>old Gown;</hi> ſo that a <hi>Gay Matron,</hi> a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>old Fool</hi> may be reaſonably put into
the Liſt of the <hi>Tamer</hi> kind of <hi>Monſters.</hi>
There is a certain Creature call'd a <hi>Grave
Hobby-Horſe,</hi> a kind of a ſhe <hi>Numps,</hi> that
pretendeth to be pulled to a Play, and
muſt needs go to <hi>Bartholomew-Fair,</hi> to look
after the young Folks, whom ſhe only
ſeemeth to make her care, in reality ſhe
taketh them for her excuſe. Such an old
<hi>Butterfly</hi> is of all <hi>Creatures,</hi> the moſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous,
and the ſooneſt found out. It is
good to be early in your Caution, to avoid
any thing that cometh within diſtance of
ſuch deſpicable Patterns, and not like ſome
<hi>Ladies,</hi> who defer their <hi>Converſion,</hi> till they
have been ſo long in poſſeſſion of being
laughed at, that the World doth not
know how to change their ſtyle, even
when they are reclaimed from that which
gave the firſt occaſion for it.</p>
                     <p>The advantages of being <hi>reſerved</hi> are
too many to be ſet down, I will only ſay,
that it is a <hi>Guard</hi> to a <hi>good Woman,</hi> and a
<hi>Diſguiſe</hi> to an <hi>ill one.</hi> It is of ſo much uſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52156:43"/>
to both, that thoſe ought to uſe it as an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice,</hi>
who refuſe to practiſe it as a <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</hi>

be looked upon at leaſt as a Well-wiſher if
not a <hi>Partner</hi> with her in her Faults.
If you can forgive them in another, it may
be preſumed you will not be leſs gentle to
your ſelf; and therefore you muſt not

take it ill, if you are reckoned a <hi>Croupiere,</hi>
and condemned to pay an equal Share with
ſuch a Friend of the <hi>Reputation</hi> ſhe hath

                     <p>If it happeneth that your <hi>Friend</hi> ſhould
fall from the State of <hi>Innocence</hi> after your
Kindneſs was engaged to her, you may be
ſlow in your belief in the beginning of the
Diſcovery: But as ſoon as you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by a <hi>Rational Evidence,</hi> you muſt,
without breaking too <hi>roughly,</hi> make a far
and a quick <hi>Retreat</hi> from ſuch a <hi>Miſtaken

from one that is ſo tainted, the Contagion
may reach you ſo far as to give you part
of the <hi>Scandal,</hi> though not of the <hi>Guilt.</hi>
This Matter is ſo nice, that as you muſt not
be too haſty to <hi>joyn</hi> in the <hi>Cenſure</hi> upon

are not on the other ſide to <hi>defend</hi> her

that the Caſe might be your own. For this
reaſon you are not to carry your <hi>dearneſs</hi>

elſe your Exceſs of Good Nature
may betray you into a very <hi>ridiculous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi>
and by degrees who may be preferr'd
to ſuch Offices as you will not be proud

to what is <hi>Criminal,</hi> a <hi>Contempt</hi> of what is
<hi>ridiculous,</hi> are the <hi>inſeparable Companions</hi> of

is neither poſſible nor fit to <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> them

Liberty</hi> of this kind is little leſs

War to the World, which is an <hi>angry Beaſt</hi>
when ſo provoked. The Conteſt will be
<hi>unequal;</hi> though you are never ſo much in
the right; and if you begin againſt ſuch
an Adversary, it will tear you in pieces,
with this Juſtification, That it is done in
its own defence. You muſt therefore take

againſt Bullets; and it is the <hi>diſadvantage</hi>
of a Woman, that the Malice of the World

throw a <hi>ſlovenly Vntruth</hi> upon her. You

for Fools; who beſides that they are
too ſtrong a Party to be unneceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,

<hi>Rage</hi> will return a <hi>dull Jeſt</hi> that will lie
heavy, though there is not a <hi>Grain</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi>
in it. Others will do it with more Art,
and you muſt not think your ſelf ſecure
becauſe your <hi>Reputation</hi> may perhaps be
out of the reach of <hi>Ill will;</hi> for if it findeth
that part <hi>guarded,</hi> it will ſeek one which is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52156:46"/>
more <hi>expoſed.</hi> It flieth, like a corrupt Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
in the Body, to the <hi>weakeſt</hi> Part. If
you have a <hi>tender Side,</hi> the World will
be ſure to find it, and to put the worſt
<hi>Colour</hi> upon all you ſay or do, give an
<hi>Aggravation</hi> to every thing that may leſſen
you, and a <hi>Spiteful turn</hi> to every thing
that might recommend you. <hi>Anger</hi> laieth
open thoſe Defects which <hi>Friendſhip</hi> would
not ſee, and <hi>Civility</hi> might be willing to
forget. <hi>Malice</hi> needeth no ſuch <hi>Invitation</hi>
to encourage it, neither are any <hi>Pains</hi>
more ſuperfluous than thoſe we take to
be ill ſpoken of. If <hi>Envy,</hi> which never dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

to be in a <hi>Slumber,</hi> it is very unskilful

                     <p>Beſides, your <hi>Wit</hi> will be miſapplied if
it is wholly directed to diſcern the <hi>Faults</hi> of
<hi>others,</hi> when it is ſo neceſſary to be often

ſending our <hi>Thoughts</hi> too much abroad,
hath the ſame Effect, as when a <hi>Family</hi>
never ſtayeth at home; <hi>Neglect</hi> and <hi>Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
naturally followeth; as it muſt do
within our ſelves, if we do not frequently
turn our Eyes inwards, to ſee what is amiſs
with us, where it is a ſign we have an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
Proſpect,</hi> when we do not care

                        <pb n="67" facs="tcp:52156:46"/>

                     <p>Avoid being the firſt in fixing a <hi>hard Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi>
let it be confirmed by the <hi>general Voice,</hi>
before you give into it; Neither are you
then to give Sentence like a <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> or
as if you had a <hi>ſpecial Authority</hi> to beſtow
a <hi>good</hi> or <hi>ill Name</hi> at your diſcretion.
Do not dwell too long upon a <hi>weak Side,</hi>
touch and go away; take pleaſure to ſtay
longer where you can commend, like Bees
that fix only upon thoſe Herbs out of
which they may extract the Juice of which
their Honey is compoſed. A <hi>Vertue</hi> ſtuck
with <hi>Briſtles</hi> is too rough for this Age; it
muſt be adorned with ſome <hi>Flowers,</hi> or elſe
it will be unwillingly entertained; ſo that
even where it may be fit to ſtrike, do it
like a <hi>Lady,</hi> gently; and aſſure your ſelf,
that where you care to do it, you will
wound others more, and hurt your ſelf leſs,
by <hi>ſoft Strokes,</hi> than by being <hi>harſh</hi> or <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Triumph of <hi>Wit</hi> is to make your
<hi>good. Nature</hi> ſubdue your <hi>Cenſure;</hi> to be
quick in <hi>ſeeing Faults,</hi> and ſlow in <hi>expoſing</hi>
them. You are to conſider, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
thing called a <hi>Good Name,</hi> is made
up of the Breath of Numbers that ſpeak
well of you; ſo that if by a <hi>diſobliging Word</hi>
                        <pb n="68" facs="tcp:52156:47"/>
you ſilence the <hi>meaneſt,</hi> the <hi>Gale</hi> will be
leſs ſtrong which is to bear up your <hi>Eſteem.</hi>
And though nothing is ſo vain as the eager
purſuit of <hi>empty Applauſe,</hi> yet to be well
thought of, and to be kindly uſed by the
World, is like a <hi>Glory</hi> about a Womans
<hi>Head;</hi> 'tis a Perfume ſhe carrieth about
with her, and leaveth where-ever ſhe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
'tis a Charm againſt <hi>Ill-will. Malice</hi>
may empty her Quiver, but cannot wound;
the Dirt will not ſtick, the Jeſts will not
take; Without the conſent of the World
a <hi>Scandal</hi> doth not go deep; it is only a
ſlight ſtroak upon the injured Party and
returneth with the greater force upon
thoſe that gave it.</p>

                     <p>I Muſt with more than ordinary <hi>earneſtneſs</hi>
give you Caution againſt <hi>Vanity,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fault to which your Sex ſeemeth
to be the moſt <hi>inclined;</hi> and ſince <hi>Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
for the moſt part attendeth it, I do
not know how to divide them. I will not
call them <hi>Twins,</hi> becauſe more properly
<hi>Vanity</hi> is the <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Affectation</hi> is the
Darling Daughter; <hi>Vanity</hi> is the Sin, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52156:47"/>
                        <hi>Affectation</hi> is the Puniſhment; the firſt may
be called the Root of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Fruit. Vanity</hi> is never at its full
growth till it ſpreadeth into <hi>Affectation,</hi> and
then it is compleat.</p>
                     <p>Not to dwell any longer upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of them, I will paſs to the means
and motives to avoid them. In order to
it, you are to conſider, that the World
challengeth the right of diſtributing Eſteem
and Applauſe; ſo that where any aſſume
by their ſingle Authority to be their own
<hi>Carvers,</hi> it groweth angry, and never faileth
to ſeek <hi>Revenge.</hi> And if we may meaſure
a Fault by the greatneſs of the <hi>Penalty,</hi>
there are few of a higher ſize than <hi>Vanity,</hi>
as there is ſcarce a Puniſhment which can
be heavier than that of being laughed
at.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vanity</hi> maketh a Woman tainted with
it, ſo top full of her ſelf, that ſhe ſpilleth
it upon the <hi>Company.</hi> And becauſe her own
thoughts are intirely imployed in <hi>Self-Contemplation;</hi>
ſhe endeavoureth, by a cruel
Miſtake, to confine her <hi>Acquaintance</hi> to
the ſame narrow Circle of that which only
concerneth her Ladiſhip, forgetting that
ſhe is not of half that <hi>Importance</hi> to the
World, that ſhe is to her ſelf, ſo miſtaken
ſhe is in her Value, by being her own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſer.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52156:48"/>
She will fetch ſuch a Compaſs
in Diſcourſe to bring in her beloved <hi>Self,</hi>
and rather than fail, her fine Petty-Coat,
that there can hardly be a better Scene than
ſuch a Tryal of ridiculous Ingenuity. It is
a Pleaſure to ſee her Angle for <hi>Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and riſe ſo diſſatisfied with the Ill-bread
<hi>Company,</hi> if they will not <hi>bite.</hi> To
obſerve her throwing her <hi>Eyes</hi> about to
fetch in Priſoners, arid go about Cruizing
like a Privateer, and ſo out or <hi>Countenance,</hi>
if ſhe return without <hi>Booty,</hi> is no ill piece
of Comedy. She is ſo eager to draw re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
that the always miſſeth it, yet think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it ſo much her due, that when ſhe
faileth ſhe groweth <hi>waſpiſh,</hi> not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that it is impoſſible to commit a Rape
upon the will; that it muſt be fairly gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and will not be taken by <hi>Storm;</hi> and
that in this Caſe, the Tax ever riſeth
higheſt by a <hi>Benevolence.</hi> If the World
inſtead of admiring her <hi>Imaginary Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
taketh the Liberty to laugh at them,
ſhe <hi>appealeth</hi> from it to her ſelf, for whom
ſhe giveth <hi>Sentence,</hi> and proclaimeth it in
all <hi>Companies.</hi> On the other ſide, if incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by a <hi>Civil Word,</hi> ſhe is ſo obliging,
that ſhe will give thanks for being laughed
at in good Language. She taketh a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment</hi>
for a Demonſtration, and ſetteth it
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52156:48"/>
up as an <hi>Evidence,</hi> even againſt her Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs.
But the good <hi>Lady</hi> being all this
while in a moſt profound <hi>Ignorance</hi> of her
ſelf, forgetteth that Men would not let her
talk upon them, and throw ſo many
<hi>ſenſeleſs words</hi> at their head, if they did
not intend to put her Perſon to Fine and
Ranſom, for her <hi>Impertinence.</hi> Good words
of any other Lady, are ſo many Stones
thrown at her, ſhe can by no means bear
them, they make her ſo uneaſie, that ſhe
cannot keep her <hi>Seat,</hi> but up ſhe riſeth and
goeth home half burſt with <hi>Anger</hi> and
<hi>Strait-Lacing.</hi> If by great chance ſhe ſaith
any thing that hath ſence in it, ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
ſuch an Exceſſive rate of <hi>Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
that to her thinking the Company
ever riſeth in her <hi>Debt.</hi> She looketh upon
<hi>Rules</hi> as things made for the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and not for Perſons of her <hi>Rank;</hi>
and this Opinion ſometimes tempteth her
to Extend her Prerogative to the diſpencing
with the commandments. If by great <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi>
ſhe happeneth, in ſpite of her <hi>Vanity,</hi>
to be honeſt, ſhe is ſo troubleſome with it,
that as far as in her lieth, ſhe maketh a <hi>ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi>
thing of it. Her bragging of her <hi>Vertue,</hi>
looketh as if it coſt her ſo much pains to
get the better of her Self, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi>
are very ridiculous. Her <hi>good Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:52156:49"/>
is generally applied to the laughing
at <hi>good Senſe.</hi> It would do one good to
ſee how heartily ſhe deſpiſeth any thing
that is fit for her to do. The greateſt part
of her <hi>Fancy</hi> is laid out in chuſing her <hi>Gown,</hi>
as her <hi>Diſcretion</hi> is chiefly imploy'd in <hi>not
paying</hi> for it. She is faithful to the <hi>Faſhion,</hi>
to which not only her <hi>Opinion,</hi> but her
<hi>Senſes</hi> are wholly reſigned: ſo obſequious
ſhe is to it, that ſhe would be ready to
be reconciled even to <hi>Vertue</hi> with all its
<hi>Faults,</hi> if ſhe had her Dancing Maſter's
Word that it was practis'd at Court.</p>
                     <p>To a Woman ſo compos'd when <hi>Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
cometh in to improve her <hi>Character,</hi>
it is then raiſed to the higheſt <hi>Perfection.</hi>
She firſt ſetteth up for a <hi>Fine thing,</hi> and for
that Reaſon will diſtinguiſh her ſelf, right
or wrong, in every thing ſhe doth. She
would have it thought that ſhe is made
of ſo much the <hi>finer Clay,</hi> and ſo much
more <hi>ſifted</hi> than ordinary, that ſhe hath
no <hi>common Earth</hi> about her. To this end
ſhe muſt neither move nor ſpeak like
other Women, becauſe it would be <hi>vulgar;</hi>
and therefore muſt have a Language of
her <hi>own,</hi> ſince <hi>ordinary Engliſh</hi> is too courſe
for her. The <hi>Looking-gloſs</hi> in the Morning
dictateth to her all the <hi>Motions</hi> of the Day,
which by how much the more <hi>ſtudied,</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:52156:49"/>
are ſo much the more <hi>miſtaken.</hi> She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into a Room as if her Limbs were
ſet on with ill-made Screws, which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Company fear the pretty thing
ſhould leave ſome of its <hi>artificial Perſon</hi>
upon the Floor. She doth not like her
ſelf as <hi>God Almighty</hi> made her, but will have
ſome of <hi>her own</hi> Workmanſhip; which is ſo
far from making her a better thing than
a <hi>Woman,</hi> that it turneth her into a worſe
Creature than a <hi>Monkey.</hi> She falleth out
with <hi>Nature,</hi> againſt which ſhe maketh War
without admitting a <hi>Truce,</hi> thoſe Moments
excepted in which her <hi>Gallant</hi> may recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
her to it. When ſhe hath a mind to be
<hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>languiſhing,</hi> there is ſomthing ſo
unnatural in that <hi>affected Eaſineſs,</hi> that her
<hi>Frowns</hi> could not be by many degrees ſo
forbidden. When ſhe would appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably
<hi>humble,</hi> one may ſee ſhe is ſo
exceſſively <hi>proud,</hi> that there is no enduring
it. There is ſuch an <hi>impertinent Smile,</hi>
ſuch a <hi>ſatisfied Simper,</hi> when ſhe faintly
diſowneth ſome fulſom Commendation a
Man hapneth to beſtow upon her againſt
his Conſcience, that her <hi>Thanks</hi> for it are
more viſible under ſuch a thin <hi>Diſguiſe,</hi>
than they could be if ſhe ſhould <hi>print</hi>
them. If a <hi>handſomer Woman</hi> taketh any
liberty of <hi>Dreſſing</hi> out of the ordinary
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52156:50"/>
Rules the miſtaken Lady followeth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſtinguiſhing the <hi>unequal Pattern,</hi> and
maketh her ſelf <hi>uglier</hi> by an example miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed;
either forgetting the Privilege of
<hi>good Looks</hi> in <hi>another,</hi> or preſuming, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſufficient reaſon upon <hi>her own.</hi> Her
<hi>Diſcourſe</hi> is a <hi>ſenſeleſs Chime</hi> of <hi>empty Words,</hi>
a heap of <hi>Compliments</hi> ſo equally applied to
differing <hi>Perſons,</hi> that they are neither va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lu'd
nor believ'd. Her <hi>Eyes</hi> keep pace
with her <hi>Tongue,</hi> and are therefore always
in <hi>motion.</hi> One may diſcern that they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
incline to the <hi>compaſſionate</hi> ſide, and
that, notwithſtanding her pretence to <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi>
ſhe is gentle to <hi>diſtreſſed Lovers,</hi> and
<hi>Ladies</hi> that are <hi>merciful.</hi> She will repeat
the tender part of a <hi>Play</hi> ſo feelingly, that
the Company may gueſs, without Injuſtice,
ſhe was not altogether a <hi>diſintereſſed Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi>
She thinketh that <hi>Paint</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> are
concealed by railing at them. Upon the
latter ſhe is leſs hard, and being divided
between the two oppoſite Prides of her
<hi>Beauty</hi> and her <hi>Vertue,</hi> ſhe is often tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to give broad Hints that ſome body is
dying for her; and of the two ſhe is leſs
unwilling to let the World think ſhe may
be ſometimes <hi>profan'd,</hi> than that ſhe is never
<hi>worſhipped.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:52156:50"/>
Very great <hi>Beauty</hi> may perhaps ſo dazle
for a time, that Men may not ſo clearly
ſee the <hi>Deformity</hi> of theſe <hi>Affectations;</hi> But
when the <hi>Brightneſs</hi> goeth off, and that
the <hi>Lover's Eyes</hi> are by that means ſet at
liberty to ſee things as they are, he will
naturally return to his Senſes, and recover
the Miſtake into which the Lady's <hi>good
Looks</hi> had at firſt engaged him. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once undeceived, ceaſeth to worſhip
that as a <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> which he ſeeth is only
an <hi>artificial Shrine</hi> moved by <hi>Wheels</hi> and
<hi>Springs,</hi> to delude him. Such Women
pleaſe only like the <hi>firſt Opening</hi> of a <hi>Scene,</hi>
that hath nothing to recommend it but
the being <hi>new.</hi> They may be compared to
<hi>Flies,</hi> that have pretty ſhining <hi>Wings</hi> for

It is an <hi>ambiguous Word;</hi> one kind

                     <p>A Woman is not to be proud of her
fine Gown; nor when ſhe hath leſs Wit
than her Neighbours, to comfort her ſelf
that ſhe hath more Lace. Some Ladies
put ſo much weight upon <hi>Ornaments,</hi> that
if one could ſee into their Hearts, it would
be found, that even the Thought of <hi>Death</hi>
is made leſs heavy to them by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of their being <hi>laid out</hi> in <hi>State,</hi>
and <hi>honourably attended</hi> to the <hi>Grave.</hi> One
may come a good deal ſhort of ſuch an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream,</hi>
and yet ſtill be ſufficiently <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi>
by ſetting a wrong Value upon things,
which ought to be uſed with more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference.
A Lady muſt not appear ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52156:51"/>
to ingroſs <hi>Reſpect</hi> to her ſelf, but
be content with a reaſonable <hi>Diſtribution,</hi>
and allow it to others, that ſhe may have
it returned to her. She is not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſomly
<hi>nice,</hi> nor diſtinguiſh her ſelf by
being too <hi>delicate,</hi> as if ordinary things
were too <hi>courſe</hi> for her; this is an <hi>unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly</hi>
and an <hi>offenſive</hi> Pride, and where it is
practiſed, deſerveth to be mortified, of
which it ſeldom faileth. She is not to lean
too much upon her Quality, much leſs to
deſpiſe thoſe who are below it. Some make
<hi>Quality</hi> an <hi>Idol,</hi> and then their <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt
fall down and Worſhip it. They would
have the World think, that no amends can

theſe Caſes: But they are to be reſiſted;
and the utmoſt that is to be allowed, is,
when thoſe of a <hi>new Edition</hi> will forget
themſelves, ſo as either to brag of their
<hi>weak ſide,</hi> or to endeavour to hide their
<hi>Meanneſs</hi> by their <hi>Inſolence,</hi> to cure them
by a little ſeaſonable <hi>Raillery,</hi> a little <hi>Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
well placed, without dwelling too long

                     <p>Theſe and many other kinds of <hi>Pride</hi> are
to be avoided.</p>
                     <p>That which is to be recommended to
you, is an <hi>Emulation</hi> to raiſe your ſelf to a
<hi>Character,</hi> by which you may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed;
an Eagerneſs for precedence in
<hi>Vertue,</hi> and all ſuch other things as may
gain you a greater ſhare of the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <p>THE laſt thing I ſhall recommend to
you, is a wiſe and a ſafe method of
uſing <hi>Diverſions.</hi> To be too eager in the
purſuit of Pleaſure whilſt you are <hi>Young,</hi> is
dangerous; to catch at it in riper <hi>Years,</hi>
is graſping a ſhadow; it will not be held.
Beſides that by being leſs natural it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be indecent. <hi>Diverſions</hi> are the moſt
properly applied, to eaſe and relieve thoſe
who are <hi>Oppreſſed,</hi> by being too much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52156:53"/>
Thoſe that are <hi>Idle</hi> have no need
of them, and yet they, above all others,
give themſelves up to them. To unbend
our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> when they are too much
ſtretched by our Cares, is not more natural
than it is neceſſary, but to turn our whole
Life into a <hi>Holy day,</hi> is not only ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
but deſtroyeth Pleaſure inſtead of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting</hi>
it. The <hi>Mind</hi> like the <hi>Body</hi> is tired
by being always in one Poſture, too ſerious
breaketh, and too diverting looſeneth it:
It is <hi>Variety</hi> that giveth the Reliſh; ſo that
<hi>Diverſions</hi> too frequently repeated, grow
firſt to be indifferent, and at laſt tedious.
Whilſt they are well choſen and well timed,
they are never to be blamed; but when
they are uſed to an Exceſs, though very <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
at firſt, they often grow to be <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,</hi>
and never fail to be <hi>Impertinent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some Ladies are beſpoken for Merry
Meetings, as <hi>Beſſus</hi> was for Duels. They
are ingaged in a Circle of <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> where
they turn round for the whole Year, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Interruption</hi> of a ſerious Hour,
They know all the Players Names, and are
<hi>Intimately</hi> acquainted with all the Booths in
<hi>Bartholomew-Fair.</hi> No Soldier is more <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi>
to the ſound of his Captain's <hi>Trumpet,</hi>
than they are to that which ſummoneth
them to a <hi>Puppet-Play</hi> or a <hi>Monſter.</hi> The

Spring that bringeth out <hi>Flies,</hi> and <hi>Fools,</hi>
maketh them Inhabitants in <hi>Hide-Park;</hi> in
the Winter they are an Incumbrance to the
<hi>Play Houſe,</hi> and the Ballaſt of the <hi>Drawing-Room.</hi>
The Streets all this while are ſo
weary of theſe daily Faces, that <hi>Men</hi>'s <hi>Eyes</hi>
are over-laid with them. The <hi>Sight</hi> is glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with fine things, as the <hi>Stomach</hi> with
ſweet ones; and when a fair <hi>Lady</hi> will give
too much of her ſelf to the <hi>World,</hi> ſhe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
luſcious, and oppreſſeth inſtead of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
Theſe <hi>Jolly Ladies</hi> do ſo continually
ſeek <hi>Diverſion,</hi> that in a little time they
grow into a <hi>Jeſt,</hi> yet are unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that if they were ſeldomer ſeen

or to <hi>divert</hi> your ſelf, is not to be
diſallowed, but to do it ſo often as to be
called a <hi>Gameſter,</hi> is to be avoided, next to
the things that are moſt <hi>Criminal.</hi> It hath
Conſequences of <hi>ſeveral kinds</hi> not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured;
it will ingage you into a habit of

To deep <hi>Play</hi> there will be yet greater

have to <hi>pay</hi> ſuch great <hi>ſumms?</hi> If you pay
<hi>exactly,</hi> it will be enquired from whence the

to a Man, you muſt be ſo very <hi>Civil</hi> to
him for his forbearance, that it layeth a
ground of having it farther improved; if
the <hi>Gentleman</hi> is ſo diſpoſed; who will be
thought no unfair <hi>Creditor,</hi> if where the
<hi>Eſtate</hi> ſaileth he ſeizeth upon the Perſon.
Beſides if a <hi>Lady</hi> could ſee her own Face
upon an <hi>ill Game,</hi> at a deep Stake, ſhe would
certainly forſwear any thing that could put
her looks under ſuch a <hi>Diſadvantage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To <hi>Dance</hi> ſometimes will not be imputed
to you as a fault; but remember that the
end of your <hi>Learning</hi> it, was, that you might
the better know how to move <hi>gracefully.</hi> It
is only an <hi>advantage</hi> ſo far. When it goeth
beyond it, one may call it <hi>excelling</hi> in a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
which is no very great Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
It is better for a <hi>Woman</hi> never to
<hi>Dance,</hi> becauſe ſhe hath no skill. in it, that
to do it too often, becauſe ſhe doth it well.
The eaſieſt as well as the ſafeſt <hi>Method</hi>
of doing it, is in <hi>private Companies,</hi> amongſt
<hi>particular Friends,</hi> and then careleſly, like a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52156:54"/>
                        <hi>Diverſion,</hi> rather than with <hi>Solemnity,</hi> as if
it was a buſineſs, or had any thing in it to
deſerve a <hi>Month's preparation</hi> by ſerious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with a <hi>Dancing-Maſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Much more might be ſaid to all theſe
Heads, and many more might be added to
them. But I muſt reſtrain my Thoughts,
which are full of my Dear Child, and would
overflow into a Volume, which would not
be fit for a <hi>New-Years-Gift.</hi> I will conclude
with my warmeſt Wiſhes for all that is good
to you. That you may live ſo as to be an
Ornament to your Family, and a Pattern
to your Sex. That you may be bleſſed
with a Husband that may value, and with
Children that may inherit your Vertue;
That you may ſhine in the World by a
true Light, and ſilence Envy by deſerving
to be eſteemed; That Wit and Vertue may
both conſpire to make you a great Figure.
When they are ſeparated, the firſt is ſo
empty, and the other ſo ſaint, that they
ſcarce have right to be commended. May
they therefore meet and never part; let
them be your Guardian Angels, and be ſure
never to ſtray out of the diſtance of their
joint protection. May you ſo raiſe your
Character, that you may help to make the
next Age a better thing, and leave Poſterity
in your Debt for the advantage it ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by your Example</p>

                  <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IT muſt be more than an ordinary provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that can tempt a Man to write in an
Age over-run with Scribblers, as <hi>Egypt</hi> was
with Flies and Locuſts: That worſt Vermin
of ſmall Authors has given the World ſuch a
Surfeit, that inſtead of deſiring to Write, a
Man would be more inclin'd to wiſh, for his
own eaſe, that he could not Read; but there are
ſome things which do ſo raiſe our paſſions, that
our Reaſon can make no Reſiſtance; and when
Madmen, in two Extreams, ſhall agree to
make common ſenſe Treaſon, and joyn to fix
an ill Character upon the only Men in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
who deſerve a good one; I am no longer
Maſter of my better Reſolution to let the
World alone, and muſt break looſe from my
more reaſonable Thoughts, to expoſe theſe falſe
Coyners, who would make their Copper Wares
paſs upon us for good Payment.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt all the Engines of Diſſention, there
has been none more powerful in all Times,
than the fixing Names upon one another of
Contumely and Reproach, and the reaſon is
<pb facs="tcp:52156:57"/>
plain, in reſpect of the People, who tho' gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
they are uncapable of making a Syllogiſm
or forming an Argument, yet they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
a word; and that ſerves their turn to
throw it with their dull malice at the Head
of thoſe they do not like; ſuch things ever
begin in Jeſt, and end in Blood, and the ſame
word which at firſt makes the Company merry,
grows in time to a Military Signal to cut one
anothers Throats.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Miſtakes are to be lamented, tho' not
eaſily cured, being ſuitable enough to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Nature of Mankind; but 'tis hard,
that Men will not only invent ill Names, but
they will wreſt and miſinterpret good ones; ſo
afraid ſome are even of a reconciling ſound,
that they raiſe another noiſe to keep it from
being heard, leſt it ſhould ſet up and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
a dangerous ſort of Men, who prefer
Peace and Agreement, before Violence and
Confuſion.</p>
                  <p>Were it not for this, why, after we have
played the Fool with throwing <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory</hi>
at one another, as Boys do Snow-Balls, do
we grow angry at a new Name, which by its
true ſignification might do as much to put us
into our Wits, as the other has done to put
us out of them?</p>
                  <p>This innocent word <hi>Trimmer</hi> ſignifies no
more than this, That if Men are together in a
<pb facs="tcp:52156:57"/>
Boat, and one part of the Company would weigh
it down on one ſide, another would make it
lean as much to the contrary; it happens there
is a third Opinion of thoſe, who conceive it
would do as well, if the Boat went even, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
endangering the Paſſengers; now 'tis hard
to imagin by what Figure in Language, or by
what Rule in Senſe this comes to be a fault,
and it is much more a wonder it ſhould be
thought a Hereſy.</p>
                  <p>But ſo it happens, that the poor <hi>Trimmer</hi>
has now all the Powder ſpent upon him alone,
while the <hi>Whig</hi> is a forgotten, or at leaſt a
neglected Enemy; there is no danger now to
the State (if ſome Men may he believed) but
from the Beaſt called a <hi>Trimmer,</hi> take heed
of him, he is the Inſtrument that muſt deſtroy
Church and State; a new kind of Monſter,
whoſe deformity is ſo expos'd, that, were it a
true Picture that is made of him, it would
be enough to fright Children, and make Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
miſcarry at the ſight of it.</p>
                  <p>But it may be worth the examining, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he is ſuch a Beaſt as he is Painted.
I am not of that Opinion, and am ſo far from
thinking him an Infidel either in Church or
State, that I am neither afraid to expoſe the
Articles of his Faith in Relation to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor to ſay that I prefer them before
any other Political Creed, that either our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
<pb facs="tcp:52156:58"/>
Divines, or our refined States-men would
impoſe upon as.</p>
                  <p>I have therefore in the following Diſcourſe
endeavour'd to explain the <hi>Trimmer's</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Opinions, and then leave it to all
diſcerning and impartial Judges, whether he
can with Juſtice be ſo Arraign'd, and whether
thoſe who deliberately pervert a good Name,
do not very juſtly deſerve the worſt that can
be put upon themſelves.</p>

OF THE
LAWS
AND
GOVERNMENT.</head>
                  <p>OUr Trimmer, as he has a great Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
for Laws in general, ſo
he has more particular for our
own, he looks upon them as the Chains
that tye up our unruly Paſſions, which
elſe, like wild Beaſts let looſe, would reduce
the world into its firſt State of Barbariſm
and Hoſtility; the good things we injoy,
we owe to them; and all the ill things we
are freed from is by their Protection.</p>
                  <p>God himſelf thought it not enough to be
a Creator, without being a Lawgiver, and
his goodneſs had been defective towards
mankind in making them, if he had not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52156:59"/>
preſcribed Rules to make them happy
too.</p>
                  <p>All Laws flow from that of Nature, and
where that is not the Foundation, they may
be legally impos'd, but they will be lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obeyed: By this Nature is not meant
that, which Fools and Madmen miſquote
to juſtify their Exceſſes; it is innocent and
uncorrupted Nature, that which diſpoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Men to chuſe Vertue, without its being
preſcribed, and which is ſo far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring
ill thoughts into us, that we take
pains to ſuppreſs the good ones it infuſes.</p>
                  <p>The Civilized World has ever paid t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
willing ſubjection to Laws, even Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
have done homage to them; as the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who took Patterns of good Laws
even from thoſe they had ſubdued; and
at the ſame time that they Triumph'd over
an enſlav'd People, the very Laws of that
place did not only remain ſafe, but became
Victorious; their new Maſters, inſtead of
ſuppreſſing them, paid them more reſpect
than they had from thoſe who firſt made
them: and by this wiſe method they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
to ſuch an admirable Conſtitution
of Laws, that to this day they Reign by
them; this Excellency of them Triumphs
ſtill, and the World pays now an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of their obedience to that Mighty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52156:59"/>
Empire, though ſo many Ages after it is
diſſolved; and by a later inſtance, the
Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who, in practice uſe their
Laws pretty familiarly, yet think their
Picture is drawn with moſt advantage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Seals, when they are placed in the
Seat of Juſtice; and tho' the Hieroglyphick
is not there of ſo much uſe to the People
as they would wiſh, yet it ſhews that no
Prince is ſo Great, as not to think fit, for
his own Credit at leaſt, to give an outward,
when he refuſes a real worſhip to the Laws.</p>
                  <p>They are to mankind that which the
Sun is to Plants, whilſt it cheriſhes and
preſerves 'em. Where they have their force
and are not clouded or ſuppreſt, every thing
ſmiles and flouriſhes; but where they are
darkened, and not ſuffered to ſhine out,
it makes every thing to wither and decay.</p>
                  <p>They ſecure Men not only againſt one
another, but againſt themſelves too; they
are a Sanctuary to which the Crown has
occaſion to reſort as often as the People,
ſo that it is an Intereſt as well as a Duty
to preſerve them.</p>
                  <p>There would be no end of making a
Panegyrick of Laws; let it be enough to
add, that without Laws the World would
become a Wilderneſs, and Men little leſs
than Beaſts; but with all this, the beſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52156:60"/>
things may come to be the worſt, if they
are not in good hands; and if it be tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
that the wiſeſt Men generally make the
Laws, it is as true, that the ſtrongeſt do
often Interpret them: and as Rivers belong
as much to the Channel where they run,
as to the Spring from whence they firſt
riſe, ſo the Laws depend as much upon the
Pipes thro' which they are to paſs, as upon
the Fountain from whence they flow.</p>
                  <p>The Authority of a King who is Head
of the Law, as well as the Dignity of
Publick Juſtice, is debaſed, when the clear
ſtream of the Law is puddled and diſturbed
by Bunglers, or convey'd by unclean Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the People.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would have them app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>
in their full luſtre, and would be grieved to
ſee the day, when, inſtead of ſpeaking
with Authority from the Seats of Juſtice,
they ſhould ſpeak out of a Grate, with a
lamenting voice like Priſoners that deſle
to be reſcu'd.</p>
                  <p>He wiſhes that the Bench may have a
Natural as well as a Legal Superiority
to the Bar; he thinks Mens ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lities very
much miſplac'd, when the Reaſon of him
that pleads is viſibly too ſtrong for thoſe
who Judge and give Sentence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52156:60"/>
When thoſe from the Bar ſeem to dictate
to their Superiours upon the Bench, their
Furrs will look ſcurvily about them, and
the reſpect of the World will leave the bare
Character of a Judge, to follow the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
knowledge of a Lawyer, who may be
greater in himſelf, than the other can be
with all his Trappings.</p>
                  <p>An unconteſted Superiority in any Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
will have the better of any diſtinct Name
that Authority can put upon it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if ever ſuch an unnatural Method
ſhould be introduc'd, it is then that <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall</hi>
might be ſaid to ſtand upon
its Head, and though Juſtice it ſelf can
never be ſo, yet the Adminiſtration of
it would be rendred Ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>A Judge has ſuch power lodg'd in him,
that the King will never be thought to
have choſen well, where the voice of
Mankind has not before-hand recommended
the Man to his Station; when Men are
made Judges of what they do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
the World cenſures ſuch a Choice,
not out of ill will to the Men, but fear to
themſelves.</p>
                  <p>If the King had the ſole power of chuſing
Phyſicians, Men would tremble to ſee Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers
preferred, yet the neceſſity of taking
Phyſick from a Doctor, is generally not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52156:61"/>
ſo great as that of receiving Juſtice from
a Judge; and yet the Inferences will be
very ſevere in ſuch caſes, for either it will
be thought that ſuch Men bought what
they were not able to deſerve, or which
is as bad, that Obedience ſhall be look'd
upon as a better Qualification in a Judge,
than Skill or Integrity, when ſuch ſacred
things as the Laws are not only touch'd,
but guided by prophane hands; Men will
fear that out of the Tree of the Law,
from whence we expect Shade and Shelter,
ſuch Workmen will make Cudgels to beat
us with, or rather that they will turn the
Canon upon our Properties, that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with them for their Defence.</p>
                  <p>To ſee the Laws Mangled, Diſguiſed,
Speak quite another Language than their

Office of deſtroying them; and
notwithſtanding their Innocence in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to be made the worſt Inſtruments
that the moſt refined Villany can make uſe
of, will raiſe Mens Anger above the power
of laying it down again, and tempt them
to follow the Evil Examples given them
of Judging without Hearing, when ſo-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by their deſire of Revenge. Our
<hi>Trimmer</hi> therefore, as he thinks the Laws
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52156:61"/>
are Jewels, ſo he believes they are no
better ſet, than in the conſtitution of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, if rightly underſtood,
and carefully preſerved.</p>
                  <p>It would be too great Partiality to ſay
they are perfect or liable to no Objection;
ſuch things are not of this world; but if
they have more Excellencies and fewer
Faults than any other we know, it is
enough to recommend them to one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem.</p>
                  <p>The Diſpute, which is a greater Beauty,
a Monarchy or a Common-wealth, has
laſted long between their contending Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and (they have behav'd themſelves ſo like
Lovers, who in good Manners muſt be out
of their Wits,) who uſed ſuch Figures to
exalt their own Idols on either ſide,. and
ſuch angry Aggravations, to reproach one
another in the Conteſt, that moderate men
have in all times ſmil'd upon this eagerneſs,
and thought it differ'd very little from a
downright Frenzy: we in <hi>England,</hi> by a
happy uſe of the Controverſie, conclude
them both in the wrong, and reject them
from being our Pattern, not taking the
words in the utmoſt extent, which is a
thing, that Monarchy, leaves men no
Liberty, and a Common-wealth ſuch a one,
as allows them no Quiet.</p>

We think that a wiſe Mean, between
theſe barbarous Extreams, is that which
ſelf-Preſervation ought to dictate, to our
Wiſhes; and we may ſay we have attained
to this Mean in a greater meaſure, than
any Nation now in being, or perhaps any
we have read of; tho never ſo much Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
for the Wiſdom or Felicity of their
Conſtitutions: We take from one the too
great power of doing hurt, and yet leave
enough to govern and protect us; we take
from the other, the Confuſion, the Parity,
the Animoſities, and the Licenſe, and yet
reſerve a due care of ſuch a Liberty, as
may conſiſt with Mens Allegiance; but it
being hard, if not impoſſible, to be exactly
even, our Government has much the
ſtronger Biaſs towards Monarchy, which
by the general Conſent and Practiſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
ſeems to have Advantage in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute

Form of Government requires ſuch a ſpirit

Monarchy is lik'd by the People, for
the Bells and the Tinſel, the outward
Pomp and Gilding, and there muſt be
milk for Babes, ſince the greateſt part
of Mankind are, and ever will be included
in that Liſt; and it is approv'd by wiſe
and thinking Men, (all Circumſtances and
Objections impartially conſider'd) that it
has ſo great an advantage above all other
Forms, when the Adminiſtration of that
Power falls in good hands; that all other
Governments look out of Countenance,
when they are ſet in Competition with it.
<hi>Lycurgus</hi> might have ſav'd himſelf the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of making Laws, if either he had been
Immortal, or that he could have ſecur'd to
Poſterity, a ſucceeding Race of Princes like
himſelf; his own Example was a better Law,
than he could with all his skill tell how to
make; ſuch a Prince is a Living Law, that
dictates to his Subjects, whoſe thoughts in
that caſe never riſe above their Obedience,
the Confidence they have in the Vertue and
Knowledge of the maſter, preventing the
Scruples and Apprehenſions to which Men
are naturally inclin'd, in relation to thoſe
that govern them; ſuch a Magiſtrate is the
Life and Soul of Juſtice, whereas the Law
is but a Body and a dead one too, without
his Influence to give it warmth and vigour,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52156:63"/>
and by the irreſiſtible Power of his Virtue,
he do's ſo reconcile Dominion and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that all diſputes between them are
ſilenced and ſubdued, and indeed no Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
can be Perfect and Abſolute without
exception, but where the Prince is Superior
by his Vertue, as well as by his Character
and his Power; ſo that to ſcrew out Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and unlimited Power, is a plain dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution
to a Prince that Nature has made
Great, and who had better make himſelf a
glorious Example to Poſterity, than borrow
an Authority from Dark Records, raiſed
out of the Grave, which beſides their Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſage,
have always in them matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
and Debate, and it may be; affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the inſtances are very rare of
Princes having the worſt in the diſpute with
their People, if they were Eminent for
Juſtice in time of Peace, or Conduct in
time of War, ſuch advantage the Crown
giveth to thoſe who adorn it by their own
Perſonal Vertues.</p>
                  <p>But ſince for the greater Honour of
Good and wiſe Princes, and the better to
ſet off their Character by the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
Heaven has decreed there muſt be
a mixture, and that ſuch as are perverſe
and inſufficient, or at leaſt both, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to have their equal turns in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52156:63"/>
Government of the World, and beſides,
that the Will of Man is ſo various, and
ſo unbounded a thing, and ſo fatal too when
joined with Power miſapply'd; it is no
wonder if thoſe who are to be govern'd,
are unwilling to have ſo dangerous as
well as ſo uncertain a Standard of their
Obedience.</p>
                  <p>There muſt be therefore Rules and Laws:
for want of which, or at leaſt the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them, it was as Capital for a
Man to ſay that <hi>Nero</hi> did not play well up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lute, as to commit Treaſon, or
Blaſpheme the Gods. And even <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>
himſelf had like to have loſt his Life, for
ſleeping whilſt he ſhould have attended and
admir'd that Emperours Impertinence upon
the Stage. There is a wantonneſs in great
Power that Men are generally too apt to
be corrupted with, and for that Reaſon,
a wiſe Prince, to prevent the temptation
ariſing from common frailty, would chooſe
to Govern by Rules for his own Sake, as
well as for his Peoples, ſince it only ſecures
him from Errors, and does not leſſen the
real Authority, that a good Magiſtrate
would care to be poſſeſs'd of; for if the
Will of a Prince is contrary either to Reaſon
it ſelf, or to the univerſal Opinion of his
Subjects, the Law by a kind reſtraint reſcues
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52156:64"/>
him from a diſeaſe that would undo him;
if his will on the other ſide is reaſonable
or well directed, that Will immediately
becomes a Law, and he is arbitrary by an
eaſie and natural Conſequence, without
taking pains, or overturning the World
for it.</p>
                  <p>If Princes conſider Laws as things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
on them, they have the appearance
of Fetters of Iron, but to ſuch as would
make them their choice as well as their
practice, they are Chains of Gold; and in
that reſpect are Ornaments, as in others
they are a defence to them, and by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,
not improper for God's Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
upon Earth; as our Maker never
Commands our obedience to any thing, that
as reaſonable Creatures we ought not to
make our own Election; ſo a good and
wiſe Governour, tho' all Laws were abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd,
would by the voluntary direction of
his own Reaſon, do without reſtraint the
very ſame things that they would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> thinks that the King and
Kingdom ought to be one Creature, not
to be ſeparated in their Political Capacity;
and when either of them undertake to act
a part, it is like the crawling of Worms
after they are cut in pieces, which cannot
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52156:64"/>
be a laſting motion, the whole Creature
not ſtirring at a time. If the Body has
a dead Palſie, the Head cannot make it
move; and God hath not yet delegated
ſuch a healing power to Princes, as that
they can in a moment ſay to a Languiſhing
People oppreſs'd and in deſpair, take up
your Beds and walk.</p>
                  <p>The Figure of a King, is ſo comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and exalted a thing, that it is a kind
of degrading him to lodge that power ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately
in his own Natural Perſon, which
can never be ſafely or naturally great, but
where the People are ſo united to him as
to be Fleſh of his Fleſh, and Bone of his
Bone; for when he is reduc'd to the ſingle
definition of a man, he ſinks into ſo low
a Character, that it is a temptation upon
Mens Allegiance, and an impairing that
veneration which is neceſſary to preſerve
their Duty to him; whereas a Prince who is
ſo joined to his people that they ſeem to
be his Limbs, rather than his Subjects,
Cloathed with Mercy and Juſtice rightly
apply'd in their ſeveral places, his Throne
ſupported by Love as well as by Power,
and the warm wiſhes of his devoted Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
like never-failing Incenſe, ſtill aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
towards him, looks ſo like the beſt
Image we can frame to our ſelves of God
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52156:65"/>
Almighty, that men would have much
ado not to fall down and worſhip him;
and would be much more tempted to the
Sin of Idolatry, than to that of Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is of Opinion, that there
muſt be ſo much Dignity inſeparably an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to the Royal Function, as may
be ſufficient to ſecure it from inſolence
and contempt; and there muſt be Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions
from the Throne, like kind ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from Heaven, that the Prince may look
ſo much the more like God Almighty's Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon Earth; for power without love
hath a terrifying aſpect, and the Worſhip
which is paid to it is like that which the
<hi>Indians</hi> give out of fear to Wild Beaſts and
Devils: he that fears God only becauſe
there is an Hell, muſt wiſh there were no
God; and he who fears the King, only
becauſe he can puniſh, muſt wiſh there
were no King; ſo that without a principle
of Love, there can be no true Allegiance,
and there muſt remain perpetual Seeds of
Reſiſtance againſt a power that is built
upon ſuch an unnatural Foundation, as
that of fear and terrour. All force is a
kind of ſoul-Play, and whoſoever aims at
it himſelf, does by implication allow it to
thoſe he plays with; ſo that there will be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52156:65"/>
ever Matter prepared in the minds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
when they are provoked, and the
Prince, to ſecure himſelf muſt live in the
midſt of his own Subjects, as if he were in
a Conquer'd Country, raiſe Arms as if he
were immediately to meet or reſiſt an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion,
and all this while ſleep as unquietly
from the fear of the Remedies, as he did
before from that of the Diſeaſe; it being
hard for him to forget, that more Princes
have been deſtroyed by their Guards than
by their People; and that even at the time
when the Rule was <hi>Quod Principi placuit
Lex eſto:</hi> the Armies and <hi>Praetorian</hi> Bands
which were the Inſtruments of that unruly
Power, were frequently the means made
uſe of to deſtroy them who had it. There
will ever be this difference between God
and his Vicegeren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, that God is ſtill above the
Inſtruments he uſes, and out of the danger
of receiving hurt from them; but Princes
can never lodge Power in any hands, which
may not at ſome time turn it back upon
them; for tho' it is poſſible enough for a
King to have power to ſatisfy his Ambition;
yet no Kingdom has Money enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the avarice of under-Work-men, who
learn from that Prince who will exact more
than belongs to him, to expect from him
much more than they deſerve, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52156:66"/>
angry upon the firſt diſappointment,
they are the Devils which grow terrible
to the Conjurers themſelves who brought
them up, and can't ſend them down again;
And beſides that there can be no laſting
Radical Security, but where the Governed
are ſatisfied with the Governours. It muſt
be a Dominion very unpleaſant to a Prince
of an elevated Mind, to impoſe an abject
and ſordid ſervility, inſtead of receiving
the willing Sacrifice of Duty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The braveſt Princes in all times,
who were uncapable of any other kind of
fear, have fear'd to grieve their own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
ſuch a fear is a glory, and in this ſenſe
'tis an infamy not to be a Coward: So that
the miſtaken Heroes who are void of this
generous kind of fear, need no other ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
to compleat their ill Characters.</p>
                  <p>When a Deſpotick Prince has bruiſed
all his Subjects with a ſlaviſh Obedience,
all the force he can uſe cannot ſubdue his
own fears; Enemies of his own Creation, to
which he can never be reconciled, it being
impoſſible to do injuſtice and not to fear
Revenge: there is no cure for this fear, but
the not deſerving to be hurt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Prince who does not allow his
thoughts to ſtray beyond the Rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
has always the bleſſing of an inward
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52156:66"/>
quiet and aſſurance, as a natural effect of
his good Meaning to his People, and tho
he will not neglect due precautions to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
himſelf in all Events, yet he is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of entertaining vain and remote ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
of thoſe, of whom he reſolves never
to deſerve ill.</p>
                  <p>It is very hard for a Prince to fear Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
who neither does, nor intends to do
any thing to provoke it; therefore too
great a diligence in the Governours, to
raiſe and improve dangers and fears from
the People, is no very good Symptom, and
naturally begets an inference that they
have thoughts of putting their Subjects Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to a Tryal; and therefore not
without ſome Reaſon fear before hand, that
the Irregularities they intend, may raiſe
Men to a Reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> thinks it no advantage to
a Government, to endeavour the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all kind of Right which may remain
in the Body of the People, or to employ
ſmall Authors in it, whoſe Officiouſneſs or
want of Money may encourage them to
write, tho' it is not very eaſie to have Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
equal to ſuch a Subject; they forget
that in their too high ſtrained Arguments
for the Rights of Princes, they very often
plead againſt humane Nature, which will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52156:67"/>
always give a Biaſs to thoſe Reaſons which
ſeem of her ſide; it is the People that Reads
thoſe Books, and it is the People that muſt
judge of them; and therefore no Maxims
ſhould be laid down for the Right of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
to which there can be any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Objection; for the World has an
Intereſt, and for that Reaſon is more than
ordinary diſcerning to find out the weak
ſides of ſuch Arguments as are intended
to do them hurt; and it is a diminution
to a Government, to Promote or Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
ſuch well affected miſtakes which are
turned upon it with diſadvantage, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are detected and expos'd; and
Naturally the too earneſt Endeavours to
take from Men the Right they have, tempt
them, by the Example to Claim that which
they have not.</p>
                  <p>In Power, as in moſt other things, the
way for Princes to keep it, is not to graſp
more than their Arms can well hold; the
nice and unneceſſary enquiring into theſe
things, or the Licenſing ſome Books, and
ſuppreſſing ſome others without ſufficient
Reaſon to Juſtifie the doing either, is ſo
far from being an Advantage to a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it expoſes it to the Cenſure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Partial and to the ſuſpicion, of having
ſome hidden deſigns to be carried on by
theſe unuſual methods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52156:67"/>
When all is ſaid, there is a Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of State, and undefinable thing, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Common Good of Mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which is immortal, and in all Changes and
Revolutions, ſtill preſerves its Original
Right of ſaving a Nation, when the Letter
of the Law perhaps would deſtroy it; and
by whatſoever means it moves, carrieth a
Power with it, that admits of no oppoſition,
being ſupported by Nature, which inſpires
an immediate conſent at ſome Critical times
into every individual Member, to that
which viſibly tendeth to preſervation of the
whole; and this being ſo, a Wiſe Prince
inſtead of Controverting the right of this
Reaſon of State, will by all means endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it may be of his ſide, and then he
will be ſecure.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> cannot conceive that the
Power of any Prince can be laſting, but
where 'tis built upon the foundation of his
own unborrowed vertue, he muſt not only
be the firſt Mover and the Fountain, from
whence the great Acts of State originally
flow, but he muſt be thought ſo to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that they may preſerve their veneration
for him; he muſt be jealous of his Power,
and not impart ſo much of it to any about
him, as that he may ſuffer an Eclipſe by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52156:68"/>
He cannot take too much care to keep
himſelf up, for when a Prince is thought
to be led by thoſe, with whom he ſhould
onely adviſe, and that the Commands he
gives are tranſmitted through him, and
are not of his own growth; the World
will look upon him as a Bird adorned with
Feathers that are not his own, or conſider
him rather as an Engine than a living
Creature; beſides, 'twould be a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
for a Prince to fear a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and at the ſame time create one
himſelf, be delegating ſuch a Power to any
Number of Men near him, as is inconſiſtent
with the Figure of a Monarch: it is the
worſt kind of Co-ordination the Crown can
ſubmit to; for it is the exerciſe of Power
that draws the reſpect along with it, and
when that is parted with, the bare Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a King is not ſufficient to keep it
up; but tho' it is a diminution to a Prince,
to parcel out ſo liberally his Power amongſt
his Favourites, it's worſe to divide with
any other Man, and to bring himſelf in
Competition with a ſingle Rival; a Partner
in Government is ſo unnatural a thing, that
it is a ſquint-ey'd Allegiance that muſt be
paid to ſuch a double bottom'd Monarchy.
The two Czars of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> are an Example
that the more civiliz'd part of the World
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52156:68"/>
will not be proud to follow, whatſoever
Gloſs may be put upon this method, by
thoſe to whom it may be of ſome uſe, the
Prince will do well to remember, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the Story of certain Men who
had ſet up a Statue in Honour of the Sun,
yet in a very little time they turned their
backs to the Sun, and their Faces to the
Statue.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Myſtical Unions are better plac'd
in the other World, than they are in this,
and we ſhall have much ado to find, that
in a Monarchy Gods Vicegerency is dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
to more Heads than that which is
anointed.</p>
                  <p>Princes may lend ſome of their Light to
make another ſhine, but they muſt ſtill
preſerve the ſuperiority of being the brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Planet, and when it happens that the
Reverſion is in Mens Eyes, there is more
care neceſſary to keep up the Dignity of
Poſſeſſions, that Men may not forget who
is King, either out of their hopes or fears
who ſhall be. If the Sun ſhou'd part with
all his Light to any of the Stars, the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
would not know where to find their
God, after he had ſo depoſed himſelf, and
would make the Light (where-ever it went)
the Object of their Worſhip.</p>

All Uſurpation is alike upon Soveraignty,
its no matter from what hand it comes;
and Crowned Heads are to be the more
Circumſpect, in reſpect Mens thoughts are
naturally apt to ramble beyond what is
preſent, they love to work at a diſtance,
and in their greedy Expectations; which
their minds may be fill'd with of a new
Maſter, the old one may be left to look
a little out of Countenance.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> owns a Paſſion for liberty,
yet ſo reſtrained, that it does not in the
leaſt impair or taint his Allegiance, he
thinks it hard for a Soul that does not
love Liberty, ever to raiſe it ſelf to another
World he takes it to be the foundation of all
vertue, and the only ſeaſoning that gives
a reliſh to life, and tho' the lazineſs of a
ſlaviſh ſubjection, has its Charms for the
more groſs and earthly part of Mankind,
yet to men made of a better ſort of Clay,
all that the World can give without Liberty
has no taſte; it is true, nothing is ſold
ſo cheap by unthinking men, but that does
no more leſſen the real value of it, than a
Country Fellows Ignorance does that of
a Diamond, in ſelling it for a Pot of Ale.
Liberty is the Miſtreſs of Mankind, ſhe
has powerful Charms which do ſo dazzle us,
that we find Beauties in her which perhaps
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52156:69"/>
are not there, as we do in other Miſtreſſes; yet
if ſhe was not a Beauty, the World would not
run mad for her; therefore ſince the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deſire of it ought not to be reſtrain'd, and
that even the unreaſonable deſire of it cannot
be entirely ſuppreſs'd, thoſe who would take it
away from a People poſſeſſed of it, are likely to
fail in the attempting, or be very unquiet in
the keeping of it.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> admires our bleſſed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
in which Dominion and Liberty
are ſo well reconciled; it gives to the Prince
the glorious Power of commanding Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and to the Subject, the ſatisfaction
of ſeeing the Power ſo lodged, as that their
Liberties are ſecure; it do's not allow the
Crown ſuch a Ruining Power, as that no
graſs can grow where e're it treads, but a
Cheriſhing and Protecting Power; ſuch a
one as hath a grim Aſpect only to the
offending Subjects, but is the joy and the
Pride of all the good ones; their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
being ſo bound up in it, as to engage
them to defend and ſupport it; and tho in
ſome inſtances the King is reſtrain'd yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the Government can move with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him; our Laws make a diſtinction
between Vaſſalage and Obedience; between
devouring Prerogatives, and a licentious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable
Freedom: and as of all the

                  <p>Our Government is in a juſt proportion,
no Tympany, no unnatural ſwelling either

and from all objections, no doubt there
have been fatal Inſtances of its Sickneſs,

theſe ſtruglings which are natural to all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

would not incite Men to wiſh for ſuch
a Government, but rather to acknowledge
the happineſs of our own, under which we
enjoy all the Privilege Reaſonable Men can
deſire, and avoid all the Miſeries many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are ſubject to; ſo that our <hi>Trimmer</hi>
would keep it with all its faults, and does
as little forgive thoſe who give the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of breaking it, as he does thoſe that take it.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is a Friend to Parliaments,
notwithſtanding all their faults, and exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which of late have given ſuch matter
of Objection to them; he thinks that tho'
they may at ſometimes be troubleſome to
Authority, yet they add the greateſt
ſtrength to it under a wiſe Adminiſtration;
he believes no Government is perfect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
a kind of Omnipotence reſide in it, to
exerciſe upon great Occaſions: Now this
cannot be obtained by force alone upon
People, let it be never ſo great, there muſt
be their conſent too, or elſe a Nation
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52156:72"/>
moves only by being driven, a ſluggiſh and
conſtrained Motion, void of that Life and
Vigour which is neceſſary to produce great
things, whereas the virtual Conſent of the
whole being included in their Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and the King giving the ſanction to
the united ſenſe of the People, every Act
done by ſuch an Authority, ſeems to be
an effect of their choice as well as a part
of their Duty; and they do with an eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
of which Men are uncapable whilſt
under a force, execute whatſoever is ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
as their own Wills, better explained
by Parliament, rather than from the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of incurring the Penalty of the Law
for omiting it, and by means of this Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Omnipotence, what ever Sap or Juice
there is in a Nation, may be to the laſt
drop produc'd, whilſt it riſes naturally
from the Root; whereas all power exercis'd
without conſent, is like the giving Wounds
and Gaſhes, and tapping a Tree at unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Times, for the preſent occaſion,
which in a very little time muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
it.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> believes, that by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of our Situation, there can hardly
any ſuch ſudden Diſeaſe come upon us,
but that the King may have time enough
left to conſult with his Phyſicians in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52156:72"/>
pretences indeed may be made, but
a real neceſſity ſo preſſing, that no delay
is to be admitted, is hardly to be imagin'd,
and it will be neither eaſie to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of any ſuch thing for the time paſt,
or reaſonable to Preſume it will ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
for the time to come: but if that
ſtrange thing ſhould fall out, our <hi>Trimmer</hi>
is not ſo ſtreight-lac'd, as to let a Nation
die, or to be ſtifled, rather than it ſhould be
help'd by any but the proper Officers. The
Caſes themſelves will bring the Remedies
along with them; and he is not afraid to
allow that in order to its preſervation, there
is a hidden Power in Government, which
would be loſt if it was deſigned, a certain
Myſtery, by virtue of which a Nation
may at ſome Critical times be ſecur'd from
Ruine, but then it muſt be kept as a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery;
it is rendred uſeleſs when touch'd by
unskilfull hands: and no Government ever
had, or deſerv'd to have that Power, which
was ſo unwary as to anticipate their claim
to it: Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> cannot help thinking
it had been better, if the Triennial Act had
been obſerv'd; becauſe 'tis the Law, and he
would not have the Crown, by ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
teach the Nation to break it; all
irregularity is catching, it has a Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in it, eſpecially in an Age, ſo much
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52156:73"/>
enclin'd to follow ill Patterns than good
ones.</p>
                  <p>He would have a Parliament, becauſe 'tis
an Eſſential part of the Conſtitution, even
without the Law, it being the only Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in extraordinary Caſes, in which there
would be otherwiſe no Remedy, and there
can be no greater Soleciſm in Government,
than a failure of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>He would have had one, becauſe nothing
elſe can unite and heal us, all other Means
are meer Shifts and Projects, Houſes of
Cards, to be blown down with the leaſt
Breath, and cannot reſiſt the Difficulties
which are ever preſum'd in things of this
kind; and he would have had one, becauſe
it might have done the King good, and
could not poſſibly have done him hurt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his conſent, which in that Caſe is not
to be ſuppoſed, and thereſore for him to
fear it, is ſo ſtrange and ſo little to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
that the Reaſons can never be
preſum'd to grow in our Soyl, or to thrive
in it when Tranſplanted from any other
Country; and no doubt there are ſuch irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible
Arguments for calling a Parliament,
and tho it might, be deny'd to the unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly
mutinous Petitions of men, that are
malicious and diaffected, it will be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the ſoft and obſequious Murmurs of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52156:73"/>
his Majeſty's beſt Subjects, and there will
be ſuch Retorick in their ſilent Grief, that
it will at laſt prevail againſt the Artifices of
thoſe, who either out of Guilt or Intereſt,
are afraid to throw themſelves upon their
Country, knowing how ſcurvily they have
uſed it; that day of Judgment will come,
tho we know neither the day nor the hour.
And our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would live ſo as to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for it, with full aſſurance in the mean
time, that the lamenting Voice of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cannot long be reſiſted, and that a Prince
who could ſo eaſily forgive his People when
they had been in the wrong, cannot fail
to hear them when they are in the right.</p>

                     <p>REligion has ſuch a Superiority above
other things, and that indiſpenſable
Influence upon all Mankind, that it is as
neceſſary to our Living Happy in this
World, as it is to our being Sav'd in the
next, without it man is an abandon'd
Creature, one of the worſt Beaſts Nature
hath produc'd, and fit ònly for the Society
of Wolves and Bears; therefore in all Ages
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52156:74"/>
it has been the Foundation of Government:
and tho' falſe Gods have been impos'd upon
the Credulous part of the World, yet they
were Gods ſtill in their Opinion, and the
Awe and Reverence Men had to them and
their Oracles, kept them within bounds
towards one another, which the Laws with
all their Authority could never have effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without the help of Religion; the Laws
would not be able to ſubdue the perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Mens Wills, which are Wild Beaſts,
and require a double Chain to keep them
down; for this Reaſon 'tis ſaid, That it
is not a ſufficient ground to make War
upon a Neighbouring State, becauſe they
are of another Religion, let it be never ſo
differing: yet if they Worſhip'd nor Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd
any Deity at all, they may
be Invaded as Publick Enemies of Mankind,
becauſe they reject the only thing that can
bind them to live well with one another;
the conſideration of Religion is ſo
twiſted with that of Government, that it
is never to be ſeparated, and tho the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of it ought to be Eternal and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable,
yet the Terms and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Diſcipline, are to be ſuited to

ſo that they may keep men in a willing

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52156:74"/>
the World by nice diſputes, which
can never be of equal moment with the
publick Peace.</p>
                     <p>Our Religion here in <hi>England</hi> ſeems to
be diſtinguiſhed by a peculiar effect of God
Almighty's goodneſs, in permiting it to be
introduc'd, or rather reſtored, by a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Method than the Circumſtances of
moſt other Reformed Churches, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
them to do, in relation to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and the Dignity with which it has
ſupported it ſelf ſince, and the great Men
our Church hath produced, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it to the eſteem of all Proteſtants
at leaſt: Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is very partial to it,
for theſe Reaſons, and many more, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
that it may preſerve its due Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Authority? ſo far he is from wiſhing
it oppreſſed by the unreaſonable and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cavils of thoſe who take pains to raiſe
Objections againſt it.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtions will then be, how and
by what Methods this Church ſhall beſt
ſupport it ſelf (the preſent Circumſtances
conſider'd) in relation to Diſſenters of all
ſorts: I will firſt lay this for a ground,
That as there can be no true Religion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Charity, ſo there can be no true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
prudence without bearing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion:
This Principle does not extend
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52156:75"/>
to oblige the Church always to yield to
thoſe who are diſpoſed to Conteſt with
her, the expediency of doing it is to be
conſidered and determined according to
the occaſion, and this leads me to lay open
the thoughts of our <hi>Trimmer,</hi> in reference
firſt, to the Proteſtants, and then to the
Popiſh Recuſants.</p>
                     <p>What has lately hapned among us, makes
an Apology neceſſary for ſaying any thing
that looks like favour towards a ſort of
Men who have brought themſelves under
ſuch a diſadvantage.</p>
                     <p>The late Conſpiracy hath ſuch broad
Symptoms of the diſaffection of the whole
Party, that upon the firſt reflections, while
our thoughts are warm, it would almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
us to put them out of the protection
of our good Nature, and to think that the
Chriſtian Indulgence with our compaſſion
for other Mens Sufferings, cannot eaſily
deny, ſeems not only to be forfeited by the
ill appearances that are againſt them, but
even becomes a Crime when it is ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied;
yet for all this, upon ſecond and
cooler thoughts, moderate Men will not be
ſo ready to involve a whole Party in the
guilt of a few, and to admit inferences and
Preſumptions to be Evidence in a Caſe,
where the Sentence muſt be ſo heavy, as it

Principle grounded upon Moral Vertue,
can never let it be clearly extinguiſhed
by the moſt repeated Provocations; if a
right thing agreeable to Nature and good
Senſe takes root in the heart of a Man,
that is impartial and unbyaſs'd, no outward.
Circumſtances can ever deſtroy it; it's true,
the degrees of a Mans Zeal for the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it may be differing, faults of other
Men, the conſideration of the publick, and the

ſuppreſs the exerciſe of that, which
in general Propoſition may be reaſonable,
but ſtill whatever is ſo will inevitably grow
and ſpring up again, having a Foundation
in Nature, which is never to be deſtroy'd.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> therefore endeavours to
ſeparate the deteſtation of thoſe who had
either a hand or a thought in the late Plot,
from the Principle of Prudential as well as
Chriſtian Charity towards Mankind, and
for that reaſon would fain uſe the means
of reclaiming ſuch of the Diſſenters as
are not incurable, and even bearing to
a degree thoſe that are as far as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52156:76"/>
with the Publick Intereſt and Security;
he is far from juſtifying an affected ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Communion of the Church,
and even in thoſe that mean well, and
are miſtaken, he looks upon it as a Diſeaſe
that has ſeized upon their Minds, very
troubleſome as well as dangerous, by the
Conſequence it may produce: he does not
go about to excuſe their making it an
indiſpenſable duty, to meet in numbers to
ſay their Prayers, ſuch meetings may prove
miſchievous to the State at leaſt; the Laws
which are the beſt Judges, have determined
that there is danger in them: he has good
nature enough to lament that the perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of a Part ſhould have drawn Rigorous
Laws upon the whole Body of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,
but when they are once made no
private Opinion muſt ſtand in Oppoſition
to them; if they are in themſelves reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they are in that reſpect to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
even without being enjoyned, if
by the Change of Time and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
they ſhould become leſs reaſonable
than when they were firſt made, even then
they are to be obey'd too, becauſe they
are Laws, till they are mended or repealed
by the ſame Authority that Enacted them.</p>
                     <p>He has too much deference to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of our Government, to wiſh for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52156:76"/>
more Prerogative Declarations in favour of
ſcrupulous Men, or to diſpence with Penal
Laws in ſuch manner, or to ſuch an end,
that ſuſpecting Men might with ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
pretend, that ſo hated a thing as Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
could never make way for it ſelf
with any hopes of Succeſs, otherwiſe than
by preparing the deluded World by a falſe
proſpect of Liberty and Indulgence. The
inward Springs and Wheels whereby the
Engine moved, are now ſo fully laid open
and expos'd that it is not ſuppoſable that
ſuch a baffled Experiment ſhould ever be
tryed again, the effect it had at the time,
and the Spirit it raiſed, will not eaſily be
forgotten, and it may be preſum'd the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of it may ſecure us from any
more attempts of that Nature for the future;
we muſt no more break a Law to give Men
eaſe, than we are to Rifle an Houſe with a
devout intention of giving the plunder to
the Poor; in this caſe, our Compaſſion
would be as ill directed, as our Charity in
the other.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort, the veneration due to the Laws
is never to be thrown off, let the pretences
be never ſo ſpecious; yet with all this he
cannot bring himſelf to think, that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
diligence to take the uttermoſt
penalty of Laws, upon the poor offending
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52156:77"/>
Neighbour, is of it ſelf ſuch an all ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
vertue, that without any thing elſe to
recommend Men, it ſhould Entitle them
to all kind of Preferments and Rewards;
he would not detract from the merits of
thoſe who execute the Laws, yet he
cannot think ſuch a piece of ſervice as this,
can entirely change the Man, and either
make him a better Divine, or a more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Magiſtrate than he was before, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if it be done with a partial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
hand in Reverence to greater and

                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would have thoſe miſtaken
Men ready to throw themſelves into the
arms of the Church, and he would have
thoſe arms as ready to receive them that ſhall
come to us; he would have no ſupercilious
look to fright thoſe ſtrayed Sheep from
coming into the Fold again; no ill-natur'd
maxims of an Eternal ſuſpicion, or a belief
that thoſe who have once been in the
wrong can never be in the right again;
but a viſible preparation of mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
with joy all the Proſelytes that
come amongſt us, and much greater
earneſtneſs to reclaim than puniſh them:
It is to be confeſſed, there is a great
deal to forgive, a hard task enough for
the Charity of a Church ſo provoked;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52156:77"/>
but that muſt not cut off all hopes of being
reconciled, yet if there muſt be ſome anger
left ſtill, let it break out into a Chriſtian
Revenge, and by being kinder to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Diſobedience than they deſerve, let
the injur'd Church Triumph, by throwing
ſhame and confuſion of face upon them;
there ſhould not always be Storms and
Thunder, a clear Sky would ſometime
make the Church look more like Heaven,
and would do more towards the reclaiming
thoſe wanderers, than a perpetual terrour,
which ſeemed to have no intermiſſion; for
there is in many, and particularly in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
Men,</hi> a miſtaken pleaſure, in reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the dictates of Rigorous Authority;
a Stomach that riſeth, againſt a hard impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
nay, in ſome, raiſe even a luſt in
ſuffering from a wrong point of Honour,
which does not want the applauſe, from
the greater part of Mankind, who have
not learnt to diſtinguiſh; conſtancy will be
thought a virtue even where it is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake;
and the ill Judging World will be
apt to think that Opinion moſt right,
which produces the greateſt number of
thoſe who are willing to ſuffer for it; all
this is prevented, and falls to the ground,
by uſing well-timed Indulgence; and the
ſtubborn Adverſary who values himſelf upon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52156:78"/>
his Reſiſtance whilſt he is oppreſs'd, yields
inſenſibly to kind Methods, when they are
apply'd to him, and the ſame Man natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
melts into Conformity, who perhaps
would never have been beaten into it. We
may be taught by the Compaſſion that
attendeth the moſt Criminal Men when
they are Condemned, that Faults are much
more natural things than Puniſhments, and
that even the moſt neceſſary acts of ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
do ſome kind of violence to our Nature,
whoſe Indulgence will not be confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ſtrait bounds of inexorable Juſtice;
ſo that this ſhould be an Argument for
gentleneſs, beſides that it is the likelieſt
way to make theſe Men aſham'd of their

it.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would have the Clergy

there may be in ſome of them a too great
eagerneſs to extend the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
which tho it may be well intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet the ſtraining of it too high has an

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52156:78"/>
employ'd, that the World draws inferences
from it, which do the Church no ſervice.</p>
                     <p>He is troubled to ſee Men of all ſides
ſick of a Calenture of a miſtaken Devotion,
and it ſeems to him that the devout Fire
of miſtaken Charity with which the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Chriſtians were inflam'd, is long ſince
extinguiſh'd, and inſtead of it a devouring
Fire of Anger and Perſecution breaks out in
the World; we wrangle now one with
another about Religion till the Blood comes,
whilſt the Ten Commandments have no
more authority with us, than if they were
ſo many obſolete Laws or Proclamations
out of date; he thinks that a Nation will
hardly be mended by Principles of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where Morality is made a Hereſy;
and therefore as he believes-Devotion miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
when it gets into a Conventicle, he
concludes that Loyalty is ſo too, when
lodg'd in a Drunken Club; thoſe Vertues
deſerve a better Seat of Empire, and they
are degraded, when ſuch Men undertake
their defence, as have too great need of an
Apology themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> wiſhes that ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
may go along with the Zeal on the
right ſide, and that thoſe who are in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Pulpit, would quote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at leaſt ſo
often the Authority of the Scriptures as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52156:79"/>
they do that of the State; there are many
who borrow too often Arguments from
the Government; to uſe againſt their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
and neglect thoſe that are more
proper, and would be more powerful; a
Divine grows leſs, and puts a diminution
on his own Character, when he quoteth
any Law but that of God Almighty, to
get the better of thoſe who conteſt with
him; and it is a ſign of a decay'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
when Nature with good diet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expel noxious Humours without calling
Foreign Drugs to her Aſſiſtance; So it looks,
like want of health in a Church, when
inſtead of depending upon the power of that
Truth which it holds, and the good Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of them that teach it, to ſupport it
ſelf, and to ſuppreſs Errors, it ſhould have
a perpetual recourſe to the ſecular Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and even upon the ſlighteſt occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> has his Objections to the
too buſy diligence, and to the overdoing
of ſome of the diſſenting Clergy, and he
does as little approve of thoſe of our
Church, who wear God Almighty's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
as ſome old Warders in the <hi>Tower</hi>
do the King's, who do nothing in their
place but receive their Wages for it; he
thinks that the Liberty of the late times
gave men ſo much Light, and diffuſed it ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52156:79"/>
univerſally amongſt the people, that they
are not now to be dealt with, as they
might have been in Ages of leſs enquiry;
and therefore in ſome well choſen and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloved Auditories, good reſolute Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
back'd with Authority may prevail,
yet generally Men are become ſo good
Judges of what they hear, that the Clergy
ought to be very wary how they go about
to impoſe upon their Underſtandings, which
are grown leſs humble than they were in
former times, when the Men in black had
made Learning ſuch a ſin in the Laity, that
for fear of offending, they made a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of being able to read; but now the
World is grown ſawcy, and expects Reaſons,
and good ones too, before they give up
their own Opinions to other Mens Dictates,
tho never ſo Magiſterially deliver'd to them.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is far from approving
the Hypocriſie, which ſeems to be the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Vice amongſt ſome of the Diſſenting
Clergy, he thinks it the moſt provoking
ſin Men can be guilty of, in Relation to
Heaven, and yet (which may ſeem ſtrange)
that very ſin which ſhall deſtroy the Soul
of the Man who preaches, may help to ſave
thoſe of the Company that hear him, and
even thoſe who are cheated by the falſe
Oſtentation of his ſtrictneſs of life, may
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52156:80"/>
by that Pattern be encouraged to the real
Practice of thoſe Chriſtian Vertues which
he does ſo deceitfully profeſs; ſo that the
deteſtation, of this fault may poſſibly be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd
on too far by our own Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
if they think it cannot be enough
expreſs'd without bending the Stick another
way; a dangerous Method, and a worſe
Extream for Men of that Character, who
by going to the outmoſt line of Chriſtian
Liberty, will certainly encourage others to
go beyond it: No Man does leſs approve
the ill-bred Methods of ſome of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in rebuking Authority, who behave
themſelves as if they thought ill manners
neceſſary to Salvation; yet he cannot but
diſtinguiſh and deſire a Mean between the
ſawcyneſs of ſome of the <hi>Scotch Apoſtles,</hi> and
the undecent Courtſhip of ſome of the
Silken Divines, who, one would think,
do practice to bow at the Altar, only to
learn to make the better Legs at Court.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> approves the Principles of
our Church, that Dominion is not founded
in Grace, and that our Obedience is to be
given to a Popiſh King in other things, at
the ſame time that our Compliance with him
in his Religion is to be deny'd; yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but think it a very extraordinary thing
if a Proteſtant Church ſhould by a voluntary
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52156:80"/>
Election, chuſe a Papiſt for their Guardian,
and receive Directions for ſupporting their
Religion, from one who muſt believe it
a Mortal Sin not to endeavour to deſtroy
it; ſuch a refined piece of Breeding would
not ſeem to be very well plac'd in the
Clergy, who will hardly find Precedents to
juſtify ſuch an extravagant piece of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and which is ſo unlike the Primitive
Methods, which ought to be our Pattern;
he hath no ſuch unreaſonable tenderneſs for
any ſorts of Men, as to expect their faults
ſhould not be impartially laid open as often
as they give occaſion for it; and yet he
cannot but ſmile to ſee that the ſame Man,
who ſets up all the Sails of his Rhetorick,
to fall upon Diſſenters; when Popery is to
be handled, he does it ſo gingerly, that he
looketh like an Aſs mumbling of Thiſtles,
ſo afraid he is of letting himſelf looſe where
he may be in danger of letting his Duty get
the better of his Diſcretion.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is far from reliſhing the
impertinent wandrings of thoſe who pour
out long Prayers upon the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and all from their own Stock, which
God knows, for the moſt part is a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Soil, which produces weeds inſtead
of Flowers, and by this means they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Religion it ſelf, rather than promote
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52156:81"/>
Mens Devotions: On the other ſide, there
may be too great Reſtraint put upon
Men, whom God and Nature hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from their Fellow Labourers,
by bleſſing them with a happier Talent,
and by giving them not only good Senſe,
but a powerful Utterance too, has ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
them to guſh out upon the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Auditory, with a mighty ſtream of
Devout and unaffected Eloquence; when
a Man ſo qualified, endued with Learning
too, and above all, adorn'd with a good
Life, breaks out into a warm and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
Prayer before his Sermon, it has
the appearance of a Divine Rapture, he
raiſes and leads the Hearts of the Aſſembly
in another manner, than the moſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
or beſt Studied Form of ſet Words
can ever do; and the Pray-wees, who ſerve
up all their Sermons with the ſame Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
would look like ſo many Statues,
or Men of Straw in the Pulpit, compar'd
With thoſe who ſpeak with ſuch a powerful
Zeal, that men are tempted at the moment
to believe Heaven it ſelf has dictated their
words to 'em.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is not ſo unreaſonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
to the Diſſenters, as to excuſe the
Irregularities of their Complaints, and to
approve their threatning Stiles, which are
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52156:81"/>
ſo ill-ſuited to their Circumſtances as well
as their Duty; he would have them to
ſhew their Grief, and not their Anger to
the Government, and by ſuch a Submiſſion
to Authority, as becomes them, if they
cannot acquieſce in what is impoſed; let
them deſerve a Legiſlative Remedy to their
Sufferings, there being no other way to
give them perfect redreſs; and either to
ſeek it, or pretend to give it by any other
Method, would not only be vain, but Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
too in thoſe that go about it; yet
with all this, there may in the mean time
be a prudential Latitude left, as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of preventing the Laws now in force
againſt them: The Government is in ſome
degree anſwerable for ſuch an Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, as may be free from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of Impartial Judges; and in order to
that, it would be neceſſary that one of
theſe methods be purſued, either to let looſe
the Laws to their utmoſt extent, without
any Moderation or Reſtraint, in which at
leaſt the Equality of the Government would
be without Objection, the Penalties being
exacted without Remiſſion from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters
of all kinds; or if that will not be
done (and indeed there is no Reaſon it
ſhould) there is a neceſſity of ſome Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
to the Proteſtant Diſſenters to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52156:82"/>
that which in Humanity muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to the Papiſts, even without any
leaning towards them, which muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in thoſe who are or ſhall be in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of publick Buſineſs; and it will
follow that, according to our Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the diſtribution of ſuch connivance
muſt be made in ſuch a manner, that the
greateſt part of it may fall on the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
ſide, or elſe the Objections will be ſo
ſtrong, and the Inferences ſo clear, that
the Friends, as well as the Enemies of the
Crown, will be ſure to take hold of them.</p>
                     <p>It will not be ſufficient to ſay that the
Papiſts may be conniv'd at, becauſe they
are good Subjects and that the Proteſtant
Diſſenters, muſt ſuffer becauſe they are ill
ones; theſe general Maxims will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
diſcerning Men, neither will any late
Inſtances make them forget what paſſed
at other times in the World; both ſides
have had their Turns in being good and
ill Subjects. And therefore 'tis eaſie to
imagine what ſuſpicions would ariſe in the
preſent conjuncture, if ſuch a partial Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as this ſhould be impos'd upon us; the
truth is, this Matter ſpeaks ſo much of it ſelf,
that it is not only unneceſſary, but it may be
mannnerly to ſay any more of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52156:82"/>
Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> therefore could wiſh, that
ſince notwithſtanding the Laws which deny
Churches to ſay Maſs in; even not only
the Exerciſe, but alſo the Oſtentation of
Popery is as well or better performed in the
Chappels of ſo many Foreign Miniſters,
where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> openly reſort in ſpight
of Proclamations and Orders of Council,
which are grown to be as harmleſs things
to them, as the Popes Bulls and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
are to Hereticks who are out
of his reach; I ſay he could wiſh that by a
ſeaſonable as well as an equal piece of Juſtice,
there might be ſo much conſideration had
of the Proteſtant Diſſenters, as that there
might be at ſometimes, and at ſome places,

                     <p>Such a skilful hand as this is very Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in our Circumſtances, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

the Papiſts.</head>
                     <p>TO ſpeak of Popery leads me into ſuch
a Sea of Matter, that it is not eaſie
to forbear launching into it, being invited
by ſuch a fruitful Theme, and by a variety
never to be exhauſted; but to confine it
to the preſent Subject, I will only ſay a
ſhort word of the Religion it ſelf; of its
influences here at this time; and of our
<hi>Trimmer</hi>'s Opinion in Relation to our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of living with them.</p>
                     <p>If a Man would ſpeak Maliciouſly of this
Religion, one may ſay it is like thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
where as long as one drop of the
infection remains, there is ſtill danger of
having the whole Maſs of Blood corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by it. In <hi>Swedeland</hi> there was an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
cure, and nothing of Popery heard
of, till Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> (whether mov'd
by Arguments of this or the other World,
may not be good Manners to enquire)
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52156:83"/>
thought fit to change her Religion and
Country, and to live at <hi>Rome,</hi> where ſhe
might find better judges of her Virtues,
and leſs ungentle Cenſures of thoſe Princely
Liberties, to which ſhe was ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
than ſhe left at <hi>Stockholme;</hi> where
the good breeding is as much inferior to
that of <hi>Rome</hi> in general, as the Civility
of the Religion. The Cardinals having
reſcued the Church from thoſe Clowniſh
Methods the Fiſhermen had firſt introduc'd,
and mended that Pattern ſo effectually, that
a Man of that Age, if he ſhould now come
into the World, would not poſſibly know
it.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Denmark</hi> the Reformation was entire;
in ſome States of <hi>Germany,</hi> as well as <hi>Geneva,</hi>
the Cure was univerſal; but in the reſt of
the World where the Proteſtant Religion
took place, the Popiſh humour was too
tough to be totally expell'd, and ſo it was
in <hi>England;</hi> tho' the Change was made
with àll the advantage imaginable to the
Reformation, it being Countenanc'd and
introduc'd by Legal Authority, and by that
means, might have been perhaps as perfect
as in any other Place, if the ſhort Reign
of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, and the ſucceſſion of a
Popiſh Queen had not given ſuch advantage
to that Religion, that it has ſubſiſted ever
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52156:84"/>
ſince under all the hardſhips that have been
put upon it; it has been a ſtrong Compact
Body, and made the more ſo by theſe
Sufferings; it was not ſtrong enough to
prevail, but it was able, with the help of
foreign ſupport, to carry on an Intereſt
which gave the Crown trouble, and to make
a conſiderable (not to ſay dangerous) Figure
in the Nation; ſo much as this could not
have been done without ſome hopes, nor
theſe hopes kept up without ſome reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
grounds: In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time,
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Zeal for their Religion, and the
Revenge for 88, gave warmth to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
here, and above all the Right of the
Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to ſucceed, was while ſhe
lived ſufficient to give them a better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their Affairs: In King <hi>James</hi>'s time
their hopes were ſupported by the Treaty
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Match, and his gentleneſs
towards them, which they were ready to
interpret more in their own Favour, than
was either reaſonable or became them, ſo
little tenderneſs they have, even where it is
moſt due, if the Intereſt of their Religion
comes in competition with it.</p>
                     <p>As for the late King, tho he gave the
moſt glorious Evidence that ever Man did
of his being a Proteſtant, yet, by the more
than ordinary Influence the Queen was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52156:84"/>
thought to have over him, and it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
that the greateſt part of his Anger
was directed againſt the <hi>Puritans,</hi> there
was ſuch an advantage to Men diſpos'd to
ſuſpect, that they were ready to interpret
it a leaning towards Popery, without which
handle it was Morally impoſſible, that the
ill-affected part of the Nation could ever
have ſeduc'd the reſt into a Rebellion.</p>
                     <p>That which help'd to confirm many well
meaning Men in their Miſapprehenſions of
the King, was the long and unuſual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Parliaments; ſo that every year
that paſſed without one, made up a new
Argument to increaſe their Suſpicion, and
made them preſume that the Papiſts had a
principal hand in keeping them off; This
raiſed ſuch Heats in Mens Minds, to think
that Men who were obnoxious to the Laws,
inſtead of being puniſhed, ſhould have Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
enough to ſerve themſelves; even at the
price of deſtroying the Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
that it broke out into a Flame,
which before it could be quenched, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
reduc'd the Nation to Aſhes.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the miſerable Effects of that
unnatural War, none hath been more fatal
to us, than the forcing our Princes to breathe
in another Air, and to receive the early im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of a Foreign Education; the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52156:85"/>
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> towards the King and
the Royal Family, mighty very well tempt
him to think the better of every thing he
found abroad, and might-naturally produce
more gentleneſs, at leaſt, towards a Religion
by which he was hoſpitably received, at the
ſame time that he was thrown off and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
by the Proteſtants, (tho' his own
Subjects) to aggravate the Offence. The
Queen Mother, (as generally Ladies do with
Age) grew moſt devout and earneſt in her
Religion; and beſides, the temporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of getting larger Subſidies from the
<hi>French</hi> Clergy, ſhe had Motives of another
kind, to perſwade her to ſhew her Zeal; and
ſince by the <hi>Roman</hi> Diſpenſatory, a Soul
converted to the Church is a Soveraign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
and lays up a mighty ſtock of merit,
ſhe was ſolicitous to ſecure her ſelf in all
Events, and therefore firſt ſet upon the
Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who depended ſo much
upon her good will, that ſhe might for that
reaſon have been induc'd to believe, the
Conqueſt would not be difficult; but it ſo
fell out, that he either from his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy,
or that he had thoſe near him by
whom he was otherways advis'd, choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to run away from her importunity,
than by ſtaying to bear the continual weight
of it: It is believ'd ſhe had better ſucceſs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52156:85"/>
with another of her Sons, who, if he was
not quite brought off from our Religion,
at leaſt ſuch beginnings were made, as made
them very eaſie to be finiſh'd; his being of
a generous and aſpiring Nature, and in that
reſpect, leſs patient in the drudgery of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
might probably help to recommend a
Church to him, that exempts the Laity
from the vexation of enquiring; perhaps
he might (tho by miſtake) look upon that
Religion as more favourable to the enlarged
Power of Kings, a conſideration which
might have its weight with a young Prince
in his warm blood, and that was brought
up in Arms.</p>
                     <p>I cannot hinder my ſelf from a ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
to conſider with admiration, that
the old Lady of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all her wrinkles,
ſhould yet have Charms, able to ſubdue
great Princes; ſo far from handſome, and
yet ſo imperious; ſo painted, and yet ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending;
after having abus'd, depos'd, and
murther'd ſo many of her Lovers, ſhe ſtill
finds others glad and proud of their now
Chains; a thing ſo ſtrange) to indifferent
Judges, that thoſe who will allow no other
Miracles in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt needs
grant that this is one not to be conteſted;
ſhe ſits in her Shop, and ſells at dear
Rates her Rattles and her Hobby-Horſes,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52156:86"/>
whilſt the deluded World ſtill continues to
furniſh her with Cuſtomers.</p>
                     <p>But whither am I carried with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation?
it is high time to return to my
Text, and to conſider the wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Kings coming home again, led
by the hand of Heaven, and called by the
Voice of his own People, who receiv'd
him, if poſſible, with Joys equal to the
Bleſſing of Peace and Union which his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration
brought along with it; by this
there was an end put to the hopes ſome

leſs happy Circumſtances, to throw him

                     <p>You may be ſure, that among all the

                     <p>To omit other things, the breach of the

the Price of 1200000 pound, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
apply'd to continue the War againſt the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52156:87"/>
                        <hi>Dutch,</hi> than which nothing could be more
unpopular or leſs approved. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the diſcouragements, Popery is a Plant
that may be mowed down, but the Root
will ſtill remain, and in ſpite of the Laws,
it will ſprout up and grow again; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if it ſhould happen that there ſhould be
Men in Power, who in weeding it out of
our Garden, will take care to Cheriſh and
keep it alive; and tho' the Law for exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them from Places of Truſt was tolerably
kept as to their outward Form, yet there
were many Circumſtances, which being
improved by the quick-ſighted Malice of
ill affected Men, did help to keep up the
World in their ſuſpicions, and to blow up
Jealouſies to ſuch a height both in and out
of Parliament, that the remembrance of
them is very unpleaſant, and the Example
ſo extravagant, that it is to be hop'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in our Age like it will be re-attempted;
but to come cloſer to the Caſe in queſtion
in this Condition we ſtand with the Papiſts,
what ſhall now be done according to our
<hi>Trimmer</hi>'s Opinion, in order to the better
Bearing this grievance, ſince as I have ſaid
before, there is no hopes of being entirely
free from it; Papiſts we muſt have among
us, and if their Religion keep them from
bringing honey to the Hive, let the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52156:87"/>
try at leaſt by gentle means to take
away the Sting from them. The firſt
Foundation to be laid is, that a diſtinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
is to be had of the Popiſh Clergy,
who have ſuch an eternal Intereſt againſt
all accommodation, that it is a hopeleſs thing
to propoſe any thing to them leſs than all;
their Stomachs have been ſet for it ever
ſince the Reformation, they have pinned
themſelves to a Principal that admits no
mean: they believe Proteſtants will be
damn'd, and therefore by an extraordinary
Effect of Chriſtian Charity, they would
deſtroy one half of <hi>England</hi> that the other
might be ſaved; then for this World, they
muſt be in poſſeſſion for God Almighty,
to receive his Rents for him, not to accompt
till the Day of Judgment, which is a good
kind of Tenure, and ye cannot well blame
the good Men, that will ſtir up the Laity
to run any hazard in order to the getting
them reſtor'd. What is it to the Prieſt,
if the deluded Zealot undoes himſelf in the
Attempt? he ſings Maſſes as jollily, and
with as good a Voice at <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>St. Omers</hi>
as ever he did; is a ſingle Man, and can
have no wants but ſuch as may be eaſily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
yet that he may not ſeem altogether
inſenſible, or ungrateful to thoſe that are
his Martyrs, he is ready to aſſure their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52156:88"/>
Executors, and if they pleaſe, will procure
a Grant <hi>ſub Annulo Piſcatoris,</hi> that the
good Man by being changed, has got a
good Bargain, and ſav'd the ſinging of
ſome hundred of years, which he would
elſe have had in Purgatory. There's no
Cure for this Order of Men, no Expedient
to be propos'd, ſo that tho the utmoſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of the Laws againſt them, may
in ſome ſort be mitigated, yet no Treaty
can be made with Men who in this Caſe
have left themſelves no free Will, but are
ſo muffled by Zeal, tyed by Vows, and
kept up by ſuch unchangeable Maxims of
the Prieſthood, that they are to be left as
deſperate Patients, and look'd upon as Men
that will continue in an Eternal State of
Hoſtility, till the Nation is entirely ſubdued
to them. it is then only the Lay Papiſts
that are capable of being treated with, and
we are to examine of what temper they
are, and what Arguments are the moſt
likely to prevail upon them, and how far
'tis adviſeable for the Government to be
Indulgent to them; the Lay Papiſts gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
keep their Religion, rather becauſe
they will not break Company with thoſe of
their Party, than out of any ſettled Zeal that
hath Root in them; moſt of them do by
the Mediation of the Prieſts Marry amongſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52156:88"/>
one another, to keep up an Ignorant Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by hearing only one ſide; others by

there is more Honour in ſupporting an old

tho they had all the Advantage that

yet in a little time they choſe to ſteal over
again, and live here with hazard, rather
than abroad with ſecurity. There is a
Smell in our Native Earth, better than all
the Perfumes in the Eaſt; there is ſomething
in a Mother, tho never ſo Angry, that the
Children will more naturally truſt Her,
than the Studied Civilities of Strangers,
let them be never ſo Hoſpitable; therefore
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52156:89"/>
'tis not adviſeable nor agreeing with the
Rules of Governing Prudence, to provoke
Men by hardſhips to forget that Nature,
which elſe is ſure to be of our ſide.</p>
                     <p>When theſe Men by fair Uſage are put
again into their right Senſes, they will have
quite differing Reflections from thoſe which
Rigour and Perſecution had raiſed in them:
A Lay Papiſt will firſt conſider his Abby-Lands,
which notwithſtanding whatever has
or can be alledged, muſt ſink conſiderably
in the Value, the moment that Popery
prevails; and it being a diſputable Matter,
whether Zeal might not in a little time get
the better of the Law in that caſe; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
Man will admit that as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to perſwade him, to be content with
things as they are, rather than run this
or any other hazard by Change, in which
perhaps he may have no other Advantage,
than that his new humble Confeſſor may
be rais'd to a Biſhoprick, and from thence
look down ſuperciliouſly upon his Patron,
or which is worſe, run to take Poſſeſſion
for God Almighty of his Abby, in ſuch a
manner as the uſurping Landlord (as he will
then be called) ſhall hardly be admitted to
be ſo much as a Tenant to his own Land's,
leſt his Title ſhould prejudge that of the
Church, which will then be the Language;
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52156:89"/>
he will think what diſadvantage 'tis to be
looked upon as a ſeparate Creature, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon a Foreign Intereſt and Authority,
and for that reaſon, expos'd to the Jealouſie
and Suſpicion of his Country-men; he will
reflect what Incumbrance it is to have his
Houſe a Paſture for hungry Prieſts to graze
in, which have ſuch a never-failing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the Fooliſh, which is the
greateſt part of every Man's Family, that
a Man's Dominion, even over his own
Children, is mangled, and divided, if not
totally undermin'd by them; then to be
ſubject to what Arbitrary Taxes the Popiſh
Convocation ſhall impoſe upon them for the
carrying on the Common Intereſt of that
Religion, under Penalty of being mark'd
out for half Hereticks by the reſt of the
Party; to have no ſhare in Buſineſs, no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of ſhewing his own Value to the
World; to live at the beſt an uſeleſs, and
by others to be thought a dangerous Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Nation where he is born, is a
burthen to a generous Mind that cannot be
taken off by all the Pleaſure of a lazy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
life, or by the nauſeous enjoyment
of a dull Plenty, that produceth no good
for the Mind, which will be conſidered in
the firſt place by a Man that has a Soul;
when he ſhall think, that if his Religion,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52156:90"/>
after his wading through a Sea of Blood,
come at laſt to prevail, it would infinitely
leſſen, if not entirely deſtroy the Glory,
Riches, Strength and Liberty of his own
Country. And what a Sacrifice is this
to make to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they are wiſe
enough to wonder there ſhould be ſuch Fools
in the World, as to venture, ſtruggle, and
contend, nay even die Martyrs for that
which, ſhould it ſucceed, would prove a
Judgment inſtead of a Bleſſing to them;
he will conclude that the advantages of
throwing ſome of their Children back again
to God Almighty when they have too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, are not equal to the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
they may either feel or fear, by
continuing their ſeparation from the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>Temporal things will have their weight
in the World, and tho Zeal may prevail
for a time, and get the better in a Skirmiſh,
yet the War ends generally on the ſide of
Fleſh and Blood, and will do ſo till Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
is another thing than it is at preſent:
And therefore a wiſe Papiſt in cold Blood,
conſidering theſe and many other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
which 'twill be worth his pains
to ſee if he can unmuffle himſelf from the
Mask of Infallibility, will think it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſet his Impriſon'd Senſes at Liberty,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52156:90"/>
and that he has a right to ſee with his own
Eyes, hear with his own Ears, and judge by
his own Reaſon; the conſequence of which
might probably be, that weighing things
in a right Scale, and ſeeing them in their
true Colours, he would diſtinguiſh between
the merit of ſuffering for a good Cauſe,
and the fooliſh oſtentation of drawing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
upon himſelf; and therefore
will not be unwilling to be convinc'd that
our Proteſtant Creed may make him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
this. A few of ſuch wiſe Proſelytes would
by their Example draw ſo many after
them, that the Party would inſenſibly melt
away, and in a little time, without any
angry word, we ſhould come to an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that all Good Men would have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to rejoyce at; but we are not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
upon theſe Converſions, without
preparing Men for them by kind and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
Arguments; nothing is ſo againſt
our Nature, as to believe thoſe can be in
the right who are too hard upon us; there
is a deformity in every thing that doth
us hurt, it will look ſcurvily in our Eye
while the ſmart continues, and a Man
muſt have an extraordinary Meaſure of
Grace, to think well of a Religion that
reduces him and his Family to Miſery;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52156:91"/>
in this reſpect our <hi>Trimmer</hi> would conſent
to the mitigation of ſuch Laws as were
made, (as it's ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. got
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) in a heat againſt <hi>Rome:</hi>
It may be ſaid that even States as well as
private Men are ſubject to Paſſion; a juſt
indignation of a villainous Attempt produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at the ſame time ſuch Remedies, as
perhaps are not without ſome mixture of
Revenge, and therefore tho time cannot
Repeal a Law, it may by a Natural Effect
ſoften the Execution of it; there is leſs
danger to Rouſe a Lyon when at Reſt,
than to awake Laws that were intended to
have their time of Sleeping, nay more than
that, in ſome Caſes their Natural periods
of Life, dying of themſelves without the
Solemnity of being revok'd, any otherwiſe
than by the common conſent of Mankind,
who do ceaſe to Execute, when the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in great Meaſure fail that firſt Created
and Juſtify'd the Rigour of ſuch unuſual Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is not eager to pick out
ſome places in Hiſtory againſt this or any
other Party; quite contrary, is very ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
to find out any thing that may be
healing, and tend to an Agreement; but
to preſcribe the means of this Gentleneſs
ſo as to make it effectual, muſt come from
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52156:91"/>
the only place that can furniſh Remedies
for this Cure, <hi>viz.</hi> a Parliament; in the
mean time, it is to be wiſhed there may
be ſuch a mutual calmneſs of Mind, as that
the Proteſtants might not be ſo jealous, as
ſtill to ſmell the Match that was to blow
up the King and both Houſes in the Gun-powder
Treaſon, or to ſtart at every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Popery, as if it were juſt taking
Poſſeſſion. On the other ſide, let not the
Papiſts ſuffer themſelves to be led by any
hopes, tho never ſo flattering, to a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or Oſtentation which muſt provoke
Men to be leſs kind to them; let them
uſe Modeſty on their ſides, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
Indulgence on theirs; and by this
means there will be an overlooking of all
Venial Faults, a tacit connivence at all things
that do not carry Scandal with them, and
would amount to a kind of Natural Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
with the ſevere Laws, ſince there
would be no more Accuſers to be found,
when the occaſions of Anger and Animoſity
are once remov'd; let the Papiſts in the
mean time remember, that there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
due from all leſſer numbers to greater,
a deference to be paid by an Opinion that
is Exploded, to one that is Eſtabliſhed;
ſuch a Thought well digeſted will have an
influence upon their Behaviour, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52156:92"/>
ſuch a Temper as muſt win the moſt

                     <p>THE World is ſo compos'd, that it is
hard, if not impoſſible, for a Nation
not to be a great deal involv'd in the fate
of their Neighbours, and tho by the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Situation, we are more Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
than any other People, yet we have
in all Ages been concern'd for our own ſakes
in the Revolutions abroad. There was a
time when <hi>England</hi> was the over-balancing
Power of Chriſtendom, and that either by
Inheritance or Conqueſt, the better part
of <hi>France</hi> receiv'd Laws from us; after
that we being reduc'd into our own Limits,
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> became the Rivals for
the Univerſal Monarchy, and our third
Power, tho in it ſelf leſs than either of the
other, hapned to be Superiour to any of
them, by that choice we had of throwing
the Scales on that ſide to which we gave
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52156:92"/>
our Friendſhip. I do not know whether
this Figure did not make us as great as our
former Conqueſt, to be a perpetual Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of two great contending Powers, who
gave us all their Courtſhip, and offer'd all
their Incenſe at our Altar, whilſt the Fate
of either Prince ſeemed to depend upon
the Oracles we delivered; for the King of
<hi>England</hi> to ſit on his Throne, as in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Court of Juſtice, to which the two
great Monarchs appeal, pleading their Cauſe,
and expecting their Sentence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> declaring
which ſide was in the right, or at leaſt if
we pleas'd which ſide ſhould have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it, was a piece of Greatneſs which
was peculiar to us, and no wonder if we
endeavour to preſerve it, as we did for a
conſiderable time, it being our Safety, as
well as Glory, to maintain it; but by a
Fatality upon our Councils, or by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
Policy of this latter Age, we have
thought fit to uſe induſtry to deſtroy this
mighty Power, which we have ſo long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed;
and that equality between the Two
Monarchs, which we might for ever have
preſerved, has been chiefly broken by us,
whoſe Intereſt it was above all others to
maintain it; when one of them, like the
overflowing of the Sea, had gained more
upon the other than our convenience, or
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52156:93"/>
indeed our ſafety, would allow; inſtead of
mending the Banks, or making new ones,
we our ſelves with our own hands helpt to
cut them, to invite and make way for a
farther Inundation. <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> have
had their ſeveral turns in making uſe of our
Miſtakes, and we have been formerly as
deaf to the Inſtances of the then weaker part
of the World to help them againſt the Houſe
of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> as we can now be to the Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Spain,</hi> that we would aſſiſt them againſt
the Power of <hi>France. Gondamar</hi> was as ſawey,
and as powerful too in King <hi>James</hi> his Court,
as any French Ambaſſadour can have been at
any time ſince, when Men talk as wrong
then on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſide, and made their
Court by it, as well as any can have done
ſince by talking as much for the <hi>French;</hi> ſo
that from that time, inſtead of weighing in
a wiſe Balance the power of either Crown,
it looks as if we had learnt only to weigh
the Penſions, and take the heavieſt.</p>
                     <p>It would be tedious, as well as unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
to recapitulate all our wrong ſteps,
ſo that I will go no farther than the King's
Reſtauration, at which time the Balance
was on the ſide of <hi>France,</hi> and that by
the means of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> who for a ſeparate
Intereſt of his own had ſacrificed that of
the Nation, by joining with the ſtronger
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52156:93"/>
ſide, to ſuppreſs the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> which
he ought to have ſupported. Such a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
was natural enough to an Uſurper,
and ſhew'd he was not the Lawful Father
of the People, by his having ſo little care
of them; and the Example coming from
that hand, one would think ſhould, for
that Reaſon, be leſs likely to be follow'd.
But to go on, home comes the King, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with Courtſhips from all Nations
abroad, of which ſome did it not only to
make them forget how familiarly they had
us'd him when he was in other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
but to beſpeak the Friendſhip of
a Prince, who beſides his other Greatneſs,
was yet more conſiderable by being re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by the love of his people. <hi>France</hi>
had an Intereſt either to diſpoſe us to ſo
much good will, or at leaſt to put us into
ſuch a Condition, that we might give no
Oppoſition to their Deſigns; and <hi>Flanders</hi>
being a perpetual Object in their Eye, a

commit a Rape upon her, which they

her, when-ever they ſhould hear her cry
out for help to them; to this end they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52156:94"/>
put in practice Seaſonable and Artificial
Whiſpers, to widen things between us,
and the States. <hi>Amboyna</hi> and the Fiſhery

                     <p>This had ſo good an effect, that <hi>France</hi>
was ſtopt in its Career, and the Peace of

'Twas a forc'd put; and tho <hi>France</hi> wiſely
diſſembled their inward diſſatisfaction, yet
from the very moment they reſolv'd to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the Triple knot, whatever it coſt them;
for his Chriſtian Majeſty, after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering
Meals, ever riſes with a ſtomach,
and he lik'd the Pattern ſo well, that it
gave him a longing deſire to have the whole
Piece. Amongſt the other means uſed for
the attaining this end, the ſending over the
Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans,</hi> was not the leaſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful;
ſhe was a very welcome Gueſt here,
and her own Charms and Dexterity joined
with other Advantages, that might help
her perſwaſions, gave her ſuch an Aſcendant,
that ſhe ſhould hardly fail of ſucceſs. One
of the Preliminaries of her Treaty, tho a
trivial thing in it ſelf, yet was conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Conſequence, as very ſmall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52156:95"/>
often are in relation to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the World. About this time
a general Humour, in oppoſition to <hi>France,</hi>
had made us throw off their Faſhion, and
put on Veſts, that we might look more
like a diſtinct People, and not be under the
ſervility of imitation, which ever pays a
greater deference to the Original; than is
conſiſtent with the Equality all Independent
Nations ſhould pretend to; <hi>France</hi> did not
like this ſmall beginning of ill Humours, at
leaſt of Emulation, and wiſely conſidering
that it is a natural Introduction firſt to make
the World their Apes, that they may be
afterwards their Slaves. It was thought
that one of the Inſtructions Madam brought
along with her, was to laugh us out of theſe
Veſts, which ſhe performed ſo effectually,
that in a moment, like ſo many Footmen
who had quitted their Maſters Livery, we
all took it again, and returned to our old
Service; ſo that the very time of doing it
gave a very critical Advantage to <hi>France;</hi> ſince
it lookt like an Evidence of our returning
to their Intereſt, as well as to their Faſhion,
and would give ſuch a diſtruſt of us to our
new Allies, that it might facilitate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of the knot, which tied them ſo
within their bounds, that they were very
impatient till they were freed from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

But the Lady had a more extended Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
than this and without doubt we
double-laid the Foundation of a new ſtrict
Alliance, quite contrary to the other, in
which we had been ſo lately engag'd. And
of this there were ſuch early appearances,
that the World began to look upon us as fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into Apoſtacy from the common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.
Notwithſtanding all this, <hi>France</hi> did
not neglect at the ſame time to give good
words to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and even to feed them
with hopes of ſupporting them againſt us,
when on a ſudden, that never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Declaration of War againſt them
comes out, only to vindicate his own Glory,
and to revenge the Injuries done to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>England,</hi> by which he became our
Second in this Duel; ſo humble can this
Prince be, when at the ſame time he does
more Honour than we deſerve, he lays a
greater ſhare of the blame upon our Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
than did naturally belong to us; the
particulars of that War, our part in it while
we ſtaid in it, and when we were out of
breath, our leaving the <hi>French</hi> to make an
end of it, are things too well known to
make it neceſſary, and too unwelcome in
themſelves to incite me to repeat them;
only the wiſdom of <hi>France</hi> is in this to be
obſerv'd, That when we had made a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52156:96"/>
Peace, which left them ſingle to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the united Force of the Confederates,
they were ſo far from being angry, that
they would not ſhew ſo much as the leaſt
coldneſs, hoping to get as much by our
Mediation for a Peace, as they would have
expected from our Aſſiſtance in the War, our
Circumſtances at that time conſidered; This
ſeaſonable piece of Indulgence in not reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us, but rather allowing thoſe Neceſſities
of State which we gave for our Excuſe, was
ſuch an engaging Method, that it went a
great way to keep us ſtill in their Chains,
when, to the Eye of the World, we had abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
broke looſe from them: And what paſs'd
afterwards at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> tho the King's Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality
gave him the outward Figure of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
it appear'd that his Interpoſition was
extremely ſuſpected of Partiality by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
who upon that Ground did both at
and before the Concluſion of that Treaty,
treat his Miniſters there with a great deal of
neglect in his Peace as well as that in the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renean</hi>
and <hi>Aix le Chapelle,</hi> the King of
<hi>France,</hi> at the Moment of making it, had
the thought of breaking it; for a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time after he broach'd his Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon <hi>Aloſt,</hi> which were things that if
they had been offer'd by a leſs formidable
hand, would have been ſmiled at; but ill
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52156:96"/>
Arguments being ſeconded by good Armies,
carry ſuch a power with them, that naked
ſenſe is a very unequal Adverſary. It was
thought that theſe aiery Claims were chiefly
rais'd with the proſpect of getting <hi>Luxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
for the Equivalent; and this Opinion
was confirm'd by the blocking it up after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
pretending to the Country of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may,</hi>
that it might be entirely ſurrounded
by the French Dominions, and it was ſo
preſſed that it might have fallen in a little
time, if the King of <hi>France</hi> had not ſent
Orders to his Troops to retire, and his
Chriſtian Generoſity which was aſſign'd
for the reaſon of it, made the World ſmile,
ſince it is ſeen how differently his devout
Zeal works in <hi>Hungary:</hi> that ſpecious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was in many reſpects ill-tim'd, and
<hi>France</hi> it ſelf gave it ſo faintly, that at the
very time it look'd out of Countenance;
the true ground of his Retiring is worth
our obſervation; for at the inſtance of the
Confederates, Offices were done, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials
given, but all ineffectual till the
word <hi>Parliament</hi> was put into them; that
powerful word had ſuch an effect, that even
at that diſtance it rais'd the Seige, which
may convince us of what efficacy the King
of <hi>England</hi>'s words are, when he will give
them their full weight, and threaten with his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52156:97"/>
                        <hi>Parliament;</hi> it is then that he appears that
great Figure we ought to repreſent him in
our Minds, the Nation his Body, he the
Head, and joined with that Harmony, that
every word he pronounces is the Word
of a Kingdom: Such words, as appears
by this Example, are as effectual as
Fleets and Armies, becauſe they can create
them, and without this his word ſounds
abroad like a faint Whiſper, that is either
not heard, or (which is worſe) not minded.
But tho <hi>France</hi> had made this ſtep of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Compliance, it did not mean to leave
off the purſuit of their pretenſions; and
therefore immediately propoſed the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
to the King; but it appear'd, that
notwithſtanding his <hi>Merit</hi> towards the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
in ſaving <hi>Luxenburg,</hi> the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
of what had paſſed before, had left
ſuch an ill taſte in their <hi>Mouths,</hi> that they
could not Reliſh our being put into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to diſpoſe of their Intereſts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
declin'd it by inſiſting upon a general
Treaty, to which <hi>France</hi> has ever ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to be averſe; our great earneſtneſs
alſo to perſwade the Confederates to conſent
to it, was ſo unuſual, and ſo ſuſpicious a
method, that it might naturally make them
believe, that <hi>France</hi> ſpake to them by our
<hi>Mouth,</hi> and for that Reaſon, if there has
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52156:97"/>
been no other, might hinder the accepting
it; and ſo little care hath been taken to
cure this, or other Jealouſies the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
may have entertain'd, that quite
contrary, their <hi>Miniſters</hi> here every day
take freſh Alarms, from what they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in ſmall, as well as in greater Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
and they being apt both to take
and improve apprehenſions of this kind,
draw ſuch Inferences from them, as make
them entirely deſpair of us.</p>
                     <p>Thus we now ſtand, far from being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Spectators of our Neighbours Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
and by a fatal miſtake forgetting what
a Certain Fore-runner it is to our own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and now it's time our <hi>Trimmer</hi> ſhould tell
ſomething of his Opinion, upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
State of things abroad, he firſt profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to have no Biaſs, either for or againſt
<hi>France,</hi> and that his thoughts are wholly
directed by the Intereſt of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
he allows, and has read that <hi>Spain</hi>
uſed the ſame Methods, when it was in its
heighth, as <hi>France</hi> doth now, and therefore
it is not Partiality that moves him; but
the juſt fear which all reaſonable Men muſt
be poſſeſs'd with, of an over-growing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
<hi>Ambition</hi> is a devouring Beaſt, when
it hath ſwallow'd one Province, inſtead of
being cloyed, it has ſo much the greater
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52156:98"/>
                        <hi>Stomach</hi> to another, and being fed, becomes
ſtill the more hungry; ſo that for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates
to expect a ſecurity from any
thing but their own united ſtrength, is a
moſt miſerable fallacy; and if they cannot
reſiſt the <hi>Incroachments</hi> of <hi>France</hi> by their
Arms, it is in vain for them to dream of
any other means of preſervation; it would
have the better grace, beſides the ſaving ſo
much Blood and Ruin, to give up all at
once; make a Preſent of themſelves, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
this haughty Monarch, rather than
be whiſper'd, flatter'd, or cozened out of
their liberty. Nothing is ſo ſoft as the firſt
applications of a greater Prince, to engage
a weaker, but that ſmiling Countenance
is but a Vizard, it is not the true Face;
for as ſoon as their turn is ſerv'd, the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
flies to ſome other Prince or State,
where the ſame part is to be acted over
again, leaves the old miſtaken Friend, to
Neglect and Contempt, and like an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Lover to Caſt off Miſtreſs, Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
her with that Infamy, of which he
himſelf was the Author, <hi>Sweden, Bavaria,
Palatine, &amp;c.</hi> may by their Freſh Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
teach other Princes what they are
reaſonably to expect, and what Snakes are
hid under the Flowers the Court of <hi>France</hi>
ſo liberally throws upon them, whilſt they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52156:98"/>
can be uſeful. The various Methods and
deep Intrigues, with the differing Notes in
ſeveral Countries, do not only give ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
but aſſurance that every thing is put
in Practice, by which univerſal Monarchy
may be obtain'd. Who can reconcile the
withdrawing of his Troops from <hi>Luxenburg,</hi>
in conſideration of the War in <hi>Hungary,</hi>
which was not then declared, and preſently
after encouraging the <hi>Turk</hi> to take <hi>Vienna,</hi>
and conſequently to deſtroy the Empire?
Or who can think that the Perſecution of
the Poor Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of God, as an Atonement for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
the loſs of the whole Chriſtian
Faith? Can he be thought in earneſt, when
he ſeem'd to be afraid of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and
for that reaſon muſt have <hi>Luxenburg,</hi> and
that he cannot be ſafe from <hi>Germany,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he is in poſſeſſion of <hi>Strasburg?</hi> All In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
and Violence muſt in it ſelf be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
but the aggravations of ſupporting
'em by falſe Arguments, and inſulting Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
has ſomething in it yet more provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
than the Injuries themſelves; and the
World has ground enough to apprehend,
from ſuch a Method of arguing, that even
their Senſes are to be ſubdu'd as well as
their Liberties. Then the variety of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
uſed by <hi>France</hi> in ſeveral Countries
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52156:99"/>
is very obſervable: In <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi>
nothing inſiſted on but the Greatneſs and
Authority of the Crown; on the other
ſide, the Great Men in <hi>Poland</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
who differ in Opinion with the
King, and they argue like Friends to the
Privilege of Dyet, againſt the ſeparate
Power of the Crown: In <hi>Sweden</hi> they are
troubled that the King ſhould have chang'd
ſomething there of late, by his ſingle Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
from the antient and ſettled Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Conſtitutions: At <hi>Ratis bone,</hi>
the moſt Chriſtian Majeſty taketh the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of all the Electors, and free States,
into his Protection, and tells them the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
is a dangerous Man, an aſpiring He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,
that would infallibly devour them, if
he was not at hand to reſiſt him on their
behalf; but above all in <hi>Holland,</hi> he has
the moſt obliging tenderneſs for the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,</hi>
and is in ſuch diſquiets, leſt it
ſhould be invaded by the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
that they can do no leſs in gratitude, than
undo themſelves when he bids them, to
ſhow how ſenſible they are of his exceſſive
good Nature; yet in ſpight of all theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions,
there are in the World ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
<hi>States-men,</hi> as will upon their Credit
affirm the following Paradoxes to he real
truth; firſt that <hi>France</hi> alone is ſincere and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:52156:99"/>
keeps its Faith, and conſequently that it is
the only Friend we can rely upon; that
the King of <hi>France,</hi> of all Men living,
has the leaſt mind to be a Conqueror; that
he is a ſleepy, tame Creature, void of all
Ambition, a poor kind of a Man, that has
no farther thoughts than to be quiet; that
he is charm'd by his Friendſhip to us, that
it is impoſſible he ſhould ever do us hurt,
and therefore tho <hi>Flanders</hi> was loſt, it
would not in the leaſt concern us; that he
would fain help the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to
be abſolute, which would be to take pains
to put it into a condition to oppoſe him,
as it is, and muſt be our Intereſt, as long
as he continues in ſuch an overballancing
Power and Greatneſs.</p>
                     <p>Such a Creed as this, if once receiv'd,
might prepare our belief for greater things,
and as he that taught Men to eat a Dagger,
began firſt with a Pen knife; ſo if we can be
prevail'd with to digeſt the ſmaller Miſtakes,
we may at laſt make our ſtomachs ſtrong
enough for that of Tranſubſtantiation.
Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> cannot eaſily be converted
out of his ſenſes by theſe State Sophiſters,
and yet he has no ſuch peeviſh Obſtinacy
as to reject all Correſpondence with <hi>France,</hi>
becauſe we ought to be apprehenſive of
the too great power of it; he would not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52156:100"/>
have the kings Friendſhip to the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
extended to the involving him in any
unreaſonable or dangerous Engagements,
neither would he have him lay aſide the
conſideration of his better eſtabliſhment at
home, out of his exceſſive Zeal to ſecure
his Allies abroad; but ſure there might be
a Mean between theſe two oppoſite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,
and it may be wiſh'd that our
Friendſhip with <hi>France</hi> ſhould at leaſt be
ſo bounded, that it may conſiſt with the
humour as well as the Intereſt of <hi>England.</hi>
There is no Woman but has the fears of
contraictng too near an intimacy with a
much greater Beauty, becauſe it expoſes
her too often to a Compariſon that is not
advantageous to her; and ſure it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Prince to be as jealous of his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as a Lady can be of her good looks,
and to be as much out of Countenance,
to be thought an humble Companion to
ſo much a greater Power; to be always
ſeen in an ill Light, to be ſo darkned by
the brightneſs of a greater Star, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
mortifying; and when <hi>England</hi> might
ride Admiral at the head of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
to look like the Kitching-Yatch to
the Grand <hi>Louis,</hi> is but a ſcurvy Figure for
us to make in the Map of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> it
would riſe up in our <hi>Trimmer</hi>'s ſtomach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52156:100"/>
if ever (which God forbid) the power of
calling and intermitting Parliaments here,
ſhould be transferred to the Crown of
<hi>France,</hi> and that all the opportunities of
our own ſettlements at home ſhould give
way to their Projects abroad; and that our
Intereſts ſhould be ſo far ſacrific'd to our
Compliance, that all the Omnipotence of
<hi>France</hi> can never make us full amends for it
In the mean time, he ſhrinks at the diſmal
proſpect he can by no means drive away
from his thoughts, that when <hi>France</hi> has
gather'd all the fruit ariſing from our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes,
and that we can bear no more with
them, they will cut down the Tree
and throw it into the fire; for all this while,
ſome Superfine States-Men, to comfort us,
would ſain perſwade the World that this
or that accident may ſave us, and for all
that is or ought to be dear to us, would
have us to rely wholly upon Chance, not
conſidering that Fortune is Wiſdoms Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that God Almighty loves to be
on the Wiſeſt as well as the Strongeſt ſide;
therefore this is ſuch a miſerable ſhift, ſuch
a ſhameful Evaſion, that they would be
laught to death for it, if the ruining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this Miſtake did not more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Men to rage, and a deteſtation of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:52156:101"/>
Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is far from Idolatry in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, in one thing only he comes
near it, his Country is in ſome degree his
Idol; he does not Worſhip the Sun, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis not peculiar to us, it rambles about
the World, and is leſs kind to us than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
but for the Earth of <hi>England,</hi> tho
perhaps inferior to that of many places
abroad, to him there is Divinity in it, and
he would rather dye, than ſee a piece of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Glaſs trampled down by a Foreign
Treſpaſſer: He thinks there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his mind, for all plants are apt to
taſte of the Soyl in which they grow, and
we that grow here, have a Root that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
in us a Stalk of Engliſh Juice, which
is not to be changed by grafting or foreign
infuſion and I do not know whether any
thing leſs will prevail, than the Modern
Experiment, by which the Blood of one
Creature is tranſmitted into another; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which, before the <hi>French</hi> can be
let into our Bodies, every drop of our own
muſt be drawn out of them.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> cannot but lament, that
by a Sacrifice too great for one Nation to
another, we ſhould be like a rich Mine,
made uſeleſs only for want of being wrought,
and that the Life and Vigour which ſhould
move us againſt our Enemies is miſerably
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52156:101"/>
apply'd to tear our own Bowels; that being
made by our happy ſituation, not only
ſafer, but if we pleaſe greater too, than
other Countries which far exceed us in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
that having Courage by Nature,
Learning by Induſtry, and Riches by Trade,
we ſhould corrupt all theſe Advantages,
ſo as to make them inſignificant, and by a
fatality which ſeems peculiar to us, miſplace
our active rage one againſt another, whilſt
we are turn'd into Statues on that ſide
where lies our greateſt danger; to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd
not only at our Neighbours ruine
but our own, and let our Iſland lie like a
great Hulk in the Sea, without Rudder or
Sail, all the Men caſt away in her, or as
if we were all Children in a great Cradle,
and rockt aſleep to a foreign Tune.</p>
                     <p>I ſay when our <hi>Trimmer</hi> repreſenteth
to his Mind, our Roſes blaſted and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd,
whilſt the Lilies Triumph and grow
Inſolent, upon the Compariſon; when he
conſiders our own once flouriſhing Lawrel,
now withered and dying, and nothing left
us but a remembrance of a better part in
Hiſtory, than we ſhall make in the next
Age: which will be no more to us than
an Eſcutcheon hung upon our Door when
we are dead; when he foreſees from hence,
growing Infamy from abroad, confuſion
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52156:102"/>
at home, and all this without the poſſibility
of a Cure, in reſpect of the voluntary fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
good Men put upon themſelves by
their Allegiance without a good meaſure
of preventing Grace, he would be tempted
to go out of the World like a <hi>Roman</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,
rather than endure the burthen of
Life under ſuch a diſcouraging Proſpect.
But Miſtakes, as all other things, have
their Periods, and many times the neareſt
way to Cure, is not to oppoſe them, but
ſtay till they are cruſht with their own
weight: for Nature will not allow any
thing to continue long that is violent;
violence is a wound, and as a wound, muſt
be curable in a little time, or elſe 'tis Mortal;
but a Nation, comes near to be Immortal,
therefore the wound will one time or another
be cured, tho perhaps by ſuch rough Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
if too long forborn, as may even
make the beſt Remedies we can prepare,
to be at the ſame time a Melancholy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
to us; there is but one thing
(God Almighties Providence excepted) to
ſupport a Man from ſinking under theſe
afflicting thoughts, and that is the hopes
we draw ſingly from the King himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

an engaging Look, that diſarms
Men of their ill Humors, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments;
ſomething in him that wanteth
a Name, and can be no more defined than
it can be reſiſted; a Gift of Heaven, of its
laſt finiſhing, where it will be peculiarly
kind; the only Prince in the World that
dares be familiar, or that has right to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over thoſe forms which were firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
to give awe to thoſe who could not
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52156:103"/>
judge, and to hide Defects from thoſe that
could; a Prince that has exhauſted himſelf
by his Liberality, and endanger'd himſelf
by his Mercy; who out-ſhines by his own
Light and natural Virtues all the varniſh
of ſtudied Acquiſitions; his Faults are like
Shades to a good Picture, or like Allay to
Gold, to make it the more uſeful, he may
have ſome, but for any Man to ſee them
through ſo many reconciling Virtues, is a
Sacrilegious piece of ill nature, of which
no generous Mind can be guilty; a Prince
that deſerves to be lov'd for his own ſake,
even without the help of a Compariſon;
our Love, our Duty, and our Danger, all
join to cement our Obedience to him; in
ſhort whatever, he can do, it is no more
poſſible for us to be angry with him, than
with a Bank that ſecures us from the raging
Sea, the kind Shade that hides us from the
ſcorching Sun, the welcome Hand that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
us a Reprieve, or with the Guardian
Angel, that reſcues our Souls from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
Jaws of wretched Eternity.</p>

                     <head>CONCLUSION</head>
                     <p>TO Conclude, our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is ſo fully
ſatisfy'd of the Truth of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
by which he is directed, in reference
to the Publick, that he will neither be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctored
and Threatned, Laught, nor Drunk
out of them; and inſtead of being conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Arguments of his Adverſaries to
their Opinions, he is very much confirmed
in his own by them; he profeſſes ſolemnly
that were it in his Power to chuſe, he would
rather have his Ambition bounded by the
Commands of a Great and Wiſe Maſter,
than let it range with a Popular Licence,
tho' crown'd with ſucceſs; yet he cannot
commit ſuch a Sin againſt the glorious thing
call'd Liberty, nor let his Soul ſtoop ſo
much below it ſelf, as to be content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repining to have his Reaſon wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd,
or the Privilege of Acting like a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Creature, torn from him by the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Dictates of unlimited Authority, in
what hand ſoever it happens to be plac'd.
What is there in this that is ſo Criminal, as
to deſerve the Penalty of that moſt ſingular
Apophthegm, <hi>A</hi> Trimmer <hi>is worſe than a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel?</hi>
What do angry men ail to rail ſo againſt
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52156:104"/>
Moderation, do's it not look as if they were
going to ſome very ſcurvy Extreme, that is
too ſtrong to be digeſted by the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
part of Mankind? Theſe Arbitrary
Methods, beſides the injuſtice of them, are
(God be thanked) very unskillful too, for
they fright the Birds, by talking ſo loud,
from coming into the Nets that are laid
for them; and when Men agree to rifle a
Houſe, they ſeldom give warning, or blow
a Trumpet; but there are ſome ſmall States-Men,
who are ſo full charg'd with their
own Expectations, that they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                     <p>And kind Heaven by ſending ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
Curſe upon their undertakings, has
made their ignorance an Antidote againſt
their Malice; ſome of theſe cannot treat
peaceably, yielding will not ſatiſfy them,
they will have men by ſtorm; there are
others, that muſt have Plots, to make their
Service more neceſſary, and have an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
to keep them alive, ſince they are to
live upon them; and perſwade the King to
retrench his own Greatneſs, ſo as to ſhrink
into the head of a Party, which is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
him into ſuch a Unprincely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
and to ſuch a wilful diminution of
himſelf, that they are the laſt Enemies he
ought to allow himſelf to forgive; ſuch
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52156:104"/>
Men, if they could, would prevail with
the Sun to ſhine only upon them and their
Friends, and to leave all the reſt of the
World in the dark; this is a very unuſual
Monopoly, and may come within the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Law, which makes it Treaſon to
Impriſon the King, when ſuch unfitting
bounds are put to his Favour, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to the narrow limits of a particular
ſet of Men, that would incloſe him; theſe
Honeſt and only Loyal Gentlemen, if they
may be allow'd to bear Witneſs for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
make a King their Engine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade
him into a property at the very time
that their Flattery would make him believe
they paid Divine Worſhip to him; beſides
theſe there is a flying Squadron on both
ſides, that are afraid the World ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
ſmall dabblers in Conjuring, that raiſe
angry Apparitions to keep Men from being
reconcil'd, like Waſps that fly up and down,
buz and ſting to keep Men unquiet; but
theſe Infects are commonly ſhort-liv'd Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and no doubt in a little time Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
will be rid of them; they were Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
at leaſt who fought once againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
but for ſuch Pigmies as theſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
againſt it, is ſuch a provoking Folly,
that the inſolent Bunglers ought to be laught
and hiſt our of the World for it; they
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52156:105"/>
ſhould conſder there is a Soul in that great
body of the People, which may for a time
be drowzy and unactive, but when the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan
is rouz'd, it moves like an angry
Creature, and will neither be convinc'd nor
reſiſted: the People can never agree to ſhew
their united Powers, till they are extremely
tempted and provoked to it, ſo that to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
Cupping-Glaſſes to a great Beaſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
diſpos'd to ſleep, and to force the
Tame thing whether it will or no to be Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
muſt be learnt out of ſome other
Book than <hi>Machiavil,</hi> who would never
have preſcrib'd ſuch a prepoſterous Method.
It is to be remembred, that if Princes have
Law and Authority on their ſides, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
on theirs may have Nature, which is a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ormidable Adverſary; Duty, Juſtice, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
nay, even Humane Prudence too,
bids the People ſuffer any thing rather than
reſiſt; but uncorrected Nature, where e're
it feels the ſmart will run to the neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
Mens Paſſions in this Caſe are to be
conſider'd as well as their Duty, let it be
never ſo ſtrongly enforc'd, for if their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are provok'd, they being as much a
part of us as our Limbs, they lead Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a ſhort way of Arguing, that admits no
diſtinction, and from the foundation of Self-Defence,
they will draw Inferences, that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52156:105"/>
will have miſerable effects upon the quiet of
a Government.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> therefore dreads a general
diſcontent, becauſe he thinks it differs, from
a Rebellion, only as a Spotted Fever does
from the Plague, the ſame Species under
a lower degree of Malignity; it works ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ways; ſometimes like a ſlow Poyſon
that has its Effects at a great diſtance from
the time it was given, ſometimes like dry
Flax prepared to catch at the firſt Fire, or
like Seed in the ground ready to ſprout up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt Shower; in every ſhape 'tis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and our <hi>Trimmer</hi> thinks no pains or
precaution can be ſo great as to prevent it.</p>
                     <p>In ſhort he thinks himſelf in the right,
grounding his Opinion upon that Truth,
which equally hates to be under the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
of wrangling Sophiſtry of the one
hand, or the ſhort dictates of miſtaken Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
on the other.</p>
                     <p>Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> adores the Goddeſs Truth,
tho' in all Ages ſhe has been ſcurvily uſed,
as well as thoſe that Worſhipped her; 'tis
of late become ſuch a ruining Virtue, that
Mankind ſeems to be agreed to command
and avoid it; yet the want of Practice
which Repeals the other Laws, has no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
upon the Law of Truth, becauſe it
has root in Heaven, and an Intrinſick value
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52156:106"/>
in it ſelf, that can never be impaired; ſhe
ſhews her Greatneſs in this, that her Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
even when they are ſucceſsful are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd
to own it; nothing but Power full
of Truth has the prerogative of Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing,
not only after Victories, but in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpite
of them, and to put Conqueſt her ſelf
out of Countenance; ſhe may be kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and ſuppreſt, but her Dignity ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
with her, even when ſhe is in Chains;
Falſhood with all her Impudence, has not
enough to ſpeak ill of her before her Face,
ſuch Majeſty ſhe carries about her, that her
moſt proſperous Enemies are fain to whiſper
their Treaſon; all the Power upon Earth
can never extinguiſh her; ſhe has liv'd in all
Ages; and let the Miſtaken Zeal of prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Authority, Chriſten any oppoſition to
it, with what Name they pleaſe, ſhe makes
it not only an ugly and unmannerly, but a
dangerous thing to perſiſt; ſhe has lived ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
retired indeed, nay ſometime ſo buried,
that only ſome few of the diſcerning part of
Mankind could have a Glimpſe of her; with
all that ſhe has Eternity in her, ſhe knows
not how to die, and from the darkeſt
Clouds that ſhade and cover her, ſhe breaks
from time to time with Triumph for her
Friends, and Terrour to her Enemies.</p>

                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:52156:106"/>
Our <hi>Trimmer</hi> therefore inſpired by this
Divine Virtue, thinks fit to conclude with
theſe Aſſertions, That our Climate is a <hi>Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi>
between that part of the World where
men are Roaſted, and the other where they
are Frozen; That our Church is a <hi>Trimmer</hi>
between the Phrenzy of Platonick Viſions,
and the Lethargick Ignorance of Popiſh
Dreams; That our Laws are <hi>Trimmers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Exceſs of unbounded Power, and
the Extravagance of Liberty not enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained;
That true Virtue has ever been
thought a <hi>Trimmer,</hi> and to have its dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the middle between the two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams;
That even God Almighty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is divided between his two great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
his Mercy and his Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>In ſuch Company, our <hi>Trimmer</hi> is not
aſham'd of his Name, and willingly leaves
to the bold Champions of either Extream,
the Honour of contending with no leſs Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
than Nature, Religion, Liberty,
Prudence, Humanity and Common Senſe.</p>

                  <head>THE
ANATOMY
OF AN
EQUIVALENT.</head>
                  <p>I. THE World hath of late years ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been without ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Word</hi> to furniſh the Coffee-Houſes
and fill the Pamphlets. Sometimes
it is a <hi>new</hi> one invented, and ſometimes
an <hi>old</hi> one revived. They are uſually
fitted to ſome preſent purpoſe, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
as differing as the various deſigns
ſeveral parties may have, either to delude
the People, or to expoſe their Adverſaries:
They are not of long continuance, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they have paſſed a little while, and that
they are grown nauſeous by being ſo often
repeated, they give place to ſomething
that is newer. Thus after <hi>Whig, Tory,</hi>
and <hi>Trimmer</hi> have had their time, now
they are dead and forgotten, being ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the word <hi>Equivalent,</hi> which reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in their ſtead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52156:108"/>
The Birth of it is in ſhort this: After
many repeated Eſſayes to diſpoſe Men to
the Repeal of Oaths and Teſts, made for
the ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion,
the general averſion to comply in it was
found to be ſo great, that it was thought
adviſeable to try another manner of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
it, and to ſee whether by putting
the <hi>ſame thing</hi> into <hi>another Mould,</hi> and
ſoftning an <hi>harſh Propoſition</hi> by a <hi>plauſible
Term,</hi> they might not have better ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>To this end, inſtead of an <hi>abſolute quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
of theſe Laws, without any Condition;
which was the <hi>firſt</hi> Propoſal; now it is
put into gentler Language, and runneth
thus; <hi>If you will take away the</hi> Oaths <hi>and</hi>
Teſts, <hi>you ſhall have as good a thing for
them.</hi> This put into the faſhionable Word,
is now called an <hi>Equivalent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>II. So much to the Word it ſelf. I will
now endeavour in ſhort to examine and
explain, in order to the having it fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
Firſt, What <hi>is</hi> the nature of a true <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent;</hi>
and
In the next place, What things <hi>are not</hi> to
be admitted under that denomination.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall treat theſe as general Propoſitions,
and though I cannot undertake how far
they may be <hi>convincing,</hi> I may ſafely do it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52156:108"/>
that they are <hi>impartial;</hi> of which there can
be no greater evidence than that I make nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Inference nor Application, but leave
that part entirely to the Reader, according
as his own Thoughts ſhall direct and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him.</p>
                  <p>III. I will firſt take notice, that this
Word, by the application which hath been
made of it in ſome modern inſtances lieth
under ſome <hi>Diſadvantage,</hi> not to ſay ſome
<hi>Scandal.</hi> It is tranſmitted hither from
<hi>France;</hi> and if as in moſt other things that
we take from them, we carry them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Pattern, it ſhould prove ſo in
this, we ſhould get into a more <hi>partial</hi> ſtile
than the principles of Engliſh Juſtice will
I hope ever allow us to be guilty of.</p>
                  <p>The French King's <hi>Equivalents</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
are very <hi>extraordinary Bargains;</hi> his
manner of propoſing and obtaining them is
very differing from the uſual methods of
<hi>equal</hi> dealing. In a later inſtance, <hi>Denmark,</hi>
by the encouragement as well as by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>France,</hi> hath propos'd things to the
Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> which are called <hi>Equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi>
but that they are ſo, the World is
not yet ſufficiently convinc'd, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the Parties concern'd do not think
them to be ſo, and conſequently do not
appear to be at all diſpoſed to accept them.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52156:109"/>
Princes enjoyn and preſcribe ſuch things
when they have <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the want of <hi>Arguments;</hi> and according
to practice in theſe Caſes, the weaker are
never thought to have an <hi>ill Bargain,</hi> if
they have <hi>any thing</hi> left them. So that the
firſt Qualification of an <hi>Equivalent,</hi> muſt
be, that the Appraiſers be <hi>indifferent,</hi> elſe
it is only a <hi>Sound,</hi> there can be nothing
<hi>real</hi> in it: For, where the ſame party that
<hi>propoſeth</hi> a Bargain, claimeth a Right to ſet
the <hi>Value;</hi> or which is worſe, hath <hi>power</hi>
too to make it good, the other may be
forced to <hi>ſubmit</hi> to the Conditions, but he
can by no means ever be perſwaded to
<hi>treat</hi> upon them.</p>
                  <p>IV. The next thing to be conſider'd is
that to make an <hi>Equivalent</hi> in reality an
equal thing in the Propoſer, it muſt be a
<hi>better</hi> thing than that which is required
by him; <hi>juſt as good</hi> is ſubject to the hazard
of not being <hi>quite ſo good:</hi> It is not eaſie
to have ſuch an even hand as to make the
Value exactly equal; beſides, according to
the Maxim in Law, <hi>Melior conditio poſſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
the Offer is not fair, except the thing
offered is better in value than the thing
demanded. There muſt be allowance for
removing what is fixed, and there muſt be
ſomething that may be a juſtification for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52156:109"/>
                     <hi>changing.</hi> The value of things very often
dependeth more upon other circumſtances,
than upon what is meerly intrinſick to
them; therefore the calculation muſt be
made upon that foot, perhaps in moſt
caſes; and particularly the <hi>want</hi> which one
of the parties may have of the thing he
requireth, maketh it more valuable to <hi>him</hi>
than it is in <hi>it ſelf.</hi> If the party <hi>propoſing</hi>
doth not want the thing he would have in
Exchange, his requiring it is <hi>Impertinent:</hi>
If he doth, his want of it muſt go <hi>into</hi> the
appraiſement, and by conſequence every
Propoſer of an <hi>Equivalent</hi> muſt offer a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
thing, or elſe he muſt not take it unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be refuſed, except the other party
hath an <hi>equal want</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> thing, which
is very improbable, ſince naturally he that
vanteth moſt will ſpeak firſt.</p>
                  <p>V. Another thing neceſſary to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a fair Bargain is, that let the parties
who treat, be they never ſo unequal in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
yet as to the particular thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
there muſt be an <hi>exact equality,</hi> as far
as it relateth to the full Liber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y of <hi>taking</hi> or
<hi>refusing, concurring</hi> or <hi>objecting,</hi> without any
conſequence of Revenge, or ſo much as Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction;
for it is impoſſible to <hi>treat</hi>
where it is an Affront to <hi>dliffer;</hi> in that caſe
there is no mean between the two extreams,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52156:110"/>
either an open Quarrel or an intire Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>Bargaining</hi> muſt be equal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
elſe the Bargain <hi>it ſelf</hi> cannot be ſo: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the Propoſer is not only to uſe <hi>equal</hi>
terms as to the <hi>matter,</hi> but <hi>fair</hi> ones in the
<hi>manner</hi> too. There muſt be no intimations
of <hi>Anger</hi> in caſe of <hi>refuſal,</hi> much leſs any
open <hi>Threatning.</hi> Such a Stile is ſo ill sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the uſual way of Treating, that it
looketh more like a Breach of the Peace,
than the making a Bargain. It would be
yet more improper and leſs agreeing with
the nature of an <hi>Equivalent,</hi> if whilſt two
Men are chaffering about the <hi>Price,</hi> one of
them ſhould actually take the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
at his <hi>own rate,</hi> and afterwards deſire
to have his poſſeſſion <hi>confirmed</hi> by a formal
Agreement; ſuch a proceeding would not
only <hi>deſtroy</hi> that <hi>particular</hi> contract, but
make it impoſſible to have any <hi>other,</hi> with
the party that could be guilty of ſuch a
practice.</p>
                  <p>VI. <hi>Violence</hi> preceding deſtroyeth all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and even thô the party that offereth
it ſhould have a right to the thing he ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
yet it is to be obtained by <hi>legal</hi> means,
elſe it may be <hi>forfeited</hi> by his <hi>irregularity</hi> in
the purſuit of it: The <hi>Law</hi> is ſuch an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to <hi>Violence,</hi> and ſo little to be reconciled
to it, that in the Caſe of a <hi>Rape,</hi> the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52156:110"/>
is not taken off though the party
injured afterwards <hi>conſenteth.</hi> The Juſtice
of the Law hath its eye upon the firſt act,
and the Maxim of <hi>Volenti non fit injurial,</hi>
doth not in this caſe help the Offender, it
being a plea <hi>ſubſequent</hi> to the Crime, which
maketh it to be rejected as a thing wrong
dated and out of time.</p>
                  <p>In taking away Goods or Money it is
the ſame thing. The party robbed, by <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
them afterwards to the taker, does not
exempt him from the Punishment of the
<hi>Violence:</hi> Quite contrary, the Man from
whom they were taken is puniſhable, if he
doth not <hi>proſecute.</hi> If the caſe ſhould be,
that a Man thus taking away a thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
price, claimeth a <hi>right</hi> to take it, then
whether it is well or ill founded is not the
Question; but ſure, the party from whom
it is ſo taken, whilſt he is treating to <hi>Sell</hi>
or <hi>Exchange</hi> it, can never make a Bargain
with ſo <hi>orbitrary</hi> a Chapman, there being
no room left after that to talk of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
                  <p>VII. To make an equal Bargain there muſt
be a liberty of <hi>differing,</hi> not only in every
thing that is <hi>really eſſential,</hi> but in every
thing that is <hi>thought ſo</hi> by <hi>either</hi> party, and
moſt eſpecially by him who is in <hi>poſſeſſion</hi>
of the thing demanded: His <hi>Opinion</hi> muſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52156:111"/>
be a <hi>Rule</hi> to him, and even his <hi>Miſtake</hi> in
the Value, though it may not convince
the Man he hath to deal with, yet he will
be juſtified for <hi>not accepting</hi> what is offered,
till that <hi>Miſtake</hi> is fairly rectified and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled.</p>
                  <p>When a <hi>Security</hi> is deſired to be <hi>changed,</hi>
that ſide which <hi>deſireth</hi> it muſt not pretend
to <hi>impoſe</hi> upon the other, ſo as to dictate
to them, and tell them without debate,
that they are <hi>ſafe</hi> in what is propoſed, ſince
of that the Counſel on the <hi>other ſide</hi> muſt
certainly be the moſt <hi>competent Judges.</hi>
The <hi>hand</hi> it cometh <hi>from</hi> is a great Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
either to invite or diſcourage in all
matters of Contract: the Qualifications of
the <hi>Party offering</hi> muſt ſute with the <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
it ſelf, elſe let it be never ſo fair,
there is ground for <hi>Suſpicion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VIII. When Men are of a temper, that
they think they have <hi>wrong</hi> done them, if
they have not always the <hi>better</hi> ſide of a
<hi>Bargain:</hi> If they happen to be ſuch as by
experience have been found to have an <hi>ill
Memory</hi> for their <hi>Word.</hi> If the Character
they bear, doth not recommend their <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi>
where-ever their <hi>Intereſt</hi> is concern'd.
In theſe caſes, thinking Men will avoid deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not only to prevent <hi>ſurprize,</hi> but to
cut off the occaſions of <hi>difficulty</hi> or <hi>diſpute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52156:111"/>
It is yet <hi>more diſcouraging,</hi> when there
are, either a <hi>precedent</hi> Practice, or <hi>ſtanding</hi>
Maxims of <hi>groſs Partiality,</hi> in aſſuming a
privilege of <hi>exemption</hi> from the uſual
methods of <hi>equal</hi> dealing.</p>
                  <p>To illuſtrate this by an Inſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that in any caſe, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
ſhould have an <hi>Intereſt</hi> to promote a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
let her <hi>way of dealing</hi> be a little
examin'd, which will direct thoſe with
whom ſhe treateth, how far they are to
rely upon what <hi>ſhe propoſeth</hi> to them. We
may begin with the Quality in the World,
the leaſt conſiſting with equal dealing,
<hi>viz.</hi> An incurable <hi>Partiality</hi> to <hi>herſelf;</hi>
which, that it may arrive to its full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
is crowned with <hi>Infallibility.</hi> At
the firſt ſetting out, ſhe maketh her ſelf
uncapable of dealing upon terms of <hi>Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
by the Power ſhe claimeth of <hi>binding</hi>
and <hi>looſing,</hi> which hath been ſo often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to <hi>Treaties,</hi> as well as to <hi>Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the definition of <hi>Juſtice</hi> is to deal <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
ſhe cannot be guilty of it without <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
her Prerogative,</hi> and according to
her Principles, ſhe giveth up the Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
derived to her by <hi>Apoſtolical Succeſſion,</hi> if
ſhe degradeth her ſelf ſo as to be judged
by the Rules of <hi>common Right,</hi> eſpecially of
the Bargain ſhould be with <hi>Hereticks,</hi> who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52156:112"/>
in her Opinion have <hi>forfeited</hi> the claim
they might otherwiſe have had to it.</p>
                  <p>IX. Beſides, her Taſte hath been ſo ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>unreaſonable Bargains,</hi> that ſhe can
never bring down her Palate to any thing
that is <hi>fair</hi> or <hi>equal.</hi> She hath not only
judg'd it an <hi>Equivalent,</hi> but a <hi>great Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain</hi>
for the other ſide, to give them <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions</hi>
and <hi>Indulgence</hi> for the <hi>real Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of great Sums, for which ſhe hath
drawn Bills to have them repayed with
Intereſt in <hi>Purgatory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Spiritual Bank</hi> hath carried on ſuch
a Trade upon theſe <hi>advantageous Terms,</hi>
that it can never ſubmit to the ſmall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
an <hi>ordinary Bargain</hi> would produce.</p>
                  <p>The ſeveral Popes have in exchange for
the <hi>Peter-Pence,</hi> and all their other <hi>Rents</hi>
and <hi>Fines</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> ſent <hi>ſanctified
Roſes, Reliques,</hi> and other ſuch Wonder-working
Trifles. And by virtue of their
Character of <hi>Holy Fathers,</hi> have uſed
Princes like <hi>Children,</hi> by ſending them ſuch
<hi>Rattles</hi> to play with, which they made
them buy at extravagant Rates; beſides
which, they were to be <hi>thankful</hi> too, in to
the bargain.</p>
                  <p>A Chip of the Croſs, a piece of St. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>'s
Grid-iron, a Hair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> have
been thought <hi>Equivalents,</hi> for much more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52156:112"/>
                     <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> things. The Popes being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Jewel-Houſe, have ſet the <hi>Rates</hi>
upon them, and they have paſſed; though
the whole Shop would not take up the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of a Bodkin in <hi>Lombardſtreet</hi> upon the
credit of them.</p>
                  <p>They are <hi>unconſcionable Purchaſers,</hi> for
they get all the Money from the <hi>living</hi> by
praying for them when they are <hi>dead.</hi>
And it is obſervable, that the Northern part
of Chriſtendom, which beſt underſtandeth
<hi>Trade,</hi> were the firſt that <hi>refuſed</hi> to make
any more Bargains with them; ſo that it
looketh as if the chief quarrel to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks</hi>
was not as they were <hi>ill Chriſtians,</hi>
but as they were <hi>unkind Merchants,</hi> in ſo
diſcourteouſly rejecting the Commodities
of the growth of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude this Head, There is no bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
with <hi>Infallibility,</hi> it being ſo much
<hi>above Equality,</hi> that it cannot bear the
Indignity of a <hi>true Equivalent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>X. In all Bargains there is a neceſſity
of looking back, and reflecting how far
a <hi>preſent propoſal</hi> is reconcilable with
<hi>former practice;</hi> For Example, if at any
time a thing is offered, quite <hi>differing</hi>
from the <hi>Arguments</hi> uſed by the Propoſer,
and <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>Maxims</hi> held out
by him at <hi>other</hi> times. Or in a Publick
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52156:113"/>
caſe, if the <hi>ſame</hi> men who promote and
preſs a thing with the <hi>utmoſt violence,</hi> do
in a little time after with as <hi>much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
preſs the <hi>contrary,</hi> and profeſs a <hi>det<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtation</hi>
of the <hi>very thing,</hi> for which they
had before imployed <hi>all</hi> their <hi>Intereſt</hi> and
<hi>Authority.</hi> Or if in the caſe of a Law
<hi>already</hi> made, there ſhould be a privilege
claimed to <hi>exempt</hi> thoſe from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of obſerving it, who yet ſhould <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
deſire</hi> and <hi>preſs</hi> to have a <hi>new Law</hi>
made in exchange for the <hi>old</hi> one, by which
they would not be bound; and that they
ſhould propoſe a <hi>ſecurity</hi> by a thing of the
very <hi>ſame nature</hi> as that which they did
<hi>not</hi> allow to be any <hi>before.</hi> Theſe <hi>Incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi>
muſt naturally have the effect of
raiſing <hi>ſuſpicion,</hi> or rather they are a <hi>certain
proof,</hi> that in ſuch circumſtances it is <hi>irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>
for men to expect an <hi>effectual Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XI. If whatſoever is more than <hi>ordinary</hi>
is <hi>ſuſpicious,</hi> every thing that is <hi>unnatural</hi>
is <hi>more</hi> ſo: It is only <hi>unneceſſary</hi> but
<hi>unnatural</hi> too to <hi>perſwade</hi> with <hi>violence</hi> what
it is <hi>folly</hi> to <hi>refuſe;</hi> to <hi>puſh</hi> men with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
into a <hi>good</hi> bargain for <hi>themſelves,</hi> is a
ſtile very much unſuitable to the <hi>nature</hi>
of the thing. But it goeth further and
is yet more abſurd, to grow <hi>angry</hi> with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52156:113"/>
men for <hi>not</hi> receiving propoſal that is for
their <hi>advantage;</hi> Men ought to be content
with the Generoſity of <hi>offering</hi> good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains,
and ſhould give their <hi>compaſſion</hi> to
thoſe who do <hi>not underſtand</hi> them: but by
carrying their good nature ſo far as to be
<hi>Cholerick</hi> in ſuch a caſe, they would follow
the example of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> where
the definition of <hi>Charity</hi> is very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.
In her Language, the Writ <hi>de Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retico
Comburendo</hi> is a <hi>Love letter,</hi> and <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
men for differing with them in Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
howſoever miſcalled <hi>Cruelty,</hi> is as they
underſtand it, the <hi>perfection</hi> of <hi>flaming Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Anger</hi> in theſe caſes laſteth <hi>long,</hi>
it is moſt probable that it is for our <hi>own
ſakes;</hi> Good nature for <hi>others</hi> is one of
thoſe Diſeaſes that is <hi>cured</hi> by <hi>time,</hi> and
eſpecially where it is <hi>offered</hi> and <hi>rejected;</hi>
but for <hi>our ſelves</hi> it <hi>never faileth,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be exſtinguiſhed but with our life. It is
fair if men can believe that their friends
love them <hi>next</hi> to themſelves, to love them
<hi>better</hi> is too much; the Expreſſion is ſo
<hi>unnatural</hi> that it is <hi>cloying,</hi> and men muſt
have no <hi>ſenſe,</hi> who in this caſe have no
<hi>ſuspicion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XII<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Another Circumſtance neceſſary to
a <hi>fair</hi> bargain is, That there muſt be <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52156:114"/>
and <hi>freedom</hi> allowed, as the effect of
that <hi>Equality</hi> which is the foundation of
Contracting. There muſt be full liberty
of <hi>objecting,</hi> and making <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>ſcr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ples:</hi>
If they are ſuch as can be <hi>anſwered,</hi> the
party convinced is ſo much the more <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed</hi>
and <hi>incouraged</hi> to deal, inſtead of
being hindred by them; but if inſtead of
an <hi>anſwer</hi> to ſatisfy, there is nothing but
<hi>anger</hi> for a reply, it is impoſſible not to
conclude that there is never a good one to
give; ſo that the objection <hi>remaining</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being fully <hi>confuted,</hi> there is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<hi>bar</hi> put to any further Treaty.</p>
                  <p>There can be no dealing where one ſide
aſſumeth a privilege to <hi>impoſe,</hi> ſo as to make
an <hi>offer</hi> and not bear the <hi>examination</hi> of it,
this is giving <hi>judgment</hi> not making a <hi>bargain.</hi>
Where it is called <hi>unmannerly</hi> to <hi>object,</hi> or
<hi>criminal</hi> to <hi>refuſe,</hi> the ſureſt way is for men
to ſtay where they are, rather than treat
upon ſuch diſadvantage.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould happen to be in any Country
where the governing power ſhould allow
men <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> in the choice of
their <hi>Religion,</hi> it would be ſtrange to deny
them <hi>liberty of ſpeech</hi> in making a <hi>bargain.</hi>
Such a contradiction would be ſo diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they muſt be <hi>unreaſonably ſanguine,</hi>
who in that caſe can entertain the hopes
of a <hi>fair Equivalent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52156:114"/>
XIII. And <hi>equal</hi> Bargain muſt not be a
<hi>Myſtery</hi> nor a <hi>Secret.</hi> The purchaſer or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer
is to tell <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>plainly,</hi> what
it is he intendeth to give in Exchange for
that which he requireth. It muſt be <hi>view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
and <hi>conſidered</hi> by the <hi>other</hi> party, that
he may judge of the value; for without
<hi>knowing</hi> what it is, he cannot determine
whether he ſhall <hi>take</hi> or <hi>leave</hi> it. An aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
in <hi>general,</hi> that it ſhall be as <hi>good</hi>
or a <hi>better</hi> things, is not in this a <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
excuſe for the miſtake of dealing upon
ſuch <hi>uncertain</hi> terms. In all things that are
dark and not enough explained, <hi>ſuſpicion</hi>
naturally followeth: A <hi>ſecret</hi> generally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
a <hi>defect</hi> or a <hi>deceit;</hi> and if a <hi>falſe
light</hi> is an objection, <hi>no light</hi> at all is yet
a greater. To pretend to give a <hi>better</hi>
thing, and to refuſe to <hi>ſhew</hi> it, is very near
ſaying it is <hi>not ſo good</hi> a one; at leaſt ſo it
will be taken in common conſtruction.
A <hi>Myſtery</hi> is yet a more diſcouraging
thing to a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> eſpecially if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
ſhould come from a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> it being
one of his great Objections to that Church,
that there are ſo many of them <hi>Inviſible</hi>
and <hi>Impoſſible,</hi> which are ſo violently thruſt
upon their underſtandings, that they are
overlaid with them. They think that <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
creatures</hi> are to be convinced only by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52156:115"/>
                     <hi>reaſon,</hi> and that <hi>reaſon</hi> muſt be <hi>viſible</hi> and
<hi>freely expoſed;</hi> elſe they will think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
uſed with <hi>contempt</hi> inſtead of <hi>equality,</hi>
and will never allow ſuch a <hi>ſuſpected ſecrecy</hi>
to be a fit preface to a <hi>real Equivalent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XIV. In matters of Contract not only
the <hi>preſent</hi> value, but the <hi>contingences</hi> and
<hi>conſequences,</hi> as far as they can be fairly
ſuppoſed, are to be conſidered. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
if there ſhould be <hi>poſſibility,</hi> that
one of the Parties may be <hi>ruined</hi> by <hi>accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and the other only <hi>diſappointed</hi> by his
<hi>refuſing;</hi> the conſequences are ſo extreamly
<hi>unequal,</hi> that it is not imaginable, a man
ſhould take that for an <hi>Equivalent,</hi> which
hath ſuch a <hi>fatal poſſibility</hi> at the heels of it.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould happen in a <hi>publick</hi> caſe, that
ſuch a propoſal ſhould come from the <hi>minor</hi>
part of an Aſſembly or Nation, to the
<hi>greater;</hi> It is very juſt, that the <hi>hazard</hi> of
ſuch a <hi>poſſibility</hi> ſhould more or leſs likely
fall upon the <hi>leſſer</hi> part, rather than upon
the <hi>greater;</hi> for <hi>whoſe ſake</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi>
things are and muſt be calculated in all
<hi>publick Conſtitutions.</hi> Suppoſe in any mixed
Government, the <hi>chief Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould
propoſe upon a condition, in the <hi>Senate,
Diet,</hi> or other <hi>Supreme Aſſembly,</hi> either to
Enact or Abrogate one or more Laws, by
which a <hi>poſſibility</hi> might be let in of <hi>deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52156:115"/>
their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Property,</hi> which in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
language ſignifieth no leſs than <hi>Soul</hi> and
<hi>Body;</hi> where could be the <hi>Equivalent</hi> in the
caſe, not only for the <hi>real loſs,</hi> but even
for the <hi>fear of loſing</hi> them? Men can fall
no lower than to <hi>loſe</hi> all, and if <hi>loſing all</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth
them, the <hi>venturing</hi> all muſt <hi>fright</hi>
them.</p>
                  <p>In an inſtance when Men are ſecure;
that how far ſoever they may be over-run
by <hi>Violence,</hi> yet they can never be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
by <hi>Law,</hi> except they give their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
to make it poſſible, though it
ſhould neither be likely nor intended, ſtill
the <hi>conſequence</hi> which <hi>may</hi> happen is too
big for any preſent thing to make amends
for it. Whilſt the world <hi>Poſſible</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
it muſt <hi>forbid</hi> the bargain. Where-ever
it falleth out therefore, that in an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of a public nature, the Chan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing,
Enacting, or Repealing a Law, <hi>may na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi>
tend to the <hi>miſplacing</hi> the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
power in the hands of thoſe who have
a <hi>ſeparate intereſt</hi> from the body of a
People, there can be no treating, till it
is demonſtrably made out, that <hi>ſuch</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
ſhall be <hi>abſolutely impoſſible;</hi> for
if that ſhall be <hi>denied</hi> by thoſe who make
the propoſal, if it is becauſe they <hi>cannot</hi>
do it, the motion at firſt was very <hi>unfair.</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52156:116"/>
If they <hi>can</hi> and <hi>will not,</hi> it would be yet leſs
reaſonable to expect that ſuch <hi>partial</hi> deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
would ever give an <hi>Equivalent</hi> fit to be
<hi>accepted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XV. It is neceſſary in all dealing to
be <hi>aſſured</hi> in the firſt place, that the <hi>party
propoſing</hi> is in a condition to <hi>make good</hi>
his Offer; that he is neither under any <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Obligations</hi> or <hi>pretended Claims,</hi> which
may render him uncapable of performing
it; elſe he is ſo far in the condition of a
<hi>Minor,</hi> that whatever he diſpoſeth by ſale
or exchange may be afterwards reſumed,
and the Contract becometh void, being

legal <hi>power</hi> in him that made it.</p>
                  <p>In the caſe of a ſtrict Settlement, where
the party is only <hi>Tenant</hi> for <hi>life,</hi> there is
no poſſibility of treating which one under
ſuch fetters; no purchaſe or exchange of
Lands or any thing elſe can be good, where
there is ſuch an <hi>incapacity</hi> of making out
a Title; the intereſt veſted in him being
ſo <hi>limited,</hi> that he can do little more than
pronounce the <hi>words</hi> of a Contract, he can
by no means perform the <hi>effect</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>In more <hi>publick</hi> inſtances, the <hi>impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
is yet more expreſs; as ſuppoſe in any
Kingdom, where the <hi>people</hi> have ſo much
liberty left them, as that they may make

Contracts with the <hi>Crown,</hi> there ſhould

to the Royal Function, that no King

leſs to be reconciled to the word <hi>Equivalent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The party that will Contract in ſpight
of ſuch a Claim, is content to <hi>take</hi> what is
<hi>impoſſible</hi> to <hi>grant,</hi> and if he complaineth
of his Diſappointment, he neither <hi>can have</hi>
Remedy, nor <hi>deſerveth</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>If a Right ſo claimed hapneth to be of
ſo <hi>comprehenſive</hi> a <hi>nature,</hi> as that by a clear
inference it may extend to <hi>every thing elſe,</hi>
as well as to the <hi>particular</hi> matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as often as the Supream Magiſtrate
ſhall be ſo diſpoſed, there can in that caſe be
<hi>no treating</hi> with Prerogative that ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all the Right the People can pretend to;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52156:117"/>
and if they have no right to any thing of
which they are poſſeſſed, it is a <hi>Jeſt</hi> and
not a <hi>Bargain,</hi> to obſerve any Formality in
parting with it.</p>
                  <p>A Claim may be ſo ſtated, that by the
<hi>power</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> of <hi>interpreting,</hi> it ſhall
have ſuch a murthering eye, that if it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon a Law, like a <hi>Baſilisk,</hi> it ſhall
ſtrike it dead: Where is the poſſibility of
Treating, where <hi>ſuch a Right is aſſumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
Nay, let it be ſuppoſed that ſuch a Claim
is <hi>not well founded</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> and that upon
a free diſquiſition it could <hi>not be made out;</hi>
yet even in this caſe, none that are well
adviſed will conclude a Bargain, till it is
<hi>fully ſtated</hi> and <hi>cleared,</hi> or indeed, ſo much
as <hi>engage</hi> in a <hi>treaty,</hi> till by way of prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
all <hi>poſſibility</hi> ſhall be <hi>remov'd</hi> of any
trouble or diſpute.</p>
                  <p>XVI. There is a <hi>collateral</hi> circumſtance
in making a Contract, which yet deſerveth
to be conſidered, as much as any thing that
belongeth to it; and that is the <hi>character</hi>
and <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>parties</hi> contracting; if they
treat onely by <hi>themſelves,</hi> and if by <hi>others,</hi> the
<hi>Qualifications</hi> of the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Propoſer</hi> eſpecially, muſt not be ſo
<hi>low</hi> as to want <hi>credit.</hi> nor ſo <hi>raiſed</hi> as to
carry him <hi>above</hi> the reach of <hi>ordinary deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52156:117"/>
In the firſt, There is <hi>ſcandal,</hi> in the
other <hi>danger.</hi> There is no Rule without
ſome Exception, but generally ſpeaking the
<hi>means</hi> ſhould be ſuited to the <hi>end,</hi> and ſince
all Men who treat, pretend an <hi>equal bargain,</hi>
it is deſirable that there may be <hi>equality</hi> in
the <hi>perſons</hi> as well as in the <hi>thing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>manner</hi> of doing things hath ſuch
an influence upon the <hi>matter,</hi> that Men
may gueſs at the <hi>end</hi> by the <hi>inſtruments</hi>
that are uſed to obtain it, who are a very
<hi>good direction</hi> how far to rely upon or
ſuſpect the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of that which is propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
An Abſurdity in the way of <hi>carrying
on</hi> a Treaty, in any <hi>one</hi> Circumſtance, if it
is very groſs, is enough to perſwade a
thinking Man to break off, and take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from ſuch an <hi>ill appearance.</hi> Some
things are ſo glaring that it is impoſſible
not to <hi>ſee,</hi> and conſequently not to <hi>ſuspect</hi>
them; as ſuppoſe in a private caſe, there
ſhould be a Treaty of <hi>Marriage</hi> between
two Honourable Families, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ſide ſhould think fit to ſend a <hi>Woman</hi>
that had been <hi>Carted,</hi> to perſwade the <hi>young
Lady</hi> to an approbation and conſent; the
<hi>unfitneſs</hi> of the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> muſt naturally
diſpoſe the other party to <hi>diſtruſt</hi> the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,</hi>
and to reſiſt the temptation of the
<hi>beſt Match</hi> that could be offered, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52156:118"/>
by <hi>that hand,</hi> and uſhered in by ſuch
a <hi>diſcouraging preliminary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a <hi>publick</hi> inſtance the ſuſpicion ariſing
from <hi>unfit Mediators,</hi> ſtill groweth more
reaſonable in proportion, as the <hi>conſequence</hi>
is much <hi>greater</hi> of being deceived. If a
<hi>Jew</hi> ſhould be employed to ſollicite all ſorts,
of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>unite</hi> and <hi>agree;</hi> the <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi>
of his <hi>profeſſion,</hi> would not allow Men
to ſtay till they heard his Arguments, they
would conclude from his <hi>Religion,</hi> that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Man <hi>himſelf</hi> was <hi>mad,</hi> or that he
thought <hi>thoſe</hi> to be <hi>ſo,</hi> whom he had the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to endeavour to perſwade.</p>
                  <p>Or ſuppoſe an <hi>Adamite</hi> ſhould be very
ſollicitous and active, in all places, and
with all ſorts of Perſons, to ſettle the <hi>Church
of England</hi> in particular, and a fair <hi>Liberty
of Conſcience</hi> for all Diſſenters; though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the World has more to be ſaid for
it than <hi>Naked Truth,</hi> yet if ſuch a Man
ſhould run up and down without Cloaths,
let his Arguments be never ſo good, or his
Commiſſion never ſo Authentick, his <hi>Figure</hi>
would be ſuch a <hi>contradiction</hi> to his <hi>buſineſs,</hi>
that how ſerious ſoever that might be in it
ſelf, <hi>his interpoſition</hi> would make a Jeſt of
it.</p>
                  <p>Though it ſhould not go ſo far as this,
yet if Men have <hi>contrarieties</hi> in their <hi>way of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52156:118"/>
living</hi> not to be reconciled; as if they
ſhould pretend infinite <hi>zeal for liberty,</hi> and
at that time be in great <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>imployed</hi>
by thoſe who will <hi>not endure</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>If they are affectedly <hi>ſingular,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the generality of the World in <hi>no
one</hi> thing, but in playing the <hi>knave.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If <hi>demonſtration</hi> is a familiar word with
them, moſt eſpecially where the thing is

                        </gap>mpoſſible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they quote <hi>Authority</hi> to ſupply their
want of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and juſtifie the value of their
Arguments, not by <hi>reaſon,</hi> but by their
being <hi>paid</hi> for them, (in which, by the
way, thoſe who pay them have probably
a very <hi>melancholy Equivalent.)</hi> If they
brandiſh a <hi>Prince</hi>'s <hi>Word</hi> like a Sword in a
Crowd, to make way for their own <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence;</hi>
and in diſpute, as Criminals former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fled to the <hi>Statue</hi> of the Prince for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary;
if they ſhould now, when baffled,
creep under the protection of a Kings
<hi>Name,</hi> where out of reſpect they are no
farther to be purſued.</p>
                  <p>In theſe caſes; Though the propoſitions
ſhould be <hi>really</hi> good, they will be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by paſſing through ſuch <hi>Conduits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
and it would be a ſufficient <hi>Miſtake</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a <hi>Treaty;</hi> but it would be little leſs
than <hi>Madneſs</hi> from ſuch hands to expect
an <hi>Equivalent.</hi>
                  </p>

XVII. Having touched upon theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
as neceſſary in order to the ſtating
the nature of an <hi>equal Bargain,</hi> and the
Circumſtances belonging to it, let it now
be examined in two or three inſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
what things are <hi>not</hi> to be admitted by way
of Contract, to paſs under the Name of an
<hi>Equivalent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Though it will be allowed, that
in the general corruption of mankind, which
will not admit <hi>Juſtice</hi> alone to be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
tie to make good a Contract, that
a <hi>Puniſhment</hi> added for the breach of
it, is a <hi>fitting</hi> or rather a <hi>neceſſary</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
yet it does not follow, that in <hi>all</hi>
caſes, a <hi>great Penalty</hi> upon the party offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is an <hi>abſolute</hi> and an <hi>entire Security.</hi>
It muſt be conſidered in every particular
caſe, how far the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> may ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
lead a Man to <hi>rely more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> upon
it.</p>
                  <p>In a private inſtance, the <hi>Penalty</hi> inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the breach of Contract muſt be
firſt, ſuch a one as the party injured <hi>can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force,</hi>
and Secondly, ſuch a one as he <hi>will
enforce,</hi> when it is in his power.</p>
                  <p>If the <hi>Offending party</hi> is in a capacity of
<hi>hindring</hi> the other from bringing the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
of the Law upon him. If he hath
<hi>ſtrength</hi> or <hi>privilege</hi> ſufficient to <hi>over rule</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52156:119"/>
the Letter of the Contract; in that caſe,
a <hi>Penalty</hi> is but a <hi>Word,</hi> there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence belonging to it. Secondly, The
<hi>forfeiture</hi> or <hi>puniſhment</hi> muſt be ſuch as the
Man aggrieved will <hi>take;</hi> for Example, if
upon a Bargain, one of the Parties ſhall
ſtipulate to ſubject himſelf, in caſe of his
<hi>failure</hi> to have his <hi>Ears cut,</hi> or his <hi>Noſe ſlit</hi>
by the other, with <hi>ſecurity</hi> given, that he
ſhall not be proſecuted for <hi>executing</hi> this
part of the Agreement; the <hi>Penalty</hi> is no
doubt <hi>heavy enough</hi> to diſcourage a Man
from breaking his Contract; but on the
other ſide it is of <hi>ſuch a kind,</hi> that the
other how much ſoever he may be provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
will not in cold Blood care to inflict
it. Such an extravagant Clauſe would
ſeem to be made only for <hi>ſhew</hi> and <hi>found,</hi>
and no Man would think himſelf ſafer by a
thing which one way or other is ſure to
prove <hi>ineffectual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a <hi>publick</hi> Caſe, Suppoſe in a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſo conſtituted that a <hi>Law</hi> may be
made in the nature of a <hi>Bargain,</hi> it is in <hi>it
ſelf</hi> no more than a <hi>dead letter,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> is
given to it by the <hi>execution</hi> of what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth;
ſo that let it in it ſelf be never ſo
perfect, it <hi>dependeth</hi> upon thoſe who are
intruſted with ſeeing it <hi>obſerved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52156:120"/>
If it is in any Country, where the <hi>chief
Magiſtrate</hi> chuſeth the <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi>
interpret the <hi>Laws;</hi> a <hi>Penalty</hi> in any
one particular Law can have no effect but
what is <hi>precarious.</hi> It may have a <hi>loud voice</hi>
to threaten, but it has not an <hi>hand</hi> to give
a blow; for as long as the Governing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is in poſſeſſion of this Prerogative, let
who will chuſe the <hi>Meat,</hi> if they chuſe the
<hi>Cooks,</hi> it is they that will give the <hi>taſt</hi> to
it. So that it is clear that the <hi>rigour</hi> of a
<hi>Penalty</hi> will not in all caſes <hi>fix</hi> a <hi>Bargain,</hi>
neither is it Univerſally a true Poſition,
that the increaſe of <hi>puniſhment</hi> for the breach
of a <hi>new Law,</hi> is an <hi>Equivalent</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to part with an <hi>old</hi> one.</p>
                  <p>XVIII. In moſt Bargains there is a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the <hi>time to come,</hi> which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be conſidered as well as that which
cometh within the compaſs of the <hi>preſent</hi>
valuation.</p>
                  <p>Where the <hi>party Contracting,</hi> hath not a
<hi>full power</hi> to diſpoſe what belongeth to
him or them in <hi>Reverſion,</hi> who ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
after him in his Right; he cannot
make any part of what is ſo <hi>limited,</hi> to be
the <hi>condition</hi> of the Contract. Further, he
cannot enjoyn the <hi>Heir</hi> or <hi>Succeſſor</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
the exerciſe of any Right that is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent</hi>
to him, as he is a Man; neither can
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52156:120"/>
he <hi>reſtrain</hi> him without his own conſent,
from doing any act which in it ſelf is <hi>lawful,</hi>
and liable to <hi>no objection.</hi> For Example, A
<hi>Father</hi> cannot ſtipulate with any other Man,
that in Conſideration of ſuch a thing done,
or to be done, his <hi>Son</hi> ſhall <hi>never Marry;</hi>
becauſe Marriage is an Inſtitution <hi>Eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed</hi>
by the Laws of God, and Man, and
therefore no body can be ſo reſtrained by
any power from doing <hi>ſuch</hi> an act, when
he thinketh fit, being <hi>warranted</hi> by an
Authority that is not to be controuled.</p>
                  <p>XIX. Now as there are <hi>Rights inherent</hi>
in Mens perſons in their <hi>ſingle capacities,</hi>
there are <hi>Rights</hi> as much <hi>fixed</hi> to the <hi>Body
Politick,</hi> which is a Creature that never
dieth. For inſtance, There can be no
Government without a <hi>Supreme Power,</hi> that
Power is not always in the <hi>ſame</hi> hands, it
is in <hi>different</hi> ſhapes and dreſſes, but ſtill
where-ever it is lodged, it muſt be <hi>unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi>
It hath a juriſdiction over every thing
<hi>elſe,</hi> but it cannot have it above <hi>it ſelf. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power</hi> can no more be <hi>limited</hi> than
<hi>Infinity</hi> can be <hi>meaſured;</hi> becauſe it ceaſeth
to be the thing; its very being is diſſolved,
when any bounds can be put to it.</p>
                  <p>Where this Supreme Power is <hi>mixed,</hi> or
<hi>divided,</hi> the <hi>ſhape</hi> only <hi>differeth,</hi> the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is ſtill the <hi>ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52156:121"/>
The preſent State of <hi>Venice</hi> cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
thoſe who ſucceed them in the ſame
power, from having an entire and unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Sovereignty; they may indeed make
<hi>preſent Laws</hi> which ſhall retrench their
<hi>preſent Power,</hi> if they are ſo diſpoſed, and
thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> if not <hi>repealed</hi> by the <hi>ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
that enacted them, are to be <hi>obſerved</hi>
by the ſucceeding Senate till they think
ſit to Abrogate them, and no longer; for
if the Supreme Power ſhall ſtill reſide in the
Senate, perhaps compoſed of <hi>other</hi> Men,
or of <hi>other</hi> minds (which will be ſufficient)
the neceſſary conſequence is, that <hi>one</hi>
Senate muſt have as mach right to <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſuch a Law, as <hi>another</hi> could have to
<hi>make</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>XX. Suppoſe the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> in any
State ſhould make a <hi>Law,</hi> to enjoyn all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
Law-makers to take an <hi>Oath</hi> never
to <hi>alter it,</hi> it would produce theſe following
Abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, All <hi>Supreme Power</hi> being inſtituted
to promote the <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>benefit,</hi> and to
prevent the <hi>prejudice</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> which may
fall upon thoſe who live under the <hi>protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of it; the <hi>conſequence</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Oath</hi>
would be, that all Men who are ſo truſted,
ſhall take God to witneſs, that ſuch a
Law once made, being judged <hi>at the time</hi>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:52156:121"/>
to be <hi>advantageous</hi> for the publick, though
<hi>afterwards</hi> by the viciſſitude of times, or
the variety of accidents or intereſts, it
ſhould plainly appear to them to be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive,</hi>
they will ſuffer it to have its
courſe, and will never repeal it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If there could in any Nation
be found a <hi>ſet of Men,</hi> who having a
<hi>part</hi> in the <hi>Supreme</hi> legiſlative <hi>Power,</hi> ſhould
as much as in them lieth, betray their
Country by ſuch a criminal engagement,
ſo <hi>directly oppoſite</hi> to the <hi>nature</hi> of their
<hi>Power,</hi> and to the <hi>Truſt</hi> repoſed in them.
If theſe Men have their power only for <hi>life,</hi>
when they are dead ſuch an Oath can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<hi>no farther;</hi> and tho that would be
<hi>too long</hi> a Leaſe for the life of ſuch a
<hi>Monſter</hi> as an <hi>Oath ſo compoſed,</hi> yet it muſt
<hi>then</hi> certainly give up the Ghoſt. It
could bind none but the <hi>firſt</hi> makers of
it, <hi>another</hi> generation would never be tied
up by it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In thoſe Countries where the
<hi>Supreme Aſſemblies</hi> are not conſtant <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Courts, but called together upon <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi>
and Compoſed of ſuch as the People
chuſe for <hi>that time</hi> only, with a Truſt and
Character that remaineth no longer with
them than till that Aſſembly is <hi>regularly
diſſolved,</hi> ſuch an Oath taken by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52156:122"/>
of a Senate, Diet, or other Aſſembly
to choſen, can have very little effect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
at the <hi>next meeting</hi> there may be
quite <hi>another ſet of Men</hi> who will be under
<hi>no Obligation</hi> of that kind. The eternity
intended to that Law by thoſe that made
it, will be cut off by <hi>new Men</hi> who ſhall
ſucceed them in their power, if they have
a <hi>differing Taſte,</hi> or another <hi>Intereſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XXI. To put it yet farther, Suppoſe
a Clauſe in ſuch a Law, that it ſhall be
<hi>criminal</hi> in the laſt degree for any Man
choſen in a ſubſequent Aſſembly, to <hi>propoſe</hi>
the <hi>repealing</hi> of it; and ſince nothing can be
<hi>Enacted</hi> which is not firſt <hi>propoſed,</hi> by this
means it ſeemeth as if a Law might be
Created which ſhould <hi>never die.</hi> But let
this be Examined.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſuch a clauſe would be ſo <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive</hi> to the <hi>being</hi> of ſuch a Conſtitution,
as that it would be as reaſonable to ſay, that
a King had right to <hi>give</hi> or <hi>ſell</hi> his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to a <hi>foreign Prince,</hi> as that any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Men who are <hi>entruſted</hi> with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power, or any part of it, ſhould
have a right to <hi>impoſe</hi> ſuch Shackles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon
the Liberty of thoſe who are to <hi>ſucceed</hi>
them in the <hi>ſame Truſt.</hi> The ground of
that <hi>Truſt</hi> is, that every Man who is choſen
into ſuch an Aſſembly, is to do all that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52156:122"/>
in him lieth for the <hi>good</hi> of thoſe who <hi>choſe</hi>
him: The Engliſh of ſuch a Clauſe would
be, that he is <hi>not</hi> to do his <hi>beſt</hi> for thoſe
that <hi>choſe</hi> him, becauſe though he ſhould
be <hi>convinc'd</hi> that it might be very <hi>fatal</hi> to
<hi>continue</hi> that <hi>Law,</hi> and therefore very <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
to <hi>repeal</hi> it, yet he muſt not repeal
it, becauſe it is made a <hi>Crime,</hi> and attended
with a <hi>Penalty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, to ſhew the <hi>emptineſs</hi> as
well as <hi>injuſtice</hi> of ſuch a Clauſe, it is clear,
that although ſuch an Invaſion of Right
ſhould be impoſed, it will never be obeyed:
There will only be <hi>Deformity,</hi> in the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
it will neither <hi>ſting</hi> nor <hi>bite.</hi> Such
<hi>Law-givers</hi> would only have the honour
of attempting a <hi>contradiction</hi> which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have any ſucceſs; for as ſuch a <hi>Law</hi>
in it ſelf would be a <hi>Madneſs,</hi> ſo the <hi>Penalty</hi>
would be a <hi>Jeſt;</hi> which may be thus made
out.</p>
                  <p>XXII. A Law that carrieth in it ſelf <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
enough to <hi>ſupport</hi> it, is ſo far from want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>protection</hi> of ſuch a Clauſe, or from
<hi>needing</hi> to take ſuch an <hi>extraordinary receipt</hi>
for long Life, that the <hi>admitting</hi> it muſt
certainly be the <hi>likelieſt</hi> and the <hi>ſhorteſt</hi>
way to <hi>deſtroy</hi> it; ſuch a Clauſe in a Law
muſt imply an opinion that the <hi>greateſt</hi>
part of mankind is <hi>againſt</hi> it, ſince it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52156:123"/>
ſuch an exorbitance ſhould be done
for its <hi>own ſake;</hi> the end of it muſt be to
<hi>force</hi> Men by a <hi>Penalty,</hi> to that which they
could <hi>not</hi> be <hi>perſwaded</hi> to, whilſt their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is left at <hi>liberty.</hi> This Poſition being
granted, which I think can hardly be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
put the caſe that a Law ſhould be made
with this <hi>imaginary</hi> Clauſe of <hi>Immortality,</hi>
after which another <hi>Aſſembly</hi> is choſen, and
if the majority of the <hi>Electors</hi> ſhall be <hi>againſt</hi>
this Law, the greater part of the <hi>Elected</hi>
muſt be <hi>ſo</hi> too, if the choice is fair and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular;
which muſt be preſumed, ſince the
ſuppoſition of the contrary is not to come
within this Argument. When theſe Men
ſhall meet, the <hi>Majority</hi> will be viſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
of thoſe who are <hi>againſt</hi> ſuch a
Law, ſo that there will be no <hi>hazard</hi> to any
ſingle Man in propoſing the <hi>Repeal</hi> of it,
when he cannot be <hi>puniſhed</hi> but by the
<hi>Majority,</hi> and he hath ſuch a kind of aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
as cometh near a Demonſtration, that
the <hi>greater Number</hi> will be of his mind,
and conſequently, that for their own ſakes
they <hi>will ſecure</hi> him from any danger.</p>
                  <p>For theſe Reaſons, where-ever in order
to the making a Bargain, a Proposition is
advanc'd to make a <hi>new Law,</hi> which is to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ye up thoſe who neither <hi>can</hi> nor <hi>will be
bound</hi> by it, it may be a good <hi>Jeſt,</hi> but it
will never be a good <hi>Equivalent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52156:123"/>
XXIII. In the laſt place, let it be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
how far a <hi>Promiſe</hi> ought to be taken
far a <hi>Security</hi> in a Bargain.</p>
                  <p>There is great Variety of Methods for
the <hi>Security</hi> of thoſe that deal, according
to their <hi>Diſpoſitions</hi> and <hi>Intereſts;</hi> ſome are
<hi>binding,</hi> others inducing circumſtances, and
are to be ſo diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Ready Payment</hi> is without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſo of that there can be no diſpute; in
default of that, the <hi>good Opinion</hi> Men may
have of one another is a great ingredient
to ſupply the want of <hi>immediate</hi> Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.
Where the Truſt is grounded upon
<hi>Inclination</hi> only, the Generoſity is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<hi>return'd;</hi> but where it ſpringeth from
a <hi>long Experience</hi> it is a better foundation,
and yet that is not always <hi>ſecure.</hi> In ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
dealing, <hi>one Promiſe</hi> may be an <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent</hi>
to <hi>another,</hi> but it is not ſo for a
thing <hi>actually</hi> granted or conveyed; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if the thing required in exchange for
it, is of great <hi>value,</hi> either in <hi>it ſelf</hi> or in
its <hi>conſequences.</hi> A <hi>bare</hi> Promiſe as a <hi>ſingle
Security</hi> in ſuch a caſe is not an <hi>equal</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal;
if it is offered by way of <hi>addition,</hi>
it generally giveth cauſe to doubt the Title
is crazy, where ſo <hi>ſlender</hi> a thing is brought
in to be a <hi>ſupplement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:52156:124"/>
XXIV. The <hi>Earneſt</hi> of making good a
Promiſe, muſt be ſuch a behaviour <hi>preceding;</hi>
as may encourage the party to whom it is
made to depend upon it: Where inſtead
of that, there hath been <hi>want of Kindneſs;</hi>
and which is worſe an <hi>Invaſion</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> a
Promiſe hath no perſwading force; and till
the <hi>Objection</hi> to ſuch a Proceeding is <hi>forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
(which can only be the work of time)
and the Skin is a little grown over the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
part, the Wound muſt not be touch'd.
There muſt be ſome <hi>Intermiſſion</hi> at leaſt to
abate the ſmart of <hi>unkind uſage,</hi> or elſe a
Promiſe in the Eye of the party injur'd is ſo
far from <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> a Security, that it
raiſeth more <hi>doubts,</hi> and giveth more juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
cauſe <hi>ſuſpect</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Word</hi> is not like a Bone, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
broken and well ſet again, is ſaid to
be ſometimes ſtronger in that very part:
It is far from being ſo in a <hi>Word</hi> given
and <hi>not made good.</hi> Every ſingle Act either
<hi>weakeneth</hi> or <hi>improveth</hi> our Credit with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men; and as an habit of being <hi>juſt</hi>
to our Word will <hi>confirm,</hi> ſo an habit of too
freely <hi>diſpenſing</hi> with it muſt neceſſarily
<hi>deſtroy</hi> it. A <hi>Promiſe</hi> hath its effect to
perſwade a Man to lay ſome weight upon
it, where the <hi>Promiſer</hi> hath not only the
<hi>power,</hi> but may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52156:124"/>
have the <hi>will</hi> of performing it; and further,
that there be no <hi>viſible intereſt</hi> of the party
promiſing to excuſe himſelf from it, or to
evade it.</p>
                  <p>All Obligations are <hi>comparative,</hi> and
where they ſeem to be oppoſite, or between
the greater and the leſſer, which of them
ought to have precedence in all reſpects
every man is apt to be his <hi>own Judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XXV. If it ſhould fall out that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer</hi>
with full <hi>intent</hi> at the <hi>time</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
might by the interposition of <hi>new
Arguments,</hi> or <hi>differing Advice</hi> think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
oblig'd to turn the matter of Conſcience
on the <hi>other</hi> ſide, and ſhould look upon it
to be much a <hi>greater</hi> fault to <hi>keep</hi> his word
than to <hi>break</hi> it; ſuch a Belief will <hi>untye</hi>
the <hi>ſtricteſt Promiſe</hi> that can be made, and
though the Party thus abſolving himſelf
ſhould do it <hi>without</hi> the mixture or tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>private intereſt,</hi> being moved to it
meerly by his <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as then informed;
yet how far ſoever that might diminiſh
the <hi>Fault</hi> in <hi>him,</hi> it would in no degree
leſſen the <hi>inconveniences</hi> to the <hi>party</hi> who
is <hi>diſappointed,</hi> by the breach of an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon which he relyed.</p>
                  <p>XXVI. A <hi>Promiſe</hi> is to be underſtood
in the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> ſenſe of the words,
and to be ſure not in his who <hi>made</hi> it, if it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52156:125"/>
was given as part of a Bargain. That
would be like giving a Man power to <hi>raiſe</hi>
the <hi>value</hi> of his Money in the payment of
his <hi>Debt,</hi> by which, tho he paid but half
or leſs, be might pretend according to the
letter to have made good the Contract.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>power</hi> of <hi>interpreting</hi> a Promiſe intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taketh away the <hi>virtue</hi> of it. A Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
who ſhould once aſſume that privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
would ſave himſelf the trouble of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any more Bargains.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtill worſe if this <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over a
Man's <hi>Promiſe,</hi> ſhould be <hi>lodg'd</hi> in hands
that have Power to ſupport ſuch an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Claim;</hi> and if in <hi>other</hi> Caſes, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to deal upon thoſe terms is <hi>adviſable,</hi>
in this it becometh abſolutely <hi>neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>XXVII. There muſt in all reſpects be a full
liberty to <hi>claim</hi> a Promiſe, to make it reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to <hi>take</hi> it in any part of payment; elſe it
would be like agreeing for a <hi>Rent,</hi> and at the
ſame time making if <hi>criminal</hi> to <hi>demand it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>ſuperiority</hi> of <hi>Dignity</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> in the
party promiſing maketh it a more <hi>tender</hi>
thing for the other party to treat upon
that ſecurity. The firſt maketh it a <hi>nice</hi>
thing to <hi>claim,</hi> the latter maketh it a <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult</hi>
thing to <hi>obtain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſome caſes, a <hi>Promiſe</hi> is in the nature
of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and then between <hi>equal</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52156:125"/>
the breach of it will bear a <hi>Suit;</hi> but
where the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the Promiſer is very
much raiſed above the level of <hi>equality,</hi>
there is no Forfeiture to be taken. It is ſo
far from the party grieved his being able
to <hi>ſue</hi> or <hi>recover Damages,</hi> that he will not
be allowed to <hi>explain</hi> or <hi>expoſtulate,</hi> and
inſtead of his being <hi>relieved</hi> againſt the
breach of Promiſe, he will run the hazard
of being <hi>puniſhed</hi> for breach of Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Such a Difficulty is putting all or
part of the Payment in the Fire, where
Men muſt burn their Fingers before they
can come at it.</p>
                  <p>That cannot properly be called <hi>good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which the party to whom it is due
may not receive with <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>ſafety.</hi> It
was a Kings Brother of <hi>England</hi> who refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to lend the Pope money, for this reaſon,
<hi>That he would never take the Bond of one,
upon whom he could not diſtrain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Argument is ſtill <hi>ſtronger</hi> againſt the
Validity of a Promiſe, when the Contract
is made between a <hi>Prince</hi> and a <hi>Subject.</hi>
The very offering a Kings Word in Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
is rather a <hi>threatning</hi> in caſe of refuſal,
than an <hi>inducing</hi> Argument to accept it;
it is <hi>unfair</hi> at <hi>firſt,</hi> and by that giveth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
cauſe to be cautious, eſpecially if a thing
of that <hi>value</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> as a Kings Word
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52156:126"/>
ought to be, ſhould be put into the hands
of <hi>State Brokers</hi> to ſtrike up a Bargain with
it.</p>
                  <p>XXVIII. When God Almighty maketh
Covenants with Mankind, <hi>His Promiſe</hi> is a
<hi>ſufficient Security,</hi> notwithſtanding his <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi>
and his <hi>Power;</hi> becauſe firſt, he
can neither <hi>erre</hi> nor do <hi>injuſtice.</hi> It is the
<hi>only</hi> Exception to his Omnipotence, that
by the Perfection of his <hi>being</hi> he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitated
to do <hi>wrong.</hi> Secondly, at the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
of his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> by the extent of his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
which cannot fail, there is no room
left for the poſſibility of any thing to <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene,</hi>
which might <hi>change</hi> his mind. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he is above the receiving either <hi>Benefit</hi>
or <hi>Inconvenience,</hi> and therefore can have no
<hi>Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Temptation</hi> to vary from his
Word, when once he hath granted it.</p>
                  <p>Now though Princes are God's Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
yet their Commiſſion not being ſo
<hi>large,</hi> as that <hi>theſe Qualifications</hi> are devolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, it is quite another caſe, and
ſince the <hi>offering</hi> a Security implyeth it to
be <hi>examined</hi> by the party to whom it is
propoſed, it muſt not be taken ill that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
are made to it, even though the
Prince himſelf ſhould be the <hi>immediate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52156:131"/>
the ſmooth Language which is
now put on to engage you, theſe new
Friends did not make you their Choice,
but their Refuge: They have ever made
their firſt Courtſhips to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and when they were rejected there
they made their Application to you in the
ſecond place. The Inſtances of this might
be given in all times. I do not repeat
them, becauſe whatſoever is unneceſſary,
muſt be tedious, the truth of this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being ſo plain, as not to admit a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute.
You cannot therefore reaſonably
flatter your ſelves, that there is any Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to you. They never pretended to
allow you any Quarter, but to uſher in Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
for themſelves under that ſhelter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I refer you to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s <hi>Letters,</hi> and
to the <hi>Journals</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> where you
may be convinced, if you can be ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken,
as to doubt; nay, at this very hour,
they can hardly forbear, in the height of
their Courtſhip, to let fall hard Words of
you. So little is Nature to be reſtrained;
it will ſtart out ſometimes, diſdaining to
ſubmit to the Uſurpation of Art and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52156:131"/>
This Alliance, between <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi>
is bringing together the Two
moſt contrary things that are in the World.
The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the allowing Liberty, but by its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
it cannot do it. Wine is not more
expreſly forbid to the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> than
giving Hereticks Liberty to the <hi>Papiſts:</hi>
They are no more able to make good their
Vows to you, than Men married before,
and their Wife alive, can confirm their
Contract with another. The continuance
of their kindneſs, would be a habit of Sin,
of which they are to repent, and their
Abſolution is to be had upon no other
terms, than their promiſe to deſtroy you.
You are therefore to be hugged now, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that you may be the better ſqueezed
it another time. There muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
extraordinary, when the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> ſetteth up Bills, and offereth Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
for tender Conſciences: By all
that hath hitherto appeared, her skill in
Chirurgery lieth chiefly in a quick Hand,
to cut off Limbs; but ſhe is the worſt
at healing, of any that ever pretended
to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52156:132"/>
To come ſo quick from another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream,
is ſuch an unnatural Motion, that
you ought to be upon your Guard; the
other day you were <hi>Sons of Belial:</hi> Now,
you are <hi>Angels of Light.</hi> This is a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
change, and it will be fit for you to
pauſe upon it, before you believe it: If
your Features are not altered, neither is
their Opinion of you, what ever may
be pretended. Do you believe leſs than
you did, that there is Idolatry in the
Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Sure you do not. See
then, how they treat both in Words and
Writing, thoſe who entertain that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Conclude from hence, how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
their Favour is with this ſingle Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
except they give you a Diſpenſation
for this too, and by a <hi>Non Obſtante,</hi> ſecure
you that they will not think the worſe of
you.</p>
                  <p>Think a little how dangerous it is to
build upon a Foundation of Paradoxes.
Popery now is the only Friend to Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and the known Enemy to Perſecution:
The Men of <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Tiverton,</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other Eminent for Loyalty. The
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52156:132"/>
                     <hi>Quakers</hi> from being declared by the Papiſts
not to be Chriſtians, are now made Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
and taken into their particular
Protection; they are on a ſudden grown
the moſt accompliſhed Men of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
in good Breeding, and give Thanks
with the beſt Grace, in double refined
Language. So that I ſhould not wonder,
though a Man of that Perſwaſion, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpite
of his Hat, ſhould be Maſter of the
Ceremonies. Not to ſay harſher words,
theſe are ſuch very new things, that it is
impoſſible not to ſuſpend our Belief, till
by a little more Experience we may be
inform'd whether they are Realities or
Apparitions: We have been under ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
miſtakes if theſe Opinions are true;
but for the preſent, we are apt to be
incredulous; except we could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that the Prieſts words in this
caſe too, are able to make ſuch a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and effectual change; and that their
Power is not limited to the Sacrament,
but that it extendeth to alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of all other things, as often as
they are ſo deſpoſed.</p>

ſo nothing will be ſaid to expoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men, how ſtrong ſoever the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
may be, or how clear the Proofs
to make it out. A word or two in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
for you better caution, ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:
Suppoſe then, for Argument's ſake,
that the Mediators of this new Alliance,
ſhould be ſuch as have been formerly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in Treaties of the ſame kind, and
there detected to have Acted by Order,
and to have been Impower'd to give En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
and Rewards. Would not
this be an Argument to ſuſpect them?</p>
                  <p>If they ſhould plainly be under En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
to one ſide, their Arguments
to the other ought to be received accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
their fair Pretences are to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as part of their Commiſſion, which
may not improbably give them a Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
in the caſe of Truth, when it may
bring a prejudice upon the Service of thoſe
by whom they are imployed.</p>

If there ſhould be men who having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

Injuſtice be ſuſpected, that a thing

that thoſe who act this Cholerick part,
do not believe themſelves, but only pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue

They might apprehend their Wages would

by incurring the want of a Pardon, have
drawn upon themſelves a neceſſity of an

being Voluntary or Sincere, but are ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of them by the weight of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo Obnoxious.</p>
                  <p>If in the heighth of this great dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
by comparing things, it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
that at this inſtant, there is much
ſurer Friendſhip with thoſe who are ſo
far from allowing Liberty, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
no Living to a Proteſtant under them.
Let the Scene lie in what part of the
World it will, the Argument will come
home, and ſure it will afford ſufficient
ground to ſuſpect. Apparent Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
muſt ſtrike us; neither Nature nor
Reaſon can digeſt them: Self-Flattery, and
the deſire to Deceive our ſelves, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
preſent Appetite, with all their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which is Great, cannot get the better
of ſuch broad Conviction, as ſome things
carry along with them. Will you call
theſe vain and empty Suſpitions? have
you been at all times ſo void of Fears
and Jealouſies as to juſtifie your being
ſo unreaſonably Valiant in having none
upon this occaſion? Such an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52156:135"/>
Courage at this unſeaſonable time,
to ſay no more, is too dangerous a Virtue
to be commended.</p>
                  <p>If then for theſe and a thouſand other
Reaſons, there is cauſe to ſuſpect, ſure
your new Friends are not to dictate to
you, or adviſe you; for inſtance, The
Addreſſes that fly abroad every Week, and
Murther us with <hi>another to the ſame;</hi> the
firſt Draughts are made by thoſe who
are not very proper to be Secretaries to
the Proteſtant Religion: and it is your
part only to Write them our fairer
again.</p>
                  <p>Strange! that you who have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
ſo much againſt <hi>Set Forms,</hi> ſhould
now be content the Prieſts ſhould Indite
for you. The nature of Thanks is an
unavoidable conſequence of being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
or obliged; they grow in the Heart,
and from thence ſhew themſelves either
in Looks, Speech, Writing, or Action:
No man was ever Thankful becauſe he
was bid to be ſo, but becauſe he had, or
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52156:135"/>
thought he had ſome Reaſon for it. If
then there is cauſe in this Caſe to pay ſuch
extravagant Acknowledgments, they will
flow naturally, without taking ſuch pains
to procure them; and it is unkindly done
to Tire all the Poſt-Horſes with carrying
Circular Letters to ſolicite that which would
be done without any trouble or conſtraint:
If it is really in it ſelf ſuch a Favour, what
needeth ſo much preſſing men to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and with ſuch eager circumſtances,
that where Perſwaſions cannot delude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Threatnings are employed to fright them
into a Compliance. Thanks muſt be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantary,
not only unconſtrained, but
unſolicited, elſe they are either Trifles or
Snares, that either ſignifie nothing, or a
great deal more than is intended by
thoſe that give them. If an Inference
ſhould be made, That whoſoever thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the King for his Declaration, is by
that ingaged to Juſtifie it in point of
Law; it is a greater Stride than, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,
all thoſe care to make who are
perſwaded to Addreſs: If it ſhall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that all the Thankers will be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealers
of the TEST, whenever a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
ſhall meet. Such an Expectation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52156:136"/>
is better prevented before, then diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
afterwards; and the ſureſt way
to avoid the lying under ſuch a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,
is not to do any thing that may
give a colour to the Miſtake: Theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken
Thanks are little leſs improper
than Love Letters that were ſolicited by
the Lady to whom they are to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected:
ſo, that beſides the little ground
there is to give them, the manner of
getting them doth extreamly leſſen their
Value. It might be wiſhed that you
would have ſuppreſſed your impatience,
and have been content for the ſake of
Religion, to enjoy it within your ſelves
without the Liberty of a publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
till a Parliament had allowed it;
but ſince that could not be, and that
the Artifices of ſome amongſt you have
made uſe of the Well-meant Zeal of
the generality to draw them into this
Miſtake; I am ſo far from blaming you
with that ſharpneſs which perhaps, the
Matter in ſtrictneſs would bear, that I
am ready to err on the ſide of the more
gentle conſtruction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52156:136"/>
There is a great difference between
enjoying quietly the Advantages of an
Act irregularly done by others, and
the going about to ſupport it againſt
the Laws in being: the Law is ſo
Sacred, that no Treſpaſs againſt it is
to be defended; yet Frailties may in
ſome meaſure be excuſed, when they
cannot be juſtified. The Deſire of
enjoying a Liberty from which Men
have been ſo long reſtrained, may
be a Temptation that their Reaſon is
not at all times able to reſiſt. It in
ſuch a caſe, ſome Objections are leapt
over, indifferent Men will be more
inclined to lament the Occaſion, than
to fall too hard upon the Fault,
whilſt it is covered with the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of a good Intention; but where
to reſcue your ſelves from the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of one Law, you give a Blow
to all the Laws, by which your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Liberty are to be prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;
and inſtead of ſilently receiving
the Benefit of this Indulgence, you
ſet up for Advocates to ſupport it,
you become voluntary Aggreſſors, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52156:137"/>
look like Counſel retained by the
Prerogative againſt your old Friend
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> who hath done nothing
to deſerve her falling thus under your
Diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>If the Caſe then ſhould be, that the
Price expected from you for this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
is giving up your Right in the
Laws, ſure you will think twice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you go any further in ſuch a
loſing Bargain. After giving Thanks
for the Breach of one Law, you loſe
the Right of Complaining of the
Breach of all the reſt; you will not
very well know how to defend your
ſelves when you are preſſed; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given up the Queſtion when it
was for your Advantage, you cannot
re-call it when it ſhall be to your
Prejudice. If you will ſet up at one
time a Power to help you, which at
another time, by parity of Reaſon,
ſhall be made uſe of to deſtroy you,
you will neither be pitied, nor relieved
againſt a Miſchief you draw upon
your ſelves, by being ſo unreaſonably
thankful. It is like calling in Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52156:137"/>
to help, who are ſtrong enough
to ſubdue you: In ſuch a caſe your
Complaints will come too late to be
heard, and your Sufferings will raiſe
Mirth inſtead of Compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>If you think, for your Excuſe, to
expound your Thanks, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
them to this particular Caſe,
others, for their Ends, will extend
them further: And in theſe differing
Interpretations, that which is back'd by
Authority will be the moſt likely to
prevail; eſpecially when by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
you have given them, they
have in truth the better of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and that the Inferences from
your own Conceſſions are very ſtrong,
and expreſs againſt you. This is ſo
far from being a groundleſs Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that there was a late Inſtance of
it, the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, in
the Houſe of Lords, where the firſt
Thanks, though things of courſe,
were interpreted to be the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kings whole Speech, and
a Reſtraint from the further Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any part of it, though never ſo
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52156:138"/>
much diſliked; and it was with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
obtained, not to be excluded from
the liberty of objecting to this mighty
Prerogative of Diſpenſing, meerly by
this innocent and uſual piece of good
Manners, by which no ſuch thing could
poſſibly be intended.</p>
                  <p>This ſheweth, that ſome Bounds are
to be put to your good Breeding,
and that the Conſtitution of <hi>England</hi> is
too valuable a thing to be ventured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Complement. Now that you
have for ſome time enjoyed the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of the End, it is time for you to
look into the Danger of the Means:
The ſame Reaſon that made you deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to get Liberty, muſt make your ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
to preſerve it; ſo that the next
Thought will naturally be not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
your ſelf beyond Retreat, and to
agree ſo far with the Principles of all
Religion, as not to rely upon a Death-Bed
Repentance.</p>
                  <p>There are certain Periods of Time,
which being once paſt, make all Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ineffectual, and all Remedies deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52156:138"/>
Our Underſtandings are apt to
be hurried on by the firſt Heats,
which, if not reſtrained in time, do
not give us leave to look back, till it
is too late. Conſider this in the Caſe
of your Anger againſt the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and take warning by their
Miſtake in the ſame kind, when after
the late King's Reſtauration, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
ſo long the bitter Taſte of your
rough Uſage to them in other times,
that it made them forget their Intereſt,
and ſacrifice it to their Revenge.</p>
                  <p>Either you will blame this Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in them, and for that reaſon not
follow it, or if you allow it, you have
no reaſon to be offended with them;
ſo that you muſt either diſmiſs your
Anger, or loſe your Excuſe; except
you ſhould argue more partially than
will be ſuppoſed of Men of your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
and Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>If you had now to do with thoſe
rigid Prelates, who made it a matter
of Conſcience to give you the leaſt
Indulgence, but kept you at an unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52156:139"/>
Diſtance, and even to your moſt
reaſonable Scruples continued ſtiff and
inexorable, the Argument might be
fairer on your ſide: but ſince the
common Danger hath ſo laid open
that Miſtake, that all the former
Haughtineſs towards you is for ever
extinguiſhed, and that it hath turned
the Spirit of Perſecution into a Spirit
of Peace, Charity, and Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
ſhall this happy Change only
affect the Church of <hi>England?</hi> And are
you ſo in love with Separation, as
not to be mov'd by this Example? It
ought to be followed, were there no
other Reſon than that it is Vertue;
but when beſides that, it is become
neceſſary to your Preſervation, it is
impoſſible to fail the having its Effect
upon you.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould be ſaid, that the Church
of <hi>England</hi> is never humble but when
ſhe is out of power, and therefore
loſeth the Right of being believed
when ſhe pretended to it: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> it would be an uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
Objection, and very much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timed;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52156:139"/>
an unſeaſonable Triumph, not
only ungenerous, but unſafe: So that
in theſe reſpects it cannot be urged,
without Scandal, even though it could
be ſaid with Truth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is
not ſo in Fact, and the Argument muſt
fall, being built upon a falſe Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for whatever may be told you
at this very Hour, and in the
Heat and Glare of your preſent Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine,
the Church of <hi>England</hi> can in
a Moment bring Clouds again; and
turn the Royal Thunder upon your
Heads, blow you off the Stage with
a Breath, if ſhe would give but a
Smile or a king Word; the leaſt
Glimpſe of her Compliance would
throw you back into the State or
Suffering, and draw upon you all the
Arrears of Severity, which have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crued
during the time of this Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to you, and yet the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> with all her Faults, will
not allow her ſelf to be reſcued by
ſuch unjuſtifiable means, but chuſeth to
bear the Weight of Power, rather than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e

                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52156:140"/>
It cannot be ſaid, that ſhe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provoked;
Books and Letters come
out every Day, to call for Anſwers,
yet ſhe will not be ſtirred. From the
ſuppoſed Authors, and the Stile, one
would ſwear they were Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
and had made a Contract to
fall out with the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
There are Laſhes in every Addreſs,
Challenges to draw the Pen in every
Pamphlet: In ſhort, the faireſt Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the World given to quarrel; but
ſhe wiſely diſtinguiſheth between the
Body of Diſſenters, whom ſhe will
ſuppoſe to act as they do, with no

pickt and ſent out to picqueer, and
to begin a Fray amongſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
for the Entertainment as well
as the Advantage of the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Conduct is ſo good, that it
will be ſcandalous not to applaud it.
It is not equal Dealing to blame our
Adverſaries for doing ill, and not
commend them when they do well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52156:140"/>
To hate them becauſe they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
and not to be reconciled to them
when they are ready to ſuffer, rather
than receive all the Advantages that
can be gained by a Criminal Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
is a Principle no ſort of Chriſtians
can own, ſince it would give an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to them never to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Think a little who they were that

and then conſider how it will look to

                  <p>Have you enough conſidered what
will be expected from you? Are you

and Repeal the <hi>Teſt,</hi> by which

be ſo comprehenſive as to include the
Papiſts in it?</p>
                  <p>Conſider, that the implyed Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of your new Treaty are no
leſs, than that you are to do every
thing you are deſired, without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and that for this pretended Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Conſcience, your real Freedom
is to be ſacrificed: Your former Faults
hang like Chains ſtill about you, you
are let looſe only upon Bayl; the firſt

Act of Non-compliance, ſendeth you

                  <p>You may ſee that the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
do not relie upon the Legality
of this Power, which you are to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie,
ſince the being ſo very earneſt to
get it eſtabliſhed by a Law, and the
doing ſuch very hard things in order,
as they think, to obtain it, is a clear
Evidence, that they do not think that
the ſingle Power of the Crown is in
this Caſe a good Foundation; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when this is done under a Prince,
ſo very tender of all the Rights of
Sovereignty, that he would think it a
Diminution to his Prerogative, where
he conceiveth it ſtrong enough to go
alone, to call in the Legiſlative help
to ſtrengthen and ſupport it.</p>
                  <p>You have formerly blamed the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> and not without reaſon,
for going ſo far as they did in their
Compliance; and yet as ſoon as they
ſtopped, you ſee they are not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,

from this Example, that you muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

break off your Friendſhip, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to have no Bounds in it. If they
do not ſucceed in their Deſign, they
will leave you firſt; if they do, you
muſt either leave them, when it will
be too late for your Safety, or elſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſqueazineſs of ſtarting at a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice,
you muſt be forced to ſwallow
Tranſubſtantiation:</p>
                  <p>Remember that the other day thoſe
of the <hi>Church of England</hi> were <hi>Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
for enduring you, and now by a

do not deceive your ſelves,
it is not the nature of laſting Plants
thus to ſhoot up in a Night; you may
look gay and green for a little time,
but you want a Root to give you a
Continuance. It is not ſo long ſince,
as to be forgotten, that the <hi>Maxim</hi>
was, <hi>It is impoſſible for a Diſſenter not to
be a REBEL.</hi> Conſider at this time in

What are you to expect then from your

                  <p>Beſides all this, you Act very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfully

of your good Star, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth
you every thing that is proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church of England</hi> convinced of
its Error in being ſevere to you; the
<hi>Parliament,</hi> when-ever it meeteth, ſure
to be gentle to you; the next Heir
bred in the Country which you have
ſo often quoted for a Pattern of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence;
a general Agreement of all
thinking Men, that we muſt no more
cut our ſelves off from the Proteſtants
abroad, but rather inlarge the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52156:143"/>
upon which we are to build our
Defences againſt the Common Enemy;
ſo that in truth, all things ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
to give you Eaſe and Satisfaction,
if by too much haſte to anticipate
your good Fortune, you do not deſtroy
it.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants have but one Article
of Humane Strength, to oppoſe the
Power which is now againſt them, and
that is, not to loſe the advantage of
their Numbers, by being ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary
as to let themſelves be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>We all agree in our Duty to our
Prince; our Objections to his Belief do
not hinder us from ſeeing his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
and our not complying with his
Religion, hath no effect upon our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance;
we are not to be laughed out
of our Paſſive-Obedience, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Non-Reſiſtance; though even
thoſe who perhaps owe the beſt part of
their Security to that Principle, are apt to
make a Jeſt of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:52156:143"/>
                     <hi>So that if we give no advantage by
the fatal Miſtake of miſapplying our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
by the natural courſe of things,
this Danger will paſs away like a ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Hail; fair weather will ſucceed,
as lowering as the Sky now looketh,
and all this by plain and eaſie Receipt;</hi>
Let us be ſtill, quiet, and undivided,
firm at the ſame time to our Religion, our
Loyalty, and our Laws; and ſo long as we
continue this method, it is next to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
that the odds of 200 to one ſhould
loſe the Bett; except the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which hath been ſo long barren of Miracles,
ſhould now in her declining Age, be brought
to Bed of One that would out-do the beſt ſhe
can brag of in her <hi>Legend.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, the ſhort Queſtion will
be, Whether you will join with thoſe
who muſt in the end run the ſame Fate
with you? If Proteſtants of all ſorts, in
their Behaviour to one another, have
been to blame, they are upon the more
equal terms, and for that very reaſon
it is fitter for them now to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.
Our Diſ-union is not only
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52156:144"/>
a Reproach, but a Danger to us;
thoſe who believe in modern Miracles,
have more Right, or at leaſt more
Excuſe, to neglect all Secular Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but for us, it is as juſtifiable
to have no Religion, as wilfully to
throw away the Humane Means of
preſerving it. I am,</p>

                  <head>Some Cautions offered to the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of thoſe who are to chuſe
Members to ſerve for the Enſuing
Parliament.</head>
                  <p>I Will make no other introduction, than
that it is hoped the Counties and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs
will remember in general, That
beſides other Conſequences, they will have
the Credit of a good Choice, or the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
that belongeth to an ill one.</p>
                  <p>The Creators will be thought like their
Creatures; and therefore an ill Choice will
either be a diſparagement of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
or their Morals.</p>
                  <p>There cannot be a fuller Approbation of a
thing, than the Chuſing of it; ſo that the
fault of the Members choſen, if known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
will be judged to be of the
growth of that County or Borough, after
ſuch a ſolemn Approbation of them.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, thoſe who ſend up their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives
to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> ſhould take care
they may be ſuch as will do them Right, and
their Countrey Honour.</p>
                  <p>Now to the particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:52156:146"/>
I. A very extraordinary earneſtneſs to be
choſen, is no very good Symptom: A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to ſerve the Nation in Parliament, is
an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man's Ambition: Always to be
Encouraged, and never to be diſapproved.</p>
                  <p>A Man may not only be willing to ſtand,
but he may declare that willingneſs to his
Friends, that they may aſſiſt him, and by
all the means becoming a modeſt and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Man, he may endeavour to ſucceed,
and prevent the being diſappointed in it.</p>
                  <p>But there is a wide difference between
this and the raiſing a king of petty War
in the County or Corporation; entring the
Liſts rather for a Combat than an Election;
throwing Fire-balls to put Men into heat,
and omitting to ſpread no Reports, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
true or falſe, which may give an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
by laying a Blemiſh upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Methods will ever be ſuſpicious;
it will never be thought a Natural thing
for Men to take ſuch extravagant pains for
the meer ſake of doing good to others.</p>
                  <p>To be content to ſuffer ſomething for a
good end, is that which many would do
without any great repugnance: but where
a Man can honeſtly propoſe nothing to
himſelf, except Troubles, Charge, and Loſs,
by abſence from his own Affairs, to be ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52156:146"/>
violent in the purſuit of ſo ill a Bargain, is
not at all ſuited to the languiſhing Virtue of
Mankind ſo corrupted.</p>
                  <p>Such a ſelf-denying Zeal in ſuch a ſelf-ſeeking
Age, is ſo little to be imagin'd, that
it may without injury be ſuſpected.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when theſe bluſtring Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
come upon the Stage, their natural
Temper and other Circumſtances ought to
be very well conſider'd, before Men truſt
them with the diſpoſal of their Money, or
their Liberty.</p>
                  <p>And I am apt to believe, there could
hardly be found one ſingle Man whoſe other
Qualifications would over-balance the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
that lie againſt ſuch importunate
Suitors.</p>
                  <p>II. Recommending Letters ought to have
no effect upon Elections.</p>
                  <p>In this I muſt diſtinguiſh; for tho in
ſtrictneſs perhaps there ſhould be no Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
yet in compliance with long practice,
and out of an Indulgence that is neceſſary
in a time when Mankind is too much looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from ſevere Rules, to be kept cloſe up to
them, Letters ſent only from Equal Men,
doing Good Men right by giving Evidence
in their behalf, offering them as fitly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
when they really are ſo, and freeing
them from unjuſt Aſperſions, may be ſtill al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52156:147"/>
The Letters I mean, are from Men of
Power, where it may be beneficial to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and inconvenient to oppoſe.</p>
                  <p>Choice muſt not only be free from Force,
but from Influence, which is a degree of
Force: There muſt be no difficulty, no
apprehenſion that a Refuſal will be ill taken,
or reſented.</p>
                  <p>The Freeholders muſt be Freemen too;
they are to have no Shackles upon their
Votes in a Election: and the Men who
ſtand, ſhould carry their own Letters of
Recommendation about them, which are
there good Character and Behaviour in the
World, without borrowing Evidence, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when it comes from ſuſpected hands.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who make uſe of theſe Epiſtles,
ought to have no more advantage from
them, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have from the
Letters put into their hands, when they are
buried, to recommend them to St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt ſhould as little get admittance.
for Men into the Parliament, as theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
can introduce the Bearers into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The Scandal of ſuch Letters lieth firſt
in the arrogant impoſing of thoſe that write
them, and next in the wretched Meanneſs
of thoſe that need them.</p>
                  <p>Men muſt be fallen very low in their
Credit, who upon ſuch an occaſion have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52156:147"/>
a recourſe to Power to ſupport it: Their
Enemies could not give ſtronger Evidence
of their not being fit for that which they
pretend to. And if the Electors judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
they will be pretty ſure in a little time
to ſee their Miſtake, and to repent it.</p>
                  <p>III. Non-Attendance in former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ought to be a Bar againſt the Choice
of Men who have been guilty of it.</p>
                  <p>It is one of the worſt kinds of Non-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence,
and the leaſt to be excuſed: It is
very hard that Men ſhould deſpiſe a Duty,
which perhaps is the only ground of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
that is paid to them.</p>
                  <p>It is ſuch a piece of Sawcineſs for any one
to preſs for the Honour of ſerving in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and then to be careleſs in Attending
it, that in a Houſe where there were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Officers, the Penalty had not been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
to have Caſhier'd them for not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
at the General Muſter.</p>
                  <p>If men forbear to come out of Lazineſs,
let them be gratified by taking their eaſe
at Home without interruption; If out of
ſmall Cunning to avoid Difficulties, and to
eſcape from the Inconvenience of Voting in
Critical Caſes, let them enjoy that deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pitch of Wiſdom, and never pretend to
make a Figure where the Publick is to be
ſerved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52156:148"/>
If it would not be thought adviſable to
truſt a Man immediately after he hath
been drawn out of a Gaol, it may be as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to look upon one who for his Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attendance
in the Houſe hath been ſent for
in Cuſtody, as a king of Bankrupt, which
putteth him upon unequal terms with thoſe
who have been aſſiduous in the diſcharge
of their Duty.</p>
                  <p>They who thought fit in one Seſſion to
neglect the Publick Buſineſs, may be juſtly
ſuſpected, by their ſtanding, in the next to
intend their own.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe more deliberate Offenders,
there are ſome who do not Attend even
when they are in the Houſe: abſent in their
Thoughts for want of Comprehending the
Buſineſs that is doing, and therefore divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from it by any thing that is Trivial.</p>
                  <p>Such Men are Nuſances to a ſerious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly;
and when they are Numerous, it
amounteth almoſt to a Diſſolution; it being
ſcarce poſſible for good ſence to be heard,
whilſt a noiſe is made by the buzzing of
theſe Horſe flies.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Cenſors who degraded a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator
for yawning whilſt there was a Debate,
would have much more abundant matter
here upon which they might exerciſe their
Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52156:148"/>
To conclude this Head, There are ſo few
that ever mended in theſe Caſes, that after
the firſt Experiment it is not at all reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to take them upon a new Tryal.</p>
                  <p>IV. Men who are unquiet and buſy in
their Natures, are to give more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
proofs of their Integrity, before the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
them into a Publick Truſt can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
As a hot Summer breedeth greater
ſwarms of Flies, ſo an active time breedeth a
greater number of theſe ſhining Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>It is pretty ſure, That men who cannot
allow themſelves to be at reſt, will let no
body elſe be at quiet. Such a perpetual
Activity is apt by degrees to be applied to
the purſuit of their private intereſt. And
their thoughts being in a continual motion,
they have not time to dwell long enough
upon any thing to entertain a ſcruple.</p>
                  <p>So that they are generally at full liberty
to do what is moſt convenient for them,
without being fettered by any Reſtraints.</p>
                  <p>Nay further; Whenever it hapneth that
there is an Impunity for Cheating, theſe nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Gentlemen are apt to think it a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their Underſtandings not to go into it.</p>
                  <p>I doubt it is not a wrong to the preſent
Age, to ſay, that a Knave is a leſs unpopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Calling than it hath been in former
times. And to ſay truth, it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52156:149"/>
in ſome Men to turn Honeſt,
when they owe all they have to their Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                  <p>The People are in this reſpect unhappy;
they are too many to do their own buſineſs;
their numbers, which make their ſtrength,
are at the ſame time the cauſe of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
they are too unweildy to move; and
for this Reaſon nothing can ever redeem
them from this incurable Impotency: So
that they muſt have Solicitors to purſue
and look after their Intereſts: who are too
often diſpoſed to diſpenſe with the Fidelity
they owe to thoſe that truſt them; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if the Government will pay their Bills
without Abatement.</p>
                  <p>It is better theſe Gentlement's dexterity
ſhould be employed any where than in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
where the ill conſequence of their
being Members is too much diffuſed, and
not reſtrained to the County or Borough
who ſhall be ſo unwary as to Chuſe them.</p>
                  <p>V. Great Drinkers are leſs fit to Serve in
Parliament than is apprehended.</p>
                  <p>Men's Virtue, as well as their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is apt to be tainted by it.</p>
                  <p>The appearance of it is Sociable and well-natur'd,
but it is by no means to be rely'd
upon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:52156:149"/>
Nothing is more frail than a Man too far
engaged in wet Popularity.</p>
                  <p>The habit of it maketh Men careleſs of
their buſineſs, and that naturally leadeth
them into Circumſtances, that make them
liable to Temptation.</p>
                  <p>It is ſeldom ſeen, That any Principles
have ſuch a root, as that they can be proof
againſt the continual droppings of a Bottle.</p>
                  <p>As to the Faculties of the Mind, there
is not leſs Objection; the vapours of Wine
may ſometimes throw out ſparks of Wit,
but they are like ſcattered pieces of Ore,
there is no Vein to work upon.</p>
                  <p>Such Wit, even the beſt of it, is like
paying great Fines; in which caſe there
muſt of neceſſity be an abatement of the
conſtant Rent.</p>
                  <p>Nothing ſure is a greater Enemy to the
Brain, than too much moiſture; it can the
leaſt of any thing bear the being continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſteeped: And it may be ſaid, that
Thought may be reſembled to ſome Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
which can live only in a dry Country.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſo arrogant are ſome men, as to
think they are ſo much Maſters of Buſineſs,
as that they can play with it; they imagine
they can drown their Reaſon once a day, and
that it ſhall not be the worſe for it; forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that by too often diving the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52156:150"/>
at laſt groweth too weak to riſe up
again.</p>
                  <p>I will ſuppoſe this fault was leſs frequent
when <hi>Solon</hi> made it one of his Laws, That
it was Lawful to Kill a Magiſtrate if he
was found D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>unk. Such a Liberty taken
in this Age, either in the Parliament or
out of it, would do terrible Execution.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but mention a Petition in the
year 1647, from the County of <hi>Devon,</hi>
to the Houſe of Commons, againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
Election of Burgeſſes, who are ſtrong
in Wine and weak in Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of ſuch Petitions is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by Chuſing ſuch as ſhall not give
handle for them.</p>
                  <p>VI. Wanting-Men give ſuch cauſe of
ſuſpicion where ever they deal, that ſurely
the Chuſers will be upon their guard, as
often as ſuch dangerous pretenders make
their application to them.</p>
                  <p>Let the behaviour of ſuch Men be never
ſo plauſible and untainted, yet they who
are to pitch upon thoſe they are to truſt
with all they have, may be excuſed, if they
do not only conſider what they are but
what they may be.</p>
                  <p>As we Pray our ſelves we may not be
led, into Temptation, we ought not by
any means to thruſt others into it; even
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52156:150"/>
though our own Intereſt was not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
And ſure when it is, the Argument
hath not leſs force.</p>
                  <p>If a Man hath a ſmall Eſtate, and a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Family; where it happeneth that
a Man hath as many Children as he hath
Tenants, It is not a Recommending Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
for his Election.</p>
                  <p>When it cometh to be the Queſtion with
ſuch a Man, Whether he ſhall be Juſt to
the Publick, or Cruel to his Family? It is
very poſſible the deciſion may be on the
ſide of Corrupted Nature.</p>
                  <p>It is a Complement to this Age, which
it doth not deſerve, to ſuppoſe Men are ſo
ty'd up to Morality, as that they cannot
be pinched out of it: eſpecially now when
it is called Starving not to be Embroidered,
or ſerved in Plate.</p>
                  <p>The Men Choſen to ſerve their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
ſhould not be loaden with Suits that
may tempt them to aſſume Privileges;
much leſs under ſuch Neceſſities as may
more immediately prepare them for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                  <p>Men who need a Parliament for their
own particular Intereſt, have more reaſon
to offer their Service than others have to
accept of it. And though I do not doubt,
but there may be ſome whoſe Virtue would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52156:151"/>
triumph over their Wants, let them be
never ſo preſſing; yet to expoſe the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
to the hazard of being deceived, is
that which can never be juſtifi'd by thoſe
that Chuſe. And tho it muſt be allow'd
poſſible for a wanting-Man to be honeſt,
yet it is impoſſible for a Man to be wiſe
that will depend upon it.</p>
                  <p>VII. There is a ſort of Men that have
a Tinſel-wit, which make them ſhine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
thoſe who cannot judge.</p>
                  <p>Club and Coffee-houſe Gentlemen, Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Merchants of ſmall Conceits, who have
an Empty habit of prating without mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
They always aim at Wit and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make falſe Fire.</p>
                  <p>Their buſineſs is leſs to learn, than to ſet
themſelves out; which makes them chuſe
to be with ſuch as can only be Witneſſes
of their ſmall Ingenuity, rather than with
ſuch as might improve it.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſubordinate Wit, as much
inferior to a Wit of buſineſs, as a Fidler
at a Wake is to the lofty Sound of an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</p>
                  <p>Men of this Size are in no degree ſuited
to the buſineſs of redreſſing Grievances,
and making Laws.</p>
                  <p>There is a Parliament Wit to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd
from all other kinds; thoſe who
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52156:151"/>
have it, do not ſtuff their heads only with
Cavils and Objections.</p>
                  <p>They have a deliberate and an obſerving
Wit, a Head turned to Publick things;
Men who place a greater pleaſure in mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Fault than in finding it out.</p>
                  <p>Their Underſtanding directeth them to
object in the right place, and not like thoſe
who go by no other Rule, than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That muſt be the beſt Counſel which
was not taken.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Whole-ſale Judges ſhew ſuch a
groſs and peeviſh Ignorance, that it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ſo openly in all they ſay or do, That
they give loud warning to all conſidering
Men, not to chuſe them.</p>
                  <p>VIII. The diſlike of ſlight Airy Men
muſt not go ſo far, as to recommend heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in oppoſition to it, eſpecially where
men are convicted of it by Experience in
former Seſſions.</p>
                  <p>As a lively Coxcomb will ſeldom fail
to lay in his claim for Wit; ſo a Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
is apt to pretend, That his heavineſs is
a proof of his Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Some have an univerſal Lethargy ſpread

thoughts to publick Buſineſs, as to give the
attention that is neceſſary to Comprehend
it.</p>
                  <p>There are thoſe who have ſuch a thick
Shell upon their Brains, that their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is impenetrable, and maketh ſuch aſtout
reſiſtance againſt Common Senſe,
that it will never be ſubdued by it: True
Heart of Oak, Ignorance that will never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yield,
let Reaſon beat never ſo hard upon
it; and though their kind Neighbours have
at ſeveral Elections ſent them up to School
again, they have ſtill return'd the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
Dunces.</p>
                  <p>There is a falſe Gravity that is a very
ill ſymptom; and it may be ſaid, That as
Rivers, which run very ſlowly, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the moſt Mud at the bottom; ſo a
ſolid ſtiffneſs in the conſtant courſe of a
man's Life, is a ſign of a thick bed of Mud
at the bottom of his Brain.</p>
                  <p>A dull man is ſo near a dead Man, that
he is hardly to be ranked in the Liſt of the
Living; and as he is not to be buri'd whilſt
he is half alive, ſo he is as little to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
whilſt: he is half dead.</p>
                  <p>Parliaments are now grown to be quite
other things than they were formerly.</p>
                  <p>In Ancient Times they were little more
than Great Aſſizes; A Roll of Grievances;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52156:152"/>
                     <hi>Magna Charta</hi> confirmed; Privileges of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Church preſerved; ſo many Sacks of
Wool given, and away.</p>
                  <p>Now there are Traps and Gins laid for
the well-meaning Country-Gentleman; he
is to grapple with the Cunning of Men in
Town, which is not a little improv'd by
being rewarded and encourag'd.</p>
                  <p>So that men whoſe good Intentions are
not ſeconded and ſupported by ſome degree
of Ability, are as much the more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as they are leſs criminal than Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Knaves. Their honeſt Miſtakes, for
want of diſtinguiſhing, either give a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
to, or at leaſt leſſen the Scandal
of the injurious things that are done to the
Publick: and with leave ask'd for ſo odd
an expreſſion, Their Innocent Guilt is as
miſchievous to the Laws and Liberties, as
the moſt deliberate Malice of thoſe that
would deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>IX. There is an Abuſe which daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth,
of ſending ſuch to Parliament, as
are ſcarce old enough to be ſent to the
Univerſity.</p>
                  <p>I would not in this reſtrain the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of theſe Boys to the Age of Twenty
One: If my Opinion might take place,
I ſhould wiſh that none might be choſen
into the Houſe of Commons under Thirty;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52156:153"/>
and to make ſome Equality, I ſhould from
the ſame Motives, think it convenient,
That no Lord ſhould have a Vote in Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature
under that Age.</p>
                  <p>But to leave this Digreſſion; I cannot ſee
why the Chuſers ſhould not at leaſt make it
a Rule among themſelves, Not to ſend any
Man to Repreſent them under the Age of
Twenty five, which is the time of Majority
in moſt other places of the world.</p>
                  <p>Surely it is not that we are Earlier plants
than our Neighbours.</p>
                  <p>Such ſuppoſition could neither be juſtifi'd
by our Climate, nor by the degree of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in which we are placed; I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
attribute it to the haſte our Anceſtors
had (and not without reaſon) to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from the Severity of Wardſhips.</p>
                  <p>But whether this, or any thing elſe,
was the cauſe of our earlier ſtepping into
Man's Eſtate; ſo it is now, that according
to our Laws, Twenty one is the Age of
Diſcretion; and the Young Man is then
veſted with a Legal, how defective ſoever
he may be in his Natural Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>With all this, there ought to be a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
made between coming out of Pupilage,
and leaping into Legiſlatorſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52156:153"/>
It is perhaps inconvenient enough that
a man ſhould be ſo ſoon let looſe to deſtroy
his own Eſtate; but it is yet worſe, that he
ſhould then have a Power of giving away
other men's.</p>
                  <p>The Law muſt make General Rules, to
which there always will be ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
                  <p>If there were Tryers appointed to judge
when Leading-Strings ſhould be left off,
many would wear them a very great while,
and ſome perhaps with their Gray Hairs;
there being no ſmall number of Old Boys
in all times and eſpecially in this.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary therefore to make Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to this General Rule, where the Caſe
ſo much requireth it, as it doth in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The ground of ſending theſe <hi>Minors</hi> to
Parliament ought not to recommend the
Continuance of it to thoſe who are Lovers
of Liberty; ſince it was by the Authority
and Influence of Great Men, that their
Stripling Sons were firſt receiv'd by the
humble depending Boroughs, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
Counties.</p>
                  <p>They called it, as many do ſtill, the
beſt School for Young Men. Now Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
hath ſhew'd us, that it is like a
School only in this reſpect, That theſe Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52156:154"/>
when they are admitted, deſerve to be
whipp'd in it.</p>
                  <p>If the Houſe of Commons is a School, it
muſt be for Men of riper Age; theſe are
too young to learn there, and being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by a miſtaken ſmattering in ſmall Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,
they grow too ſupercilious to learn
any where elſe; ſo that inſtead of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
young promiſing Plants, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
by being miſplac'd.</p>
                  <p>If then they do themſelves hurt by it, it
is ſurer yet that they do the Houſe no good
by coming into it.</p>
                  <p>They were not Green Geeſe that are ſaid
to have ſav'd the Capitol; they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
of full Age, or elſe their Cackling could
not have been heard, ſo as to give warning.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it look'd of late, when the Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was to have long continu'd Parliaments,
as if we might plant a Boy in the Houſe
with a Proſpect that he might continue
there till he had Gray Hairs: And that the
ſame Sapling might have ſuch a Root, as
that he might grow up to be Timber with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being remov'd.</p>
                  <p>If theſe Young Men had skill enough to
pitch upon ſome Body in the Houſe, to
whom they might reſign their Opinion, and
upon whoſe Judgment they might lean with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reſerve, there might be leſs Objection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52156:154"/>
But to ſpeak Truth, they know as little
how to chuſe, as thoſe did who Elected
them: ſo that there is no other Expedient
left, than the letting them alone.</p>
                  <p>One may ſay, generally ſpeaking, That
a young Man being too ſoon qualifi'd for the
ſerious Buſineſs of Parliaments, would really
be no good Symptom.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſign of too much Phlegm, and too
little Fire in the beginning of Age, if Men
have not a little more heat than is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient;
for as they grow older they will run
a hazard of not having ſo much as is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
                  <p>The Truth is, The vigour of Youth is
ſoften'd and miſapply'd, when it is not ſpent
either in War or cloſe Studies; all other
Courſes have an idle Mixture that cometh
to nothing, and maketh them like Trees,
which for want of Pruning run up to
Wood, and ſeldom or never bear any Fruit.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Head, it muſt be own'd,
That there is no Age of our Life which doth
not carry Arguments along with it to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us: and therefore it would be well for
the Buſineſs of the World, if young Men
would ſtay longer before they went into it,
and old Men not ſo long before they went
out of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52156:155"/>
X. Next to theſe may be rank'd a ſort
of ſuperfine Gentlemen, Carpet-Knights,
Men whoſe Heads may be ſaid to be only
Appurtenances to their Perukes, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
ingroſs all their Care and Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>There Underſtanding is ſo ſtrictly appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to their Dreſs; that no part of it is
upon pain of their utmoſt Diſpleaſure to be
diverted to any other uſe.</p>
                  <p>It is not by this intended to recommend
an affected Clown, or to make it a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Qualification for a Member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he muſt renounce clean Linen
or good Manners; but ſurely a too earneſt
Application to make every thing ſit Right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, ſtriketh too deep into their ſmall
ſtock of Thoughts to allow it Furniture for
any thing elſe.</p>
                  <p>To do Right to theſe fine-ſpun Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
Buſineſs is too courſe a thing for them,
which maketh it an unreaſonable Hardſhip
upon them to oppreſs them with it; ſo that
in tenderneſs to them, no leſs than out of
care to the Publick, it is beſt to leave them
to their Taylors with whom they will live
in much better Correſpondence, when the
Danger is prevented of their falling out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Privileges.</p>

XI. Men of Injuſtice and Violence, in
their private Dealings, are not to be truſted
by the People with a Commiſſion to treat
for them in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. The King Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
in his Writs not to chuſe any
Knights who had been Guilty of Crime, or
Maintenance.</p>
                  <p>Theſe warm Men ſeldom fail to run into
Maintenance, taken in a larger Extent.</p>
                  <p>It is an unnatural Sound to come from a
Man that is arbitrary in his Neighbourhood,
to talk of Laws and Liberties at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter;</hi>
he is not a proper Vehicle for ſuch
Words, which ought never to be prophaned.</p>
                  <p>An habitual Breaker of the Laws, to be
made one of the Law-makers, is as if the
Benches in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall</hi> ſhould be filled
with Men out of <hi>Newgate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe who are of this Temper cannot
change their Nature out of reſpect to their
Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Quite contrary; they will leſs ſcruple to
do Wrong to a Nation where no Body ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
it to himſelf, than to particular Men
to whoſe Reſentments they are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
expoſed.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort they lie under ſuch ſtrong
Objections, that the over-balance of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Men cannot altogether purify an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52156:156"/>
where theſe unclean Beaſts are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>XII. Exceſſive Spenders and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Savers are to be Excluded, being both
greedy from differing Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>They are both of them Diſeaſes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and for that Reaſon are not to be
admitted into Publick Aſſemblies.</p>
                  <p>A prodigal Man muſt be, greedy becauſe
he thinketh he can never ſpend enough.</p>
                  <p>The Wretch muſt be ſo, becauſe he will
never think he can hoard enough.</p>
                  <p>The World firſt admireth Men's Wiſdom
for getting Money, and then raileth at them
if they do not throw it away? ſo that the
Prodigal Man is only the leſs unpopular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme;
he is every jot as well prepared as
the Miſer to fall out with his Morals, when
once a good Temptation is offered him to
lay them aſide.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, ſome Rich Men are as
eager to overtake thoſe that are Richer, as
a Running horſe is to get to the Race-poſt,
before the other that contendeth with him.</p>
                  <p>Men often deſire to heap, rather becauſe
others have more, than that they know
what to do with that which they covet
with ſo much Impatience.</p>
                  <p>So that it is plain, the Fancy hath as great
a ſhare in this imaginary Pleaſure of Gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52156:156"/>
as it hath in Love, Ambition, or any
other Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is pretty ſure, that as no Man was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Richer for having a good Eſtate, if
he did not look after it; ſo neither will he
be the Honeſter if he hath never ſo much.</p>
                  <p>Want of care will always create want of
Money; ſo that whether a Man is a begger
becauſe he never had any Money, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he can never keep any, it is all one
to thoſe who are to truſt him.</p>
                  <p>Upon this head of Prodigality, it may
be no unreaſonable Caution to be afraid of
thoſe who in former Service have, been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly
Liberal of the Publick Money.</p>
                  <p>Truſting is ſo hazardous a thing, that it
ſhould never be done but where it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
ſo that when Truſtees are found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Tryal to be very Laviſh, even without
examining into the Cauſes of it, (which are
generally very ſuſpicious) it is a reaſonable
part of preventing Wit to change Hands, or
elſe the Chuſers will pay the Penalty that
belongeth to good Nature ſo miſplaced, and
the Conſequences will be attended with the
Aggravation of their not being made Wiſer
by ſuch a ſevere and coſtly warning.</p>
                  <p>XIII. It would be of very great uſe to
take a general Reſolution throughout the
Kingdom, That none ſhould be choſen for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52156:157"/>
a County but ſuch as have either in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or Reverſion, a conſiderable Eſtate
in it; nor for a Burrough, except he be
Reſiant, or that he hath ſome Eſtate in the
County, in preſent or Expectancy.</p>
                  <p>There have been Eminent Men of Law
who were of opinion, That in the Caſe of
a Burgeſs of a Town not Reſiant, the Court
is to give Judgment according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
notwithſtanding Cuſtom to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                  <p>But not to inſiſt now upon that, the
prudential part is Argument enough to ſet
up a Rule to abrogate an ill Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>There is not, perhaps, a greater Cauſe
of the Corruption of Parliaments, than by
adopting Members, who may be ſaid to
have no title by their Births.</p>
                  <p>The Juries are by the Law to be <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicineto;</hi>
And ſhall there be leſs care that
the Repreſentatives of the People be ſo
too?</p>
                  <p>Sure the Intereſt of the County is beſt
placed in the hands of ſuch as have ſome
ſhare in it.</p>
                  <p>The Outliers are not ſo eaſily kept with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the pale of the Laws.</p>
                  <p>They are often choſen without being
known, which is more like chuſing Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
than Members of Parliament. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52156:157"/>
of their ſtanding is more juſtly to
be ſuppoſed, that they may redreſs their
own Grievances which they know, than
thoſe of the Countrey, to which they are
ſtrangers.</p>
                  <p>They are choſen at <hi>London</hi> to ſerve in
<hi>Cornwall,</hi> &amp;c. and are often Parties, before
they come to be Repreſentatives: One
would think the Reproach it is for a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
not to have Men within their own Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
to ſerve them in Parliament, ſhould be
Argument enough to reject theſe Treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,
without urging the ill Conſequences
in other Reſpects of their being admitted.</p>
                  <p>XIV. As in ſome Caſes it is adviſable
to give a total excluſion to Men not fitly
qualified; ſo in others it is more proper to
lay down a general Rule of Caution, with
allowance of ſome Exceptions, where Men
have given ſuch proofs of themſelves, as
create a Right for them to be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Of this nature is that which I ſhall ſay
concerning Lawyers, who, by the ſame
Reaſon that they may be uſeful, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
very dangerous.</p>
                  <p>The Negligence, and want of Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Gentlemen, hath made them to be
thought more neceſſary than naturally they
are in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52156:158"/>
They have not only ingroſſed the Chair
of the Speaker, but that of a Committee is
hardly thought to be well filled, except it
be by a Man of the Robe.</p>
                  <p>This maketh it worthy of the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
reflection of all Gentlemen, that it
may be an Argument to them to quail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
themſelves in Parliamentary Learning,
in ſuch a manner, as that they may rely
upon their own Abilities, in order to the
ſerving their Countrey.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the point in queſtion;
It is not without Precedent, that Practiſing-Lawyers
have been excluded from ſerving
in Parliament; and, without following
thoſe Patterns ſtrictly, I cannot but think
it reaſonable, that whilſt a Parliament ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
no Member of Parliament ſhould
plead at any Bar.</p>
                  <p>The Reaſon of it is in many reſpects
ſtrong in it ſelf, and is grown much ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
by the long ſitting of Parliaments of
late; but I will not dwell upon this: The
matter now in queſtion being concerning
Lawyers being Elected, which I conceive
ſhould be done with ſo much circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection,
that probably it would not often
happen.</p>
                  <p>If Lawyers have great Practice, that
ought to take them up; if not, it is no
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52156:158"/>
great ſign of their Ability; and at the
ſame time giveth a ſuſpicion, that they may
be more liable to be tempted.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould be ſo in Fact, That no King
ever wanted Judges to ſoften the ſtiffneſs
of the Laws that were made, ſo as to make
them ſuit better with the Reaſon of State,
and the Convenience of the Government;
it is no Injury now to ſuppoſe it poſſible
for Lawyers in the Houſe of Commons, ſo
to behave themſelves in the making of
New Laws, as the better to make way for
the having their Robes lined with Fur.</p>
                  <p>They are Men uſed to argue on both
ſides of a Queſtion; And if ordinary Fees
can inſpire them with very good Reaſons
in a very ill Cauſe, that Faculty exerciſed
in Parliaments, where it may be better
encouraged, may prove very inconvenient
to thoſe that chuſe them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, without arraigning a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
that it would be ſcandalous for a man
not to honour; one may, by a Suſpicion,
which is the more excuſable when it is in
the behalf of the People, imagine that the
habit of taking Money for their Opinion,
may create in ſome ſuch a forgetfulneſs to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh,
that they may take it for their
Vote.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52156:159"/>
They are generally Men who by a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ſtudy hope to be advanced: They
have it in their Eye as a Reward for the
Toil they undergo.</p>
                  <p>This maketh them generally very ſlow,
and ill diſpoſed (let the Occaſion never
ſo much require it) to wreſtle with that Soil
where Preferment groweth.</p>
                  <p>Now if the Suppoſition be in its ſelf not
unreaſonable, and that it ſhould happen to
be ſtrengthen'd and confirm'd by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it will be very unneceſſary to ſay
any more upon this Article, but leave it to
the Electors to conſider of it.</p>
                  <p>XV. I cannot forbear to put in a Caveat
againſt Men ty'd to a Party.</p>
                  <p>There muſt in every body be a Leaning
to that ſort of Men who profeſs ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
more than to others who go upon
a different Foundation; but when a man
is drowned in a Party, plunged in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his depth, he runneth a great hazard
of being upon ill terms with good Senſe,
or Morality, if not with both of them.</p>
                  <p>Such a man can hardly be called a Free-Agent
and for that reaſon is very unfit
to be truſted with the Peoples Liberty, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he hath given up his own.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid, That in ſome part of the <hi>Indies</hi>
they do ſo affect little Feet, that they keep
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52156:159"/>
them ſqueezed while they are Children, ſo
that they ſtay at that ſmall ſize after they
are grown Men.</p>
                  <p>One may ſay ſomething like this of Men
lock'd up in a Party; They put their
Thoughts into ſuch a Narrow Mould, that
they can never be enlarged nor releaſed
from their firſt Confinements.</p>
                  <p>Men in a Party have <hi>Liberty</hi> only for
their <hi>Motto;</hi> in reality they are greater
Slaves than any body elſe would care to
make them.</p>
                  <p>A Party, even in times of Peace, (tho
againſt the Original Contract, and the
Bill of Rights) ſets up and continues the
exerciſe of Martial Law: Once inrolled,
the Man that quitteth, if they had their
will, would be hanged for a Deſerter.</p>
                  <p>They communicate Anger to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Contagion: And it may be ſaid,
that if too much Light dazzleth the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
too much Heat doth not leſs weaken
the Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Heat reigneth in the Fancy; and Reaſon,
which is a colder Faculty of the Brain, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
more time to be heard, than the other
will allow.</p>
                  <p>The Heat of a Party is like the Burning
of a Fever; and not a Natural Warmth,
evenly diſtributed to give Life and Vigor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:52156:160"/>
There was a time indeed when Anger
ſhew'd a good ſign of Honeſty; but that
Evidence is very much weakned by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
we have ſeen ſince the Days of
Yore: And the Publick ſpirited Choler hath
been thrown off within time of Memory,
and loſt almoſt all its Credit with ſome
People, ſince they found what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
thought fit to make their ſo doing
a ſtep to their preferment.</p>
                  <p>A ſtrong bluſtring Wind ſeldom conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
long in one Corner.</p>
                  <p>Some men knock loud only to be let in;
the Buſtle they make is animated by their
private Intereſt. The outward Blaze only
is for Religion and Liberty: The true laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fire, like that of the Veſtals which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
went out, is an eagerneſs to get ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
for themſelves.</p>
                  <p>A Houſe of Commons compoſed of ſuch
Men, would be more properly ſo many
Merchants incorporated in a Regular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
to make their particular Adventures,
than Men ſent from the People to ſerve
and repreſent them.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Splenetick Gentlemen
who confine their favourable Opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſo narrow a compaſs, that they will not
allow it to any man that was not hanged in
the late Reigns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52156:160"/>
Now by that rule one might expect they
ſhould reſcue themſelves from the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of being now alive; and by abdicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a World ſo little worthy of them, get
a great Name to themſelves, with the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
ſatisfaction of all thoſe they would
leave behind them.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the many other ill conſequences
of a ſtated Party, it is none of the leaſt,
that it tempteth low and inſignificant men
to come upon the Stage, to expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and to ſpoil Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>It turneth a Cypher into a Figure, ſuch
a one as it is: A man in a Party is able to
make a noiſe, let it be never ſo empty a
ſound.</p>
                  <p>A weak man is eaſily blown out of his
ſmall ſenſes, by being muſter'd into a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
he is flatter'd till he liketh himſelf ſo
well, that he taketh it extremely ill if he
hath not an Employment.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more in faſhion, than for men
to deſire good Places, and I doubt nothing
is leſs ſo than to deſerve them.</p>
                  <p>From Nobody to ſomebody is ſuch a
violent ſtride, that Nature, which hath the
Negative Voice, will not give its Royal
Aſſent to it: So that when inſufficient Men
aim at being in buſineſs, the worſt of their
Enemies might out of malice to them, pray
for their Preferment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:52156:161"/>
There could be no end, if one did not
ſtop till this Theme had no more matter
to furniſh. I will only ſay, Nothing is
more evident, than that the Good of the
Nation hath been ſacrificed to the Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
of the ſeveral Contending Parties; and
without entring into the diſpute which of
them are more or leſs in the right, it is
pretty ſure, that whilſt theſe Oppoſite Sets
of Angry Men are playing at Foot-ball,
they will break all the Windows, and do
more hurt than their pretended Zeal for
the Nation will ever make amends for.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, a man ſo engaged is retained
before the people take him for their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
he hath ſuch a Reverſe for his Party,
that it is not adviſeable for thoſe who
would chuſe him, to depend upon his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.
All Parties aſſuming ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing
Power, that by their Sovereign
Authority they cancel and diſſolve any Act
or Promiſe that they do not afterwards
approve.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſidered, thoſe who will
chuſe ſuch men deſerve whatever follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>XVI. Pretenders to Exorbitant Merit in
the late Revolution, are not without Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
againſt them, when they ſtand to
ſerve in Parliament. It would not only be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52156:161"/>
a low, but a Criminal kind of Envy, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a diſtinguiſhing Juſtice to Men who have
been inſtrumental and active, when the
Service of their Countrey requir'd it. But
there ought to be Moderation in men's
Claims, or elſe it is out of the Power of our
poor Iſland to ſatisfy them. It is true, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of all kinds is grown much dearer, like
Labourer's Wages, which formerly occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſeveral Statutes to regulate them.</p>
                  <p>But now the men who only carried Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
to the Building, when it is finiſhed,
think they are ill dealt with if they are not
made Maſter-Workmen.</p>
                  <p>They preſently cry out, The Original
Contract is broken, if their Merit is not
rewarded, at their own Rate too.</p>
                  <p>Some will think there never ought to be
an end of their Rewards; when indifferent
Judges would perhaps be puzzled to find
out the beginning of their Merit.</p>
                  <p>They bring in ſuch large Bills, that they
muſt be examin'd: Some bounds muſt be
put to men's Pretenſions; elſe the Nation,
which is to pay the Reckoning, will every
way think it a ſcurvy thing to be undone,
whether it be by being over-run by our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or by the being, exhauſted by our
Friends.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:52156:162"/>
There ought therefore to be deductions
where they are reaſonable, the better to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
the paying what remaineth.</p>
                  <p>For example, if any of theſe paſſionate
Lovers of the Proteſtant Religion ſhould
not think fit, in their manner of Living,
to give the leaſt evidence of their Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
their claims upon that Head might
ſure be ſtruck off without any Injuſtice
to them.</p>
                  <p>If there are any who ſet down great Sums
as a Reward due to their Zeal for reſcuing
Property from the Jaws of Arbitrary Power;
their pretenſions may fairly be rejected, if
now they are ſo far from ſhewing a care
and tenderneſs of the Laws, that they look
rather like Councel retained on the other
ſide.</p>
                  <p>It is no leſs ſtrange, than I doubt it is
true, that ſome Men ſhould be ſo in Love
with their dear Miſtreſs, <hi>Old England,</hi> with
all her Wrinkles, as out of an Heroick Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to Swim over to reſcue her from being
Raviſh'd; and when they have done the
Feat, the firſt thing after Enjoyment is, that
they go about to Strangle her.</p>
                  <p>For the ſake of true Love, it is not ſit
that ſuch ungentile Gallants ſhould be too
much encourag'd; and their Arrogance for
having done well at firſt, will have no right
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52156:162"/>
to be excuſed, if their ſo doing ill at laſt
doth not make them a little more modeſt.</p>
                  <p>True Merit, like a River, the deeper it
is the leſs noiſe it makes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe loud proclaimers of their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,
are not only to be ſuſpected for their
truth, but the Electors are to conſider that
ſuch meritorious Men lay an aſſeſſment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe that Chuſe them.</p>
                  <p>The Publick Taxes are already heavy
enough without the addition of theſe private
Reckonings. It is therefore the ſafer way
not to employ Men, who will expect more
for their Wages, than the miſtaken Borough
that ſendeth them up to Parliament could
be ſold for.</p>
                  <p>XVII. With all due regard to the nobleſt
of Callings, Military Officers are out of
their true Element when they are miſplaced
in a Houſe of Commons.</p>
                  <p>Things in this World ought to be well
ſuited. There are ſome Appearances ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
that men are convinc'd by them
without any other Argument.</p>
                  <p>The very Habit in ſome Caſes, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth
or giveth Offence.</p>
                  <p>If the Judges upon the Bench ſhould, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of their Furrs, which ſignifie Gravity,
and beſpeak Reſpect, be Cloathed like the
Jockeys at <hi>New-Market,</hi> or wear Jack-Boots
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52156:163"/>
and <hi>Steenkirks;</hi> they would not in reality
have leſs Law, but Mankind would be ſo
ſtruck with this unuſual Object, that it
would be a great while before they could
think it poſſible to receive Juſtice from Men
ſo Accouter'd.</p>
                  <p>It is to ſome degree the ſame thing in
this Caſe; ſuch Martial Habits, Blue-Coats,
Red Stockings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make them look
very unlike Grave Senators. One would
almoſt ſwear they were Creatures apart,
and of a differing Species from the reſt of
the Body.</p>
                  <p>In former times, when only the Reſiant
Shopkeeper was to Repreſent his Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(which by the way is the Law ſtill
at this day) the Military Looks of one of
theſe Sons of <hi>Mars,</hi> would have ſtared the
Quaking Member down again to his Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</p>
                  <p>Now the number of them is ſo encreaſed,
that the Peaceable part of the Houſe may
lawfully ſwear they are in fear of their
Lives, from ſuch an Awful Appearance
of Men of War.</p>
                  <p>It maketh the Room look like a Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
by ſuch an ill-ſuited mixture. But
this is only the out-ſide, the bark of the
Argument; the root goeth yet deeper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Chuſing ſuch Men, whoſe Talents
ought to be otherwiſe applied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52156:163"/>
Their Two Capacities are ſo inconſiſtent,
that Mens undertaking to ſerve both the
Cures, will be the cauſe in a little time,
that we ſhall neither have Men of War,
nor Men of Buſineſs, good in their ſeveral
kinds.</p>
                  <p>An Officer is to give up his Liberty to
obey Orders; and it is neceſſarily incident
to his Calling that he ſhould do ſo.</p>
                  <p>A Member of Parliament is originally
to be tender of his own Liberty, that other
Men may the better truſt him with theirs.</p>
                  <p>An Officer is to enable himſelf by his
Courage, improved by Skill and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
to ſupport the Laws (if Invaded)
when they are made; but he is not ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be at leiſure enough to underſtand
how they ſhould be made.</p>
                  <p>A Member of Parliament is to fill his
thoughts with what may beſt conduce to
the Civil Adminiſtration; which is enough
to take up the whole Man, let him be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo much raiſed above the ordinary
Level.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two oppoſite Qualifications, being
placed in one Man, make him ſuch an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous
divided Creature, that he doth not
know how to move.</p>
                  <p>It is beſt to keep Men within their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Sphere; few Men have Underſtanding
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52156:164"/>
enough exactly to fill even one narrow
Circle, fewer are able to fill two; eſpecially
when they are both of ſo great compaſſ,
and that they are ſo contrary in their own
Natures.</p>
                  <p>The Wages he hath as a Member, and
thoſe he receiveth as an Officer, are paid
for Services that are very differing; and
in the doubt which of them ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrably
performed, it is likely the greater
Salary may direct him, without the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inducements of complying moſt,
where he may expect moſt advantage by
it.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, if his dependance is not very
great, it will make him a ſcurvy Officer; if
it is great, it will make him a ſcurvier
Member.</p>
                  <p>XVIII. Men under the ſcandal of being
thought private Penſioners, are too fair
a mark to eſcape being conſider'd, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the point in Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>In caſe of plain Evidence, it is not to be
ſuppos'd poſſible, that Men convicted of
ſuch a Crime ſhould ever again be Elected.</p>
                  <p>The difficulty is in determining what is
to be done in caſe of ſuſpicion.</p>
                  <p>There are ſuſpicions ſo well grounded,
that they may pretend to have the force
of proofs, provided the penalty goeth only
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52156:164"/>
to the forbearing to Truſt, but not extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſo far as to Puniſh.</p>
                  <p>There muſt be ſome things plain and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
to juſtify the latter, but Circumſtances
may be ſufficient for the former: As where
Men have had ſuch ſudden Cures of their
ill Humours, and oppoſition to the Court,
that it is out of the way of ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of recovery from ſuch Diſtempers,
which have a much ſlower progreſs; it
muſt naturally be imputed to ſome Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
that maketh ſuch a quick alteration of
the whole Maſs of Blood.</p>
                  <p>Where Men have raiſed their way of
Living, without any viſible means to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them in it, a ſuſpicion is juſtified, even
by the Example of the Law, which in caſes
of this kind, though of an inferior nature,
doth upon this foundation not only raiſe
Inferences, but inflict Puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>Where Men are immoral, and ſcandalous
in their Lives, and diſpenſe familiarly with
the Rules by which the World is Govern'd,
for the better preſerving the bonds of
human Society; it muſt be a confidence
very ill placed, to conclude it impoſſible
for ſuch Men to yield to a Temptation well
offer'd and purſu'd; when, the truth is
the habit of ſuch <hi>Bons vivants,</hi> which is the
faſhionable word, maketh a ſuſpicion ſo
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52156:165"/>
likely, that it is very hard not to believe
it to be true.</p>
                  <p>If there ſhould be nothing but the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Report, even that is not to be neglected.</p>
                  <p>Common Fame is the only Lyar that
deſerveth to have ſome Reſpect ſtill reſerv'd
to it; tho ſhe telleth many an Untruth,
ſhe often hits right, and moſt eſpecially
when ſhe ſpeaketh ill of men.</p>
                  <p>Her Credit hath ſometimes been carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
too far, when it hath gone to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting
men of any thing of which they
were poſſeſs'd, without more expreſs evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to juſtify ſuch a proceeding.</p>
                  <p>If there was a doubt whether there ever
was any Corruption of this kind it would
alter the Queſtion; but ſure that will not
bear the being controverted.</p>
                  <p>We are told; That <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth ſent
over into <hi>England</hi> 1200000 Crowns to be
diſtributed amongſt the Leading Men, to
encourage them to carry on Elections.</p>
                  <p>Here was the Proteſtant Religion to be
bought out for a valuable Conſideration
according to Law, though not according
to Goſpel, which exalteth it above any
Price that can be ſet upon it.</p>
                  <p>Now, except we had reaſon to believe
that the Vertue of the World is improv'd
ſince that time, we can as little doubt that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52156:165"/>
ſuch Temptations may be offered, as that
they may be receiv'd.</p>
                  <p>It will be owed, that there is to be a
great tenderneſs in Suſpecting; but it muſt
be allow'd at the ſame time, that there
ought not to be leſt in Truſting, where the
People are ſo much concern'd; eſpecially,
when the Penalty upon the Party ſuſpected
goeth no further than a Suſpenſion of that
Confidence, which it is neceſſary to have in
thoſe who are to repreſent the Nation in
Parliament.</p>
                  <p>I cannot omit the giving a Caution
againſt admitting Men to be choſen, who
have Places of any value.</p>
                  <p>There needeth the leſs to be ſaid upon this
Article, the truth of the Propoſition being
ſupported by ſuch plain Argumen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s.</p>
                  <p>Sure no Man hath ſuch a plentiful ſpring
of Thought, as that all that floweth from
it is too much to be appled to the Buſineſs
of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>It is not leſs ſure, that a Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
of all others, ought not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from the Rule, That no Man ſhould
ſerve two Maſters.</p>
                  <p>It doth ſo ſplit a Man's Thoughts, that
no Man can know how to make a fitting
Diſtribution of them to two ſuch differing
Capacities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:52156:166"/>
It expoſeth Men to be ſuſpected, and
tempted, more than is convenient for the
Publick Service, or for the mutual good
Opinion of one another, which their ought
to be in ſuch an Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>It either giveth a real dependance upon
the Government, which is inconſiſtent with
the neceſſity there is, that a Member of
Parliament ſhould be diſengaged, or at leaſt
it hath the appearance of it, which maketh
them not look like Freemen, though they
ſhould have virtue enough to be be ſo.</p>
                  <p>More Reaſons would leſſen the Weight of
this laſt, which is, That a Bill to this effect,
commonly called the <hi>Self-Denying Bill,</hi> paſs'd
even this laſt Houſe of Commons.</p>
                  <p>A greater Demonſtration of the irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtrength of Truth cannot poſſibly be
given; ſo that a Copy of that Bill in every
County or Burrough, would hardly fail of
diſcouraging ſuch Pretenders from Standing,
or at leaſt it would prevent their Succeſs if
their own Modeſty ſhould not reſtrain them
from attempting it.</p>
                  <p>XX. If Diſtinctions may be made upon
upon particular Men, or Remarks fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Votes in Parliament, they muſt be
allow'd in relation to thoſe Gentlemen,
who for Reaſons beſt known to themſelves
thought fit to be againſt the <hi>Triennial Bill.</hi>

                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:52156:166"/>
The Liberty of Opinion is the thing in
the World that ought leaſt to be controll'd,
and eſpecially in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But as that is an undoubted Aſſertion, it
is not leſs ſo, That when Men Sin againſt
their own Light, give a Vote againſt their
own Thought, they muſt not plead Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of Parliament againſt the being arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for it by others, after they are Convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of it by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>There cannot be a Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of a Houſe of Commons, will ſtate
it to be an Aſſembly, that for the better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing
of Grievances the People feel, and
for the better furniſhing ſuch Supplies as
they can bear, is to continue, if the King ſo
pleaſeth, for his whole Reign.</p>
                  <p>This could be as little intended, as to
throw all into one Hand, and to renounce
the Claim to any Liberty, but ſo much as
the Sovereign Authority would allow.</p>
                  <p>It deſtroyeth the end of Parliaments, it
maketh uſe of the Letter of the Law to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
the Life of it.</p>
                  <p>It is, in truth, ſome kind of Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to ſo plain a thing, that ſo much has
been ſaid and written upon it; and one may
ſay, It is ſuch an Affront to theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Underſtandings to cenſure this Vote
only as a Miſtake, that, as the Age goeth,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52156:167"/>
it is leſs Diſcredit to them to call it by its
right Name; and if that is rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by thoſe who are to chuſe them, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they will let them exerciſe their Liberty
of Conſcience at home, and not make Men
their Truſtees, who in this Solemn Inſtance
have ſuch an unwillingneſs to ſurrender.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be own'd, That this Bill hath met
with very hard Fortune, and yet that doth
not in the leaſt diminiſh the value of it.</p>
                  <p>It had in it ſuch a Root of Life, that it
might be ſaid, It was not Dead but Sleeped;
and we ſee that the laſt Seſſion, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
and animated by the Royal Aſſent,
when once fully inform'd of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
as well as of the Juſtice of it.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, after having told my
Opinion, Who ought not to be Choſen:</p>
                  <p>If I ſhould be ask'd, Who ought to be,
my Anſwer muſt be, chuſe <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> and
when I have ſaid that, to deal honeſtly, I
will not undertake that they are eaſy to be

SEA, 1694.</head>
                  <p>I Will make no other Introduction to
the following Diſcourſe, than that as the
Importance of our being ſtrong at <hi>Sea,</hi>
was ever very great, ſo in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Circumſtances it is grown to be much
greater; becauſe, as formerly our Force of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52156:169"/>
Shipping contributed greatly to our <hi>Trade</hi>
and Safety. So, now it is become indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
neceſſary to our very <hi>Being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid now to <hi>England, Martha,
Martha,</hi> thou art buſy about many things,
but one thing is neceſſary to the Queſtion,
What ſhall we do to be ſaved in this World?
There is no other Anſwer but this, Look to
your Moate.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Article of an <hi>Engliſh-mans</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Creed muſt be, That he believeth in
the Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without that there needed no
General Council to pronounce him capable
of Salvation here.</p>
                  <p>We are in an Iſland confin'd to it by
God Almighty, not as a Penalty but a
Grace, and one of the greateſt that can be
given to Mankind. Happy Confinement
that has made us Free, Rich, and Quiet;
a fair Portion in this World, and very well
worth the preſerving, a Figure that ever
hath been envied, and could never be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by our Neighbours. Our Situation
hath made Greatneſs abroad by Land Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
unnatural things to us. It is true,
we made Excurſions, and glorious ones too,
which make our Names great in Hiſtory,
but they did not laſt.</p>
                  <p>Admit the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be Giants in Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
yet they muſt not hope to ſucceed in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52156:169"/>
making War againſt Heaven, which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to have enjoyned them to acquieſce
in being happy within their own Circle.
It is no Paradox to ſay, that <hi>England</hi> hath
its Root in the Sea, and a deep one too,
from whence it ſendeth its Branches into
both the <hi>Indies.</hi> We may ſay further in our
preſent Caſe, That if <hi>Allegiance</hi> is due to
<hi>Protection,</hi> ours to the Sea is due from that
Rule, ſince by that, and by that alone, we
are to be protected; and if we have of late
ſuffered Uſurpation of other Methods, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Homage we owe to that which
muſt preſerve us. It is time now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
the <hi>Sea</hi> to its right; and as there is
no Repentance effectual without Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſo there is not a moment to be loſt
in their going about it.</p>
                  <p>It is not pretended to launch into ſuch
a Voluminous Treatiſe, as to ſet down
every thing to which ſo comprehenſive a
Subject might lead me; for as the Sea hath
little leſs variety in it than the Land; ſo
the Naval Force of <hi>England</hi> extendeth it
ſelf into a great many Branches, each of
which are important enough to require a
Diſcourſe apart, and peculiarly applied to
it: But there muſt be preference to ſome
Conſideration above others, when the
weight of them is ſo viſibly Superior that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52156:170"/>
it cannot be conteſted. It is there, firſt,
that the Foundations are to be laid of our
Naval Oeconomy; amongſt theſe, there is
one Article which in its own Nature muſt
be allowed to be the Corner-ſtone of the
Building.</p>
                  <p>The Choice of <hi>Officers,</hi> with the <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi>
and <hi>Encouragement</hi> belonging to them.
Upon this Head only, I ſhall then take the
liberty to venture my Opinion into the
World, with a real Submiſſion to thoſe, who
may offer any think better for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the <hi>Publick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt Queſtion then will be, Out of
what ſort of Men the <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Fleet</hi>
are to be choſen; and this immediately
leadeth us to the preſent Controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and the <hi>Tarpau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſual Objection on both ſides are
too general to be relied upon. Partiality
and Common Prejudices direct moſt Mens
Opinions, without entring into the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Reaſons which ought to be the ground
of it. There is ſo much eaſe in aquieſcing
in Generals, that the Ignorance of thoſe
who cannot diſtinguiſh, and the Largeneſs
of thoſe who will not, maketh Men very
apt to decline the trouble of ſtricter Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which they think too great a price
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52156:170"/>
for being in the right, let it be never ſo
valuable.</p>
                  <p>This maketh them judge in the Lump,
and either let their Opinions ſwim along
with the Stream of the World, or give
them up wholly to be directed by Succeſs.
The effect of this is, that they change
their Minds upon every preſent uneaſineſs,
wanting a ſteady Foundation upon which
their Judgment ſhould be formed. This is
a pearching upon the Twigs of things,
and not going to the Root. But ſure the
Matter in queſtion deſerveth to be examined
in another manner, ſince ſo much depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon it.</p>
                  <p>To ſtate the thing impartially, it muſt
be owned that it ſeemeth to lye faireſt for
the <hi>Tarpaulin:</hi> It giveth an Impreſſion
that muſt have ſo much weight as to make
a Man's Opinion lean very much on that
ſide, it carrieth ſo much Authority with it,
it ſeemeth to be ſo unqueſtionable, that
thoſe are fitteſt to Command at Sea, who
have not only made it their <hi>Calling,</hi> but
their <hi>Element;</hi> that there muſt naturally
be a prejudice to any thing then can be
ſaid againſt it. There muſt therefore be
ſome Reaſon extraordinary to ſupport the
Argument on the other ſide, or elſe the
Gentlemen could never enter the Liſts
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52156:171"/>
againſt ſuch a violent Objection, which
ſeemeth not to be reſiſted. I will intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
my Argument with an Aſſertion,
which as I take to be true almoſt in all
Caſes, ſo it is neceſſary to be explained and
inforced in this. The <hi>Aſſertion</hi> is, that
there is hardly a ſingle Propoſition to be
made, which is not deceitful, and the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Reaſon too cloſe to it, may in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Caſes be deſtructive. Circumſtances
muſt come in, and are to be made a part
of the Matter of which we are to judge;
poſitive <hi>Deciſions</hi> are always dangerous,
more eſpecially in <hi>Politicks.</hi> A Man, who
will be Maſter of an Argument, muſt do
like a skilful General, who ſendeth Scouts
on all ſides, to ſee whether there may not
be an Enemy. So he muſt look round to
ſee what Objections can be made, and
not go on in a ſtreight Line, which in
the ready way to lead him into a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.</p>
                  <p>Before then, that we conclude what ſort
of Men are fitteſt to Command at Sea, a
Principle is to be laid down, that there is
a differing Conſideration to be had of ſuch
a Subject-matter, as is in it ſelf diſtinct and
independent, and of ſuch a one as being a
Limb of a Body, or a Wheel of a Frame,
there is a neceſſity of ſuiting it to the reſt,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52156:171"/>
and preſerving the Harmony of the whole.
A Man muſt not in that Caſe reſtrain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the ſeperate Conſideration of that
ſingle Part, but muſt take care it may fall
in and agree with the Shape of the whole
Creature, of which it is a Member. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Propoſition, which I take
to be indiſputable, it will not I hope appear
an Affectation, or an extravagant Fit of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
Politicks, if, before I enter into
the particular State of the preſent Queſtion,
I ſay ſomething of the Government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and make that the Ground-work of
what ſort of Men are moſt proper to be
made uſe of to Command at Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Forms of Government to which
<hi>England</hi> muſt be ſubjected, are either <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Monarchy,</hi> a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> or a
<hi>Mixt Monarchy,</hi> as it is now; with thoſe
natural Alterations that the Exegency of
Affairs may from time to time ſuggeſt. As
to Abſolute Monarchy I will not allow
my ſelf to be tranſported into ſuch Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives,
as are generally made.againſt it;
neither am I ready to enter into the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
Stile of calling every thing <hi>Slavery,</hi>
that reſtraineth Men in any part of their
Freedom: One may diſcern in this, as in
moſt other things, the good and bad of it.
We ſee by too near an Iſtance, what <hi>Fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52156:172"/>
doth by it; it doth not only ſtruggle with
the reſt of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> but is in a fair way
of giving Law to it.</p>
                  <p>This is owing in great Meaſure to a
<hi>Deſpotick</hi> and Undivided Power; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable
Authority of the Directive
Councils maketh every thing move with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Diſorder or Oppoſition, which muſt
give an advantage, that is plain enough
of it ſelf, without being proved by the
melancholly Experience we have of it at
this time.</p>
                  <p>I ſee and admire this; yet I conſider at
the ſame time, that all things of this kind
are comparative: That as on one ſide,
without <hi>Government</hi> Men cannot enjoy
what belongeth to them in particular, nor
can a Nation be ſecure, or preſerve it ſelf in
general: So on the other ſide, the end of
<hi>Government</hi> being, that Mankind ſhould
live in ſome competent State of Freedom,
it is very unnatural to have the <hi>End</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
by the <hi>Means</hi> that were originally
made uſe of to attain it. In this reſpect
ſomething is to be ventured, rather than
ſubmit to ſuch a precarious State of Life,
as would make it a Burthen to a reaſonable
Creature; and therefore, after I have own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Advantages in ſome kind of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted
Government; yet, while they are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52156:172"/>
attended with ſo many other diſcouraging
Circumſtances, I cannot think but that
they may be bought too dear; and if it
ſhould be ſo, that it is not poſſible for a
<hi>State</hi> to be <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Glorious,</hi> unleſs the
Subjects are <hi>wretchedly Miſerable.</hi> I am
aſhamed to own my low-ſpirited frailty
in preferring ſuch a Model of Government,
as may agree with the reaſonable Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a <hi>Free People,</hi> before ſuch a one,
by which Empire is to be extended at ſuch
an unnatural Price. Beſides whatever Mens
Opinions may be one way or another, in
the general Question, there is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in our Caſe that ſhutteth the Door to
any Anſwer to it. (<hi>Viz.</hi>) We cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
under a <hi>Deſpotick</hi> Power, our very
Being would be deſtroyed by it; for we
are to conſider, we are a very little Spot
in the Map of the World, and make a great
Figure only by <hi>Trade,</hi> which is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Liberty; one deſtroyed, the other
falleth to the Ground by a natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that will not admit a diſpute. If
we would be meaſured by our Acres, we
are poor inconſiderable People; we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
above our natural Bounds, by our
good Laws, and our excellent Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
By this we are not only happy at
Home, but conſiderable Abroad. Our Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52156:173"/>
our Humour, our Trade, do all
concur to ſtrengthen this Argument. So
that all other Reaſons muſt give place to
ſuch a one as maketh it out, that there is
no Mean between a <hi>Free Nation</hi> and <hi>No
Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are no more a People, nor <hi>England</hi>
can no longer keep its Name from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that our Liberties are extinguiſh'd;
the Vital Strength that ſhould ſupport us
being withdrawn, we ſhould then be no
more than the Carcaſs of a Nation, with
no other Security than that of <hi>Contempt;</hi>
and to ſubſiſt upon no other Tenure, than
that we ſhould be below the giving Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to our ſtronger Neighbours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
us. In my Judgment, therefore, there
is ſuch a.ſhort Deciſion to be made upon
this Subject, that in Relation to <hi>England,</hi>
an <hi>Abſolute Monarchy</hi> is as an unreaſonable
thing to be wiſhed, as I hope it will be
impoſſible to be obtained.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be conſidered in the next place,
whether <hi>England</hi> likely is to be turn'd into
a Commonwealth. It is hard at any time
to determine what will be the Shape of
the next Revolution, much more at this
time would it be inexcuſably Arrogant to
undertake it. Who can foreſee whether it
will be from without, or from within, or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52156:173"/>
from both? Whether with or without the
Concurrence of the People? Whether regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
produced, or violently impoſed? I ſhall
not therefore <hi>Magiſterially</hi> declare it impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> ſhould be ſettled
here; but I may give my humble Opinion,
that according to all appearances, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
improbable.</p>
                  <p>I will firſt lay it down for a Principle,
That it is not a ſound way of arguing, to
ſay, That if it can be made out, that the
Form of a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> will beſt ſuit
with the Intereſt of the Nation, it muſt for
that reaſon of neceſſity prevail.</p>
                  <p>I will not deny but that <hi>Intereſt</hi> will not
lie, is a right <hi>Maxim,</hi> where-ever it is ſure
to be underſtood; elſe one had as good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
That no Man in particular, nor Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in general, can ever be miſtaken. A
Nation is a great while before they can ſee,
and generally they muſt feel firſt before
their Sight is quite cleared. This <hi>maketh</hi>
it ſo long before they can ſee their <hi>Intereſt;</hi>
that for the moſt part it is too late for them
to purſue it: If Men muſt be ſuppoſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to follow their true <hi>Intereſt,</hi> it muſt
be meant of a New Manufactory of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
by God Almighty; there muſt be
ſome new <hi>Clay,</hi> the old <hi>Stuff</hi> never yet
made any ſuch infallible Creature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52156:174"/>
This being premis'd, it is to be inquired,
Whether inſtead of inclination, or a leaning
towards a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> there is not in
<hi>England</hi> a general diſlike to it; if this be ſo
as I take it to be, by a very great diſparity
in Numbers; it will be in vain to diſpute
the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> whilſt <hi>Humour</hi> is againſt it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the weight that is due to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which may be alledged for it; yet,
if the <hi>Herd</hi> is againſt it, the going about
to convince them, would have no other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
than to ſhew that nothing can be more
impertinent than good <hi>Reaſons,</hi> when they
are miſplaced or ill-timed.</p>
                  <p>I muſt obſerve, That there muſt be ſome
previous Diſpoſitions in all great Changes
to facilitate and to make way for them:
I think it not at all abſur'd, I affirm That
ſuch Reſolutions are ſeldem made at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by the general Preparations of Mens
Minds they are half made before, and it is
plainly viſible, that Men go about them.</p>
                  <p>Though it ſeemeth to me that the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alone maketh all others unneceſſary, yet
I muſt take notice that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides what hath
been ſaid upon this Subject, there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Preliminaries to the firſt building a
<hi>Commonwealth.</hi> Some Materials abſolutely
neceſſary for the carrying on ſuch a <hi>Fabick,</hi>
which at preſent are wanting amongſt us,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52156:174"/>
I mean <hi>Virtue, Morality, Diligence,</hi> or at
leaſt <hi>Hypocriſy.</hi> Now this Age is ſo plain
dealing, as not to diſſemble ſo far as to an
outward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pretence of <hi>Qualities</hi> which ſeem at
preſent ſo <hi>Vnfaſhionable,</hi> and under ſo much
Diſcountenance.</p>
                  <p>From hence we may draw a plain and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Inference, That a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> is
not fit for us, becauſe we are not fit for a
<hi>Commonwealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being granted, the Suppoſition of
this Form of Government of <hi>England,</hi> with
all its Conſequences as to the preſent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
muſt be excluded; and <hi>Abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi>
having been ſo too by the Reaſons
at once alledged, it will without further
Examination fall to a <hi>Mixt Government,</hi>
as we now are. I will not ſay, that there
is never to be any Alteration; the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the ſeveral Parts that concur to
make up the Frame of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
may be altered in many things, in
ſome for the better, and in others, perhaps
for the worſe, according as Circumſtances
ſhall ariſe to induce a <hi>Change;</hi> and as Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
and Intereſt ſhall have more or leſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the Publick Councils; but
ſtill, if it remaineth in the whole ſo far a
a <hi>mixt Monarchy,</hi> that there ſhall be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
upon the <hi>Prince,</hi> as to the Exerciſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52156:175"/>
of a <hi>Deſpotick Power,</hi> it is enough to make
it a Groundwork for the preſent Queſtion.
It appeareth then that a <hi>bounded Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>
is that kind of Government which will
moſt probably prevail and continue in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
from whence it muſt follow (as hath
been hinted before) that every conſiderable
Part ought to be ſo compoſed, as the better
to conduce to the preſerving the Harmony
of the whole Conſtitution. The <hi>Navy</hi> is of
ſo great Importance, that it would be diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by calling it leſs than the <hi>Life</hi> and
<hi>Soul</hi> of Government.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to apply the Argument to the
Subject we are upon; in caſe the <hi>Officers</hi>
be all <hi>Tarpaulins,</hi> it would be in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
too great a tendency to a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;</hi>
ſuch a part of the Conſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Democratically</hi> diſpoſed may be ſuſpected
to endeavour to bring it into that Shape;
where the influence muſt be ſo ſtrong, and
the Suppoſition will be the more juſtifiable.
In ſhort, if the <hi>Maritim Force,</hi> which is the
only thing that can defend us, ſhould be
wholly directed by the lower ſort of Men,
with an intire Excluſion of the <hi>Nobility</hi> and
<hi>Gentry;</hi> it will not be eaſy to anſwer the
Arguments ſupported by ſo great a probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that ſuch a Scheme would not only
lean toward a <hi>Domocracy,</hi> but directly lead
us into it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52156:175"/>
Let us now examine the contrary Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
(<hi>viz.) that all Officers ſhould be
Gentlemen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Objection lierh ſo fair of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
an <hi>Arbitrary Government,</hi> that
it as little to be anſwered in that reſpect, as
the former is in the other. <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in
a general Definition, will be ſuſpected to lie
more than other Men, under the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of being made Inſtruments of unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Power; their Relations, their Way of
Living, their Taſt of the Entertainments of
the <hi>Court,</hi> inſpire an Ambition that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
draweth their Inclinations toward it,
beſides the gratifying of their Intereſts.
Men of Quality are often taken with the
Ornaments of Government, the Splendor
dazleth them ſo, as that their Judgments
are ſurprized by it; and there will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſome that have ſo little remorſe for
invading other Mens Liberties, that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
them leſs ſolicitous to preſerve their
own.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things throw them naturally into
ſuch a dependance as might give a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Biaſs; if they alone were in Command
at Sea, it would make that great Wheel turn
by an irregular Motion, and inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chief means of preſerving the whole
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52156:176"/>
Frame, might come to be the chief Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to diſcompoſe and diſſolve it.</p>
                  <p>The two further excluſive Propoſitions
being neceſſarily to be excluded in this
Queſtion, there remaineth no other Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient;
neither can any other Concluſion be
drawn from the Argument as it hath been
ſtated, than that there muſt be a mixture
in the Navy of <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Tarpaulins,</hi> as
there is in the Conſtition of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi> This Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not to be ſo rigorouſly defined, as
to ſet down the exact Proportion there is
to be of each; the greater or leſſer Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
muſt be directed by Circumſtances, of
which the Government is to Judge, and
which makes it improper to ſet ſuch Rounds,
as that upon no occaſion it ſhall on either
ſide be leſſened or enlarged. It is poſſible
the Men of <hi>Wapping</hi> may think they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured,
by giving them any Partners in the
Dominion of the <hi>Sea;</hi> they may take it
unkindly to be joſtled in their own <hi>Element</hi>
by Men of ſuch a different Education, that
they may be ſaid to be of another Species;
they will be apt to think it an Uſurpation
upon them, and notwithſtanding the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
that are againſt them, and which
give a kind of Preſcription on the other
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52156:176"/>
ſide, they will not eaſily acquieſce in what
they conceive to be a hardſhip to them.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall in a good meaſure reconcile
my ſelf to them by what follows; (<hi>viz.</hi>)
The <hi>Gentlemen</hi> ſhall not be capable of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Office at <hi>Sea,</hi> except they be <hi>Tarpau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi>
to; that is to ſay, except they are ſo
trained up by a continued habit of living at
<hi>Sea,</hi> that they may have a Right to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
free <hi>Denizens</hi> of <hi>Wapping</hi> Upon
this dependeth the whole Matter; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
here lieth the difficulty, becauſe the
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> brought up under the Connivance
of a looſer Diſcipline, and of an eaſier ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance,
will take it heavily to be reduced
within the <hi>Fetters</hi> of ſuch a <hi>New Model;</hi>
and I conclude, they will be extreamly
averſe to that which they call an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Yoke upon them, that their Original
Conſent is never to be expected. But if it
appeareth to be convenient, and which is
more, that it is neceſſary for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole, that it ſhould be ſo; the
Government muſt be call'd in Aid to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
theſe firſt Boilings of Diſcontent; the
Rules muſt be impoſed with ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and the Execution of them muſt be ſo
well ſupported, that by degrees their Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
will be ſubdued, and they will concu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52156:177"/>
in an Eſtabliſhment to which they will eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day be more reconciled.</p>
                  <p>They will find it will take away the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
which are now thrown upon them,
of ſetting up for Maſters, without having
even been Apprentices; or at leaſt, without
having ſerved out their Time.</p>
                  <p>Mankind naturally ſwelleth againſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Partiality; their belief of their
own Merit maketh Men object them to a
proſperous Competitor, even when there is
no pretence for it; but when there is the
leaſt handle offered, to be ſure it will be
taken. So, in this Caſe, when a <hi>Gentleman</hi>
is preferr'd at <hi>Sea,</hi> the <hi>Tarpaulin</hi> is very apt
to impute it to Friend or Favour: But if
that <hi>Gentleman</hi> hath before his Preferment
paſſed through all the Steps which lead to
it, that he ſmelleth as much of <hi>Pitch</hi> and
<hi>Tar,</hi> as thoſe that were <hi>Swadled</hi> in <hi>Sail-Cloath;</hi>
his having an <hi>Eſcutcheon</hi> will be ſo
far from doing him harm, that it will ſet
him upon the advantage Ground: It will
draw a real Reſpect to his Quality when ſo
ſupported, and give him an Influence, and
and Authority infinitely ſuperior to that
which the <hi>meer Sea men</hi> can ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52156:177"/>
When a <hi>Gentleman</hi> hath learned how to
<hi>Obey,</hi> he will grow very much fitter to
<hi>Command;</hi> his own Memory will adviſe
him not to inflict too rigorous Puniſhments.
He will better reſiſt the Temptations of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
(which are great) when he reflecteth
how much he hath at other times wiſhed it
might be gently exerciſed, when he was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Rigour of it.</p>
                  <p>When the undiſtinguiſh'd <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of a
Ship hath tamed the young Maſterſhip,
which is apt to ariſe from a <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s, Birth
and Education. He then groweth Proud
in the right place, and valueth himſelf firſt
upon knowing his Duty, and then upon
doing it.</p>
                  <p>In plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Men of <hi>Quality</hi> in their
ſeveral Degrees muſt either reſtore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to a better Opinion, both for <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
and <hi>Diligence,</hi> or elſe <hi>Quality</hi> it ſelf
will be in danger of being extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>The Original <hi>Gentleman</hi> is almoſt loſt in
ſtrictneſs, when Poſterity doth not ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adorn by their Virtue. The Eſcutcheon
their Anceſtors firſt got for them by their
Merit, they deſerve the Penalty of being
deprived of it.</p>
                  <p>To expect that <hi>Quality</hi> alone ſhould waft
Men up into <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Imployments,</hi> is
as unreaſonable, as to think that a Ship,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52156:178"/>
becauſe it is Carved and Gilded, ſhould be
fit to go to <hi>Sea</hi> without <hi>Sails</hi> or <hi>Tackling.</hi>
But when a <hi>Gentleman</hi> maketh no other uſe
of his <hi>Quality,</hi> than to incite him the more to
his Duty, it will give ſuch a true and ſettled
<hi>Superiority,</hi> as muſt deſtroy all Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from thoſe that are below him.</p>
                  <p>It is time now to go to the Probationary
Qualifications of an <hi>Officer</hi> at <hi>Sea:</hi> And I
have ſome to offer, which I have digeſted
in my Thoughts, I hope impartially, that
they may not be Speculative Notions, but
things eaſy and practicable, if the directing
Powers will give due Countenance and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to the Execution of them:
But whilſt I am going about to ſet them
down, though this little <hi>Eſſay</hi> was made to
no other <hi>End,</hi> than to introduce them, I
am upon better Recollection, induced to
put a reſtraint upon my ſelf, and rather
retract the Promiſe I made at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
than by adviſing the particular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
by which I conceive the good <hi>End</hi>
that is aimed at may be obtained, to incur
the Imputation of the thing of the World,
of which I would leaſt be guilty, which is
of anticipating, by my private Opinion,
the Judgment of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> or ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of my ſlender Stock of Reaſon to
dictate to the Supream Wiſdom of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52156:178"/>
They will, no doubt, conſider the
preſent Eſtabliſhments for <hi>Diſcipline</hi> at <hi>Sea,</hi>
which are many of them very good, and
if well executed, might go a great way in
the preſent Queſtion. But I will not ſay
they are ſo perfect, but that other may be
added to make them more effectual, and
that ſome more Supplemental Expedients
may be neceſſary to compleat what is yet
defective: And whenever the <hi>Parliament</hi>
ſhall think fit to take this Matter into their
Conſideration, I am ſure they will not want
for their Direction, the Auxiliary Reaſons
of any Man without Doors, muchleſs of
one, whoſe Thoughts are ſo intirely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affectedly
reſigned to whatever they ſhall
determine in this, or any thing elſe relating
to the Publick.</p>

                  <p>1. THAT a Prince who falleth out

beſt <hi>Friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That the exalting his own <hi>Authority</hi>
above his <hi>Laws,</hi> is like letting in his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
to ſurprize his <hi>Guards:</hi> The <hi>Laws</hi> are
the only Guards he can be ſure will never
run away from him.</p>
                  <p>3. A <hi>Prince</hi> that will ſay he can do no
Good, except he may do every thing;
teacheth the People to ſay, They are <hi>Slaves,</hi>
if they muſt not do whatever they have a
mind to.</p>

every thing proſpers; where the are ſingle,
they are deſtructive.</p>
                  <p>5. That <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> is like moſt
other things, that are very hard, they are
alſo very apt to break.</p>
                  <p>6. That the profit of Places ſhould be
meaſured as they are more or leſs conducing
to the <hi>Publick Service;</hi> and if Buſineſs is
more neceſſary than Splendor, the,Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it ought in Proportion to be better

as it would be to let the.Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of a Ship coſt more than all the reſt
of it.</p>
                  <p>7. That where the leaſt uſeful part of
the People have the moſt Credit with the
<hi>Prince,</hi> Men will conclude, That the way
to get every thing, is to be good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>8. That an extravagant Gift to one Man,
raiſeth the Market to every body elſe; ſo
that in conſequence, the unlimitted Bounty
of an unthinking Prince maketh him a <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi>
let him have never ſo much <hi>Money.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. That if ordinary Beggars are <hi>whip'd,</hi>
the daily Beggars in fine Cloaths (out of

ought to be <hi>hanged.</hi>
                  </p>

10. That <hi>Pride</hi> is as loud a Beggar as
Want, and a great deal more Sawcy.</p>
                  <p>11. That a <hi>Prince,</hi> who will give more to

a Proclamation to all his Loving Subjects,
forbidding them to do well, upon the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of being undone by it.</p>
                  <p>12. That a wiſe <hi>Prince</hi> will not oblige

of <hi>Men</hi> by what they do to one another,
than that they do to him.</p>
                  <p>14. That it is a groſs Miſtake to think,
That a <hi>Knave</hi> between Man and Man, can
be honeſt to a <hi>King,</hi> whom of all other Men
generally they make the leaſt Scruple to
deceive.</p>
                  <p>15. That a <hi>Prince</hi> who can ever truſt

any other <hi>Perſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. That it is not poſſible for a <hi>Prince</hi> to
find out ſuch an <hi>Honeſt Knave,</hi> as will let
no body elſe <hi>Cheat</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>17. That if a <hi>Prince</hi> does not ſhew an
Averſion to <hi>Knaves,</hi> there will be an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that will be very Natural, let it be
never ſo Unmannerly.</p>

                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52156:182"/>
18. That a <hi>Prince</hi> who followeth his own
Opinion to ſoon, is in danger of repenting
it too late.</p>
                  <p>19. That it is leſs dangerous for a <hi>Prince</hi>
to mind too much what the <hi>People</hi> ſay, than
too little.</p>
                  <p>20. That a <hi>Prince</hi> is to take care that
the greater part of the People may not be
angry at the ſame time; for though the
firſt beginning of their <hi>Ill Humour</hi> ſhould be
againſt one another, yet if not ſtopt, it
will naturally end in <hi>Anger</hi> againſt him.</p>
                  <p>21. That if <hi>Princes</hi> would <hi>Reflect</hi> how
much they are in the Power of their <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi>
they would be more circumſpect in
the <hi>Choice</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>22. That a wiſe <hi>Prince</hi> will ſupport good
Servants againſt Mens Anger, and not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
ill ones againſt their Complaint.</p>
                  <p>23. That <hi>Parties</hi> in a <hi>State</hi> generally,
like <hi>Freebooters,</hi> hang out <hi>Falſe Colours;</hi> the
pretence is the <hi>Publick Good;</hi> the real <hi>Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>

where-ever they ſucceed, inſtead of Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their <hi>Victory,</hi> they preſently fall upon
the <hi>Baggage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. That a <hi>Prince</hi> may play ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Two Parties,</hi> that they may in time
join together, and be in earneſt with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52156:182"/>
25. That there is more <hi>Dignity</hi> in open
<hi>Violence,</hi> than in the unskilful <hi>Cunning</hi> of a
<hi>Prince,</hi> who goeth about to <hi>Impoſe</hi> upon the
<hi>People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>26. That the <hi>People</hi> will ever ſuſpect
the <hi>Remedies</hi> for the <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of the <hi>State,</hi>
where they are wholly excluded from ſeeing
how they are prepared.</p>
                  <p>27. That changing <hi>Hands</hi> without chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Meaſures,</hi> is as if a <hi>Drunkard</hi> in a <hi>Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi>
ſhould change his <hi>Doctors,</hi> and not his
<hi>Dyet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. That a <hi>Prince</hi> is to watch that his
<hi>Reaſon</hi> may not be ſo ſubdued by his <hi>Nature,</hi>
as not to be ſo much a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> as to
be juſt in an <hi>Army;</hi> nor ſo much a <hi>Man</hi> of
<hi>War,</hi> as to be out of his <hi>Element</hi> in his
<hi>Counſel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>29. That a <hi>Man</hi> who cannot mind his
own <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> is not to be truſted with the
<hi>King's.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>30. That <hi>Quality</hi> alone ſhould only ſerve
to make a ſhew in the Embroidered Part of
the <hi>Government;</hi> but that <hi>Ignorance,</hi> though
never ſo well born, ſhould never be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to ſpoil the <hi>Publick Buſineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>31. That he who thinks his <hi>Place</hi> below
him, will certainly be below his <hi>Place.</hi>
                  </p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I have too long delay'd my <hi>Thanks</hi> to
you for giving me ſuch an obliging
<hi>Evidence</hi> of your <hi>Remembrance:</hi> That
alone would have been a welcome <hi>Preſent,</hi>
but when join'd with the <hi>Book</hi> in the World
I am the beſt entertain'd with, it raiſeth a
ſtrong deſire in me to be better <hi>known,</hi>
where I am ſure to be ſo much <hi>pleaſed.</hi> I
have till now thought <hi>Wit</hi> could not be
<hi>Tranſlated,</hi> and do ſtill retain ſo much of
that Opinion, that I believe it impoſſible,
except by one whoſe <hi>Genius</hi> cometh up to
that of the <hi>Author.</hi> You have ſo kept the
Original <hi>Strength</hi> of his <hi>Thought,</hi> that it
almoſt tempts a Man to believe the <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration</hi>
of <hi>Souls,</hi> and that his being us'd
to <hi>Hills,</hi> is come into the <hi>Moore-Lands</hi> to
Reward us here in <hi>England,</hi> for doing him
<pb facs="tcp:52156:184"/>
more Right than his <hi>Country</hi> will afford
him. He hath by your means mended his
Firſt <hi>Edition:</hi> To tranſplant and make
him <hi>Ours,</hi> is not only a Valuable <hi>Acquiſition</hi>
to us, but a Juſt <hi>Cenſure</hi> of the Critical <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence</hi>
of thoſe <hi>French Scribblers</hi> who
have taken pains to make little <hi>Cavils</hi> and
<hi>Exceptions,</hi> to leſſen the Reputation of this
great <hi>Man,</hi> whom Nature hath made too
big to Confine himſelf to the Exactneſs of
a Studied Stile. He let his <hi>Mind</hi> have its
full <hi>Flight,</hi> and ſheweth by a generous kind
of <hi>Negligence</hi> that he did not Write for
Praiſe, but to give to the World a true
Picture of himſelf and of Mankind. He
ſcorned <hi>affected Periods,</hi> or to pleaſe the
miſtaken Reader with an empty <hi>Chime</hi> of
<hi>Words.</hi> He hath no <hi>Affectation</hi> to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out, and dependeth wholly upon the
<hi>Natural Force</hi> of what is his own, and the
Excellent Application of what he borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>You ſee, Sir, I have kindneſs enough for
<hi>Monſieur de Montaigne</hi> to be your <hi>Rival,</hi>
but no Body can pretend to be in equal
Competition with you: I do willingly yield
which is no ſmall matter for a Man to do to
a more proſperous <hi>Lover;</hi> and if you will
repay this piece of Juſtice with another,
<pb facs="tcp:52156:185"/>
pray believe, that he who can <hi>Tranſlate</hi>
ſuch an <hi>Author</hi> without doing him wrong
muſt not only make me <hi>Glad</hi> but <hi>Proud</hi>
of being his</p>
