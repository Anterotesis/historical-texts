            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </div>
            <div n="1" type="argument">
               <head>The First Argument.</head>
               <p>WHosoever make a voluntary separation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the whole, true, visible Church of Christ,
are Schismatiques;</p>
               <p>But all those of the English Protestant party, make a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
separation of themselves from the whole true visible
Church of Christ:</p>
               <p>Therefore all those of the English Protestant party are
Schismatiques.</p>
               <p>The first Proposition is evident, and granted by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
when they allowed our Definition to be a <hi>true
Proposition.</hi> We prove the second Proposition.</p>
               <p>Whosoever voluntarily separate themselves from all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
visible Christian Churches in the world of the same
time with them, make a voluntary separation of themselves
from the whole true visible Church of Christ;</p>
               <p>But all those who are of the English Protestant party, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily,
separate themselves from all the particular visible
Christian Churches in the world of the same time with them:</p>
               <p>Therefore all those of the English Protestant party make a
voluntary separation from the whole true visible Church of
Christ.</p>
               <p>The first Proposition is manifest: For in the extent of all
the true visible Christian Churches in the world, must
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52346:3"/>
be contained the whole true visible Church of Christ. The
second Proposition we prove:</p>
               <p>Whosoever voluntarily separate themselves from the present
Eastern and Western Churches, and all Churches in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
voluntarily separate themselves from all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Christian visible Churches in the world, of the same
time with them;</p>
               <p>But all those of the English Protestant Party voluntarily
separate themselves from the present Eastern and Western
Churches, and all Churches in their Communion:</p>
               <p>Therefore all those of the English Protestant party volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
separate themselves from all the particular visible Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Churches in the world, of the same time with them.</p>
               <p>The first Proposition is certainly true. For no Assembly or
Congregation of Christians can be named (which is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
Heretical) that is not contained in this Proposition.
We prove the second by enumeration:</p>
               <p>If they do not so separate themselves, let that Church be
nominated amongst the forementioned, from which they do
not voluntarily separate themselves. It is not (confessedly)
the Roman; for they all profess themselves not to be of her
Communion: Nor the Greek, under obedience to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> for they have as little dependance, or
agreement with that, either in Doctrine, Subjection, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
Rites, or Communion, as they have with the Roman;
our Adversaries producing but four Points wherein they
seemed to agree with Protestants against us; and those either
not of Faith, or clearly mistaken, or not as they are contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
betwixt us. And the same reason proceeds of all
Churches in actual Communion with them. <hi>Ergo,</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Proposition is true.</p>
               <p>It will avail nothing to alledge here, that English Protestants
communicate with many other Reformed Churches beyond
Sea; for all those are comprehended under our terms the
<hi>English Protestant Party;</hi> and it is as evident, that each of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52346:3"/>
those voluntarily separate themselves from all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as it is that these of <hi>England</hi> separate.</p>
               <p>Neither will it excuse them to say, that they only refined
that Church, which they found corrupted and defiled; which
notwithstanding remains still amongst them the very same in
substance that it was before. For it is evident, that all of
them, whether English or others, separated themselves from all
those National Churches and the Pastors of them, who were
in quiet possession of Church-government immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they begun; rejected in all Countries respectively, where
they entred, their Authority, dispossessing them of their Sees
and Cures, intruding themselves into their places, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
tumultuously among themselves particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
and Conventicles, instituting new and unheard of
Rites and Ceremonies, without dependance of any, who
were in possession of Church-government immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them through the whole world: and all this as noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously,
and undeniably, as any Schismatiques ever did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their time: In all which particulars we appeal to the
Historians on both parts, who have writ the Records of
these two last Ages.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="argument">
               <head>The Second Argument.</head>
               <p>Whosoever adhere to Schismatical Pastors (<hi>as Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
is understood in our Definition) are Schismatiques.</p>
               <p>But all English Protestants adhere to Schismatical Pastors,
as <hi>Schismatical</hi> is understood in our Definition:</p>
               <p>Therefore all English Protestants are Schismatiques.</p>
               <p>The first proposition is evident. For those being only such
as separate themselves from the whole true visible Church of
Christ, all who adhere to them, must also separate with them,
and thereby become Schismatiques. The second proposition
we prove.</p>
               <p>Whosoever adhere to those, who are successively Ordained
by such Schismatical Pastors, maintaining the same cause
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52346:4"/>
which they begun, adhere to Schismatical Pastors, as <hi>Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi>
is understood in our Definition;</p>
               <p>But all English Protestants adhere to those, who were suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
Ordained by such <hi>Schismatical</hi> Pastors, maintaining
the same cause which they begun:</p>
               <p>Therefore all English Protestants adhere to Schismatical
Pastours, as <hi>schismatical,</hi> is understood in our Definition.</p>
               <p>The first Proposition needs no proof, as being clear <hi>ex terminis:</hi>
The second, <hi>viz.</hi> that those, whom we say were so
Ordained, maintain the same cause, which was begun by those
who Ordained them, is also clear: it remains therefore only
to prove, that they were Ordained successively by Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
understood in the sense of our Definition: which we
thus prove:</p>
               <p>Whosoever adhere to those, who were successively Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> and the other first Protestant
Bishops of his time, adhere to those, who were successively
Ordained by such Schismatical Pastors;</p>
               <p>But all English Protestants adhere to such, as were suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
Ordained by <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> and the first Protestant
Bishops of his time:</p>
               <p>Therefore all English Protestants adhere to those, who were
successively Ordained by such schismatical Pastors.</p>
               <p>The second Proposition is clear, and confessed by all: We
thus prove the first:</p>
               <p>If <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> and the rest were such schismatical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
then whosoever adhere to those, who were Ordained
by them, adhere to those who were Ordained successively by
such Schismatical Pastors;</p>
               <p>But <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> and the rest were such Schismatical
Pastors.</p>
               <p>Therefore all those, who adhere to those, who were suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
Ordained by them, adhere to those who were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
by such Schismatical Pastors.</p>
               <p>The first proposition is clear: we prove the second.</p>
               <p>Whosoever either Possess the Sees and Offices of lawful
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52346:4"/>
Bishops, those lawful Bishops yet living, or unite themselves
to such as possess them, are such schismatical Pastors;</p>
               <p>But <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> and other first Protestant Bishops of
his time, either possest the Sees and Offices of lawful Bishops,
those lawful Bishops yet living, or united themselves to such
as possest them:</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Matthew Parker,</hi> and all the first Protestant
Bishops of his time, were such schismatical Pastors.</p>
               <p>The first proposition is evident of it self. The first part
of the second proposition, That the Sees, &amp;c. of living Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
were possest, and that others of these new Bishops
united themselves to such as possest them, is also clear, as
matter of fact, out of <hi>Stow, Speed, Cambden, Mason, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win,
Fern, &amp;c.</hi> The second part, <hi>viz.</hi> that those living Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
were lawful Bishops, even when they were deprived,
we prove thus:</p>
               <p>Whosoever were once lawful Bishops, and never did any
thing after, whereby they became unlawful, remained still
lawful Bishops;</p>
               <p>But those deprived Bishops were once lawful Bishops, and
never did any thing after, whereby they became unlawful:</p>
               <p>Therefore those Bishops remained still lawful Bishops.</p>
               <p>The first proposition is evident. The first part of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were once lawful Bishops,
we prove thus:</p>
               <p>No National Church can be a true particular Church of
Christ, unless those who have the place of Bishops in it be
lawful Bishops;</p>
               <p>But the National Church of <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi>
time was a true particular Church of Christ:</p>
               <p>Therefore those, who had the place of Bishops in it, were
lawful Bishops. Now I subsume. But those, who had then
the place of Bishops in that National Church, were those
deprived Bishops: <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first proposition is clear. For no true Church can unite
it self to unlawful Pastors. The second proposition is also
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52346:5"/>
clear from the confession of our Adversaries, who grant, That
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all those of her Communion are
true Churches of Christ. See <hi>Bramhall</hi> and <hi>Fern</hi> upon this
Subject.</p>
               <p>We prove now the second part of the second Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
That those Bishops did nothing, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
unlawful Bishops.</p>
               <p>If those lawful Bishops did any thing, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
unlawful Bishops, it must be supposed to be that for
which they were deprived;</p>
               <p>But that for which they were deprived, did not make
them unlawful Bishops:</p>
               <p>Therefore they did nothing, whereby they became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Bishops.</p>
               <p>The first proposition seems evident. For no prudent man
can suppose, that they would deprive them for that which
made them not unlawful Bishops, if they had been convinced
to have done any other thing which might make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Bishops. The second we prove:</p>
               <p>All the reasons, for which they were deprived, was resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the pretended Reformation, and refusing the Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy;</p>
               <p>But those could not make them unlawful Bishops: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the causes, for which they were deprived, could not
make them unlawful Bishops.</p>
               <p>The first proposition being matter of fact, is witnessed by
<hi>Cambden, Goodwin,</hi> and others. The second proposition we
prove thus:</p>
               <p>No proceeding in practice, according to the common
Tenets, the holding whereof made them not unlawful Bishops,
can make them unlawful Bishops;</p>
               <p>But resisting the pretended Reformation, and refusing
the Oath of Supremacy, was only a proceeding according
to the common Tenets, the holding whereof made them
not unlawful Bishops:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52346:5"/>
Therefore resisting that Reformation, and refusing that
Oath could not make them unlawful Bishops.</p>
               <p>The first proposition is clear in it self: For no man can
be thought to become an unlawful Bishop, <hi>v. g.</hi> by
praying for the souls in Purgatory, if the holding that such
prayers are lawful, make him not an unlawful Bishop; and
so of the rest.</p>
               <p>The second proposition is also evident. For whilst they
were lawful Bishops in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, they held it a
common necessary point of Religion to resist that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and refuse that Oath of Supremacy.</p>
               <p>If it should be replied, that as the Queen had power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
lawful temporal Officers at her pleasure, so might she
also deprive at her pleasure lawful Ecclesiastical Officers
and Bishops, as being no less chief Governour of the Church
then of the Commonwealth; we answer, even that admitted
(not granted) yet this second she could not do: For the
Kings and Queens of <hi>England</hi> pretended only to succeed
into those prerogatives of Church-government, which the
Pope had before them, as is clear in King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. But
the Pope himself had no power to dispossess a lawful Bishop
remaining a lawful Bishop at his pleasure. Therefore neither
had the Queen any such power.</p>

               <head>The Third Argument.</head>
               <p>We prove in this Argument, by another <hi>medium,</hi> that
<hi>Matthew Parker</hi> and his Associates, and consequently all
who adhered to them, or adhere to their Successors were
and are Schismatiques, separate from the whole true visible
Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> was a Shismatique, voluntarily separate
from the whole true visible Church of Christ:</p>
               <p>Therefore all those, who were willingly consecrated by him,
and all their Successors and Adherents, were such Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:52346:6"/>
The Consequence is clear, as appears in the former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument:
The Antecedent we prove.</p>
               <p>Whosoever was willingly consecrated by Schismatiques,
voluntarily separate from the whole true visible Church of
Christ, is himself a Schismatique, voluntarily separate from
the whole true visible Church of Christ;</p>
               <p>But <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> was willingly consecrated by Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques,
voluntarily separate from the whole true visible
Church of Christ:</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Matthew Parker</hi> was a Schismatique, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
separated from the whole true visible Church of Christ.</p>
               <p>The first proposition is already proved. For to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
consecrated by such Schismatiques is schismatical, and
therefore separating from the whole true visible Church of
Christ.</p>
               <p>The second proposition we prove, as matter of fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goodwin</hi> in the different lives of <hi>Barlow, Coverdale, Scory,</hi>
and <hi>Hodgkins,</hi> who were the Consecrators of <hi>Parker,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges,
that the three first were possest of the Sees
and Offices of other Catholick Bishops living. <hi>Barlow</hi> was
intruded into the place of <hi>Christopherson,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Chicester,
Dec.</hi> 20. 1559, and elect to it, before he consecrated <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>
as appears by the Queens Letters, <hi>Gulielmo Barlow, nunc
Cicestriensi electo. Scory</hi> was put by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th
into <hi>Day's</hi> place, then being Bishop of <hi>Chicester. Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi>
into <hi>Vecey's</hi> place, by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, <hi>Aug.</hi> 30.
1551, which B. <hi>Vecey</hi> was forced to resign, as appears by
his being willing to be restor'd (as he was afterwards) by
Queen <hi>Mary. Hodgkins</hi> was only a Suffragan; but commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
with these three in this Consecration; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
became Schismatique.</p>

Schismatiques; But English Protestants, ever since Qu. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebeth</hi>'s
time, have subjected themselves to those, as to their
lawful Pastors, who have no true jurisdiction over them:
Therefore English Protestants, ever since Qu. <hi>Elizabeth's</hi>
time, are Schismatiques.</p>
               <p>The first proposition is clear, from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing
Heretiques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> says, <hi>Ad sua desideria coacerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant
sibi Magistros, &amp;c.</hi> according to their own fancies they
shall heap up Teachers, or Masters, that is, confusedly and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuously,

<hi>Quomodo praedicabunt, nisi mittantur?</hi> How shall they preach,
unless they be sent? Eor their adhering to such, supposes
the rejection of all those who are legally authorized to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
them, which is formal Schism.</p>
               <p>The second proposition we prove by Enumeration.</p>
               <p>They could not have true Jurisdiction over the particular
Bishopricks and Cures of <hi>England;</hi> neither by the force of
Orders which they receiv'd, (if they had any such) for one
may have true Order without any true Jurisdiction, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in the Act of K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8th, concerning Suffragans, who
had true Episcopal Order, and yet had not Episcopal Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as the Act expresly says; and many are made Ministers
in the Universities, before they have any Jurisdiction over
any particular Parishes. Neither could they have it from
those who consecrated them; for never a one of them had
any themselves, as being either Suffragans, or not design<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d to
any See, or elected, and not invested. Neither was there then
any Primate in <hi>England</hi> to give it them. Neither had they
it by general consent of the Bishops of <hi>England;</hi> for they
all resisted. Neither would they have it from the Pope, or
Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> nor would either of them give
it them: Much less had they either from a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
for that was against them: Nor from the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Catholick Bishops, either of the Eastern or Western
Church; for all oppos d them. Neither did their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>superintendents
beyond Sea, or could they confer Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52346:7"/>
upon them; for they were all as void of Jurisdiction as
these themselves were. Neither could they have it from the
Queen or Parliament; for that had been an <hi>heaping up of
Teachers to themselves,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. now cited. And Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Jurisdiction being a Spiritual Government, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. to be a <hi>supernatural gift,</hi> and Institution
of God in his Church; and <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Prophesying,</hi> that is, the
Power of Preaching, is declared to be a <hi>Gift of the Holy

of any Commonwealth. And <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. the Holy
Ghost is said to appoint Bishops <hi>to govern the Church of
God;</hi> and so the giving Jurisdiction to them must be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural,
coming from the Holy Ghost, and above the reach
of politick Governors. And if Kings, Queens, or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
who are under the number of Scholars and Subjects
in matters of Religion, could communicate Ecclesiastical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
to their Prelates, they would be Governors of
their Governors, and Masters of their Masters, which is
quite contrary to <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 24. <hi>Non est Discipulus supra Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrum,</hi>
The Disciple is not above his Master, <hi>i. e.</hi> in those
things wherein he is his Master, which is here in Church-government.
As therefore our Saviour <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.
sent his Apostles with power of Governing and Preaching,
and the Apostles gave that Spiritual Jurisdiction to others,
whom they sent to divers particular Provinces, and those Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Persons only amongst all Orthodox Christians,
still communicated the like Jurisdiction to others, both in
the primitive and after ages; and never did any Catholick
Prince, or State, pretend to confer Jurisdiction upon their
own Bishops, or Pastors: It is most manifest, that neither
Qu. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> nor her Parliament, had any such power:
And consequently it follows from this Enumeration of parts
that those <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Bishops and Pastors had no Jurisdiction
at all, or any of their Successors; and therefore, That all
English Protestants, attributing such Jurisdiction to them
and adhering to them as their lawful Bishops and Pastors
are Formal Schismatiques.</p>
