         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

QUERIES
CONSIDERED;
AND
Some Queries put, for the Consideration of those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
whose Judgments are in danger of being again
Poysoned by the Snare of smooth Words; calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the humour of a Biggot, for the helping the
Indigent Case of King <hi>James,</hi> and Vindicating the
Non-Abdicators.</head>
            <p>1. WHether the Church of <hi>England</hi> ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and very grateful, that the King has so
often declared himself for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> without
obliging his Majesty on pain of their Displeasure (and no
less a Scandal than Presbyterian in his Heart) to subjoyn a
profess'd Abhorrence and inveterate Enmity against all his
Dissenting Subjects?</p>
            <p>2. Whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> or Dissenters have most
made it their Business to Libel the present King, or whether
indeed they ever did Libel him to the Degree of our Query-maker
in his sixth Query; and whether it be the sin against
the Holy Ghost, for the Dissenters to glory in the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of their King, who has given them his Royal Word
for his Favour and Protection in the Liberty of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65415:2"/>
which is so much repined at, and the King so much
hated for?</p>
            <p>3. Whether it be really the Church of <hi>England</hi> (or our
Query-maker only that makes her so) that makes her self a
Sanctuary for all the Offenders of the last Reign? and if so,
What she can answer to her excluding the late King <hi>James,</hi>
while none of his Instruments are thought guilty enough
to suffer, no, nor to be excluded doing the same things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
if they have Opportunity?</p>
            <p>4. Whether also it had not been as mannerly in our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer
to have set down a List of all those Members that
stood in need of Indemnity 1660. to make out that it was
a majority? or whether his Credit be good enough to pass
without Proof, who stands in so much need of an Indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
himself, and of a Pillory now for traducing 146 Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the House of Commons as Republicans or old
Rebels, because against his Will they Voted his present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
King, and took the Sword of Persecution out of the
hand of the Church of <hi>England</hi>?</p>
            <p>5. Whether his third Query be not insinuation enough
to make the Church of <hi>England</hi> loath him, who foster up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them his own Spirit of Blood and War, so contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the known and practised Doctrine of the Church,
Charity and Passive Obedience? and what but Rebellion
can this Libeller insinuate, when he says, the Church of
<hi>England</hi> will be esteem'd Cowards and Stupid, if they do
not awake against those his Majesty has taken into his
Protection?</p>
            <p>6. Whether this Fellow is not a fit Person to be hugg'd
by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that shall boast in Print that
our Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> are but remains of Regiments, and
proposing other means to reduce <hi>Ireland</hi> than giving Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
(<hi>viz.</hi> recalling K. <hi>James</hi>) if he does not mean that,
we desire him to name those other means, not doubting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65415:2"/>
Majesty, as well as the Nation, will take it very kindly of
him, to put us in a way to reduce the Kingdom without
Money, or a way for Money without Taxes?</p>
            <p>7. Whether any Dissenter ever denyed his fifth Query;
or what his reason is for putting it; or how he will prove
all those qualifications upon any Member of the House.</p>
            <p>8. Whether it be sit for this Query-maker to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the Actions of Parliament; and if it be, how he will
make it out that the House changed the Right of Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and how will the Church of <hi>England</hi> answer to a Charge
against their boasted Loyalty, for suffering an Impudent Scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
to call the making his Majesty King, a Voting Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> out of three Kingdoms; or whether this be not such
an Affront to his Majesty and the present Government, as
any Subject that has respect for either cannot but regret?</p>
            <p>9. Whether it is not as likely they should be his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Friends that Voted for making him King, as those
that were against it; and whether ever the King told this
Query-maker, he was sensible they had Republican De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
in doing it?</p>
            <p>10. Whether the Temper of those Members does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
Censure, who were so hasty for a General Pardon,
that they could not stay to think of making Inquisition
for Blood, that so the guilt of all the Blood spilt in the
late Tyranny might devolve on the Nation, but preferr'd
their own security against the lash of the Law, to the just
retribution that God Almighty expected from their hands,
in whom he had placed the dispensing of Justice, and to
the King's being just to his Declaration.</p>
            <p>11. Whether it was not a sign of an excelling Loyalty
in those Members who so carefully provided that the King
should swear at his Coronation to protect the Bishops in
all their Episcopal Rights, who at the same time refused
to swear Allegiance to him, or to own him as their Head.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65415:3"/>
and how much it went against the grain to have them
suspended for it, is discernable in every Query he makes?</p>
            <p>12. Whether Whipping <hi>Oats</hi> was not an Instance of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and Cruelty, in a Nation that of all the World pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to Humanity, and to have no Tortures practised;
and whether the opposing that reversing Vote, was not more
to shew their good Will than any Spleen to the Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</p>
            <p>13. Whether if all these things do not unqualifie a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
for a place in the House, <hi>Qu. 6.</hi> Why being banished
by the Cruelty of an Abdicated Tyrant, should unfit a Man
for the Service of his Countrey, remains to be proved?</p>
            <p>14. Whether the boasting of Loyalty and the Church of
<hi>England</hi> may not evince a Factor for Popery, as well as
saying, I am a true <hi>Engilsh</hi> Man, proves one to be none;
and whether the Loyalty so lately in Vogue, and the Zeal
for the Church, was not more in the Mouths of those very
Men, who since in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> went openly to Mass,
than in any other; and whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> are
not now too much awake to be so ridden again?</p>
            <p>15. Whether <hi>England</hi> is reduced to so much Exigence,
as to make Composition for time with the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
for what they expended on our Account; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this Gentleman is not for lessening our Figure in the
World, and our Value abroad, which is indeed much for
our Interest, by having a Message sent to the States, <hi>viz.
May it please your High and Mightinesses, your poor, and needy
Brethren of</hi> England <hi>are not able yet to repay you, but if you
will have Patience with them, they will be very honest, and
pay you all.</hi> And further, Whether this Gentleman ever
look'd over the Act for repaying the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to see how
many Years it will be before they will have their Money?</p>
            <p>16. Whether the Gentleman did not design to leave some
unanswerable Query in his Paper, by not telling who did
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65415:3"/>
so, that so we might not examine the particular Case; and
whether if any Member saw an Act of Parliament evaded,
and the King cheated, as he was most loyally in that Bill,
it was not a Noble and Generous Honesty to move for a
just Review even among his best Friends?</p>
            <p>17. Whether his <hi>13th.</hi> Query has not a little Nonsense
in it; and whether he can shew any particular quality in
the Parliament of K. <hi>James</hi> the second, to distinguish them
from all Parliaments that ever was, save that there was a
full Brigade of Sword-men in it, for which he in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
quarrels at this Parliament, in which are very few?</p>
            <p>18. Whether any Man may not start Questions that no
Man can Answer? or what Scruples any Man made at the
Actions of K. <hi>James,</hi> which he so much repented of as to
make him desist in Point of Conscience from standing at
the last Election?</p>
            <p>And for a Query by the way; Whether it is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they have some other end than a bare serving their
Countrey in the House, who bid so high for Votes, that
an honest Man that has no self-end cannot afford to give;
and that for the pure and single benefit of Religion, and
propagation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Debauch the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with drunken Treats, to engage them to choose them
to sit in Parliament, that they may plead Priviledge in
Barr of their just<note n="*" place="margin">I do not mean Sir <hi>Peter Rich.</hi>
               </note> Debts; and whether this was not a
grand Reason why a Bill for Regulating Elections has
so often been offered, but could never Pass in the last
House?</p>
            <p>19. Whether the <hi>15th</hi> Query be not the bottom of all
the rest, and the onely Card they have to play, who
watch for our Division to overturn the Government once
again, in hopes of reaping the sweet Harvest of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Calamity, to make amends for their present Poverty,
who formerly made great gain of the Pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65415:4"/>
               <hi>Heu! Quantum profuit haec fabula Christi?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>20. Whether it is likely this Libeller shall be Judge of
the good Nature or sence of the People of <hi>England,</hi> or
that his Opinion must be the Standard of Elections to
come?</p>
            <p>21. Whether his Reflection on Mr. <hi>Sachaveril,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
a List of Members, is not more their Honour and
Vindication than Reflection, especially from his sordid
Scandal on them in his second Query?</p>
            <p>22. Whether, To give one Instance of the Ingenuity and
Generosity of the Party this Fellow pleads for, it be not
very remarkable, how our Four new Candidates for <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
stood by, and see a profligate drunken Fellow, that
calls himself of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> bid the Sheriff of
<hi>London,</hi> executing his Office with unquestionable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputable
Integrity, Kiss his Posteriors on the <hi>Hustings</hi> in
<hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and not so much as Reprove him for it, much
less Commit him, as they ought in Honour to have done?
and whether in doing it they had not gained more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and more vindicable Credit, than by clandestine
Calls on the Livery, forestalling of Votes, and Sunday
Cabals, engaging an Interest for their Election?</p>
            <p>23. Whether the Kings late Letter for the Reforming
the Clergy and the whole Nation, has in it any such hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
thing, as to have it publickly called <hi>A damn'd Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Cant?</hi> And whether the Church it self ever pretended
to be so Infallible as to need no such Admonition, or that
no Reformation can be made in it, either in its Hierarchy
or in its Members, that can fall short of <hi>Presbytery</hi> and
<hi>Phanaticism?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>24. Whether Dr. <hi>Sherlock'</hi>s appearing in the Pulpit after
a Deprivation by Act of Parliament, be not the Effect of
the same Spirit; who being advised by the Learned in the
Law, and permitted by his Superiours in the same Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65415:4"/>
dare openly affront the Government, and bid
Defiance to an Act of Parliament, as a further Testimony
of the Practice as well as Profession of the Doctrine of
Passive Obedience?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Why the Church of <hi>England,</hi> should after all the
Publick Acknowledgments of their calling in the <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>O.</hi>
and after their Solemn Joyning with him in his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
and thanks to him for performing it, and to God
for the Success, now strive to have it agreed, that he came
in by Conquest, which is past my Learning to unriddle, and
very little for the Honour of the Nation for them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>
