            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Dr. HENRY MORE of
Christ's College in CAMBRIDGE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NEither the <hi>Ambition</hi> of honouring this
Discourse with your <hi>Great</hi> Name, nor
the <hi>Vanity</hi> of thinking this slender
Oblation a sufficient discharge from those strong
Obligations whereby I stand endebted to you, were
the Motives which determin'd my Choice in this
Dedication. I intend only hereby to express my
great <hi>Veneration</hi> for your <hi>Worth,</hi> and my <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
for that <hi>Particular</hi> share which you have been
pleas'd to vouchsafe me in your <hi>Favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Discourse which now beggs your
acceptance and protection, I am not unsensible that
much of it lies out of the common road of thinking,
and may upon that Score incur the Censure of those
narrow-spirited <hi>Theorists,</hi> who confine their Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
to the limits of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> resign up the
<pb facs="tcp:62601:3"/>
natural <hi>Prerogative</hi> of their understandings to the
Tyranny of dead Authors, and prefer Lead and
Copper so it wear the <hi>Stamp</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the finest and noblest Metal that has not the
<hi>luck</hi> to be a <hi>Coin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Sir, I need not fear your disapprobation
on this account, whose active. Soul has long
since travers'd o're the whole <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi>
and whose temper is so unprejudic'd and even-pois'd,
as to receive the most Novel <hi>Hypothesis</hi> (were
it possible for any to be such to you) without start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and amusement, and if true, to imbrace it,
tho with the Censure of <hi>Singularity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here Opportunity tempts me to run a long
<hi>Descant</hi> upon your great Worth and the <hi>Variety</hi>
of your Intellectual Accomplishments, but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that should I with the <hi>Athenian</hi> Oratour
imploy Ten years in a <hi>Panegyric,</hi> I could add
nothing either to your <hi>Fame</hi> or to your <hi>Satisfaction,</hi>
and besides I fear I shall sufficiently abuse your
<hi>Patience</hi> in the <hi>following</hi> Papers, and therefore
I am the more concern'd to spare your <hi>Modesty</hi>
in <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I forget how sacred your hours are, and
have perhaps already too much reason to beg your,
and the <hi>Worlds,</hi> pardon for disturbing an excellent
Meditation. For which offence a speedy Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb facs="tcp:62601:3"/>
will be the best <hi>Apology.</hi> I end therefore
with this humble Request, that whatever your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be of this Present as to other respects, you
would not fail to <hi>think</hi> it a sincere Testimony of
that vast esteem which you most deservedly have
in the heart of</p>
            <closer>
               <salute>(SIR,)</salute>

and Humble Servant

SERMON
Preached before the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of OXFORD, &amp;c.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ROM. 12. Chap. v. 3.</bibl>
               <q>—Not to think of himself more highly
than be ought to think; But to think so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly
according as God hath dealt to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man the measure of Faith.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is nothing wherein
men are so much <hi>divided</hi> from
one another as in <hi>Opinions,</hi> and
nothing wherein they una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
<hi>conspire</hi> than in <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well</hi> of <hi>themselves.</hi> This
is a Humour of so <hi>Catholic</hi> a
<hi>Stamp,</hi> and universal <hi>Empire,</hi> that it may seem
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62601:5"/>
to challenge a place among those <hi>Elements</hi> of
our Constitution, those <hi>Essentials</hi> of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which run throughout the <hi>whole</hi> Kind,
and are participated by every <hi>Individual.</hi> For
should a man <hi>take the Wings of the Morning,</hi> and
and travel with the Sun round the Terrestrial
Globe, he would hardly find a man either of
a <hi>Iudgement</hi> so difficult to be <hi>pleas'd,</hi> or of <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment</hi>
so <hi>little</hi> to <hi>recommend</hi> him, that
was not notwithstanding sufficiently in <hi>love</hi>
with himself, however he might dislike every
thing else about him; And without question
that arrogant and peevish <hi>Mathematician</hi> who
charged the grand <hi>Architect</hi> with want of skill
in the <hi>Mechanism</hi> of the World, thought he
had play'd the <hi>Artist</hi> well enough in <hi>himself,</hi>
and as to the <hi>Harmony</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> frame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted
the <hi>Geometry</hi> of his Maker.</p>
            <p>And as men are thus naturally apt to think
well of themselves in general, so there is nothing
wherein they indulge this Humour more than
in the Opinion they have of the <hi>Goods</hi> of the
<hi>Mind,</hi> and among these there is none which
has so great a share of their <hi>Partiality,</hi> as their
<hi>Intellectual</hi> faculty. The <hi>Desire</hi> of Knowledge
is not more natural then the <hi>Conceit</hi> that we are
already furnish'd with a considerable Measure
of it, and tho a particular <hi>Sect</hi> were Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd
by that Appellation, yet all mankind are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62601:5"/>
in reality, <hi>Gnostics.</hi> For as 'tis (ingeniously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
by the excellent <hi>Cartesius</hi>) nothing is more
equally distributed among men than the <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Talent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dissert. de Method. p. 1.</note> wherewith every one fancies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so abundantly stockt, that even those who
have the most <hi>unsatiable</hi> Desires, and whom
Providence could not satisfy in any one thing
else, are notwithstanding as to this <hi>Dispensation</hi>
of Heaven well enough <hi>content,</hi> complain not
of the dull Planet that influenc'd their Nativity,
or wish their minds more <hi>richly endow'd</hi> than
they are. And altho there are a <hi>generation</hi> of
men who use to be very eloquent in setting out
the degeneracy of humane nature in general,
and particularly in decyphering the <hi>Shortness</hi>
of our <hi>Intellectual Sight,</hi> and the defects of our
now <hi>diminish'd</hi> understanding, yet should a man
take them at their word, and apply that <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi>
to themselves in particular which they so
<hi>freely</hi> bestow upon the whole Species, no men in
the world so full of resentment and impatience
as they; and I dare affirm notwithstanding
their <hi>Harangues</hi> upon the Corruption of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Nature, could all mankind lay a <hi>true</hi>
claim to that <hi>Estimate</hi> which they pass upon
<hi>themselves,</hi> there would be little or no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
betwixt <hi>laps'd</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Humanity, and
God might again review his <hi>image</hi> with <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi>
Complacency, and still <hi>pronounce</hi> it <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62601:6"/>Nor is it at all to be wonder'd that <hi>Self-Conceitedness</hi>
should be of such an unlimited
and <hi>Transcendental</hi> Nature as to run through
all Sorts and <hi>Classes</hi> of men, since the cause
of it, <hi>Self-love,</hi> has such an universal <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi>
in our hearts. 'Tis most natural and
necessary for every man (and indeed for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Intelligent Being) to be a Lover of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and to covet whatsoever any way tends
to the perfection of his Nature. And as 'tis
necessary for every man to be thus affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
himself, so is this the only Disposition
of mind wherein Man acts with Constancy
and <hi>Vniformity.</hi> Our other Passions have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
their total intermissions, and at best their
<hi>increases</hi> and <hi>decreases,</hi> but this is<note n="*" place="margin">See my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic Piety Pag. 72 and 73.</note> allways at
<hi>Full,</hi> and stands <hi>drawn</hi> out to the utmost <hi>Stretch</hi>
of its Capacity. No man loves himself more
at one time then at another, and that because
he allways loves himself in the highest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that is possible. <hi>More</hi> than all good he
<hi>cannot</hi> with to himself, and <hi>less</hi> than all he <hi>will</hi>
not, nay I had allmost pronounc'd it impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for Omnipotence it self which <hi>stays the proud
waves</hi> of the Ocean,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> and blocks up its violent
efforts with <hi>barrs and doors,</hi> to say unto this
Passion, <hi>hitherto shalt thou come but no further,</hi>
or to set any other bounds to it besides those
of all <hi>possible</hi> good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62601:6"/>Now Man being such an <hi>infinite</hi> Lover of
himself, is easily brought to <hi>believe</hi> that he is
really Master of many of those excellencies
and perfections, which he so passionately <hi>wishes</hi>
among the <hi>Inventory</hi> of his possessions. For
there is this notorious difference betwixt <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi>
and the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> that whereas the
Love of others <hi>supposes</hi> an opinion of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency,
the love of our selves <hi>begets</hi> it. We
<hi>love</hi> others because we <hi>think well</hi> of them, but
(so preposterous is the method of Self-love)
we think well of our selves because we first
love our selves. So that now upon the whole,
considering how necessarily and vehemently
every man is carried on to the love of himself,
and what a natural product Self-conceit is of
Self-love, 'tis much to be fear'd, that as we cannot
set <hi>any</hi> bounds to the <hi>love</hi> of our selves, so we
shall hardly set <hi>due</hi> ones to our <hi>Opinions</hi> of our
selves, and consequently the most mortify'd
and resign'd Man of us all, has no reason to
think himself unconcern'd in this Admonition
of the Apostle.—<hi>Not to think of himself more
highly than he ought to think; but to think so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
according as God hath dealt to every man
the measure of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis supposed that the Apostle in these words
had respect to the then prevailing Heresy of
<hi>Gnostics,</hi> a sort of men that pretended to great
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62601:7"/>
               <hi>Heights,</hi> of divine Knowledge, to close inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macies
and familiarities with God, and upon
that presumption grew so haughty and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
as to <hi>despise dominions, and speak evil of
dignities,</hi> and withal so careless and secure, as
to <hi>defile the flesh,</hi> and indulge themselves all
manner of Sensuality, as you may see their
Character in the Epistle of St. <hi>Iude.</hi> Nay of
such turbulent ungovernable Principles and
profligate manners were these men, that some
of the Learned (and particularly an eminent
Divine of our own Church) have adventured
to write upon their Fore-heads,<note place="margin">Dr. Hammond</note> 
               <hi>Mystery,</hi> and
to place them in the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Anti-Christ.</hi> As
an Antidote therefore against this Poison, the
Apostle who through the <hi>Abundance of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
had himself been in danger of being <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
above Measure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 7.</note> and experimentally knew
how prone humane nature is to <hi>swell</hi> and <hi>plume</hi>
upon a Conceit of its own excellencies, thought
it expedient to advise his Charge at <hi>Rome</hi> (the
place which <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the Author of that
proud Sect had (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us) made
choice of to be the <hi>Scene</hi> of his Magical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations)
to moderate and sober thoughts of
themselves,<note place="margin">Hist. Eccles. lib. 2. c. 13.</note> and being to teach them a Lesson
of Humility, he modestly ushers it in with a
Preface of his Commission and Authority. <hi>For
I say</hi> (says he) <hi>through the grace given unto me
to every man that is among you not to think of
himself more highly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62601:7"/>The Discourse which I design upon these
words shall be comprized within these limits.</p>
            <p>First, I observe that we are not at our own
liberty to entertain what Opinions we please
concerning our selves, but that we ought to
regulate them by some <hi>Standard.</hi> Which I col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
from the former part of the Text, <hi>Not to
think of himself more highly than he ought to think,
but to think soberly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I observe that the <hi>Standard</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are to regulate our Opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves are those excellencies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
which we are <hi>really</hi> indow'd with, which
I collect from the latter part of the Text, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as God has dealt to every man the measure
of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the third place I shall consider the
Absurdities and ill Consequences of transgressing
this <hi>Standard,</hi> whereby it shall appear how
highly reasonable this <hi>Admonition</hi> of the Apostle
is, and so conclude with a practical Application
of the whole in relation to our selves, and the
present occasion.</p>
            <p>I begin with the first Proposition, <hi>That we
are not at our own liberty to entertain what Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we please concerning our selves, but that we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62601:8"/>
ought to regulate them by some Standard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Acts of the <hi>understanding</hi> are by some men
thought as free from all <hi>Law</hi> as the Acts of
the <hi>will</hi> are from all <hi>necessity,</hi> and accordingly
they give every one a <hi>Toleration</hi> to <hi>abound in
his own sense</hi> and (provided his <hi>actions</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Rule) to <hi>think</hi> what he please.
Now since a Man cannot be accountable for
an <hi>Opinion</hi> of <hi>himself</hi> in particular, unless it be
first granted that he is under a Law as to the
Acts of his <hi>understanding</hi> in general, before I
can proceed any farther I find it necessary to
lay down this <hi>Preparatory</hi> Position, That we
are under an Obligation as to the Acts of our
understanding, or (which is all one) that we
are accountable for them. Nay I believe I
may venture higher and affirm that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
is not only under Obligation but
that 'tis the <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> Subject of
of it. For the proof of which Paradox, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the Patrons of the <hi>Intellectual Libertinism</hi>
to consider, that that must be the Primary
and immediate subject of all <hi>Obligation</hi> which
is so of <hi>Liberty.</hi> Now that this cannot be the
<hi>Will,</hi> I suppose will be acknowledged a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
if the Will necessarily follows the Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Dictate of the Understanding. And that
it does so, I think there is <hi>Demonstration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62601:8"/>'Tis an unquestionable Axiom in all the Schools
of Learning in the world, that the Object of the
Will is <hi>apparent</hi> good; Now apparent good in
other words, is that which is apprehended or
judg'd to be good, and if so, then it follows
that the Will cannot but conform to the Dictate
of the Understanding, because otherwise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might be the object of the Will that is
not apprehended good, which is contrary to
the supposition. In short, the Will (as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
has well expressed it) is the <hi>Conclusion</hi> of
an <hi>Operative Syllogism,</hi> and follows as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
from the <hi>Dictate</hi> of the Understanding as
as any other Conclusion does from its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and consequently cannot be the <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate</hi>
subject of Liberty, and consequently not
of Obligation.</p>
            <p>But then are we not involv'd in the same
difficulty as to the <hi>understanding?</hi> Does not
that act with equal (if not more) necessity
than the <hi>Will?</hi> So I know it is ordinarily
taught. But if this be absolutely and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
true, I must confess it above the reach
of my Capacity to salve the Notion of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or Religion, or to find out an expedient how
the <hi>Foundations</hi> of the <hi>Intellectual</hi> world should
not be <hi>out of course.</hi> For since 'tis evident both
from the preceding Demonstration, and from
experimental Reflection, that the Will necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62601:9"/>
acts in Conformity to the Dictates of the
Understanding, if those very Dictates are also
wholely and altogether neccssary, there can
be no such thing as a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the man is
bound hand and foot, has nothing left where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to render him a Moral Agent, to qualify
him for Law or Obligation, Vertue or Vice,
Reward or Punishment. But these are Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
not to be indured, and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
according to the Rules of right Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the <hi>Principle</hi> from which they flow to be
so too.</p>
            <p>To clear up then the whole Difficulty with
as much Brevity and Perspicuity as in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this intricacy is possible, I shall no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
consider the Understanding and Will as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
really distinct either from the Soul it
self, or from one another, but that the Soul
does immediately understand and will by it self,
without the intervention of any Faculty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
And that for this demonstrative reason
in short, because in the contrary Hypothesis,
either <hi>Iudgement</hi> must be ascribed to the Will,
and then the will immediately commences Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
or the Assent of the Will must be
blind, brutish, and accountable, both which are
as great Absurdities as they are true Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.
This being premised, I grant that
as the Soul necessarily Wills as she understands,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62601:9"/>
so likewise does she necessarily understand as
the Object appears. And thus far our sight
<hi>terminates</hi> in <hi>Fatality,</hi> and <hi>Necessity</hi> bounds our
<hi>Horizon.</hi> That then that must give us a <hi>Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi>
beyond it, must be this, that altho the
Soul necessarily understands or judges accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Appearance of things, yet that things
should so <hi>appear</hi> (unless it be in Propositions
that are self-evident, as that the whole is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than any one part, or the like) is not alike
necessary, but depends upon the degrees of
Advertency or Attention which the Soul uses,
and which to use either more or less is fully
and immediately in her own power. And this
indifferency of the Soul as to attending or not
attending I take to be the only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the
bottom and foundation into which the Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of every action must be at length resolv'd.
For a farther proof as well as Illustration of
which Hypothesis let us apply it to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
case and try how well it will answer
the <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> In the case then of <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
I look upon sin as an evil, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so but (while I attend fully to its Nature)
the greatest of evils. And as long as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
this Judgement 'tis utterly impossible I
should commit it, there being according to my
present apprehension no <hi>greater</hi> evil for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
of which I should think it eligible. But
now the evil of <hi>Pain</hi> being presented before
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62601:10"/>
me, and I not sufficiently attending to the evil
of Sin, this latter appears to be the lesser evil
of the two, and I accordingly <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi>
so pronounce it, and in Conformity to that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>necessarily</hi> chuse it. But because 'twas
absolutely in my power to have <hi>attended</hi> more
heedfully there was Liberty in the Principle,
the mistake which influenc'd the action was
vincible, and consequently the action it self
imputable. This <hi>Hypothesis</hi> however strange it
may seem to those that have sworn Faith and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
to the Dictates of the Schools, I believe
will be the more approv'd the more it is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
and that not only as rational and consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
in it self, but also as a refuge from those Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
which attend the ordinary Solutions.
Neither is this account wholely <hi>unlicens'd</hi> by
Authority, for I find some hints and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of it in the<note n="*" place="margin">See Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles upon the Golden Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras.</note> 
               <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> where the
reason why those middle sort of Beings call'd
Heroes are not so uniformly pure as the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is assign'd to be because they
do not so equally <hi>attend</hi> to the <hi>Beauty</hi> of the
<hi>Supream Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what has been said it appears plainly
that the Morality of every humane action must
be at length resolv'd into an immediate indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that the Soul has of <hi>attending</hi> or not <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,</hi>
and consequently that we are not only
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62601:10"/>
under Obligation as to the acts of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
but that all Obligation <hi>begins</hi> there.</p>
            <p>Having thus clear'd the way by the Proof
of this Preparatory Position, that we are under
Obligation as to the acts of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in general, I may now proceed to consider
that our opinion of our selves is <hi>one</hi> of those
acts of the Understanding which are subject
to Law, or in other terms, that <hi>we are not at
our own liberty to entertain what Opinions we please
concerning our selves, but that we ought to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
them by some Standard.</hi> Now the general
reason of this is, because 'tis of great moment
and influence in relation to our Practice, what
Opinion we entertain concerning our selves.
Indeed there are many acts of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which tho originally <hi>free,</hi> yet fall under
no Obligation by reason of the <hi>Indifferency</hi> of
the Matter, as in things of pure and naked
Speculation. These are the <hi>unforbidden</hi> Trees
of the Garden, and here we may let loose the
Reins and indulge our thoughts the full Scope.
Thus there is no danger of <hi>Heresy</hi> in asserting
or denying the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> nor is <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
whether the <hi>Moon</hi> be <hi>habitable.</hi> But
altho to mistake a Star be of no consequence
to the <hi>Theorist</hi> that sits immured in his Study,
yet it may be to the <hi>Pilot</hi> that is to <hi>Steer</hi> his
<hi>Course</hi> by it. There are <hi>other</hi> things which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62601:11"/>
have a <hi>practical</hi> Aspect, and here 'tis not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi>
what we <hi>think,</hi> because 'tis not <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi>
what we <hi>do.</hi> Now among these the
Opinion of our selves is to be reckon'd, as
having a great influence upon our well or ill
demeaning our selves respectively, as will more
minutely and particularly appear when we come
in the third and last place to consider the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
and ill consequences of trangressing
the <hi>Standard</hi> prescribed, and therefore I shall
defer the farther prosecution of it till then,
and in the mean while proceed to the second
<hi>Observable,</hi> Namely.</p>
            <p>That the Standard whereby we are to regulate
our Opinions concerning our selves, are those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
and perfections which we are really indow'd
with. <hi>Which is collected from these words,</hi>
according as God has dealt to every man the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Faith.</p>
            <p>In the former part of the Text there was
indeed a Restraint laid upon our Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our selves, but it was general only
and indefinite. But here the ground is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
out, and the Boundaries precisely set.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that's the great <hi>Ecliptic Line</hi> which
is to bound the Career of our most forward
and <hi>Self-indulging</hi> Opinions. If we keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this compass our motion is natural and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62601:11"/>
but if we slide never so little out of it, 'tis
unnatural and portentous. or to speak with
greater Simplicity, he that judges of himself
according to those excellencies, whether Moral
or Intellectual, which he really has, does <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>thinks soberly,</hi> and he that
thinks himself indow'd with any <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Degree</hi>
of Excellence which really he has not, does <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>thinks of himself more highly
than he ought to think.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then are Two things to be considered.</p>
            <p>First that we may proceed so <hi>far</hi> as this
<hi>Standard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Secondly, That we may not go <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond</hi>
it.</p>
            <p>First, That we may proceed so far.</p>
            <p>It has been taught by some of the severe
Masters of <hi>Spiritual Mortification,</hi> That we ought
to take up the most low and abject thoughts
of our selves that are possible, to be consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of no manner of excellency in our selves,
and consequently not to be affected with the
least <hi>Self-complacency;</hi> That we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
our selves to be Nothing, to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
to be worth nothing, but to be very
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62601:12"/>
               <hi>refuse and off-scouring of all things.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 13.</note> And this
they call the <hi>Mystical Death,</hi> or the <hi>Spiritual
Annihilation.</hi> Now whatever degrees of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
this may have (which I shall not now
dispute) 'tis most certain it can have nothing
of <hi>Duty.</hi> For tho it may, and oftentimes is
required of a man to think the <hi>Truth,</hi> yet he
can never be under an Obligation to be <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.</hi>
Besides, 'Tis hard to conceive how any
man (especially one that <hi>dwels</hi> much with
himself, and heedfully reflects upon the actings
of his own mind) should be master of any
considerable excellency, and yet not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
of it. And besides, That very degree
of Attention which is required that a man
should not think himself <hi>more</hi> accomplish'd
than indeed he is, will also infallibly hinder
him from thinking he is <hi>less.</hi> 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>Moses</hi> knew not that his Face shone, after
he had been conversing with God on the Mount.
He saw not the Orb of glory that stream'd
from him, and wondred what it was that
made him so dreadful to the people. But 'tis
not so with the Soul, whose reflexive faculty
will not fail to give her information of her
most retir'd and reserv'd accomplishments.
'Tis not with the <hi>Lesser,</hi> as with the <hi>Greater</hi>
World, where whole Tracts and Regions (and
those some of the best too) ly undiscover'd. No,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62601:12"/>
Man cannot be such a <hi>Stranger</hi> to his own
Perfections, such an <hi>America</hi> to himself. For
<hi>who can know the things of a man, if not the
Spirit of man which is in him.</hi> And accordingly
we find that the <hi>Ignorance</hi> of our selves with
which Mankind has been hitherto so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
tax'd, runs quite in another Chanel, and
does not consist in <hi>overlooking</hi> any of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
which we <hi>have,</hi> but in <hi>assuming</hi> to
our selves those which we <hi>have not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess (were it possible) I should think
it adviseable for some persons to be ignorant
of some of their excellencies, and like the Sun
not to <hi>reflect</hi> home to their own <hi>Sphere</hi> of <hi>light;</hi>
Not that I think in the least <hi>unlawful</hi> to be
fully conscious of ones own worth, but only
I consider that some men have not heads
strong enough to <hi>indure</hi> Heights, and walk up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Spires</hi> and <hi>Pinnacles.</hi> But if they can stand
there without growing <hi>vertiginous,</hi> they need
not question the lawfulness of the <hi>station,</hi> they
are still within the <hi>Region</hi> of <hi>Humility.</hi> For
'tis not every thinking well of ones self that
falls in with the notion of <hi>Pride,</hi> but only
when there is more of <hi>Opinion</hi> than there is
of <hi>Worth.</hi> 'Twas this that was the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Apostate Angel, not that he took
a just complacency in the eminency of his
Station, but that he vainly arrogated to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
what was not his <hi>due,</hi> in that he said, <hi>I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62601:13"/>
will ascend into Heaven, I will exalt my throne
above the Stars of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 14. 13.</note> 
               <hi>I will sit upon the sides
of the North, I will ascend above the heights of
the Clouds, I will be like the most High.</hi> 'Twas
for this that the Angel of <hi>Death</hi> drew upon
<hi>Herod,</hi> not because he was pleas'd with the
<hi>fineness</hi> and <hi>success</hi> of his Oratory, but because
he was not so <hi>just</hi> to <hi>God</hi> as the People were
to <hi>him,</hi> but lookt upon himself as the <hi>Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fountain</hi>
of his own perfections, and so <hi>gave
not God</hi> the <hi>glory.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 12. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But now if we take care to proportion our esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<hi>of,</hi> and our Complacencies <hi>in</hi> our selves to
the measure of our endowments, and if we look
upon those very endowments not as <hi>originary</hi> and
independent but as <hi>derivative</hi> from the <hi>Father</hi> of
<hi>lights from whom every good and perfect gift descends,</hi>
               <note place="margin">James 1. 17.</note>
and accordingly refer all to Gods glory and with
the Elders in the Revelations take off our
Crowns from our Heads and cast them at the foot
of the Throne,<note place="margin">Rev. 4. 10.</note> we have not only the express
words of the Text, but likewise all the reason
in the world to warrant the <hi>Sobriety</hi> of our
Opinions. For, this is but to have a right and
exact understanding of ones self. And why may
not a man be allow'd to take a true Estimate
of himself as well as of another man? Or
why should a man think an excellency less
valuable because 'tis in himself? The Happiness
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62601:13"/>
of God consists in seeing himself <hi>as he is;</hi> he
reflects upon the <hi>Beauty</hi> of his Essence, and
rejoyces with an infinite <hi>Complacency.</hi> Now
certainly that wherein consists the <hi>Happiness</hi> of
the <hi>Creator,</hi> cannot be a <hi>Sin</hi> in the <hi>Creature.</hi>
Besides, I would fain know why a man may
not as lawfully think well of himself upon the
Score of his real worth, as <hi>desire</hi> that <hi>others</hi>
should think well of him for the same reason?
And that he may do the latter is confess'd as
well by the <hi>Practice,</hi> as by the common <hi>Suffrage</hi>
of Mankind. For otherwise what becomes of
that <hi>good Reputation</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> says <hi>is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be chosen than great Riches,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 1</note> and of which
the Best and Wisest men of all ages had ever
such a tender, such a passionate Regard? Nay
'tis look't upon as a very <hi>Commendable</hi> thing
to be so affected, and the contrary is censured
as the mark of a dissolute and <hi>unmoraliz'd</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
Only there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in this as well as in the former,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 13.</note> and as
we are not to <hi>stretch out our selves beyond our

               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 14.</note> so must we take care with the great

Oratory, before he <hi>can give God the Glory.</hi>
Again in the last place, if a man may not
have leave to take Cognisance of his own
Deserts and to value himself accordingly, what
will become of that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Which the Apostle speaks of, <hi>the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
of a good Conscience towards God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 21.</note> which is
nothing else but a Sentence of Approbation,
which a man passes upon himself for the well
managing of that <hi>Talent</hi> of Liberty which God
has entrusted him with? Now this is the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
of Vertue, and therefore certainly not
<hi>contrary</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>Neither is this <hi>Self-esteem</hi> only the <hi>Reward</hi>
of Vertue but also the <hi>Cause</hi> of it too, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
'tis not only <hi>allowable,</hi> but also highly
<hi>needful</hi> that we should think <hi>Honorably</hi> of our
selves. 'Tis a frequent Observation among
<hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Divine.</hi> Writers, That most if not all
the Sins which men commit, proceed from want
of a due sense of the Dignity of their Nature.
And consequently a due reflection upon a man's
own Worth, must needs be a strong <hi>Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
against whatsoever would <hi>stain</hi> its <hi>Glory,
Shall such a man as I flee?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Neh. 6. 11.</note> Was the powerful
consideration that <hi>buoy'd</hi> up the <hi>sinking</hi> Spirits
of <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> And 'tis one of the <hi>Capital</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of <hi>Pythagoras</hi>'s Morals (and perhaps one
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62601:14"/>
of the best too that was ever given to the
World)—<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Above
all things reverence thy self.</hi> And 'twas the
Saying of another of the Sons of Wisdom, <hi>Let
not the Reverence of any man cause thee to sin.</hi>
Which it certainly will do, unless we observe
the former Rule, and reflect with due <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
upon our own Worth and Dignity.</p>
            <p>From these considerations (not to urge any
more) it seems to me very evident, that 'tis
not only <hi>lawful</hi> but in some respects highly
<hi>Expedient,</hi> that our Opinions of our selves should
rise up so as to be of a <hi>Level</hi> with our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
whatsoever they are. Let one of
the Scales be mounted never so <hi>high,</hi> yet if
there be a proportionable <hi>Weight</hi> in the <hi>Other,</hi>
the Ballance moves regularly, and as it should
do. We may then proceed so <hi>far</hi> as this
<hi>Standard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Secondly, We must not go <hi>beyond</hi> it. For
all beyond this is <hi>Pride.</hi> Pride, that turn'd the
Angels out of Heaven, <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradice,
and levell'd the great King of <hi>Babylon</hi> with
the <hi>Beasts that perish;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 4. 33.</note> and which is nothing
else but an <hi>Intemperate</hi> Opinion of our selves,
which consists either in assuming to our selves
any Excellency which we have not, or in <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating</hi>
what we have. Tho indeed in <hi>Strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:62601:15"/>
of Notion this latter falls in with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
For to <hi>Over-rate</hi> what we have, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to assume some <hi>Degree</hi> of good which
we have not. Here then begins our Restraint,
the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of which will appear from
the Absurdities and ill Consequences which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the transgressing of this <hi>Standard,</hi> and
which in the third and last place I come now to
consider.</p>
            <p>I shall observe only the most notorious; and
these I shall reduce to these Three general
Heads.</p>
            <p>First, That it unqualifies us for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of many Duties.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it betrayes us into many sins.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly, That it frustrates all methods
of Reformation. Of these very briefly.</p>
            <p>First an excessive opinion of our selves (and
that is so which surpasses the measure of our
real worth) unqualifies us for the performance
of many Duties; and that both in relation to
God, our Neighbour and our Selves.</p>
            <p>First in relation to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:62601:15"/>As <hi>Folly</hi> leads to <hi>Atheism,</hi> so does an <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening</hi>
opinion of our own <hi>Wisdom</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
excellency to <hi>Profaneness.</hi> For as <hi>the Fool
has said in his heart there is no God,</hi> so it is
said in another place That the <hi>ungodly is so
Proud that he careth not for him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 10. 4.</note> Pride then is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
inconsistent with that Subjection, Honour
and Veneration which we owe to God. For
how can he submit his passions to the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
of the <hi>Divine Will</hi> who has made a <hi>Law</hi>
of his <hi>own?</hi> And as it indisposes us for all <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi>
so likewise for all <hi>passive</hi> Obedience; for
how can he <hi>suffer</hi> that with <hi>Patience,</hi> which
he thinks he does not <hi>deserve</hi> in <hi>Iustice?</hi> Or
how can he submit with <hi>resignation</hi> to the seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unevenesses of Providential Dispensations,
the equality of which because he cannot <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern,</hi>
he must in <hi>honour</hi> to his own understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>deny?</hi> And upon the same ground it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualifies
us for <hi>Faith</hi> in many of the Divine
Revelations. For how can he <hi>Captivate</hi> his
understanding to <hi>Mysteries,</hi> who thinks it a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to <hi>own</hi> any, and is resolv'd to <hi>believe</hi>
no farther than he can <hi>comprehend?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, It unqualfies us for <hi>Gratitude</hi> towards
God, and consequently puts a Bar to all those
good actions which we would otherwise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
upon that <hi>Principle.</hi> And by this it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a <hi>Multiplied,</hi> a <hi>Legion</hi> evil. For how can
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62601:16"/>
he acknowledge an Obligation pass'd upon him
by Gods <hi>Favours,</hi> who calls them not by that
name; but esteems them as <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and inverting the Protestation of the
good <hi>Patriarch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 10.</note> thinks himself <hi>worthy</hi> of the
<hi>greatest</hi> of his <hi>mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Secondly, In relation to our Neighbour,
it unqualifies us for Obedience to Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
For how can he submit to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of his Superiours, and pay an <hi>implicite</hi>
deference to the <hi>Occult</hi> reasons of State, who
thinks himself wiser than a whole <hi>Senate,</hi> and
disputes even the ways of <hi>Providence?</hi> Pride
was ever observed to be the Mother of Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Rebellion, and accordingly St. <hi>Iude</hi>
makes it part of the <hi>Character</hi> of the Proud
<hi>Gnostics, To despise Dominions and speak evil of
Dignities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, It unqualifies us for those acts of
Justice which consist in a due observation of
our Neighbours Merits, and a deference of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Respect proportionable to that observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For how can he be at <hi>leasure</hi> to take
notice of <hi>anothers</hi> worth, who is so wholely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up in the <hi>contemplation</hi> of his <hi>own?</hi> Let the
Reputation of his best Friends (if it be possible
for a Proud man to have any) be in never so
great danger, he like <hi>Archimedes,</hi> is so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busie
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62601:16"/>
in admiring the Creatures of his own brain,
those <hi>Draughts</hi> and <hi>Ideas</hi> which he has form'd
of <hi>himself</hi> there, that he regards not the <hi>Ruin</hi> that
is about him. Or if he does, he is so far from
appearing in their defence (as in Justice he
ought) that he rather rejoyces at their <hi>Spots</hi> as
<hi>Accessions</hi> to his own <hi>brightness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, It unqualifies us for the Offices of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
and Civil Behaviour, and all kinds of
<hi>Homilitical</hi> virtue: for how can he treat those
with any tolerable Civility, whom he looks
down upon as a whole <hi>Species</hi> below him?</p>
            <p>Lastly, it unqualifies us for Gratitude toward
our Benefactors. For how can he think himself
obliged by <hi>man,</hi> who counts <hi>God</hi> his <hi>Debtor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then Thirdly, In relation to our Selves, here
is this grand ill consequence of an immoderate
salf-esteem, that it unqualifies us not only for
higher attainments, but even for the very <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi>
of improvement, and so cuts short and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwarfs</hi>
all our excellencies. 'Tis the Observarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Cicero, Multi ad scientiam pervenissent nisi se
jam pervenisse credidissent,</hi> The <hi>Opinion</hi> of the
Proud man has so far got the <hi>start</hi> of the real
<hi>worth,</hi> that the <hi>latter</hi> will never <hi>overtake</hi> the
<hi>former.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the immoderate esteem of our Selves
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62601:17"/>
unqualifies us for the performance of many Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
so does it also in the Second place Betray us
into many Sins.</p>
            <p>First, Into all those sins which are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the foremention'd Vertues respectively.
And besides them into many more, such as are
presumption and security, vexation and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
contempt of others (tho at the same time
it exposes us to theirs) Anger and Contention,
Malice and Revenge. For the Proud man is not
content to be his own <hi>private</hi> Admirer, but
quarels with all others that are not of his
perswasi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, and with the <hi>Tyrant</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi>
kindles a <hi>fire</hi> for those who will not <hi>fall down
and worship the Image which he has set up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither does the <hi>Leprosy</hi> stop here. But as it
betrays us into many sins, so in the Third and
last place (which is the most dismal Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of all) It frustrates all Methods of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
Gods judgements will but exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and inrage him, because he thinks he does
<hi>not</hi> deserve them, and his Mercies will not
indear him, because he thinks he <hi>does. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>
he thinks he does not <hi>need</hi> and <hi>Reproof</hi>
he cannot <hi>bear.</hi> Besides he thinks so well of
himself already, that he wonders what you <hi>mean</hi>
by advising him to become <hi>better,</hi> and therefore
as he does not endeavour after any of those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62601:17"/>
which he thinks he has, so neither can
he dream of mending those faults which he
thinks he is not guilty of: Thus is the man <hi>Seal'd</hi>
up to iniquity, and deeply <hi>lodg'd</hi> in the <hi>strong holds</hi>
of sin, where nothing that has a Salutary Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can come nigh him. And in this he resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the first <hi>Presidents</hi> of his Folly, who from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
transform'd themselves into Devils, and fell
beyond the <hi>possibilities</hi> of <hi>recovery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are some of the fruits of this <hi>Root of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness,</hi>
and tho more might be named, yet these I
think sufficient to justify this Admonition of the
<hi>Apostle</hi> to every man, <hi>not to think of himself more
highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as God has dealt to every man the measure of
faith.</hi> Let us then all endeavour to conform our
opinions concerning our selves to this <hi>Standard.</hi>
Let us not stretch our selves beyond our <hi>natural
dimensions,</hi> but learn to entertain modest and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thoughts of our own excellencies and indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and mortify our <hi>understands</hi> as well as our
<hi>sensitive affections.</hi> And thus shall we <hi>compleat</hi> our
<hi>Lent</hi> Exercise by joyning the mortification of the
<hi>Spirit</hi> to that of the <hi>flesh,</hi> without which the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Austerities wherewith we can afflict the <hi>latter,</hi>
will not be <hi>such a Fast as God has chosen.</hi> For what
will it avail to macerate the Body, while the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
part the Soul remains unmortify'd? The <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi>
of Moses must conspire with his Forty days
<hi>Fasting</hi> to qualify a man for Divine Intercourses,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62601:18"/>
to make him the Joy of Angels, the <hi>Friend of God.</hi>
Thus then let us accomplish the <hi>Refinings</hi> of our
Souls, and fill up the <hi>Measure</hi> of our Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
To which end let us add this one further
Consideration to what has been already said, that
Humility in the Judgement even of the <hi>High and
Lofty one thats inhabits Eternity,</hi> is a Vertue of such
great Excellency, and singular advantage to the
happiness of Mankind, that our Blessed Saviour
came down from Heaven to teach it, that his
whole life was one continu'd Exercise of it, and
that he has dignify'd it with the <hi>first</hi> place among
his <hi>Beatitudes.</hi> Let us then as many as profess the
Religion of the Humble and Crucify'd JESUS
make it our strict Care that we neglect not this
his <hi>great</hi> Commandment, nor omit to Copy out
this Principal Line, this main-stroke of the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
he has set us. Especially let us of this place
who are set among the <hi>greater Lights</hi> of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
and whose profession and business is to
contemplate <hi>Truth</hi> and to think of things as God
made them in <hi>Number, Weight</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in the <hi>first</hi> place to take just and true Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of our <hi>Selves,</hi> that our <hi>Knowledge puff us</hi> not
<hi>up,</hi> nor our <hi>Height</hi> become our <hi>Ruin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to the only Wise God, Father, Son and Holy
Ghost be all Adoration and Thanksgiving now and
for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
