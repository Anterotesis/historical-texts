            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="7">7.

               <p n="8">8. Mr. <hi>Hetherington,</hi> How came you and Mr. <hi>Morphy</hi> ſo great? did you declare, that Mr. <hi>Morphy</hi> endeavoured to ſuborn Witneſſes to ſwear that Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Baker</hi> were Confederates with the Tories in <hi>

                  <note place="margin">Very little, but borrowed, but forgot the mans name.</note> 9. Mr. <hi>Hetherington,</hi> What Money did you bring with you into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and how much? was it in Caſh, or by Bill of Exchange? if by Bill, who drew it? and upon whom in <hi>London?</hi> name the parties.</p>
               <p>Now Sir, you have an account of Mr. <hi>Hetherington</hi>'s life and converſation, the principal manager of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Evidence, as he ſtiles himſelf. I will now go on and prove, that inſtead of doing his Majesty ſervice, or rightly managing the Evidence, he endeavoured to render his Majesty odious to his people in <hi>London,</hi> and to perſwade them that the Popiſh Subjects of <note place="margin">Stood up to juſtifie the Bull or Brief, but at laſt was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</note>
                  <hi>Ireland,</hi> were diſcharged from their Allegiance by the Pope. And that he ſhewed the Popes Bulls, or Briefs to that purpoſe, to his Majesty, and that his Majesty took no notice thereof; that he concluded therefore his Majesty was actually in the Plot, or a Favourer of it: And that the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> called him Rogue and Raſcal for producing thoſe Bulls. All theſe things he endeavoursd to inſinuate into the hearts and minds of the people here, to do the King harm, and to breed confuſion and miſchief.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Let Mr. <hi>Hetherington</hi> declare if he e're received any ſuch Bulls or Briefs, where they are now, who gave them to him, and to whom did he deliver them?</p>
               <p>But let the Reader obſerve, that when <hi>Hetherington</hi> found himſelf to be Impeached, he popp'd in the enſuing Charge againſt Mr. <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> though he could neither juſtifie nor prove any or either of the ten Articles, which defeated his malice.</p>

And further ſaith, That it was impoſſible for him to commend the ſaid <hi>Fustace Comyns,</hi> as in truth he did not, he having little or no acquaintance with him; only ſeeing him ſometimes Threſhing and Ditching for Mr. <hi>Manus O Brian,</hi> this Reſpondent's Neighbour in the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and knowing that he was a Fellow not above the quality of a daily Labourer, who commonly wrought for 4 <hi>d. per diem</hi> in that Country, and hearing by credible perſons that he was eſteemed a Rogue, and threatned to burn the ſaid <hi>Manus O Brian</hi>'s Houſe, and ſtole out of <hi>Limerick</hi> Gaol, as Mr. <hi>Hetherington</hi> did out of the Black-Dog Priſon in <hi>Dublin;</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Eustace Comyns</hi> being of no other quality or reputation as aforeſaid, (as the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Limerick,</hi> Sir <hi>William King</hi> Governour of <hi>Limerick,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Croker</hi> and others can teſtifie) it was unreaſonable that this Reſpondent ſhould think (as he never did) that the ſaid <hi>Euſtace Comyns</hi> could charge the greateſt Men, or Man in <hi>Ireland</hi> with any Plot, any more then he thinks, it was otherwiſe then wicked in Mr. <hi>Hetherington</hi> to bring over honeſt men from their Habitations in <hi>Carrick</hi> and <hi>Clonmell,</hi> thinking to bribe them groundleſly to accuſe ſome of your Majeſties Loyal Subjects, thereby to affirm and countenance the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of the ſaid <hi>Hetheringtrn</hi> and others.</p>

               <p n="2">2. This Reſpondent abſolutely denieth the charge of the ſecond Article; only that he told the Earl of <hi>Burlington,</hi> that the Lord <hi>Brittas</hi> and Biſhop

                  <hi>3.</hi> That notwithſtanding the ſaid <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> hath ſince endeavoured by many ways and means, to bring this Informant and the ſaid Witneſſes into his Majeſties diſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>favour, and to cast reproaches upon them, the better to invalidate their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; alledging untruly, that they had received Three thouſand pounds from the City of <hi>London,</hi> or ſome of the Citizens thereof, or ſome others, whom he would mention if he could.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the third Article this Reſpondent ſaith, That he believes that neither the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> or <hi>Comyns</hi> ever were in your Majeſties, or any good mans favour, and therefore to endeavour or take the leaſt pains to bring them and their Witneſſes into your Majeſties diſ-favour, or to caſt Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upon them, is needleſs, the Character enſtamped upon them already by Oral Teſtimony, and matter of Record, ſufficiently evidencing their demerits: He confeſſeth he ſaid that he heard, and doth verily believe that Three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds have been collected from ſome of the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and that part thereof was paid to Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and other part thereof to the ſaid <hi>Hetherington,</hi> where, (in breach of his Truſt) paid but little or nothing of it to the Witneſſes.</p>

That the ſaid <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> when he knew the ſaid Witneſſes were to be called into either Houſes of Parliament, or ſome Committee relating to them, to give in their Evidence, hath endeavoured to hide them, or ſome of them, that they could not be found; and when they have been found, he hath laid violent hands on them, or ſome of them, and would not permit them to go, until they forced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves away from him; and then he threatned them, and thoſe that called them, and with an Oath ſaid he would break <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Knot; and the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the Witneſſes, acknowledged he had received for his ſervice One hundred pounds of his Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Five hundred pounds from the King, and a Commiſſion to be a Captain; and that his Majeſty had given him two blank Patents for Baronets, the one for his Father-in-Law, and the other to be at his own diſpoſing; and alſo a Grant of the Commons of <hi>Rakeale,</hi> and all the Commons of <hi>Knock-Greary,</hi> in the County of <hi>Limerick.</hi>

He confeſſes he ſaid he would break <hi>Hetherington</hi>'s Knot, but denies he ever mentioned the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> to that purpoſe: He confeſſeth he received One hundred pounds of your Majeſties money out of your Treaſury in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by order of the Lord Lieutenant and Councel there, and not a peny of the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi>'s own money, as is maliciouſly ſuggeſted; and he received alſo One hundred pounds <hi>ſterling</hi> more out of your Majeſties Treaſury in <hi>England,</hi> by your Majeſties order in Councel, and no more, which is all the Reſpondent ever received to defray the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary great charges expended by him in ſeveral Journeys in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and his Voyage from thence to this place, in proſecution of his Diſcovery, being far ſhort of the real ſums laid out by him purely on the account aforeſaid, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpent ſeventeen months entirely in that Service, wholly neglecting his own private concerns. He confeſſeth, that he was deſired by ſome of his Friends and Relations, to procure (if he could) two blank Patents for Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in <hi>Ireland,</hi> from your Majeſty; denies that ever he ſaid he had a Grant of the Commons in the ſaid Article mentioned, but confeſſeth that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to apply for the ſame, being parcel of his ancient Eſtate, and would have raiſed a conſiderable ſum of Money for the procuring thereof, if it could be obtained; and as to all and every other matter and thing in the ſaid fourth Article contained, this Reſpondent denieth the ſame.</p>

That the ſaid <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> hath not only vilified and abuſed him this Informant, and the Evidence which he was concerned for, but alſo Mr. <hi>Thomas Samſon,</hi> who came over upon his own accord to ſerve his Majeſty in that matter, who by his Teſtimony therein hath given great ſatisfaction to both Houſes of Parliament.</p>

He alſo ſaith, that he declared at the Bar of the Lords Houſe, that by flying report he heard that Col. <hi>John Fitz-Patrick,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Scot</hi> were concerned in the Plot; but how far they were concerned therein, this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent did not, nor doth not charge them with of his own knowledge: He denieth to have altered his mind, or to deviate from Truth or Juſtice; and hopes that God will not leave him, after the example of <hi>Hetherington</hi> and others, to follow evil ways, and promote wicked deſigns, upon any temptation whatſoever: And therefore he doth not underſtand <hi>Hetherington</hi>'s meaning, who ſaith that the Reſpondent's mind is ſince altered, upon what conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be well judged, the ſame being abſolutely falſe, and ſcandalouſly inſinuated.

                  </gap>urther to Impeach the ſaid <hi>William Hetherington,</hi> doth now moſt humbly ſay and propoſe, That the ſaid <hi>William Hetherington,</hi> having broken Priſon in <hi>Dublin,</hi> correſponded with <hi>Hanlan,</hi> and the reſt of the Outlaws and Tories in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and having defrauded and cheated many of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties good Subjects in that Kingdom, repaired into <hi>England,</hi> and untruly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſome of his Majeſties good Subjects here, to gain himſelf reputation and credit in <hi>England,</hi> that he was ſometimes a Juſtice of the Peace in ſome County in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had a conſiderable Eſtate there, though he had but eighteen pence in his Pocket when he came to <hi>London,</hi> and all his Apparel was not worth half a Crown; procured himſelf (but by what, or whoſe means or Authority, this Proponent doth not yet know) to be ſtiled, <hi>the Manager of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Evidence,</hi> thereby to have the opportunity to relieve his diſtreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though by the ſhipwrack of his Conſcience, and utter ruine of his Soul; and alſo by ſuborning Witneſſes to accuſe Perſons of the higheſt Quality, next and under his Majeſty, of Treaſon, and to accuſe others of the like crime, thereby inſtead of ſerving his Majeſty, according to the duty of his pretended Office, to diſturb his Majeſties happy reign over his Subjects, and the peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of his Kingdoms.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the ſaid <hi>Hetherington,</hi> the better to effect his ſaid wicked deſigns, got into his hands One hundred pounds of his Majeſties money, to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Witneſſes, who were all needy, and miſerably poor, which ſum he converted to his own uſe, but Ten pounds only he diſtributed amongſt four Prieſts, and others of the Witneſſes; and hath alſo received di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſums collected in the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Witneſſes, wherein he hath not juſtly diſcharged his Truſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> laboured all ways and means he could, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Majeſties Royal Perſon and Government odious, as well to his Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> as of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to induce them to a belief, that his Majeſty is a favourer of Papiſts and Popery, thereby to ſtir up the people to Rebellion, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> for he the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> did divers times, in open Companies and places in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and elſewhere, publiſh and declare in the hearing of his Majeſties Subjects, that he brought with him out of <hi>Ireland</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> a Bull or Brief under the Seal of the Pope, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> diſcharging his Majeſties Popiſh Subjects of <hi>Ireland</hi> from their Natural Allegiance to his Majeſty; And that he himſelf in perſon, did ſhew and produce the aforeſaid Bull or Brief to his Majeſty, and acquainted his Majeſty with the tenour thereof; and that his Majeſty took no notice of it, but in and towards the favouring and countenancing of Papiſts, and for the introducing of Popery, did reject the ſame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the ſaid <hi>Hetherington,</hi> intending to bring the Queens Majeſty, and his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> into the hatred of his Majeſty and of all his Subjects, and to deprive them of their Lives, Eſtates, and Royal Dignities, and alſo intending to weaken his Majeſties Intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and draw away the affections of his Subjects there from him, hath by entreaties and other ways of perſwaſion, endeavoured to ſuborn Witneſſes to ſwear, that the Queens Majeſty, his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> as alſo that the Lord Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others his Majeſties
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105932:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
loyal and faithful Subjects, were privy to, and principally concerned in the Plots both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt his Majeſties Perſon and Government.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the ſaid <hi>Hetherington,</hi> the better to compaſs the enterprizes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and to ſtrengthen his proof againſt her Sacred Majeſty, his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and others as aforeſaid, as alſo to anticipate the ſaid Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland,</hi> his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to reduce <hi>Hanlan,</hi> and the reſt of the Tories in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to their due obedience, hath for ſome time paſt held, and ſtill doth hold, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate correſpondence with the ſaid <hi>Hanlan,</hi> and other Outlaws and Tories in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though many of them are guilty of Murthers, and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed or proclaimed Rebels, according to the courſe of the Laws there: And did by his Letters invite the ſaid <hi>Hanlan</hi> and his Confederates, to give out in ſpeeches, that he and his Confederates were privy to the Plot in <hi>Ireland</hi> againſt his Majeſty, and that he and they could prove that her Majeſty, his Royal Highneſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and the Lord Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were principally concerned therein, ſo as ſuch Declaration might be made publick here in <hi>England:</hi> That then if <hi>Hanlan</hi> would but ſend him the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> a competent ſum of money, and would really ſwear (though falſly) againſt the Queen, his Highneſs, and the reſt, he would under pretence of ſuch his diſcovery of the Plot, and giving Evidence as aforeſaid, obtain his Majeſties Pardon for the ſaid <hi>Hanlan</hi> and his Confederates, for all Treaſons, Murthers, Felonies, and all other offences whatſoever; thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending no good to his Majeſty and People, but confuſion and trouble, and to put a piece of <hi>Hanlan</hi>'s money into his own Pocket, and to ſuborn the ſaid Miſcreants to ſwear as he ſhould dictate to them, hoping to better his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the ruine of his Majeſties good Subjects, that he projected would enſue thereupon.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That he pretended to have a great many ſubſtantial and credible Witneſſes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to prove the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plot, whoſe Names he could not then remember, as he alledged, and therefore obtained a blank Warrant from his Majeſty, to fetch over the ſaid Witneſſes into <hi>England:</hi> That under colour thereof, he hath by his Emiſſaries there cauſed ſeveral Gentlemen, as well Papiſts as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and Juſtices of the Peace in many Counties, Towns, and places in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to be Impriſoned, forced other ignorant men to pay monies for not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling or moleſting them, and at length brought over into <hi>England</hi> (amongſt others) ſix honeſt perſons, Inhabitants of <hi>Carrick</hi> and <hi>Clonmell,</hi> as Witneſſes, and on their arrival in <hi>London,</hi> imployed one <hi>Euſtace Comyns</hi> to perſwade them to ſwear againſt their knowledge, in Affirmance and Juſtification of what <hi>Comyns</hi> had already untruly ſworn; And this he did purpoſely to abuſe his Majeſties Warrant and Royal Authority, to put his Majeſty to great charges, to amuſe the Vulgar, to hinder the ſaid perſons in their own private concerns, becauſe they would give his Emiſſaries no monies, to diſcourage Trade and Dealing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to create an univerſal diſquiet, and terrible apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the hearts and minds of his Majeſties Subjects there, of imminent and ſudden dangers and calamities, the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> thereby labouring and wickedly deſigning to bring an <hi>odium</hi> and ſcandal upon his Majeſty, and his Royal Government.</p>
               <p>All which Articles the ſaid <hi>David Fitz-Gerald</hi> is ready to aver and prove, as his Majesty and this moſt Honourable Board ſhall award: And humbly prayeth, that the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> may be committed, or ſo ſecured, as that he may be compelled to Anſwer the ſame: For that the ſaid <hi>David Fitz-Gerald</hi> hath good reaſons to believe, that the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> will not abide a Hearing in this cauſe, but will make his Eſcape with Impunity, to the Encouragement of ill men, and in contempt of his Majesty and this Honourable Board; wherein the ſaid <hi>David Fitz-Gerald</hi> humbly ſubmitteth to his Majeſty, and your Lordſhips great wiſdom and direction.</p>
