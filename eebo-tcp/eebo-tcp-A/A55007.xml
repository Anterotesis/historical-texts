            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE<note place="margin">Div. S.</note> READER.</head>
            <p>THE History of <hi>Platina</hi> of the Lives of the Popes, being rendred into English by an unknown hand, was delivered to me by the Bookseller; and considering that <hi>Platina</hi> was an Author of good Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Authority in the World, I often wished that he had lived in that Age, in which he might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his History from ancient to the present times; or that some other of our learned men would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the same in the Language of our own Country; for since our Tongue is so well refined, and so copious, it ought justly to comprehend all those Histories, Sciences and Arts, which are related and made known in forreign Languages. But observing that this Work was neglected, and not thought worthy the labour of better Pens, I essayed to do it in my own rude and plain Style, without affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ornament, more than what the simplicity of naked truth would afford me; in search of which I have always had recourse to the best and to the most impartial Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who have neither disguised the Vices of Men by flattery, nor out of prejudice branded those Actions with shame and obloquy, which might have admitted of a fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er character. Nor have I mixed any thing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in this History, but where the nature of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation could not subsist without it: for in regard the Court, and not the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is the subject on which I treat, I have made the Points of Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental only to the following Discourses.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:50681:4"/>
            <p>But as to <hi>Platina</hi> himself, <hi>Trithemius</hi> in his Treatise of Ecclesiastical Writers gives him this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>He was born (sayes he) at <hi>Cremona,</hi> was Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary to the Pope, and a man learned in all Sciences, he was an excellent Philosopher, and a famous Orator, of an acute and ready wit, and perswasive eloquence; he was couragious, and so constant to his principles, that under Pope <hi>Paul</hi> II. he was deprived of his Estate and Preferments, and after having endured the wrack or torture, he was cruelly cast into Prison, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained during the Reign of this <hi>Paul</hi> II. afterwards he was set at liberty by <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. to whom he dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated this following History of the Popes. He died at <hi>Rome</hi> of the Plague, Aged 60 years, A. D. 1481. <hi>Frederick</hi> III. being Emperour, and <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pope.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:50681:4"/>
            <head>AN INTRODUCTION To the following HISTORY.</head>
            <p>THIS continuation of <hi>Plaetina,</hi> (the subject of which is the Lives and Reigns of the Popes,) is a Treatise purely historical, collected from feveral <hi>Latin, French,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Authors: whose design being solely to transmit matter of Fact to posterity, did not intermeddle with points of Religion, but as they accidentally occurred in the connexion of History, there being a vast difference between the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this latter Notion, which consists of a Pope, who is Sovereign and of seventy Cardinals, or more; who are his Counsellours, besides a great number of Prelats, we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine our Discourse. And whereas the Pope is a Prince, who hath a Temporal Dominion under his Government, and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; it is no wonder if he, and the Creatures, and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents who attend him in all his Counsels, should act by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes purely civil, and political: whence it is, that Popes are approached with so much more awe, and profound Reverence, than is performed towards Kings and Emperours, because the Spiritual comes in to maintain and uphold the Authority of the Temporal, and both being united do mutually support each other: hence proceed all the flatteries used in that Court, all the contrivances which Ambition can suggest to raise Families, and make those great who are in Authority. And in short, nothing is omitted, which the Wit of Man, and the Artifices of the most refined Heads in the World, (such as those are at <hi>Rome</hi>) can devise to conserve, and exalt the Interest and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Court.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:50681:5"/>
            <p>The Original of this Jurisdiction, which is encreased to such<note place="margin">The Original of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> a degree of Power and Greatness, as is become suspected by Kings, and formidable to its people, sprang at first from those words of our Saviour to his Apostles, <hi>Whose sins ye shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give on Earth shall be forgiven in Heaven, and whose sins ye shall bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven:</hi> the which large and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive priviledg was attended with a Commission to feed Christs Flock, to preach the Gospel, and to administer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and with an exhortation to all the faithful to love one the other, and to pardon, and forgive each other their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. The Primitive Church which was always zealous to reconcile the Brethren, and procure pardon of the Offender from the person offended, did ordain according to the Epistle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that the Saints, or Christians<note place="margin">1 Cor. cap. 6.</note> should not maintain a process of Law one against the other at the Bar, or Tribunals of Infidels, but that they should rather appoint, and constitute some of the Faithful who were Men of approved wisdom, and integrity, to hear, and examine, and determine all their differences. This manner of trial was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly submitted unto with great charity of the both parties, and with an unbiassed sentence of the Judg; for the first had no power over them to enforce execution, unless the constraint of their own Consciences, which bore witness that the adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was from God; Nor did the Ecclesiastical Judg pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce sentence without regret, sorrow, and grief for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, as appears by the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 2. where the sorrow of the Offender is said to be so great as to require comfort; and that the Judg also did partake in the like affliction and anguish of heart with him.</p>
            <p>This dispensation of the Ecclesiastical Cenſures, being a work of great Charity, was an Office onely proper for such as had attained to a good esteem for piety, and to the degree and dignity of a Bishop. But as the Faithful encreaſed, and the Churches became numerous, so the deliberations on Causes were too heavy, and burdensom for the Bishop alone; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though the Bills, and Processes at Law were received by the hands of the Bishop, they were yet afterwards transferred to the consideration of the Ancients, who were called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which being digested by them, received their ultimate determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and sentence from the General Assembly of the Church: the which practice was in use in the year of our Lord 250. as
<pb facs="tcp:50681:5"/>
appears by the Epistles of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> wherein he writes to the Presbyters of his Diocese of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that he intended not to act in any thing without the counsel and advice of them, and consent of the people, and that he would examine the Causes, and the merits thereof in their presence: and moreover he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves certain Priests for their irregular proceedings in cases of judgment, threatning to give an account thereof unto the people. This charity, and plain dealings of the Bishops gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them such reputation, that their advice, and sentence was almost in all matters followed, and admitted by the people, whose charity in after-Ages growing cold, and careless of the mutual good and benefit each of other, came by degrees to cast off this burdensom Office of Judgment, and to remit it solely to the Incumbence of the Bishop, who also degenerating from the primitive humility, easily gave way to the allurements of ambition, and under the disguise of Charity, and Vertue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Authority of passing sentence without the assistance, or consultation with co-ordinate Judges. So soon as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions ceased great loads of business, Cases, and Trials at Law devolved upon the Bishop, so that then he was forced to erect a Tribunal of Justice, and contrive Methods, and rules for Judicial proceedings: howsoever in those times of simplicity and innocence, things were not so wholly corrupted, but that though the antient Discipline of remitting matters to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Church did cease, yet sincerity and uprightness in passing Sentence still continued. The which when <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Emperour observed, and considered the great difference there was between the captious, and litigious proceedings of secular Advocats, and Proctors, who made Law-suits and wranglings their benefit and Trade, and the honest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Methods, and determinations of the Clergy; he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that the Sentence of the Bishop should be definitive and without appeal, with power to grant an injunction to all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings at Common Law, in case the party agrieved should desire to have recourse to the Episcopal judgment, and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in his case.</p>
            <p>Hence it came to pass that the Sentence of the Bishop was<note place="margin">The degrees by which the greatness of the Clergy did arise.</note> made a judgment of Court, and put in execution by the hands of the secular Magistrate: and this jurisdiction was farther am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified and increased in the year 365. by the Decree of the Emperour <hi>Valens.</hi> But the extent of this Authority, establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:50681:6"/>
by the Law of <hi>Constantine,</hi> being afterwards abused by the corruption of succeeding Bishops, was recalled by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours <hi>Arcadius,</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> and confined to causes purely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, without Courts or formal processes of Law, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power to intermeddle in civil differences, unless the parties concerned should on both sides agree to remit their case by way of Arbitration, or compromise to the Sentence of the Bishop. But in regard the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> had for a long time been powerful in that City, little notice was taken of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction until in the year 452. it was again enforced, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour. But not long afterwards the succeeding Emperours restored part of that Authority which had been taken from them, and <hi>Justinian</hi> again erected their Courts of Judicature, to which he assigned all Causes about Religion, complaints, and differences between the Clergy, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Fines and forfeitures, with power to determine Cases between Lay-persons who should by way of Umpirage, or Arbitration refer themselves to the Episcopal Court: and in this manner did that charitable correction, and that plain, and sincere way of ending and composing differences between Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, instituted by Christ Jesus begin to degenerate into that Dominion which our Saviour had forbidden to his Apostles.</p>
            <p>And farther to strengthen, and confirm this Episcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority so soon as the Empire was divided, and that the Western Provinces were separated from the Eastern Dominions; then were many of the Bishops taken into the Councils of Princes, whereby the Secular Power being annexed to their Spiritual ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, served much to advance, and raise the reputation, and Authority of the Episcopal Dignity: so that two hundred years had not passed in this manner, before the Bishops arrogated to themselves a Power to judg the Clergy in all Cases both Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Civil; And to extend their Jurisdiction farther, they framed a Term, called <hi>Mixed Actions,</hi> in which the Bishop, as well as the Secular Magistrate might grant Process; that is, in matters where the Judg had not been diligent, or cold, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, or dilatory in his proceedings, then the Bishop might take the Causes out of his hands: by which pretence and usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation little business remained for the Secular Courts. And farther, by vertue hereof they established a general, standing Rule, as unalterable, as a fundamental of Faith: that in Cases where the Magistrate was remiss, or delayed to do Justice,
<pb facs="tcp:50681:6"/>
those Causes did <hi>ipso facto,</hi> devolve to the cognizance of the Bishop. Had the Prelats stuck at this point, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded farther, it had been pretty tolerable; for then a Power might have remained still in the hands of the Civil Magistrate, to moderate and retrench the excesses of Ecclesiastical encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as occasion served: but those, who had imposed this yoak on the people, thought fit for their own security, to rivet it in such manner about their necks, that it could never be shaken off again; having to that purpose forged a principle in their own Shops under the Title of a fundamental point of Faith. That <hi>the Bishops power of judging in Causes, as well tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as spiritual, took not its Original and Authority from the Decrees, or connivence of Emperours, or from the will and pleasure of the people, or by custom, or prescription; but from a right inherent in the Episcopal Dignity and conferred thereupon by the institution of Christ himself.</hi> As appears in the History of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> wrote by Father <hi>Paul Sarpi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was certainly a bold and a hardy Assertion, which could so easily have been refuted by those who had read the Codes of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and <hi>Justinian,</hi> with the Capitularies of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and Concessions and Ordinances of succeeding Princes, both of the Eastern and Western Empire: in reading and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering which, a Man must be strangely blind, or stupid, who cannot observe by what ways, and Methods, the excess, and exorbitance of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction was introduced into the World. And indeed it is strange to consider, that on the bare foundation of that Spiritual Power to bind and loose, given by Christ to his Church; and by that Ordinance of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to compose differences between the Brethren, and prevent their going to Law before Infidels, should by a long tract of time, and by several Artifices, and subtil contrivances, be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected a Temporal Tribunal the most extensive, and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable of any that ever was in the World: and that in the midst of divers Kingdoms and Principalities of <hi>Europe,</hi> there should be an other State established, independent on the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; which is such a Model, and form of Political Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as never any of the Antient Legislators could ever fansie, or imagine to be consistent with the Sovereignty of a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Prince.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:50681:7"/>
            <p>But such a Government as this, was long in growing, and<note place="margin">The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the Clergy met in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves great.</note> required much time to bring it to a maturity, because many difficulties interposed in the way. For in the first place, the very foundation of Christianity, which was humility, was dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically opposite to Grandeur and Dominion: then the Popes were chosen by the People, to whom they were accountable for all their administrations, and to the Clergy for their soundness in Faith, and Orthodox Doctrine; for which reason Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the first was Interdicted by the Clergy from celebrating Divine Service in <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> until he had disclaimed pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly the Heresie he held of one Operation or Will in Christ; the Assertors of which were called <hi>Monothelites;</hi> and this Choice of the People required a confirmation from the Emperour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope could be legally invested in his Authority; the which is apparent in all History; and in regard the Seat of the Emperours was far distant, a Power was delegated to the Exarch of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> to confirm the suffrages of the people, in case the person they had chosen was not obnoxious, or displeasing to the Emperour: and so it was, when <hi>Severinus</hi> was made Pope, that <hi>Isaacius</hi> the Exarch of <hi>Italy,</hi> made a journey to <hi>Rome</hi> to confirm him, though before his departure he plundered the <hi>Lateran</hi> of its Treasures: in which attempt, though he was opposed by some of the Clergy, yet his Soldiers being too strong for them, he carried away his prize, upon a pretence, that it was unreasonable the Clergy should grow rich, and the State poor; and that they should amass vast sums into their Coffers, when the Soldiers, who were their defence, and guard, were miserably necessitous, and in a starving condition.</p>
            <p>Nor had the See of <hi>Rome</hi> less difficulty in its advancement, by reason of the long disputes, and contentions between that, and the Church of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for precedency; to which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Princes gave encouragement, who asserted that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy ought to be lodged at that place, which was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and esteemed the Capital Seat of the Empire: On the other side the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops, termed <hi>Constantinople</hi> but a Colony of <hi>Rome,</hi> since the <hi>Greeks</hi> themselves stiled their Prince <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Emperour of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and the <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitans</hi> themselves even in that age were called <hi>Romans,</hi> and not <hi>Greeks:</hi> the which Controversie remained undecided until the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, who by great intercession, and a powerful interest obtain'd of the Emperour <hi>Phocas,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:50681:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the See of <hi>Rome</hi> should be acknowledged; and stiled the Head of all the Churches.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding this priviledg given to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Popes depended on the Emperor.</note> the Popes continued still in their dependence on the Emperor's confirmation, without which their Election was not valid. And though in the time of <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Pelagius</hi> the 2d. was made Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> without the Imperial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and confirmation; and though the same was excused by a cause of necessity occasioned by the Siege which the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> had laid to the City; yet the Emperour was much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with this encroachment upon his Prerogative, until such time as <hi>Gregory</hi> a Deacon a Person of great Piety, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was sent to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to appease his anger.</p>
            <p>In this manner the Popes depended on the Emperours plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for their confirmation until about the year 705. when <hi>Benedict</hi> the second was created Pope, a Person of so much piety and vertue, and of compassion towards the poor, that he gained an esteem, aud veneration from all people of what degree soever; and so great was his renown, that the report of his Vertue and Devotion reaching the Ears of the Emperour; he conceived such a high Opinion of his Sanctity, that he sent him a Decree, whereby he ordained and established, that for the time to come, He whom the Clergy and people of <hi>Rome</hi> should choose Pope, should be immediately acknowledged, without recourse to the Authority of the Emperour, or his Exarchs according to former custom, when the confirmation of the Emperour or his Lieutenant in <hi>Italy</hi> was esteemed neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the establishment of a Pope.</p>
            <p>But whence this Temporal Power was derived in its first<note place="margin">How the Temporal Power was derived to the Popes.</note> Original to the Popes, hath been an enquiry of divers Authors: There are those who pretend a Donation from the Emperour <hi>Constantine,</hi> by which the City of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, most part of <hi>Italy, Africa,</hi> and all the Islands of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas were conferred upon them. But this Opinion is exploded by <hi>Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardin</hi> an Author without exception in this case. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in all History these particulars are very clear and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, as namely, That during the Exarchate, the Popes had nothing to do with the Temporal Sword, but lived as Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Emperour. That after the overthrow of the Exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate, the Emperours neglecting <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> began to be governed by the advice and power of the Popes. That

               <hi>Pepin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> having subdued the Kingdom of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> gave unto Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 3d. and his Successours <hi>Ravenna, Urbin, Ancona, Spoleto,</hi> with many other Towns, and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries about <hi>Rome:</hi> in testimony and remembrance of which there remains unto this day a Marble Stone ingraven in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> with this Inscription thereupon, and Englished thus: <hi>Pepin the most pious King of</hi> France <hi>was the first who gave example to Posterity, how and in what manner the Power and Authority of Holy Church was to be amplified and increased.</hi> After which <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> or <hi>Charles</hi> the Great the Son of <hi>Pepin,</hi> having made his entrance into <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the first, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Oath, and amply enlarged the Donation which his Father <hi>Pepin</hi> had made to <hi>Gregory</hi> the 3d. which as our <hi>Platina</hi> saith, <hi>contained in</hi> Liguria, <hi>all that reaches from the long since de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished City</hi> Luna <hi>to the</hi> Alps, <hi>the Isle of</hi> Corsica, <hi>and the whole Tract between</hi> Luca <hi>and</hi> Parma, <hi>together with</hi> Friuli, <hi>the Exar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chate of</hi> Ravenna, <hi>and the Dukedoms of</hi> Spoleto, <hi>and</hi> Beneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum. And though the Popes having this Temporal Power began to set up for themselves, maintaining, That the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Dignity was to give Laws to the Emperours, and not to receive them: yet this Doctrine was not openly asserted, during the Reign of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> who challenged and exercised the antient, and original power to govern the Church, to call Councils, and to order the Papal Election. The which Power continued for a long time in his posterity, and so afterwards remained, so long as wise and valiant Princes ruled; but when weak Princes, who were distracted with great and dangerous Wars governed, then the Popes prevailed, who were strong in their Councils, being for the most part composed of subtil and designing Men: Howsoever these turns of Fortune were carried in succeeding times with various changes and successes: the Emperour sometimes tugging, and plucking from the Pope, and the Pope from the Emperour, winning, or losing ground, as they were endued with abilities, courage and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or as the circumstances of the World were ordered, and disposed in different times. So <hi>Hadrian</hi> the 3d. was a Man of so great a Spirit, that immediately upon his advance to the Popedom, <hi>Anno</hi> 895. he proposed to the Senate and people, that a Law should pass, that no regard should be hereafter given to the Authority of the Emperour in the creation of a Pope: taking, as <hi>Platina</hi> saith, an advantage when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb facs="tcp:50681:8"/>
               <hi>Charles</hi> was marched with his Army out of <hi>Italy</hi> against the rebellious <hi>Normans.</hi> This must have been <hi>Charles le Gros,</hi> and the year 885. according to those Authors who have written the History of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which must have given this Pope courage herein,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald</hi> resigns the power of Election of the Emperour to the Pope.</note> was the weakness of <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> a Prince bold in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, but unable in the execution of them, for so soon as he received information of the death of the Emperour <hi>Lewis</hi> the 2d. he resolved to seize the Empire, which at that time was confined to the narrow compass of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all <hi>Italy;</hi> because his two Uncles had miserably rent the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy in pieces, and divided between them after the death of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius</hi> those two Kingdoms which belonged unto him. But to be short, <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald</hi> in order to his design raised all the Troops he was able, and on a sudden passing the <hi>Alps,</hi> he so surprised the <hi>Lombards,</hi> that not being provided of a Force to resist, they presenty yielded themselves unto him; and therewith the Treasure of <hi>Lewis</hi> deceased, which he so well employed at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he corrupted therewith both the Senate and the Magistrates, and promised great matters to Pope <hi>John</hi> the 8th, if by his means he might obtain the Imperial Crown. This Pope, whom we call <hi>Pope Joan,</hi> (the Story of whom, being a Woman, and with Child, is related by divers Authors, and not wholly disbelieved by our <hi>Platina</hi>) acting according to the false wisdom of this World, as appears in many particulars of which <hi>Baronius</hi> accuses him, (or her,) thought fit to make advantage of this ambition of <hi>Charles,</hi> that thereby he might for the future procure a right to Popes to elect and create Emperours. But our <hi>Platina</hi> saith it was <hi>John</hi> the 9th. but be it <hi>John</hi> the 8th, or the 9th. he conferred with the Barons and principal Lords of <hi>Rome</hi> on this point, who being already prepared by the bribes of <hi>Charles,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoyed to become Electors, easily concurred with the Pope in the proposal he made to them in favour of <hi>Charles;</hi> who being accordingly invited to <hi>Rome,</hi> made his entry there, on the 18th. of <hi>December,</hi> in the year of our Lord 856, and on the 25th. day following being <hi>Christmas</hi> day, the Pope pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and Crowned him Emperour in St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church with the consent of the Prelates, Chief of the Clergy, and all the People of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:50681:9"/>
            <p>But lest this assumption of <hi>Charles</hi> to the Empire should seem to proceed from a right of Succession, and not of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, like the other three <hi>French</hi> Emperours his Predecessours: the Pope designing to put the matter out of dispute, that so the Emperour might own his Title to be derived from him, and his Nobles; and no other; he held an Assembly at <hi>Pavia,</hi> composed of Bishops and Counts, where having first shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fiattered him with praises of notorious falsity extolling him above <hi>Charlemagne;</hi> he declared, that his Election was an effect of his merit, and piety, and agreeable to the Will of God, which had long before been revealed to Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> by divine inspiration: and in pursuance hereof the Act of Election was signed, and confirmed by the whole Assembly, and registred in the Books of that Court. In this manner the right of those who were descended from <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and the Sovereignty which the Emperours had until that time exercised in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in all the Lands of the Ecclesiastical State, was surrendred up into the hands, and power of the Pope: in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of which, as it is most certain, that several succeeding Popes did challenge a right of Creating Emperours, or at least to the confirmation of them, by that right which they had to Crown them: so also it is apparent that there have been Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, who after this time have exercised a Sovereign power in <hi>Italy,</hi> and without regard to the base condescention of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald,</hi> have made themselves Masters of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Pope himself. An example whereof we have in <hi>Otho</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, who recovered three advantageous points, which the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Emperours had enjoyed, and which <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald</hi> had lost and betrayed to the Pope. Namely, 1. The Sovereign power in <hi>Rome</hi> it self. 2. The right of Succession of his Children to the Empire. 3dly. A power to Elect a Pope, or what amounts to the same thing; a Right to hinder any from being chosen, who was not agreeable to his good will or pleasure: Nay farther, it is apparent in History, that the Popes themselves; as well as others, did take the Oath of Fidelity, as it was administred to them by the Emperour's Commissioners: and it is as certain, that from the time that <hi>Justinian</hi> recovered <hi>Rome</hi> from the <hi>Goths,</hi> the Emperours were ever Masters of the Election in such manner, as that either it could not pass without his permission, or being done, required his confirmation. Accordingly <hi>Otho</hi> the 3d. caused <hi>Bruno</hi> his
<pb facs="tcp:50681:9"/>
near Kinsman, Son of <hi>Otho</hi> Duke of <hi>Franconia</hi> and <hi>Suabia,</hi> his own Cousin-German to be chosen Pope, who took upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 5th. But at length by other turns of fortune, <hi>Hildebrand</hi> who was <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th. in the year 1073. raised the Papacy to the highest pitch of power and honour that ever it was in. Upon consideration of which whole matter, it is certain, that the Pope had some right in the Election of the Emperour: for when the Kingdom of <hi>Italy</hi> with <hi>Rome</hi> it self was united to the <hi>Teutonick</hi> or <hi>German</hi> Kingdom, and that by the Donation of <hi>Pepin</hi> the Popes were Masters of the Exarchate, <hi>Urbin, Ancona, Spoleto,</hi> and other Towns and Countries, and confirmed by <hi>Charles</hi> his Son; then the Pope himself representing the people of <hi>Rome</hi> by his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats with the Princes, Lords, and Deputies of the Towns of <hi>Italy,</hi> had a priviledg of giving his Votes at those Elections: and on no other foundation than this could the Pope pretend co a right of Electing Emperours, nor in any other manner than as he was Prince over a Dominion which had a right of Election in concurrence with other States, Princes, and Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dataries of the Empire. But when and in what manner, and by what Methods afterwards this power, of Election came to be transferred to the seven Electors, is not very clear in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,<note place="margin">How the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours was transferred to the seven Electors.</note> there being many and various conjectures thereupon. <hi>Maimbourg</hi> in his History called <hi>la Decadence de l'Empire,</hi> concludes, that this Institution was established by the Authority of <hi>Gregory</hi> the 10th. in the year 1274. And farther he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to say:</p>
            <p>That the second Pope from whom we may conjecture, that this Authority was derived, was <hi>Leo</hi> the 8th. who by a Decree made by and with the consent of the Clergy, and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> gives and grants unto the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> the first, and to those who should succeed him, a Right for ever to chuse a Successour: and certainly he could not mean a Successour to the Kingdom of <hi>Germany,</hi> which was hereditary, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, and therefore it can onely have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Imperial Dignity. Now whereas by the decease of <hi>Otho</hi> the 3d. who died without issue, this Right of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour devolved to the States, who succeeded to the Sovereign Authority; for it is a sure Maxim, That the King cannot die: they therefore challenged, and appropriated to themselves the same Right of chusing Emperours, the which afterwards they
<pb facs="tcp:50681:10"/>
resigned, and transferred to the seven Electors, who exercise the same power unto this day; three of which, <hi>viz. Mentz, Triers,</hi> and <hi>Colen</hi> are Ecclesiasticks, being Arch-bishops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Chancellours, to shew and keep in remembrance, that the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical State had once a Right in the Election of Emperours. But Historians are so much at variance in this point, and relate it with such variety, that we shall not search farther into this matter, but proceed to our purpose of the Election of Popes, and of the formality therein used in this Age.</p>
            <p>We have in our foregoing Discourse mentioned, that Popes were antiently chosen by the Nobility, Clergy and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was certainly the Original Custom. Though the Book of the Sacred Ceremonies uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> tells us, <q>That St. <hi>Peter</hi> named <hi>Clemens</hi> for his Successour, provided, that it might so seem good to the Senators of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that is, to the <hi>Presbyters;</hi> of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> had constituted a College of twenty four before his death, with power, and Authority to decide, and determine all matters of difficulty arising in the Church. The which <hi>Presbyters</hi> having little or no regard to the nomination, and appointment of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> chose <hi>Linus,</hi> and after him <hi>Cletus,</hi> and then <hi>Clemens</hi> succeeded, who was rather recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, than chosen by St. <hi>Peter;</hi> that so it might more plainly appear, that Popes had not a Right to Elect their Successours; for if that priviledg was denied to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> much more ought it to be unto those who succeeded him. These twenty four <hi>Presbyters</hi> were in the time of Pope <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester</hi> the first, called <hi>Cardinals,</hi> that is, Princes in the Church;<note place="margin">Presbyters called <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,</hi> and when.</note> on whom <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4th. at the Council of <hi>Lions</hi> bestowed the red Hat, as a mark and badg of their Dignity: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Schisms, and Dissentions arising amongst the Senators, the Clergy and people of <hi>Rome</hi> were admitted to be present at the Election, but to have no Voice, or Suffrage therein: afterwards the force and violence of the people was such, that they would have a Voice, and concur with others in their Votes. This popular way of Election caused such heats and disturbances, that the Emperours were constrained for keeping the peace to interpose by their Authority, and to Order, that no Election should stand good until it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Imperial approbation. The Kingdom of the <hi>Lombards</hi> being overthrown in the year 776. the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb facs="tcp:50681:10"/>
was translated from the <hi>Greek</hi> to the <hi>German</hi> Princes, and then <hi>Charles</hi> the Great assumed, and exercised this power of Electing, or what is all one, the confirming of Popes. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Series of pious Emperours succeeding, and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Supreme Bishop was Instituted, and Ordained by Christ himself to be a Shepherd to the Emperour, as well as to feed his other Flock, and to purge, and spiritually to judg them, they renounced the power of confirming Popes, and entirely transferred it to the <hi>Roman Presbyters,</hi> the Clergy and the people. This popular manner of Election produced parties, Schisms and contentions, which often broke forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to bloud, and wounds; so that there was scarce a Regular Election for a long time, the strongest always possessing the Chair, until he was subverted by another more powerful than himself: so that in the space of few years, nine several Men seized on the Papal Chair; namely, <hi>Benedict</hi> the 9th. <hi>Sylvester</hi> the 3d. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 6th. <hi>Clement</hi> the 2d. <hi>Damasus</hi> the 2d. <hi>Leo</hi> the 2d. <hi>Victor</hi> the 2d. <hi>Stephen</hi> the 9th, and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict</hi> the 10th. To which last <hi>Nicolas</hi> the 2d. succeeding, a person of unparallel'd Sanctity and Wisdom, did in the year 1051. study to cure and prevent these riotous courses for the future, which upon the choice of every Pope were ready to bring, and precipitate every thing into confusion. For a Remedy whereunto he established a Law, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confirmed by the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> that the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Popes should entirely rest, and remain in the power of the Cardinals: the which Law or Canon was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards<note place="margin">Election of Popes by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and when begun.</note> confirmed by <hi>Alexander</hi> the 3d. and by <hi>Gregory</hi> the 10th. in the Council of <hi>Lions,</hi> and at <hi>Vienna</hi> by <hi>Clement</hi> the 6th. The which happy Constitution hath tended much to the peace and quiet of the Church; and as a Rule hereof <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the 3d. instituted at a General Council, that he onely should be esteemed to have been canonically elected, who had obtained his Choice by at least two Thirds of the College of Cardinals.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This power of Election hath ever since that time rested in the power of the Cardinals, who after the <hi>Octaves</hi> appointed for solemnizing the Funerals of the deceased Pope, have on the 9th or 10th. day entered the <hi>Conclave</hi> in order to a new Election. The <hi>Conclave</hi> is for the most part held at the <hi>Vatican</hi> Palace: where in a long Gallery are erected small Apartments, or Cells
<pb facs="tcp:50681:11"/>
made of boards, covered with purple Cloth for every Cardinal, which place is appointed for the more convenient conference each with other: to every Cardinal is allowed no more than two Servants, which are called his <hi>Conclavists,</hi> unless in case of sickness or other infirmity, when three may be admitted. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals<note place="margin">The form and manner of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Popes.</note> being entered, the <hi>Conclave</hi> is strictly guarded with the City Militia, to hinder all commerce, and intercourse of Letters from without. The Gallery also is very closely watched, being kept by a Master of the Ceremonies; so that when the Cardinals have their Dishes served up to them, they are visited and inspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, lest any Letters, or Advices should be concealed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Meat. According to this first Institution; the Cardinals have a free use of several dishes of Meat for the first three days: and whilst they are eating, or doing any thing else in their Cells, the outward Curtains are to be open, and undrawn, unless in the Night when they sleep, or at other times, that they take their repose: when great care is taken, that no undecent noise, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance be given. It hath been accustomary of late years, for the Cardinals to premise certain particular points and Articles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and convenient for the better government of the Church, which are subscribed by the whole Community, and every one takes an Oath to observe them, in case he should prove to be the person chosen, and promoted to the Pontifical Dignity. After which matters are performed, they proceed to an Election.</p>
            <p>There are three ways by which Popes are chosen, namely, by<note place="margin">The several ways by which Popes are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and the methods and forms thereof.</note> Scrutiny, by Access, or by Adoration: the first is, when every Cardinal writes in a Scroll of paper, the name of that person whom he designs to be elected, folding it into five several pages, or columns. On the first of which he writes these words, <hi>Ego eligo in summum Pontificem Reverendissimum Dominum meum Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalem</hi> — the which is written by the hand of the <hi>Conclavist,</hi> that the Cardinal may not be discovered by his own writing. On this fold two others are doubled down, and some Wax dropped thereupon, and sealed with some private Seal made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; on the 4th. page the Cardinal writes his own name, and covers the same with the 5th. folding. Then all the Cardinals sitting in their Order on Benches in the Chappel, with the Scrolls they have prepared in their hands; take their turns to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend unto the altar, before which a Table is placed covered with a purple Cloth, and a Chalice with a <hi>Patina,</hi> or plate set thereupon: On the right side of which sits the first Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

Bishop, and on the left the first Cardinal Deacon, then every one kneeling makes a short Prayer, and arising puts his Scroll into the Chalice; which being done, and all the Cardinals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their places; the first Cardinal Bishop takes the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice with his right hand, and turns out all the Scrolls upon the <hi>Patina,</hi> or plate which he holds in his left: then setting the Chalice again on the Altar, he takes the Scroll which comes first to hand, and gives it to the Deacon Cardinal, who reads it with an audible Voice; the Cardinals noting with their pen and ink, or Table-book how many Voices every person hath; and the Papers being read, the Master of the Ceremonies comes in with a pan of coals, and burns all the papers or Scrolls, so that no Man is known for which person he hath given his Vote. In case any person hath gained two thirds of the number there present, the election is good and he is presently declared Pope. And this is the way of Scrutiny which is the most commonly used, and practised in the election of Popes. When the choice is not determined by Scrutiny, it is then tried and proved by Access, or <hi>Accessus,</hi> which is performed in this manner: All the Cardinals sitting in their Places, one arises, and goes to the Cardinal, whom he designs to have elected, and says, <hi>Ego ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedo ad Reverendissimum Dominum meum talem,</hi> the which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the other Cardinals, as are the names of those, who make the Access and those to whom they are made. If two thirds agree in their Access to one person, the election is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Access: if not, the next day they proceed again to the Scrutiny, for it cannot be made twice in a day. This way of Access seems to resemble the antient manner of giving Votes in the Senate of <hi>Rome;</hi> when those that concurred in the same Opinion with an other, went from his place to that side, where the motion was first made, whence came that saying, <hi>Ire in sententiam;</hi> and something we have like it in our Parliaments when the House divides it self.</p>
            <p>The third way by Adoration is performed almost in the same manner as that by Access; the Cardinal approaching him, whom he desires to have created Pope, with a profound reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and lowly bowing: but both the Access, and the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are to be proved, and confirmed by the Scrutiny.</p>
            <p>There was antiently another way of Election which was<note place="margin">The ways of Election by compromise and inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> called by Compromise, which was, when the divisions were high, and scarce determinable by the <hi>Conclave,</hi> that then the
<pb facs="tcp:50681:12"/>
Cardinals with common consent referred all their Votes to the choice of three or five Cardinals, giving them power to elect any person, whom all or the major part should chuse; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and obliging themselves to rest, and remain satisfied with such choice by them made, provided, that the said election were concluded, and determined within the time, that a Candle lighted by the common consent of all the <hi>Conclave</hi> did last and continue. Hereupon, if any election were made during such time, the person so chosen was acknowledged for Pope, and Universal Bishop.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there is another way of election, called by <hi>Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> that is, when the Cardinals are Assembled in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and that every one hath taken his place according to his degree, and order. Then the first Bishop arises, and in a short Speech exhorts the Fathers to provide such a person for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, as by his Wisdom, and Sanctity may be capable to sustain so great a burden. Then he demands of them the manner, by which they are pleased to proceed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Compromise, or by Scrutiny: telling them, that if his Opinion, and Vote might prevail, he would chuse no other than — and accordingly did elect him for Supreme Bishop, and Head of the Universal Church. If in case all then present, or at least two thirds of the number did concur in such person so nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; he was then without farther process, or Scrutiny cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically elected Pope. Which manner of election was frequently practised amongst the Antients, and was called, by Inspiration, or designation of the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>The Pope being legally chosen by any of the foregoing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, he is conducted into the <hi>Sacristia</hi> or Vestry; where being disrobed by the Cardinal-Deacons of his own Habit, he is cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Pontificalibus, or Papal Vestments, and being thence brought forth with his Mitre on his Head adorned with Gold, and Jewels into the Chappel, he is seated on the Altar; where the Cardinals perform the ceremony of Adoration to him, every one in his order, kissing his feet, hands, and mouth.</p>
            <p>Whilst these Ceremonies are performing, all the doors, and gates of the <hi>Conclave</hi> are opened; at which a multitude of people appearing, the Pope shews himself, and blesses them. And then the first Deacon Cardinal proclaims with a loud Voice to the people in these words: <hi>Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum, Papam habemus: Reverendissimus Dominus Cardinalis — electus est
<pb facs="tcp:50681:12"/>
in Summum Pontificem, &amp; elegit sibi nomen.</hi> This being said, the Pope descends into St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church, the Cardinals leading the way with a Cross carried before them; and going directly to the High Altar, he takes off his Mitre, kneels and prays a while, and returns thanks to God, and the Blessed Apostles; and then arising sits upon the Altar; and the first Bishop kneels, and sings <hi>Te Deum:</hi> and then again the Cardinals perform their Act of Adoration, kissing the feet, hand and mouth of the Pope. Which, and the short Office being finished, the Pope blesses the people again; and then in the same order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his Apartment to take his repose, and the Cardinals to their respective Lodgings.</p>
            <p>The Pope being chosen, for the most part changes his Name,<note place="margin">Why Popes changed their names, and since that time.</note> it having been an antient custom so to do, and observed unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to those Popes, who have retained their own baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Names without alteration. Our <hi>Platina</hi> saith, <q>That the first who began this Form, was <hi>Sergius</hi> the Second, who came to the Popedom at the same time, that <hi>Michael</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of <hi>Constantinople</hi> died. This <hi>Sergius,</hi> 'tis said, was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Bocca di Porco,</hi> or Hog's Snout, which for shame he changed into <hi>Sergius,</hi> Anno 843. and from thence came the custom down to our times, that when any one is made Pope, he laid by his own Name and took one of some of his Predecessours, though all have not observed it.</q> Thus far are the words of <hi>Platina.</hi> And since that time the Popes have commonly out of gratitude taken the Name of that Pope, by whose favour he was first created Cardinal.</p>
            <p>In all Histories we read of great Divisions, and Factions in the Elections of Popes, even in the first times, when the popular tumults proceeded to the heighth of Rage and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: causing sometimes such difficulties in the Elections, that after the decease of <hi>Nicolas</hi> the First: <hi>Platina</hi> reports, that some Authors say, <hi>that the See of</hi> Rome <hi>was vacant eight years, seven months, and nine days;</hi> and then <hi>Hadrian</hi> the 2d. was chosen in the year 868. Afterwards in the year 1051. when <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Second had cured these riotous courses by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the whole power of Election into the hands of the Cardinals, the Elections were then carried more smoothly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and with less noise; but the Factions were not abated, but oftentimes kept up with such Art and Interest, that after the decease of <hi>Clement</hi> the 4th. the differences held for the space
<pb facs="tcp:50681:13"/>
of two years before the election of <hi>Gregory</hi> X. who was the next Successour, came to be determined. And now even in these days many Intrigues are managed in the <hi>Conclave</hi> before an Election can be perfected: for the Emperour, and the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> must first be consulted; and every Cardinal hath some Patron, or Friend, or Interest of his own to advance; every one takes his measures of the person, that may best suit and agree with his designs. And now of late years, since the Monarchy of <hi>France</hi> hath over-topped all the other Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignties of Christendom which depend on the Papal See, that King must first be consulted, and his assent taken before the Pope can be created; as appears by the election of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI.</p>
            <p>In some convenient time after the Election, or upon the<note place="margin">The Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties used at the Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Popes.</note> first great Festival ensuing, a day is appointed for the Pope's Coronation. It would perhaps be very long, and tedious in a Preface of this nature to describe distinctly all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thereof, the particulars of which take up the space of a whole day from Morning until Night; so that in the midst of them the Pope, and Cardinals are constrained to take a short repose, and refreshment to support the labour of the day. For in the Morning early the Pope goes from his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber into the Chamber called <hi>Papagalli;</hi> where he is clothed by the Cardinal-Deacons, Sub-deacons and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers belonging to that Chamber with a white Cassock girt about with a long Girdle: over it, he wears his Stole and <hi>Pluvial,</hi> or Robe of a Scarlet colour, with a rich Mitre on his Head set with many pretious Stones: And in this Habit, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the train of his Robes carried up by the Emperour, or some King then present; or in their absence by one of the chiefest Princes then attending at that Ceremony; and a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopy of State over his Head supported by eight Ambassadours or Nobles, and the Cardinals in their Habits walking before with a Cross for their Banner, they orderly proceed to St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church: where being entered, and having laid aside his Mitre, and prayed a while, he arises and goes in the Chappel of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> otherwise called the Chappel of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> where being sate in a Chair placed there for that purpose, he receives all the Cardinals with their Caps on their Heads, to kiss his Hand, and other Prelates to kiss his Feet: then the Pope arising stands up, and blesses the people: after which the Sub-deacon
<pb facs="tcp:50681:13"/>
reads the Epistle, and all the rest of the Office for the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being performed, the Pope vests himself with the Pontifical Habit according to the Method prescribed for those Rites. According to the antient constitution, it belonged only to the Bishop of <hi>Hostia</hi> to consecrate the Pope; but of late years, the first Cardinal Bishop performs that function: when the Pope is consecrated, he is anointed with Oil on his Head, and on the palms of his Hands; but the day of his Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not always the day of his Coronation. All the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as we have said, being finished, and the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self having celebrated the Mass; they proceed then to the solemnities of the Coronation. And in the first place the Pope goes to the stairs ascending to the Altar of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where a Throne is erected for him, on which being seated, he is encompassed by his Prelats, and the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to withdraw at some distance: then the Dean-Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal takes off the Mitre from the Head of the Pope, and places it on the left hand; and having the <hi>Triara</hi> ready, or the Triple Crown, he sets it on his Head, the people making a loud Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation with a <hi>Kyrie Eleison,</hi> or <hi>Lord have mercy upon us.</hi> Then the Dean publishes the Indulgences which the Pope is pleased to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>; and when he proclaims them on the right hand, he recites them in <hi>Latin,</hi> and on the left in the vulgar Language.</p>
            <p>After which, a Dinner is prepared for the Pope and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals at the Palace of the Arch-Presbyter of St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s, and for the other Prelats at the Houses of the Canons: and having taken their repast, the Cardinals mount on their Mules, and the Pope on his Horse, and with a Noble train of all the Officers and Nobles in their due rank and order, they march in solemn procession to the <hi>Lateran;</hi> where the Pope alighting from his Horse, is met by the chief Canon of the Church, who offers the Cross to be kissed by him, which the Dean-Cardinal ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from his hands, puts it to the mouth of the Pope. Then the triple Crown being taken from off his Head, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the custody of the Auditor of the <hi>Rota,</hi> who is one of the chief Justices; and the Mitre is again planted on the Pope's head; for the burden of the Triple Crown is so heavy, with the Gold and Jewels, that it is not born on the head without much trouble. <hi>Platina</hi> saith, <q>That <hi>Paul</hi> the Second so delighted to see his Triple Crown studded with precious
<pb facs="tcp:50681:14"/>
Stones, that he exhausted the Treasury of the Church to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase Jewels at any rate; which being fixed in his Crown, and Mitre, he looked like the picture of a <hi>Cybele</hi> with Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets on her Head; and were so weighty, and so burdensom on his Brow, that they put his gross body into a violent heat, and sweat, which produced an Apoplexy, of which soon after he died.</q> But to proceed; The Pope wearing his Mitre is conducted to the <hi>Sedes stercoraria,</hi> on which he seems rather to lye, than to sit; from whence being raised with honour by the Cardinals, the Hymn is sung. <hi>He hath put down the mighty from their Seats, and hath exalted the humble and meek; he hath raised the needy from the dust, that he may set him amongst the Princes of his People.</hi> After which several other Ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing performed, and the Pope receiving again the Adoration of the Cardinals, and Prelats, returns towards the Evening to his Palace of <hi>Monte-cavallo.</hi> This is in short the sum of those Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies practised at the Coronation of Popes, which we have extracted from the Book entitled <hi>the Sacred Ceremonies used in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Popes Elected, and Crowned (as we have said) are<note place="margin">Popes very aged before they are Elected.</note> for the most part old, and decrepit with age, or of a weak and tender constitution, that so they may not live long to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of others, who live, and breath passionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires after this Sublime exaltation: and being thus decayed with years, and unable to support the weight of Government; have commonly called to their aid, some Nephew, or near Relation, with the Title of <hi>Cardinal-Nephew,</hi> or <hi>Cardinal-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi> on whose Wit, and dexterous management of Affairs the fortune and success of the Papal Dominion doth depend. And indeed a person under such circumstances had need to be qualified with great endowments of Mind, and Body: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always obliged to afford his personal attendance on the Pope, who is to see, and hear with his Eyes, and Ears, he can never be at leisure, or free from thoughts and business, either relating to the Palace within, or direction of Affairs without. He is ever the Chief, or President of Councils, he assists at all Congregations; he appoints the days for Consistories, of Chappels, Visits, Audiences, and regulates every thing which relates to the Spiritual or Temporal Government.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:50681:14"/>
            <p>The Pope being established in his Throne, begins at first<note place="margin">Popes usually advance their Families.</note> to cast about by what way and means to raise and establish his Family, by strong Alliances with Princes, and Noble Houses. He also divides the great Offices of the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his Kindred: one is made Governour in one place, and an other in another. The chief Favourite is made General of the Forces of the Church, an other General of the Gallies, a third Governour of the Castle of St. <hi>Angelo;</hi> and in like manner all the preferments are dispensed amongst the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to that degree, and quality that every one pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses in the good will, and esteem of the Pope.</p>
            <p>But the great <hi>Atlas</hi> of State is the Cardinal-Nephew, whofe<note place="margin">The great Art of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Nephew, is how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himself towards fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Ministers.</note> Wisdom is most exerted in his comportment towards the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of forein Princes, and especially in taking true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Interest between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> which is of such great concernment, that in a Book called <hi>il Livello Politico,</hi> it is affirmed, <q>That the Glory, and happiness of the Popedom, the security, and honour of the Cardinal-Nephew, the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieur and prosperity of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> consists in this one point, of a happy correspondence with forein Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, the failure in which hath produced many unhappy Events: witness the Government of the <hi>Barberini,</hi> who, for not knowing the true means and Methods, how and in what manner to maintain a right and good understanding with Christian Princes, and especially with those of <hi>Italy,</hi> reduced (as is notorious to all the World) the Church unto a most unhappy, and turbulent Estate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And farther, in case we reflect with serious thoughts on the Reigns of divers Popes in these latter Ages, we shall find the truth of this assertion proved by plain, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest experience. We shall find the Reigns of some Popes full of Lustre and Glory, as those of <hi>Paul</hi> the 2d. and <hi>Clement</hi> the 8th. others buried in obscurity, and abased with sordid meanness, as those of <hi>Adrian</hi> the 6th. and <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13th. Others have passed away in a quiet, silent and smooth currant of affairs, as those of <hi>Celestine,</hi> and <hi>Clement</hi> the 9th. Others have been engulfed in a thousand troubles and intrigues, as were the Reigns of <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6th. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the 7th. of <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d and 4th. and <hi>Urban</hi> the 8th. And if we will search into the depth hereof we shall find, that the Ambition, covetousness, and exorbitances of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal-Nephews<pb facs="tcp:50681:15"/>
to be the original cause of all the troubles, and misfortunes which have rendered the Lives of some Popes inglorious, or perhaps infamous.</q> Though indeed to speak true, it is almost impossible for a Cardinal-Nephew to hold the ballance of his deportment towards foreign Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives residing in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> so equal, as not to give a cause, or occasion of offence to some one or other: considering, that what is pleasing and acceptable to one, dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies, and interferes with the interest of an other. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, there are some Men so dexterous and happy in their Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, that they carry all with a good Air, and if they are enforced to disoblige some, it is done with such circumstances, and in such manner, as takes off much of the anger and acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the person offended.</p>
            <p>Most Princes of Christendom, who are of the <hi>Roman</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion<note place="margin">The reasons for which the Christian</note> maintain their Ambassadours, Residents, or Agents at the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> and though many of these Princes have no<note place="margin">Princes main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Ambassadors.</note> great zeal, or kindness for that Court, being disobliged perhaps by some action of the Cardinal-Nephew, or some other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice taken against the Pope; yet it may be that on some score of Interest of State, or of their Clergy, or for the sake, or support of Monasteries, or for the determination of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which arise between them, and their Subjects, which are to be decided at the Spiritual Judicatures; it is necessary for them to conserve an Agent, or Resident at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour hath seldom maintained an Ambassadour at that Court; because he ordinarily makes use of a Protector of the <hi>German</hi> Nation, to manage his Affairs: and in case any matter of great importance occurs, which is to be addressed unto the Pope, it is performed by some Cardinal in whom his Imperial Majesty reposes a great confidence, unless he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches an Express.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> follows almost the same Maxim; but yet professes a profound Obedience to the Papal See, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises the power and interest he hath there with such modesty and caution, that though like other Kings, he might pretend to a Right of nominating Cardinals of his own Nation, yet he seldom imposes any, but such as the Pope shall offer of his own accord unto him.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:50681:15"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Portugal</hi> for the most part maintains a Resident at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The State of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the G. Duke of <hi>Tuscany</hi> make greater applications, than the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to that Court; perhaps from a sence of the Pope's temporal power, whose Dominions border upon theirs, rather than out of an affection to his Spiritual capacity.</p>
            <p>But, it is certain, that amongst all the Christian Princes, none so warmly interest themselves in the Affairs of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, as <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the Kings of which do always maintain and keep up the honour of their respective Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies with splendid Equipage. And yet these two Kings do in a different manner depend on the Court. <hi>France</hi> hath no great Obligation or dependency upon <hi>Rome,</hi> unless it be in some respects to the privileges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. But <hi>Spain</hi> is engaged in a kind of Partnership with <hi>Rome</hi> in Government and Jurisdiction, and is beholden thereunto for a great part of its Revenue. The Income of the <hi>Crusada</hi> granted by the Popes to the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> is one of the chief branches of the Royal Revenue: The Tribunals of the <hi>Inquisition</hi> are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely constituted by the Ecclesiastical Authority, which gives such an unlimited power to the Nuntios, Judges, and Officers of the Pope within the Catholick Dominions, as doth very much eclipse, and diminish the greatness of that Monarch: whereunto when we add the Tribute yearly paid by that King to the Pope for the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> it seems, as if they two held the reins of Government in partnership together: onely with this difference, that though the Pope hath intermixt his power with the Temporal, yet the King dares not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in matters Ecclesiastical.</p>
            <p>Hence we may see, how dangerous it is, for Kings to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Partners with them in their Thrones: Never was the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> more abased, and rendered inglorious, than when the Inquisition was set up, and an other power intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to allay and attemper the Sovereign Authority: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>France</hi> having no need of such dependencies hath always kept up, and asserted the Right of Monarchy, not suffering it to be debased by the Concessions of <hi>Regalia,</hi> or other mean Compliances.</p>
            <p>And indeed how much more happy now is the Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> than in the time of King <hi>John,</hi> who was forced to yield that of <hi>England</hi> to the Pope and his Successours: and
<pb facs="tcp:50681:16"/>
how considerable, and flourishing hath it been, since it hath disowned all dependencies on forein power either in Church or State: in defence of which, may His Sacred Majesty King <hi>James</hi> the Second, who is the Supreme Moderator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour thereof, upon Earth, live long, and Reign happily: and when it shall please the King of Kings to translate Him from a fading to an Immortal Crown, there may never fail one of his Royal Line to sit upon His Throne, and defend His Loyal People against all the Encroachments, and Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of forein Jurisdiction.</p>

               <p>AFTER the Death and Resurrection of Christ, and the Completion of the days of Pentecost; the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples received the Holy Ghost: and being filled with the Spirit, they published the wonderful works of God in divers Tongues, though most of them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were look'd upon as utterly illiterate men. Their manner of living was mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd by the common Good; none of them challenged any propriety in any thing; and whatsoever Religious Oblation was laid at their feet, they either divided it between themselves for the supply of the necessities of Nature, or else distributed it to the Poor, These Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples had each of them his Province assigned to him; to St. <hi>Thomas</hi> was allotted <hi>Parthia,</hi> to St. <hi>Matthew Aethiopia,</hi> to St. <hi>Bartholomew India</hi> on this side <hi>Ganges,</hi> to St. <hi>Andrew Scythia,</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> to St. <hi>John;</hi> who after a long series of toyl and care, died during his abode at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> But to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the chief of the Apostles, were assigned <hi>Pontus, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> who being by birth a <hi>Galilean,</hi> of the City of <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> the son of <hi>John,</hi> and Brother of <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apostle, sate first in the Episcopal See of <hi>Antioch</hi> for seven years in the days of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Emperour was Son-in-law and Heir to <hi>Augustus,</hi> and for the space<note place="margin">Tiberius.</note> of twenty three years his administration of the Government had so much of change and variety in it, that we cannot reckon him altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a bad, or absolutely a good Prince. He was a Man of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and weighty Eloquence; his Wars he managed not in Person, but by his Lieutenants: and shew'd a great deal of Prudence in suppressing any sudden commotions. Having by Arts of flattery enticed sevcral Princes to his Court, he never suffered them to return home again: as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

among others <hi>Archelaus</hi> of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> whose Kingdom he made a Province of the Empire. Many of the Senators were banish'd, and some of them slain by him. <hi>C. Asinius Gallus</hi> the Pleader, son of <hi>Asinius Pollio,</hi> was by his Order put to death with the most exquisite torments; and <hi>Vocienus Montanus Narbonensis,</hi> one of the same profession, died in the <hi>Baleares,</hi> whither <hi>Tiberius</hi> had confined him. Moreover Historians tell us, that that his Brother <hi>Drusus</hi> was poisoned at his command. And yet upon occasion he exercised so much lenity, that when certain Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Governours of Provinces moved him to raise the publick taxes, he gave them this Answer, <hi>That a good Shepherd does indeed shear, but not flay his sheep.</hi>

               <p>

                  <hi>Caligula,</hi> succeeded him in the Empire; he was the son of <hi>Drusus</hi> (son-in-law to <hi>Augustus</hi>) and Nephew to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> The greatest Villain in the World, and one who never did any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Action either at home or abroad. His Avarice put him upon all manner of Oppression; his Lust was such, that he did not forbear to violate the Chastity of his own Sisters; and his cruelty was so great, that he is reported oftentimes to have cryed out, <hi>Oh! That all the people of</hi> Rome <hi>had but one Neck!</hi> At his Command all who were under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription were put to Death; for having recalled a certain person from banishment, and enquiring of him, what the Exiles did chiefly wish for; the man imprudently answering, that they desired nothing more than the Death of the Emperour; he thereupon gave order that every man of them should be executed. He would often complain of the condition of his times, that they were not rendred remarkable by any publick Calamities, as those of <hi>Tiberius</hi> had been, in whose Reign no less than 20000 men had been slain by the fall of a Theatre at <hi>Tarracina.</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd so much envy at the renown of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Livy,</hi> that he was very near taking away their Writings and Images out of all the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; the former of which he would censure as a man of no Wit and little Learning, the latter as a verbose and negligent Historian; and it was his common by-word concerning <hi>Seneca, That his Writings were like a rope of Sand. Agrippa</hi> the son of King <hi>Herod,</hi> who had been cast into prison by <hi>Tiberius</hi> for accusing <hi>Herod,</hi> was by him set at liberty, and made King of <hi>Judoea;</hi> while <hi>Herod</hi> himself was confin'd to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual banishment at <hi>Lyons.</hi> He caused himself to be translated into the number of the Gods, and ordered the setting up Images in the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> At last he was assaulted and slain by some of his own Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, in the third year, and tenth month of his Empire. Among his Writings were found two Rolls or Lists, one of which had a Dagger, the other a Sword stamp'd upon it for a Seal; they both contain'd the Names and Characters of certain principal men, both of the Senatorian and Equestrian Order, whom he had design'd to slaughter, There was found likewise a large Chest fill'd with several sorts of Poisons, which being at the Command of <hi>Claudius Coesar,</hi> not long after, thrown into the Sea, 'tis reported that the Waters were so infected thereby, that there died abundance of Fish, which the Tide cast up in vast numbers upon the neighbouring shores.</p>
               <p>I thought good to give this account of these Monsters of men, that thereby it might the better appear, that God could then have scarce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born

destroying the whole World, unless he had sent his Son and his Apostles; by whose bloud manking, though equal to <hi>Lycaon</hi> in impiety, was yet redeem'd from destruction. In their times lived that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> whom our Saviour (upon his ackowledgment of him to be the Christ) bespake in these words; <hi>Blessed art thou Simon Bar Jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven;</hi> and, <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church; and I will give unto thee the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Power of binding and loosing.</hi> This Apostle being a Person of most unwearied indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, when he had sufficiently setled the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> and confuted the Opinion of those who maintained the necessity of <hi>Circumcision,</hi> came into <hi>Italy</hi> in the second year of <hi>Claudius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Claudius,</hi> who was Uncle to <hi>Caligula,</hi> and had been all along very<note place="margin">Claudius.</note> contumeliously treated and bussoon'd by his Nephew, being now Emperor, making an Expedition into <hi>Britain,</hi> had the Island surrendred up to him; an Enterprise which none before <hi>Julius Coesar,</hi> nor any after <hi>Claudius</hi> durst undertake: he also added the Isles of <hi>Orkney</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. He ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd out of the City of <hi>Rome</hi> the seditious <hi>Jews,</hi> and suppress'd the tumults in <hi>Judoea,</hi> which had been rais'd by certain false Prophets. And while <hi>Cuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was appointed by him Procurator of <hi>Judoea,</hi> there were crush'd to Death in the Porches of the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> during the days of Unlca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened bread to the number of thirty thousand <hi>Jews.</hi> At the same time also there was a great dearth and ſcarcity of provision throughout the whole World; a Calamity which had been foretold by <hi>

Being secure of any hostilities from abroad he finish'd the Aquaeduct that had been begun by <hi>Caligula,</hi> whose ruines are yet to be seen in the <hi>Lateran.</hi> He attempted also to empty the Lake <hi>Fucinus,</hi> being prompted thereto by the hope of getting not only honour and reputation, but profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it; since there was a certain person who proffered to undertake that work at his own private charge, upon condition that the Land when it was drein'd might have been granted to him for his reward. The Mountain being partly undermin'd, partly cut through, the length of three miles, the Passage was at the end of eleven years with much ado finish'd, there being no less than 30000 labourers continually employ'd in it. It was he likewise that made the Harbour of <hi>Ostia,</hi> by drawing an Arm of the Sea on each hand, and so breaking the violence of the Waves; a Work, the footsteps of which are not to be seen at this day without Wonder. Having put to death his Wife <hi>Messalina</hi> for Adultery, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, against all Law both Humane and Divine, married <hi>Agrippina</hi> the Daughter of his Brother <hi>Germanicus,</hi> by whom in the fourteenth year of his Empire he was poison'd with Mushrooms prepared by her for that purpose.</p>
               <p>In his time St. <hi>Peter</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> the principal City of the World; both because he judg'd it a Seat best accommodated to the Pontifical dignity, and because likewise he understood that <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> a certain<note place="margin">Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</note>

ends, he laid the foundation of divers Heresies. To him was joyn'd one <hi>Sebene</hi> a shameless Strumpet, who was his Companion and partner in Villany. To such an heighth of impudence did this lewd Fellow arrive, that he challenged St. <hi>Peter</hi> to work Miracles with him; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly he undertook to raise to life a dead child; which indeed at first seem'd somewhat to move at his Charms: But it being manifest present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Child nevertheless continued dead still, at St. <hi>Peters</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Name of <hi>Jesus,</hi> it immediately arose. <hi>Simon</hi> being enraged hereat, profered, as a further trial which of them was the more holy man, and more beloved of God, to fly from the Capitol to the <hi>Aventine</hi> in the sight of all the People, provided <hi>Peter</hi> would follow him. While he was yet flying, at the prayer of <hi>Peter</hi> who with hands lift up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, beseeched God not to suffer so great a multitude to be deluded with Magical Arts, down he fell and broke his Leg, with grief of which Mis-adventure he not long after died at <hi>Aricia,</hi> whither his followers had conveighed him after this foul disgrace. From him the Hereticks called <hi>Simoniaci</hi> had their original, who pretended to buy and sell the Gift of the Holy Ghost, and who asserted the Creatures to proceed from a certain superiour Power, but not to be from God.</p>
               <p>After this St. <hi>Peter</hi> applying himself both by Preaching and Example<note place="margin">S. <hi>Mark.</hi>
                  </note> to the propagating of the Word of God, was by the Christian <hi>Romans</hi> earnestly desired, that <hi>John</hi> surnamed <hi>Mark,</hi> who was his Son in <hi>Baptism,</hi> and a person of a most approved life and conversation, might be employed by him in writing a Gospel. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> saith that he being a Priest in <hi>Israel,</hi> a Levite according to the flesh, after his conversion to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, wrote his Gospel in <hi>Italy;</hi> shewing what he owed to his own Parentage and Extraction, and what to Christ. Which Gospel, as we now have it, was approved by the testimony of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards sent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> a famous Writer tells us, after that by Preaching and Writing he had well form'd the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Church, being a man very eminent both for his Life and Learning, in the eighth year of the Emperor <hi>Nero,</hi> he died and was buried at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria;</hi> in whose place succeeded <hi>Anianus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The year before died <hi>James,</hi> surnamed <hi>Justus,</hi> the Brother of our<note place="margin">James.</note> Lord, being the Son of <hi>Joseph</hi> by another Wife, or, as some will have it, Sisters son to <hi>Mary</hi> Christ's Mother. <hi>Egefippus,</hi> who lived near the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times, affirms of him that he was holy in his Mothers Womb; that he drank neither Wine nor strong drink, nor ever tasted flesh; that he neither shaved, nor bathed, nor anointed himself, nor ever wore any other but linnen garments. He was often accustomed to enter into the Holy of Holies, where he continued so incessantly in his Prayers for the Welfare of the People, that his knees were grown hard and callous like those of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels. But <hi>Festus</hi> leaving the Government of <hi>Judoea,</hi> before <hi>Albinus</hi> his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor arrived there, the High Priest <hi>Ananus,</hi> the son of <hi>Ananus,</hi> requiring <hi>James</hi> publickly to deny Christ to be the Son of God, upon his refusal he gave order he should be stoned to Death; who, after he had been thrown down headlong from a pinacle of the Temple, continuing yet half alive, and with hands stretch'd forth towards Heaven praying for his persecutors, was at last kill'd outright with a blow of a Fullers Club. <hi>Josephus</hi> reports him to have been a man of so great sanctity, that it was the general belief that his murder was the cause of the destruction
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50681:20"/>
of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> This is that <hi>James,</hi> whom our Lord appeared to after his Resurrection, and to whom, having blessed Bread and broken it, he said, <hi>Brother eat thy Bread, because the son of man is risen.</hi> He presided over the Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> thirty years, that is, to the seventh year of <hi>Nero.</hi> His Sepulchre with an Inscription, hard by the Temple from which he had been cast down, was yet in being in <hi>Andrian'</hi>s time.</p>
               <p>It is evident likewise that <hi>Barnabas,</hi> by birth a Cypriot, surnamed <hi>Joses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Barnabas.</note> a Levite, died before St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s martyrdom. He being chosen together with <hi>Paul</hi> an Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> wrote only one Epistle of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the Church, and that too is reckoned Apocryphal There happening to be a difference between him and <hi>Paul</hi> occasioned by <hi>Mark</hi> a Disciple, he accompanied with the said <hi>Mark,</hi> went to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where Preaching the faith of Christ he was crowned with Martyrdom. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paul.</note> first called <hi>Saul,</hi> was descended of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> of a Town of <hi>Judoea,</hi> called <hi>Giscalis;</hi> which being taken in War by the <hi>Romans,</hi> he with his Parents removed to <hi>Tarsus</hi> a City of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent thence to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to study the Law, he had his Education under the learned <hi>Gamaliel.</hi> After this receiving Letters from the High Priest, he became a Persecutor of those that professed Christ to be the true God; and particularly was present and assistant at the death of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> the Protomartyr. But as he was going to <hi>Damascus,</hi> being by the Divine Spirit wonderfully converted to the Faith, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>chosen Vessel;</hi> and from that time took the name of <hi>Paul,</hi> from a Pro-consul of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> whom by his preaching he had converted to Christianity. After this he, together with <hi>Barnabas,</hi> having travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led through divers Cities, upon his return to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, John,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> chosen an Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> In the twenty fifth year after the death of Christ, which was the second of the Emperor <hi>Nero,</hi> and the time when <hi>Festus</hi> succeeded <hi>Felix</hi> in the Procurator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Judoea,</hi> he with his fellow-captive <hi>Aristarchus</hi> was as a free Denizon sent bound to <hi>Rome;</hi> where continuing the space of two years under very little confinement, he was daily engaged in disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the <hi>Jews.</hi> Being at length set at liberty by <hi>Nero,</hi> he both preached and wrote many things. We have at this day fourteen of his Epistles; one to the <hi>Romans,</hi> two to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> one to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> one to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> one to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> one to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> two to the <hi>Thessalonians.</hi> two to <hi>Timothy,</hi> one to <hi>Titus,</hi> and one to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon;</hi> that to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is generally said to be his, though because of the difference of style and phrase from the rest, it be uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were so or no; and there have been anciently divers who have entituled it, some to <hi>Luke,</hi> some to <hi>Barnabas,</hi> some to <hi>Clemens.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> also wrote two general Epistles, though the latter be by many denied to be his for the same reason of the difference of style. But being so taken up with Prayer and Preaching, that he could not attend any other great variety of business, he constituted two Bishops, <hi>viz. Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus,</hi> who might exercise the sacerdotal Ministery to the <hi>Romans</hi> and other Christians. The holy man applying himself entirely to these things, gained thereby so great and universal a Reputation, that men were ready to worship him as a God. The Emperor <hi>Nero</hi> being displeased hereat, began to contrive his death; whereupon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Friends, that he might avoid the Emperours envy and rage,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50681:21"/>
departed out of the City by the <hi>Via Appia;</hi> and at the end of the first mile he travelled, to use the words of <hi>Egesippus,</hi> meeting with Christ in the way, and falling down and worshipping him, he said, <hi>Lord whither goest thou?</hi> to whom Christ replied, <hi>I go to</hi> Rome <hi>to be crucified again.</hi> There is yet remaining a Chappel built on the same place where these words were spoken. Now St. <hi>Peter</hi> believing this saying of our Saviour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to his own martyrdom, because Christ might seem to be ready to suffer again in him, went back to the City, and forth with consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Clemens</hi> a Bishop, and in these words recommended to him his Chair, and the Church of God; <hi>I deliver to thee the same power of binding and loosing which Christ lest to me; do thou, as becomes a good Pastor, promote the salvation of men both by Prayer and Preaching, without regard to any hazard of Life or Fortune.</hi> Having set these things thus in order, at the Command of <hi>Nero</hi> in the last year of his Empire, He was put to death together with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though the kinds of their Punishment were different. For St. <hi>Peter</hi> was crucified with his Head towards the ground, and his Feet upwards, for so he desired it might be, saying, That he was unworthy to undergo the same kind of death with his Saviour. He was buried in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> in the <hi>Via Aurelia,</hi> near <hi>Nero's</hi> Gardens, not far from the <hi>Via Triumphalis</hi> which leads to the Temple of <hi>Apollo.</hi> He continued in the See 25 years. But St. <hi>Paul</hi> being on the same day beheaded, was interred in the <hi>Via Ostiensis,</hi> in the 37th year after the death of Christ. This is confirmed by the testimony of <hi>Caius</hi> the Historian, who in a Disputation against one <hi>Proculus</hi> a Montanist has these words; <hi>I,</hi> says he, <hi>can shew you the Victorious Ensigns of the Apostles; for you cannot pass the</hi> Via Regalis <hi>that leads to the</hi> Vatican, <hi>nor the</hi> Via Ostiensis, <hi>but you will find the Trophies of those Hero's that established this Church:</hi> where certainly he refers to these two St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul.</hi> In the fore-mentioned Gardens of <hi>Nero,</hi> were reposited the ashes of a multitude of holy Martyrs. For a Fire happening in the time of <hi>Nero,</hi> which raging for six days together, had wasted a great part of the City, and devoured the substance of many wealthy Citizens, the blame of all which was laid upon the Emperour; He, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us, being very desirous to quell the rumour, suborn'd false Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to accuse, and lay all the blame of that Calamity upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. Whereupon so great a number of them were seiz'd and put to death, that it is said the flame of their empaled bodies supplied the room of lights for some nights together. There are those who say this Fire was kindled by <hi>Nero,</hi> either that he might have before his Eyes the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of burning <hi>Troy,</hi> or else because he had taken offence at the irregularity of the old Houses, and the narrowness and windings of the streets; neither of which are improbable of such a man as he, who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligately self-will'd, intemperate and cruel, and in all respects more lewd and wicked than his Uncle <hi>Caligula.</hi> For he both put to death a great part of the Senate, and also without any regard to Decency would in the fight of the People sing and dance in the publique Theatre. His dissolute Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury was such, that he made use of perfum'd cold Baths, and fished with golden Nets, which were drag'd with Purple Cords. Yet he took such care to conceal all these Vices in the beginning of his Empire, that men had generally great hopes of him. For being put in mind to sign a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant according to Custom for the Execution of one that was condemn'd to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50681:21"/>
die, <hi>How glad,</hi> says he, <hi>should I be that I had never learnt to write.</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was very sumptuous in his Buildings both in the City and elsewhere; for the Baths called by his Name, and the <hi>Aurea Domus,</hi> and the <hi>Portico</hi> three miles long were finish'd by him with with wondrous magnificence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides which he was at a vast expence to make the Haven at <hi>Antium,</hi> at the sight of which I my self not long since was wonderfully pleased. I return to his Cruelty, which he exercised towards his Master <hi>Seneca,</hi> towards <hi>M. Annoeus Lucanus</hi> the famous Poet, towards his Mother <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippina,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Octavia,</hi> towards <hi>Cornutus</hi> the Philosopher <hi>Perfius'</hi>s Master, whom he banish'd, towards <hi>Piso,</hi> and in a word towards all those who were in any reputation among the Citizens. In the end, he so highly provok'd the rage and hatred of the people against him, that most diligent search was made after him to bring him to condign punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Which punishment was, that being bound, he should be led up and down with a Gallows upon his neck; and being whipped with Rods to Death, his body should be thrown into the River <hi>Tyber.</hi> But he making his escape four miles out of the City, laid violent hands upon himself in the Countrey-house of one of his Freemen; between the <hi>Via Salaria,</hi> and <hi>Nomentana,</hi> in the thirty second year of his Age, and of his Reign the fourteenth.</p>

                  <hi>LINUS,</hi> by Nation a <hi>Tuscan,</hi> his Father's name <hi>Herculeanus,</hi> was in the Chair from the last year of <hi>Nero</hi> to the times of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and from the Consulship of <hi>Saturninus</hi> and <hi>Scipio,</hi> to that of <hi>Capito</hi> and <hi>Rufus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this space of time there were no less than three Emperours, <hi>Galba, Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius,</hi> each of them reigning but a very little while.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galba,</hi> a Person descended of the most ancient Nobility, being created<note place="margin">Galba.</note> Emperour by the Soldiers in <hi>Spain,</hi> assoon as he heard of the death of <hi>Nero,</hi> came immediatey to <hi>Rome.</hi> But rendring himself obnoxious to all men by his Avarice and Sloth, through the treachery of <hi>Otho,</hi> he was slain at <hi>Rome</hi> near <hi>Curtius'</hi>s Lake in the seventh month of his Reign; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Piso</hi> a Noble Youth whom he had adopted for his Son. He was doubtless a man, who before he came to the Empire, was very eminent in the management both of Military and Civil affairs; being often Consul, often Proconsul, and several times General in the most important Wars. That which makes me speak this in his praise, is the Learning of <hi>M. Fabius Quintilianus,</hi> whom <hi>Galba</hi> brought with him out of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Otho,</hi> a man of better extraction by his Mother's than by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's<note place="margin">Otbc.</note> side, who while he led a private life was very loose and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as being a great and intimate Friend of <hi>Nero'</hi>s, in the midst of tumults and slaughters, as I hinted before, invaded the Empire. But being ingaged in a Civil War against <hi>Vitellius,</hi> who had been created Emperour in <hi>Germany,</hi> though he got the better in three small Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, one at the <hi>Alps,</hi> another at <hi>Placentia,</hi> the third at <hi>Castor;</hi> yet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50681:22"/>
losing the day in the last and most considerable, which was at <hi>Bebriacum,</hi> he thereupon fell into so deep a melancholly, that, in the third month of his Empire he stab'd himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vitellius,</hi> concerning whose Extraction there are different Opinions,<note place="margin">Vitellius.</note> coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and obtaining the Empire, soon degenerated into all manner of lewdness, cruelty and gluttony, being used to make several Meals in a day, and some of them to such an height of Luxury, that there have been at one Supper no less than two thousand Fishes, and seven thousand Fowl serv'd up to his Table. But having intelligence that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian,</hi> who had been created Emperour by the Army in <hi>Judoea,</hi> was advancing with his Legions, he at first determin'd to quit the Empire; yet being afterwards encouraged by those about him, he took up Arms, and forc'd <hi>Sabinus, Vespasian'</hi>s Brother, with his <hi>Flavian</hi> Soldiers into the Capitol; which being set on fire, they were all burnt. Hereupon being surpriz'd by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and having no hope of pardon left him, he hid himself in a private Chamber in the Palace, from whence he was most ignominiously drag'd and carried naked through the <hi>Via Sacra</hi> to the <hi>Scaloe Gemonioe,</hi> where being quartered he was thrown into the River <hi>Tyber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this time <hi>Linus</hi> was Successor to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> though there are some who place <hi>Clemens</hi> here, and wholly leave out <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus;</hi> who yet are sufficiently confuted not only by History, but also by the authority of S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> who tells us, that <hi>Clemens</hi> was the fourth Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> after <hi>Peter,</hi> for <hi>Linus</hi> was accounted the second, and <hi>Cletus</hi> the third, notwithstanding that most of the <hi>Romans</hi> immediately after <hi>Peter</hi> reckon <hi>Clemens.</hi> To whom, though St. <hi>Peter</hi> had as it were by Will bequeath'd the Right of Succession, yet his modesty was so great that he compelled <hi>Linus</hi> and <hi>Cletus</hi> to take upon them the Pontifical Dignity before him, lest any ambition of preheminence might be of ill example to after Ages. This <hi>Linus</hi> by Commission from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ordained that no Woman should enter the Church but with her Head veiled. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, at two Ordinations which he held in the City, he made eighteen Presbyters and eleven Bishops. He wrote also the Memoirs of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and particularly the Contention he had with <hi>Sinion Magus.</hi> In his time lived <hi>Philo,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> by Nation of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in whose Writings there is<note place="margin">Philo Judoeus.</note> so much Wit and Judgment, that, from the likeness there appears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, he deserv'd to have it proverbially said, Either <hi>Plato</hi> does <hi>Philonize,</hi> or <hi>Philo</hi> does <hi>Platonize.</hi> By his Learning and Eloquence he corrected the rashness of <hi>Appion,</hi> who had been sent Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour from the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> with Complaints against the <hi>Jews.</hi> While he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Claudius</hi> his time, he contracted an acquaintance with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and thereupon wrote several things in praise of the Christians. <hi>Josephus</hi> also, the son of <hi>Matathias,</hi> a Priest at <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Josephus.</note> being taken Prisoner by <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and committed to the custody of his son <hi>Titus</hi> till that City was taken, coming to <hi>Rome</hi> during the Pontificate of <hi>Linus,</hi> presented to the Father and the Son seven Books of the <hi>Jewish</hi> War, which were laid up in the publick Library, and the Author himself, as a reward for that performance, had most deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Statue erected to him. He wrote likewise twenty four other Books of Antiquities, from the beginning of the World to the fourteenth year of the Emperour <hi>Domitian.</hi> As for <hi>Linus</hi> himself, though he had gain'd a <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50681:22"/>
mighty reputation by the sanctity of his Life, by his Power of casting out Devils and raising the Dead, yet was he put to Death by <hi>Saturninus</hi> the Consul, whose very Daughter he had dispossess'd; and was buried in the <hi>Vatican</hi> near the Body of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> on the twenty first day of <hi>September,</hi> when he had ſat in the Pontifical See eleven years, three months, and twelve days.

For all <hi>Judoea</hi> being conquer'd, the City <hi>Hierusalem</hi> destroyed, and the Temple levelled to the ground, it is reported that no less than six hundred thousand <hi>Jews</hi> were slain; nay <hi>Josephus</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> who was a Captive in that War, and had his life given him because he foretold the death of <hi>Nero,</hi> and that <hi>Vespasian</hi> should in a short time be Emperor, relates that eleven hundred thousand perished therein by sword and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and that a hundred thousand were taken Prisoners, and publickly exposed to sale. Nor will it seem improbable, if we consider that he tells us this happened at the time of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when they came from all parts of <hi>Judoea</hi> to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as into a publick Prison; and especially on the day of the Passeover, upon which they crucified Christ: being now to undergo the deserved punishment, both of their frequent revolts from the <hi>Roman</hi> Government; and also of their villany and perfidiousness in putting to death the innocent Jesus. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Victory over the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Father and Son were honoured with a Triumph, both riding in the same Chariot, and <hi>Domitian</hi> upon a white Horse following them. The Monuments of this Triumph remain still in the <hi>Via Nova,</hi> where are to be seen engraven the Candesticks and the Tables of the old Law that were taken out of the Temple and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly brought away. Yet <hi>Vespasian</hi> exercised so much humanity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Jews,</hi> even when they were conquered, that for all those whom he found among them remaining of the House of <hi>David,</hi> as being of Royal descent, he had a very good esteem. And indeed he always used his Power with great Moderation, being of so mild and merciful a Temper, as to discharge even Traytors with no other than a verbal Correction, and to slight the Discourses of insolent and talkative people,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50681:23"/>
and in general to be forgetful of Faults and Injuries. He was look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as too much enclin'd to Avarice; and yet he used no oppression for the getting of Money, and what he had he employed in Bounty and Magnificence. For he both finish'd the Temple of Peace adjoyning to the <hi>Forum,</hi> that had been begun by <hi>Claudius;</hi> and began that Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre, a part of which is yet to be seen with admiration. He had so great an opinion of the Bravery and Merit of his Son <hi>Titus,</hi> that upon occasion of certain tumults, rais'd by some ambitious men who aspir'd to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, he said publickly, <hi>That either his Son, or no man, would be his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor in the Empire.</hi> And good ground he had to say so, for that <hi>Titus,</hi> both<note place="margin">Titus.</note> for his Courage and Integrity was accounted the Darling and Delight of Mankind. He was endued with an Eloquence excellency suited to the times of Peace, and with a Courage to those of War; he was very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to Offenders, and so kind and bountiful to all, that he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied any man any thing. Upon which occasion when some of his Friends took the liberty to find fault with him as too profuse; he told them, <hi>It was not fit that any man should depart sad out of the presence of a Prince.</hi> And remembring at a certain time that he had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd any benefit in a whole day, he thereupon cried out to those about him, <hi>My Friends, I have lost a Day.</hi> Never any Emperour was superiour to him in Magnificence; the Amphitheatre, together with the Baths near adjoyning, being perfectly compleated and dedicated, and an Hunting of five thousand wild Beasts exhibited by him. He recall'd from Exile <hi>Mursonius Rufus</hi> a famous Philosopher, and was much pleased with the conversation of <hi>Asconius Poedianus</hi> a most learned man. He died in the second year of his Empire, and was carried to his Sepulchre with so great and universal a lamentation, as if every man had lost a Father.</p>
               <p>There are some who write that <hi>Cletus</hi> succeeded <hi>Linus</hi> in the second year of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> who held the Empire ten years.

He lived eighty four years, was married in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and buried at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whither his bones, together with those of <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apostle, were in the tenth year of <hi>Constantius,</hi> conveyed out of <hi>Achaia.</hi> At the same time like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Philip</hi> returning out of <hi>Scythia,</hi> which by his Example and<note place="margin">Philip.</note> Preaching he had kept stedfast in the faith for twenty years together, into <hi>Asia,</hi> died at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> As for <hi>Cletus</hi> himself, having setled the Church as well as the Times would bear, and ordain'd according to St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s command twenty five Presbyters, he was crown'd with Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Reign of <hi>Domitian,</hi> and buried near the body of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> April 27. There were many other Martyrs about the same time, among whom is reckoned <hi>Flavia Domicilla,</hi> Sisters Daughter to <hi>Flavius Clemens</hi> the Consul who was banish'd into the Island <hi>Pontia</hi> for the profession of Christianity. <hi>Cletus</hi> sate in the Chair twelve years,

Many of the Nobility he put to death, whereof most were by his order assassined in the places whither he had banish'd them. He was so industriously idle as to spend the time of his privacy and retirement in killing Flies with a Bodkin; for which reason when a certain person coming out of his Presence was asked, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any one were with <hi>Coesar,</hi> he answer'd merrily, <hi>No, not so much as a Fly.</hi> He arriv'd to such an heighth of Folly and arrogance, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect divine Honours, and command that in all Discourses and Writings concerning him, the Title of Lord and God should be given him. He was the second from <hi>Nero</hi> that rais'd a Persecution against the Christians. Moreover, he gave order that all those of the Linage of <hi>David</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> should by Interrogatories and racking them to Confession be diligently search'd after, and being found utterly destroy'd and extin guish'd.

He wrote in the name of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church a very useful Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> not differing in style from that of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which is said to be St. <hi>Pauls.</hi> This Epistle was formerly read publickly in several Churches: there is another bearing his name which the Ancients did not thing authentick; and <hi>Eufebius</hi> in the third Book

He wrote several other things, and among the rest his <hi>Revelation,</hi> during his banishment into the Island <hi>Patmos</hi> by <hi>Domitian;</hi> who being afterwards slain and his Acts for their excessive severity rescinded by the Senate, he returned to <hi>Ephesus</hi> in the time of <hi>Nerva;</hi> where he continued till the Reign of <hi>Trajan,</hi> supporting the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> by his Counsel and Writings, till at last being worn out with Age he rested in the Lord the sixty eighth year after the Passion of Christ.

In this Island there being at that time a great scarcity of water, which they were forced to fetch at six miles distance, <hi>Clement</hi> going going to the top of a little Hill hard by, sees there a Lamb, under whose right foot flowed miraculously a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Spring, with which all the Islanders were refresh'd, and many of them thereupon converted to the Christian faith. At which <hi>Trajan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enraged, sent some of his Guards, who threw <hi>Clement</hi> into the Sea, with an Anchor tied about his neck. But his blessed Body was not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cast on the shore, and being buried at the place where this miraculous fountain had sprung up, a Temple was built over it.

Through his procurement the Acts of <hi>Domitian</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd by Decree of the Senate, multitudes thereupon return'd from banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and several by his bounty had the Goods of which they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been plundered, restor'd to them. But being now very old, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50681:24"/>
drawing near to the time of his Death, out of his care of the Publick Weal, he adopted <hi>Trajan,</hi> and then died in the sixteenth Month of his Reign, and of his Age the seventy second year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trajan</hi> himself, a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> surnamed <hi>Ulpius Crinitus,</hi> coming to the<note place="margin">Trajanus.</note> Empire surpassed the best of Princes in in the glory of his Arms, the the Goodness of his Temper, and the moderation of his Government. He extended the bounds of the Empire far and wide, reduced that part of <hi>Getmany</hi> beyond the <hi>Rhine</hi> to its former state, subdued <hi>Dacia,</hi> and several other Nations beyond the <hi>Danow;</hi> recovered <hi>Parthia;</hi> gave a King to the <hi>Albanians;</hi> made Provinces beyond <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tygris;</hi> overcame and kept <hi>Armenia, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Seleucia, Ctesiphon</hi> and <hi>Babylon;</hi> and proceeded as far as the borders of <hi>India,</hi> and the Red Sea, where he left a Fleet to infest those Borders.</p>
               <p>The Ecclesiastical Laws and Constitutions of <hi>Anacletus</hi> were as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; <hi>viz.</hi> That no Prelate or other Clerk should suffer his beard or hair to grow long; that no Bishop should be ordained by less than three other Bishops; that the Clergy should be admitted into holy Orders in publick only; and that all the faithful should after Consecration com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate or be put out of the Church. By this means the Christian interest encreas'd, that <hi>Trajan</hi> fearing lest the <hi>Roman</hi> State might be impaired thereby, gave allowance to a third Persecution of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, in which multitudes were put to Death, and particularly <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ignatius.</note> the third Bishop of the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> after St. <hi>Peter.</hi> Who being taken and condemn'd to suffer by wild beasts, as he was carried to <hi>Rome</hi> by his Guards, whom he called his Ten Leopards, he all along in his passage encourag'd and confirm'd the Christians, by Discourse with some, and by Epistle to others; declaring his readiness to suffer in this manner; <hi>Come Cross, come Beasts, come Wrack, come the torture of my whole body, and the torments of the Devil upon me, so I may enjoy Christ.</hi> And upon the occasion of his hearing the Lions roar, <hi>Corn,</hi> says he, <hi>I am, let me be ground by the teeth of these beasts, that I may be found fine bread.</hi> He died in <hi>Trajan'</hi>s eleventh year, and his bones were afterwards buried in the Suburbs of <hi>Antioch.</hi> But <hi>Plinius Secundus,</hi> who was then Governour of that Province, being moved with compassion to see so many executed, wrote to the Emperour <hi>Trajan,</hi> informing him that incredible numbers of men were daily put to Death, who were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of an unblameable life, and who in no point transgressed the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, save only that before day-break, they would sing Hymns to Christ their God, but that Adulteries and the like Crimes were disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and abominated by them. Hereupon <hi>Trajan</hi> gave order, that the Magistrates should not make search after the Christians, but only punish those who voluntarily offered themselves. During this Persecution <hi>Simeon,</hi> the kinsman of our Lord, son of <hi>Cleophas</hi> and Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was crucified in the hundred and twentieth year of his Age. These things which we have spoken were acted in the time of this Bishop and not of <hi>Cletus,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the third book of his History would have it; for <hi>Damasus</hi> makes out that <hi>Cletus</hi> and <hi>Anacletus</hi> differed both as to their Countrey and manner of Death, <hi>Cletus</hi> being a <hi>Roman</hi> and suffering under <hi>Domitian,</hi> but <hi>Anacletus</hi> and <hi>Athenian</hi> and suffering under <hi>Trajan.</hi> Our <hi>Anacletus</hi> having erected an Oratory to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and assigned places of burial for the Martyrs distinct from those of other men, and

Who behav'd himself so acceptably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men, that as far as the times of <hi>Justinian</hi> the usual acclamation of the People at the Creation of an Emperour was this, <hi>Let him be more prosperous than</hi> Augustus <hi>and better than</hi> Trajan. He was of a temper so courteous and condescending in visiting the Sick, in saluting his Friends, in keeping Festivals, and being present at Collations to which he was invited, that the fault which some found with him for that very reason, gave the occasion of that worthy noble saying of his, <hi>That a Prince ought to be such to his Subjects, as he desires they should be to him.</hi> He impartially distributed Honours, Riches, and Rewards to all that deserved well; never oppress'd any man to fill his own Exchequer; granted advantageous immunities to poor Cities; repaired the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and made the passages of Rivers secure; made a high large Mole at the Haven of <hi>Ancona,</hi> to break the violence of the Waves; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed neither acted nor designed any thing in his whole life but what tended to the publick Good. Having gain'd such Renown both in War and in Peace, he died of a Flux, at <hi>Seleucia</hi> a City of <hi>Isauria,</hi> in the eighteenth year and sixth month of his Reign. His bones were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward convey'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there buried in an Urn of Gold, in the <hi>Forum</hi> which himself had built, under the winding Pillar of an hundred forty foot high, which is yet to beseen.</p>
               <p>But we return to <hi>Euaristus,</hi> who, as <hi>Damasus</hi> tells us, divided the City of <hi>Rome</hi> among the Presbyters into Parishes; ordained that seven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons should attend the Bishop when ever he preached to be witnesses of the truth of his Doctrine; and moreover that the accusation of a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should not be admitted against a Bishop. He held <hi>Decembrian</hi> Ordinations, at which he made six Presbyters, two Deacons and five Bishops. In his time lived <hi>Papias,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> an Auditor of<note place="margin">Papias.</note> 
                  <hi>John,</hi> a person who took not so much delight in the Records of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Disciples of our Lord, as in the living Conversation of <hi>Aristion</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the Elder. And it is manifest from the order he observes in setting down the names of these two after the mention of almost all the Apostles, that the <hi>John</hi> whom he places among the Apostles, was a distinct Person from this <hi>John</hi> the Aged, whom hereckons after <hi>Aristion.</hi> He was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very learned man, and followed by many, as particularly <hi>Irenaeus, Apollinarius, Tertullian, Victorinus Pictaviensis,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius Firmia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Now also <hi>Quadratus,</hi> a Disciple of the Apostles, did by his Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry<note place="margin">Quadratus.</note> and Courage support the Church of God as much as might be in

such dangerous times. For when <hi>Adrian,</hi> who now passed the Winter at <hi>Athens,</hi> and was admitted a Priest to the Goddess <hi>Eleusina,</hi> began to persecute the Christians, <hi>Quadratus</hi> with his own hand presented to him a very honest and rational Book of the Excellency of the Christian Religion. The like did <hi>Aristides,</hi> and <hi>Athenian</hi> Philosopher, converted to<note place="margin">Aristides:</note> Christianity; who at the same time with <hi>Quadratus,</hi> presented to <hi>Adrian</hi> a Treatise, containing an account of our Religion. The effect of which Apologeticks was, that <hi>Adrian</hi> being convinc'd of the injustice of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Christians to death without their being heard, wrote to <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Fundanus</hi> the Proconsul of <hi>Asia,</hi> ordering that no Christian should be executed, unless his guilt were proved by a credible Witness. As for our <hi>Euaristus,</hi> some tell us that he was martyr'd in the last year of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan;</hi> but they are more in the right, who are of opinion that he suffered under <hi>Adrian</hi> before his being reconciled to the Christians.

From the great benefits which the <hi>Roman</hi> State receiv'd by his Government, he was called the Father of his Countrey, and his Wife had the Title of <hi>Augusta.</hi> He was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well skil'd both in the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Languages, made many Laws, created a goodly Library at <hi>Athens,</hi> being mightily pleased with the Learning and Conversation of <hi>Plutarch, Sixtus, Agathocles</hi> and <hi>Oeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maus</hi> the Philosopher; and at the request of the <hi>Athenians</hi> compiled Laws for them according to the Model of <hi>Draco</hi> and <hi>Solen.</hi> Being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Eleusinian</hi> Mysteries, he was very bountiful to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of <hi>Athens,</hi> and repair'd their bridg broken down by an Innunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the River <hi>Cephysus.</hi> He built also a Bridg at <hi>Rome,</hi> called by his own name, remaining to this day, and a stately Sepulchre in the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> near the River <hi>Tyber,</hi> which the Popes now make use of for a Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. Moreover, he made that most sumptuous and stately <hi>Villa,</hi> now called <hi>Old Tiber,</hi> to the several parts of which he gave the names of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi> and the most celebrated parts of the World. Coming to <hi>Pelusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> he was at great expence in adorning <hi>Pompey'</hi>s Tomb, and in <hi>Britain</hi> he built a Wall of sixty miles to sever the <hi>Romans</hi> from the Natives. And because <hi>Septicius Clarus</hi> the Captain of his Guards, and <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> his Secretary, with several others, had without his leave conversed somewhat more familiarly with his Empress <hi>Sabina</hi> than the Reverence of a Court admitted of, he remov'd them all and put others into their Offices.</p>

               <p>But to return to our <hi>Alexander,</hi> He was the first who for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christs Passion at the Communion added those words, <hi>Qui pridie quam pateretur,</hi> to the Clause <hi>Hoc est corpus meum.</hi> He ordained likewise that the Holy Water (as it is called) mix'd with Salt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated by Prayer, should be kept in Churches and in private Houses, as a guard against evil Spirits. Moreover, he instituted that Water should be mingled with the Wine, at the consecration of the Elements, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Union of Christ with his Church; and that the Host should not be of leavened bread as was formerly used, but of unleavened only, as being the more pure, and by which all occasion of cavilling would be taken away from the <hi>Ebionite</hi> Hereticks, who were very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Judaism. In his time lived <hi>Agrippa Castor,</hi> who learnedly and<note place="margin">Agrippa Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor.</note> effectually confuted the books which <hi>Basilides</hi> the Heretick wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst<note place="margin">Bafilides.</note> the Holy Gospel; exposing to derision his Prophets <hi>Barcabas</hi> and <hi>Barthecab,</hi> and his great God <hi>Abraxas,</hi> names invented by him to amuse and terrifie the ignorant. This <hi>Basilides</hi> died at that time when the Christians were very much perfecuted and tormented by <hi>Cochebas,</hi> the Head of the Jewish Faction. But <hi>Adrian</hi> soon repress'd the pertinacy of this Rebel and the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> by an almost incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible slaughter of them; and then commanded that no <hi>Jew</hi> should be suffered to enter <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> permitting only Christians to inhabit that City, and having repaired the Walls and buildings of it, he called it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his own name <hi>Aelia; Marcus</hi> being after the expulsion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> chosen the first Gentile Bishop of it. In the time of this Bishop also <hi>Sapphira</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Sabina</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Lady suffer'd martyrdom for the faith of Christ; and <hi>Favorinus, Palaemon, Herodes Atheniensis</hi> and <hi>Marcus Byzantius</hi> were famous Rhetoricians. Our <hi>Alexander</hi> having at three <hi>Decembrian</hi> Ordinations made five Presbyters, three Deacons, five Bishops, was, together with his Deacons <hi>Euentius</hi> and <hi>Theodulus,</hi> crowned with Martyrdom, on the third day of <hi>May,</hi> and buried in the <hi>Via Nomentana,</hi> where he suffered, seven miles from the City.

                  <hi>SIXTUS</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> the Son of <hi>Pastor,</hi> or as others will have it, of <hi>Helvidius,</hi> held the Pontificate in the time of <hi>Adrian,</hi> to the Consulship of <hi>Verus</hi> and <hi>Anniculus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which <hi>Adrian</hi> is reckoned in the number of the good Emperours, upon the account of his Liberality, Splendour, Magnificence and Clemency; an eminent instance of the last of which good qualities was this, That when a Servant run madly upon him with his Sword, he took no farther notice of the Action than to order him a Physician to cure his Phrenzy. He visited the Sick twice or thrice in a day; at his own charge he repair'd <hi>Alexandria</hi> when it had been ruined by the <hi>Romans;</hi> he rebuilt the <hi>Pantheon</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> and made Aromatick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents

to the People. Being at the point of Death, he is said to have ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered these Verses;</p>

               <p>He died of a Dropsy in the two and twentieth year of his Reign, and was buried at <hi>Puteoli</hi> in <hi>Cicero'</hi>s <hi>Villa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtus</hi> out of his care of the Church, ordained, that the Elements and Vessels of the Altar should not be touched by any but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but especially not by Women; and that the <hi>Corporal,</hi> as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, should be made of Linnen-cloth only, and that of the finest sort. That no Bishop who had been cited to appear before the Apostolick See, should at his return be received by his Flock, unless he brought with him Letters Communicatory to the People. At the Celebration he instituted the Hymn, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth.</hi> Anciently the Office of the Communion was performed in a plain manner, and unclog'd with humane mixtures. St. <hi>Peter</hi> after Consecration used the <hi>Paternoster; James</hi> Bishop of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> added some Rites, <hi>Bazil</hi> more, and others more still. For <hi>Celestine</hi> brought in the <hi>Introitus</hi> of the Mass, <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Kyrie Eleyson, Telesphorus The Glory be to God on High, Gelasius the</hi> first the <hi>Collects,</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> the Epistle and Gospel. The <hi>Alelujah</hi> was taken from the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the <hi>Creed</hi> was instituted by the Council of <hi>Nice, Pelagius</hi> introduced the Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of the Dead, <hi>Leo</hi> the third the <hi>Incense, Innocent</hi> the first the <hi>Kiss of Peace,</hi> and <hi>Sergius</hi> ordered the <hi>Agnus Dei</hi> to be sung. During the time of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Persecution being so sharp, that few had courage enough to own the Profession of Christianity, and the Christian <hi>Gauls</hi> desiring a Bishop, to them he sends <hi>Peregrine</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> who having confirmed them in the Faith, at his return suffered Martyrdom in the <hi>Via Appia,</hi> at the place where Christ appeared to <hi>Peter</hi> as he was leaving the City. His body was by the faithful carried into the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> and buried near S. <hi>Peter. Aquila</hi> also by birth a <hi>Jew</hi> of <hi>Pontus,</hi> who with his Wife <hi>Priscilla</hi> had been banish'd by the Edict of <hi>Claudius,</hi> is said by some to have lived till this time; he was the second Translatour of the Old Testament, after the Seventy who lived in the time of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomey Philadelphus.</hi> As for <hi>Sixtus,</hi> having at three <hi>Decembrian</hi> Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, made eleven Presbyters, eleven Deacons, and four Bishops, he was crowned with Martyrdom, and buried in the <hi>Vatican</hi> near St. <hi>Peter,</hi> having been in the Chair ten years, three months, and one and twenty days. Upon his Death the See was vacant only two days.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Antoninus Pius.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This Emperour was by his Fathers side a <hi>Cisalpine Gaul,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Sons <hi>Aurelius</hi> and <hi>Verus,</hi> he ruled twenty two years and three months with so much moderation and Clemency that he deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gain'd the name of <hi>Pius,</hi> and Father of his Countrey. He was never severe or rigorous towards any man in the recovery of his own private Debts, or the exaction of publick Taxes, but would sometimes wholly remit them by burning the Bonds of his Debtors. What shall I need say more of this Prince, who in the opinion of all good men was for Religion, Devotion, Humanity, Clemency, Justice, and Modesty equal to <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> himself. When the River <hi>Tiber</hi> had by an inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion much impaired many private and publick buildings, he was at vast expence to assist the Citizens in restoring the City to its former state again. Moreover, it was he who carried on those prodigious Works which appear to this day, for improving the Havens of <hi>Tarracina</hi> and <hi>Cajeta;</hi> and I believe that the famous winding Pillar, from which the principal Ward of the City is denominated, was built at his charge.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>Telesphorus,</hi> he ordained that a <hi>Quadragesimal</hi> Fast should be observed before <hi>Easter;</hi> and that on the Feast of the Nativity of our Lord there should be three Masses; one at Midnight, at which time Christ was born in <hi>Bethelehem,</hi> another at break of Day when he was discovered to the Shepherds, the third at that hour wherein the light of Truth and our Redemption shone in the World (<hi>i. e.</hi> when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was crucified) whereas at other times the celebration of the Mass was forbidden till the third hour, or between the hours of nine and twelve a Clock, the time when, as St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, he was fastned to the Cross. He also appointed that the Hymn, <hi>Glory be to God on High,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</note> should be sung before the Sacrifice. In his time <hi>Justinus,</hi> a Philosopher of <hi>Neapolis</hi> a City of <hi>Palestine,</hi> labour'd successfully in the defending Christianity; presented to <hi>Antoninus</hi> and his Sons a book which he had written against the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and held a Dialogue with <hi>Tryphon</hi> a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Jew.</hi> He wrote also very warmly against <hi>Marcion,</hi> who adhering to the Heresie of <hi>Cerdo,</hi> affirmed that there were two Gods, the one good, the other just, as two contrary principles of Creation and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. He opposed likewise <hi>Crescens</hi> the Cynick, as a person glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, fearful of Death, given over to Luxury and lust, and a blasphemer of Christ. But being at length by this mans treacherous practices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd, he suffered in the cause of Christianity <hi>Eusebius</hi> writing of this Cynick, allows him only to have been a vain-glorious Pretender, but not a Philosopher. At the same time the <hi>Valentinian</hi> Hereticks prevail'd, who were the followers of one <hi>Valentinus</hi> a Platonist; and held that Christ took nothing of the body of the Virgin, but passed clean through her, as through a Pipe. Now also <hi>Photinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> a man of singular Learning and Piety, as <hi>Isidore</hi> tells us, suffered Martyrdom with great resolution, being ninety years old. <hi>Telesphorus</hi> having at four

                  </gap> I come to give an account of <hi>Hyginus.</hi> He was so far from the vanity of valuing himself upon the glory of his Arms, that he made it his business rather to defend the Provinces of the Empire, than to encrease them; and had often that saying of <hi>Scipio</hi> in his mouth, <hi>that he had rather save one Citizen than destroy a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Enemies:</hi> being herein of a quite contrary temper to that of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian,</hi> who from a consciousness of his own cruelty did so hate and fear a multitude, that he would expose the <hi>Roman</hi> Army to the fury of its Enemies, on purpose that it might return home thinner and less formidable. Moreover, <hi>Pius</hi> was so famous for his Justice, that seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes and Nations did at his Command cease their Hostilities, making him the Arbitratour of their differences, and standing to his determination as to the Justice of their Pretensions. For these admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable qualities, the <hi>Romans</hi> after his much lamented death, in honor to his memory, appointed Cirque-shews, built a Temple, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <p>At this time <hi>Hyginus</hi> prudently setled and confirm'd the several Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Degrees of the Clergy; and ordain'd the Solemn Consecration of Churches, the number of which he would not have encreas'd or diminish'd without leave of the Metropolitan or Bishop. He forbad also that the Timber or other Materials prepared for the building any Church, should be converted to prophane uses; yet allowing that with the Bishop's consent, they might be made use of towards the erecting any other Church or Religious House. He likewise ordained that at least one Godfather or one Godmother should be present at Baptism; and that no Metropolitan should condemn or censure any Bishop of his Province, until the cause were first heard and discussed by the other Bishops of the Province; though some make this latter an Institution of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> not <hi>Hyginus.</hi> In his time lived <hi>Polycarp,</hi> a Disciple of St.<note place="margin">Polycarp.</note> 
                  <hi>John</hi> the Apostle, and by him made Bishop of <hi>Smyrna;</hi> the most cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated man for Religion and learning in all <hi>Asia.</hi> He coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> reduc'd to the Orthodox Faith multitudes who had been seduc'd into the Errours of <hi>Marcion</hi> and <hi>Valentinus;</hi> the former of which by chance meeting him, and asking <hi>whether he knew him; Polycarp</hi> answered, <hi>that he knew him to be the first-born of the Devil.</hi> For this Heretick denied the Father of our blessed Saviour to be God the Creatour, who by his Son made the World. But afterwards in the time of <hi>M. Antoninus,</hi> and <hi>L. Aurclius Commodus,</hi> who raised the fourth Persecution, <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50681:28"/>

Moreover, <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> wrote a book against the Heresie of <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> who asserted an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created eternal matter, co-eval to God himself.

                  </note> it with such admirable courage and success, that they had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Triumph decreed to them. But not long after <hi>Commodus</hi> dying of an Apoplexy, <hi>Antoninus</hi> was sole Emperour; a person who so excell'd in all good qualities, that it is more easie to admire than to describe him; for both because from his very youth no change of his Fortune made any alteration in his mind or his countenance, and because it is hard to determine whether the sweetness of his natural temper, or the knowledg he learnt from <hi>Cornelius Fronto,</hi> were more conspicuous in him, he deservedly gain'd the surname of <hi>Philosopher.</hi> And indeed (as <hi>Capitolinus</hi> tells us) he was often wont to use that saying of <hi>Plato, That then the World would be happy, when either Philosophers were Princes, or Princes would be Philosophers.</hi> He was so great a lover of Learning, that even when he was Emperour he would be present at the Lectures of <hi>Apollonius</hi> the Philosopher, and <hi>Sextus Plutarch'</hi>s Nephew; and he set up the Statue of his Tutour <hi>Fronto</hi> in the Senate-house as a Testimony of the Honour he had for him.</p>
               <p>At this time <hi>Pius</hi> maintain'd a strict friendship and familiarity with <hi>Hermes</hi> who wrote the book called <hi>Pastor;</hi> in which book he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces<note place="margin">Hermes.</note> an Angel in the form of a Shepherd. who commanded him to persuade all Christians to keep the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> on a Sunday, which <hi>Pius</hi> accordingly did. Moreover, he ordained that every Convert from the <hi>Cerinthian</hi> Heresie should at his reception into the Church be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. At the request of <hi>Praxedes</hi> a devout Woman, he dedicated a Church at the Baths of <hi>Novatus</hi> to her Sister S. <hi>Pudentiana;</hi> to which himself made several donations, oftentimes celebrated Maſs in it, and built a Font which he blessed and consecrated, and at which he baptized a great number of Proselytes. He also appointed a punishment upon those who were negligent in handling the body and blood of Christ. If through the Priests carelesness any of the Cup had fallen upon the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50681:28"/>
ground, he was to undergo a Penance of forty days; if it fell upon the Altar, of three days; if upon the Altar-cloth, of four days; it upon any other Cloth, of nine days. Whithersoever it fell, he was to lick it up if he could, if not, the board or stone to be wash'd or scraped, and what of it could be recovered thereby either burnt or laid up in the Sacrary. In his time <hi>Apollinaris</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hierapolis</hi> in <hi>Asia</hi> was much esteem'd,<note place="margin">Apollinaris.</note> who wrote an excellent Apology for Christianity, and presented it to <hi>Antoninus</hi> the second. He wrote also against the <hi>Montanists,</hi> who with their two fanatick Prophetesses <hi>Priſcillia</hi> and <hi>Maximilla,</hi> pretended that the descent of the Holy Ghost was not upon the Apostles, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; an opinion which they had learn'd from their Leader <hi>Montanus.</hi> At this time also the learned <hi>Tatianus</hi> was in good reputation, so long<note place="margin">Tatianus.</note> as he swerved not from the Doctrine of his Master <hi>Justin Martyr;</hi> but afterwards being puff'd up with a great conceit of himself, he became the Author of a new Heresie, which being propagated by one <hi>Severus,</hi> the followers of it were from him called <hi>Severians.</hi> They drank no Wine, ate no Flesh, rejected the Old Testament, and believed not the Resurrection. Moreover, <hi>Philip</hi> Bishop of <hi>Crete</hi> now published an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent book against <hi>Marcion</hi> and his followers, whose Errours were the same with those of <hi>Cerdo. Musanus</hi> also wrote a book against the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks called <hi>Encratitoe,</hi> or the <hi>Abstemious,</hi> who agreed in opinion with the <hi>Severians,</hi> looking upon all carnal copulation as filthy and unclean, and condemning those Meats which God hath given for the use of mankind. But to return to <hi>Pius,</hi> having at five <hi>Decembrian</hi> Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, made nineteen Presbyters, twenty one Deacons, ten Bishops, he died and was buried in the <hi>Vatican</hi> near S. <hi>Peter, July</hi> 11.

The truth of which the Emperour himself testified by his Letters. But at his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> he utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced all Virtue and goodness, and shamefully gave himself up to all manner of Luxury and uncleanness. He used, in imitation of <hi>Nero,</hi> to combat with the Gladiators, and oftentimes encountred with wild beasts in the Amphitheatre; many of the Senatours he put to death, and those especially whom he observed to be more conspicuous for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction or merit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Soter</hi> diverting his mind from the contemplation of this wretched Scene of things to the care of Ecclesiastical affairs, decreed, That no Deaconess should touch the Altar-cloth, or put the Incense upon the Censer, at the time of celebration. There is extant an Epistle of his concerning that matter, written to the Bishops of <hi>Italy.</hi> He ordained likewise that no Woman should be accounted a lawful Wife, but she whom the Priest had formally blessed, and whom her Parents had with the usual Christian solemnities given to her Husband. This Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he made, to remove the danger and scandal that was incident to new-married persons, from the jugling Magical tricks of lewd Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. Indeed, <hi>Gratian</hi> ascribes this Decree to <hi>Euaristus,</hi> but whose due it is I leave the Reader to judg, for it matters not much whether it be attributed to the one or the other. During the Pontificat of <hi>Soter,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us, lived <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Corinth,</hi> a person of so great parts and Industry, that he instructed not only the people of his own City and Province, but also by his Epistles the Bishops of other Cities and Provinces, For being throughly acquainted with the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he could the more easily keep others within the bounds of their duty by the Authority which his Learning and Sanctity had gained him. <hi>

Not long after another Fire brake forth, in which the Temple of <hi>Vesta,</hi> the Palace, and a good part of the City were burnt to the ground. He was of so rash and freakish a humour, that he caused the Head of a vast <hi>Colosse</hi> to be taken off, and that of his own Statue to be placed in the room of it; and in imitation of <hi>Augustus,</hi> he would needs have a month of his own name, ordering <hi>December</hi> to be called <hi>Commodus.</hi> But these things were soon changed after his Death, and himself adjudged an Enemy to mankind, such an hatred and detestation did all men entertain of his Villanies.

Hereupon <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> sends <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> two very religious men, to that Island to baptize the King and his People; there were at that time in <hi>Britain</hi> twenty five Heathen Priests called <hi>Flamens,</hi> and among them three sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Arch-flamens,</hi> in the place of which, as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> says, were constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted three Arch-bishops; the ancient Church being wont to fix Patriarchs there, where in the time of Gentilism Proto-flamens had been seated. Furthermore, <hi>Eleutherius</hi> ordained that no person should superstitiously abstain from any sort of meat which was commonly eaten: and that no Clergy-man should be degraded before he were legally found guilty of the Crime laid to his Charge; following herein the Example of our Saviour, who so patiently bore the fault of <hi>Judas,</hi> being not yet convicted, though really guilty, that whatsoever he acted in the mean time by virtue of his Apostleship, remained firm and valid. He also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the passing sentence against any person accused, unless he were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to make his defence; which was afterwards confirmed by <hi>Damasus</hi> and the Pontifical Laws. In his Pontificate the Church enjoy'd peace and tranquility, and Christianity was wonderfully propagated in the World, but especially at <hi>Rome,</hi> where many of the best quality with their Wives and Children received the Faith and were baptized.

For the Sect of the <hi>Marcionites</hi> was divided into several Parties; some of them owning but one Principle, or God; others two; others three; thereby utterly undermining the credit of the Prophets and other discoverers of revealed Religion. Moreover <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> and <hi>Blastus</hi> set up new Figments against the Truth, asserting God to be the Author of all kinds of evil, in contradiction to that Text, that <hi>every thing which God made was good.</hi> Opposite to these<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> were the <hi>Quotiliani,</hi> who denied God to be the author of any kind of evil, in equal contradiction to that other Text, <hi>I the Lord create evil.</hi>

He was so upright in all his dealings, that no man could ever complain of any Injury receiv'd from him: and so far removed from any kind of Vanity or Ostentation, that he appear'd but once in the costly Robes belonging to his Office, while he was Consul. All those who in their Addresses to him were sneakingly obsequious in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, or affectedly complaisant in their words, he would reject as fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fellows; for he was so wise and discerning that no man could im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose upon him; one instance of which was his proceeding with <hi>Turi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> to whom, for his taking Bribes upon the appearance of his being the Emperours mighty Favourite, he allotted this remarkable punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that being bound to a Stake in the Transitory <hi>Forum,</hi> a place of greatest Concourse, and the most publick thorow-fare, he should be suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with smoak; the common Cryer in the mean time proclaiming these words, <hi>He that sold smoak, is punish'd with smoak.</hi> Though his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mammoea,</hi> as she was a Woman, had a great love for Money, yet he was altogether above it; and for Jewels, he slighted them, as femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Trifles, being often wont to say, that in <hi>Virgil</hi> (whom he called the <hi>Plato</hi> of the Poets) there were more, and more precious Gems to be found.

Having after great search gotten a Collection of the Images of Famous Men, he caus'd them to be set up in the Transitory <hi>Forum;</hi> and likewise finish'd and beautified those which are at this time call'd the <hi>Antonian Baths,</hi> having been begun by <hi>Antoninus Caracalla.</hi> He had it in his design to acknowledg our Saviour to be a God, and build a Temple to him; and did actually set up the Effigies of Christ and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and <hi>Orpheus</hi> in his Domestick Chappel.

He ordered likewise that no Bishop should be translated from his first Bishoprick to another for his private Need or Benefit, but only for the sake of the Flock committed to him, and by the leave of the Supreme Bishop. A Constitution which at this day is made void by common Practice; for now the Prelates being intent upon their own Profit and Pleasure, are always looking out for a fatter; Not that they are at all inquisitive how they may feed a larger Flock, but the great Enquiry is, how much any See may be made worth yearly.

                  <hi>FELIX,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> Son of <hi>Constantinus,</hi> lived in the time of <hi>Aurelianus,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who came to the Empire <hi>A.U.C.</hi> 1027, and being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent<note place="margin">Aurelianus.</note> Soldier gain'd a great Victory over the <hi>Goths</hi> at the River <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now.</hi> From thence passing into <hi>Asia,</hi> at a place not far from <hi>Antioch,</hi> by the terrour of his name rather than by fighting, he overcame <hi>Zenobia,</hi> who from the time that her Husband <hi>Odenatus</hi> had been slain was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire. Her he led in Triumph together with <hi>Tetricus,</hi> by his defeating of whom at <hi>Chaalons, Gallia</hi> was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Yet by the Humanity and Clemency of <hi>Aurelianus, Zenobia</hi> lived all her time very honourably in the City, from whom the <hi>Zeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Family in <hi>Rome</hi> derives its Original; and <hi>Tetricus</hi> being saved, was afterwards made Governour of the <hi>Lucani.</hi> The Emperour now applying himself to works of peace, repaired the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the Walls of the City with great Magnificence. But not long after raising the ninth Persecution against the Christians, the divine Vengeance meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, he was slain at a small Fort between <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Heraclea,</hi> called <hi>Zenophrurium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Felix</hi> out of the great regard he had to the honour of the Martyrs, ordained, that upon their account Masses should be celebrated yearly; and that the Sacrifice of the Mass should be celebrated by no other persons but such as were in holy Orders, and in no places but such as were consecrated, cases of necessity being always excepted. But if through the age or loss of Records it were doubtsul concerning any Church whether it had been consecrated or no, he commanded that it should be consecrated anew; saying, that nothing could properly be said to be repeated, of which it is uncertain whether ever it were once done at all. During his Pontificate one <hi>Manes</hi> a <hi>Persian,</hi> had the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence<note place="margin">Manes.</note> to profess himself to be the Christ, and that he might gain the greater credit to his Imposture, he associated to himself twelve Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. But as that <hi>Manes</hi> was detested and abhorred for his pride and blasphemy, so <hi>Anatolius</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Laodicoea</hi> was as much extolled and magnified for his Religion and Learning.

               <p>
                  <hi>Eutychianus</hi> ordained, that the fruits of the Earth, as Beans and Grapes, &amp;c. should be blessed upon the Altar; and also that no persons should bury the Martyrs in any but Purple Vestments; unless with his knowledg and leave. Some write that in his time <hi>Dorotheus</hi> the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch<note place="margin">Dorotheus.</note> flourished, a man questionless of very great skill in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language; and with whose Learning 'tis said, the Emperour <hi>Aurelianus</hi> was wonderfully delighted. For in the beginning of his Reign he was such a Favourer of the Christians, that he severely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured the Sect of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus.</hi> But being afterwards corrupted by evil Counsels; and, as hath been said, raising a Persecution against the Christians, having sent Dispatches concerning that Affair to the several Governours of Provinces, he was cut off by the Divine Hand. <hi>Eusebius</hi> when he was young was an Auditor of <hi>Dorotheus</hi> at his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of Scripture. At this time also <hi>Anatolius</hi> an <hi>Alexandrian,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop<note place="margin">Anatolius.</note> of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> a man of great Learning, wrote several excellent things in Mathematicks and Divinity; and was very severe against the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choean</hi> Heresie which then very much prevailed. These <hi>Manichees</hi> to their other Errours, brought in two Substances, the one good, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evil, and held that Souls flowed from God, as from a Fountain. The Old Testament they all together disown'd, and receiv'd but some parts of the New.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eutychianus,</hi> after that at several Ordinations, he had consecrated four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Presbyters, five Deacons, nine Bishops, was crowned with Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and buried in the Coemetery of <hi>Calistus, July</hi> the 25th. He sat in the Chair one year, one month, one day; and by his death theSee was vacant eight days. There are some who say he lived in the Pontificate eight years, ten months; but I rather give credit to <hi>Damasus,</hi> who is the author of the former Assertion.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50681:40"/>
sword, and several others to be thrown alive into the flames. The same severity was exercised against them in <hi>Mitylene, Syria, Africa, Thebais,</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> by the several Governours of those Provinces, and in <hi>Palestine</hi> and <hi>Tyre</hi> great numbers of them were expos'd to be devoured by wild beasts. Indeed there was no kind of Torment could be invented which the Christians did not undergo. Some had their flesh scraped and torn off with Potsherds, to others sharp Reeds were thrust under their Nails, and to the Women run up into their privities. A certain City in <hi>Phrygia</hi> was set on fire and burnt to the ground, because the Citizens, who were kept constant to the Faith by <hi>Adauctus</hi> a pious <hi>Roman,</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to offer sacrifice to Idols. In the end their inhuman Tormentors came to such a height of Cruelty, that they would first burn out their Eyes with searing Irons, and then wreak the remainder of their fury and rage against them. At this time were also put to death for the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christianity <hi>Anthimus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and <hi>Lucianus</hi> the Learned Presbyter of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Pamphilus</hi> of <hi>Coesarea,</hi> and <hi>Philoeas</hi> an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> and Bishop of <hi>Thmyis;</hi> this last being beheaded, because he had written a Book in praise of the Martyrs, and had courage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to tell his unjust Judges their own. I need not enumerate more Instances, since <hi>Damasus</hi> affirms, that there were no less than seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thousand persons of both Sexes who suffered Martyrdom through the several Provinces in the space of thirty days. I shall not mention those who were banish'd to the Islands, or condemn'd to work in the the Mines or melting-Houses, or to dig Sand, or to hew Stones, or to other the like kinds of Servitude, whose numbers were almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> being carried to the Heathen Sacrifices, and his Tormentors with menaces urging him to offer, he being overcome with fear submitted to their importunities, and joyn'd with them in their Idolatries. But not long after a Council of an hundred and eighty Bishops being held at <hi>Sinuessa</hi> a City of <hi>Campania,</hi> thither goes <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> cloth'd in Sackcloth, with all the marks of an humble penitent, and beseeches them to inflict upon him the just punishment of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize and inconstancy. Yet in so numerous a Council there was not a man who would pass any Sentence against him, they all agreeing that he had laps'd only after the same manner that S. <hi>Peter</hi> himself did, and that by his tears and sorrows he had already sufficiently suffered for his Fault. To <hi>Rome</hi> returns <hi>Marcellinus</hi> full of Resentment, hastens to <hi>Diocletian,</hi> and boldly reproves him for causing him to sacrifice to false Gods. Hereupon, by <hi>Diocletian'</hi>s order he was forthwith led to Execution, together with <hi>Claudius, Cyrinus,</hi> and <hi>Antoninus,</hi> three other assertors of Christianity. As he went along, he admonished <hi>Marcellus</hi> his Presbyter not to submit to the command of <hi>Diocletian</hi> in matters appertaining to Religion; and forbad him to suffer his Body to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, saying, that since he had denied his Saviour, he was unworthy of the least acts of Humanity. Though indeed by <hi>Diocletians</hi> order the bodies of all these four Martyrs lay unburied in the High-way the space of thirty six days. Afterwards at the Command of S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle, who appeared to <hi>Marcellus</hi> in a Dream, they were buried in the <hi>Via <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It would be to no purpose for me to mention the great Covetousness of the Clergy, especially of those who are in Authority; their Lust, their Ambition, their Pomp, their Pride, their Idleness, their Ignorance of themselves and of the Doctrine of Christianity, their little Piety, and that rather seign'd than true, and their great Debauchery, so great that it would be abominable even in the prophane (for so they superciliously call the Laicks;) this I say, it would be to no purpose for me to tell, since they themselves do avow their sins so openly, that one would think they judg'd Vice to be a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable quality, and expected to gain Reputation by it.

                  <hi>SYLVESTER,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> was Bishop in the time of <hi>Constantine, A. V, C.</hi> 1091. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 339.</p>
               <p>Under this Prince the Christians, who had been continually harrassed by Tyrants, began to have some respite. For <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Constantine.</note> was equal to the best of Princes in all endowments of Body and Mind, very desirous of Military Glory, successful in War, and yet freely granting Peace to them who asked it. When his other great Affairs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he took very much delight in the study of the Arts; by his Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Goodness he gained the love of all men; many good Laws he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, repeal'd those that were superfluous, and moderated those that were too rigorous. Upon the Ruines of <hi>Byzantium</hi> he built a City of his own Name, and endeavouring to make it equal in stateliness of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50681:43"/>
buildings to <hi>Rome</hi> her self, he ordered it to be called <hi>New Rome,</hi> as appears from the Inscription under his Statue on Horse-back.</p>
               <p>This great Prince well weighing and considering all things, when he came to understand the Excellency of the Christian Religion, how it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges men to be moderate in their Enjoyments, to rejoyce in poverty, to be gentle and peaceable, sincere and constant, &amp;c. he thereupon heartily imbraced it; and when he undertook any War, bore no other Figure on his Standard but that of the Cross, the form of which he had seen in the Air as he was advancing with his Forces against <hi>Maxentius,</hi> and had heard the Angels near it saying to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> by this do thou overcome; which accordingly he did, freeing the necks of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Christians from the Yoke of Tyranny, and particularly defeating <hi>Licinius,</hi> who had expell'd the Christians from City and Camp, and persecuted them with banishment, Imprisonment, and Death it self; exposing some of them to the Lions, and causing others to be hung up and cut to pieces limb by limb like dead Swine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylvester</hi> having so potent and propitious a Prince on his side, leaves the Mountain <hi>Soracte,</hi> whither he had been banished by the Tyrants, or, as some say had voluntarily retired, and comes to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he soon prevailed with <hi>Constantine,</hi> who was before well enclined towards the Christians, to be now very zealous in deserving well of the Church. For as a particular testimony of the honour he had for the Clergy, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> the use of a Diadem of Gold set with precious Stones. But this <hi>Sylvester</hi> declined, as not suiting a person de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to Religion, and therefore contented himself with a white <hi>Phrygian</hi> Mitre. <hi>Constantine</hi> being highly affected with <hi>Sylvesters</hi> Sanctity, built a Church in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Gardens of <hi>Equitius,</hi> not far from <hi>Domitians</hi> Baths, which bore the name of <hi>Equitius</hi> till the time of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masus.</hi> Upon this Church the munificent Emperour conferr'd several donations of Vessels both of Gold and Silver, and likewise very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endowed it.</p>
               <p>While these things were transacting at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> a certain<note place="margin">Arius.</note> Presbyter named <hi>Arius,</hi> (a man more remarkable for his Person, than the inward qualifications of his mind, and who sought more eagerly after Fame and vain-glory than after Truth,) began to sow dissention in the Church. For he endeavoured to separate the Son from the Eternal and ineffable Substance of God the Father, by affirming that there was a time when he was not; not understanding that the Son was Co-eternal with the Father, and of the same substance with him, according to that assertion of his in the Gospel, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> Now <hi>Alexander</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> having in vain attempted to reclaim <hi>Arius</hi> from this his Errour, by <hi>Constantines</hi> Appointment, and at his great Charge,<note place="margin">The Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>
                  </note> a General Council was called at <hi>Nicoea</hi> a City of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> at which three hundred and eighteen Bishops were present. The Debates on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side were long and warm. For divers persons subtil at Arguing, were favourers of <hi>Arius,</hi> and opposers of the simplicity of the Gospel; though one of these a very learned Philosopher, being inwardly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Divine Spirit, all on a sudden changed his opinion, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately embraced the sound and Orthodox Doctrine which before he had pleaded against. At length the matter being throughly discuss'd in the Council, it was concluded that the Son should be styled <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:50681:44"/>
acknowledg'd to be of the same substance with the Father. Of those who were of <hi>Arius'</hi>s Opinion, affirming the Son of God to be created, not begotten of the very Divinity of the Father, there were seventeen. But <hi>Constantine,</hi> coming to understand the truth of the Controversie, confirmed the Decree of the Council, and denounc'd the punishment of Exile to those who contradicted it. Hereupon <hi>Arius</hi> with only six more wer banish'd, the rest of his Party coming over to the Orthodox Opinion. In this Council the <hi>Photinians</hi> were condemned, who had<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Photinians</hi> and <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians.</hi>
                  </note> their name from <hi>Photinus</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Gallogroecia,</hi> who taking up the Heresie of the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> held that Christ was conceived of <hi>Mary</hi> by the ordinary way of generation; as were likewise the <hi>Sabellians,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that the Father, Son, and holy Ghost were but one Person. In this Council also, the Bishops according to Custom, gave in Bills of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to <hi>Constantine,</hi> wherein they accused each other, and desired Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice from him; but the good Emperour burnt all their Accusations, and told them, that they must stand or fall by the Judgment of God only, and not of men. In this Council moreover it was decreed. That no person who upon pretence of allaying the heat of his Lust had castrated himself, should be admitted into Orders; that no new Proselyte, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a very strict Examination should be ordained, and being so, that it should not be lawful for him to co-habit with any other Women than his Mother, or Sister, or Aunt; that none should be promoted to the Order of a Bishop, unless by all or at least by three Bishops of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and that one Bishop should not receive any person whether Clerk or Laick who stood excommunicated by another. It was decreed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and that very sacredly to prevent all oppression, that there should be a Provincial Synod held every year, whither any who thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves injured by the Bishop might appeal; and I cannot see why this wholsom Institution should be abolished by the Prelates of our Age, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be because they dread the Censures of the pious and Orthodox. It was decreed also, that they who in time of Persecution fell away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were brought to the Torture, should from thenceforward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue five years among the <hi>Catechumens.</hi> Finally, it was decreed, that no Bishop should upon the account of Ambition or Covetousness leave a smaller Church for a greater; a Canon which is quite laid aside in our days, wherein with eager Appetites like hungry Wolves they all gape af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fatter Bishopricks, using all importunities, promises, and bribes to get them. The Constitutions of <hi>Sylvester</hi> himself were reckon'd these that follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That the holy Oyl should be consecrated by the Bishop only; that none but Bishops should have the power of Confirmation, but a Presbyter might anoint any person baptized upon the occasion of imminent death. That no Laick should commence a Suit against a Clergyman; that a Deacon while he was doing his Office in the Church should use a Cope with Sleeves; that no Clergyman should plead for others or himself before a Secular Judg. That a Presbyter should not consecrate the Elements upon a Pall of Silk or dyed Cloth, but only upon white Linnen, for the nearer resemblance of the fine white Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen in which the Body of Christ was buried. He also fix'd the several degrees in the Orders of the Church, that every one might act in his own sphere, and be the Husband of one Wife. But <hi>Constantine</hi> being desirous to promote the Christian Religion, built the <hi>Constantinian</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50681:44"/>
Church (called the <hi>Lateran</hi>) which he beautified and enriched with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great Donations, the Ornaments and Endowments which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon it, being of a vast value. Among other things, he set up in it a Font of <hi>Porphyry</hi>-stone, that part of it which contains the Water, being all Silver; in the middle of the Font was placed a Pillar of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry,</hi> on the top of which stood a golden Lamp full of the most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Oyl, which was wont to burn in the night during the <hi>Easter</hi> Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. On the edge or brink of it stood a Lamb of pure Gold, through which the Water was conveyed into it; not far from the Lamb was the Statue of our Saviour of most pure Silver. On the other side stood the Image of <hi>John Baptist</hi> of Silver likewise, with an Inscription of these words, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the World.</hi> There were besides seven Harts placed round about it and pouring Water into it. For the maitenance of this Font he gave several Estates in Land and Houses. Moreover <hi>Constantine</hi> at the motion of <hi>Sylvester</hi> built and dedicated a Church to S. <hi>Peter</hi> the chief of the Apostles, in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> not far from the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> where he very splendidly reposited the body of that Apostle, and covered his Tomb over with Brass and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. This Church likewise he magnificently adorn'd, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> largely endow'd. The same Emperour also at the instance of <hi>Sylvester</hi> built a Church, which he enriched and endowed as he had done the former, in the <hi>Via Ostiensis,</hi> in honour to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whose body he entomb'd after the same manner with that of S. <hi>Peter;</hi> By his order also a Church was built in the <hi>Sessorian Atrium,</hi> by the name of <hi>S. Cross</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> wherein he reposited a part of the holy Cross which was found out by his Mother <hi>Helena</hi> a Lady of ineomparable Piety and Devotion. Who,<note place="margin">Inventio Cric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</note> being promted thereto partly by the greatness of her own mind, and partly by Visions in the Night, went to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to seek after the Cross upon which Christ was crucified. To find it was a very difficult task, because the ancient Persecutors had set up the Image of <hi>Venus</hi> in the same place, that so the Christians might by mistake worship her in stead of their Saviour. But <hi>Helena</hi> being animated with Zeal, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on to dig and remove the rubbish till at last she found three Crosses ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confusedly one among another; on one of which was this Inscription in three Languages, <hi>Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. Macarius,</hi> the Bishop of that City was at first mistaken in his opinion which was the right; but at length all doubt concerning it was removed by an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment upon the body of a dead Woman, who was raised to life at the application of the true one. From the sense of so great a Miracle, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> publish'd an Edict, forbidding any Malefactor to be from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward punish'd by Crucifiction. <hi>Helena</hi> having first built a Church upon the ground where this Cross was found, return'd, and brought the Nails with which our Saviours body was fastned to it, as a present to her Son. Of one of those Nails he caused to be made the bit of the bridle with which he manag'd the Horse he us'd in War, the other he wore on the Crest of his Helmet, and the third he threw into the <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Sea to suppress the rage and tempestuousness of it. That part of the Cross which the devout Lady brought along with her in a Silver Case set with Gold and precious Stones, was placed in this <hi>Sessorian</hi> Church. To which <hi>Constantine</hi> was very liberal and munificent. Some tell us, that the Church of S. <hi>Agnes</hi> was built at <hi>Constantin'</hi>s Command, upon the request of his Daughter <hi>Constantia,</hi> and a Font set up in it, where both
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50681:45"/>
his Daughter and his Sister of the same name, were baptized, and which in like manner he largely presented and endowed. The same Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour built also the Church of S. <hi>Laurence</hi> without the Walls, towards which he was not wanting to express his usual Beneficence. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Besides these Churches in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> he built several others also elsewhere. At <hi>Ostia</hi> not far from the Port, he built a Church in honour to S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the blessed, Apostles and <hi>John Baptist;</hi> near <hi>Alba</hi> he built a Church peculiarly dedicated to <hi>

Besides all the foregoing instances of <hi>Constantine'</hi>s Munificence, he distributed moreover among the Provincial Churches and the Clergy a certain Tribute or Custom due to him from the several Cities, which Donation he made valid and perpetuated by an Imperial Edict. And that Virgins and those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in <hi>Celibacy,</hi> might be enabled to make Wills, and so to bequeath by Testament something to the Clergy, (from whence I believe the Patrimony of the Church to have received a great encrease) he repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Law which had been made for the propagating of mankind, by which any Person was rendred uncapable of entring upon an Estate who had lived unmarried till five and twenty years of Age; a Law upon which the Princes had founded their <hi>Jus trium liberorum,</hi> the Right or Priviledg of having three Children, of which they often took advantage against those who had no Issue. All these things are exactly and fully delivered to us by <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Zozomen</hi> the Historians. In the time of <hi>Sylvester</hi> flourished several persons of extraordinary Note, by whose labour and industry many Countreys and Nations were converted to Christianity, and particularly by the preaching of <hi>Julianus, Frumentius</hi> and <hi>Edisius,</hi> whom certain Philosophers of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had carried thither. The <hi>Iberi</hi> also a remote People were brought to the knowledg and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief Christianity a certain Captive Woman, through the Assistance and Persuasion of their King <hi>Bacurius.</hi> At this time likewise the Authority of <hi>Antony</hi> the holy Hermite did much towards the Reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;<note place="margin">Anthony</note> 
                  <hi>Helena</hi> did oftentimes both by Letter and Messengers recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend<note place="margin">Hermite.</note> her self and her Sons to his Prayers; he was by Countrey an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> his manner of living severe and abstemious, eating only Bread and drinking nothing but Water, and never making any Meal but about Sun-set; a man wholly rapt up in Contemplation. His Life was written at large by <hi>Athanasius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> As for <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vester</hi> himself, having at seven <hi>Decembrian</hi> Ordinations made forty two Presbyters, thirty six Deacons, sixty five Bishops, he dyed and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

                  <hi>MARCUS,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> Son of <hi>Priscus,</hi> lived also in the Reign of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, concerning whom Historians differ in their Writings.</p>
               <p>For some affirm, that <hi>Constantine</hi> towards the latter end of his Reign, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called <hi>Arius</hi> from banishment, and became a favourer of his Heresy through the persuasion of his Sister who always insisted, that it was nothing but Envy that had caused his Condemnation. These I believe to be deceiv'd by the nearness of their names, and so to ascribe that to the Father which was the act of the Son. For it is not probable that that wise Prince, who had all along before disapprov'd of the <hi>Arian</hi> opinion, should now begin to incline to it in that part of his Age wherein men are usually most judicious and discerning. They write moreover, that <hi>Constantine</hi> was baptized by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> an <hi>Arian,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nicomedia.</hi> But that this is a mistake appears both from the Emperours great bounty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Orthodox, and also from that stately Font upon that occasion erected with wonderful Magnificence at <hi>Rome;</hi> at which after he had been successful in expelling the Tyrants, he, with his Son <hi>Crispus,</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Faith and baptized by <hi>Sylvester.</hi> They who are of the other opinion tell us, that <hi>Constantine</hi> deferred so great an Affair till the time that he might come to the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> in which he had a great desire to be baptized, in imitation of our Saviour; but that in an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> making Inroads upon <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> in the thirty first year of his Reign and of his Age the sixty sixth, he died on the way at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> before he could reach the River <hi>Jordan</hi> for the purpose he design'd, and was there baptized at the point of Death. But let these men confound and perplex the matter as they please, we have reason to believe according to the general opinion, that <hi>Constantine,</hi> who had so often overcome his Enemies under the Standard of the Cross, who had built so many Churches to the honour of God, who had been present at holy Councils, and who had so often joyned in Devotion with the holy Fathers, would desire to be fortified against the Enemy of mankind by the Character of Baptism, as soon as ever he came to understand the excellency of our Religion. I am not ignorant what <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zomen,</hi> and most other Writers say concerning it, but I follow the Truth, and that which is most agreeable to the Religion and Piety of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prince. The vulgar story of his having been overspread with Leprosie, and cured of it by Baptism, with a previous fiction concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bath of the blood of Infants before prescribed for his Cure, I can by no means give credit to, having herein the Authority of <hi>Socrates</hi> on my side, who affirms, that <hi>Constantine</hi> being now sixty five years of Age fell sick, and left the City of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to go to the hot Baths,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50681:46"/>
for the recovery of his health, but speaks not a word concerning any Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie. Besides, there is no mention made of it by any Writer either Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or Christian; and certainly had there been any such thing, <hi>Orosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Eutropius,</hi> and others who have most accurately written the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of <hi>Constantine,</hi> would not have omitted it. One thing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this great Prince is certain, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Blazing Star or Comet of extraordinary magnitude appear'd some time before his Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcus</hi> applying himself to the care of Religion, ordained that the Bishop of <hi>Ostia,</hi> whose place it is to consecrate the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> might use a Pall. He appointed likewise that upon solemn days immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Gospel, the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed should be rehears'd with a loud voice both by the Clergy and People. He built also two Churches at <hi>Rome,</hi> one in the <hi>Via Ardeatina,</hi> in which he was buried, the other within the City; these Churches <hi>Constantine</hi> presented and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed very liberally.

He appointed likewise, that all matters belonging to the Church should be penned by the Notaries or the Protonotary, whose Office it was to commit to writing all memorable Occurrences. But in our age most of them (not to say all) are so ignorant, that they are scarce able to write their own Names in <hi>Latin,</hi> much less to transmit the actions of others. Concerning their Morals, I am ashamed to say any thing, since Pandars and Parasites have been sometimes preferr'd to that Office. During the Reign of <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Constantius, Marcellus</hi> Bishop of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyra,</hi> was a man of considerable Note, and wrote several things, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly against the <hi>Arians. Asterius</hi> and <hi>Apollinarius</hi> wrote against him, and accused him of the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Heresie, as did likewise <hi>Hilarius,</hi> whom while <hi>Marcellus</hi> is confuting, his very Defence shews him to be of a different Opinion from <hi>Iulius</hi> and <hi>Athanasius.</hi> He was opposed likewise by <hi>Basilius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ancyra</hi> in his Book <hi>de Virginitate;</hi> which <hi>Basilius,</hi> together with <hi>Eustathius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sebastia,</hi> were the principal men of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Party. About this time also <hi>Theodorus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Heraclea</hi> in <hi>Thrace,</hi> a person of terse and copious Elequence, was a considerable Writer, as particularly appears by his Commentaries upon S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> S. <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Psalms</hi> and Epistles.

Returning from thence to <hi>Italy,</hi> he expelled all those of the <hi>Arian</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and admitted none but the Orthodox to the execution of any Ecclesiastical Office. But apprehending the Publick-weal to be in great danger from the attempts of the <hi>Goths,</hi> he associated to himself as a Partner in the Government, <hi>Theodosius</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a person eminent for his Valour and Conduct; who vanquishing the <hi>Alans, Hunns</hi> and <hi>Goths,</hi> re-establish'd the Empire of the <hi>East,</hi> and entred into a League with <hi>Athanaricus</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> after whose Death and magnificent Burial at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> his whole Army repaired to <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared they would serve under no other Commander but that good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.

An Opinion which had been before exploded by <hi>Damasus</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi> But <hi>Martianus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> a man eminent for his Chastity and Eloquence, was very Orthodox in matters of Faith, and a great opposer of the <hi>Novatian</hi> Heresie. <hi>Cyril</hi> also Bishop of <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>

Ambrosius</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a Scholar of <hi>Didymus</hi> wrote a large Volume against <hi>Apollinarius.</hi> At this time flourished those two famous Bishops, <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> for the greatness of his Eloquence deservedly surnamed <hi>Chrysostom;</hi> who so far prevailed upon <hi>Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Maximus</hi> two Condisciples of his, that they left their Masters <hi>Libanius</hi> the Rhetorician, and <hi>Andragatius</hi> the Philosopher, and became Proselytes to Christianity. This <hi>Libanius</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now at the point of death, being asked whom he would leave suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessour in his School; made answer, that he desired no other than <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sosiom,</hi> were he not a Christian. At this time the Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Carthage</hi> being sent to <hi>Zosimus,</hi> were by him confirmed, and thereby the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie condemned throughout the World. Some tell us, that <hi>Petronius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bononia,</hi> and <hi>Possidonius</hi> an <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Bishop, had now gain'd a mighty reputation for Sanctity; that <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masius</hi> wrote largely against the Heresies to Bishop <hi>Fortunatus;</hi> and that <hi>Proba,</hi> Wife to <hi>Adelphus</hi> the Proconsul, composed an Historical Poem of our Saviours Life, consisting wholly of <hi>Virgilian</hi> Verse; though others attribute the honour of this performance to <hi>Eudocia</hi> Empress of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> the younger. But certainly the most learned person of the Age he lived in, was <hi>Augustinus,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> his Convert, Bishop of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> a most strenuous Defender of the Christian Faith both in Discourse and Writing. As for <hi>Zosimus,</hi> having ordained ten Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, three Deacons, eight Bishops, he died, and was buried in the <hi>Via Tiburtina,</hi> near the body of Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> the Martyr, <hi>December</hi> 26th.

the five hundred eighty fourth year since its first being in the hands of the <hi>Romans.</hi> While these things weret ransacting in <hi>Afric, Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Huns,</hi> not contented to have invaded the two <hi>Hungaries,</hi> miserably harasses <hi>Macedonia, Mysia, Achaia</hi> and the <hi>Thraces;</hi> and then, that he might have no sharer in the Kingdom, puts to death his Brother <hi>Bleda.</hi> Soon after his growing ambition prompts him to endeavour the gaining of the <hi>Western</hi> Empire; and therefore getting together in a very little time a great Army, he begins his March upon that Design. This <hi>Aeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> having intelligence of, forthwith sends Ambassadours to <hi>Tholouse</hi> to King <hi>Theodorick</hi> to strike up a Peace; with whom so strict a League was concluded, that they both jointly engage in the War against <hi>Attila,</hi> at a common charge and with equal Forces.

Moreover, <hi>Sixtus</hi> repaired and enlarged the Church of the Blessed Virgin, which was anciently called by the name of <hi>Liberius,</hi> near the Market place of <hi>Livia,</hi> then had the name of S. <hi>Mary</hi> at the Manger, and last of all was called S. <hi>Maries the Geeat.</hi> That <hi>Sixtus</hi> did very much beautifie and make great additions to it, appears from the Inscription on the front of the first Arch in these words, <hi>Xystus Episcopus Plebi Dei;</hi> for according to the <hi>Greek</hi> Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy the name begins with <hi>X</hi> and <hi>y,</hi> though by Custom it is now written <hi>Sixtus</hi> with S and <hi>i.</hi> To this Church that Bishop was very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and munificent; among other instances adorning with <hi>Porphyry</hi> stone the Ambo or Desk where the Gospel and Epistles are read.

This Heresie being condemned by <hi>Flavianus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with the consent of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> a Synod is called at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in which, <hi>Dioscorus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> being President, <hi>Eutyches</hi> was restored, and <hi>Flavianus</hi> censured. But <hi>Theodosius</hi> dying, and his successour <hi>Marcianus</hi> proving a Friend to the Orthodox Doctrine, <hi>Leo</hi> calls a Council at <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> wherein by the authority of six hundred and thirty Bishops, it was decreed as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, that there are two Natures in Christ, and that one and the same Christ is God and Man; by which consequently both <hi>Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Eutyches,</hi> the pestilent Patron of the <hi>Manichees</hi> were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Moreover, the Books of the <hi>Manichees</hi> were publickly burnt; and the pride and heretical Opinions of <hi>Dioscorus</hi> discountenanced and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd. In the mean time <hi>Valentinian</hi> being treacherously murdered, <hi>Maximus</hi> usurps the Empire, and against her will marries <hi>Eudoxia</hi> the Widow of <hi>Valentinian.</hi> Upon this occasion the <hi>Vandals</hi> being called out of <hi>Afric, Genseric</hi> being their Leader, force their entrance into the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> throw the Body of <hi>Maximus,</hi> who had been kill'd in the Tumult by one <hi>Ursus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Soldier, into the River <hi>Tyber,</hi> plunder and burn the City, pillage the Churches and refuse to hearken to Bishop <hi>Leo</hi> begging them, what ever spoils they carried away, only to spare the City it self and the Temples. However, on the fourteenth day from their entrance into <hi>Rome,</hi> they left it, and taking away with them <hi>Eudoxia</hi> and her Daughter, with a great number of other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, they return'd into <hi>Africa. Leo</hi> being now very intent upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good the damages sustain'd from this People, prevailed upon <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metria,</hi> a pious Virgin, to build upon her own ground in the <hi>Via Latina</hi> three miles from the City a Church to S. <hi>Stephen;</hi> and did the same himself in the <hi>Via Appia</hi> in honour to S. <hi>Cornelius.</hi> The Churches which had been in any part ruined, he repaired; and those of the sacred Vessels belonging to them, which had been bruised and broken, he caused to be mended, and those which had been taken away to be made anew; Moreover, he built three Apartments in the Churches of S. <hi>John,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul;</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, whom he called <hi>Cubicularii</hi> to keep and take charge of the Sepulchres of the Apostles; built a Monastery near S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> introduced into the Canon of the Mass, the Clause, <hi>Hoc sanctum sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificium,</hi> this holy Sacrifice, &amp;c. and ordained, that no Recluse should be capable of receiving the Consecrated Veils, unless it did appear that she had preserv'd her Chastity spotless for the space of forty years. But while the good man was employed in these things, there started up of a sudden the Heresie of the <hi>Acephali,</hi> so called because they were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany<note place="margin">Acephali.</note> of foolish, undisciplin'd Schismaticks, or, if it be not a quibble, because they wanted both Brains and Head. These men decried the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> denied the propriety of two Substances in Christ, and asserted, that there could be but one Nature in one Person. But our <hi>Leo</hi> abundantly confuted their absurd Doctrines in his elegant and learned Epistles written to the Faithful upon that Argument.

                  <hi>Felix</hi> now fully understanding that <hi>Peter Mog</hi> the <hi>Eutychian,</hi> who had been banished for his heretical Opinions upon the complaint and at the desire of <hi>Acacius,</hi> was by the same <hi>Acacius</hi> recall'd from Exile, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected that there was a private Agreement between them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excommunicated them both by the authority of the Apostolick See, which was confirm'd in a Synod of the Orthodox. But three years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Emperour <hi>Zeno</hi> testifying that they were penitent, <hi>Felix</hi> sends two Bishops, <hi>Messenus</hi> and <hi>Vitalis,</hi> with full power, upon enquiry into the truth of their repentance, to absolve them. These Legates arriving at the City <hi>Heraclea,</hi> were soon corrupted with bribes, and neglected to act according to their Commission. Whereupon <hi>Felix,</hi> out of a just indignation, having first called a Council upon that occasion, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates them too, as <hi>Simoniacks</hi> and betrayers of the trust reposed in them. Though <hi>Messenus,</hi> who confess'd his fault, and begg'd time to evince the sincerity of his repentance, had it accordingly granted him. The same <hi>Felix</hi> also built the Church of S. <hi>Agapetus,</hi> near that of S. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and ordained that Churches should be consecrated by none but Bishops. 'Tis said, that at this time <hi>Theodorus</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Presbyter wrote against the Hereticks a Book of the Harmony of the Old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; and some reckon among the men of Note in this Age, the Learned and famous Divine <hi>John Damascene,</hi> who wrote the Book of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> imitating therein <hi>Gregory Nazianzene, Gregory Nyssene,</hi> and <hi>Didymus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and compiled also certain Treatises of Medicin, in which he gives an account of the Causes and Cure of Diseases. Our <hi>Felix</hi> having at two <hi>Decembrian</hi> Ordinations made twenty eight Presbyters, five Deacons, thirty Bishops; died, and was buried in the Church of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> He sat in the Chair eight years, eleven months, seventeen days, and by his death the See was vacant five days.</p>

And gaining the Victory over the <hi>French</hi> in a very important Battel, he recovers <hi>Gascoigne,</hi> and undertakes the present Government of it, till <hi>Almaric</hi> the son of <hi>Alaric</hi> should come to Age. The same <hi>Theodoric</hi> to his Conquest of <hi>Italy</hi> added that of <hi>Sicily, Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia, Liburnia, Illyricum, Gallia Narbonensis,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy.</hi> He also walled round the City of <hi>Trent,</hi> and to secure <hi>Italy</hi> from a forein In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion, upon the Frontiers of it near <hi>Aost</hi> placed the <hi>Heruli,</hi> whose King being yet a Minor he made his adopted Son.</p>

of <hi>Messenus,</hi> who had given in his Retractation in Writing, at the request of the Synod he absolved him, and restored him to his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick. But having intelligence that several murthers and other notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous outrages were committed in the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches by the factious fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Peter Mog</hi> and <hi>Acacius,</hi> he forthwith sends his Legates thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with Commission to Excommunicate for ever all those who did not immediately recant their Errours; a new and unusual severity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Primitive Church was wont to wait long in hopes that Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists would at length return to her Bosom. At this time <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> an Orthodox Prelate, and who had been very much persecuted by these seditious people, fled for resuge to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who very kindly and courteously received him. The Churches which <hi>Gelasius</hi> consecrated were, that of S. <hi>Euphemia</hi> the Martyr in <hi>Tivoli,</hi> that of S. <hi>Nicander</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius</hi> in the <hi>Via Labicana,</hi> and that of S. <hi>Mary</hi> in the <hi>Via Laurentina,</hi> twenty miles from <hi>Rome.</hi> He had a great love and honour for the Clergy, and was very liberal and charitable to the poor. He delivered the City of <hi>Rome</hi> from many dangers, and particularly from that of dearth and scarcity. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Hymns in imitation of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> published five Books against <hi>Eutyches</hi> and <hi>Nestorius,</hi> and two against <hi>Arius,</hi> made very elegant and grave Orations, and wrote weighty and learned Epistles to his Friends of the houshold of Faith; all which Works of his are at this time to be seen in the publick Libraries. Some tell us that he Excommunicated <hi>Anastasius,</hi> successour to <hi>Zeno</hi> in the <hi>Eastern</hi> Empire, for favouring <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> and other Hereticks; which is an argument as clear as the Sun, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> has power to Excommunicate any Prince who is erroneous in the Faith, if he continue refractary after Admonition. The same course likewise he took with the <hi>Vandals</hi> and their King, who being infected with the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie, proved now very cruel and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous persecutours of the Orthodox. At the beginning of his Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate lived <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> the latter Bishop of <hi>Pavia,</hi> the former of <hi>Capua;</hi> men who by the authority which the Sanctity of their Lives had gain'd them, and by their humble and obliging deportment, wrought so much upon the minds of the barbarous Invadors, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted <hi>Italy</hi> fared the better for their sakes. At the same time also <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nociatus</hi> Abbat of <hi>Chartres,</hi> with <hi>Aurelianus</hi> and <hi>Mezentius</hi> of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> persons of great Piety and Learning, gain'd so much ground in <hi>Gaul,</hi> that they persuaded <hi>Clodoveus</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, and his Queen <hi>Crocildis</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christians, and to undertake the protection of the Catholick Faith throughout their Dominions; though some attribute this honour to <hi>Remigius,</hi> as hath been already said. <hi>Gelasius</hi> having ordained thirty two Presbyters, two Deacons, sixty seven Bishops, died, and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church, <hi>November</hi> 21.

               <p>At which time <hi>Transamund,</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> shut up the<note place="margin">Anastasius.</note> Churches of the Orthodox Clergy, and banished one hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Bishops into the Island of <hi>Sardinia.</hi> 'Tis reported also that one <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympius,</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> Bishop, having publickly in the Baths at <hi>Carthage</hi> declared his detestation of the Doctrine of the Trinity, was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly smitten and his body burnt with three flashes of Lightning.

               <p>It was this Bishop <hi>Anastasius,</hi> as some Writers tell us, who Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the Emperour <hi>Anastasius</hi> for favouring <hi>Acacius;</hi> though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being himself seduced by the same Heretick, and endeavouring privately to recall him from Exile, he thereby very much alienated the minds of his Clergy, who for that reason, and also because without the consent of the Catholicks, he communicated with <hi>Photinus</hi> a Deacon of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> and an assertour of the <hi>Acacian</hi>

                  <hi>Ruspoe,</hi> though he were among the other Orthodox Bishops of <hi>Africa</hi> banish'd into <hi>Sardinia</hi> by <hi>Transamund,</hi> yet neglected nothing that might contribute to the propagating of the Catholick Faith, whether by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, Preaching, or Admonition. He likewise published several Books of the Trinity, of Free-will, and the Rule of Faith; and besides the several elegant and grave Homilies he made to the people, he wrote against the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresie. The Learned <hi>Egesippus</hi> also, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed<note place="margin">Egesippus.</note> Monastical Constitutions, and in an elegant style wrote the Life of S. <hi>Severinus</hi> the Abbat was at this time very serviceable to the Church. Moreover, <hi>Faustus</hi> a <hi>Gallican</hi> Bishop was now a considerable Writer, but among all his Works the most in esteem was his Tract against <hi>Arius,</hi> wherein he maintains the persons in the Trinity to be Co-essential. He wrote also against those who asserted any created Being to be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, demonstrating both by the Judgment of the Fathers, and from the Testimonies of holy Writ, that God only is purely and properly incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal. But I shall here conclude the Pontificate of <hi>Anastasius,</hi> who at one <hi>Decembrian</hi> Ordination, having made twelve Presbyters, and sixteen Bishops, was buried in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church <hi>November</hi> 19.

Some write that it was in this Bishops time that <hi>Symmachus</hi> and <hi>Boethius</hi> were brought back from Exile, imprison'd, and slain by the cruelty and rage of <hi>Theodoric.</hi> However, certain it is that they were put to death by <hi>Theodoric'</hi>s order; and it matters not much whether it were in the Pontificate of <hi>Hormisda</hi> or <hi>John.</hi> Which <hi>John</hi> returning from <hi>Constantinople, Theodoric</hi> was so highly incens'd against him for his agreement with the Emperour <hi>Justine</hi> both in Faith and manners, that it was a chance that he had not taken away his life immediately; but throw him into Prison he did at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> where through stench and nastiness and want of necessary provision, the good man at length died. A Cruelty for which the divine Vengeance sorely punished <hi>Theodoric</hi> not long after, for he died suddenly of a fit of an Apoplexy, and his Soul (if you will take the word of a devout Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit who reported it) was cast into the flames of the Island <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>para.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Whose General <hi>Belisarius</hi> was victorious over the <hi>Persians,</hi> and passing into <hi>Afric</hi> by his singular courage and conduct subdued and almost quite rooted out the <hi>Vandals,</hi> whose King <hi>Gilimer</hi> he took Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and brought him home with him in Triumph. About this time <hi>Amalasuntha</hi> having a long time lived very uneasily with her malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <hi>Goths,</hi> and having buried her wayward and unruly Son <hi>Athalaric,</hi> associates her kinsman <hi>Theodatus</hi> in the Government. This <hi>Theodatus</hi> was so great a Proficient in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Learning, that he wrote an elegant History of his own times, and was throughly skilled in the Platonick Philosophy. And though he were not naturally of an active Martial temper, yet at the desire of <hi>Amalasuntha</hi> he undertook a War against the <hi>Burgundians</hi> and <hi>Alemanni,</hi> and manag'd it very succces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Felix</hi> in the mean while being careful of the affairs of the Church, excommunicated the Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for Heresie, and built in the <hi>Via Sacra</hi> near the <hi>Forum Romanum</hi> the Church of <hi>S. Cosmus</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> as appears from the Verses yet remaining, wrought in <hi>Mosaick</hi> work. He also re-built the Church of <hi>S.

Some write that in this Age lived <hi>Cassiodorus,</hi> who while he was a Senator wrote several<note place="margin">Cassiodorus.</note> things in Politicks, and when he became a Monk composed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the <hi>Psalms.</hi> 'Tis said also that <hi>Priscian</hi> of <hi>Caesarea,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous<note place="margin">Priscian.</note> Grammarian, now wrote his Book of Grammar. <hi>Arator</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a Sub-Deacon of <hi>Rome</hi> translated the Gospels into Hexameter Verse; and <hi>Justinian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Valence,</hi> was had in great esteem for what he preach'd and wrote concerning the Christian Faith.

Yet herein he made use of the Advice and assistance of <hi>John</hi> a <hi>Patrician, Trebonianus, Theophilus,</hi> and <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> men of great Learning and Authority. With their help an immense number of near two thousand Volumes of Decrees made from the building of the City to this time, confusedly heaped together, were digested under their respective Titles into fifty Books, which are sometimes called <hi>Digests,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Pandects,</hi> because they contain the whole Civil Law. He made also an Epitome of the Laws in four Books, which go under the name of <hi>Institutes,</hi> or <hi>Justinian'</hi>s <hi>Code.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, some tell us that <hi>Justinian</hi> wrote certain Books concerning the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of our Lord, and that at his own charge he built the Temple of <hi>S.

He ordained likewise, that the Clergy should be seperated and placed distinct from the Laity at the time of Celebration. At the same time many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Nobility were so wrought upon by the Sanctity of <hi>Benedict</hi> that they retired to Mount <hi>Cassino</hi> and became Monks there; among whom the more eminent were <hi>Maurus</hi> and <hi>Placidius.</hi> Other men of Note and esteem were <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi> the Abbat, famous for the extraordinary Skill and Judgment which he shewed in his <hi>Paschal Cycle; Famundus,</hi> whose writings against certain <hi>Eutychians</hi> then springing up were very much commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>Martin,</hi> who by his Preaching and Writings converted the People of <hi>Soissons</hi> from the <hi>Arian</hi> Heresie to the Truth.

                  <hi>Belisarius</hi> had now defended the City one whole year and nine days, and having in this time received fresh supplies of Men, he resolved to march out and to engage the Enemy in a pitch'd Battel.

Coming near <hi>Constantinople, Justinian</hi> with a great Retinue went out to meet him, and they both entred the City together, the Clergy going before them, as far as the Temple of S. <hi>Sophia.

                  <hi>JOHN</hi> the third, the Son of <hi>Anastasius,</hi> descended of a Noble Family, lived in the time of <hi>Justine,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Justinian,</hi> but was in nothing like him.</p>
               <p>For he was Covetous, lewd, rapacious, a contemner of<note place="margin">Justine.</note> God and Men to such a degree, that his Vices made him srantick; so that his Wife <hi>Sophia</hi> managed all affairs till the time of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> the second. This Woman, being prompted thereto by some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious persons who hated <hi>Narses,</hi> recalls him out of <hi>Italy</hi> in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful words, <hi>That she would have the Eunuch come home and spin.</hi> This he very highly resenting, as well he might, returns answer, <hi>That he would spin such a Web, as none of his Enemies should ever be able to unweave.</hi> And he was as good as word. For he presently sends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites <hi>Alboinus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> with all his people, then possessed of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> to come and seat themselves in the more plentiful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Italy.

Being thus slush'd with Victory, he goes to <hi>Verona,</hi> which he constitutes the the Capital City of his Kingdom; where being once at an Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

over-heated with Wine, he compelled his Wife <hi>Rosimund</hi> to drink out of a Cup which he had made of her own Fathers Skull, whom he himself had slain. Now there was in <hi>Alboinus'</hi>s Army one <hi>Helmechild,</hi> a very handsom young Gentleman, and an excellent Soldier; and who was <hi>Rosimund'</hi>s particular Favourite. Him she discourses privately, and by proposing to him the hopes of succeeding in the Kingdom, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him to murder <hi>Alboinus.</hi> But they were both so hated for the Fact by the <hi>Lombards,</hi> that they not only failed of their hopes, but were glad to fly for protection to <hi>Longinus</hi> the <hi>Exarch</hi> of <hi>Ravenna;</hi> where not long after they poisoned each other, and died together. At this time <hi>Italy,</hi> by reason of the Incursions which the barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made into it, was in a very calamitous state; which had been por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Prodigies, and Apparitions of flaming Armies in the Air, and also by an extraordinary inundation of the River <hi>Tyber</hi> which had very much damaged the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time our <hi>John</hi> repaired the Coemeteries of the Saints, and finished the Church of SS. <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>James</hi> which had been begun by <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and drew <hi>Narses,</hi> who had been an avowed Enemy to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> for their ill opinion of him and their misrepresenting him to the Empress <hi>Sophia,</hi> from <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Rome;</hi> where he not long after died, and his Body was conveyed in a Coffin of Lead to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> In such a consusion of things the State of <hi>Italy</hi> must needs certainly have been utterly ruined, if some eminently holy men had not supported and prop'd up the tottering Nation. Among others, <hi>Paul</hi> Patriarch of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quileia,</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> Bishop of <hi>Treviso</hi> interceded successfully with <hi>Alboi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> when he first entred <hi>Italy,</hi> in the behalf of the Inhabitants. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Fortunatus</hi> a person of extraordinary Learning and Eloquence, very much civiliz'd and polish'd the <hi>Gauls</hi> by his Books and Example; compiling a Treatise of Government inscribed to their King <hi>Sigebert,</hi> and writing in an elegant style the Life of S. <hi>Martin.</hi> Some write that at this time lived <hi>Germanus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> a person of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Piety, who kept the Kings of <hi>France</hi> within the bounds of their duty to such a Degree, that each strove to excel the other in Religion and Piety, in Goodness and Clemency. So prevalent is the Example of a good Pastour, such an one as <hi>Germanus</hi> was, in whom they saw nothing but what was worthy of their imitation. After this one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Remark, that in our <hi>John'</hi>s time the <hi>Armenians</hi> were converted to Christianity, I shall say no more of him, but that having been in the Chair twelve years, eleven months, twenty six days, he died, and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

'Tis said also that he had brought to him out of <hi>Italy</hi> a great Estate which <hi>Narses</hi> had got there, which in like manner he employed in Liberality and Munificence. To <hi>Sigebert</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, who had sent Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to him, besides the other Presents that he made, which were very considerable, he sent certain Medals of Gold of very great weight, on the one side of which was the Effigies of the Emperour with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, <hi>Tiberii Constantini perpetuo Augusti;</hi> on the other side was a Charriot with its Driver and this Inscription, <hi>Romanorum Gloria.</hi> And to complete his Successes, the Army which he had sent against the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> returning victoriously, brought away with twenty Elephants so vast a Booty, as no Army had ever done in any Expedition before.

For it is probable, that, the Election being free, the Clergy and People will chuse, and the Magistrate approve of no other, than such an one as deserves and is fit to be Governour in the Church. Though (if I may speak it without offence to any that are good) the truth is, multitudes do now aspire to the Dignity of Bishops, not as they ought to do for the sake of the publick good, but that they may satisfie their own Covetousness and Ambition. For the great Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, what any Bishoprick is worth, not how great a Flock there is to take the charge of.

Returning to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Elephants loaded with other great Booty, he brought along with him the Cross of our Blessed Saviour which the <hi>Persians</hi> had taken away, and laid it up in the place where it was before.

After this being arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and taking delight in study, he applied himself to Astrology. But yet this great Emperour, against all Law both Divine and Humane married his own Sister's Daughter; and to add one Crime to another, as is usual when men once become guilty, he falls off to the <hi>Eutychian</hi> Heresie. This happened at the time when <hi>Anastasius</hi> a <hi>Persian,</hi> being converted to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and having entred upon a Monastick Life, was seized by his own Countrey-men, and suffered Martyrdom for the sake of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; whose body was afterwards conveyed to <hi>Rome</hi> and reposited in the Monastery of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> 'Tis said, that at this time <hi>Sisebute</hi> King of the <hi>Goths,</hi> reduced several Cities of <hi>Spain</hi> which had revolted to the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that by Torment he forced all the <hi>Jews</hi> which he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in his Kingdom to profess the belief of Christianity.

                  <hi>BONIFACE</hi> the fifth, a <hi>Campanian,</hi> his Father's name <hi>John,</hi> was chosen Pope at the time when <hi>Eleutherius</hi> a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trician,</hi> being sent by <hi>Heraclius</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd the Death of <hi>John</hi> the late <hi>Exarch</hi> of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Kingdom of <hi>Italy.</hi> But in his way to <hi>Rome</hi> he was put to Death by his own Soldiers, and his Head sent to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> Upon which <hi>Isaacius</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> another <hi>Patrician,</hi> was made <hi>Exarch</hi> in his stead. <hi>Theudelinda</hi> now after the Death of her Husband <hi>Adoaldus,</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning together with her Son the Kingdom of the <hi>Lombards</hi> very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and justly, maintained a Peace between her People and the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> for ten years together; made several Presents and Donations to several Churches, and endowed them with Lands for the better main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Clergy belonging to them. In the twelfth year of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclius, Mahomet</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> as some will have him, or as others a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mahomet.</note> descended of a Noble Family, his Father a <hi>Gentile,</hi> his Mother a <hi>Jewess,</hi> was the Author of so much mischief to the Christian State, that I am afraid lest his Sect should utterly extinguish the Remains of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity; especially in our Age, wherein we are grown listless and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and stand still tamely exspecting our own Ruin. His Sect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails and encreases now more than ever; All <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Europe</hi> is subject to <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes; the <hi>Turks</hi> press bard upon us by Sea and Land, that they may ferret us like Coneys
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50681:71"/>
out of these Burrows in <hi>Europe.</hi> In the mean time we sit idly, looking upon one another, as if the whole State of Christianity were not at all in danger. The Clergy expect that so important and necessary a War should be undertaken by the Laity. The Laity expect that the Clergy should expend their Money to bear the Charge of a War for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Religion, and not put it to worse Uses, as most of them are wont to do, laying out their Stock gotten by Alms and Martyr's Bloud upon huge large Vessels of massy Gold and Silver, while themselves in the mean time carry it arrogantly towards Men, are contemners of God, whom they serve only for Gain, and are not at all solicitous for the time to come. But I return to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> a man of so wily a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and so sharp a Wit, that having long conversed among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and acquainted himself with all the Sects that had been before him, he introduced a new kind of Superstition, which has, as we see, almost rooted out Christianity. Moreover, having got together a great Army of <hi>Arabians,</hi> he was so hardy as to encroach upon the Borders of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but <hi>Heraclius</hi> soon put a stop to his Motion, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by Promises and Bribes prevailed with his Soldiers to make a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from him.</p>
               <p>As for Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> he was a person of singular Humanity, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and obliging Deportment towards all men, and neglected no part of the Duty of a good Bishop. He ordained, that Criminals who fled for Refuge to Churches, should not be taken thence by force; that the <hi>Acolythi</hi> should not meddle with the Reliques of the Martyrs, that belonging to Presbyters and Sub-deacons; and that in every place those who were guilty of sacriledg should be Excommunicated. He built and dedicated the Coemetery of S. <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> and was in an extraordinary manner liberal and munificent towards those of the Clergy who led exemplary Lives. At this time <hi>Gallus</hi> a Scholar of S. <hi>Columbanus</hi> lived so devoutly, that he deserved to be canonized a Saint even in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. <hi>Eustachius</hi> the Abbat followed his Example, and so did S. <hi>Aurea,</hi> in honour to whom <hi>Eligius</hi> built a Nunnery. 'Tis said also, that at this time one <hi>Basilius</hi> was very famous for his Life and Learning, and in both equal to <hi>Isidore</hi> himself. Our <hi>Boniface</hi> having been in the Chair five years, ten days, died, and was buried in the Church of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> By his death See was vacant thirteen days.</p>

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:50681:71"/>
who pretending himself to be the great Prophet of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding the <hi>Asians</hi> and <hi>Africans</hi> by Magical Arts, put such vigour into the people who embraced his new Religion, that he was very near to have ruin'd the Empire; having taken <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and several impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Cities of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia.</hi> He had for his followers the <hi>Saracens,</hi> so called from <hi>Sarah Abraham'</hi>s lawful Wife, as if they were the only legitimate Successours and Heirs of the divine Promise. The crafty man herein followed the Example of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who prescrib'd distinct Rules of Worship to his Tribes, that they might not be subject to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Government. The same also afterwards did the <hi>Greeks</hi> who dissented from the Catholicks, not only for the sake of Religion, but Empire, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the score of which they followed the Errours of the <hi>Nestorians, Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites,</hi> and <hi>Ebionites.</hi> But in the end their pertinacy reduc'd them to that pass, that their Religion and Government were dissolved together, and they brought into the vilest servitude. But <hi>Mahomet</hi> (as we see in the <hi>Alcoran</hi>) that he might separate his Disciples as far as possible from Christianity, in composing his Laws followed the Example of several Hereticks, and especially the <hi>Nestorians;</hi> collecting here and there, and reducing into one Body, many things repugnant to the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Gospel. 'Tis said that at this time <hi>Heraclius,</hi> distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own strength, struck up an inglorious Peace with the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and that being impos'd upon by the Arts of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he fell off to the Heresie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> a Sect so called from their asserting one Will only in Christ. But these Seducers, at the Instance of <hi>Honorius</hi> who was very diligent to reclaim <hi>Heraclius,</hi> were afterwards banished. And <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> having now some respite from other cares, by his Learning and Example proved a great Reformer of the Clergy. The Church of S. <hi>Peter</hi> he covered with Brass taken out of the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinus;</hi> repaired that of S. <hi>Agnes</hi> in the <hi>Via Nomentana,</hi> as appears by an Inscription in Verse therein, and likewise that of S. <hi>Pancras</hi> in the <hi>Via Aurelia;</hi> built those of S. <hi>Anastasius,</hi> S. <hi>Cyriacus,</hi> seven miles from <hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Via Ostiensis,</hi> and S. <hi>Severinus</hi> in <hi>Tivoli;</hi> all which he made very stately, and adorn'd with Gold, Silver, Porphyry, Marble, and all manner of Ornamental workmanship. He repaired also the Coemetery of SS. <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Via Labicana,</hi> and was at the charge of building other Churches, besides those before-mentioned. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he ordained that every <hi>Saturday</hi> a Procession with Litanies should be made from S. <hi>Apollinaris</hi> to S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s.

The ground of this Action, was <hi>Isaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius'</hi>s Resentment that the Clergy alone should grow rich, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the Charge of the Wars, especially at a time when the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were reduc'd to the greatest want and extremity. Part of the spoil he distributed among the Soldiers, part he carried away with him to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and of the rest he made a Present to the Emperour. Those of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who had been listed by <hi>Heraclius,</hi> being discontented for want of Pay, march'd into <hi>Syria,</hi> and made themselves Masters of <hi>Damascus,</hi> a City subject to the Empire. Then joyning with the other <hi>Arabians,</hi> and being furnished with Provisions and Arms, and heated by <hi>Mahomet'</hi>s Zeal, they over-run <hi>Phoenicia</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and put to the Sword all those who refused to subscribe to their Government, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet'</hi>s Religion. Advancing thence against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and having slain <hi>Hormisda</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> King, they ceased not to commit all manner of outrages upon that People, till they had entirely reduced them to subjection. But <hi>Heraclius</hi> having intelligence of what work these <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> made, especially upon their taking of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and searing that they might possess themselves of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> it self, (which they not long after did,) took care to have the Cross of our Saviour conveyed to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that it might not again come into the hands of the <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi> (for so the <hi>Greeks</hi> in contempt call the <hi>Arabians,</hi> as descending from <hi>Agar Abraham'</hi>s Servant.)

Hereupon <hi>John Baptist,</hi> a Saint to whom <hi>Rhotaris</hi> had been in his life-time very much devoted, appear'd to the Priest, and threatned him with Death, if he ever entred his Church again. The like happened even in our times to Cardinal <hi>Luigi,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia,</hi> whose Sepulchre was broke open and pillaged by those very men whom he himself had enriched and raised from a mean condition to the Sacerdotal Dignity. <hi>Rhodoaldus</hi> entring upon the Government of the Kingdom, marries <hi>Gundiberga</hi> the Daughter of Queen <hi>Theudelinda,</hi> who imitating her Mother's Devotion, built and richly adorned a Church in Honour to S. <hi>John Baptist</hi> at <hi>Terracina,</hi> in like manner as <hi>Theudelinda</hi> had done at <hi>Monza.</hi> But <hi>Rhodoaldus</hi> being taken in Adultery, was slain by the Husband of the Adulteress.

               <p>Pope <hi>John</hi> fearing now lest the Bodies of <hi>Vincentius</hi> and <hi>Anastasius</hi> might sometime or other be violated by the barbarous Nations, took care to have them safely conveyed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and with great Solemnity reposited them in the Oratory of S. <hi>John Baptist,</hi> near the Baptistery of the <hi>Lateran.</hi> We are told, that in his Pontificate <hi>Vincentius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> and <hi>Muardus</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Reims,</hi> were in great esteem for their Learning and Sanctity.

                  <hi>THEODORUS,</hi> a <hi>Grecian,</hi> Son of <hi>Theodorus</hi> a Bishop, born at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was no sooner in the Chair, but he applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, like a good Bishop, to all those things which he thought might tend to the advancement of the Christian Religion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a person obliging to all men, but extraordinarily bountiful to the poor.</p>
               <p>At this time <hi>Heraclius</hi> died of a Dropsie in the thirtieth year of his Reign, having a little before made <hi>Theodorus,</hi> surnamed <hi>Calliopa,</hi> his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in the place of <hi>Isaacius</hi> deceased. <hi>Heraclius</hi> was succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Son <hi>Constantine,</hi> who in the fourth month after his coming to the Empire was poisoned by the procurement of his Step-mother <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> and her Son <hi>Heracleon,</hi> whom, it is said, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> the Patriarch prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to commit that Villany. <hi>Heracleon</hi> upon the Death of his Brother takes upon him the Government, at that time particularly when <hi>Cyrus, Sergius,</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> reviving the Heresie of the <hi>Acephali,</hi> maintained the Opinion of one only Nature in Christ, one Operation, and one Will. Among these <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> hearing of the Death of <hi>Heraclius,</hi> and being very desirous to return out of <hi>Asrica,</hi> whither he had been banished, into his own Countrey, coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and making an hypocritical Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Errours, was restored by <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and received from him a Form of Belief. But he lost his Life before he could accomplish the end which he sought to compass by such ill means. For the Senate and people of <hi>Constantinople</hi> being acquainted with the cause of <hi>Constantine'</hi>s Death, first seize <hi>Martina</hi> and <hi>Heracleon,</hi> and having cut off his Nose, and cut out her Tongue, banish them both; then apprehending <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> who endeavoured to make his escape, they put him to Death. <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the Son of <hi>Constantine,</hi> who had been thus treacherously murdered, they create Emperour; and instead of <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> make <hi>Paul</hi> their Bishop; whom yet <hi>Theodorus</hi> deprived for being in the like kind Heretical, his pertinacy therein being favoured by <hi>Constantius,</hi> who was unadvisedly fallen into the same Heresie. But the Pope laying aside this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, and applying himself to other cares, caused the bones of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs <hi>Primus</hi> and <hi>Felicianus</hi> to be removed out of a sandy Grotto in the <hi>Via Nomentana</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he reposited them in the Church of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> the Proto-martyr, sparing no cost in Ornaments both of Silver and Gold upon their Tomb. He also built and adorn'd a Church in the <hi>Via Flaminia,</hi> as likewise two Oratories, one near the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church dedicated to S. <hi>Sebastian,</hi> the other in the <hi>Via Ostiensis</hi> to <hi>Eupolus</hi> the Martyr. Having finished these things, and been in the Chair six years. five months, eighteen days, he died, and was buried in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s, <hi>May</hi> the 14th.

               <p>
                  <hi>MARTINUS</hi> the first, born at <hi>Todi,</hi> Son of <hi>Fabricius,</hi> succeeding <hi>Theodorus,</hi> forthwith dispatches his Legates to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> to admonish <hi>Paul</hi> to quit his Errours, and at length to return into the way of Truth. But he not only disobeyed the Popes Commands, but also, being countenanced therein by <hi>Constantius,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered great indignities to these Legates, and then banish'd them into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Islands. <hi>Martinus</hi> highly resenting this usage, calls a Synod of an hundred and fifty Bishops at <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein he renews the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cyrus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Sergius,</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and excommunicates and deprives <hi>Paul</hi> the Patriarch with the bitterest Anathemas imaginable.</p>
               <p>While these things were transacting, the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> which had lasted between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Lombards,</hi> thirty years, began now to be disturbed. For the <hi>Lombards</hi> took mightily upon them, and imposed such unjust conditions upon the <hi>Romans</hi> as they could not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to; particularly <hi>Rhotaris</hi> being himself an <hi>Arian,</hi> had scarce any City over which he did not set up an <hi>Arian</hi> as well as a <hi>Catholick</hi> Bishop. This was an Evil which both <hi>Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Martine</hi> had often endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to remedy, but in vain. For this reason, and also at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Theodorus</hi> the <hi>Exarch,</hi> a War was proclaimed with the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi> whereupon they take up Arms, and near <hi>Scultenna</hi> a River of <hi>Modena,</hi> a sharp Engagement there was on both sides. But in the end <hi>Theodorus</hi> was vanquish'd and routed, and lost in the fight near seven thousand of his Men. <hi>Rhotaris</hi> being flush'd with this Victory, in a short time easily made himself Master of all <hi>Liguria.</hi> Now <hi>Constantius</hi> hoping that the change of his General might change his Fortune too, recalls <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and sends <hi>Olympuis</hi> his <hi>Exarch</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> with Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, both to propagate the Sect of the <hi>Monothelites</hi> throughout <hi>Italy,</hi> and also either to put Pope <hi>Martine</hi> to Death, or else to take care to have him sent Prisoner to <hi>Constantinople. Olympius</hi> coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> where there had been already a Synod held against this and other the Errours of the Oriental Church, and finding that he could not disperse the Contagion as he thought to do, sends one of his Officers to seize <hi>Martine</hi> in the Church of S. <hi>Maria Maggiore,</hi> and either to bring him to him, or else to kill him if he refus'd and made resistance. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer being just ready to execute this Order, was by Miracle suddenly struck with blindness; and so by divine Providence <hi>Martine</hi> escaped the danger. The <hi>Saracens</hi> taking heart upon this great dissention between the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Church, set sail from <hi>Alexandria</hi> with a great Fleet, and arriving at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and taking the City, they destroyed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and celebrated <hi>Coloss</hi> there, with the Brass of which it's said they loaded nine hundred Camels; this <hi>Coloss</hi> being seventy foot high, the Workmanship of <hi>Chares</hi> the Scholar of <hi>Lysippus.</hi> Afterwards having possessed themselves of several Islands in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and thence sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Sicily,</hi> they very much infested the Inhabitants of that Island. Hereupon <hi>Olympius</hi> at the entreaty of Pope <hi>Martine,</hi> makes an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and forces them thence; though not without the loss of many of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50681:74"/>
his Ships and Men, and even that of his own Life too, for he fell sick in <hi>Sicily</hi> and died there. But <hi>Constantius,</hi> who was not in the least bettered by all these Calamities, commands <hi>Theodorus Calliopa</hi> again into <hi>Italy,</hi> with express Order, that he should forthwith send Pope <hi>Martine</hi> bound to him; and to assist him in that Affair, he joins <hi>Paulus Pellarius</hi> with him, who was to take care to see it done. <hi>Theodorus</hi> having been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably received by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and going upon pretence of making a Visit to the Pope, seizes and puts him in Fetters, and so sends him to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from whence he was afterwards banish'd to the <hi>Chersonese,</hi> the place where <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> had formerly been an Exile. Now <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> being thus compassed with Calamities, and pinch'd with extreme want, at length dies in Banishment, after he had been in the Chair six years, one month, twenty six days. And because it was long before there came certain intelligence of his Death, the See was vacant fourteen months.</p>

After some time they return to <hi>Alexandria</hi> loaded with spoil, and carry away with them those Ornaments of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which <hi>Constantius</hi> had brought to <hi>Syracuse</hi> with design to transmit them to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> These miseries and Calamities had been portended by a Comet which appeared three months together; by great Rains and frequent Thunders, such as had not been at any time known before. But such is the blindness of Mankind, that though they be warn'd of future Evils, yet they do not, as they ought, provide against them. 'Tis reported, that all the standing Corn which had been lodg'd by the continued Rains, grew yet up again, and came to maturity, especially in <hi>Lombardy.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Adeodatus,</hi> being a person of great Piety and Humanity, merciful towards Offenders, bountiful to the poor, hospitable towards strangers, and compassionate towards all in Calamity, repaired and dedicated the Church of S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Via Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuensis.</hi> He also added to the Building and Revenues of the Monastery of S. <hi>Erasmus</hi> on <hi>Mons Coelius,</hi> wherein himself had been a Monk. Moreover, he appointed frequent Litanies upon the account of those Prodigies which we have said appear'd at that time. At length having been in the Chair four years, two months, five days, he died, and was with general lamentation buried in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s, <hi>June</hi> the 26th. The See was then vacant four months, twenty days.</p>

                  <hi>DONUS,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> Son of <hi>Mauritius,</hi> was made Pope at the time when <hi>Grimoaldus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> drawing a Bow high to shoot at a Pigeon, and thereby straining his Nerves and Veins, though it were nine days after he had been let Blood in the Arm, yet thereupon it fell a bleeding afresh, and could not be stanch'd till he died. There were in this King several excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Endowments both of Body and Mind. He was a person of great Wisdom and Prudence in all Affairs; and added several things very useful to <hi>Rhotaris</hi> his Edict, which afterwards receiv'd the Form of a Law. He was of a middle Stature, strong Constitution, had a bald head, and long beard; and was every way fitted for Action. He was buried at <hi>Pavia</hi> in the Church of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> which he had built

Encouraged by this Voice, though the Author of it were uncertain, he returned into <hi>Italy,</hi> and within three months after <hi>Grimoaldus'</hi>s Death became repossess'd of his Father's Kingdom without any opposition. About the same time died <hi>Dagobert</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, a subtil and crafty Prince, and who was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted for Counsel and Action; whose Soul, when it had been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Devils almost as far as the Island of <hi>Lipara,</hi> is reported to have been delivered out of their Clutches, by <hi>Dennis</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and <hi>Martin</hi> the Confessour, Saints for whom as his Patrons he had all his life-time a great veneration, and had been very liberal in beautifying and enriching their Churches.

                  <hi>AGATHO,</hi> a <hi>Sicilian,</hi> was <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 702. of a Monk made Pope; a person of great Piety, and who cured a Leper, whom he chanced to meet with, only by a kiss. He was a man of so obliging a temper, that no person went away sad out of his Presence. And being so happy as to have a Contemporary Emperour like himself, he designed to hold a Council vpon the account of the <hi>Monothelites.</hi> Only he waited the time till <hi>Constantine</hi> should return from the War, who had vanquish'd the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and made them tributary to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> advancing out of <hi>Scythia</hi> into <hi>Thrace,</hi> and the Emperour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to put a check to their motion, he was with great loss routed between <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Moesia.</hi> Hereupon, he found himself obliged to strike up a peace with them upon disadvantageous terms, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to inhabit <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Moesia;</hi> though that Concession in the event proved a great benefit to the State of Christianity. For these are the men who for this seven hundred and seventy years since have maintained a continual War, and been the Bulwark of Christendom against the <hi>Turks.</hi> Well, a Peace being upon these Conditions conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> sends to <hi>Constantinople</hi> his Legates <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>Porto,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> a Deacon of <hi>Rome.</hi> Them <hi>Constantine</hi> receiv'd with all expressions of respect, and very affectionately advised them to lay aside all Cavils and sophistical wranglings and Controversies, and sincerely to endeavour the uniting the two Churches. There were present at this Synod two hundred and eighty nine Bishops; and by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Emperour there were brought out of the Library of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> those Books, from whence the Opinions and Determinations of the Ancients might be collected. <hi>Gregory</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Macarius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> perverting the sense of the Fathers maintain'd only one Will and Operation in Christ.

This Affair being thus successfully managed, that thanks might be return'd to God for this Union of the two Churches in heart and mind, <hi>John</hi> Bishop of <hi>Porto,</hi> on the Octave of <hi>Easter,</hi> in the presence of the Emperour, Patriarch and the People of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the Church of S. <hi>Sophia</hi> celebrates the Mass in <hi>Latin,</hi> all that were present approving that way, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning those that thought otherwise.

               <p>
                  <hi>LEO</hi> the second, a <hi>Sicilian,</hi> Son of <hi>Paul,</hi> was as appears by his Writings, a person throughly learned in the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Languages. Having also good skill in Musick, he composed Notes upon the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and very much improved all Church Musick. He ordained likewise, that at the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Mass the <hi>Pax</hi> should be given to the people. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he so vigorously maintained and asserted the sixth Synod, of which we have spoken in the Life of <hi>Agatho,</hi> that he Excommunicated all those whom in the presence of <hi>Constantine</hi> that Synod had condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. He also repress'd the pride of the Bishops of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> a matter before attempted by Pope <hi>Agatho,</hi> and ordained that the Election of the Clergy of <hi>Ravenna</hi> should be invalid, unless it were confirmed by the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> See; whereas before they presuming upon the power of their <hi>Exarchs,</hi> managed all things arbitrarily, owning no subjection to any, but mating even the Popes themselves. He likewise solemnly decreed, that no person promoted to the dignity of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop should pay any thing for the use of the <hi>Pall,</hi> or upon any other score, a Decree which I could wish it were observed at this day, seeing how many Evils have arisen through Bribery. While <hi>Leo</hi> was busied in these matters, <hi>Rhomoaldus</hi> Duke of <hi>Beneventum,</hi> having raised a great Army, possess'd himself of <hi>Taranto, Brindisi,</hi> and all <hi>Puglia,</hi> and his Wife <hi>Theodata,</hi> a devout Lady, out of the spoils of the War built a Church in honour to S. <hi>Peter</hi> not far from <hi>Beneventum,</hi> and a Nunnery. <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaldus</hi> dying was succeeded by his Son <hi>Grimoaldus,</hi> who deceasing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Issue male, left the Dukedom to his Brother <hi>Gisulphus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Leo,</hi> who besides his great Learning and Eloquence, was also an extraordinary person for Devotion and Charity, and by his Doctrine and Example very much promoted Justice, Fortitude, Clemency, and Good Will among all men, having been in the Chair only ten months, died, and <hi>June</hi> the 28th, was accompanied to his burial in the Church of S. <hi>Peter</hi> with the tears of all men, who deplored the loss of him as of a Common Father. After his Death the See was vacant eleven months, twenty one days. The time of his Pontificate was short, but the Reputation he gain'd therein so great, that one would think he had lived longer than he did, by the celebrated Name which he had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly acquired in so little time.</p>

                  <hi>BENEDICT</hi> the second, a <hi>Roman,</hi> his Father's Name <hi>John,</hi> being from his Youth brought up to the Clergy, was so intent upon the study of Holy Writ, that he became an extraordinary Proficient in Divinity. He was likewise a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of great Compassion, Charity, and good Will towards all, espcially the Poor; Virtues by which he so won the Hearts of men, that he was pitch'd upon as the only person, who by general consent was fit to succeed in the Place of <hi>Leo</hi> deceased. The Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> out of the Veneration he had for this mans Sanctity, sent him a Decree, in which it was established that for the time to come He whom the Clergy and People of <hi>Rome</hi> should chuse Pope, should be forthwith acknowledged Christ's true Vicar, without expecting the Authority of the Emperour or his <hi>Exarchs,</hi> according to former usage, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Emperour or his Vicegerent in <hi>Italy</hi> was necessary to the creation of a Pope. <hi>Pertheris</hi> now King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Religion and Charity of <hi>Benedict,</hi> built a Monastery in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to S. <hi>Agatha</hi> at <hi>Pavia;</hi> and his Wife <hi>Rhodelinda</hi> prompted by the Example of her Husband built the Church of S. <hi>Mary ad Perticas</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Walls of <hi>Pavia.</hi> This they did out of a Principle of Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, understanding that Pope <hi>Benedict</hi> had with vast expence repaired, beautified and enriched the Churches of S. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> that of S. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> in <hi>Lucina,</hi> that of S. <hi>Valentine</hi> in the <hi>Via Flaminia,</hi> and that of S. <hi>Mary ad Martyres.

But <hi>Pertheris</hi> raising an Army, at the first Engagement routs him, besieges <hi>Trent</hi> whither he had fled for Refuge, and though <hi>Alalchis</hi> had first made his escape thence by night, takes the City. However, <hi>Pertheris</hi> was a Prince of so great Clemency as to receive him again into favour upon his submission, and to make him Duke of <hi>Brescia.</hi> Some tell us, that in <hi>Benedict'</hi>s time an extraordinary Star was seen near the <hi>Vergiliae</hi> several Nights together in a clear Sky be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Christmas</hi> and <hi>Epiphany.</hi> I deny not but that a Comet then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and portended something; but it's Neighbourhood to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation is incoherent, unless we make that prodigious too.

                  <hi>CONON,</hi> by birth a <hi>Thracian,</hi> educated in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and thence entring into Orders at <hi>Rome,</hi> was of a Presbyter made Pope. For there happening a Controversie about the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Citizens being for <hi>Peter</hi> an Arch-bishop, and the Soldiers for one <hi>Theodorus</hi> a Priest: at length after a long Contention both Parties agreed in the Choice of <hi>Conon.</hi> And indeed he did every way deserve so great a Dignity; being a man of great Learning and very good Life, pious and devout, of a comely Person and most Venerable, or as some called it, Angelical Aspect; of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Simplicity and Sincerity, Modesty and Justice, Resolution and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. For these excellent Endowments of his all persons concern'd with mighty acclamations of Applause immediately confirm'd his Election; as did also <hi>Theodorus Exarch</hi> of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> who being deceased, was not long after succeeded in the <hi>Exarchate</hi> by <hi>John Platina,</hi> whom I believe to have given the name to the place of my Nativity, called <hi>Platina,</hi> within the Territory of <hi>Cremona.</hi> For there being frequent Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Exarchs</hi> and the Kings of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> it is not improbable, considering that that place was scituated almost in the mid-way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Ravenna</hi> and <hi>Pavia,</hi> one of which was the Seat of the <hi>Lombard</hi> Kings, the other of the <hi>Exarchs,</hi> there might at some time be a Battel fought or a Camp pitched there, from whence we know that names are oftentimes given to places, as particularly in the same Countrey there is <hi>Vitelliana,</hi> a Town so called from <hi>Vitellius</hi> his encamping there, and <hi>Bebrignano</hi> not far from <hi>Bebriacum</hi> famous for the defeat which <hi>Otho</hi> there received.

And indeed such a covetous and ambitious wretch deserv'd to be frustrated in his designs, who made a Bribe of that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Church, which according to <hi>Conon'</hi>s Will should have been laid out in relieving the poor and repairing of Churches. A Crime to be abhorred in all men, but most detestable in an Ecclesiastick. Such a breach of trust would not have been committed by <hi>Hubert,</hi> who was now a Bishop in <hi>Bretagne,</hi> of great Note for his Learning and Piety; nor <hi>Leodegarius</hi> the Martyr Bishop of <hi>Autun,</hi> who was put to Death by <hi>Theodoric</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> for his frequent and free reproofs; nor by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doenus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Roan,</hi> a man who was second to none for Knowledg and Sanctity. These were men remov'd from Ambition and Avarice, fixing all their trust in God and Religion, and gaining thereby Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among men in this World, and eternal happiness from God in the other. As for <hi>Conon,</hi> having been in the Chair only eleven months, and three days, he died, and was buried in <hi>S. Peter'</hi>s, <hi>September</hi> the 21st. The See was then vacant two months, twenty three days.</p>

                  <hi>SERGIUS,</hi> a <hi>Syrian,</hi> born at <hi>Antioch,</hi> son of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> coming to <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of Pope <hi>Adeodatus,</hi> was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the number of the <hi>Reman</hi> Clergy. Afterwards through his Industry and Improvements in divine Knowledg, advancing gradually he was ordained Parish-Priest of the Church of <hi>S. Susanna.</hi> He thereupon beginning more and more to frequent the Coemeteries, and there to perform sacred Offices, by this means he gain'd so great a reputation, that upon the Decease of <hi>Conon,</hi> he was chosen his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour, though indeed after a long debate. For the People being divided into two Parties, one stood up for <hi>Theodorus,</hi> and the other for <hi>Paschal</hi> the Arch deacon. <hi>Theodorus</hi> with his Party had forced his entrance into the inner part of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Palace; the outer from the Oratory of <hi>S. Sylvester</hi> to the Church of the house of <hi>Julia,</hi> was possessed by <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal.</hi> But the Contention and debate growing so high, that every one thought they would come to blows, each Party resolving not to give place to the other unless by force compelled thereunto, the principal of the Citizens, Clergy and Soldiery assembled together to consult what were best to be done to lay this Tumult. At length having duly considered the whole matter, and judging it not fit to commit the Popedom to either of those who to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> their own ambition had been the cause of so great disorders, by divine direction they make choice of <hi>Sergius</hi> without the least opposition; and taking him out of the midst of the croud upon their shoulders, they carry him first into the Oratory of S. <hi>Caesarius</hi> the Martyr, then into the <hi>Lateran</hi> Palace, breaking open the doors by force, and driving out those who were in it before. <hi>Theodorus</hi> seeing how all agreed in the choice, salutes <hi>Sergius</hi> by the name of Pope, and kisses him. <hi>Paschal</hi> the other Competitour did the same, though sorely against his Will, and being only aw'd thereinto by the armed multitude. For secretly and under-hand he did by Letters, Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers and Promises so strongly sollicite <hi>John Exarch</hi> of <hi>Ravenna</hi> to perform at length what he had promis'd him for his Money, that the said <hi>John</hi> comes forthwith to <hi>Rome,</hi> without sending any advice before, that so he might have the advantage of coming upon them unprovided, and while they were off their guard. But when he understood that <hi>Sergius</hi> was by universal consent declared Pope, and urg'd the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what <hi>Paschal</hi> had promis'd him, upon <hi>Sergius'</hi>s expressing a high dislike and detestation of any such bribery, he violently seizes and carries away several things of value from the Church of <hi>S. Peter.</hi> As for <hi>Paschal,</hi> the occasion of this mischief, he being accused and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of Sorcery, was deprived of his Arch-Deaconry; and for Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was confined to a Monastery, whereing after his having continued obstinate for five years, he died. In the mean time <hi>Justinian,</hi> being strangely inconstant towards God and Men, both attaques the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Bulgarians</hi> contrary to the Articles of Peace he had concluded with them; from whom yet it is certain he receiv'd more damage, than he
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50681:80"/>
did to them; and also returning to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> being generally hated by the Citizens for his not restraining the cruelty of the City-prefect, he held a Synod, wherein some Decrees pass'd not agreeing with the Orthodox Faith; which also <hi>Sergius</hi> his <hi>Apocrisiary,</hi> or <hi>Nuntio,,</hi> then residing at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> very foolishly confirmed by his Subscription. But these Decrees being afterwards brought to <hi>Rome</hi> and there exploded by <hi>Sergius,</hi> who held that there were two Natures in Christ, and that the Blessed Virgin was the Mother of God, <hi>Justinian</hi> enraged thereat, sends <hi>Zacharias Protospatharius</hi> (which we may render the Captain of the Guards) to <hi>Rome,</hi> to bring <hi>Sergius</hi> bound to him. Which when the Soldiers of the <hi>Exarchate</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi> understood, they immediately took up their Arms, and not only defended the Pope from violence, but were very near having slain <hi>Zachary,</hi> had he not saved himself by flying for refuge to the Pope, who kept him for some time in his Bed-chamber, and afterwards sent him back privately to the Emperour. While these things were transacted at <hi>Rome, Leontius,</hi> encouraged by <hi>

                  </hi> the Patriarch, having excited the People of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to take up Arms, and broke open all the Prisons of the City, whereby multitudes of Prisoners were set at liberty, deposes <hi>Justinian,</hi> and cutting off his Nose banishes him to the <hi>Chersonese</hi> of <hi>Pontus. Abimelech</hi> Admiral of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> having intelligence hereof, and hoping to make his advantage of these Tumults, presently invades <hi>Africa;</hi> whither <hi>Leontius</hi> with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition sends his Army to check their motion. But not long after a mutiny arising among the Soldiers, they create one <hi>Tiberius</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Constantinople</hi> Emperour; who immediately returning with the Army to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> seizes <hi>Leontius,</hi> and having retaliated upon him what we have said he did to <hi>Justinian,</hi> throws him into Prison, reserving him there for future greater ignominy. Moreover, he banished <hi>Philip</hi> the son of <hi>Nicephorus</hi> a <hi>Patrician,</hi> and one who had been assistant to him in getting the Empire, only because he had told his Companions how he dreamt that he saw an Eagle covering his head with her Wings; which <hi>Tiberius</hi> fear'd might be a presage of the young man's coming to the Empire. While things went thus at <hi>Constantinople, Pipin</hi> Duke of <hi>Austrasia</hi> laid the foundation of gaining the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> For understanding that one <hi>Bertarius,</hi> a mean fellow whom King <hi>Theodoric</hi> made use of as his chief Minister, was generally hated by all People, he marches with a vast Army into <hi>France,</hi> and being encountred in his passage by <hi>Theodoric</hi> and <hi>Bertarius,</hi> he engages in Battel with them and defeats them. <hi>Bertarius</hi> saved himself by flight; but <hi>Theodoric</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, by agreement upon a Truce constitutes the victorious <hi>Pipin Mayre</hi> of the Palace, and principal Administratour of his Kingdom. After this <hi>Pipin</hi> returned to <hi>Austrasia</hi> upon intelligence that the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Sueves</hi> infested his People; and having quell'd them, he sets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards <hi>France</hi> again, upon the News that <hi>Theodoric</hi> being dead, the Kingdom had fallen to his Brother <hi>Childepert.</hi> Arriving there, and being very kindly received by the King, after he had put his son into the place of <hi>Mayre</hi> of the Palace, he again returns enraged at the <hi>Sueves</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> who were now the second time in Arms.</p>

Leo</hi> had hitherto lain less regarded than his merits required, he reposited it in a more honourable and celebrated place. The Statues of the Apostles defaced with Age he renew'd, and either repaired or made wholly new the Ornaments of many Churches which it would be tedious to enumerate. Moreover, he ordained that at the breaking of the body of our Lord should be sung, <hi>O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the World, have mercy upon us;</hi> and that on the day of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin, and of <hi>S. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> there should be yearly a Procession with Litanies through the City, setting out at <hi>S. Hadrian.</hi> He made <hi>Damianus</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and <hi>Berslauardus</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Britain.</hi> By his Learning and Authority he brought over to the Truth the Church of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> which before consented not wholly to the fifth Synod.

'Tis written also that by the exemplary Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Sergius</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> were now first wrought upon to embrace Christianity. The good man having by these means gained a great reputation; and having been in the Chair thirteen years, eight months, twenty three days, he died, and was with the lamentation of all men, who wept as at the loss of a common Father, with great Solemnity buried in the Church of <hi>S.

Being afterwards or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Deacon, he attended Pope <hi>Constantine</hi> to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> where there being a warm Debate concerning some Articles of Religion, he disputed so smartly, that all men admired his Learning, Wit, and Eloquence, by which he easily confuted those who held any erroneous Opinions. Soon after his being created Pope, he re-built the Walls of the City which in several places were fallen down through age; and repaired the decayed Churches of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Laurence</hi> without the Walls, laying in the Water anew, by mending the battered and disjoyned Pipes which formerly had conveyed it into them. He repaired also, and enriched with Presents of Gold and Silver divers other Churches, which it would be tedious to enumerate. Yet I will not pass by in Silence his reviving a Monastery in the <hi>Via Ostiensis</hi> not far from S. <hi>Paul'</hi>s, whose Ruines are yet to be seen, and also that of S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> setling Monks therein who were to be continually employed in the exercise of Devotion. Moreover, it was the peculiar Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Pope, that through his means the <hi>Germans</hi> were converted to Christianity; he having sent among them <hi>Boniface</hi> a Monk, to bring them out of darkness by setting up the light of the Truth. Of these <hi>Germans</hi> a great number came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and were baptized with the Popes own Hands. He also by his Authority compelled <hi>Luithprandus,</hi>

who at first resused it, to confirm the Donation of <hi>Arithpertus,</hi> of which we have spoken before; which <hi>Luithprandus</hi> did at the beginning of his Reign both possess himself of a great part of <hi>Boiaria,</hi> and also besiege and take <hi>

                     </gap>.</hi> In the time of this Pope there was such an Inundation of the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> which flowed into the City through the <hi>Porta del popolo,</hi> that in the <hi>Via Lata</hi> the Water was almost a mans height, and from <hi>Ponte Molle</hi> to the Steps of S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s men rowed about in large Boats. This Inundation continued seven days to the great Loss and Damage of the Citizens, it having born down Houses, and rooted up Trees, Corn, Plants and Herbs. The Moon also being now in an Ecclipse, appeared of a bloody colour till midnight; and there was seen a Comet, with its Tail extending towards the North, betokening some future Calamity. Whereupon <hi>Gregory,</hi> that he might avert the displeasure of Almighty God from the Christians, ordered frequent Litanies in Procession through the whole City. While the Pope was thus employed at <hi>Rome,</hi> there came Advice, that the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Beneventum</hi> had surpriz'd the Fort of <hi>Cuma;</hi> at which <hi>Gregory</hi> being very much disturbed, sends to admonish them to restore this Fort which contrary to the Articles of Peace they had unjustly possess'd themselves of, or otherwise they would soon feel the Indignation of Almighty God upon them. But after several Messages of the like nature they not quitting it, he encourages the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> upon the promise of a sum of Money, and the sending some <hi>Roman</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for their assistance, to recover it by Force. <hi>Theodunus</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Deacon having the management of this Affair, the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> set briskly to the Work, and re-take the Fort, killing three hundred of those who were in Garrison therein, and taking five hundred Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whom they carried to <hi>Naples,</hi> where the Soldiers forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the reward which had been promised them. <hi>Gregory</hi> now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Peace, applyed himself to Church-work. For he repaired the Church of <hi>S. Cross</hi> in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which had long lain neglected, and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch'd and roof'd the Porches on every side of it; he built from the foundations the Oratory of S. <hi>Susanna</hi> on Mount <hi>Coelius;</hi> and after the Death of his Mother dedicated his Fathers House to the honour of S. <hi>Agatha,</hi> building it into a Monastery, which he plentifully endowed for the maintenance of the Monks therein.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Saracens</hi> now encouraged by the Discord they observed among the Christians, setting sail from <hi>Septa</hi> in <hi>Afrique,</hi> and arriving in <hi>Spain,</hi> ravage all the Countrey, except <hi>Granada</hi> which was inhabited by those of their own Nation already, and at length with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren pass as far as <hi>Aquitain,</hi> designing to possess themselves of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince also. <hi>Charles Martell</hi> the Son of <hi>Pipin</hi> was at this time famous<note place="margin">Charles Martell.</note> throughout the World. This <hi>Pipin,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Grimoald,</hi> had two other Sons left, <hi>Caroloman</hi> and <hi>Charles Martell;</hi> which <hi>Charles,</hi> this Brother also dying, gain'd afterwards to himself the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> though not without great opposition, especially of <hi>Eudo</hi> Duke of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>Chilperic</hi> whom some of the <hi>French</hi> upon the Death of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doric</hi> had set up to be their King. But <hi>Martell</hi> having passed the River <hi>Seine,</hi> and advanced to <hi>Orleans,</hi> at the first Attaque puts them to flight, and becomes sole Possessour of the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> After this he passed the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and conquered the <hi>Saxons, Alemans, Sueves</hi> and <hi>Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arians.</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:50681:84"/>
But having Intelligence that the <hi>Saracens</hi> had been invited by <hi>Eudo</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> by great Marches he comes forth against them, and obliging them to fight, gains a mighty Victory not far from <hi>Tours.</hi> Historians write that in this Battel there were slain of the <hi>Saracens</hi> three hundred and sixty thousand, but of the <hi>French</hi> only one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand one hundred and fifty, and 'tis said, that <hi>Eudo</hi> hereupon came over to <hi>Martel'</hi>s side. The <hi>Saracens</hi> being by this means through <hi>Martel'</hi>s Valour diverted from any farther Attempts upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> turn all the Rage and Indignation which upon so great an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw had been raised in them, upon the <hi>Constantinopolitans,</hi> whose City they besieged by Sea and Land the space of three years. But suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the extremities of War, being pinched with Hunger and Cold, and a Pestilence moreover raging among them, they raised the Siege, and return'd home. 'Tis said, that of this Plague there died in <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> three hundred thousand. As for the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> now under the Conduct of <hi>Luithprandus</hi> after a long Siege took and sack'd <hi>Ravenna,</hi> carrying away from thence to <hi>Pavia</hi> all things of considerable value, and amongst the rest, as I believe, the famous Statue on Horseback in Brass. Thus according to the usual Vicissitude of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs, it so fell out, that what <hi>Theodoric</hi> and other Kings of the <hi>Goths,</hi> and after them the <hi>Exarchs,</hi> had taken from <hi>Rome</hi> and carried to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> was by others afterwards scattered about and dispersed into several places. In the mean time there was at <hi>Rome</hi> a Plot laid by some seditious people against the Pope; the Heads of the Conspiracy being <hi>Basilius, Jordanus</hi> a Notary, <hi>John</hi> a Sub-deacon surnamed <hi>Lurion</hi> and <hi>Marinus</hi> an Officer of the Guards, who at this time was Governour of <hi>Rome</hi> under the Emperour. But upon the Emperour's recalling <hi>Marinus,</hi> the business was deferred to another time. The Conspiratours tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red also with <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Exarch,</hi> being willing in a matter of so great importance to have him to head them. The whole Design being at length discovered by the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> they appear in Arms, kill <hi>John Lurion,</hi> and dissipate the other Conspiratours. <hi>Basilius</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a Monastery, where he died. The forementioned <hi>Paul</hi> being highly enraged at the Pope for prohibiting his levying new Taxes, did by the Emperour's Order seek all ways, both secret and open, of taking away the good mans life; but the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> taking up Arms defended him. The Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> hereupon publishes an Edict, commanding all those who were Subjects of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire to rase out and take away all the Pictures and Images of Saints, Martyrs and Angels out of their Churches; with design, as he ptofessed, thereby to prevent Idolatry; and declaring, that whosoever refused so to do should be accounted a publick Enemy. But <hi>Gregory</hi> not only not obeyed this Order, but also encouraged all Catholicks to stand up stoutly against it. Whereupon the people of <hi>Italy</hi> were so animated, that they were near chusing another Emperour, had not <hi>Gregory</hi> by his authority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed to prevent it. Notwithstanding which there arose such a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> some pleading for Obedience to the Emperour, others to the Pope, that <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Exarch,</hi> together with his Son, was slam in the Tumult. To succeed in whose place the Emperour sends <hi>Eutychius</hi> an Eunuch, who by Gifts and Promises was to endeavour to break the Friendship and Alliance between the <hi>Lombards</hi> and the Pope.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50681:84"/>
But that Attempt having been often made in vain, was drop'd for a time; and the Pope being freed of this trouble, began to visit the Hospitals and Churches, and to repair those of them which through age or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect had fallen to decay. Moreover, he made a Peace between the King of the <hi>Lombards</hi> and the Dukes of <hi>Spoleto</hi> and <hi>Beneventum,</hi> which that King had intended to crush; but having marched in a peaceable manner as far as <hi>Rome</hi> to confer with the Pope about the matter, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> by his Christian Counsel so mollified his mind, that laying aside all thoughts of War, he offered up his Sword, and other Arms, in the Church of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> now in another wild humour, commanded all the Images, either of Wood, Brass or Marble to be brought to him, which he forthwith caused to be burnt; and seiz'd upon and put to Death those who refused to bring them. <hi>Germanus</hi> the Patriarch, who vigorously opposed it, he banished, and put into his place <hi>Anastasius</hi> an Heretick; whom <hi>Gregory</hi> afterwards in a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod deprived, and interdicted the Exercise of sacred Offices, if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to return to the Catholick Faith. Furthermore, as became a pious Prelate, he oftentimes by Letters admonished the Emperour to quit the erroneous Opinions into which some ill men had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him, and at length to embrace the Truth, and to cease the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of the Images of the Saints, by whose Example and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory men might be excited to the Imitation of their Virtues. Some write that in this Popes time <hi>Boniface</hi> came out of <hi>Britain</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and for his sanctity was of a Monk made a Bishop, and sent into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> that by his Preaching and Example he might confirm that People in the Faith; which he performed so well, that he was deservedly made Bishop of <hi>Mentz;</hi> but passing thence into <hi>Africa,</hi> he was for his preaching the Word of God put to Death by the Enemies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. 'Tis said also, that S. <hi>Aegidius,</hi> a <hi>Grecian,</hi> was now famous for the holy Life he led, and the miracles he wrought; and that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronax,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Brescia,</hi> did by Vow repair at his own Charge the Monastery of S. <hi>Benedict,</hi> which was almost quite left desolate. As for <hi>Gregory,</hi> who by his good Example excited all men to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Piety and Virtue, having been in the Chair sixteen years, nine months, eleven days, he died, and was buried in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s, <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> the 11th. By his Death the See was vacant thirty five days. He is said to have consecrated during his Pontificate one hundred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight Bishops.</p>

Finally, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards all men was such, that he cherished and relieved the Poor, redeemed Captives, releas'd insolvent Debtours, and asserted the Cause of Widows and Orphans against potent Oppressours in such a manner, that he deserved the Name of a common Father and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Soon after his entrance upon the Pontificate, with the Consent of the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> he excommunicated and deposed the Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> for his having rased the Pictures of the Saints out of the Churches and destroyed their Images, and also for not being Orthodox in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning the Consubstantiality of the Son with the Father.

He built also an Oratory in the same Church, in which he reposited some of the Reliques of almost all the Saints, and ordered Mass to be therein daily performed, in the Canon of which he added these words, which were engraven upon the Marble round the Oratory, <hi>Quorum Solennitas in conspectu tuoe Majeslatis celebratur, Domine Deus noster, toto in Orbe terrarum. &amp;c.</hi> i. e. <hi>Whose Anniversaries are celebrated in the sight of thy Majesty, O Lord our God, throughout all the World,</hi> &amp;c. which Clause is not in the general Canon now used.

For he was a Person of a very mild Disposition, and wonderfully sweet Conversation; every way deserving; a Lover of the Clergy and People of <hi>Rome;</hi> slow to Anger, but very forward to exercise Mercy and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency; rendring to no man evil for evil, but in Imitation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour overcoming evil with good, and that to such a degree, that after his arriving to the Papal Dignity he preferred and enriched those who had envied and hated him. At the beginning of his Pontificate find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Italy</hi> enflamed in War, in order to procure a Peace he forthwith sends Legates to <hi>Luithprandus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> who now made War upon <hi>Transamundus</hi> Duke of <hi>Spoleto.</hi> But these Legates not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the Design, he himself goes in person, accompanied with the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, into <hi>Sabina;</hi> and 'tis said that in sign of honour the King met him eight miles from <hi>Narni,</hi> and alighting off his Horse, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him on Foot into the City. The day following, while they were at Mass, the Pope made publickly an Elegant Oration, wherein he set forth the Duty of a Christian King both in the time of Peace and War; and 'tis reported that the King was so wrought upon by it, that he presently put the sole Power of accommodating matters into the Pope's hands. The King had already deposed <hi>Transamund,</hi> and invested <hi>Agrandus,</hi> his Nephew, in the Dukedom. Yet at the Pope's Intercession <hi>Transamund</hi> was received into favour; but he quitting all Pretensions to the Dukedom, entred into holy Orders. All the Towns which had been taken in <hi>Sabina</hi> were restored; as also <hi>Narni</hi> and <hi>Anco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and whatever places the <hi>Lombards</hi> had for thirty years past made themselves Masters of in <hi>Tuscany.</hi> Moreover, all who had been made Prisoners during the War were set at Liberty. <hi>Luithprandus,</hi> having been treated by the Pope with all imaginable expressions of Indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Respect, marched thence peaceably with his Army, and not long after died, in the thirty second year of his Reign. He was a person who deserved that Kingdom both for his extraordinary Wisdom
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50681:86"/>
and Prudence, and also for his Valour and warlike Temper, in which no man excell'd him; so eminent also for Justice and Clemency, that it is hard to judg whether of these two Vertues were more conspicuous in him. His Nephew, <hi>Aldeprandus,</hi> succeeded him in the Kingdom, which having held only six months he also died; and Duke <hi>Rachis,</hi> a Prince whose Piety and Integrity deserve the highest praise, was unanimously chosen in his stead. By him also a League was renewed with the Pope, to whose Legates the devout and religious King graciously granted whatever they desired. But having reigned four years, he quitted his Government, and betook himself to a Monastick Life, encouraging his Wife and his Sons to do the like. His Brother <hi>Aistulphus</hi> succeeded him, whose crafty and fierce Temper threatned disturbance to all <hi>Italy,</hi> but especially to the Pope and the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom he designed by Force to bring under his Jurisdiction. In the mean time <hi>Charles Martel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seiz'd with a violent sickness, at the persuasion of his Friends divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Acquests between his two Sons; of whom <hi>Caroloman,</hi> the elder, had <hi>Austrasia</hi> and <hi>Suevia,</hi> and <hi>

The Tower and Portico before the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church he built from the ground, made the Windows and Gates of Brass, and upon the Frontispiece of the Portico caused a Map of the World to be delineated. He renewed the defaced Images of the Saints; enlarged and beautified the <hi>Lateran</hi> Palace; repaired the <hi>Palatine</hi> Library, and assigned to every Church a Revenue for the maintenance of Oyl for their Lamps. He gave to <hi>S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'</hi>s an Altar-Cloth embroidered with Gold and set with Jewels, having the Essigies of our Blessed Saviour wrought upon it. He built the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50681:87"/>
Church of <hi>S. George</hi> in <hi>Velabro,</hi> and reposited the head of that Saint therein; as also the Church of S. <hi>Coecilia,</hi> in the <hi>Via Tiburtina,</hi> six miles from the City, and in it an Oratory in honour to S. <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Abbat; setling a maintenance for the Priests that ministred in it. He re-built the Roof of the Church of S. <hi>Eusebius,</hi> which happened in his time to tumble down. He also gave order that his Servants should daily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute and give out at the <hi>Lateran</hi> Palace Alms to the Poor of all sorts. Moreover, he forbad the <hi>Venetians,</hi> upon pain of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the selling of Christian Slaves to <hi>Saracens</hi> and Heathens, which those Merchants were before wont to do. Finally, that we may not think that his Advancement to so great a Dignity made him neglect his Studies, he translated out of <hi>Latin</hi> into <hi>Greek</hi> four Books of <hi>Gregory</hi> in Dialogue; that so the <hi>Grecians</hi> might be instructed in the Rules of good living. But having with such Integrity to the Satisfaction of all men governed the Church ten years, three months, he died, and was buried in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s, <hi>March</hi> the 15th.

After whom our <hi>Stephen</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, (for we reckon not his short-liv'd Predecessour of that name in the List) was unanimously elected by the Clergy and People in the Church of S. <hi>Mary ad Proesepe,</hi> and being highly beloved by all was carried upon mens shoulders to S. <hi>Saviour'</hi>s, called also the <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Church, and from thence into the <hi>Lateran</hi> Palace.

For <hi>Aistulphus</hi> now making Inrodes upon the Borders of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he at first endeavoured by Persuasions and Presents to bring him off. But that covetous Prince requiring the payment of a Tribute of so much a head yearly from the People, the Pope thereupon was forced to seek for help from abroad, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he sent Nuntio's to <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to desire Aid of him against <hi>Aistulphus,</hi> who gave disturbance to all <hi>Italy,</hi> and had already taken <hi>Ravenna</hi> the Seat of the <hi>Exarchate,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Romagna.</hi> But finding no hope of succours from him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to go to <hi>Pipin</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> and therefore sends to that King to desire that he would prevail with <hi>Aistulphus</hi> to permit him safe passage through his Countrey; which <hi>Aistulphus</hi> at <hi>Pipin'</hi>s Request consented

But it not being a fit season of the year to undertake an Expedition, and <hi>Pipin</hi> allowing much to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Friendship there had been between them, he sends Ambassadours to <hi>Aistulphus,</hi> to advise him to restore the Places he had taken, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to let him know that he should be obliged in a short time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them by force of Arms. <hi>Aistulphus</hi> hearkned not to this good Counsel; whereupon <hi>Pipin,</hi> the Spring now approaching, advances with an Army against the <hi>Lombards;</hi> and having sent before some light-har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed Soldiers to force <hi>Aistulphus'</hi>s Guards to quit the Passes of the <hi>Alps,</hi> he marches down into the Plain of the State of <hi>Milain,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving without any opposition sacked and harassed all places he came to, at length he invests <hi>Pavia</hi> the Seat-Royal of the Kings of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which <hi>Aistulphus</hi> and those that were in Garrison with him defended. But <hi>Stephen</hi> moved with Compassion at the numerous Calamities which this obstinate man had brought upon himself and his People, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily offers <hi>Aistulphus</hi> a Peace, upon condition he would restore what he had taken; which <hi>Aistulphus</hi> at length consented to, and promised upon Oath more than was demanded. <hi>Pipin</hi> reckoning that the Pope had now satisfaction, raises the Siege, and returns into <hi>France,</hi> leaving <hi>Varrenus</hi> the Arbitratour of this Peace between them. <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Varrenus</hi> go to <hi>Rome,</hi> not doubting but that <hi>Aistulphus</hi> would in a little time perform his promise; instead of which he presently mustering up from all parts what Forces he could, with a tumultuary Rout rather than a just Army, follows them, and besieges <hi>Rome,</hi> laying waste and burning the Suburbs and Places adjacent, insomuch that the People of <hi>Rome</hi> suffered more Damage by the Outrages he then committed, than they had received in three hundred forty four years before from the declining of the Empire. Hereupon <hi>Pipin</hi> being again sued to by the Pope to aid the distressed City of <hi>Rome</hi> against the Perfidiousness and Cruelty of <hi>Aistulphus,</hi> he with all possible expedition raises an Army for that purpose. In the mean time the <hi>Turks</hi> willing to mend their Quarters, over-run and conquer the <hi>Alanes</hi> first, then the <hi>Colchians</hi> and <hi>Armenians,</hi> after them the People of the Lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> and lastly the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> An.

Some Writers tell us, that these were of the Race of those <hi>Scythians</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> kept within the <hi>Hyperborean</hi> Mountains with Iron-Bars, meaning by that Metaphor, that he had shut up that wild Nation there as into a Prison. But after much mischief done and received on both sides, a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluded between the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks,</hi> it was agreed that the <hi>Turks</hi> which dwelt in <hi>Persia</hi> should be called <hi>Saracens;</hi> and by this means the <hi>Saracens</hi> did more patiently suffer the <hi>Turks</hi> to bear sway

in <hi>Asia,</hi> especially apprehending moreover that they might soon be brought to embrace the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Religion. But we return to <hi>Pipin,</hi> who coming again with his Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> was met by <hi>Gregory</hi> principal Secretary to the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> the fourth; who desired him in his Master's name, that is he should prove victorious over the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards,</hi> he would not give the <hi>Exarchate</hi> of <hi>Ravenna</hi> to the Pope or the <hi>Romans,</hi> it belonging of right to the Emperour. To which <hi>Pipin</hi> answered, that he came into <hi>Italy</hi> to do the Pope and People a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that he should consult their advantage to the utmost of his Power. After this he marched to <hi>Pavia,</hi> and reduced <hi>Aistulphus</hi> to such extremity, that he was forced to accept of the former Conditions of Peace. Hereby the <hi>Exarchate</hi> was restored to the <hi>Romans,</hi> together with all the Tract contained between the <hi>Po</hi> and <hi>Apennine,</hi> from <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centino</hi> to the Gulf of <hi>Venice,</hi> and whateyer lies between the River <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> the <hi>Apennine</hi> and the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> with all that <hi>Aistulphus</hi> had taken in <hi>Tuscany</hi> and <hi>Sabina. Pipin</hi> stayed at the Foot of the <hi>Alps</hi> till Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions should be performed, having left <hi>Holcadus</hi> an Abbat with part of his Army to oblige <hi>Aistulphus</hi> to perform what he had promis'd, and moved no farther till he understood that <hi>Aistulphus</hi> had died of an Apoplexy while he was hunting, before the surrendry was fully made. Upon his Death, <hi>Desiderius,</hi> Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> forthwith raises an Army of <hi>Lombards,</hi> with design to possess himself of the Kingdom. The same also did <hi>Rachis, Aistulphus'</hi>s Brother, who had before, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready said, taken the habit of a Monk; and indeed the <hi>Lombards</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, except those of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> were on his side. But <hi>Desiderius</hi> by making large Promises to the Pope and the <hi>Romans,</hi> wrought them into a favour of his Pretensions; and accordingly they with all speed sent Ambassadours, and among them <hi>Holcadus</hi> the Abbat to <hi>Rachis</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him to lay down his Arms, and submit to <hi>Desiderius.</hi> And so <hi>Faenza</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi> were at last delivered to the Pope, and the name of the <hi>Exarchate,</hi> which had continued from the time of <hi>Narses</hi> to the taking of <hi>Ravenna</hi> by <hi>Aistulphus</hi> an hundred and seventy years, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished. Things being now peaceably setled, and the Jurisdiction of the Church greatly encreased, <hi>Stephen</hi> holding a Synod, takes an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his several Flocks and their Pastors; gently chastises those who had offended; directs such as had gone astray; teaches and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs the ignorant; and finally sets before them the Duty of a Bishop, of a Presbyter, and of all Orders in the Clergy. Moreover, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Litanies for the appeasing of the Divine Anger; the Procession on the first <hi>Saturday</hi> to be to S. <hi>Marie'</hi>s <hi>ad Proesepe,</hi> on the second to S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> on the third to S. <hi>Paul'</hi>s in the <hi>Via Ostiensis.</hi> He also repaired several Churches which had been damaged by <hi>Aistul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> while he layed Siege to the City; yet he did not recover the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the Saints which that King had carried with him to <hi>Pavia,</hi> and there reposited not dishonourably in divers Churches. The good man having by these means proved serviceable to God, his Countrey, and the Church, died in the fifth year and first month of his Pontificate, and was buried <hi>April</hi> the 26th, with general lamentation as for the loss of a Common Father. The See was then vacant thirty two days.</p>

After a long Dispute therefore <hi>Theophylact</hi> was rejected, and <hi>Paul</hi> by general suffrage chosen, in the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Leo.</hi> This <hi>Paul</hi> was a person of an extraordinary meek and merciful Temper, and who in Imitation of our Saviour never returned to any man evil for evil, but on the contrary by doing good to them he overcame those ill men that had oftentimes injur'd him. He was of so kind and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate a Nature, as that he would go about by night with only two or three Attendants to the Houses of poor sick people, assisting them with his Counsel, and relieving them with his Alms. He also frequently visited the Prisons, and paying their Creditors, discharged thence multitudes of poor Debtours. The Fatherless and Widows that were over-reach'd by the tricks of Lawyers he defended by his Authority and supported by his Charity. Moreover, having assembled the Clergy and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> he did with great solemnity translate the Body of S. <hi>Petronilla</hi> S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Daughter, with her Tomb of Marble upon which was this Inscription, <hi>Petronilloe Filioe dulcissimoe,</hi> from the <hi>Via Appia</hi> into the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and placed it at the upper end of the Church dedicated to her Father. At this time the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> having in all places plucked down the Images, and put to death <hi>Constantine</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for opposing him therein, and made <hi>Nicetas</hi> an Eunuch, his Abettour in the Sacriledg, Patriach in his stead, the Pope consulting by all means the Interest of Religion, sends Nuntios to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to advise the Emperour to restore and set up again the Images he had taken away, or upon his refusal so to do, to threaten him with the Censure of Excommunication. But <hi>Constantine</hi> persisting obstinately in what he had done, not only despised this good Counsel, but also granted Peace to <hi>Sabinus</hi> King of the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> because he also made the like havock of Images with himself, though he were before engaged in a War against him. Having also associated to himself into part of the Empire his Son <hi>Leo</hi> the fourth, whom he had married to the most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Athenian</hi> Lady <hi>Irene,</hi> he enters into a League with the <hi>Saracens,</hi> thereby to despite and provoke the Orthodox Christians. In the mean time <hi>Pipin</hi> entirely subdues <hi>Taxillo</hi> Duke of the <hi>Bojarians,</hi> and admits of a League with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> but upon this Condition, that they should be obliged to send three hundred Horsemen to his Assistance as often as he should have occasion to make an Expedition. Against the <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:50681:89"/>
he maintained a tedious War, which at length he committed to the management of his young Son <hi>Charles,</hi> himself being so worn out with Age that he could not be present at it. This War being ended, <hi>Charles</hi> takes by Storm <hi>Bourbon, Clermont,</hi> and several other Towns of <hi>Auvergne.</hi> But <hi>Pipin,</hi> who as we have said was now very old, not long after dies, leaving in the Kingdom his two Sons <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Caroloman.</hi> Some tell us that <hi>Aistulphus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> who, as is above declared, had carried away the Bodies of divers Saints from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Pavia,</hi> died at this time; and that he had built Chappels to those Saints, aud also a Cloister for Virgins. in which his own Daughters became Nuns. He was an extraordinary Lover of the Monks, and died in their Arms, in the sixth year and fifth month of his Reign. At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Government, he was fierce and rash, in the end mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and a person of such Learning, that he reduc'd and form'd the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts of the <hi>Lombards</hi> into Laws. He was, as has been said, succeeded by Duke <hi>Desiderius;</hi> the Valour of the <hi>Lombards</hi> beginning now to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve and lose it self in Luxury.

                  <hi>STEPHEN</hi> the third, a <hi>Sicilian,</hi> Son of <hi>Olibrius,</hi> entred upon the Pontificate, <hi>A. D.</hi> 768. a learned man, and in the management of Affairs, especially those belonging to the Church, very active and steddy. Coming to <hi>Rome</hi> very young, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> III. he took Orders and became a Monk in the Monastery of S. <hi>Chrysogonus,</hi> where he was inured to the stricter way of living, and instructed in Ecclesiastical Learning. Being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called by Pope <hi>Zachary</hi> into the <hi>Lateran</hi> Palace, and his Life and Learning generally approved of, he was constituted Parish-Priest of S. <hi>Caetilia;</hi> and for his great Integrity and readiness in Business both <hi>Zachary</hi> and his Successours, <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> would always have him near their Persons. But upon the Death of <hi>Paul,</hi> whom our <hi>Stephen</hi> never deserted to his last Breath, <hi>Desiderius,</hi> who, as we have said, was by the Assistance of <hi>Stephen</hi> II. made King of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> being by <hi>Pipin'</hi>s Death rid of all fear, encourages <hi>Toto</hi> Duke of <hi>Nepi</hi> to promote his Brother <hi>Constantine</hi> to the Pontificate by force of Arms, if he could not compass it by canvassing and bribery. He accordingly marches to <hi>Rome</hi> with an Army, and with the Assistance of some whom he had corrupted and made his Friends by Gifts and Promises, gets <hi>Constantine</hi> to be elected Pope. Indeed there were those who set up one <hi>Philip</hi> against him, but he was presently forced to quit his Pretensions, and <hi>Gregory</hi> Bishop of <hi>Praeneste</hi> compelled to initiate <hi>Constantine,</hi> who at the time of his choice was a Laick, into holy Orders, and then to consecrate
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50681:89"/>
him Bishop; the hands of which <hi>Gregory</hi> are said thereupon by Miracle to have so withered that he could not reach them to his Mouth. But <hi>Constantine</hi> having persisted to exercise the Papal Function for one year, was at length in great Rage and Disdain deposed by the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> unanimously chosen in his stead. Upon which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> being brought into S. <hi>Saviour'</hi>s Church, and the sacred Canons read, he was publickly and solemnly divested of the Pontifical Habit, and commanded to lead a private life in a Monastery. After this, <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> being consecrated by three Bishops in the Church of S. <hi>Adrian,</hi> and saluted as the true Pope by all the Clergy and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himself to the censuring and suppressing of the Practices of some ill men who endeavoured to break the Unity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Therefore calling a Council, he writes to <hi>Charles</hi> desiring him to send to <hi>Rome,</hi> as soon as might be, some Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> by their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Integrity well qualified for the Affair. The same also he writes to the other Christian Princes; who all complying with him therein, a Council is held in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church, where the Fathers having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed among themselves divers things tending to the setling of the Church, they ordered <hi>Constantine</hi> to be brought before them. For the underhand-dealings of <hi>Desiderius</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and <hi>Paul A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiarta</hi> having occasioned frequent tumults among the People; <hi>Desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derius</hi> endeavouring all he could to alienate the Affections of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> from <hi>Charles</hi> to the Emperour; hereupon several were killed on both sides, and <hi>Constantine,</hi> the occasion of all the mischief, had his Eyes put out by the contrary Faction, though <hi>Stephen</hi> declared against it, and did what he could to prevent it; but there is no opposing a furious, enraged Multitude. <hi>Constantine</hi> appearing before the Council, and being accused that he had usurped the Apostolick See not being in any holy Orders, lays all the fault upon the People, and especially upon some particular Persons who forced him against his Will to take the Pontificate upon him. Then prostrating himself upon the floor, and humbly begging Pardon, the persons present moved with Compassion, ordered him to be dismissed, and put off the Debate of his whole Case to the next day, intending then more maturely to deliberate what ought to be done in the matter. But the next day <hi>Constantine</hi> returning to the Council, was quite of another mind, and remonstrated that he had Precedents of former Prelates for what he had done; that <hi>Sergius</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bishop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> had been of Laicks conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Bishops. The Fathers resenting this Impudence, caused him to be cast out with Disgrace, and having nulled his Decrees, applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the setling of the State of Christianity. Among other things it was unanimously decreed by them, That no Laick, but such only as had pass'd through the several Degrees in the Clergy, should presume to take the Popedom, upon pain of Excommunication. It was ordained likewise, that those who had attained to the Episcopal Dignity in the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> should renounce that Character, and fall back into the same Rank and Order which they were of before; but with this Reserve, that if their Life and Doctrine were approved by the People, it then pleased the Council, that upon their application to the Apostolick See, they might be consecrated anew. The same was judged meet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Presbyters and Deacons; yet it was forbidden that any of them
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50681:90"/>
should arrive to the greater Degrees, upon a Jealousie, as I believe, lest some Errour or Sect might thence arise, as from a Seminary of Discord and Sedition. Moreover it was decreed, that all the sacred Offices which <hi>Constantine</hi> had performed, should be deemed null, except only Baptism and Confirmation. Finally, having made void the <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Synod, in which the <hi>Greek</hi> Prelates had decreed that the Pictures and Statues of the Saints should be defaced and thrown out of Churches, it was ordained that those Images should be in all places <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and an <hi>Anathema</hi> pass'd upon that execrable and pernicious Synod, by which the condition of the Immortal God was rendred worse than that of Men; it being allowed us to erect the Statues of men who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served well of the Publick, both for the expressing of our Gratitude, and the raising our Emulation of their brave Deeds, but forbidden to set up the Image of our Saviour, whom we ought if it were possible to have always before our Eyes, whether we consider the mighty Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations he has laid upon Mankind, or the Dignity of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. These things having thus pass'd according to the Popes mind, it was Decreed, that on the following day there should be a Solemn Procession, both to return thanks to God, and also in order to the averting of his Displeasure. This Procession was made from the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church to S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s, with universal great Devotion, the Pope himself, with all that were present, walking Bare-foot. But in our times Piety and Devotion are grown so cold, that such Expressions of Humility are not only laid aside, but men are so proud as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

What should I say further? the more petulant and full of Buffoonry any one is, the more he is commended in such a corrupt Age.

                  </gap> Religion does daily suffer and decline.

This <hi>Charles</hi> performed with great diligence, though he were not in a condition to restrain the <hi>Lombard</hi> by Force, because upon the Death of his Brother, who had reign'd jointly and amicably with him for two years, he was necessarily engaged in several Wars at once.

Towards <hi>Desiderius</hi> howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was so favourable, as that though he berest him of his Kingdom, yet he spared his Life, and only confined him with his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to <hi>Lyons.</hi> Advancing thence again <hi>Arachis</hi> Duke of <hi>Benevent,</hi> who was Son-in-law to <hi>Desiderius,</hi> and had been an Abettour of his rash Proceedings, he soon forced him to sue for a Peace, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his two Sons for Hostages. After this in his Passage farther he religiously visited Mount <hi>Cassino,</hi> and confirmed all the Grants which had been made by other Princes to the Monastery of S. <hi>Benedict.</hi> And so the Affairs of all <hi>Italy</hi> being composed, and strong Guards left in the most important places of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> he returns with great Spoil and mighty Glory into his Kingdom or <hi>France,</hi> carrying with him his Brother <hi>Caroloman'</hi>s Relict and Sons, whom he always treated with Respect and Honour; and also <hi>Paul</hi> a Deacon of the Church of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia,</hi> a Person for his Parts and Learning highly belov'd by <hi>Desiderius,</hi> to whom he gave his Freedom, and had for some time a great Esteem for him. But understanding afterwards that the man was assisting to a Design of <hi>Desiderius'</hi>s his Flight, he banish'd him into the Island of <hi>Tremiti;</hi> from whence after some years making his Escape, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Arachis,</hi> at the Request of <hi>Adelperga</hi> Daughter to <hi>Desiderius</hi> and the Wife of <hi>Arachis,</hi> he added two Books to the History of <hi>Eutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi> giving an account of what passed from the time of the Emperour <hi>Julian</hi> to that of <hi>Justinian</hi> the first. After the Death of <hi>Arachis,</hi> he betook himself to the Monastery of <hi>Cassino,</hi> where leading the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his life very devoutly, he oftentimes wrote elegant and obliging Letters to <hi>Charles,</hi> and received again the like from that King, who had preserved him for the sake of his Learning. Thus ended the Kingdom of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> in the two hundred and fourth year after their coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the year of our Lord seven hundred se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty six. <hi>Charles</hi> now without any delay marches against the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous <hi>Saxons,</hi> who during his absence in <hi>Italy</hi> had rebelled; uttterly subdues that People, with whom he had been engaged in War for thirty years before, and compells them to receive Christianity. Then turning his Army against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were also fallen away from the Faith, he took the Cities of <hi>Pampelona</hi> and <hi>Saragoza,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Souldiers to plunder them; not granting a Peace to these <hi>Spaniards,</hi> but upon condition they would entirely embrace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine. After this returning into <hi>France,</hi> matters having went according to his mind, as he passed the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Hills he fell into an Ambuscade of the <hi>Gascons,</hi> in engaging with whom though he gallantly defended himself, yet he lost <hi>Anselmus</hi> and <hi>Egibardus</hi> two brave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders.

Some tell us that in this Encounter <hi>Rolandus, Charles'</hi>s Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's Son, perished, after he had made a great slaughter of the Enemy; though whether he died of Thirst, as is commonly said, or of the wounds he received, is uncertain. At length these <hi>Gascons</hi> were vanquished by <hi>Charles,</hi> and received from him the deserved Punishment of their Revolt and Perfidy. At this time <hi>Taxillo</hi> Duke of <hi>Bojaria, Desiderius'</hi>s Son-in-law, having gained the <hi>Huns</hi> to be on his side, made an Attempt of War against the <hi>French,</hi> which yet <hi>Charles</hi> by his great Expedition al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most made an end of before it was quite begun; and to him also, upon Hostages given, he granted a Peace. While these things were transacting in <hi>France, Constantine</hi> Emperour of the <hi>East,</hi> was seized with a Leprosy, (from whence perhaps arose the groundless Opinion of the Leprosy of <hi>Constantine</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> through the confusion of their Names) and dying left <hi>Leo</hi> the fourth his Successour; who so strangely doated upon precious Stones, that robbing the Church of S. <hi>Sophia</hi> of its Jewels, he made with them a Crown of a vast weight and value, which he wore so often, that either through the Weight, or from the coldness of the Stones in it, he shortly fell sick and died. The same I believe to have happened in our Time to <hi>Paul</hi> the Second, who so effeminately prided himself in such Ornaments, almost exhausting the Treasury of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But young <hi>Constantine,</hi> through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion of some ill men about him, treading in the Footsteps of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, soon after revoked this Constitution, and wholly deprived his Mother of any share in the Administration of Affairs. Then putting away his Wife, he received to his Bed, and caused to be crowned Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, <hi>Theodora</hi> one of her Maids. Moreover, he gave Order to those Commanders he had in <hi>Italy,</hi> to give disturbance to their Neighbours; but they were at the first Message terrified from any Attempts by the prevailing Authority of <hi>Charles,</hi> who at this time was advancing with his Forces against the <hi>Sclaves</hi> and <hi>Hunns,</hi> (or we may call them <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>) because by their Incursions they had molested all the Countrey about the <hi>Danow;</hi> whom having vanquished, he marched into <hi>Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> the Countrey of his Ancestours, from whence the <hi>Franks</hi> or <hi>French</hi> derive their Name; which Province he having with ease brought to his Devotion, two years after <hi>Theophylact</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> two Bishops of great Note held a Synod of <hi>Frank</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Bishops, wherein that which the <hi>Greeks</hi> called the Seventh Synod, and the <hi>Felician</hi> Heresie touching the Destruction of Images, was condemned. <hi>Adrian</hi> being now by the Interest and Power of <hi>Charles</hi> secured from the fear of any warlike In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions, applies himself to the repairing the City, beautifying the Churches, restoring the Aqueducts, and such like publick Works, which I need not particularly enumerate, performed at his vast Expence. But

while he was employed in these matters, there happened such an Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the River <hi>Tyber,</hi> as bore down a principal Gate, and Bridg, and several Buildings of the City, and did otherwise great Damage. In this Extremity <hi>Adrian</hi> took care to send Boats to convey Provisions to such as while the Waters were so high could not stir out of their Houses. And afterwards he comforted with his Advice, and support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Charity, the principal sufferers in that Calamity; nor did he spare any Cost in repairing the publick Loss.

                  <hi>LEO</hi> the third, a <hi>Roman,</hi> Son of <hi>Azzupius,</hi> was upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Merit advanced to the Pontificate, having been from his Youth so throughly educated and instructed in Ecclesiastical Learning, that he deserved to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others. A modest, upright, and well-spoken Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and such a Favourer of learned Men, that he encouraged them by the Proposal of generous Rewards to resort from all Parts to him, and was wonderfully pleased with their Conversation. Moreover, to visit and exhort the sick, to relieve the Poor, to comfort the dejected, and, to reduce the erroneous by his Preaching and Admonition, in which through his Art and Eloquence he had gained a great Perfection, was his peculiar Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He was naturally of a meek Temper, a Lover of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, slow to Anger, ready to commiserate, eminent for Piety, and a vigorous Promoter and Defender of the Honour of God and his Church. Hereupon he was (as I have said) unanimously elected to the Papal See on S. <hi>Stephen'</hi>s day, and the day following with general Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions seated in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Chair. At this time <hi>Irene,</hi> Mother of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Emperour, not being able to bear her Son's ill Courses, and being instigated thereto by certain of the Citizens, returns to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> puts out his Eyes, and throws him into Prison, where as an undutiful Son he miserably ended his days. In the mean time <hi>Charles</hi> having Disturbance given him on many sides, sends his Son <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> against the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> whom having worsted in several Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he at length totally subdued. <hi>Adelphonsus</hi> likewise King of <hi>Asturia</hi> and <hi>Gallicia,</hi> having received Auxiliary Forces from <hi>Charles,</hi> vanquished the <hi>Saracens</hi> and took <hi>Lisbon;</hi> upon the hearing of which Victory of his, the Garrison of <hi>Barcelona</hi> forthwith yielded up to <hi>Charles.</hi> Moreover, the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> who made Inroads upon the Inhabitants of <hi>Friuli,</hi> were now overcome by <hi>Henry, Charle'</hi>s Lieutenant there.

But <hi>Charles</hi> deferring the debate of the matter to another time, sends the Pope to <hi>Rome</hi> with an honourable Retinue, promising that himself would be there in a little time, in order to the composing of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Italy. Leo</hi> in his passage being come as far as <hi>Ponte Molle,</hi> was there in Honour met by the Clergy and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated his Return, and introduced him into the City. And <hi>Charles</hi> without making any long stay, passing through <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Noremberg</hi> into <hi>Friuli,</hi> severely chastises the Citizens of <hi>Treviso</hi> for having put to Death <hi>Henry</hi> their Governour; and having constituted another to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in that Office, he thence goes first to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and presently after to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his Presence was earnestly desired and expected. At his Entrance into the City all imaginable expressions of Honour, as good reason was, were made to him. On the eighth day of his being there, in the presence of the People and Clergy, assembled in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church, he asked all the Bishops, who had come thither out of all the parts of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> what their Opinion was concerning the Life aud Conversation of the Pope. But Answer was made by all with one Voice, that the Apostolick See, the Head of all Churches, ought to be judged by none, especially not by a Laick. Hereupon, <hi>Charles</hi> laying aside any farther Enquiry into the matter, Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> who extreamly wished that he might be put upon that way of purging himself, going up into the Pulpit, and holding the Gospels in his hands, declared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Oath that he was innocent of all those things which were laid to his Charge. This was done on the thirteenth day of <hi>December,</hi> A. D. 800. While things went thus at <hi>Rome, Pipin</hi> by his Fathers Order advancing against the <hi>Beneventans,</hi> who under <hi>Grimoald'</hi>s Conduct made Inroads upon their Neighbours, and having given them so many Defeats, that at length they were scarce able to defend themselves within the Walls of their City; he left the farther management of that War to <hi>Vinigisius</hi> Duke of <hi>Spoleto,</hi> and returned to his Father, who was now in a short time to be crowned Emperour. For the Pope, that he might make some Requital to <hi>Charles</hi> who had deserved so well of the Church, and also because he saw that the Emperours of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> were hardly able to maintain that Title; upon which account <hi>Rome</hi> and all <hi>Italy</hi> had suffered great Calamities; after Mass in S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'</hi>s Church, with the Consent and at the Request of the People of

                  <hi>Rome,</hi> declares with a loud Voice the said <hi>Charles</hi> to be Emperour, and put the Imperial Diadem upon his Head, the People repeating thrice this Acclamation, <hi>Long Life and Victory to</hi> Charles Augustus, <hi>whom God has Crowned, the Great and Pacifick Emperour.</hi> Then the Pope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed him, and his Son <hi>Pipin,</hi> whom in like manner he pronounced King of <hi>Italy. Charles</hi> being now invested with Imperial Power, gave Order that <hi>Campulus</hi> and <hi>Paschal,</hi> the Conspiratours against the Pope, should be put to Death; but the Pope, who was all Clemency, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Pardon of their Lives, and they were only banished into <hi>France.</hi> After this, there were some who would have persuaded <hi>Charles</hi> to ex pell all the <hi>Lombards</hi> out of <hi>Italy.</hi> But that not appearing to be a safe course, because they had mingled in Bloud and Affinity with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Families in <hi>Italy,</hi> it was determined both by <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Leo,</hi> that the Name of <hi>Lombard</hi> should remain there only, where that Nation had chiefly had their Seat. <hi>Pipin</hi> being now returned to <hi>Bonevent,</hi> and having continued the Siege of that place for several months without success, he turns his Arms against the City <hi>Chieti,</hi> of which having after some Opposition made himself Master by Force, he plunder'd and burnt it. Upon the terrour whereof at his marching thence he had the Cities of <hi>Ortona</hi> and <hi>Luceria</hi> surrendred to him, and in the latter he took <hi>Grimoald</hi> Duke of <hi>Benevent;</hi> who not long after died of Grief. In the mean time, the Empress of <hi>Constantinople</hi> send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ambassadours into <hi>Italy,</hi> enters into a League with <hi>Charles,</hi> their several Pretensions to <hi>Italy</hi> being thus adjusted, <hi>viz.

But <hi>Nicephorus</hi> a <hi>Patrician</hi> stomaching to submit to the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Woman, having craftily seized <hi>Irene,</hi> and banished her into <hi>Lesbos,</hi> by his Ambassadours renews the League before entred into with <hi>Charles.</hi> Which <hi>Charles</hi> at this time compelled the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who had so often revolted, to remove with their Wives and Children into <hi>France,</hi> following them close in their Passage with his Army to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their committing any Disorders as they went along. Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> being perpetually disturbed by one Sedition after another, leaving <hi>Rome,</hi> goes to <hi>Mantua,</hi> to see the Bloud of Christ which was now in great esteem for the Miracles said to be wrought there by it. Having been received with great Respect and Affection by the <hi>Mantuans,</hi> and approved it to be indeed Christ's Blood upon frequent Trial of the miraculous Effects of it, he makes a Journey to <hi>Charles,</hi> who was very desirous to know the Truth of this matter, that he might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie him concerning it, and also that he might discourse with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout setling the Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi> Returning then to <hi>Rome,</hi> and being assisted by King <hi>Pipin</hi> who had his Father's Order therein, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a gentle punishment of some of the chief Plotters and movers of Sedition. <hi>Charles</hi> being now very aged; having intelligence that <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> was dead at <hi>Milain,</hi> declares <hi>Lous,</hi> his younger Son, King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitain</hi> and his Successour in the Empire, and <hi>Bernard</hi> his Nephew

The Emperour <hi>Lewis,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Godly,</hi> was now at <hi>Orleans,</hi> who assoon as he had intelligence of the Popes coming, forthwith sends all the Persons of principal Quality to meet him; and among others particularly <hi>Theudolphus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> with the Clergy, and a great part of the People. And <hi>Louis</hi> Himself going forth a whole Mile for the same purpose, assoon as he saw him alighted off his Horse, and after mutual Salutations had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed between them, introduced him very honourably into the City, the Clergy going before and after repeating the Hymn, called <hi>Te Deum Laudamus.</hi> For <hi>Stephen</hi> was not only a Person of Noble Extraction, but of such Learning and Integrity, that he easily gain'd a general Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for Sanctity, having been well instructed by an advantageous Education under those two pious Popes <hi>Adrian</hi> and <hi>Leo.</hi> Being entred into the City, supported by the Emperour because of the croud of the People who press'd out of a desire to see him, he was conducted to the Apartment appointed for him in the Palace; where he often had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences with the Emperour about the composure of the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> besides the other frequent mutual Entertainments and Civilities that pass'd between them. <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>PASCHAL,</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> Son of <hi>Bonosus,</hi> was created Pope without any Interposition of the Emperours Authority. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon at his first Investiture in that Office, he forthwith sends Nuntio's to <hi>Louis,</hi> excusing himself, and laying all the blame up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Clergy and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had forcibly compell'd him to undertake it. <hi>Louis</hi> accepting this for Satisfaction from <hi>Paschal,</hi> sends to the Clergy and People, admonishing them to observe the ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and to beware how they presum'd for time to come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the Rights of the Emperour. Also, in the Assembly held at <hi>Aken,</hi> he associated to himself in the Empire his eldest Son <hi>Lotha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and declared <hi>Pipin</hi> his second Son King of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and <hi>Louis</hi> his third Son King of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> But <hi>Bernardus</hi> King of <hi>Italy,</hi> having upon the Instigation of certain Bishops and seditious Citizens, revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Empire, and compelled some Cities and States to swear Allegiance to himself, <hi>Louis</hi> being hereat incensed, sends a strong Army into <hi>Italy;</hi> whose Passage over the <hi>Alpes Bernardus</hi> endeavouring to oppose, he was vanquished. The Heads of the Rebellion being taken were presently cut off, and <hi>Bernardus</hi> himself, though he very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively begg'd forgiveness, was put to Death at <hi>Aken,</hi> Those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops who had been Authors of the mischief were by a Decree of Synod confined into several Monasteries. This Tumult, for so it was rather than a War, being thus composed, <hi>Louis</hi> moves with his Army against the <hi>Saxons,</hi> rebelling now afresh, and overcomes and slays <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romarchus</hi> their hardy Chief, who aspired to the Kingdom. After this, he sends his Son <hi>Lotharius,</hi> whom he had declared King of <hi>Italy,</hi> to the Pope; by whom he was anointed in the Church of S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s; with the Title of <hi>Augustus.</hi> But there arising great Commotions in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Lotharius</hi> seeing himself unable to withstand them, he goes to his Father in order to provide greater Force. Upon which <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> the <hi>Primicerius,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Nomenclator,</hi> having had their Eyes first pull'd out were murdered in a Tumult in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. There was some who laid the blame of this Disorder upon <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schal</hi> himself; but he in a Synod of thirty Bishops did both by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, and by Reasons, and by his Oath purge himself of it. <hi>Louis</hi> rested himself satisfied herewith, and as <hi>Anastasius</hi> tells us, that no fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Disturbance might arise from uncertain Pretensions, writing to <hi>Paschal,</hi> he declared in his Letters what Cities of <hi>Tuscany</hi> were subject to the Empire, viz. <hi>Arezzo, Volterra, Chiusi, Florence,</hi> which had been repaired and enlarged by his Father <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great, Pistoia, Luca, Pisa, Peragia,</hi> and <hi>Orvieto;</hi> the others he allowed to be under the Jurisdiction of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He added moreover <hi>Todi</hi> in <hi>Umbria,</hi> and <hi>Romagna</hi> beyond the <hi>Appennine,</hi> with the <hi>Exarchate</hi> of <hi>Ravenna.</hi> The same <hi>Anastasius</hi> says, that <hi>Louis</hi> granted to <hi>Paschal</hi> a free Power (the same which he also tells us was given by <hi>Charles</hi> to Pope <hi>Adrian</hi>) of chusing Bishops, whereas before the Emperours were
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50681:95"/>
wont to be advised, and their consent and Confirmation desired in the Case. Our <hi>Paschal,</hi> who for his Piety and Learning had been by Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> made Prior of the Monastery of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in the Chair, both caused the Bodies of several Saints which before lay neglectedly to be conveyed into the City with great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and honourably interred; and also by paying their Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors procured the Release of divers poor Prisoners. He also built from the ground the Church of S. <hi>Praxedes</hi> the B. Martyr, not far from the old one, which through Age and the Clergy's neglect was run to Ruin. This Church having consecrated, he oftentimes celebrated Mass in it, and also reposited therein the Bodies of many Saints which lay about unregarded in the Coemeteries. In the same Church was an Oratory dedicated to S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> which he made very stately and ornamental. Moreover, he built the Church of S. <hi>Cecily</hi> (as appears still by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription on the Nave of it) in which he in like manner reposited the Bodies of that Virgin her self and her affianced Husband <hi>Valerianus,</hi> as also of <hi>Tiburtius</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> Martyrs, and <hi>Urban</hi> and <hi>Lucius,</hi> Bishops of <hi>Rome,</hi> adorning it with all kinds of Marble, and enriching it with Presents of Gold and Silver. He also repaired the Church of S. <hi>Mary ad Praesepe,</hi> that had been decayed by Age, and alter'd the Nave of it to advantage. In fine, having been very exemplary for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Piety, Good Nature and Bounty; after he had been in the Chair seven years, two months, seven days, he died, and was buried in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s. The See was then vacant only four days.</p>

But the young man being puss'd up with his great fortune wheresoever he march'd, sill'd the Countrey with slaughter, rapine, and destruction. Yet when he approach'd the City and the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> came out of respect to meet him, laying by his <hi>Gaulish</hi> sierceness he grew more mild, because contrary to his expectation he found that he might enter the City without force of Arms. The Religious also came a mile out of the City to meet him with their Crucifixes singing, <hi>Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the Highest.</hi> Thus they accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him as far as the steps of S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church, where meeting the Pope they reciprocally kissed and greeted each other and went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Silver Gates which were not opened. Then said the Pope, <hi>If thou comest hither with peaceable and friendly intentions, and if thou, hast more regard to the advantage of Christianity than to the pleasure of exercising cruelty and rapine, then with my good will thou mayest enter; if thou art otherwise minded, touch not these Gates, for over thy head hangs a Sword, which will certainly avenge any such wickedness.</hi> But when he had given the Pope assurance, immediately the doors were thrown open. Hereupon a multitude of <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Franks</hi> entring pel-mel, as soon as they came to the Altar of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> they all kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down together gave thanks to God Almighty and to the Prince of the Apostles, that matters had been carried according to their minds without hurt to any body; this was done upon the Monday after <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son-day.</hi> But soon after the Suburbs were sack'd by the Soldiers, and it wanted little but that they had got into the City for the same end, so that the eighth day aster their coming the Pope anointed <hi>Lewis</hi> with the holy Oil, crown'd him and declar'd him King of <hi>Italy.</hi> Soon after came <hi>Siconolfus</hi> Prince of <hi>Beneventum</hi> to congratulate him, and then the multitude was such that the Trees were lopt, the Beasts driven away and even the standing-Corn cut down, that their Horses might not want Provender. The Pope therefore easily agreed to all their requests, if they were reasonable, that he might the sooner rid the City of them: and the <hi>Romans</hi> being now delivered from the fear of their tyrannical Barbarity celebrated their Pope as the true Vicar of Christ and the only Father of his Countrey. He betaking himself to the beautifying of Churches, reslor'd that of SS. <hi>Sylvester</hi> and <hi>Martin</hi> which time had ruin'd, and in it together with those of the two Confessors, he plac'd the Bodies of <hi>Fabianus, Stephanus, Sotherius, Asterius, Cyriacus, Maurus, Smaragdus, Anastasius, Innocentius, Quirinus, Leo, Arthemius, Theodorus</hi> and <hi>Nicander.</hi> He built also near that Church from the foundation a Monaslery dedicated to SS. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> where Mass was incessantly sung. But at last this holy Pope having manag'd the assairs of the Church with great integrity and success, in the third year of his Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicate, died and was buried in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church.

                  <hi>LEO</hi> the fourth, a <hi>Roman,</hi> son of <hi>Radulphus,</hi> was in the year 848. by a general consent elected Pope, and very deservedly; for he was one that whilst he liv'd a private life, was very eminent for Religion, Innocence, Piety, Good Nature, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality and especially for Ecclesiastical Learning. He was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of so much Prudence and Courage that as the Gospel directs, he could, when it was necessary imitate either the Wisdom of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or the Innocence of the Dove. So general was the good Report of him that Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> II. was persuaded to create this pattern of Virtue a Priest from a Sub-deacon and to give him the Title and Church <hi>Sanctorum quatuor Coronatorum,</hi> from whence upon the death of <hi>Sergius</hi> he was brought to the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church and plac'd in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Chair, being universaily saluted as Pope, all that were present, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ancient Custom kissing his feet. There are some of opinion, that by the prayers of this good man it was, that God was mov'd to repress the rage of the <hi>Saracens</hi> by drowning their Fleet as they were returning home laden with Spoil. For they having overcome <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> Admiral to the Emperor <hi>Michael</hi> in a Sea-fight near <hi>Tarentum,</hi> they ravag'd far and near through <hi>Italy</hi> without opposition, and having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and sack'd <hi>Ancona</hi> and harass'd the Coast of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> when they were returning triumphantly to their own Countrey, it pleased God they were cast away at Sea by storm. So that <hi>Leo</hi> being free from his fear of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> betook himself to publick works, and caused Benches of Marble to be plac'd in the entrance to the <hi>Lateran</hi> Cloister and finish'd the Gallery which <hi>Leo</hi> III. had begun. This good Prelate ordain'd that yearly in the Church of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> on the Birth-day of that Apostle Vesper's should be said by all the Clergy. He prohibited all Lay-men entrance into the Chancel during Divine Service. About this time at his command solemn Supplications were made to avert Gods anger, which the frequent Earthquakes seem'd to threaten. He adorn'd after an extraordinary manner the Cross which <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor had given to the <hi>Basilica Constantiniana,</hi> which had been pilfer'd of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones that belong'd to it. 'Tis sure he was a man of so great sanctity, that by his Prayers he drove away out of an Arch in S. <hi>Lucie'</hi>s Church, a Basilise (call'd by the Latins <hi>Regulus</hi>) which with its breath and poison had kill'd many; and by the sign of the Cross he stop'd a great fire, which had burn'd down the quarter where the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xons</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> liv'd, and reach'd very near S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church. This happened the eighth day after the Assumption of our Lady, which day was afterward kept as a Festival without the walls not far from S. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence'</hi>s Church, where stood a Church dedicated to the B. Virgin, to which this munificent Pope had made many donaries of Gold and Silver. Beside this he finished the Mosaic work in the Churches of SS. <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Silvester in montibus,</hi> and the Pargetting which <hi>Scrgius</hi> had begun, as the Inscription shews which is all that is lest; the painting being long

But suffering afterward one of her Domesticks to lie with her, she hid her big-bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a while, till as she was going to the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church between the <hi>Colossean</hi> Theatre (so call'd from <hi>Nero'</hi>s Coloss) and S. <hi>Clement'</hi>s, her travail came upon her and she died upon the place, having sat two years, one month and four days, and was buried there without any pomp. Some say, the Pope for shame of the thing does purposely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline going through that street when he goes to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and that to avoid the like Error, when any Pope is first plac'd in the Porphyry Chair, which has a hole made for the purpose, his Genitals are hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the youngest Deacon. As for the first I deny it not; but for the second, I take the reason of it to be, that he who is plac'd in so great authority may be minded that he is not a God but a man, and obnoxious to necessities of Nature, as of easing his body, whence that Seat hath the name of <hi>Sedes stercoraria.</hi> This story is vulgarly told, but by very uncertain and obscure Authors, and therefore I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it barely and in short, lest I should seem obstinate and pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious if I had omitted what is so generally talk'd; I had better mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake with the rest of the World; though it be certain, that what I have related may be thought not altogether incredible.

                  <hi>BENEDICT</hi> the third, by birth a <hi>Roman,</hi> Son of <hi>Peter;</hi> he was deservedly called <hi>Benedictus</hi> for the Sanctity of his Life and his knowledg in Divinity. For while he lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Gregory,</hi> he was made by him Sub-Deacon, and thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward led so exemplary a life, that upon the death of <hi>Leo,</hi> he onely was thought worthy to succeed so great a Pope. To him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they address themselves, as to a kind Angel by God sent down to them, and presently declare him Pope. He weeping and calling God and his holy Saints to witness profess'd himself utterly unworthy of so high a dignity. But the Election being universally lik'd and applauded, he at last unwillingly accepted of the Office, was brought to the <hi>Lateran</hi> and plac'd in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Chair, whence he was led upon a white Horse to the Church of S. <hi>Mary maggiore,</hi> where he spent three days in Fasting and Prayer, begging God to grant that he might govern his Church with integrity and holiness. The third day past, the People came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again, and according to custom, kissed his feet, especially those of the faction of <hi>Rhodoardus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Porto,</hi> who the day before had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to set up instead of <hi>Benedict</hi> one <hi>Anastasius</hi> an obscure man, who had been turned out of his Bishoprick by <hi>Leo;</hi> but now finding their error, they asked pardon, and becoming of the right opinion, they also made the usual adoration to this holy man. As likewise did the Embassadours sent to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Emperor <hi>Lewis</hi> to confirm the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Clergy and Laity. The next day he was attended by the People to S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church, where being according to custom and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient tradition, publickly consecrated, he received the <hi>insignia</hi> of his Office with unanimous shouts and acclamations. For he was a man of so sweet a temper and so great modesty both in his mind and aspect, that as well in his publick managements as in his private station he gain'd the love and respect of all men. And now setting his mind on the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God he repair'd many Churches almost tottering with age, and increased their Treasures. He ordain'd that the Pope and Clergy should accompany the funerals of Bishops, Priests and Deacons, as well to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Corps as to pray for their Souls; and that the Clergy should in like manner attend the Funerals of Popes; and what he had thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd himself observ'd punctually as long as he liv'd, for he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways present at the burials of the Priests. He was a frequent visiter of the sick, a nursing Father to the poor, a comforter of the miserable and hopeless, a zealous patron of the Widow and Fatherless. And in thus doing having spent a most holy life, late enough for himself, but too soon for the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> he died, having sate two years six months and nine days, and was buried before S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church-doors. The Sea then was vacant fifteen days.</p>

After a long consultation in the Church of S. <hi>Denys</hi> Pope and Confessor (where they convened for this purpose) they chose this <hi>Nicolas</hi> Pope; but he was absent and upon hearing the news fled into the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and there hid himself to avoid the Dignity, where at length they found him, brought him to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and plac'd him however unwilling in the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Chair.

S. <hi>Laurence'</hi>s Church and the Monastery of S. <hi>Sylvester,</hi> with all the low part between <hi>Via lata, Campidoglio</hi> and the <hi>Aventine</hi> was so much under water, that another deluge was feared; many houses were born down by it, Trees forc'd up by the roots and Corn that was sown was quite wash'd away; and the same happened again the same year in <hi>December.</hi> To make up these losses or to make them more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, the Pope omitted no manner of good Office or kindness to the Citizens. At this time <hi>Michael</hi> Son of <hi>Theophilus</hi> Emperor of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> sent Embassadors with Presents to <hi>Rome,</hi> to visit the Apostolick Sea and his Holiness.

                  <hi>HADRIAN</hi> the second, a <hi>Roman,</hi> Son of <hi>Talarus</hi> a Bishop, was a familiar friend of Pope <hi>Sergius,</hi> who having once given him forty <hi>Julio'</hi>s, when he came home he gave them to his Steward to give to the Beggers and poor strangers that were at his door; which the Steward going to do, saw the number was so great, that 'twould not serve a quarter of them, and so he return'd and told <hi>Hadrian:</hi> Who hereupon takes the money and coming to the poor folks gave every one three <hi>Julio'</hi>s and reserv'd to himself as many for his own use; at which Miracle the Steward being astonish'd, <q>Dost thou see (says <hi>Hadrian</hi>) how good and bountiful the Lord is to those that are liberal and charitable to the Poor?</q> By this and other Virtues he grew into so high estimation with all men, that when the Consultation was held for making a new Pope, they unanimously elected him, and brought him against his will from the Church of S. <hi>Mary ad Proesepe</hi> to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and immediately created him Pope, nor regarding the consent of any person in a proceeding so tumultuary: which gave great offence to the Embassadors of the Emperor who came on purpose upon this occasion, but could not (as they ought) interpose the Imperial Authority in this Election. But satisfaction was made to them by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating that it was impossible in so great a tumult to moderate the violent inclinations of the multitude; they were desired therefore to concur with the Clergy and People and according to custom to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late as Pope this excellent man whom they had chosen; This at last the Embassadors did, though they saw plainly, that the Clergy and People did arrogate to themselves the full power of creating a Pope, without expecting the consent of any Temporal Prince; and this perhaps in order to enlarge the Liberties of holy Church by making it a Custom. Soon after arriv'd Letters from <hi>Lewis</hi> highly applauding this action of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and commending them that they had proceeded so reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously and sincerely in this Affair; without waiting for the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any one, whose ignorance of the fitness of the Canditates might render them incompetent Judges in the case. <q>For how (said he) can it be, that one that is a Foreiner and a Stranger should be able in another Countrey to distinguish who is most worthy?

They were <hi>Sylvester</hi> the Sub-deacon, <hi>Leopardus</hi> of <hi>Ancona,</hi> and <hi>Dominic</hi> of <hi>Trevisa,</hi> who soon composed the whole Affair to the Popes mind; though 'twas not long ere the <hi>Bulgarians</hi> corrupted with gifts and promises by the <hi>Constantinopolitans,</hi> expel'd the <hi>Latin</hi> Priests and receiv'd the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and this Sedition gave occasion to many quarrels betwixt the Greeks and Latins. <hi>Hadrian</hi> still opposing himself to all the Enemies of the Church as much as was possible, when he was about to anoint <hi>Charles</hi> Emperor in the room of <hi>Lewis</hi> now deceased, died himself in the fifth year, ninth month and twelfth day of his Popedom.

Upon this news Pope <hi>John</hi> used his utmost endeavour, that <hi>Charles</hi> his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> (surnamed the <hi>Stamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi>) King of <hi>France</hi> might be made Emperor; but the great men of <hi>Rome</hi> opposed it, desiring rather that <hi>Charles</hi> III. King of <hi>Germany</hi> might succeed, who with his Brother <hi>Caroloman</hi> had now over-run a great part of <hi>Italy.</hi> So great was the Sedition, that though many favour'd <hi>Lewis,</hi> yet they took the Pope and clap'd him in prison. But by the help of some Friends he soon made his escape into <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Lewis,</hi> where he slaid a year, anointed him King, and ended some Controversies depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the Ecclesiastics. For <hi>Gibertus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nismes</hi> had by force turn'd <hi>Leo</hi> an Abbot out of his Monastery.

several Decrees about religious affairs, and appointed a Bishop for the <hi>Flemings,</hi> who having left their Woods and fastnesses now betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to an orderly way of living.

               <p>
                  <hi>FORMOSUS</hi> Bishop of <hi>Porto</hi> succeeded <hi>Stephen,</hi> and in the beginning of his Pontificate adorned S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church with some slight Paintings. This <hi>Formosus</hi> had formerly for fear of Pope <hi>John,</hi> left his Bishoprick and fled to <hi>France;</hi> and denying to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn when he was recall'd, he was anathematized, and then coming to <hi>Rome</hi> he was depriv'd of all his Preferments Ecclesiastical, and put on profane manners with his secular habit. Some think the reason that <hi>Formosus</hi> was thus persecuted was for that he was a Party, if not Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader of the Faction that put <hi>John</hi> into Prison. However <hi>Formosus</hi> was so enraged at this hard usage, that he swore he would never return either to <hi>Rome</hi> or to his Bishoprick; but Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> who succeeded <hi>John,</hi> absolv'd him from his Oath, and restor'd him to his Countrey and to his former Dignity, whence not long after he came to the Popedom, rather by bribery than for the sake of any good that was in him, many men op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing his Election. <hi>Arnulphus</hi> now, the seventh Emperor from <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, as we said before, marching valiantly against the still rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious <hi>Normans</hi> gave them several Overthrows, but was too much puffed up with his success and became so intolerably imperious to all men, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Clergy, that it pleased God, he died soon after of the lousie Disease. In whose room <hi>Lewis</hi> was put up for Emperor, but we read not that he was ever Crowned, for (as <hi>Martinus</hi> writes) <hi>Berengarius</hi> Duke of <hi>Friuli</hi> descended of the old Kings of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> renewing his claim to the Kingdom of his Ancestors, and bringing his pretensions to the decision of War, though at first he was overcome by <hi>Lewis,</hi> yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him Battel again at <hi>Verona, Lewis</hi> was vanquished and with great slaughter of his men being taken Prisoner had his eyes put out. And thus the Empire which the <hi>Franks</hi> had enjoy'd almost 100 years, was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the <hi>Lombards, Constantine</hi> the Son of <hi>Leo</hi> being Emperor of the

East. I know not how it fell out, that at this same time that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors shewed so little Courage, the Popes too were as greatly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Virtue and Integrity, which render'd those times very miserable, Subjects being very apt (as <hi>Plato</hi> says) to follow the Examples of their Princes. I return to <hi>Formosus,</hi> whose times (left they should have been the most unhappy that ever were) were honour'd with the Learning and good Life of <hi>Remigius</hi> of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> who wrote divers Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, especially upon the Gospel of <hi>S.

Some say indeed, that Author was not the person of whom I speak, but <hi>Remigius</hi> of <hi>Rhemes;</hi> however that be, 'tis certain they were both very learned men. <hi>Formosus</hi> died in the fifth year and sixth month of his Pontificate, and the Sea was vacant two days.</p>

These Popes by their constant inobservance of all Apostolical Practices were the occasions (in my Opinion) of these turmoils, especially joyning with that the Cowardize and Negligence of the Princes of Christendom; whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest it was that the Ship of <hi>S.

At this time (as I said before) <hi>Lewis</hi> the Son of <hi>Arnulphus</hi> endeavouring to recover his Fathers Empire was taken and kill'd at <hi>Verona</hi> by <hi>Berengarius;</hi> and then the posterity of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great first lost their Titles to <hi>France</hi> and the Empire of <hi>Germany.</hi> So true it is that which <hi>Salust</hi> says, Every rising hath its setting and every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease its wane. The Empire which had arrived to so great a height lost its splendor by the sluggishness of the great men and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they once grew remiss in the exercises of Virtue, and emasculated their bodies with Luxury and with studied softnesses. And this we may say, was the case of the Papacy, for at first the Pontifical Dignity (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wealth and among Enemies and furious Persecutors of Christianity) was illustrious with a holiness and learning not to be attain'd without great pains and a consummate Virtue; but now the Church of God was grown wanton with its Riches, and the Clergy quitted severity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for lasciviousness; so that there being no Prince to punish their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, such a Licentiousness of sinning obtain'd in the World as brought forth these Monsters, these Prodigies of wickedness by whom the Chair of <hi>S.

Yet this may be said for <hi>Benedict,</hi> that in this debauch'd Age he carried himself with gravity and constancy, and died in the third year and fourth month of his Pontificate, after which the Sea was vacant six days.</p>

them occasion to believe, that <hi>Formosus</hi> was not justly prosecuted with so great ignominy.

And now, Reader, pray observe how very much these Popes had degenerated from their Predecessors: they, good men, refused this dignity when it was freely offered them, chusing rather to spend their time in Study and in Prayer: these on the contrary, sought the Papacy with ambition and bribery; and when they were got in, slighting the Worship of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Some there are that ascribe these Actions I have mention'd, to the time of this Pope; but I would rather assign them to some of those Popes that preceded and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; because, though I have set them down in short, yet they must needs require a long time to be brought about. But in so great a diversity of opinions concerning times, I chose rather to place them somewhere than utterly to omit things which were certainly once done, for the uncertainty of Writers. For the sake of Posterity we would not be so superstitious as to disbelieve that which various Authors have here or there thought good to record.

But see the turn of humane affairs; The Popes of our times make nothing to clap up Citizens into the same place and there starve 'em, whether they deserve it or are onely a little too powerful than they desire. I believe <hi>Otho</hi> was too much taken up with other business, so that he could not help him. He died when he had been Pope one year and six months.</p>

Observe, I beseech you, how these Popes did degenerate from their Predecessors, who left the Church so ample and magnificent at the expence of their blood. The Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> the Father and Protector of things sacred, does himself steal 'em away, and he that should punish sacriledg is the Author of it; but thus it must needs fall out in any Government where the Pride and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness of ill Men shall prevail over the Virtue and Wisdom of the good.

At length the Emperor arriv'd and investing the City, when the <hi>Romans</hi> perceived themselves unable to withstand so great Forces, trusting to the clemency of <hi>Otho,</hi> they opened their Gates to the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> And now <hi>Crescentius</hi> and <hi>John</hi> being without Friends and at their wits end, fled into Castle S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and defended themselves well; till upon hopes of Pardon coming forth to address themselves to the Emperor, <hi>Crescentius</hi> receiving many wounds from the Multitude, was kill'd; but <hi>John</hi> having his Eyes first put out, lost both his Popedom and life together; and <hi>Gregory</hi> after he had been expell'd nine months, was restored. He taking notice of the weakness of the Empire and the uncertainties of Chance, and being willing to preserve the Empire among the <hi>Germans,</hi> and that he should be preferred before other who excell'd in worth and Virtue, with the consent of <hi>Otho,</hi> he made a Decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Election of an Emperor, <hi>An.

was added, they say, to prevent discord between parties, for if the rest were equally divided, his Vote turned the Scale. This, 'tis said, gave distaste to the <hi>French;</hi> but because the Line of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great being extinct in <hi>Lewis</hi> the Son of <hi>Lotharius,</hi> that Realm was fallen into the hands of <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> the chief Minister at that time (the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that Kingdom for some time not being manag'd by Kings) they wav'd all thoughts of retrieving the Empire; but the main reason was that the new Possessors were well enough yet satisfied with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and dar'd not attempt any thing further, 'till they were certain that their late acquir'd Regal Power stood upon a good foundation. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> the Son and Successor of the Great <hi>Hugh</hi> is much and deservedly praised for his Courage, Justice, Modesty and Religion; for though he exercised himself very much in the Art Military, yet he found time so often to frequent the Churches of God and to celebrate the Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as if he had been in holy Orders.

Being greedy of Rule, he ask'd the Devil once, how long he should enjoy the Pontificate, the Enemy of mankind answer'd (as he is wont) ambiguously, that he should live long, if he came not near <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> So that when in the fourth year, first month and tenth day of his Papacy he was at <hi>Rome</hi> at Mass in the Church of <hi>Holy Cross in Jerusalem,</hi> it came into his mind that now he must die; where he heartily repenting confess'd his fault before the people, exhorting them all to lay aside Ambition and to withstand the Stratagems of the Devil, betaking themselves to a holy and pious life: then he desired them, that after his death they would lay the trunk of his Body however torn and dismembred, as it deserved to be, in a Cart, and there to bury it where the Horses should of their own accord carry it: and then (as 'tis said) that wicked Men might see that yet there was some room for pardon left with God for them, if they at any time repent, by the Divinc Will and Providence, the Horses of their own accord went to the Church of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> where his body was buried. <hi>Martinus</hi> writes beside, that as well from the clattering of this Pope's bones, as from the Sweat or rather moisture of his Tomb, People are wont to gather Presages and those most manifest of the approaching death of any Pope, and that this is hinted in the Epitaph on his Tomb.

Who afterward dying at <hi>Pistoia,</hi> the <hi>Tuscans</hi> universally bewailed him as a publick Parent, not suffering any manner of Respect to be wanting to his Funeral. In this place I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thought good to mention the deserv'd praises of <hi>Hugo,</hi> that Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Countries may know, that it is much better by a just and generous administration to acquire glory and honour, than by unjust ways to heap up Riches with everlasting shame and ignominy.</p>

What else indeed is an illiterate Prince, but the Image of a Lion command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other beasts? 'Tis necessary they should be able to moderate their own passions as well as the peoples, who would be thought fit to govern others. With great reason therefore it is that we speak well of <hi>Robert,</hi> whose devotion was such, that as ost as he had leisure from his warlike Employments, he would sing the canonical hours with the Priests; and so great were his merits in this way, that once when he had beleaguer'd a Town of his Enemies, and neglected the Siege to attend the canonical hours, the Walls miraculously sell down and his Men immediately rushing in, took the place. But <hi>John</hi> (according to some Authors) having sate in the Chair four years and four months died and was buried in <hi>S. Peter'</hi>s Church. The Sea was then vacant nineteen days.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>SERGIUS</hi> the Fourth, a <hi>Roman,</hi> Son of <hi>Martin,</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; a Man of a most holy life and sweet conversation both before and in his Pontificate. He was charitable to the poor, chearful among his Friends and Acquaintants, merciful to those who were faulty, and mild even with the perverse. Beside he was so prudent, that in all the time he sate in the Chair, nothing was committed which could reflect any charge of negligence upon his Government. For placing all his thoughts in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (which all Popes ought to do) and having a mind imbued with much natural goodness he brought about all things to his mind. By his counsel and advice the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> entred into a League for dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Saracens</hi> out of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and accordingly made equal prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men. There were then in <hi>Italy</hi> most of the Sons of <hi>Tancred</hi> the great Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> among whom was <hi>William</hi> surnam'd <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebach,</hi> a Man of so great courage, that taking for his Companion in the Expedition, <hi>Malochus</hi> General of the Forces of <hi>Michael Catalaicus</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> he in a short time clear'd that Island of <hi>Saracens,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Capoua</hi> and <hi>Salerno</hi> lending some assistance. Afterward <hi>Malochus</hi> using injustice in the division of the Spoil, <hi>William</hi> thought good to dissemble for the time, but returning into <hi>Italy</hi> with forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Normans</hi> who were just come from the Holy War, he seizes upon all <hi>Apulia</hi> which was subject to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and at <hi>Melfi</hi> meets <hi>Malo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> with his Army, fights and defeats him: and thus by the valour of <hi>William</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Apulia</hi> was transferred from the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the <hi>Normans;</hi> for he dying without Heirs his Brother <hi>Drogo</hi> succeeded him, and to him succeeded <hi>Humfrey</hi> a younger Brother, from whom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended <hi>Robert Guiscardi</hi> and his Brother <hi>Roger.</hi> While this past in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulia, Italy</hi> and almost all the World too labouring under a Famine and Pestilence, the holy Man <hi>Sergius</hi> died in the second year and fifteenth day of his Popedom, and was buried in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church.

Some say, that <hi>Otho</hi> died at <hi>Rome</hi> and that his body was carried into <hi>Germany;</hi> others say 'twas buried in <hi>S. Peter'</hi>s Church. However that may be, 'tis certain, that <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and a most holy person was now created Emperor, and that he had an Empress equally praise-worthy for Charity, Devotion and Affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50681:116"/>
But whilst he was employed in composing the affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Saracens</hi> entred <hi>Italy,</hi> took <hi>Capua,</hi> and besieg'd <hi>Bari,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof being reduced to extremity for want of Provisions, the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> with their Fleet reliev'd them, and with the assistance of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> set upon the <hi>Saracens</hi> who sate before it, and with great slaughter of them, raised the Siege, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1008. at the same time that <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was taken by the <hi>Turks,</hi> without any violation of the Holy Sepulchre, the Church of Mount <hi>Sion</hi> or <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> had a design to have reliev'd <hi>Jerusalem</hi> too, but that they were with held by their Enemies of <hi>Zara,</hi> to whom yet at <hi>Loreto</hi> they gave so total a rout, that they durst never after by War molest any of their Neighbours. But <hi>Henry</hi> having setled the state of <hi>Germany,</hi> coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> received the Imperial Crown, and then marching to <hi>Capua,</hi> drove the <hi>Saracens</hi> out of it, and carried on the War against <hi>Bubagano</hi> a General of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who favour'd the <hi>Moors,</hi> with so much vigour, that he dispossess'd him of <hi>Troy,</hi> a City he had built in the confines of <hi>Apulia,</hi> in a place where <hi>Hannibal</hi> was said heretofore to have encamp'd. The Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> and his Wife <hi>Cunigunda</hi> are reported to have led such chast and holy lives, that they grew famous for working Miracles, omitting no action which might contribute to the glory of God. He founded the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Bamberg,</hi> and married his Daughter to the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> by whose means that King and all his Subjects received the Christian Faith; but <hi>Henry</hi> died in the eighth year of his Empire, to the great loss of his Subjects. He being dead, of whom in all exigencies <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> made use as his Protector, he was expell'd by a Faction and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pope chosen in his room, though he soon after agreed the matter with his Adversaries, who turn'd out again the Pseudo-Pope, and restor'd <hi>Benedict</hi> with honour. He died in the eleventh year, first month and thirteenth day of his Popedom and was buried in S. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Church. 'Tis said, that a certain Bishop walking in a solitary place, <hi>Benedict</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to him sitting upon a black Horse, whereupon the Bishop ask'd him the reason of his appearance in that manner; he answer'd, that his business was to desire him to take some Money which he had hid in a certain place to which he directed him, and to give it to the poor, as from him; for that the Money had been of no profit to him, it consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what had been given of Alms or gotten by Rapine. The Bishop executed his request, and immediately surrendred his Bishoprick and led a Monastic life. <hi>Vincentius</hi> writes, that <hi>Gerard</hi> Bishop of <hi>Canobio</hi> was in great account about this time for his Learning and exemplary Life; as also was <hi>Gutherus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Prague,</hi> who for his great abilities and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness suffered Martyrdom from the Enemies of the Christian Religion. At this time also so great a Pestilence raged in the World, that 'twas thought fewer surviv'd it than died of it: which Calamity was fore-shew'd by a Well of wholesom Water in <hi>Lorain</hi> being turn'd into blood.</p>

In this <hi>Interregnum</hi> I suppose it was, that several Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> revolted from the Empire and stood up for their liberty; wherefore <hi>Conrade,</hi> who was a great Soldier and had been for many years in great Command in the Wars under <hi>Henry,</hi> raising an Army speedily enters <hi>Italy,</hi> and marching first against the <hi>Milaneses,</hi> the chief Authors of this defection, he sits down before the Town, burns the Suburbs and breaths forth nothing but utter ruin to the City; but quickly raises his Siege, by the persuasion of the Arch-bishop of <hi>Cologn,</hi> who assured him, that as he was at Mass, S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> appear'd to him, and threaten'd destruction to them all, except they departed from the City of which himself was Patron. <hi>Conrade</hi> therefore holds on his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> where at the hands of Pope <hi>John</hi> he receiv'd the Imperial Crown, and then march'd against the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> who had assisted the rebellious <hi>Italians</hi> and soon subdu'd them. <hi>Rodolphus</hi> also Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> being vex'd by the Seditions of his Subjects, put himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of <hi>Conrade,</hi> and therefore <hi>Burgundy</hi> has been ever since <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It is said of <hi>Conrade,</hi> that he made several very useful Laws; among which one was, that it should be death for any Prince of the Empire to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the peace of it; and upon that account he was a fierce Persecutor of <hi>Leopold</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Count, who was a Ring-leader of some distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances in his Country.

In his time Religion was adorn'd in <hi>France</hi> by the strict life and holiness of several Abbats, and <hi>Himericus</hi> Son of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> had great reputation for his Miracles.

The <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy then by the persuasion of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> elected <hi>Baunon</hi> Pope, and so much the more readily, because he had prosess'd the right of electing Popes ought not to be in the Emperor, but in the Clergy. And yet the Vices of several Popes were (as we have said) so great, that it seem'd to be done by the judgment of God, that this Power should be taken from the Clergy, that they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their flagitious lives and sinful inclinations, and that the Church of Christ might not suffer ruin in the hands of such evil Prelates. Thus <hi>Baunon</hi> having got the Papacy, and having chang'd his name to <hi>Leo</hi> IX. he immediately created <hi>Hildebrand</hi> a Cardinal-Deacon and gave him the Government of S. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Church; so that it seem'd as if they had divided the Pontifical charge between them, one ruling the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the other that of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Drogo</hi> Chieftain of the <hi>Normans</hi> in <hi>Apulia</hi> dying, his Brother <hi>Gisulphus</hi> succeeded him and possess'd himself by force of the City of <hi>Benevent</hi> which was the Popes by surrender; for when the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> having built a Church at <hi>Bamberg</hi> to the honour of S. <hi>George,</hi> and had a great mind it should be made a Cathedral, <hi>Benedict</hi> VIII. consented upon condition the said Church should pay yearly, as a kind of Tribute, a hundred Marks of Silver, and a white Horse with his caparisons; which year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly payment <hi>Leo</hi> IX. remitted to the Church of <hi>Bamberg,</hi> receiving of the Emperor in lieu thereof the City of <hi>Benevent. Leo</hi> therefore streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with the justice of his Title and the Emperor's Forces, marches against <hi>Gisulphus</hi> with an undisciplin'd Army, and is by him defeated and taken Prisoner; but was soon remitted to <hi>Rome</hi> with an honourable retinue.

In matters relating to the Faith he used great diligence and industry, for in a Council holden at <hi>Vercelli</hi> he condemned <hi>Berengarius</hi> for a Heretick, and by his Monitories put the Emperor of <hi>Constantinople</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on repairing the holy Sepulchre at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which had been spoil'd by the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> At this same time lived <hi>Theobald</hi> a noble <hi>French</hi>-man famous for his holy life at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Liege,</hi> a person remarkable for Learning and Piety, wrote many things skilfully and acutely concerning the Quadrature of the Circle to <hi>Hermannus,</hi> a Man of an excellent Wit. <hi>Leo</hi> died when he had been Pope five years two months and six days.</p>

And that he might not seem to have done it in an heat, he called a Council in the <hi>Lateran</hi> (at which many Bishops were present, particularly <hi>Gilbert,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Parma,</hi> born at <hi>Ravenna</hi>) where he gave a reason why he laid such Censures upon Simoniacks, and said, He would do the same to the Emperour unless he alter'd his mind. <hi>Gilbert,</hi> when the Council was dismiss'd, having gotten a fair occasion to accuse <hi>Gregory,</hi> and withal being ambitious of the Popedom, incensed <hi>Cincius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen (Son to <hi>Stephen,</hi> who was Governour of the City) no less rash than seditious against the Pope; and promised him great things in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's name, if he would do as he would have him.

Nevertheless some of those that were present continu'd to urge him, and persuade him that a King ought not to have been anathematiz'd so hastily. To whom the Pope reply'd; When, said he, Christ committed his Church to <hi>Peter</hi> and said, <hi>Feed my sheep,</hi> did he except Kings?

Wherefore he that says, He cannot be bound by the Churches power, must needs confess, he cannot any more be absolved by it: now whosoever is so impudent as to affirm this, makes himself a perfect Separatist from Christ and his Church. When <hi>Henry</hi> heard what <hi>Gregory</hi> had done, he wrote many Letters to several Nations, complaining that he was condemn'd by the Pope against all Law and Reason. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Thereupon the Pope, who was induced by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and prayers of the Arch-bishop of <hi>Treves, Henry'</hi>s Embassadour, was going on his journey toward <hi>Augst,</hi> but when he came to <hi>Vercelli,</hi> was privately inform'd by the Bishop of that place, who is Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of all <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Henry</hi> was coming against him with an Army. At which the Pope forbare to go any further, but went to <hi>Canosso,</hi> a Town near <hi>Rheggio,</hi> under the Countess <hi>Matilda. Henry</hi> also made thither as fast as he could with his whole Army, and laying aside his regal Habit, he went barefoot to the gate of the Town (to move the Townsmens pity) and desired to be let in. But he was deny'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and took it very patiently, or at least seemed so to do, though it were a sharp Winter, and all things bound up in frost. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he tarried in the Suburbs three days, and begg'd pardon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, till at last by the intercession of <hi>Maude,</hi> and <hi>Adelaus</hi> an Earl of <hi>Savoy,</hi> together with the Abbat of <hi>Clugny</hi> he was introduced, absolved and reconciled to the Church; having sworn to a Peace, and promised future obedience. The form of the Kings Oath was this: <q>I King <hi>Henry</hi> do affirm that I will keep all the conditions and engagements that are in the Peace, which our Lord, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, has drawn up according to his mind: and will take care, that the said Pope shall go where he pleases without the least molestation either to Him or his Attendants, especially through all our Dominions, and that I will be no hinderance to him in the exercise of his Pontifical authority in any place whatsoever; and this I swear I will observe.</q> Done at <hi>Canosso January</hi> the 28. Indiction the 15th. But when he had succeeded according to his wish, and all people were gone to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral homes, <hi>Henry</hi> moved toward <hi>Pavia,</hi> but lost <hi>Cincius</hi> by the way, who dy'd of a Fever: and yet <hi>Henry</hi> (though that Villain was gone) did not desist from innovation. For he broke the Peace, and thereby vexed the <hi>German</hi> Princes to such a degree, that they declared <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> King, and rejected <hi>Henry.</hi> That moved <hi>Henry</hi> to petition the Pope, that he would disposses <hi>Rodolphus</hi> of the Kingdom by Excommunication. But seeing he could not obtain so great a favour, he betook himself to his Arms, and engaged him in a bloody Battel, where the Victory was uncertain on both sides. And then they each sent Embassadours to the Pope, to beg of him, that he would assist 'em: to which he made no other answer, but that he would have 'em quit
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50681:124"/>
their Arms. But notwithstanding <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Rodolphus</hi> fought a second time without any odds: and therefore when they had engaged the third time, and kill'd a great many men on both sides, <hi>Henry</hi> (who seemed to have a little the better of it) would not hear <hi>Rodolphus'</hi>s Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours that came to him for Peace, but wrote to the Pope again, that he would please to Anathematize <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> who endeavour'd to get possession of his Kingdom. Which <hi>Gregory</hi> refusing to do, <hi>Henry</hi> was so angry, that he studied day and night to ruin the Pope. In the mean while, lest Sedition should be wanting in Christendom, <hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Andronicus</hi> his Son, who had been by force depriv'd of the Empire of <hi>Constantinople</hi> by <hi>Nicephorus Bucamor,</hi> came for refuge to <hi>Gregory;</hi> who not only excommunicated <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> but employ'd <hi>Rogerius</hi> a feudatary of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to restore <hi>Michael,</hi> with whom he discours'd at <hi>Cepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano,</hi> to the Empire.

But <hi>Dominick Sylvius,</hi> Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> who was of <hi>Nicephorus'</hi>s party, beat <hi>Rogerius</hi> from the Siege, with great loss on both sides.

But in the mean while <hi>Gregory,</hi> lest the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should suffer by Simony, called a Council, and therein confirm'd the Decrees of his Predecessors made to put a stop to that evil, in these words: <q>We, following the example of our Predecessors, as we have formerly in other Councils, do decree and ordain by the authority of Almighty God, that whoever for the future accepts of a Bishoprick, an Abbacy, or any other Ecclesiastical preferment from a Layman, shall not by any means be esteemed a Bishop, an Abbat, or a Clergy man; nor let the same person dare to approach the Apostolical Sea, before he has repented and left the place that he gain'd by ambition and contumacy, which is the sin of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And under the same Censures we bind Kings, Dukes, and Princes, who shall dare to confer Bishopricks or other Ecclesiastical Dignities upon any person against Law and Reason. Furthermore, we confirm the sentence of <hi>Anathema</hi> which was justly given against <hi>Theobald</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Gilbert</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> as also against <hi>Roland</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Treviso;</hi> and we lay the same Censure upon <hi>Peter,</hi> who was formerly Bishop of <hi>Redona,</hi> but is now an Usurper in the Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For I did not ascend this Sea willingly, but against my inclinations, even with tears in my eyes, that they should think such a worthless Man as me fit to sit in such a lofty Throne. But this I say, because
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:50681:125"/>
I did not chuse you, but you me, and imposed this heavy burden up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my shoulders. But the Sons of Belial are risen up against me since I have ascended the Mount, because I cry aloud and tell the people of their crimes, and the Sons of the Church of their sins, and have laid violent hands upon me even unto blood. For the Kings of the Earth stood up, and the Princes of the World, with some Ecclesiasticks and others have conspired against the Lord, and me his Anointed; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Let us break their bonds asunder, and cast their yoke from us, and this they did, that they might either kill or banish me. Of these one was King <hi>Henry,</hi> as they call him: <hi>Henry,</hi> I say, Son to <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour, who exalted his horns, and lifted up his heel too proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Church of God, in a conspiracy with many Bishops of <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> whose ambition your authority has yet opposed. This same person came to me in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> when he was rather forced by necessity than sober in his resolutions, and begg'd to be absolv'd from his <hi>Anathema:</hi> and accordingly I receiv'd him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I thought him a Penitent; but only admitted him to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, not restored him to his Kingdom from which I had justly expelled him in the Council at <hi>Rome;</hi> nor did I give the Subjects of the Kingdom leave to pay him their former Allegiance. And this I did, that if he delay'd his reconcilement with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations whom he had always vexed, and should refuse to restore as well Ecclesiastical as Secular Estates, according to his word, he might be forc'd to his duty by <hi>Anathema'</hi>s and Arms. Some Bishops of <hi>Germany</hi> made use of this opportunity, as also certain Princes who had been long tormented by this wild beast, thought fit to chuse <hi>Rodolphus</hi> for their King and Governour, since <hi>Henry</hi> had lost his Throne by his flagitious actions. And truly <hi>Rodolphus</hi> like a modest and just King sent Embassadours to let me know, he was forced to take the Government into his hand, though he was not so desirous of Dominion, but that he would rather obey us than those that had chosen him to the Kingdom. That he would always be at Gods and our disposal, and that we might believe him he offered his Sons for hostages for his performance. Thereupon <hi>Henry</hi> began to rage, and first to desire us, that we would use our spiritual Sword to depose <hi>Rodolphus.</hi> I answered him, That I would see who had most right, and would send Agents thither to examine the matter, and then I my self would judg whose cause was the juster. <hi>Henry</hi> would not suffer our Legates to determine the matter, but kill'd a great many men both Ecclesiastical and Laick, plunder'd and prophan'd Churches, and by this means made himself obnoxious to an <hi>Anathema.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I trusting in Gods mercy and judgment, in the patronage of the blessed Virgin, and relying upon your Authority, do lay <hi>Henry</hi> and his accomplices under a Curse; and once more deprive him of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power, interdicting all Christians (whom I absolve from all Oaths of Allegiance to him) from obeying <hi>Henry</hi> in any case whatever; but command 'em to receive <hi>Rodolphus</hi> as their King, whom many Princes of the Realm have chosen, since <hi>Henry</hi> was deposed. For it is fit, that seeing <hi>Henry</hi> is deprived of his Power for his pride and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, <hi>Rodolphus</hi> who is beloved by all should be invested with the Kingly power and dignity, for his Piety and Religion.

But <hi>Guiscard</hi> breaking in at the <hi>Porta del popolo,</hi> burnt the City all along to <hi>Domitian'</hi>s Triumphal Arch, though the people did what they could to resist him.

Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus made himself Master of <hi>Rome,</hi> and given the Citizens goods as plunder to his Soldiers, he march'd to Castle St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> where the Pope lay besieged, and freeing the miserable man at last from all his foes, he carried him along to <hi>Cassino</hi> and <hi>Salerno</hi> with him.

               <p>
                  <hi>URBAN</hi> the Second, before called <hi>Otho,</hi> or <hi>Oddo,</hi> at first a Monk of <hi>Eboina,</hi> and after that Cardinal of <hi>Ostia,</hi> was at last deservedly made Pope about five months after <hi>Victor'</hi>s death. For he was a very learned and an holy Man, and fit for any great Employment. At that time <hi>Roger</hi> took his opportunity (now <hi>Gregory</hi> was dead and a new Successor come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the place) to take <hi>Capua</hi> and all places that belong'd to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that and <hi>Tiber,</hi> from the Pope and the <hi>Romans.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Urban</hi> who could hardly trust the <hi>Romans,</hi> by reason of their former inclinations to Novelty, went to <hi>Melfi.</hi> Where being resolv'd to call a Synod, it was convenient to secure all people in their passage to it; and therefore he commanded <hi>Roger</hi> and <hi>Boemund</hi> who were at variance about the Dutchy of <hi>Puglia,</hi> to quit their Arms; upon this condition, that <hi>Roger</hi> should let <hi>Boemund</hi> have part of <hi>Puglia,</hi> and himself enjoy all the rest of his Father's Dominion. And when he had thus settled the <hi>Italian</hi> affairs to his mind, and put the Church in a good condition (as far as was possible in such an hurry) he went to <hi>Toia,</hi> to enquire what the Clergy of that place did, and to correct the errors of some ill-livers among 'em. But in the mean time <hi>Boemund,</hi> whilst his Brother <hi>Roger</hi> made War in <hi>Sicily</hi> against the <hi>Saracens,</hi> took <hi>Melfi</hi> by surprise. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Roger</hi> returning from <hi>Sicily,</hi> besieged his Brother <hi>Boemund</hi> at <hi>Melfi</hi> with twenty thousand <hi>Saracens</hi> which he hired to come along with him, though those within the City defended it very stoutly. The Pope, seeing he could have no quiet in <hi>Italy,</hi> design'd a Journey into <hi>France,</hi> but first held a Council at <hi>Piacenza,</hi> in which he wonderfully curb'd the licentiousness of some Clergymen. From thence he went into <hi>France,</hi> and began a thing very memorable. For he call'd a Council
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50681:127"/>
at <hi>Cleremont,</hi> wherein he so far animated the Princes of <hi>France</hi> toward the retaking of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which had been so long in the hands of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens,</hi> that in the year 1484. three hundred thousand Men enrolled themselves as Soldiers under Christ's Banner. After which he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Rome,</hi> with an intention, that when he had composed things in <hi>Italy,</hi> he would excite the <hi>Italians</hi> also to the same end. In the mean time King <hi>Henry</hi> wicked man, ceased not to affront <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> and provoke him to Battel, that he might divert him from the holy Expedition. Notwithstanding many followed one <hi>Peter</hi> an <hi>Eremite,</hi> who was a man of incomparable sanctity, and travelling through <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> arrived at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> then the common Seat of War. And they were not long after followed by <hi>Eustathius,</hi> and <hi>Baldwin</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named of <hi>Bulloign,</hi> men famous for feats of Arms. But besides these there was the Bishop of <hi>Pois, Raymund</hi> Earl of St. <hi>Giles, Hugo Magnus</hi> King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France'</hi>s Brother, and the two <hi>Roberts</hi> (whereof one was Earl of <hi>Normandy</hi> and the other of <hi>Flanders</hi>) together with <hi>Stephen</hi> Earl of <hi>Chartres,</hi> who passing over the <hi>Alps</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> came first to <hi>Rome.</hi> Where when they had visited the SSts. Tombs and Shrines, and received the Pope's Benediction, they went to <hi>Brundusium</hi> with an intent to go from thence into <hi>Albania.</hi> But because one Port would not hold'em all, some went to <hi>Bari</hi> and some to <hi>Otranto.</hi> But <hi>Boemund,</hi> who, we told you, had taken <hi>Melfi,</hi> being desirous of glory, left <hi>Melfi,</hi> and went upon the same Expedition with twelve thousand choice and young <hi>Italians.</hi> And this his Valour so prevail'd with his Brother <hi>Roger,</hi> that he laid down his Arms and promised that for the future all things betwixt him and his Brother should be equally shared: and presently sent his Son <hi>Tancred,</hi> who was desirous to go into the War along with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. By this time <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Eremite</hi> was come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and pitching his Camp in the Suburbs, did so much damage to the Citizens, not voluntarily, but through the licentiousness of his Soldiers, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> wish'd 'em all cut off. <hi>Alexius</hi> the Emperour was very much concerned for the injuries which his Subjects suffer'd, and therefore forced <hi>Peter</hi> for want of forage to pass the <hi>Bosphorus</hi> before he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. However being compelled to it <hi>Peter</hi> and his Men went over, and first going to <hi>Nicodemia,</hi> and then to <hi>Nicopoli,</hi> attaqued that City though it was well guarded by the <hi>Saracens.</hi> But they wanting provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to maintain the Siege, and the Christian Soldiers dying apace, they were worsted by the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> and forced to raise their Siege; but besides that, received such damage in their flight, that <hi>Reginald</hi> General of the <hi>Germans</hi> renounced the Christian faith, and surrender'd himself to them; and <hi>Peter</hi> went as it were back, like an Ambassadour to <hi>Constantinople</hi> without any Soldiers to attend him. This was welcome news to <hi>Alexius,</hi> who hoped, that the Christians, upon such a discomfiture, would quit that Expedition. But in the mean while other supplies came in, and <hi>Alexius</hi> finding that he could not beat 'em back with open force, he set upon 'em in the Night time as they were pitching their Camp in the Suburbs of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but to no purpose; for they that were posted there maintain'd their Camp with great courage, till the rest of the Soldiers awaked got to their Arms. They fought too the next day with small damage on either side. Then <hi>Boemund</hi> was sent to <hi>Alexius</hi> in the name of the Army, and partly by Menaces, partly by Promises induced him
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50681:128"/>
to enter into a League upon these terms: That they should not onely pass through his Territories with safety, but have all necessaries sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, and that whatever they took from the <hi>Saracens</hi> should be his, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> When he had so done, he repassed the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> and arrived first at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and then at <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> which was briskly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the <hi>Turks</hi> within: Both <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> being Allies at that time, in the War against the Christians, sixty thousand <hi>Turks</hi> who lay upon the adjacent Mountains, made signs to the Townsmen to sally out, while they set upon the Christian Camp; but were so briskly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed that they return'd to the Mountains without doing any execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet it was difficult to take the City, because all kind of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were carried into it by a Lake that joins to it, till the Lake being fill'd with small Vessels from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the Townsmen were so streightned for want of necessaries, that fifty two days after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Siege they surrender'd; the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were in Garrison there, being permitted to march out with their Arms and Baggage. After which the Christians fortified <hi>Nicopoli</hi> and then left it: and being forced to travel through Deserts, they divided their Army into two parts. But it so happen'd that <hi>Boemund</hi> sound out a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as they heard of it. They fought very smartly and a great while on both sides, nor could the Battel be ended but by the Night coming upon them: and in that fight it was found next day, that there were forty thousand men slain, either <hi>Turks, Medes, Syrians, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, Saracens</hi> or <hi>Arabians.</hi> But nevertheless <hi>Soliman</hi> made all the haste possible from thence, and bragging in all places that he was Victor, he met ten thousand <hi>Arabs</hi> who were acoming to the Army; whom he carried with him into <hi>Lycaonia</hi> to intercept the Christians passage and hinder Provisions from being carry'd thither. But the Christians being supply'd by the Corn then almost ripe upon the ground, arrived first at <hi>Iconium</hi> (the chief City of that Country) and having taken that by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, possess'd themselves of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> and <hi>Tarsos</hi> with the same success. Then <hi>Baldwin,</hi> a Man of great Courage and Wit, first got a Signiory in <hi>Asia;</hi> for he had <hi>Tarso</hi> and all that he took in that Country bestowed upon him: and not long after made himself Master of <hi>Edessa</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nista.</hi> From thence the bigger Army went into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> now called <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> minor, which submitting upon the first Onset, they made <hi>Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurus</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> who had fought on the Christian side, Governour of it. Afterward they took <hi>Coesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and then march'd on toward <hi>Antioch</hi> over the high Mountains. At that time <hi>Cassianus</hi> was King of <hi>Antioch,</hi> formerly called <hi>Reblata:</hi> but that same King who formerly govern'd all <hi>Asia</hi> double wall'd it, and called it by his own name; and built about it four hundred and sixty Towers. Here was also once St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Sea; and here were born <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangelist, and that <hi>Theophilus,</hi> to whom <hi>Luke</hi> directs his Gospel and the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles: and here Men that were regenerate by Baptism were first called <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and lived there a thousand years under Christian Government. Moreover, it appears that there were one hundred and sixty Bishops under the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi> before the <hi>Barbarians</hi> took it: and that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50681:128"/>
there were in it three hundred and sixty Parish Churches. In the year therefore of our Redemption 1491. <hi>Antioch</hi> began to be besieged with great application. At which time <hi>Urban,</hi> who was vexed with tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous insurrections, shut himself up for two years in the House of one <hi>Peter Leo</hi> a noble Citizen, near St. <hi>Nicolas'</hi>s Church. But when <hi>John Paganus,</hi> a most seditious Fellow, was dead, he was a little more at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and then he applied himself to settle the State of the Church. For he received into favour the Arch-bishop of <hi>Millain</hi> (before deposed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had been consecrated by one Bishop against the Canon and custom of Holy Church) he having by way of penance changed his habit and lived in a Monastery voluntarily and holily upon that account. And when he petition'd with all humility to send him a Pall he did it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd him to his Authority in this form of words: <q>We are persuaded by thy Letter to send thy Brotherhood a Pall together with the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Sea Apostolick; which kind of Honour was never before conferr'd upon any person absent from us.</q> After that he gave a Pall and several priviledges to the Arch bishop of <hi>Toledo</hi> (who came to <hi>Rome</hi> and swore fidelity to the Pope) and made him Primate of all <hi>Spain.</hi> But he laid a Curse upon the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> and all the Diocese of St. <hi>James:</hi> because he had thrown the Bishop of that Province into Prison without hearing what he had to say for himself. About the same time <hi>Henry</hi> Bishop of <hi>Soissons</hi> came to <hi>Urban</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and freely quitted his Bishoprick which he had received from the King of <hi>France,</hi> without any hopes of Restitution. Whereupon <hi>Urban</hi> (lest his Diocese should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for want of a Bishop) restored him to his Bishoprick, though he were unwilling to take it; but he was sworn in this manner: <q>I for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will not communicate with any that are excommunicated by this Sea, wittingly and willingly: nor will I ever be present at the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations of those that accept of Bishopricks or Abbies, against Law and Reason, from Laymen; and, so help me God, and this holy Gospel, I never intend to break my resolution.</q> So also they say he dealt with the Bishop of <hi>Bellay:</hi> Nor can any one say he was pertinacious for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so; for he knew how and when to alter his mind upon occasion, which every good Man should do. For when he had admitted a Clerk, whom <hi>Gibert</hi> the Anti-Pope had made a Sub deacon, to second Orders, he chang'd his mind, because it was a thing of ill Example, and like to be of very pernicious consequence. He confirm'd the Order of <hi>Cister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> which was first set up in <hi>Burgundy;</hi> and some say, the <hi>Carthusians</hi> began their Order in his time: though others say it was in the time of <hi>Victor</hi> III. But when <hi>Urban</hi> had settled the Church of God, not onely by his pains and Example, but by his Writings too which he set forth against the Hereticks, he died near St. <hi>Nicolas'</hi>s in the House of <hi>Peter Leo,</hi> an eminent Citizen, twelve years, four months, and nineteen days after he came to the Popedom, upon the 28th. of <hi>August.</hi> His Body was carried over <hi>Tiber,</hi> to avoid the contrivances of his Enemies, who would have done him an injury (if possible) after death, and buried very honourably in St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s at the <hi>Vatican.</hi>

For he admired <hi>Böemunds</hi> valour so much that he promised to surrender the City to 'em, if the rest of the Christians would let <hi>Böemund</hi> be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of it. The Christians when they enter'd the City, spared al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all, but onely that they were severe upon the <hi>Saracens:</hi> and <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sianus</hi> their King who fled to the Mountains, was kill'd by the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> They had taken all but the Castle; which whilest <hi>Böemund</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued, he was shot through the thigh with an Arrow, which pained him so, that he was fain to desist from the Siege for several days. But when <hi>Corbanes</hi> the King of <hi>persia'</hi>s General came up, with <hi>Sensadolus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianus'</hi>s Son, to retake <hi>Antioch, Böemund</hi> was by that time well of his Wound, met and would have engaged 'em. But the Enemy kept up in the Mountains and could not be tempted to fight by any means. Whereupon <hi>Böemund</hi> being necessitated for lack of Provisions was resolv'd to fight 'em though the place was much to his disadvantage. So he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that Lance wherewith <hi>Longinus</hi> pierced Christ's side (which they found in St. <hi>Andrew'</hi>s Church at <hi>Antioch</hi>) to be carry'd before 'em as the best Ensign they could have; and marching up to 'em he defeated them with the slaughter of an hundred thousand, though at first they made a brisk resistance. Besides that, they say there were fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Camels taken in their Camp; and so much plunder carry'd off, that from the greatest extremity of want they were advanced to the greatest abundance of all things necessary. The Governour of the Castle when he knew of it, surrender'd the Castle to <hi>Böemund</hi> and embraced the Christian Faith: and all that were in the Garrison, if they would do the like, were permitted to march off with Bag and Baggage whither they pleased. After that there arose a great debate betwixt <hi>Böemund</hi> and <hi>Raymund,</hi> when <hi>Böemund</hi> demanded <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Raymund</hi> said, it belong'd to the Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by the contract they had before freely made. But the Priests, to whom it was referr'd, gave it to <hi>Böemund</hi> without any more ado. In the mean time <hi>Hugo Magnus</hi> (who was gone to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to compose things) died, and then the other Officers (all but <hi>Raymund,</hi> who besieged <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to go to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> with their Army, and rendezvouz'd in <hi>Lycia.</hi> But by the way they attempted to take <hi>Tortosa,</hi> and after they had spent three months in vain, they raised the Siege, and march'd to <hi>Tripoli,</hi> the petit King of which place furnish'd 'em liberally with Mony, Provisions and Arms, and thereby obtain'd a Peace upon Condition, that he, if <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were taken, should embrace the Christian Religion.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Christians got what Provisions they could and attaqued the City in four places very fiercely, (whilest the <hi>Jerusalemites</hi> defended it as stoutly) and upon the 13th of <hi>July</hi> they took it by storm, the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ninth day after they began to besiege it, in the year 1499. four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety years after the <hi>Saracens</hi> took it under the Reign of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclius.

And the same day they had taken the Temple too, if Night had not come upon 'em. However the next day the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque was nenew'd, and quarter given to all that desired and would lay down their Arms. But the Christians, after such a Victory, when they had rested eight days from the toil of War, and had visited the holy places of the City and our Lord's Sepulchre, took <hi>Godfrey</hi> upon their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and carry'd him into the Palace, where by universal consent they chose him King. And he, though he did not refuse the Title of King, yet he would not have a golden Crown; because he thought it unseemly for any one to wear a golden Diadem, where Christ, the King of Kings wore one of Thorns when he redeemed mankind. Then also was <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulphus</hi> the Priest made Patriarch and consecrated by the Bishops that were there present.

Nay, they say that the same <hi>Albert</hi> foretold also the exact time that he should live in his Pontificate. But <hi>Paschal</hi> who consulted the good of the Church, then like to be ruin'd by seditious Men, sent out his Forces against <hi>Gibert</hi> the Anti-Pope, the Ring leader of all the mischief: And to render himself sufficient for so great a War, he borrowed seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Troops of <hi>Roger</hi> Earl of <hi>Sicily</hi> and a thousand ounces of Gold. <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> that Villain, lived then at <hi>Abba de Marsi:</hi> and when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that the Enemy was coming, he durst not trust to his own strength, which he had procured of <hi>Richard</hi> Count of <hi>Capua,</hi> but left <hi>Alba</hi> and went with all speed into the Mountains near <hi>Aquila,</hi> where not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he died suddenly and paid for all his iniquities.

But they also repented of what they had done, and one hundred and five days after turn'd him out of his Pontificate, compelled him to take upon him the habit of an <hi>Anchorite,</hi> and lead a private life. Besides these there was a Third also, one <hi>Maginulphus</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> who was so bold as to usurp the Title of <hi>Pope</hi> at <hi>Ravenna.</hi> But the <hi>Romans</hi> banish'd him, and those of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> when he had no Friend left, expelled him their City. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church being thus settled, <hi>Paschal,</hi> who was a Man of great Wit and Courage, diverted his Mind from Religion to Arms, and by the help of <hi>Roger,</hi> retook <hi>Castellana</hi> and <hi>Benevento</hi> from the Enemies. But in the mean time <hi>Peter Columna,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, by the advice of <hi>Richard</hi> Count of <hi>Capua</hi> (whose main design was to divide the Pope's Army) seiz'd upon <hi>Cava</hi> a Town in the Pope's Dominions. Thereupon the Pope marched against him, and not only retook <hi>Cava,</hi> but also took from him <hi>Zangarola</hi> and <hi>Columna,</hi> two Castles of his paternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; from whence the Family of the <hi>Columneses</hi> took their Title. There was another Family at <hi>Rome</hi> (called the <hi>Corsi</hi>) very powerful and so true to <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. that their Houses which were under the Capitol were burnt by <hi>Henry</hi> down to the ground; yet afterward <hi>Stephen,</hi> the chief of that Family, chang'd sides, and in <hi>Paschal'</hi>s absence surpriz'd St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Church, and the Castle hard by: from whence he continually teazed the City of <hi>Rome</hi> with inroads very strangely. For this reason the Pope omitted all forein Affairs, and return'd with all speed to the City, from whence he drove <hi>Stephen;</hi> who went safely off, disguised in a Monks Habit and so deceived those that came to take him. At that time many Authors say, there appeared a great many Prodigies; as, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

They tell you likewise that a Comet appeared of a vast bigness, that was seen at Sun-setting. <hi>Paschal</hi> however was not disturb'd at any of these things, because he knew 'em to be natural: But when he heard the Bishop of <hi>Florence</hi> should say, that Antichrist was born, he went immediately thither, and calling a Council, who discussed the matter very nicely, he perceived the Bishop was onely ambitious of being the Author of some great matter, and therefore when he had chid him he sent him away, and went himself into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> where he called an Assembly at <hi>Guardastallo</hi> of many Princes and Bishops, and held a long debate about Homages, Fees, and the Oaths of Bishops that had been or should be administred to Laymen. And hearing of the scandalous lives of the <hi>French</hi> Priests, he went into <hi>France,</hi> and at <hi>Troyes</hi> he called a Synod, in which having taken order for the more decent adorning of Churches, and partly expelled, partly chastised their Incumbents, he returned in haste into <hi>Italy,</hi> because he heard all things were there in an uproar. For <hi>Stephen Corsus</hi> had taken <hi>Montalto,</hi> and <hi>Pontechio</hi> from that part of <hi>Toscany</hi> which now they call St. <hi>Peter'</hi>s Patrimony, and had fortified them with Castles, from whence he pillaged the whole Country with frequent inroads; but the Pope fell upon him, and beat him out of one of his Castles; though he could not storm the other by reason of its situation, and the Winter season which was at hand. Going therefore
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50681:131"/>
into <hi>Puglia</hi> to compose the differences of those parts, he committed the care of the Church to the Bishop of <hi>Lavico;</hi> to <hi>Peter</hi> the Son of <hi>Leo,</hi> and to <hi>Leo</hi> the Son of <hi>Fregepan,</hi> the City and all its concerns, and to <hi>Ptolemy</hi> Lord of <hi>Subiaco,</hi> the territories adjacent, leaving his Nephew <hi>Godfrey,</hi> General, to assist them in the defence of the Churches jurisdiction. But in the Pope's absence, <hi>Ptolemy</hi> the reputed Author of all that mischief threatned he should never return to the City any more, and all these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the Church: to wit, <hi>Peter Columna,</hi> whom the Pope had taken into favour, the Abbat of <hi>Farfa,</hi> together with those of <hi>Anagni, Palestrina, Tivoli, Frascati,</hi> and <hi>Sabina.</hi> The same <hi>Ptolemy</hi> also raised an Army and besieged <hi>Alba</hi> in <hi>Campagna di Roma,</hi> which the Citizens very stoutly defended. But when the Pope and the Prince of <hi>Cajetta</hi> came up, together with <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Aquila,</hi> two excellent Commanders, they drove out these Usurpers that would have possessed themselves of the Church Revenues, and freeing <hi>Alba</hi> from the Siege, he also had the other revolting Towns surrender'd up to him, except that he was fain to storm <hi>Tivoli,</hi> which stood out very obstinately, and occasion'd much damage on both sides: though he took <hi>Montalto</hi> and turned out <hi>Stephen,</hi> and quieted the whole Patrimony in a short time.

In the mean time <hi>Paschal</hi> held a Council at the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and revok'd all that he had promised to <hi>Henry;</hi> because he was forc'd to do what he did, either out of fear of <hi>Henry</hi> or in pity to the Cardinals that were in bonds, or to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> whom <hi>Henry</hi> harass'd after an hostile manner, to make a Peace upon any terms. He therefore thought it better to retract what he had done amiss (since he was compelled) than to let other Princes take that for a Precedent, and think that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to do, which <hi>Henry</hi> onely extorted from him against his will.

of a Monk (under <hi>Stephen</hi> the Abbat, who was the third after the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Cistercians</hi> was erected) with thirty Fellows more, and was so much commended for his Learning and Piety, that in a short time he was made Abbat of <hi>Clarevalle,</hi> a Monastery built by one <hi>Robert</hi> a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great honour, and there he lived and govern'd with great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for thirty six years. And when he (that is <hi>Bernard</hi>) died, he left, besides the same of his sanctity, a great many Monuments of his Wit in writing: especially his Commentaries upon the <hi>Canticles,</hi> and his considerations of divine Contemplation dedicated to <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Pope, from whence he might learn the duty of a Pope. He likewise wrote many Epistles; one above the rest to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in which he much blames 'em: as also an Apology, and some Sermons upon solemn occasions. But to return to <hi>Paschal,</hi> who decreed in a Council held at <hi>Guardastallo,</hi> that no Cities of <hi>Romagna,</hi> as <hi>Piacenza, Parma, Reggio, Modena,</hi> nor <hi>Bologna</hi> should be any longer subject to <hi>Ravenna</hi> which had been formerly the Metropolis and Mother-Church: because the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Ravenna</hi> had often exalted their horns against the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea. But when the Pope came back to the City, the People desired him that he would make <hi>Peter's</hi> Son Governour of the City, upon the death of his Father who was so in his life time: which the Pope denying to do by reason of his nonage (for he was scarce ten years old) there was such a tumult of a sudden, that he was forced to leave the City, for fear of some great mischief; for there were many, that said it was not fit that such a Boy should be intrusted with such a weighty Employment. But that would not do; for when he was at <hi>Alba,</hi> and heard that <hi>Peter Leo</hi> (a great friend to the Church) was set upon in his own House by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Faction, he immediately sent <hi>Ptolomy</hi> from <hi>Ariccia</hi> with a good competent number of Men to assist him; who drove the Enemy over the <hi>Tiber,</hi> killing some and taking others whom he divided among the several Towns, to be kept. But there soon appeared great inconstancy in <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> For those whom he had taken but a little before, he set upon by surprise as they went through the <hi>Selva del Aglio</hi> by his Order to the several Towns, and took 'em again and carry'd 'em with him to <hi>Ariccia:</hi> among whom was also the dead Governour's Son. Nor was <hi>Ptolomy</hi> content to do so onely, but he possess'd himself of <hi>Sarmoneta Nymphaeo, Tiberia,</hi> and the Sea-coasts, In the mean time <hi>Henry</hi> came out of <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> with an Army which strook terrour into all that heard of it.

that <hi>Henry</hi> was gone, all things would be in a peaceable condition at <hi>Rome</hi> hereafter; but he was very much deceiv'd in his opinion; for he was soon after inform'd that the Anti-pope upheld by the power of the <hi>Frangipani</hi> continued still at <hi>Rome,</hi> out of fear of which Family he staid privately a while in the House of a Friend; but afterward as he was say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mass in the Church of <hi>Praxede,</hi> his Enemies with their Party rush'd in, and he had much ado to escape out of their hands by flight, some of the <hi>Corsi</hi> and <hi>Normanni,</hi> two great Families, with his Nephew <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentius</hi> fighting briskly in his defence. The next day guarded by his Retinue and Friends in Arms, he return'd to the City from <hi>S. Paul's</hi> (whither he had fled) and consulting with his Cardinals, he resolv'd to leave the City, lest the Uproars every day encreasing some great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief might ensue. Having therefore left to <hi>Peter</hi> Bishop of <hi>Porto,</hi> the Vicegerency in Ecclesiastical affairs at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to <hi>Hugo</hi> Cardinal of the Twelve Apostles the care of <hi>Benevento,</hi> he sail'd first to <hi>Pisa,</hi> not conceiving the way by Land to be secure for himself and the Cardinals who accompanied him; where he in the audience of the whole City related the causes of his departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> and was received with great kindness by the <hi>Pisans;</hi> thence setting sail for <hi>France,</hi> he arrived at <hi>S. Giles's,</hi> and was there entertain'd by the Abbat of <hi>Clugni</hi> and his Monks with many others who came for that purpose, very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and splendidly. Then he cross'd the middle of <hi>France</hi> with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable rather than sumptuous attendance, (which now adays is the fashion) by the way dedicating the Churches of <hi>S.

Coming at last to the Monastery of <hi>Clugni,</hi> he was taken with a Plurisie, and died, having been Pope one year and five days. He was a most holy Man and very praise-worthy both for his life and doctrin; so that I cannot doubt, considering the integrity of his life, and his religious constancy amidst the many storms and troubles he underwent, but that he now enjoys Eternity among the blessed in Heaven. He was buried in the Porch of the said Monastery. Some write, that in his time the Order of Knights Templers first began, who living not far from the Holy Sepulcre, entertain'd Pilgrims and accompanied them in Arms in their journeys to and from the holy Places, which by their means might be visited with all safety. These Knights <hi>Cusentinus</hi> commends highly for their holy Christian Lives.</p>

But so great a Province not being to be govern'd without a Lieutenant, he made <hi>Raymund</hi> Son to <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria</hi> their Governour, whose Wife was the Daughter of <hi>Boemund</hi> the elder; and having thus setled mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he went against the King of <hi>Ascalon,</hi> who being assisted with forces from <hi>Aegypt</hi> infested the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Afterward <hi>Baldequan</hi> a petit King of <hi>Damascus</hi> attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same thing, but with greater forces, he overthrew him in three fierce Battels, his men in their flight being kill'd up and down like sheep. To return to <hi>Honorius;</hi> though his Parentage was mean, yet for his excellent Learning and conversation he was every way worthy of so high a Dignity; not but that the methods by which he obtain'd it were not altogether commendable, the Election having been procur'd rather by the ambition of some private Men than by unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. For when upon the death of <hi>Calistus,</hi> the Consultation was held about chusing a new Pope, <hi>Leo Frangipane</hi> imposed upon the <hi>Conclave,</hi> that the Election should be deferred for three days, under pretence of more mature deliberation and a stricter search into the Ecclesiastical Canons; though neither of these were part of his design, but it was craftily and politickly done by him, to gain time in which Votes might be procur'd for the choice of <hi>Lambert.</hi> The People were extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to have had the Cardinal of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> which <hi>Frangipane</hi> also pretended, that so he might by this trick draw over the People and the unwary Fathers; which some of the Cardinals observing, because they would not have a Pope according to his mind, they set aside the Cardinal of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and chose <hi>Theobald</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Anastasio,</hi> Pope, by the name of <hi>Coelestine. Leo</hi> now thought it no time to dally, but perceiving the People were displeased at that choice, declares <hi>Lambert</hi> aforesaid for Pope, with great acclamations of the Citizens, the Clergy also appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it; and that the People might not have time to change their minds, he immediately clothes him with the Pontifical Vestments in the <hi>Scinie,</hi> a place near S. <hi>Sylvester'</hi>s Church. He, though it was not without slight that he got the Popedom, yet was afterward universally saluted and own'd as such. As soon as he was made Pope, he created several worthy Persons Cardinals, of whose assistance he constantly made use in all his difficult affairs; being very much delighted with the conversation of excellent Men, which was the reason that he detain'd at <hi>Rome</hi> with him <hi>Pontius</hi> Abbat of <hi>Clugni,</hi> a very diligent person; and shew'd great respect to the extraordinary parts of <hi>Hildebert</hi> Bishop of <hi>Mans,</hi> whom for the sake of his skill at Heroic or Elegiac Verse he promoted afterward to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishoprick of <hi>Tours.</hi> This age was rendred also more illustrious by <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go de Sancto Victore,</hi> a famous Doctor of <hi>Paris,</hi> who then flourish'd, who

Emperour of the <hi>Greeks</hi> over-perſuaded him to take his journey ſtraight on to <hi>Iconium,</hi> without taking care of proviſion, aſſuring him that himſelf would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Army with whatſoever ſhould be neceſſary. Whereupon that City, well fortified both by Art and Nature, was cloſely beſieg'd a great while; but the wicked Emperour ſhew'd them a <hi>Greek</hi> Trick, and mix'd Lime with their Meal, with which the bread was made for the whole Army of the Chriſtians, and this kill'd ſo many of the Soldiers, that they were forc'd to raiſe the Siege and return into <hi>France,</hi> without having done any thing. Some advantage yet this Expedition may be ſaid to have given the Chriſtians, becauſe King <hi>Baldwin</hi> IV. of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> took ſuch courage upon it as to beſiege and take by ſtorm the City of <hi>Aſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> having alſo a little before rebuilt the antient City <hi>Gaza,</hi> (then almoſt deſerted by the Enemy) giving it for a dwelling place to the Knights Templars. Beſide the ſame <hi>Baldwin</hi> gave a bold repulſe to ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Chieftains who infeſted the Inhabitants of <hi>Jericho,</hi> of whom in one ſingle Battel he is ſaid to have kill'd five thouſand. Moreover <hi>Noradine</hi>

Governour of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> invading the territories of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was met withal by <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and totally routed, ſo that in the purſuit the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were with much ado kept off from entring the City of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> pel-mel with the Enemy. But to return to Pope <hi>Lucius</hi>; he omitted no care nor pains in promoting that ſo conſiderable and neceſſary Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I ſuppoſe, he was much the more concern'd in his mind for it, becauſe before he was Pope, he was Cardinal Prieſt of S. <hi>Croſs</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Church whereof he almoſt wholly re-built. By his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, a national Council was held in <hi>France</hi> of ſeveral Biſhops and Abbats, againſt <hi>Peter Abelardus</hi> a Peripatetic Philoſopher, and a very learned Man, who had maintain'd ſome heterodox Opinions; but was in the preſence of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> ſo effectually convinc'd, that he not only chang'd his mind, but took upon him the life and order of a Monk, and afterward together with ſome of his Scholars led a moſt holy life ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the World in a deſert place. <hi>Lucius,</hi> after he had been Pope eleven months and four days, died and was buried in the <hi>Lateran.</hi>

There is but one ſmall River in that Country, which running not far from the City Walls, makes a little tongue of Land in which their Camp was pitch'd, whereby they eaſily could hinder the Citizens from fetching Water; but a certain <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> to whom in difficult matters <hi>Baldwin</hi> was wont to give great credit, over-perſuaded him to remove his Camp to the other ſide of the Town, pretending that it might with more eaſe be there expugnable, becauſe the Walls were not ſo ſtrong; which was no ſooner done, but thoſe of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> poſſeſs'd themſelves of the place where our Men had encamp'd, and having entrench'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtop'd all the Water and Proviſions that the Chriſtians wanted: So that being preſs'd with hunger and thirſt, they were forc'd diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably to raiſe the Siege, from which <hi>Baldwin</hi> went to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> and <hi>Conrade</hi> took their march to <hi>Europe,</hi> whither they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd <hi>An.

The <hi>Romans</hi> had now choſen Conſuls who were Friends to <hi>Alexander,</hi> they immediatey recall him out of <hi>France,</hi> and he taking Ship arrives firſt in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and thence comes to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was very kindly receiv'd with univerſal acclamations; and the People of <hi>Lombardy</hi> were by the arrival of <hi>Alexander</hi> put in hopes of retrieving their liberty, ſo that they took up Arms againſt <hi>Frederic</hi> who had uſed them ſo tyrannically, and drove ſeveral of his Garriſons out of their Towns, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1165. <hi>Frederic</hi> hereupon marches with a numerous Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> and without doing damage to any one, contrary to all expectation , enters the Territory of <hi>Bononia,</hi> where he divides his Army, and ſends ſome Battalions to <hi>Luca,</hi> to be a Guard to the Anti-Pope who then reſided there, whilſt he inveſts <hi>Ancona</hi> with his Army, and after a Siege of ſome time takes it. In the mean time the aſſociated Cities of <hi>Lombardy</hi> re-edifie <hi>Milan</hi> and fortifie it, and receive thoſe of <hi>Lodi,</hi> who had been Enemies to the <hi>Milaneſes,</hi> into their Confederacy, the more to enable them to reſiſt <hi>Frederick,</hi> if he ſhould invade them: But <hi>Frederick</hi> had ſomewhat of greater moment to think of; for upon the death of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman</hi> King of <hi>Sicily, Emanuel</hi> Emperour of <hi>Greece</hi> had ſent Ambaſſadours to the Pope to offer him a great Army to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50681:141"/>
be employ'd againſt <hi>Frederick</hi> and to promiſe a perfect agreement of all the <hi>Grecians</hi> with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſo the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches might be all one, if he would ſuffer the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, to be again reduc'd into one body. What Anſwer theſe Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours receiv'd is not certain, for by reaſon of a War then begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Romans</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Tuſculum</hi> and <hi>Alba,</hi> the Pope could not give them a poſitive reſolution. The cauſe of this was that the <hi>Romans</hi> being too rigorous in the exaction of their Gabels, the <hi>Tuſculans</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> denied to pay them, which enraged the People of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo, that they march'd out contrary to the Pope's will, againſt them tumultuouſly; but at that time <hi>Raino,</hi> (who had been ſttip'd of the Dukedom of <hi>Puglia</hi> by <hi>Roger</hi>) bore the chief ſway among the <hi>Tuſculans,</hi> a Man well skill'd in the Arts of War, who ſending for the <hi>German</hi> Soldiers from <hi>Nepi</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri,</hi> made ſo great a ſlaughter among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they afterwards had much ado to defend their Walls, much leſs could they meet an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the Field. <hi>Frederick</hi> took this occaſion to avenge the wrongs (as he call'd 'em) which <hi>Alexander</hi> had done him, and leaving <hi>Ancona</hi> leads his Army to <hi>Rome,</hi> and encamps in the <hi>Prati di Nerone,</hi> from whence he made an Attack upon the <hi>Vatican</hi> Suburb, but was ſtoutly repell'd by the Friends of <hi>Alexander.</hi> The next day he attempted to ſet fire to S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, and had effected it, if thoſe who had the care of it would have ſuffered it, and the Pope not thinking himſelf ſafe in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> into which he ſaw the <hi>Germans</hi> would ſoon enter, remov'd to the Houſe of the <hi>Frangipani</hi> near the <hi>Palladio. William</hi> King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi> Son of the Great <hi>William,</hi> hearing of the Pope's danger, ſent him a good ſum of Money and two Gallies well man'd; which came in good time, for <hi>Frederick</hi> having promiſed Peace to the <hi>Romans,</hi> was very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent with them, of the two Popes to chuſe the more worthy, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reject the other, which when <hi>Alexander</hi> knew muſt be done as the Emperour ſhould pleaſe, he embark'd in the Gallies and eſcap'd firſt to <hi>Gaieta,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Benevent. Frederick</hi> afterward was driven from the City by a Plague of which both Citizens and Soldiers died like Sheep, and as he march'd back through <hi>Lombardy,</hi> the Army of the Confederate Cities met him, and urg'd him to a Battel, which he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully declin'd and arriv'd in <hi>Germany.</hi> When he was departed, the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates built a City at their common charge near <hi>Roueretto</hi> upon the River <hi>Taro,</hi> which from the name of the Pope they call'd <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to inhabit which from all the Cities they ſent fifteen thouſand Men, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ground equally among 'em, and ſetting out the dimenſions of their Streets and Houſes. The <hi>Romans</hi> yet regretted the ſlaughter made among 'em by the <hi>Tuſculans</hi> and their Friends, and therefore upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of <hi>Frederick</hi> they took <hi>Alba</hi> and demoliſh'd it, and had done the like by <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> if the Pope had not terrified them with Threats and Anathema's from doing ſo great a miſchief. At this time <hi>Emanuel</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſent other Ambaſſadours with greater Promiſes than before, if the Pope could be brought to comply with his deſire; to whom <hi>Alexander</hi> gave this Anſwer, that he was not willing to unite what his Predeceſſors had thought good induſtriouſly to disjoin. In the mean time <hi>Guy</hi> the Anti-Pope died in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, which was ſtill ſtrongly garriſon'd by <hi>Frederick,</hi> in whoſe room the ſeditious ſubſtituted <hi>John</hi> a <hi>Hungarian,</hi> Abbat of <hi>Sirmio,</hi> who had before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50681:141"/>
of a Thief; to him <hi>Raino,</hi> (who was afraid of the <hi>Romans</hi> upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the miſchief he had formerly done them) deliver'd up <hi>Tuſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> upon condition that he ſhould have <hi>Monte-fiaſcone</hi> in lieu of it; but when <hi>Raino</hi> went to take poſſeſſion of it, the Inhabitants would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, neither would the <hi>Tuſculans</hi> ſubmit to the Anti-Pope, upon which he return'd to <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> but was forbidden entrance. From thence therefore he went to <hi>Alexius</hi> who was then at <hi>Veruli,</hi> and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to him all his Title to the place, which when the <hi>Tuſculans</hi> heard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mature deliberation by a publick Decree they acknowledg'd their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Pope, and receiv'd him. Here it was that the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> were heard, when they came to clear their King of the falſe Accuſation of having conſpir'd the death of S. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But the Pope not eaſily giving credit to the King's Ambaſſadours, ſent two Cardinals into <hi>England</hi> with ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Power to examine the matter; to whom <hi>Henry</hi> paid ſo great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that though he was engag'd in a War with <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet he came as far as <hi>Normandy</hi> to meet 'em. Upon debating the caſe, it came to this end, that <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould by an Oath, (becauſe the matter of fact was not clear) purge himſelf, and promiſe to do Penance for the murther of that holy Man; of which though he were not guilty nor conſcious, yet it ſeem'd that the great ſpite and grudg he bore him in his life-time, had given ſome occaſion to the aſſaſſination; and moreover, that he ſhould raiſe and maintain two hundred Soldiers for a year to aſſiſt the Chriſtians in the Holy Land; that he ſhould within three years himſelf, with what force he could raiſe, undertake an Expedition to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: that he ſhould conſerve the Eccleſiaſtical immunities in his Realm, and not oppoſe any Appeals that might be made by his Subjects to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> All theſe Conditions he having ſworn to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, he had (and, he deſerv'd it) the right and Title to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> confer'd upon him and his Heirs, with the Pope's conſent. Hence it may be obſerv'd, that all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings acknowledg them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have receiv'd the Title to their Realms of the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Alexander</hi> having long ſtrugled with the <hi>Romans,</hi> offered them, if they would admit him into the City, to leave the whole Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their own managery, and to intermeddle onely in religious matters; but this would not be granted by them, ſo he retir'd to <hi>Segna,</hi> and there being inform'd by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadours of the Miracles wrought by S. <hi>Thomas [Becket]</hi> he canoniz'd him. <hi>Frederick</hi> now returning into <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Monceniſi,</hi> took <hi>Seculia</hi> by treachery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd it; he took alſo <hi>Aſti</hi> which ſurrendered for fear, and laid cloſe Siege four months to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> but receiv'd ſo much loſs from the Sallies of the beſieged, that he grew weary of it and on <hi>Eaſter</hi> day roſe up from before it and went to <hi>Pavia</hi>; where a Treaty for the peace of <hi>Italy</hi> was carried on, by the mediation of the Pope, which the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> were willing to embrace; who though they had been favourers of <hi>Emanuel</hi> before, yet had receiv'd from him a horrid affront contrary to the Law of Nations; for he had with red hot plates of Braſs blinded their Ambaſſadour <hi>Henry Dandalo</hi> by holding them before his Eyes. Mean time <hi>Almeric</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> raiſed his Siege from before <hi>Cairo,</hi> though he was not without hopes of carrying the place, but was bought off with a great ſum of Money, and afterward march'd againſt <hi>Aſcalon</hi>;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50681:142"/>
but was forc'd to quit that Expedition, being in great want of proviſions, and finding his Soldiers to be very much tired and broken with the great and tedious toils of War they had undergone. He did not long outlive his return, but died and left his Kingdom to his Son <hi>Baldwin,</hi> who though he labour'd with a dangerous Leproſie, yet he manag'd his Government with great conſtancy and Wiſdom. <hi>Alexander</hi> thinking now to enjoy a perfect Peace, made the new City of <hi>Alexandria</hi> a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Sea, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1177. but ſoon after <hi>Frederick</hi> re-enters <hi>Italy</hi> with great Forces and put all into confuſion, till the <hi>Milaneſes</hi> with the joint forces of the Confederates ſo broke his Troops with frequent Onſets that in one of them <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Horſe was kill'd under him and he nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſcap'd with life himſelf; many of thoſe of <hi>Pavia</hi> and <hi>Como</hi> being on his ſide were loſt. The Biſhop of <hi>Pavia</hi> alſo becauſe he took the Emperour's part, was by the Pope deprived of his Pall and the honour of bearing the Croſs. <hi>Frederic</hi>'s great Men thought theſe miſchiefs happen'd to 'em, becauſe they perſecuted the Church of God, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatned to return into their own Country and leave that wicked Warfare, except he would be reconcil'd to the Pope ſpeedily. A Treaty then was begun for the Peace of <hi>Italy</hi>; when <hi>Saladine</hi> a Perſon of great courage ſucceeded <hi>Noradine</hi> then deceaſed, in the Empire of the <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens,</hi> who having taken and ſlain the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> added that Country and <hi>Syria</hi> to his Dominion; not that his ſucceſs was alike when he fought with the Chriſtians, being defeated by <hi>Baldwin</hi> in two Battels, one at <hi>Aſcalon</hi> and another at <hi>Tiberias</hi>; but ſoon after gathering his forces together, he march'd into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> to meet with <hi>Emanuel,</hi> whoſe Army by a feigned flight he drew into narrow and difficult ways, where he ſet upon 'em and vanquiſh'd 'em, taking the Emperour Priſoner, whom he ſet at large again, upon condition that he ſhould quit what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he had taken in <hi>Aſia.</hi> At this time <hi>Alexander</hi> was met at <hi>Venice</hi> by <hi>Frederic,</hi> there to treat of a Peace, where in S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Porch the Emperour kiſs'd the Pope's feet; and from thence they went together to the high Altar, and having perform'd the mutual Ceremonies of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they diſcours'd a great while upon the Articles of the Peace, which the next day was concluded. Hence the Emperour with the good leave of the Pope, departed firſt to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and then to <hi>Bertinoro,</hi> which Town he deſign'd to keep in his hands, becauſe of the commodiouſneſs of its ſituation, but the Pope at laſt perſuaded him to reſtore it to the Church. <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo left <hi>Venice,</hi> (having firſt made ſeveral Preſents and conferr'd many honours upon that State for the ſervices they had done him) and with thirteen Gallies of <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> and four of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he ſail'd firſt to <hi>Siponto</hi> and from thence to <hi>Troia,</hi> and <hi>Benevent,</hi> and then paſſing S. <hi>Germano</hi> he went to <hi>Anagni</hi>; where he ſtaid not long but came to <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> to treat with the <hi>Romans</hi> about depoſing the Conſuls they had ſet up before a Peace ſhould be concluded; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Conſuls had been ſo choſen for fifty years, it was found to be a difficult thing to alter the cuſtom; wherefore they agreed that thereafter no one that was choſen Conſul ſhould enter upon his Office, till he had taken an Oath to be dictated by the Pope, that he would be true to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and never attempt any thing that ſhould be a violation of the Pontifical Dignity. Thus all matters being ſettled, the Pope went the third time to <hi>Rome,</hi> all the great Men of the City coming forth to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50681:142"/>
and congratulate him; ſoon after he held a Council in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> partly to find a way to reform the great licentiouſneſs of that Court, but chiefly that it might be decreed, that no Man under pain of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema</hi> ſhould furniſh the Infidels with Iron, Wood or any ſort of Arms. At this time died <hi>Emanuel</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> leaving his Son <hi>Alexius</hi> heir of his Empire, under the Guardianſhip of <hi>Andronicus,</hi> one of the blood Royal, who for ſome years ſhew'd great prudence and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in his publick Adminiſtrations; and by his conſent the young Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was married to <hi>Agnes</hi> Daughter to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France. Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> IV. alſo King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſtrengthen himſelf by the Alliance, married his Siſter <hi>Sibyl</hi> to <hi>William</hi> ſurnam'd <hi>Long-ſword,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> an excellent Soldier, not doubting but that upon occaſion <hi>William</hi> and other Princes of Chriſtendom would come to his aſſiſtance if his affairs were in any danger. Mean time <hi>Alexander</hi> after having undergone ſo many and continual labours, when now he ſeem'd to be at reſt from all his troubles, died at <hi>Rome</hi> when he had been Pope twenty one years nineteen days, having yet liv'd to ſee four Anti-Popes go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, who with their factions had almoſt deſtroy'd the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

Now alſo <hi>William</hi> ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Long-ſword</hi> dying at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> King <hi>Baldwin</hi> taking care of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, married his Siſter <hi>Sibyl</hi> again to <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Luſignan,</hi> a <hi>Picard,</hi> upon condition, that after his own deceaſe <hi>Guy</hi> ſhould enjoy the Kingdom du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the nonage of his Nephew <hi>Baldwin,</hi> after which he ſhould reſign it to him. All which was confirm'd by the Pope's Authority, who thought it very neceſſary for the Chriſtian Cauſe, that the Princes of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſhould be knit together with the ſtricteſt bonds of Amity and Friendſhip, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable them the better to reſiſt the inſults of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Saracens:</hi> but he was quickly after expell'd the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> while by the favour of ſome Citizens he attempted to aboliſh the Office of the Conſuls, and his Friends in that affair being taken had their Eyes put out. Upon this horrid affront the Pope betook himſelf to <hi>Verona</hi> and call'd a Council, where the exorbitant pride and licentiouſneſs of the <hi>Romans</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and all Chriſtian Princes were exhorted to afford aſſiſtance to the holy War; eſpecially becauſe <hi>Saladine</hi> had entred and waſted the Territories of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> encouraged by the diſſenſion among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Commanders; who had turn'd out <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Luſignan</hi> for his Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,

from the Government, and had ſubſtituted <hi>Bertrand</hi> Count of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli,</hi> Protector in his room, ſo that all things ſeem'd to threaten a Civil War. But the Pope inceſſantly perſuaded them by Letters and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to lay by their Animoſities, and with one heart and the ſame mind to oppoſe the common Enemy, at leaſt ſo long as till freſh Auxiliary forces could be ſent to 'em. For by the inſtance of <hi>Heraclius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who came for that purpoſe firſt to <hi>Verona,</hi> and thence went to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> upon the ſame Errand, a good number of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers under the Croſs were liſted and ſent away: But <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> in an ill time, deſigning to revenge the wrongs offered to the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> by <hi>Andronicus</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> paſſing into <hi>Greece</hi> with his Army, confounded all things; for he took <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> the chief City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> by ſtorm, and haraſſing many other of his Territories he took and plundered ſeveral Cities, <hi>Adronicus</hi> not appearing againſt him, being hated of God and Man, for the many murthers and baniſhments he had been the Author of.

Upon which it became eaſie for Pope <hi>Lucius</hi> to perſuade King <hi>William</hi> to make Peace with <hi>Iſaac</hi> and with Promiſes and Rewards to prevail with him to turn his Arms againſt the <hi>Aſians</hi>; but while this matter was tranſacting by Internuntio's this excellent Pope died in the fourth year ſecond month and eighteenth day of his Papacy, at <hi>Verona</hi> and was buried with great Pomp before the Altar of the Cathedral Church. This Pope had a great regard for his own Country and conſer'd upon it many advantages both Civil and Spiritual before he died; particularly he obtain'd of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour with whom he all his time kept a peaceable correſpondence, that the Mony of <hi>Lucca</hi> onely ſhould be current in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> as that of <hi>Pavia</hi> with the Imperial ſtamp went onely among the <hi>Lombards,</hi> which People by the means of this Pope were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd to the Emperour. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> of <hi>Lucca</hi> writes that there flouriſh'd at this time, <hi>Peter Comeſtor,</hi> who wrote the Hiſtory of both Teſtaments, and <hi>Joachim</hi> an Abbat of a Monaſtery which himſelf built at <hi>Calabria,</hi> famous for his Learning and for his skill in Divination, which he uſed to practiſe in doubtful and enigmatical terms.</p>

This <hi>Raimund</hi> Count of <hi>Tripoli</hi> highly reſented, and that he might the more eaſily work his revenge, he made a Truce with <hi>Saladine</hi>; by which means the Provinces of <hi>Tripoli, Tiberias</hi> and <hi>Galilee</hi> were torn from the Chriſtians; for they were then ſubject to <hi>Raimund</hi> in right of his Wife whom he had newly married; and leſt a pretence for making War (which <hi>Saladine</hi> earneſtly ſought) ſhould be wanting to him, the Prince of <hi>Monreal,</hi> a Chriſtian, in whoſe Dominion was a great part of the Country beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> and who was wont to ſupply in great abundance <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with Corn, inconſiderately broke the Truce with him. <hi>Saladine</hi> looking upon the time to be come at laſt which he had ſo long deſired, raiſed a great Army of Horſe and Foot, and ſtoutly aſſaulted <hi>Ptolemais</hi> then gariſon'd by the Templers. In this Action the Templers got the better, but with the loſs of their choiceſt Men; for their grand Maſter and many other of their moſt skilful and couragious Soldiers were ſlain. <hi>Saladine</hi> hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reinforces his Army, and taking courage from their diſtreſs, preſſes more hardly upon them. <hi>Raymund</hi> obſerving this and not thinking good to give too much credit to <hi>Saladine,</hi> leaves his Wife at <hi>Tiberias</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Tripoli</hi> renews his friendſhip with King <hi>Guy,</hi> ſlighting his Treaty before had with the <hi>Barbarians</hi>: ſo that <hi>Saladine</hi> having a fair occaſion to make War upon him, draws off from <hi>Ptolemais</hi> and marches towards <hi>Tiberias.</hi> All the Chriſtians then, but eſpecially the Templers, urging that their Army might march againſt <hi>Saladine,</hi> King <hi>Guy</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſets upon him in his Camp, which was pitch'd in a pleaſant place and well-watered, but was repulſed, after which he encamping in an incommodious and extream dry ground where the Chriſtians ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much by thirſt, himſelf was forc'd to fight and was defeated with great ſlaughter. In this unfortunate Battel moſt of the Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders were taken Priſoners, as was alſo King <hi>Guy</hi> and the Maſter of the Templers; many of whom were afterwards beheaded. <hi>Saladine</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gain'd this Victory, marches to <hi>Acon,</hi> which was immediately ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred by the Chriſtians, who were permitted to depart onely with their Clothes, and thence following his good fortune, he takes <hi>Berylus, Byblos</hi> and all the Towns upon the Sea-coaſt; thoſe of <hi>Aſcalon</hi> onely truſting to the ſtrength of their fortifications, told him they would not yield to him except he were firſt poſſeſs'd of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But the excellent temper and faithfulneſs of <hi>Saladine</hi> did the Chriſtians much harm; for he was ſo affable to every one, that Subjection to him was a deſireable condition. He, notwithſtanding the big words of the <hi>Aſcalonites,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts the place and after a Siege of ten days had it deliver'd up to him, upon condition that he would ſet at liberty King <hi>Guy</hi> and the Maſter of the Templers who were then his Priſoners. That which made <hi>Saladine</hi> thus haſten the Surrender of this place, was, he heard that <hi>Conrade</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Montferrat</hi> was arriv'd at <hi>Tyre</hi> with the Fleet of <hi>Iſaac</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> (whoſe Siſter he had lately married) under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and that <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> was expected in a ſhort time with forty Gallies. The tidings of theſe glorious ſucceſſes of <hi>Saladine</hi> againſt the Chriſtians coming to the <hi>Turks</hi> in the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſo fill'd 'em with emulation, that they march'd againſt <hi>Laodicea</hi> and took it, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:50681:144"/>
from thence they invaded the Territories of <hi>Antioch</hi>; but they were there vanquiſh'd by the Chriſtians with as great loſs on their ſide as the Chriſtians ſuffered from <hi>Saladine.</hi> At this time <hi>Saladine</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and carried on the Siege with ſo great diligence, that thoſe who were in Gariſon being out of hopes of ſuccour, (after the taking of it by the Chriſtians under <hi>Godfrey</hi> eighty eight years) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd it up, on condition that whoſoever ſhould be minded to leave the City ſhould go freely, with ſo much and no more than they could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their ſhoulders. The Chriſtians who came forth of it went ſome to <hi>Tyre,</hi> ſome to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and ſome to <hi>Alexandria</hi>; from whence many ſail'd with the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Fleet into <hi>Italy.

But his young Son <hi>Alexius</hi> eſcap'd by flight to the Chriſtian Camp, and begs the aſſiſtance of thoſe Commanders for his Father againſt the Uſurper, which they conſented to give him, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that his end being atchiev'd, the <hi>Greek</hi> Church ſhould be ſubjected to the <hi>Latin,</hi> and that thirty thouſand Marks of Gold ſhould be paid for the damage which <hi>Emanuel</hi> the late Emperour had done to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi>; and thus when they had agreed, they ſet ſail from <hi>Zara</hi> and paſſing by <hi>Candy,</hi> that Iſland ſubmitted itſelf, which young <hi>Alexius</hi> beſtow'd upon his Kinſman <hi>Boniface</hi> of <hi>Montferrat.</hi> Hence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which while they beſieged by Sea and Land, <hi>Theodore Laſcari</hi> Son-in-law to <hi>Alexius</hi> endeavouring to ſally forth, was driven back, and the City after two days cloſe Siege was taken by ſtorm, <hi>Alexius</hi> got away in the night, leaving behind him a great quantity of Gold in the cuſtody of <hi>Irene,</hi> a Nun. <hi>Iſaac</hi> the Father with his Son <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexius</hi> then entred the City, but liv'd not long after; the Father dying of ſickneſs and the Son being poiſon'd.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:50681:147"/>
his Enemies, he took his way to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> intending to go meet the Turkiſh Sultan of <hi>Iconium,</hi> who having taken the City <hi>Satellia</hi> from the <hi>Greeks</hi>; did much and continually incommode the Chriſtians. <hi>Innocent</hi> encompaſs'd thus with Enemies raiſed what Forces ſoever he could to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce from time to time our Armies: but when he heard that <hi>Hilmino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> a <hi>Saracen,</hi> with a great Fleet had croſs'd the Streights into <hi>Spain</hi> and had ſate down with his Army before <hi>Toledo,</hi> he publiſh'd a Bull inciting all thoſe that could bear Arms to oppoſe this torrent; whereupon num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>French</hi> men got together in order to aſſiſt the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they were not welcome to them, they return'd home; ſo that <hi>Hilminoline</hi> in a ſhort time over-run all <hi>Spain</hi> after a hoſtile manner, and came as far as <hi>Arles</hi> and <hi>Avignon,</hi> filling all places where he came with ſpoil and ſlaughter. This Calamity rouſed the four Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> that is, of <hi>Caſtile, Aragon, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> ſo that, joyning their forces together, they ſet upon the <hi>Saracens</hi> and gave them a total rout, leaving nothing to 'em of what they had but onely <hi>Granado.</hi> At this time ſprung up a Hereſie at <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> which by <hi>Innocent</hi>'s means, the bleſſed <hi>Dominic,</hi> (who was afterwards made a Saint) repreſs'd, with the aid of <hi>Simon Montfort</hi>; for it had gone ſo far, that he had need of the help of the Arm of Fleſh as well as of Arguments and ſpiritual Weapons. Mean time <hi>Otho</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Romans</hi> was every where worſted by <hi>Philip,</hi> and at laſt beſieg'd by him in the City of <hi>Cologn,</hi> where he making in Perſon a ſucceſsleſs Sally, the Citizens ſhut him out and ſurrendred to <hi>Philip,</hi> who yet did not long out-live the Action, being ſoon after trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly made away by the Count <hi>Palatine.</hi> Upon his death, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors choſe the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> Emperour, nam'd <hi>Otho</hi> V. who the next year was crown'd by <hi>Innocent</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> now being very powerful at Sea, and the State having greater matters in hand, private Men had leave to make themſelves Maſters of what Iſlands they pleaſed, provided they continued their Allegiance to the Government, upon which many Citizens entred upon ſeveral Iſles in the <hi>Ionian</hi> and <hi>Aegaean</hi> Seas, and at the publick charge were ſeiz'd <hi>Corfu, Modone</hi> and <hi>Corone. Otho</hi> having, as is aforeſaid, receiv'd the Imperial Crown of the Pope, againſt all juſtice and right, poſſeſſes himſelf of <hi>Montefiaſcone, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicofano,</hi> and ſeveral other Towns belonging to the Church, and then marches into the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> deſigning to take that Kingdom from <hi>Frederic</hi> II. who was young and as yet under Guardians; which ſo angred the Pope, that having firſt admoniſh'd him without any effect he excommunicated him at laſt and depriv'd him of his Imperial Title; and the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> with the Arch biſhops of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> by the perſuaſion of the Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and Landgrave of <hi>Turingia,</hi> chuſe <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> then in the twentieth year of his age, Emperour in his ſtead. <hi>Otho</hi> hereupon returns into <hi>Germany,</hi> to take care of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Eſtate, by which means <hi>Innocent</hi> had an opportunity to his mind to recover whatſoever he had taken from the Church. Thoſe of <hi>Candy</hi> now rebelling againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they were by force of Arms reduc'd <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1214. and brought into the conſtitution of a Colony, many Citizens being ſent to live among 'em and to obſerve 'em. At this time <hi>Frederic</hi> II. came to <hi>Rome</hi> to receive the Imperial Diadem, but could not prevail with him to beſtow it upon him, ſo he return'd into <hi>Germany</hi> and there was by the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> Crown'd King of <hi>Germany,</hi> and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50681:147"/>
then made an Alliance and League with the King of <hi>France</hi>; which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo much to the ſtrength of that King, that he invaded the Realm of <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> with ſuch ſucceſs, that <hi>John</hi> was fain to make uſe of Divine aids as well as humane force, to reſiſt him, by making his Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> tributary to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the payment of one hundred Marks yearly, which for ſome years after was perform'd. <hi>Frederic</hi> now in purſuit of <hi>Otho,</hi> who had been totally defeated by the King of <hi>France,</hi> takes in <hi>Aquiſgrane,</hi> and there by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity receiv'd from Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> he ſets up the Standard of the Holy Croſs, promiſing ſpeedily to march to the aſſiſtance of the Chriſtians againſt the <hi>Saracens</hi> in <hi>Aſia:</hi> beſide that he might ſhew with what a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind he had receiv'd ſo many benefits of the Holy Sea, he gave the Country of <hi>Fondi</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and what had before been given and afterward uſurp'd from it, he reſtor'd. But the Pope taking notice of the increaſe of the <hi>Saracens</hi> Power in <hi>Aſia,</hi> call'd a full Council in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> where were preſent the Patriarchs of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> ſeventy Arch-biſhops, four hundred Biſhops, twelve Abbats, eight hundred Priors of Convents, and the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, with thoſe of the Kings of <hi>Jeruſalem, France, Spain, England</hi> and <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Many things here came under debate, but nothing could be determin'd, becauſe the <hi>Piſans</hi> and <hi>Genoeſes</hi> were then at War by Sea, as thoſe of <hi>Lombardy</hi> were among themſelves at Land. The Pope therefore took a journey thitherward to compoſe their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, but died in the way at <hi>Perugia,</hi> when he had been Pope eighteen years ſeven months and ſixteen days. He was a Man moſt exact in his life, a proof of which is, that none of his Acts which approv'd or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull'd any thing, were by any of his Succeſſors revers'd. He decreed many things for the reformation of manners both in Clergy and Laity; and wrote Books concerning the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm, and the unhappineſs of Mans condition, beſide that he was wont to make Sermons upon remarkable occaſions and ſolemn days. He diſallow'd a Book written by Abbat <hi>Joachim,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd ſome Heterodox Opinions; and condemn'd the Errors of <hi>Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus</hi> a Heretic, that with ſome of his followers was burnt at <hi>Paris,</hi> who among other falſe Notions maintain'd, that thoſe Idea's which are in the divine Mind were created and did create others, whereas according to S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> there is nothing in the Mind of God but what is Eternal and unchangeable; beſide he ſaid, that to one who was in a ſtate of Grace no Sin is charged. Great ſatisfaction this Pope took in obſerving the Virtue and Learning of S. <hi>Dominic,</hi> who was Founder of the Order of Preaching Friers, and of S. <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Aſſiſi,</hi> who was Author of the Order of <hi>Friers Minors.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, that in his time liv'd <hi>Gratian</hi> who compil'd the Decrees, and <hi>Papias</hi> the <hi>Lombard,</hi> who collected a <hi>Latin</hi> Alphabetical Dictionary; and indeed of <hi>Papias</hi> we have no reaſon to doubt, but for <hi>Gratian,</hi> ſome Authors place him in the times of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> III. Now leſt you ſhould think that <hi>Innocent</hi> in ſo long a Popedom neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works of Piety, I muſt tell you that at his charge the Hoſpital of the Holy Ghoſt was built and endow'd with ſo fair an Income as it is, for the relief of Pilgrims and ſick People, and for the Education of Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Children and Foundlings. He adorn'd S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Altar with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic Work, as the repreſentation of him and his Cipher in the Arch do
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:50681:148"/>
teſtifie. Moreover, he gave to each Church in <hi>Rome</hi> a Pound weight in Silver to make Chalices for Divine Service, and he repair'd the Church of S. <hi>Sixtus</hi> then almoſt falling with age. The Enemies of his good Name indeed ſay that he did this, only for fear Men ſhould ſay that he laid out all his Mony in building of the <hi>Torre de Conti,</hi> which he erected for the honour of his Family. However that be, 'tis certain he ſhew'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in all the parts of his life an excellent Man and one worthy to be reckon'd among the beſt Popes.</p>

This City was once call'd <hi>Aeliopolis</hi> from <hi>Aelius Pertinax,</hi> who environ'd it with a trebble Wall, and deriving a little ſtream of the <hi>Nile</hi> about it made it ſtand in an Iſland. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs hereof were large and full of Merchandize, which the Chriſtian Soldiers plunder'd; but ſoon after upon a Weſt-wind the <hi>Nile</hi> roſe ſo high, that their Proviſions were ſpoil'd, and they began to be in great want of neceſſaries; eſpecially becauſe the <hi>Soldan</hi> who was encamp'd not far off, had beſet all the paſſages to hinder any ſupplies coming to 'em. The Chriſtians under this difficulty march their Army againſt the <hi>Soldan,</hi> who in great fear ſtreight leaves his Camp ſtor'd with plenty of all things and retreats, leaving them free to beſiege the Town which he at firſt came to relieve. <hi>Cordirius</hi> alſo Son to the great <hi>Soldan,</hi> deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of being able to defend <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> if the Chriſtians took <hi>Damiata,</hi> broke down the Walls of the City and left nothing ſtanding but the Tower of <hi>David</hi> and the Temple of God; only he did not violate the Holy Sepulcre, mov'd (as we may ſuppoſe) by the intreaties of the Chriſtians that inhabited thoſe places. While our men attack'd <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata,</hi> the <hi>Soldan</hi> returns with a much greater Army and pitches his Camp between <hi>Cairo</hi> and <hi>Damiata</hi>; from which he could not be provok'd to Battel by either the challenges or reproaches of our Men; which ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd the <hi>French,</hi> that without any Order they ſet upon him and receiv'd great loſs. Notwithſtanding all this, the Siege was ſtill puſh'd on, till after fifteen months lying before it it was taken by the Chriſtians and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:50681:148"/>
ſack'd: ſo that the Soldiery was wonderfully enrich'd with the ſpoil. In the mean time <hi>Honorius</hi> had at <hi>Rome</hi> confirm'd the Order of S. <hi>Dominic</hi> upon his requeſt, and had Anathematiz'd <hi>Frederic</hi> II. becauſe (after his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Conſtantia</hi> was dead, who was wont to reſtrain him within his duty) he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and without right or reaſon laid waſt the Pope's Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. Theſe differences between the Pope and the Emperour being diſcover'd to the <hi>Soldan,</hi> mov'd him to take the opportunity, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he raiſes a greater Army than ever he had before, thinking the Chriſtians would not now ſhew their heads; but Cardinal <hi>John Colonna</hi> rouſed them with his perſuaſions, ſo that they took up Arms and went to meet the Enemy at the <hi>Nile:</hi> where when they were come, the <hi>Soldan</hi> feign'd himſelf afraid to cope with 'em, putting it off till the time of the Increaſe of <hi>Nile,</hi> which follow'd a little while after; and the Cataracts of that River opened and ſo overflow'd the whole Country, that it was in no place leſs than a Cubit in depth. This ſo terrified the Chriſtians, that they were glad to accept of Peace upon condition, that <hi>Damiata</hi> ſhould be re deliver'd to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the Priſoners on both ſides be diſcharg'd, and the piece of the Holy Croſs then in the hands of thoſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſhould be reſtor'd to the Chriſtians, and they ſuffer'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire quietly to <hi>Acon</hi> and <hi>Tyre.</hi> Thus was <hi>Damiata</hi> which was begun to be inhabited by the Chriſtians upon the Feaſt of the Purification of the Bleſſed Virgin, deliver'd up according to the Articles, on the Birth-day of the ſame, <hi>An.

While theſe things were acting by the Pope, another Commander of the Emperours by ſiding with a Faction ſeizes <hi>Fuligno,</hi> but was quickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the Power of ſome good Men who ſtood up for the holy Church. By this time <hi>Frederic</hi> was got to <hi>Acon,</hi> and from thence ſolicited the Pope earneſtly by Letters and Meſſengers, to be abſolv'd by him, and promiſed if he could obtain his requeſt, to be ever after his moſt humble Servant: but the Pope being well aware of the crafty temper of the Man, not onely warns the Chriſtian Soldiers to have a care of him as of one that was always plotting miſchief; but having rais'd an Army he ſends it under <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> againſt <hi>Rainaldo,</hi> who then was haraſſing the <hi>Marca di Ancona</hi> and fill'd all places with rapine and deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation; and with other Forces under Cardinal <hi>Colonna</hi> he drove the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Lieutenant, with his mercenary <hi>Saracens,</hi> out of S. <hi>Germans,</hi> and had all the places from thence to <hi>Capua</hi> deliver'd to him by ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a ſhort time. Theſe ſucceſſes of the Pope ſo affrighted thoſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria</hi> and <hi>Marca di Ancona</hi> who had ſerv'd under <hi>Frederic,</hi> that they deſerted whatſoever they held and retreated into <hi>Naples.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Frederic</hi> was return'd from <hi>Aſia</hi> to <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> and being now very deſirous of Peace, offer'd his requeſts to the Pope, that he would pleaſe to take him into favour, to acknowledg him Emperour, and a true Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datary of the Church for the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily.</hi> Which he at laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, but not till he had paid down one hundred and twenty thouſand ounces of Gold for the uſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make good the damages he had done it; and theſe Conditions he was forc'd to come to <hi>Anagni</hi> and there to implore of his Holineſs. While <hi>Gregory</hi> (as became a faithful Shepherd) was thus careful on all hands and was gone to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugia,</hi> to ſettle matters in that City then much diſordered by ſome baniſh'd perſons who were newly return'd, there aroſe a greater Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Hereſie at <hi>Rome</hi> than had been known before: for <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Hannibali</hi> joyning with ſome Prieſts, was made uſe of to head the People of <hi>Rome</hi> in a Conſpiracy they carried on againſt the Church of God; but the divine Vengeance ſpeedily put a ſtop to their wicked deſigns; for the River <hi>Tiber</hi> riſing over his Banks, did them much miſchief, and this was accompanied with ſo devouring a Plague, that hardly one man in ten was left alive. The Pope coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> behav'd himſelf with wonderful Clemency, and forgave the People of <hi>Rome</hi> their fault, onely putting <hi>Hannibal</hi> out of the Senate and convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prieſts of their Hereſie, he brought them to recant their Error
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50681:150"/>
and to profeſs as true Chriſtians ought to do: then turning his thoughts to adorning the City, he cauſed the old Common-ſhores to be cleanſed and repair'd, and new ones to be made, at the ſame time yet conſulting not onely the Ornament but the healthineſs of the place. Then leaving <hi>Rome,</hi> for his healths ſake, at <hi>Riete</hi> (as ſome will have it) he canoniz'd S. <hi>Dominic</hi> who founded the Order of Friers <hi>Predicants,</hi> and at <hi>Spoleto,</hi> he did the ſame by S. <hi>Antony,</hi> who was born at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> but died at <hi>Padua,</hi> and was the ſecond after S. <hi>Francis,</hi> head of the Order of <hi>Minors</hi>; hence he return'd to <hi>Anagni,</hi> and fortified the circumjacent Town, not a little apprehending the factious humour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe chief Senator, after the antient manner, had propoſed a Law to be made and the People had paſs'd it, that ſhould oblige all the Towns lying about <hi>Rome</hi> to pay a certain Tax to themſelves; the Pope hereupon fearleſly takes his journey to <hi>Rome</hi> (though the Cardinals diſſuaded him) mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to endeavour by admonition or correction to bring the <hi>Romans</hi> off from theſe inſolences: but when he found it ſignified nothing what he did, he departed to <hi>Riete,</hi> whither alſo came the Emperour <hi>Frederic</hi>; and they having diſcourſe about the preſent ſtate of Affairs, they both came to this reſolution, that they would join their forces together and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly march againſt the <hi>Romans.</hi> But at this time (as he had always uſed to do) <hi>Frederic</hi> put a trick upon the Pope; for returning himſelf into <hi>Germany,</hi> he left Order with his Men, that they ſhould in all jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures act as the <hi>Romans</hi> would have 'em. The Pope was much mov'd at this treachery of his, and propoſed a good Reward to any <hi>German</hi> Soldiers who would leave their Leaders and ſerve under him, whereupon ſo great multitudes came over to his ſide, that the <hi>Romans</hi> dar'd not any where ſhew themſelves in open field againſt the Army of the Church. <hi>Gregory</hi> having by this means recover'd the Patrimony of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the <hi>Contrada de' Sabini,</hi> he ſlighted the Ambaſſadours of the <hi>Soldan,</hi> who came humbly to ſue for Peace, and ſent Friers of the Orders of S. <hi>Francis</hi> and S. <hi>Dominic</hi> throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> by their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſtir up the Chriſtians to the War againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> by whoſe means greater numbers were got together, than ever were before; and in the mean time that it was under debate who ſhould command this great Army, the Pope canoniz'd <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> a moſt holy Woman and famous for the Miracles wrought by her. At length <hi>Theobald</hi> King of <hi>Navarre, Almeric Montfort, Henry</hi> Count of <hi>Bari</hi> and <hi>Campania</hi> with the Chriſtian forces paſſing through <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> arriv'd firſt at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where croſſing the <hi>Boſporus,</hi> they came at laſt to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> laying the Country waſte far and near. But they were not long after ſet upon by a vaſt Army of the Enemy, and compell'd to retreat defending themſelves from their purſuers for two days, and there loſt all their beſt Men. Thus in a ſhort time came this Expedition to nothing, which had coſt ſo much induſtry to be brought about, merely through the unskilfulneſs of the Commanders. The Pope was extremely troubled at this Calamity, and reſolv'd to return to <hi>Rome</hi> (at the earneſt inſtance of the Citizens) there to put up Prayers and ſupplications to appeaſe the Divine Wrath, which the ſins of Mankind had provok'd; but his intention was fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by <hi>Peter Frangipani,</hi> who being of the Imperial Faction, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him; ſo he left <hi>Perugia</hi> and went to <hi>Viterbo,</hi> to meet the Emperour

with an Army, who (as intelligence was brought him) had already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and without any juſt cauſe waſted the Territories of the Confederate Cities, and was about to lay Siege to ſome of 'em whoſe Forces were almoſt broken already, having receiv'd one miſchief upon the neck of another from <hi>Ezelino</hi> who then Lorded it over <hi>Padua.</hi> This <hi>Ezelino</hi> ſurnam'd the <hi>Roman,</hi> was Grand-ſon to a <hi>German</hi> Commander (who under <hi>Otho</hi> III. led an Army of his Countrymen into <hi>Italy,</hi>) and now having a body of Men which he receiv'd of <hi>Frederic,</hi> under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, procur'd to himſelf a great Dominion in the Country of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> bringing under his juriſdiction <hi>Treviſo, Padoua, Vincenza, Verona</hi> and <hi>Breſcia</hi>; and <hi>Frederic</hi> not ſhewing any regard to the ſtipulations and agreements which had theretofore been ratified between his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and them, makes War upon the <hi>Milaneſes</hi> and the aſſociated Cities, and in a great Battel fought between 'em at a place call'd <hi>Nova Corte</hi> he overcame 'em with great loſs on their ſide; which put the Pope ſo much out of hopes of ſucceſs, that upon hearing this ill news of the misfortune of his Friends and Allies, he began to think of retiring to <hi>Rome,</hi> though his coming thither was oppoſed by one <hi>John Cincio,</hi> a potent Citizen and Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whoſe intolerable arrogance yet was ſo curb'd by <hi>James Capocio</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, that the Pope was received into <hi>Rome</hi> with great ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor &amp; magnificence. This was that <hi>James,</hi> whoſe name is yet to be ſeen and read in the little Chappel of Moſaic Work which was built at his charge in the Church of S. <hi>Mary Maggiore,</hi> in which alſo was buried <hi>Peter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocio</hi> who was a Cardinal of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and while he liv'd a bitter Enemy of this Schiſmatical Emperour <hi>Frederic</hi>: at whoſe expence the Hoſpital of S. <hi>Anthony</hi> not far from the aforeſaid Church and the College for Scholars at <hi>Perugia</hi> (now call'd <hi>la Sapientia</hi>) was alſo erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Gregory</hi> having quieted the minds of Men in the City, again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt <hi>Frederic</hi> and declares him to have forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his right to the Empire and deprives him of it; then he ſends for the Ambaſſadours of the States of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> (between whom there was ſo great a quarrel as it was fear'd a War would enſue) to mediate their differences, which he did ſo effectually as that he procur'd an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between 'em to a Peace, upon condition, that without mutual conſent neither of the two States ſhould make Peace with the Emperor of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi>; that they ſhould be Enemies to the Enemies of each other and join their Forces upon every occaſion for the common defence; and this Treaty to be in force and complied withal for nine years by them both, under pain of Excommunication to be denounc'd by the Pope upon the Infractor. About this time died <hi>Baldwin</hi> who upon the Death of <hi>John</hi> had ſucceeded to the Empire of <hi>Greece,</hi> and made ſhift to hold it for two years; but with ſo great difficulty by reaſon of his poor Treaſury, that he could hardly defend himſelf from his Enemies, being forc'd to deliver his Son for a Pledg to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Merchants for Money that he had borrow'd of 'em, and to make Money of the Lead that belong'd to the Churches; beſide he ſold to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were wealthy and able to purchaſe 'em, the Spear with which our Saviour Chriſt's Body was pierc'd and the Sponge which was reach'd to him to drink out of <hi>Frederic</hi> had a great ſpight at theſe <hi>Venetians,</hi> becauſe they were on the Pope's ſide, and drove them into their Mariſhes (where their City ſtands) for ſecurity and did them great damage; but in the mean while happened a general revolt of the Cities of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> by the Procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:50681:151"/>
and inſtigation of <hi>Gregory Monte-longo,</hi> who was Legat at <hi>Bononia,</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which had revolted before from the Pope to the Emperour was retaken by them, though <hi>Salinguerra</hi> a valiant Commander was in it and made a brave defence. As ſoon as it was taken, it was put into the hands of <hi>Azo</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Eſte,</hi> who was a conſiderable Perſon in this Enterprize, to be govern'd by him in the name of the Church, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1240. This ſo alarm'd the Emperour who was then at <hi>Piſa,</hi> that being under great uncertainty whom to look upon as Friends to himſelf or Wellwiſhers to the Pope, he divided firſt the Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> into two Factions, giving the name of <hi>Guelphs</hi> to thoſe who were for the Pope's Intereſt, and that of <hi>Gibellines</hi> to them that were for the Imperial. Theſe moſt pernicious names of diſtinction, invented ſurely for the miſchief of mankind, were firſt made uſe of at <hi>Piſtoia,</hi> where when the Magiſtrates expell'd the <hi>Panzatichi,</hi> who were <hi>Gibellines,</hi> out of the City, there chanc'd to be two Brothers <hi>Germans,</hi> the one of which whoſe name was <hi>Guelph,</hi> was for the Pope; the other for the Emperour and his name was <hi>Gibel</hi>; from which theſe two Parties were diſcriminated by thoſe different appellations. On the other ſide thoſe of <hi>Arezzo</hi> and <hi>Sienna</hi> drive out the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> whoſe example being follow'd by many other Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> gave occaſion and riſe to a worſe than Civil War. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cities after this revolted from the Pope as well in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria</hi> as in <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi> and particularly the Citizens of <hi>Viterbo</hi> threw off their obedience. The <hi>Romans</hi> alſo would fain have been doing the ſame thing, but that the Pope carrying the heads of the Apoſtles SS. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> through the City in Proceſſion, moved the People to commiſerate the State of the Church, and then making a moſt excellent Oration in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, he had the power and good fortune by it to perſuade even the Seditious (who were ready to mutiny) to take his part and to liſt themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the holy Croſs for the defence of the Church of God. Theſe, when ſome time after <hi>Frederic</hi> came in hoſtile manner before the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> gave him a repulſe, which ſo enrag'd him that whatſoever Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners he had taken he put to death with divers tortures, and retir'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Beneventum,</hi> which City he took by force, ſack'd, and diſmantled it. Then returning by the <hi>Via Latina</hi> with his heart full of fury to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the City, by the way he plunder'd the Monaſtery of <hi>Monte-Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſino</hi> and turn'd out the Monks; he deſtroy'd alſo with fire and ſword the City of <hi>Sora,</hi> formerly belonging to the <hi>Samnites,</hi> ſituate at the head of the River <hi>Garigliano,</hi> and pillag'd any thing that belong'd to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers wherever he could meet with it. He was ſo great a Lover of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> that he made uſe of them rather than any other People in his Wars, made Magiſtrates of them, and gave them a City for themſelves, which is call'd to this day <hi>Nocera di Pagani.</hi> He threaten'd the Brother of the King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> becauſe he was come as far as <hi>Palermo</hi> to receive the Sacrament of Baptiſm. By a ſudden Onſet he alſo made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which appertain'd to the Church.

Which ſo griev'd the good Pope, that he liv'd not long after, dying when he had been Pope fourteen

He complied, and arriv'd at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> but it was at ſo unſeaſonable a time of the year, that he was forc'd to take up his Winter quarters there; but as ſoon as Spring came on, he ſail'd to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata,</hi> where he got the better of the <hi>Soldan</hi>'s Navy, and defeated his Land-forces who would have hindred his coming on Shore, where he pitch'd his Camp for ſo long as till the reſt of his Troops could arrive from <hi>Italy.</hi> But theſe were very much retarded by the fury of <hi>Frederic,</hi> who weaning himſelf after a while from the pleaſures in which he had been immers'd, takes up his Arms again and fills the whole Country with confuſion, and compells ſeveral Cities in which were many factious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to throw off their ſubjection to the Pope; the chief of which were the Inhabitants of <hi>Forli, Arimino, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> and all the <hi>Marca di Ancona:</hi> In <hi>

Some write that 'twas at this time that <hi>Frederic</hi> paſſing into <hi>Sicily,</hi> died at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lermo</hi>; while others affirm that he was taken deſperately ſick in <hi>Puglia,</hi> and when he began to recover, he was ſmother'd to death with a Pillow by one <hi>Manfred,</hi> who was his natural Son, begotten upon a Noble-Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man his Concubine. Howſoever this was, 'tis certain that ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death he had made <hi>Manfred</hi> Prince of <hi>Tarento,</hi> and had beſtow'd upon him, beſide that Principality, many other Towns and Territories.</p>
               <p>He left <hi>Conrade</hi> (whom he had by his Wife <hi>Jole</hi> Daughter to <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) Heir of all his Eſtates, but he was afterwards taken off by Poiſon, as was manifeſt, by the means of <hi>Manfred</hi>; having before ſeiz'd upon <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Aquino,</hi> and ſack'd them, much againſt the mind
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50681:153"/>
of the Pope, who vigorouſly oppoſed theſe proceedings, though in vain, in order to procure the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> that he might have liberty to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport the <hi>Italian</hi> Soldiers to recruit the Army of King <hi>Lewis</hi> then lying before <hi>Damiata.</hi> But <hi>Damiata</hi> was now taken, and <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers</hi> coming with freſh ſupplies from <hi>France,</hi> he marches from thence with his Army towards the City of <hi>Pharamia,</hi> whither the <hi>Soldan,</hi> apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſign, was already come with great Forces. There happen'd to be a River betwixt the two Armies, by reaſon whereof they could not join Battel, but they had frequent light Skirmiſhes, (both Generals keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves within their Camps) in one of which <hi>Robert</hi> raſhly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing too far, was taken Priſoner by the Enemy. By this time <hi>Innocent</hi> had almoſt extinguiſh'd thoſe flames of War with which <hi>Italy</hi> had ſo long been conſum'd, and intended to have return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> having firſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniz'd <hi>Edmund</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; but when he came to <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> he thought good to decline his journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> underſtanding the Senate there arrogated to themſelves more Power than ſtood with the dignity of the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; and there he canoniz'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll'd among the holy Martyrs <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Verona</hi> a preaching Frier, who had been murthered by ſome Hereticks between <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Como</hi>; and the ſame honour he gave to S. <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cracow,</hi> who in his life-time was very famous for working Miracles. Hence he was invited by the Noblemen of the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and immediately departed for <hi>Naples,</hi> then newly repair'd, where he died and was buried in S. <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>'s Church, when he had been Pope fourteen years ſix months twelve days, juſt in the nick of time when he had hopes to have brought into his poſſeſſion all that Kingdom. It was by the Decree of this excellent Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> that the Octave of the Nativity of the Bleſſed Virgin was commanded to be obſerv'd yearly in the Church of God as a Feſtival. He with good advice, fill'd up the places in the College of Cardinals, which had long been vacant, with very worthy perſonages, and ordain'd that when they rode abroad they ſhould always wear a red Hat, for an honourable diſtinction of the degree they held. Moreover this learned Pope, though raiſed to the higheſt dignity in the Church, compil'd and publiſh'd ſeveral things; for he compoſed the <hi>Apparatus</hi> [or Gloſſes] to the Decretals, which are of great uſe to the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain many nice diſquiſitions, which render the Text wonderfully plain: and he put forth another upon the Councils, which <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> in his <hi>Summa</hi> calls the <hi>Authenticks.</hi> He wrote alſo a Book concerning the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Emperour and the Authority of the Pope, in anſwer to one <hi>Peter</hi> ſurnam'd <hi>Vinea,</hi> who aſſerted, that the Empire and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and thing thereunto belonging were abſolutely ſubject to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; to which Book <hi>Innocent</hi> afterwards gave the Title of his <hi>Apologe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi> He was extremely delighted with the converſation of learned Men, whom alſo he remembred to prefer to dignities in the Church; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly one <hi>Hugo,</hi> who wrote Comments and Concordances upon the holy Bible, a Perſon famous for his learning and good life, he advanc'd to be Cardinal of S. <hi>Sabina,</hi> which great promotion yet did not make him leave his former courſe of life, being a Frier of the Order of S. <hi>Dominic.</hi> In this Pope's Reign and by his Order, <hi>Alexander</hi> of the Order of Friers <hi>Minors,</hi> who was well in years when he took upon him a religious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, wrote a very copious ſum of Theology: by the procurement alſo of

The Pope yet ceaſed not to perſecute the tyrannical Lords, whereſoever they were, for when <hi>Ecelino,</hi> as was ſaid, had ſeiz'd into his hands almoſt all the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territories and had laid Siege to <hi>Mantua,</hi> he immediately ſent away <hi>Philip Fontaneſe,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Ravenna</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> where having pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd the <hi>Cruſado,</hi> he got together a good Army, and with it drove <hi>Anſelm, Ecelino</hi>'s Nephew, out of <hi>Padua</hi>; upon news whereof <hi>Ecelino</hi> raiſes his Siege from before <hi>Mantua</hi> and marches in great haſte to <hi>Verona,</hi> but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding he could have no hopes of recovering <hi>Padua,</hi> he put to death with divers torments, all the <hi>Paduans</hi> he had in his Camp, to the number of twelve thouſand.

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> having taken off theſe tyrannizing Lords and put an end to ſo many great confuſions, ſet his mind upon renewing the War in <hi>Aſia</hi>; but by reaſon of a quarrel which happen'd between the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> and <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> this pious and neceſſary Expedition was laid aſide. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians then inhabited <hi>Ptolemais</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi> two opulent and wealthy Cities; which were eſpecially peopled with <hi>Genoeſe, Piſan</hi> and <hi>Venetian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who now for ſixty four years had engroſs'd almoſt all the Trade both from Eaſt and Weſt. Theſe Merchants had their ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, their ſeveral Streets and Landing-places, and nothing was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> but the Churches; when a contention aroſe between 'em about the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Saba,</hi> which each City claim'd to itſelf alone. The Pope would fain have compoſed the difference, and ſent his Letters to both, willing that the Monaſtery ſhould be equal free to both Nations; but the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> having notice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand how the Pope intended to determine in the Caſe, by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Philip Montfort,</hi> Prefect of the City, they excluded the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> poſſeſs'd themſelves of the Monaſtery and fortified it. The <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> hereupon unanimouſly leave the City, and making League with <hi>Manfred</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> raiſe Forces againſt the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> and ſetting upon their Fleet, conſiſting of two Gallies and twenty three great Ships then in the Port of <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> they burn 'em and following their blow at the ſame time make themſelves Maſters of the Monaſtery of S. <hi>Saba,</hi> which they demoliſh'd. The <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> rather enrag'd than terrified at this diſaſter, fit out another Fleet, to encounter the <hi>Venetians</hi> at <hi>Tyre,</hi> but they induſtriouſly avoiding a Battel, ſail towards the <hi>Euxine,</hi> and take <hi>Selymbria</hi> from the <hi>Saracens</hi> and plunder it; after which both Nations recruiting their Forces, they ſteer for <hi>Tyre,</hi> the common Seat of War. The Pope fearful of the fatal conſequences of this Contention, ſends for the Ambaſſadours of both Countries, and makes himſelf a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Peace; which was welnigh agreed to, when news comes that the <hi>Venetians</hi> with their Allies, the <hi>Piſans,</hi> had between <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Ptolemais</hi> routed the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> taking and ſinking twenty five of their Ships; that thereupon the Victors were retreated to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> and the vanquiſh'd were ſled to <hi>Tyre</hi>; that all the Edifices of the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> at <hi>Ptolemais</hi> were pull'd down, all their Merchandizes ſeiz'd as ſpoil, and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of that Nation expell'd the place. This havock made by the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſo highly diſpleaſed the Pope, that he would not admit their Ambaſſadour to Audience till they had ſet free all the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Priſoners they had taken. Neither did this Calamity come alone to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Pope's care, for <hi>Baldwin</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> (during whoſe proſperity, there ſeem'd yet to be ſome hopes left of recovering the holy Land) was about to quit that City: for <hi>Michael Palaeologus,</hi> who by the laſt Will of <hi>Theodore Laſcari,</hi> was left Guardian to his two Sons did the <hi>Latins</hi> all the miſchief that lay in his power, driving out of <hi>Achaia William</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and teizing <hi>Baldwin</hi> with Seditions at home and open War abroad; who afterward going toward the <hi>Euxine</hi> Shore, in order to ſecure it from the Enemy, the Citizens of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> in the mean time at midnight let <hi>Michael Palaeologus</hi> into the City; upon news whereof <hi>Baldwin</hi> and the Patriarch <hi>Pantaleo</hi> retire from <hi>Pontus</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> and lay by all thoughts of War. <hi>Palaeologus</hi> having thus rid himſelf of his Competitor and Enemy, murders his

two Pupils, and aſſumes the Empire, which after having been poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Latins</hi> forty eight years now was transferred to the <hi>Greeks.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Octavian</hi> Cardinal <hi>

The Sea was then vacant three months and four days. The life of this Pope is certainly much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by all Writers, he being ſaid to have been bountiful and kind to all, but eſpecially to the poor Religious; to whom the great love he bore caus'd him to comdemn by a perpetual Edict ſome Books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>William de ſancto Amore,</hi> againſt that ſort of Poverty, wherein the wicked Fellow aſſerted that thoſe who took upon them religious Habits to live by the Alms of other Men were not capable of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He alſo publickly burnt another abominable Book, in which the Author affirm'd that a State of Grace was not to be obtain'd by the Law of the Goſpel, but by the Law of the Spirit; which Opinion, he ſaid, was taken out of the Writings of Abbat <hi>Joachim.</hi> This Book was call'd by thoſe of that Sect, the <hi>Eternal Goſpel.</hi> It was <hi>Alexander</hi>'s cuſtom, when he got leiſure from publick Affairs to buſie himſelf about ſomewhat that ſavour'd of Learning, for he compil'd Decretal Epiſtles, and gave ſuch countenance to learned Men, that he promoted ſeveral of them to Cardinalates, particularly, <hi>Henry</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> a good Divine and an excellent Lawyer. He was alſo very liberal and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent to <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> a Canoniſt of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> who wrote much upon the Decretals; by which and by his extraordinary abilities and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he got great renown. By this means moreover the vaulted Church near that of S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> which had in old time been dedicated to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> was made capable of Divine Worſhip; and the Inſcription in the Porch of the Church of S. <hi>Conſtance</hi> ſhews that the Altar there was conſecrated by him.</p>

And thus went matters in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> the Pope ſtill earneſtly endeavouring a Peace. At <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> attempted to dethrone <hi>Palaeologus</hi> and had done it, but for his Friends and Aſſociates the <hi>Genoeſe</hi>; this gave him the greater Power ſo that having taken <hi>Malvaſia,</hi> he eaſily made reſiſtance againſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Prince of <hi>Achaia.</hi> The Pope was now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon ſending a Legate to procure a Peace betwixt the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> when <hi>Manfredus</hi> with a new body of <hi>Saracens</hi> ſeizes <hi>la Marca,</hi> the Inhabitants being before inclin'd to a Rebellion. The Pope therefore ſends the ſame Legate to <hi>France,</hi> with order to make uſe of all manner of Promiſes and Intreaties to perſuade thoſe <hi>French</hi> who had taken upon them the Croiſado, (who had been inform'd of the thing before-hand) to haſten their march thither; they preſently under the conduct of <hi>Guy</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerre</hi> deſcend into <hi>Italy,</hi> and vanquiſhing <hi>Pallavicino</hi> at <hi>Breſcia,</hi> without meeting any reſiſtance, they come to <hi>Viterbo:</hi> from whence a little while after, having firſt receiv'd the Popes bleſſing, continuing their march through <hi>

This affront gave great offence to the <hi>Bononians,</hi> who ſeizing ſeveral <hi>Romans,</hi> proteſted they would never releaſe them, but upon the delivery of their <hi>Brancaleon</hi>; which ſo wrought upon the cautious <hi>Romans,</hi> that they not onely releaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

him, but reſtor'd him to his former dignity; ſetting up alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Court of men choſen out of every Ward in the City (whom they called <hi>Bandereſe</hi>) to whom they committed the Power of life and death. The Pope plainly found the reaſon of this inſolence of the <hi>Romans</hi> to be that they obſerv'd how <hi>Manfredus</hi> had plagu'd him and that he was not able to help himſelf. That he might therefore at laſt free the Church from the tyranny of theſe men, he ſent Legates to <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> to exhort him, that he would aſſoon as poſſible ſend his Couſin and Son-in-law <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Anjou</hi> with an Army into <hi>Italy</hi>; he intending upon the expulſion of <hi>Manfredus,</hi> to create him King of both <hi>Sicilies.</hi> And this no doubt he had done (ſo high were his reſentments of the Ingratitude of <hi>Manfredus</hi>) if ſickneſs had not taken him off from buſineſs. Which yet was brought to paſs, as is ſuppoſed, by the following Pope. To the times of this Pope is aſcribed <hi>Albertus</hi> a High <hi>German,</hi> of the Order of Friers Predicant, who for the vaſtneſs of his learning got the Surname of <hi>Magnus.</hi> He Commented upon all the Works of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and explain'd the Chriſtian Religion with great acuteneſs; beſide he wrought very accurately concerning the ſecrets of Nature; He alſo put forth a Book <hi>de Coaequaevis,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he endeavours to ſhew the little difference that is between Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and Natural Philoſophy. He expounded a great part of the Holy Bible, and illuſtrated the Goſpels and S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles with excellent Notes. He began alſo a Body of Divinity, but liv'd not to perfect it. He was a man ſo modeſt and ſo much given to Study, that he refuſed the Biſhoprick of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> becauſe it could not be manag'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trouble and force of Arms ſometimes, as the Biſhops of <hi>Germany</hi> are wont to do. He liv'd therefore in private at <hi>Cologn</hi> reading onely ſome publick Lectures. At length he died there in the eightieth year of his age, leaving behind him many Scholars for the good of Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, eſpecially <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who leaving his Countrey and his noble kinred (for he deriv'd his pedigree from the Counts of <hi>Apulia</hi>) and going to <hi>Cologn,</hi> he made ſuch progreſs in learning, that after a few years he was made Profeſſor at <hi>Paris</hi>; where he publiſhed four Books upon the Sentences, and wrote a Book againſt <hi>William de St. Amour</hi> a pernicious Fellow; Beſide he put forth two Books, one <hi>de qualitate &amp; eſſentiis,</hi> the other <hi>de principiis naturae.</hi> At laſt he was ſent for to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> but refuſing thoſe promotions that were offered him, he gave himſelf wholly to Reading and Writing. He ſet up a School at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at the deſire of <hi>

Therefore leſt <hi>Manfred</hi> ſhould hope to make uſe of any quarrels between <hi>Alphonſus</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> (to whom many people ſaid the Empire was juſtly due, though he could not challenge it) the Pope animated <hi>Charles</hi> againſt <hi>Manfred</hi> as one that ſtood in Contempt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. For <hi>Charles</hi>'s Army was already gotten over the <hi>Alpes</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and marching through <hi>Romagnia,</hi> had brought all the Soldiers of the <hi>Guelphs</hi> Party as far as <hi>Rome.</hi> From whence <hi>Charles</hi> removed, and took not onely <hi>Ceperane,</hi> having beaten out <hi>Manfred</hi>'s men, but poſted himſelf in a Foreſt near <hi>Caſſino,</hi> which <hi>Manfred</hi> himſelf had undertaken to defend: although his mind was ſoon alter'd, and he reſolv'd to march for <hi>Benevento,</hi> to expect the Enemy in plain and ſpacious places, becauſe his forces conſiſted moſt of Cavalry. Thither alſo did <hi>Charles</hi> move; and aſſoon as he had an opportunity to fight, did not decline it, though his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were very weary with travelling. Each of them encouraged their men to engage: But <hi>Charles</hi> coming to relieve a Troop of his Soldiers, that were like to be worſted, more eagerly than uſually (as in ſuch caſes Military Men will do) he was knock'd down from his Horſe, at which the Enemy was ſo tranſported, that <hi>Manfred</hi> fought careleſly out of rank and file<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was kill'd; which, when <hi>Charles</hi> appeared again
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:50681:157"/>
ſtraight turn'd the fortune of the Day. For many of his men that ran away were kill'd, and a great many others taken Priſoners. <hi>Charles</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtain'd ſo great a Victory removes to <hi>Benevento</hi> and marches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it upon a voluntary ſurrender of the Citizens. From thence he went to ſtorm <hi>Nocera de Pagani,</hi> where both the modern and the ancient <hi>Saracens</hi> lived, but ſent his <hi>Mareſchal</hi> into <hi>Tuſcany</hi> with five hundred Horſe, to reſtore the <hi>Guelphs</hi> that had been baniſhed, into their own Cities. He was no ſooner come thither but the <hi>Gibbelins</hi> departed on their own accord, and he without any diſturbance appointed a certain number of Officers at <hi>Florence,</hi> which the neighbouring Natives call the Heads of the <hi>Guelphian</hi> Faction. Thence he moved againſt the <hi>Sienneſes,</hi> and made all the <hi>Gibellins</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> but eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Piſa</hi> his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, becauſe he beſieged <hi>Poggibonci,</hi> which the <hi>Gibellines</hi> ſtoutly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. Now when <hi>Charles</hi> had reduced both Kingdoms, all but <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera de Pagani,</hi> he at laſt grants the <hi>Saracens</hi> a Peace, and let 'em live in <hi>Italy</hi> upon their own terms, as they thought good. But he himſelf with his Army upon the Popes invitation, went to <hi>Viterbo,</hi> where <hi>Henry,</hi> baniſh'd by his Brother, the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> was not long before arrived. Of whom when the Pope had heard <hi>Charles</hi>'s good Character, he was ſo pleaſed with it, that he preſented him with great things and made him a Senator of the City. After that <hi>Charles</hi> marched into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> to ſuppreſs the <hi>Gibellins,</hi> who deſired <hi>Corradin</hi> a young Man, Nephew to <hi>Conrad</hi> of <hi>Schwaben,</hi> to come into <hi>Italy</hi> and aſſiſt them againſt the <hi>Guelphs.</hi> And ſeeing that he could not take <hi>Poggi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonci</hi> by ſtorm, becauſe it was ſo well fortified both by Art and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he reſolved to ſtarve it into a Surrender. And by that means after a long Siege he took it; and then going againſt them of <hi>Piſa,</hi> he took a Town of theirs, called <hi>Mutrone,</hi> and gave it to the State of <hi>Luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Charles</hi> at that time was very likely to have done greater things, but that his friends called him haſtily home to his Kingdom by reaſon of ſome factious People that favour'd <hi>Corradin</hi>'s Party, but moſt of all upon account of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> whom he preſently ſhut up in the ſtrong <hi>Caſtles</hi> of <hi>Nocera de Pagani,</hi> that he might go the ſafer againſt <hi>Corradin,</hi> whom the men of <hi>Piſa</hi> endeavour'd to make their King, after they had not only laid waſte all the Countrey of <hi>Lucca,</hi> but conquer'd and kill'd <hi>Charles</hi>'s Mareſchal at <hi>Arezzo,</hi> by the aſſiſtance, chiefly, of <hi>Guido</hi> of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and all the <hi>Gibellin</hi> faction on that ſide the <hi>Alpes.</hi> They ſay, that as the Youth paſſed through the Countrey near <hi>Viterbo</hi> toward the Kingdom, the Pope, who pitied his condition, ſaid in a Prophetick manner, that <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radin</hi> himſelf was led as a Sacrifice to the ſlaughter. So then he went toward <hi>Rome,</hi> and was met at <hi>Ponte Molle</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Senator</hi> together with all the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſaluted him with loud acclamations by the name of <hi>Emperor</hi>; but whether out of fear or love, is not well known. At <hi>Rome</hi> he diſmiſſed <hi>Guido</hi> of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and went himſelf in all haſte with his Army toward the Kingdom; where when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood how <hi>Charles</hi> had taken poſſeſſion of <hi>Compagna di Roma,</hi> and the great Road that goes through it, he turn'd away to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains called <hi>Tagliacocii,</hi> toward <hi>Marſi.</hi> And there he encamp'd firſt of all near the Lake, being fortified with an old Conduit, and ruinated Houſes. <hi>Charles</hi> mov'd that way too, and pitch'd his Tents within ten furlongs of him at the entrance of an hollow Vale; where by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

of <hi>Alardus</hi> a <hi>Neapolitane,</hi> who had been an old Soldier in <hi>Germany,</hi> he immediately ſent away part of his Army under the command of his Marſhal who was diſguis'd like a King, with a deſign to provoke the Enemy. But he himſelf ſtaid the mean while on the other ſide the Hill with his beſt Soldiers in Ambuſcade to wait for a good occaſion of doing his buſineſs effectually. They fought full three whole hours without being able to ſay who ſhould have the better of it, till the Marſhal who behav'd himſelf very bravely, fell. At whoſe death the <hi>French</hi> began to give back, but the <hi>Germans</hi> were more brisk than ever, and purſu'd them to all places without any manner of Order. By this means <hi>Charles</hi> came upon 'em in a Confuſion, routed 'em and made 'em run for't, but kill'd a great many of 'em as they fled. <hi>Henry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator was taken Priſoner at <hi>Rieti</hi> whilſt he endeavour'd to eſcape; and <hi>Corradin</hi> being diſcover'd at the ſame time with the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> as he attempted to paſs the <hi>Tiber</hi> and go by Boat into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> was brought to <hi>Charles</hi> and put to death: as the Pope, we told you, had propheſied it would ſhortly happen. <hi>Charles</hi> therefore in the year 1268, after ſo great a Victory, and having made himſelf abſolute in the Kingdom, went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where for ſome time he acted as a Senator by the Popes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and ſent his Marſhal into <hi>Tuſcany:</hi> by whoſe pains and care a Peace was made between the <hi>Sieneſes</hi> and the <hi>Florentines.</hi> But when <hi>Clement</hi> was dead, in the third year of his Popedom, and twenty firſt day, and buried at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> there was ſuch a Difference preſently not onely between the People of <hi>Italy,</hi> whom the godly Pope whilſt alive had by his Authority, and awe upon them, kept within ſome kind of meaſures, but alſo between the Cardinals about the choice of a new Pope, that the Sea was void two years. At that time <hi>Charles,</hi> who took a great care, that the Church ſhould not ſuffer any damage, went with part of his Army into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> where he took <hi>Poggibonci</hi> (the place from whence all the Troubles ſprang) and ſold it to the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi> Which when they had demoliſh'd, they built a new Town, not far from thence upon a plain ground, which they call <hi>Poggibonci,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the old one was called antiently <hi>Bonitium.</hi> After that <hi>Charles</hi> made Peace with thoſe of <hi>Piſa,</hi> whoſe Ships he deſign'd to make uſe of to carry him over into <hi>Africk,</hi> and then intended to return to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, leaving <hi>Ruffus</hi> Earl of <hi>Anguillara,</hi> with part of his Army in <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi> to keep the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> in Order. In the mean time King <hi>Lewis</hi> ſet ſail from <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> and was follow'd by three of his Sons, <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Champaigne,</hi> together with an Apoſtolical Legate. All theſe arrived at <hi>Tunis</hi> the very ſame time, and beſieging the City they deſtroyed all that ever came to their hands. But a Plague happening in the Camp, which for a good while had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected none but inconſiderable Perſons, at laſt took off <hi>Lewis</hi> with his youngeſt Son and the Legate. To him ſucceeded <hi>Philip</hi> his Son, who began now to think of going homeward. But <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> coming up to him, a Peace was concluded upon this Condition, that the Captives on both ſides ſhould be diſmiſſed, and the King of the Countrey ſhould pay <hi>Charles</hi> a certain Tribute, beſides that he ſhould ſuffer the Goſpel to be freely preach'd in his Dominions. Then they brought back their forces into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Campaigne</hi> died at <hi>Trapani</hi>; which made <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi>

But to return to <hi>Clement</hi>: Whoſe life is to be commended in every part of it for his Learning, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Religion, Humanity, Charity to his Neighbours, and to all poor Chriſtians. As for the goods or the Church, he diſtributed them at ſuch a rate, and with ſuch diſcretion, that <hi>he in all probability</hi> gave more to God, than to his own Relations. He had two Daughters by his Wife who died before his Popedom: to one of which, that liv'd in a Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, he gave thirty pounds of ſmall Deniers <hi>Tournois,</hi> and to the other, who was married to a man of an equal fortune, he ordered a portion of three hundred pounds <hi>Tournois,</hi> upon condition ſhe ſhould never ask for one penny more. He had beſides a Nephew that was a Clergy-man, whom when he found to have three Prebends (for ſo they call Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) he forced him to take his choice, which of 'em he would keep and leave the other two. But when his friends were urgent with him not onely to let his Nephew enjoy what he already had, but give him more, and greater preferments, the Holy Man made anſwer, (I would the Popes in our time would follow his Example) that he would obey God, and not fleſh and bloud:
<q>That it was Gods pleaſure, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Church ſhould be beſtow'd to charitable uſes, nor was he worthy to be S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor, who would give more to his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red than to Religion and to Chriſt.</q>
But whilſt he was at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> and news was daily brought to him that <hi>Ednigeth,</hi> a Dutcheſs of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who had been long dead was in very great eſteem for her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, he canoniz'd her. He was alſo wonderfully ſatisfied with the Doctrine of <hi>Bonaventure,</hi> General of the Order of Friers Minors, who at that time wrote gravely, and copiouſly upon the firſt, ſecond, third, and fourth Books of the Sentences. Now the Holy Man dying with ſuch a Character was much lamented and miſs'd by all men. And hence aroſe the Controverſie among the Cardinals, to find out a fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſucceed <hi>Clement.</hi>

For that other perſon held the Ruſſians hand ſo long, till the People of the Houſe came in, who tare treacherous <hi>Arſacida</hi> to pieces, and dragg'd him out of the <hi>Room.</hi> But <hi>Edward,</hi> when he was cured of his Wounds, had a great eſteem for his friend <hi>Theobald,</hi> becauſe he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually animated all Chriſtian Kings and Princes againſt the <hi>Saracens</hi>; and when he went to <hi>Rome</hi> in order to receive the Popedom, being ſent for by the Cardinals, who had elected him, he aſſiſted him extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily with a Ship, with Money, and a ſplendid equipage, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at that time, when <hi>Henry</hi> a Youth, and Son of <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> who was lately dead, came to <hi>Viterbo</hi> to ſee <hi>Clement.</hi> After whoſe death, ſtaying there for ſome time, he was unluckily kill'd.

Upon this account <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who tarried at <hi>Cremona,</hi> was prevail'd upon by the Pope to ſend for the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> and <hi>Venetian</hi> Embaſſadors, and made a Peace between 'em for five years, that they might all go in one body againſt the <hi>Saracens. Italy</hi> was now quiet, when the beginning of an univerſal diſorder roſe from the Venetians now Exactions. For they made a Law, that no one ſhould ſail in the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> eſpecially from <hi>Pola</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> unleſs they paid a Gabel according to the value of their goods. But the <hi>Bologneſes</hi> could not endure this, as being at that time maſters of a great part of <hi>Romagna,</hi> and therefore for three years together they fought the <hi>Venetians</hi> with great variety of Fortune. At laſt being tired out they accepted of a Peace upon this Condition, that they ſhould demoliſh a Caſtle, which they had built upon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mouth of <hi>Po,</hi> that they ſhould have free leave to carry out ſome goods that were there, and then the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould have the ſole cuſtody of the Mouth of the River <hi>Po.</hi> They alſo of <hi>Ancona</hi> were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> challenged the abſolute dominion of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driatick</hi> Sea, and exacted Cuſtom from thoſe that ſailed there. And hereof they complain'd to the Pope, whoſe Duty it is to ſee, that no new Taxes be impoſed. He therefore immediately commanded the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to take off that Impoſition, who anſwered him in theſe very words.
<q>That the Pope did not perfectly underſtand the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that when he did, he would be able to judg better of it.</q>
                  <hi>Gregory</hi> could not make an end of this matter to his mind: becauſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:50681:159"/>
he was forced to go to the Council, which he had called at <hi>Lyons.</hi> Thither alſo went <hi>Paleologus</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with a great Retinue; and made the <hi>Greeks</hi> comply and ſubſcribe to the Opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now the thirteenth time, they having ſo often revolted. Nay farther, ſome Noblemen of <hi>Tartary</hi> were induced by his Authority to receive Baptiſm. Mean time, the Weſtern Empire being vacant, <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> Earl of <hi>Aſſia</hi> is made Emperor by the Electors, upon condition that he would go to <hi>Rome</hi> the next year, to receive the Crown there. But the <hi>Florentines</hi> who were <hi>Guelphs</hi> immediately turned out their Countrymen the <hi>Gibellins,</hi> though they had been reſtored to their Countrey by <hi>Gregory,</hi> as he went into <hi>France.</hi> At which the Pope was ſo angry, that he interdicted them from all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Law, and was very near doing the ſame thing by the <hi>Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,</hi> who had ejected the <hi>Lamberteſcii</hi> and the <hi>Aſinelli, Gibellins</hi> of noble Families: but they ſuffer'd for it not long after. For when they went to fight againſt the <hi>Forleſes,</hi> that had kindly entertain'd ſome perſons whom they had baniſh'd; 'tis ſaid, eight thouſand of the <hi>Bologneſes</hi> were ſlain at one Sally from the Town.

He was a Man of an extraordinary Reputation through his whole Life, for Prudence in the conduct of his Affairs, for Courage, and greatneſs of Mind, that made him contemn Money and all mean things: for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, clemency, bounty to poor Chriſtians, and thoſe eſpecially that fled for refuge into the boſom of the Apoſtolick Sea.</p>

For he did many things that argued him to be guilty of Folly and Levity: and does not deſerve commendations unleſs it be for one thing; and that was; that he aſſiſted young Scholars eſpecially the poorer ſort with money and preferments. At that time the <hi>Venetians</hi> infeſted thoſe of <hi>Ancona</hi> for Merchandizing in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any cuſtom to the <hi>Venetians:</hi> and yet the Pope himſelf to whom they were tributary, did not protect them as he ſhould have done; but onely ſeemed ready with his Tongue to ſay what he was too much a Coward ever to do.

But <hi>Nicolas,</hi> aſſoon as he began his Reign, in the year 1278, reſolv'd to reſtrain <hi>Charles</hi>'s Power, and took from him the Lieutenancy of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>; becauſe, he ſaid, that <hi>Rodulphus</hi> took it ill, and would not perform his promiſe of going upon the Expedition into the holy Land upon any other terms, ſince <hi>Tuſcany</hi> was reckon'd to belong to the juriſdiction of the Empire.

And to bring it about, he perſuaded <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> to endeavour the recovery of the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily</hi> upon the title of his Wife <hi>Conſtantia</hi> who was heir to it: And he took the Honour of Senator from <hi>Charles</hi> and conferr'd it upon himſelf; and made an everlaſting Edict, that no King or Prince ſhould dare to ſue for, or bear that Office. This <hi>Nicolas</hi> (as Authors ſay) was a man of great courage and conduct, and ſo perfect in his life and converſation, that in <hi>Italian</hi> he was commonly called <hi>il Compoſto</hi> or <hi>Compoſto.</hi> He was a lover and admirer of learned men, eſpecially of thoſe who had Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mingled with prudence and Religion.

The Biſhops of <hi>Paleſtrina</hi> and <hi>Treſcat,</hi> were Seculars.

The ſame he did in S. <hi>Pauls.</hi> More than all this, he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced divine Worſhip moſt wonderfully, by encreaſing the number of Canons, and the proviſion that had been made for thoſe who ſerv'd in Churches. Again, he divided the Eccleſiaſtick Orders and appointed to each their Offices. He likewiſe aſſigned every one his Lodging, that even Strangers might know where every Officer, eſpecially the chief Officer was to be found. He finiſh'd the <hi>Lateran</hi> Palace which was begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Adrian</hi> the fifth. He built the <hi>Sancta Sanctorum</hi> from the ground, after the firſt Chappel was ruin'd with age: and beautified the Church it ſelf with Moſaic work (as it is now to be ſeen) and with plaiſter of Marble. And thither he removed the Apoſtles heads, till he had reqair'd St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church at his own Charge. But when it was finiſh'd, he preſently brought 'em back again, in Silver Caſes made by his Order, and, attended by all the People, he laid 'em up in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which was built for the purpoſe. The ſame day he conſecrated the Church, that is, upon the eighth of <hi>July.</hi> Some Hiſtorians ſay, that no one ever ſaid Maſs with more Devotion than he; for during the performance of that Divine Office, he conſtantly wept. He was very godly, and ſuch a Lover of the Friers Minors for that they contemn'd the World, that he has explain'd many doubts relating to that Order in a decretal Epiſtle. When Churches were void, there never was a Pope, that took care ſooner or more deliberately; giving them to the beſt and the fitteſt Men he could find. For he firſt look'd into a mans life and his Learning, and <hi>then gave immediately</hi> the vacant Seas to thoſe that he thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. For he uſed to ſay Delays were dangerous; becauſe there were ſuch men in the World, as would commit Sacriledg with all their hearts. He could not endure Proctors, and Attornies, becauſe they liv'd upon the bloud of the Poor; and thoſe that went to Law, but hated them as a Plague: in which he imitated <hi>Gregory</hi> X. and <hi>John</hi> XXI. But becauſe there were great corruptions among Magiſtrates in all places; he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, that all Offices ſhould be annual only; and if any one durſt to hold 'em longer, he was liable to an <hi>Anathema,</hi> from which he could not be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd but by the Pope himſelf. Beſides theſe things he did a great many more for the good of the Clergy and all Chriſtian People, as it appears in his Titles. And yet he had his faults too, amidſt all theſe commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For he is ſaid to have lov'd his Relations to ſuch a degree, as that he would rob others to give to them. For he took Caſtles from ſome Noble <hi>Romans,</hi> and gave 'em to his own kindred, particularly that at <hi>Soriano</hi>; Where, though he was a moſt temperate man, yet he died ſuddenly in the third year, eighth month, and fifteenth day of his Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate.

four feet and more above the Altar in round S. <hi>Maries.</hi> But his body was carried to <hi>Rome</hi> and buried in the Chappel of S. <hi>Nicolas</hi> which he built in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, in a Marble Tomb beautified with Fret-work, ſtill to be ſeen, <hi>An.

For whilſt the Cardinals were about electing a new Pope at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> and one <hi>Richard,</hi> of the Family of the <hi>Hannibals</hi> (which is the beſt in all <hi>Rome</hi>) was Keeper of the Conclave, two Cardinals of the <hi>

And therefore he went to <hi>Orvieto,</hi> an ancient City, and there performed all the Ceremonies upon the 23d day of <hi>March.</hi> And upon <hi>Eaſter</hi> day he created ſix Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; of which the Earl of <hi>Millain</hi> had the Title of S. <hi>Marcellin</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>; and <hi>Benedict Cajetanus</hi> had that of S. <hi>Nicolas</hi> in the Priſon. As for <hi>Charles,</hi> the King, he not onely receiv'd him kindly when he came to him, but he gave him his former Senatorian Dignity, whereof <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas</hi> had deprived him. But this was not ſo very well approv'd on by all, becauſe it was like to cauſe great Tumults in the City, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> being now reſtored and the <hi>Hannibali</hi> baniſh'd. For <hi>Charles</hi> was a mighty Enemy to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini,</hi> for <hi>Nicolas</hi>'s ſake, whom he hated. For this reaſon <hi>John,</hi> to revenge the injuries done to his Brother <hi>Latinus,</hi> and in defence of the Dignity conferr'd upon himſelf by the <hi>Romans,</hi> got a good Army together, and marching toward <hi>Viterbo,</hi> ſpoiled all their Countrey far and near. But <hi>Martin,</hi> who was then in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefiaſcone,</hi> being concern'd at the miſery of the <hi>Viterbeſes,</hi> ſent <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> a Cardinal of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſine</hi> Family to <hi>Rome</hi> in all haſte to compoſe the buſineſs; who took <hi>John,</hi> the Captain of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, whom he met upon the Road, along with him. Thither came all the Heads
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50681:162"/>
of the Factions by command from the Legat, eſpecially <hi>Richard Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> to be abſolved by the Legat from that Interdiction, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> for breaking into the Conclave, and impriſoning the Cardinals <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini.</hi> He therefore laid himſelf at the Cardinals feet, with a Rope about his neck, (as the greateſt ſign of penitence) and after he had beg'd pardon was abſolv'd. Peace being thus made between both the factions, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Army called back from plundering the <hi>Viter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſes,</hi> the Pope immediately grants the <hi>Romans</hi> a Power to chooſe two Senators out of themſelves, that ſhould govern the City. Accordingly two were choſen, <hi>Hannibal,</hi> Son of <hi>Peter Hannibali,</hi> and <hi>Pandulphus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velli,</hi> who ruled the City very well all the time they were in Office: Eſpecially at that time when Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> excommunicated <hi>Palaeologus</hi> for not keeping the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Alliance made between them. But then <hi>Palaeologus</hi> fearing <hi>Charles</hi>'s Power, made a private League with <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> who laid claim to the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily</hi> in right of his Wife <hi>Conſtantia, Manfred</hi>'s Daughter and <hi>Corradin</hi>'s Niece. Hereupon they prepared a great Navy at the common charge of 'em both: which made the Pope ſend to <hi>Peter,</hi> to know of him, what he meant by all thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations. <hi>Peter</hi> told him, that if he thought his <hi>Shirt could know</hi> what his intentions were, he would tear it from his Body. So the Legat went away without any ſatisfaction: And <hi>Peter</hi> when he had gotten his Navy ready ſails into <hi>Africa,</hi> where he pillaged the Coaſt at <hi>Tunis</hi> extreamly, and then returning into <hi>Sardinia</hi> expected to hear of ſome new commotions in <hi>Sicily</hi> by the contrivance of <hi>John Prochita,</hi> according to an agreement they had made. In the mean time new broils aroſe in <hi>Lombardy.</hi> For the <hi>Viconti</hi> a noble Family there, under the command of <hi>Luchino,</hi> drave the <hi>Turriani</hi> another potent Family out of <hi>Millain.</hi> Which <hi>Luchino</hi> was afterwards ſent as Lieutenant to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> where he reſided at St. <hi>Miniato,</hi> and plagued the <hi>Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thereupon the Pope excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated 'em; but paying a good ſum of money to him for penance they ſoon obtained his pardon. In the mean time the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> whoſe motions <hi>Peter</hi> attended in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> could no longer endure the pride and licentiouſneſs of the <hi>French,</hi> and therefore were perſuaded by <hi>John Prochita</hi> to enter into a Conſpiracy againſt <hi>Charl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

did as he would have them, and breaking forth in the very nick of time they kill'd <hi>Guido</hi> and almoſt all his <hi>French</hi> men. Thus was that City freed from a great Siege. But <hi>Charles</hi> when he heard how the <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> had revolted, and of their cruelty too, went over into <hi>Sicily</hi> with a very conſiderable Army. And firſt he beſieged <hi>Meſſina,</hi> which he had certainly taken by Surrender, but that the <hi>French,</hi> deſirous of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge had threaten'd to raze the City. Beſides <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> who expected (as I told you) ſuch commotions, no ſooner heard of it, but he comes over with all ſpeed from <hi>Sardinia</hi> into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and arriving at <hi>Palermo,</hi> he was very kindly received by the Citizens and all the other <hi>Sicilians,</hi> who alſo ſaluted him by the name of King, whilſt all the Rabble flock'd about him. <hi>Charles</hi> was frighted at this, and therefore leaving <hi>Meſſina</hi> he went immediately into <hi>Calabria,</hi> to ſtay for his Son the Prince of <hi>Salerno,</hi> who, he knew would come very ſhortly out of the Province of <hi>Narbonne</hi> with ſome Recruits. <hi>Charles</hi> expoſtulated with <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> that he who was his Relation, nay of the ſame bloud too ſhould dare to invade his Kingdom. To which he reply'd, that he was ſo compaſſionate, as that he could not deny his aſſiſtance to a miſerable people that were ſo hardly uſed: though he ſaid too, that the Kingdom belong'd to him by right of inheritance, as he was Husband to <hi>Conſtantia, Monford</hi>'s Daughter, and <hi>Corradins</hi> Niece. At laſt when words grew high on both ſides, it came to a Duel; upon this condition though, that each King ſhould have an hundred men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, as being to engage in ſuch a weighty Combat, and the place where they were to fight was to be <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> For both theſe Kings were akin to the King of <hi>England,</hi> who with the aſſiſtance of Pope <hi>Martin</hi> at length made up the difference. But when <hi>Peter,</hi> for all that, made War upon <hi>Charles, Martin</hi> ſent <hi>Gerard,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> his Legat to <hi>Naples,</hi> not onely to keep the People in Allegiance to him, but to aſſiſt him who was but a youth with good counſel and the awe of his preſence. But when <hi>Peter</hi> had ſent <hi>Rogeris Lorias,</hi> his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral to <hi>Naples, Charles</hi> moved toward the Enemy and not far from <hi>Naples</hi> was conquer'd with the loſs of a great many men: nor onely ſo, but he was taken, and carry'd firſt into <hi>Sicily</hi> and then into <hi>Aragon.</hi> But this, without queſtion, had never happen'd if he would but have <hi>hearken'd to</hi> the Legat, (as he ſhould have done) who was of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion; who diſſuaded him and told him that ſuch a mighty Kingdom as that was, ought not to be hazarded at that rate. For not long after his Father <hi>Charles</hi> came with a great Navy, which would have made him able to have coped with the Enemy before he was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. But <hi>Martin</hi> being concern'd very much for <hi>Charles</hi>'s misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, excommunicates <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and gives his Kingdom for a prey to any one that can or will take poſſeſſion of it; abſolving his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from their Oath of Allegiance to him, and exciting all Chriſtians againſt him, as an Uſurper of the Churches Patrimony, according to his opinion. Nay, he would have ſent the Church-Militia to help <hi>Charles,</hi> but that he was fain to wage War in <hi>Romagna</hi> himſelf againſt the <hi>Forleſes,</hi> who by the aid of <hi>Guido</hi> Earl of <hi>Monford,</hi> were ſo bold as to revolt from the Church, and attaque ſome Forts thereabouts. But when <hi>Guido</hi> himſelf repented of what he had done, and had made Peace with the Pope, he not onely demoliſh'd the Walls of <hi>Forli</hi> in revenge
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50681:163"/>
to <hi>Guido Appius,</hi> but he recover'd a great part of <hi>Romagna</hi> in a ſhort time. He had alſo taken <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> as ſure as he attempted it, but that <hi>Rubeus Anguillarius,</hi> Earl of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> died in the action. There were at that time two Generals that commanded the Camp: one of which was ſent into <hi>Tuſcany</hi> to defend that part of the Countrey that lies toward the <hi>Soane,</hi> and the other (whom they call Earl of <hi>Giovenazzo</hi>) continu'd the Siege by the Popes Order, whilſt <hi>Guido Montefeltranus</hi> ſupplied the very Townſmen with neceſſaries under-hand. But in the mean time when <hi>Martin</hi> was at a loſs from which of the two States, <hi>Piſa</hi> or <hi>Genoa,</hi> he ſhould deſire Auxiliaries againſt <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> there aroſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſuch a quarrel between them about the poſſeſſion of <hi>Corſica,</hi> that they themſelves were fain to beg aſſiſtance one againſt another. Then the Pope ſent word to the Apoſtolical Legat, that he ſhould keep the people in order, till <hi>Charles</hi> came with a ſupply. After which <hi>Charles</hi> went into <hi>Naples,</hi> and having ſetled the peoples minds ſailed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Africa</hi> where he died of a Fever: upon which occaſion all the weight of the Government devolv'd upon the Legat. At that time there was a rumour, and almoſt a currant Report, that <hi>Philip</hi> Son of the <hi>French</hi> King, and Earl of <hi>Artois</hi> was coming to receive that Kingdom. But that did not frighten <hi>Peter</hi> from ſpoiling the Country, becauſe he was ſure he came with a ſmall number: For his Father <hi>Philip</hi> was going into <hi>Aragon</hi> with a great Army, to take poſſeſſion of <hi>Peter's</hi> Kingdom, which <hi>Martin</hi> the Pope, by heavy Cenſures firſt laid upon him, had expoſed as a booty to any one that could get it. But the Pope being ſurrounded with ſo many cares, and thoſe increaſed too by new tumults at <hi>Orvieto</hi> (for the <hi>Gibellins</hi> had baniſh'd the <hi>Guelphs</hi>) he went to <hi>Perugia:</hi> where not long after he died of an hectick Fever in the fourth year, and firſt month of his Pontificate, and was buried in the Cathedral. At whoſe Tomb many ſick, blind, deaf, and lame people that are brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, recover from God their former health by the merits of this moſt holy Pope.</p>

For <hi>Pandulphus</hi> was eſteemed a Perſon of ſo much ſeverity, and Juſtice, that whenever the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> had a mind to purge the City of Robbers, Ruffians, Thieves and Parricides (of which at that time there were great numbers in <hi>Rome,</hi> among the Seditious) they deſired no other Senator than <hi>Pandulphus.</hi> And he, though mightily tormented with the Gout both in his feet and his hands; yet in courage and conſtancy of mind he was inferiour to none of thoſe that had their health. <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> alſo was ſometimes troubled with the ſame Diſtemper, inſomuch that he was forced to make uſe of certain Inſtruments made for the purpoſe to ſupport him, when he performed the Prieſtly Office. But
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50681:163"/>
he was a Man of that Conduct and Prudence, that he did not ſeem much deficient in corporal ſtrength: for he himſelf could diſcern ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more of the Affairs of the City, than thoſe that were in it beſides, put 'em all together. He lived in the <hi>Mount di S. Sabina,</hi> and built him a curious Palace there (whoſe ruins are yet to be ſeen) which drew many of the <hi>Romans</hi> to live by him; ſo that the Mount began from his time to be very full of Inhabitants. He was reſolved to injure no Man whilſt he was Pope, but on the contrary to do what good he could to all; and therefore being provoked by the indignities which <hi>Peter King of Aragon</hi> offer'd to him, by endeavouring to get the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> he confirmed <hi>Martin's</hi> Interdictions againſt <hi>Peter.</hi> But <hi>Rodulphus</hi> the Emperor, having a great mind to raiſe money, ſent his Chancellour (one of the Family of the <hi>Fliſci</hi>) into <hi>Tuſcany</hi>; to make all the Country free, eſpecially thoſe who would buy their Liberty. Thoſe of <hi>Lucca</hi> paid upon that account 12000<hi>l.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> ſix thouſand: and as ſoon as they were made perfectly free, they crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a certain kind of Officers (which they call <hi>Arts-maſters</hi>) with a Sword-Bearer. This Sale did not diſpleaſe <hi>Honorius,</hi> though it look'd too mean for ſuch a great Prince; becauſe by that means the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Church would be more ſecure, he thought, when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror had no more power to oppreſs thoſe free Cities. But whilſt the King of <hi>France</hi> beſieged <hi>Girona,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> was ſollicitous, how to hinder the carriage of Proviſions from <hi>Narbonne</hi> into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Camp, he was engaged in a ſharp Conflict, where he received a deadly Wound, of which not long after he dy'd for want of looking to. So that <hi>Girona</hi> was ſurrender'd upon Terms, and ſubmitted to the King of <hi>France</hi>; though he did not long ſurvive the Conqueſt. For he died of a Fever which he caught in the Camp, as he was beſieging <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignano.</hi> His Navy too, not long after that, was taken and burnt in the Port of <hi>Narbonne</hi> by <hi>Roger Loria. Peter</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>James</hi>; whereof he left <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> his eldeſt Son, King of <hi>Aragon</hi> by his Will, and <hi>James,</hi> King of <hi>Sicily.</hi> But when the old Kings were dead, in that manner, as I have told you, the Wars de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved upon the young ones; who attempted on both ſides to make thoſe of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> who were excellent Seamen, of their Party. But theſe two States heing incens'd and arm'd againſt each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, engaged ſo furiouſly at <hi>Malora,</hi> an Iſland near the Port of <hi>Piſa,</hi> that thoſe of <hi>Piſa</hi> loſt forty Ships, or Gallies, and twelve thouſand men; which were partly ſlain, and partly taken. <hi>Honorius</hi> took this misfortune of theirs ſo much to heart, that he had like to have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> who purſu'd the men of <hi>Piſa</hi> with too much ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity. And that unhappy day gave ſuch a ſhock to thoſe of <hi>Piſa,</hi> that they never retrieved themſelves ſince. But <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> went at that time into <hi>Gaſcoigne,</hi> to make peace between <hi>Charles,</hi> a Youth, Son to the King of <hi>France</hi> (who I told you was taken in War) and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of <hi>Aragon.</hi> The buſineſs went as he would have it, and they treated about <hi>Charles</hi>'s freedom, when at the ſame time the <hi>Apoſtolical Legate,</hi> and the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Arras,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Avellino,</hi> poſſeſs themſelves of the City <hi>Catina,</hi> and ſend over thither an Army raiſed out of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> For this reaſon <hi>Edward</hi> return'd home without ſucceſs.

fortune by taking the <hi>French</hi> Fleet as it came back out of <hi>Sicily. Honorius</hi> could not engage in this War, becauſe he was invaded in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magna</hi> by <hi>Guido Feltrini.</hi> But at length, when he had conquer'd <hi>Guido</hi> he recover'd all <hi>Romagna</hi> in a ſhort time: and not long after dy'd, two years and a day after he was made Pope. His body was carried in great State from S. <hi>Sabina</hi> to S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and buried in a Marble Tomb, which is yet extant among thoſe that Pope <hi>Pius</hi> collected, as the Arms of his Family and the Inſcription declare; And indeed he deſerv'd all the honour paid to his dead Corps; becauſe he was a very upright Man, and a great lover of Chriſtian Piety. For he confirm'd not onely the Order of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> which was not very well approved of in ſome Councils, and chang'd their black Cloaks for white ones; but he did the ſame alſo by the order of <hi>Eremites,</hi> which was diſapproved on at <hi>Paris.</hi> But the onely Cardinal, he made, during his Pontificate, was <hi>John Boccamatius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Fraſcati:</hi> for he would ſay, that none but good and learned men ought to be taken into ſo great a Society; not thoſe that were illiterate, and ignorant in the manage of humane Affairs. He loved Courtiers ſo, as that he would go every year, eſpecially in the Summer, to <hi>Tivoli,</hi> on purpoſe to avoid the Heat of the Town, which cauſes many Diſeaſes. When <hi>Honorius</hi> was dead, the Sea was vacant ten months. For the Conclave being ſummon'd to meet at St. <hi>Sabina,</hi> a great many of the Cardinals were taken ſick of a ſudden.

For this reaſon they diſmiſs'd the Conclave, and deferr'd the matter till a more ſeaſonable time; eſpecially becauſe of the Earthquakes, which were then ſo great, that they thought Heaven it ſelf would be angry with 'em, if they did it at that time.</p>

And if he did not do ſo in three years time, he promiſed to return to Priſon; giving his two Sons for Hoſtages; one of which was named <hi>Charles</hi> (who was afterward created King of <hi>Hungary</hi> and called <hi>Marcellus</hi>) and the other <hi>Lewis,</hi> who, when he had lived a good life in the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> was canoniz'd for a Saint. Whilſt theſe things were tranſacted in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Great Turk made uſe of that occaſion, and whilſt the Chriſtians quarrell'd among themſelves thought himſelf ſecure. Wherefore he goes with fire and ſword, and razes <hi>Tripoli</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous City in <hi>Aſia,</hi> killing all the Chriſtians that were there in Gariſon. <hi>Said,</hi> and <hi>Baru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to defend it for time to come, <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Pope did all he could to get Soldiers under Chriſt's Banner, and paid them with his own money. They were about one thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: but there were a great many more that follow'd 'em, without being inrolled, without Colours, or any body to conduct 'em. Who when they were come to <hi>Aca,</hi> they did the Chriſtians as much hurt as they did the <hi>Saracens,</hi> But the Sultan demanded what was his due, as he pretended, which when the Chriſtians refuſed to reſtore, he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd utter ruin to 'em all. Then there aroſe a great queſtion among the Chriſtians, who ſhould have poſſeſſion of <hi>Aca</hi>; for the Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> the Templars of <hi>Germany,</hi> the King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi> did all lay claim to it. Thoſe alſo of <hi>Piſa</hi> had a mind to demand <hi>Aca</hi> and lawfully (as they ſaid themſelves) but that a War which brake out in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> diverted them from ſuch an ill deſign. For they ſtarv'd Earl <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gulinus</hi> in Priſon, where they kept him, his two Sons and two Nieces; and after that, did ſo far animate the <hi>Gibellins</hi> againſt the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> that they threaten'd equal deſtruction to 'em all. They fell firſt upon thoſe of <hi>Arezzo,</hi> becauſe the baniſh'd <hi>Gibellins</hi> deſir'd it; when <hi>William Petramala</hi> was Biſhop of that place, who was aided by Earl <hi>Feltri</hi> the <hi>Florentine.</hi> But the <hi>Florentines</hi> did not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtrong enough, and therefore they ſent <hi>Charles</hi> the Second alſo thither with ſome forces, as he was going through their Country to wait upon the Pope. Their Camps were pitched near one another in the Country of <hi>Tipherno,</hi> by which name they now call the City, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the name of the Caſtle. Immediately as the Battel was juſt begun there were a great many <hi>Florentines</hi> kill'd; but not long after the caſe was alter'd, and, though <hi>William</hi> the Biſhop, and Earl <hi>Feltri</hi> were ſlain, yet there fell of the <hi>Gibellini</hi> three thouſand, and two thouſand were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The Neighbours call the place where they fought, <hi>Campaldino. Charles</hi> having obtain'd ſo great a Victory goes ſtraight to <hi>Nicolas,</hi> and gets the favour to hold of him in <hi>Fee</hi> the Crown of both the <hi>Sicilies.</hi> Which when <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> underſtood, he preſently goes and attaques <hi>Cajetta.</hi> But leſt any thing ſhould be wanting that might diſturb the quiet of Chriſtendom, a fatal War broke out between <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> which did not onely trouble the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in <hi>Aſia</hi> very much, but alſo gave our Enemies great confidence and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50681:165"/>
hopes that they ſhould totally obliterate the Chriſtian Name throughout all <hi>Aſia.</hi> For the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who at that time was ſick, had ſent an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thouſand men to <hi>Acra</hi> under the Command of his Son. But the Siege continuing for two months, the Father died in that time, and the Son ſucceeded him; who attaqued the Town with much greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. For he filled the Trenches, and promiſed all the plunder to the Soldiers. But when he had fought his way to the very Walls, he was beaten back by the Chriſtians, (who made a Sally upon him) even to his Camp, and had a great many of his men hurt in the Action. Whilſt they were thus employ'd in <hi>Aſia, Nicolas,</hi> the Pope, ſends two Legats <hi>à Latere</hi> (as they call'em) i. e. <hi>Benedictus Cajetanus,</hi> and <hi>Gerard</hi> of <hi>Parma</hi> with all ſpeed into <hi>France,</hi> to make a Peace between the two Kings and animate 'em againſt the <hi>Saracens</hi> who then beſieged <hi>Acra.</hi> For he had made a Peace between <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> who was a Captive, upon thoſe Conditions, that I told you before, that they might all be the more free to go againſt the common Enemy. Nay he had begun to provide a Navy, as thinking himſelf almoſt ſure of a Peace; but to no purpoſe. For the Kings did not obey him, when he gave 'em good advice, nor did they that were in Gariſon at <hi>Ptolemais</hi> agree ſo well among themſelves, as to keep out the Enemy according to their power. For having daily loſt a great many of their men, there were at that time but twelve thouſand left; who afterward made their eſcape in a <hi>Corſaire</hi> (or a ſwift ſailing Frigot kept for that purpoſe) along with the Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And though at firſt they had good ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, yet at laſt they were Shipwreck'd near <hi>Cyprus.</hi> But the <hi>Sultan</hi> enter'd the City when the Inhabitants had left it, and deſtroy'd it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with fire and ſword in the 196th year after <hi>Godfry</hi> had taken it. But amidſt ſo many Calamities, the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Armenia</hi> the leſs, formerly called <hi>Cilicia,</hi> continued Chriſtian. At that time <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas</hi> was very urgent with <hi>Rodulphus</hi> the Emperor to ſend his Army into <hi>Aſia,</hi> for fear the Enemy ſhould get the remaining part of it. But <hi>Rodulphus</hi> ſoon after died, and <hi>Adolphus Haſſo</hi> was choſen to be his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor; who, demanding the Rights of the Empire, was kill'd in a fight at <hi>Spire</hi> by <hi>Albertus</hi> Son to <hi>Rodulphus.</hi> He was indeed a brave Man, but had neither men nor money enough: and that was the reaſon that they ſaid, he was rather overpower'd by multitude, than fairly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd. But <hi>Nicolas,</hi> the Pope, through diſcontent (as ſome ſuppoſe) to ſee all things go croſs to his expectation, and being conſcious that he had favour'd Parties more than became a Pope, died at <hi>Rome</hi> in the fourth year, firſt month, and eighth day of his Pontificate near S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Great</hi>; and is there buried, at the upper end of the Church, by Cardinal <hi>Columna,</hi> as you may ſee upon the Pavement, where his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is in <hi>Porphyry.</hi> But after his death the Cardinals went to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugia,</hi> that they might chooſe a Pope with greater freedom, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the buſineſs by quarrels among themſelves two years and three months. In the mean while <hi>Michael Palaeologus,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> dies: but the Prieſts and the Monks would not ſuffer his body to be buried in an holy place, becauſe he joyned with the Weſtern Church in the Council of <hi>Lions.</hi> And indeed <hi>Andronicus, Michael</hi>'s Son, would have declared himſelf of the ſame opinion as the <hi>Latins,</hi> if he had been aſſiſted by our Party. But when the Sea was vacant, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:50681:165"/>
was deſtitute of Friends, and ſo at laſt apoſtarized from the faith. But <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſeeing what would come of it, made a journey from <hi>Narbonne</hi> to <hi>Perugia,</hi> and exhorted the Cardinals ſeveral times to agree, and perfect their Election. And would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd his importunity, had he not been ſeverely rebuked by <hi>Benedict Cajetan,</hi> of <hi>Anagni</hi>; who told him that he was too urgent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſeemed to lay a kind of reſtraint upon the Cardinals, whoſe Votes ought to be free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

After his Creation he went to <hi>Aquila,</hi> and thither he ſummon'd all the Cardinals to him from <hi>Perugia.</hi> But they were very importunate with him both by Letters and Meſſengers, that he would come to <hi>Perugia,</hi> which was a City more agreeable to the Dignity of a Pope. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Caeleſtin</hi>'s Will was at laſt obey'd, who would needs have it ſo, becauſe he underſtood that King <hi>Charles</hi> was of the ſame mind. Thereupon they went all thither, and paid ſuch homage to <hi>Caeleſtin</hi> as became a Pope. Now <hi>Ptolomy</hi> ſays, there were two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men at his Coronation; and that he himſelf was there too. I ſuppoſe the people were taken with the newneſs of the thing, and the holineſs of the Perſon: that a man, that was an <hi>Eremite</hi> ſhould come to ſuch Honour (as if he had been preferr'd by Heaven it ſelf) after ſo long a Conteſt between the Electors. As ſoon as he enter'd upon the Popedom, he made twelve Cardinals; men of the greateſt integrity, of whom two were <hi>Eremites.</hi> But becauſe he did not alter his former way of living and take upon him the Grandeur of a Pope, he was ſo kind, and acceſſible to all that made ſuit to him, as that he granted the ſame things to ſeveral perſons; which brought not onely a Contempt upon his Dignity, but was a leſſening to the Majeſty of a Pope: For indeed he was unfit for publick buſineſs by reaſon of the obſcure life, which he had led in the Wilderneſs. Hereupon they talk'd of depoſing him; eſpecially after the death of <hi>Latinus</hi> the Cardinal, a good man, by whoſe aſſiſtance <hi>Caeleſtin</hi> had hitherto made ſhift to ſupport himſelf under ſo vaſt a burthen. But ſome of the Cardinals being very inſtant, eſpecially <hi>Benedict Cajetan</hi> (a cunning man, and well skill'd in the Civil and Canon Law) who was a great favourite of the Popes, that he would remove himſelf from the Pontificate, leſt the Church of God ſhould be endanger'd by the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of its Governour, he began to think of laying down his Papal Office. But King <hi>Charles</hi> was ſo much concern'd at his levity and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, that he takes the good man to <hi>Naples,</hi> and endeavours to convert him from ſuch baſe thoughts; whilſt the people cry'd out in all
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:50681:166"/>
places, that they would have no other Pope, but <hi>Caeleſtin,</hi> and heartily beſeech'd his Holineſs that ſo it might be. To whom the Pope made anſwer, That he would do nothing but what God would have him do, and what he thought might be for the good of Chriſtendom. At that the Cardinals that deſired he would leave the Papacy were very urgent with him to do it as ſoon as he could; telling him the danger all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom was in by his ignorance, and that all the miſchiefs that then befell the Church would be put to his Account at Dooms-day. The holy, ſimple Man was moved with what they ſaid, and told 'em he would do as they'd have him, if it might lawfully be done. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there was an Order made by unanimous conſent, that the Pope ſhould have liberty to depoſe himſelf. Which Conſtitution <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth his Succeſſor afterward confirm'd, as appears in the ſixth Book of the <hi>Decretals.</hi> Then <hi>Caeleſtin</hi> return'd to his private life again, and gave the Cardinals power to put another Pope in his place, in the ſixth month of his Pontificate. And <hi>Benedict Cajetan</hi> by that means, having moſt Votes, was choſen Pope; who ſeiſed upon <hi>Caeleſtin</hi> by the way as he was going into his Hermitage, committing him to the cuſtody of the Governor of a certain Caſtle, called <hi>Fumo,</hi> in <hi>Campagna di Roma.</hi> For which he ſaid his reaſon was, leſt the Authors of Sedition ſhould one time or other bring ſome calamity upon the Church of God under his conduct; although he really admired the Sanctity of the Man. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this is certain that <hi>Boniface</hi> was very ungrateful, as well as ſubtil, firſt, to chouſe a good man out of his Dignity, to ſatisfie his own am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and then to take him (when he would have retired again to his ſolitude) and keep him in Priſon, till he dy'd for very grief, before his time, in ſeventeen months after he firſt came to the Pontificate. There are ſome that ſay, this <hi>Caeleſtin</hi> was ſo famous for Miracles after his death, that there were frequent Diſcourſes in Councils about his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonization; and that many people worſhip'd him as a Saint, and put him in the Catalogue of Confeſſors.

He was a man of great Learning and Experience: as having lived long in Publick, and riſen to the Popedom by all the degrees of Honour, though not without ſome imputation of Pride and Ambition. For whilſt he was Cardinal-Prieſt of S. <hi>Martins in the Mount,</hi> he was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of the Papal Dignity, that he omitted no fraudulent or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct means, that might in his opinion conduce to his obtaining of it. Beſides, he was a man of that arrogance that he contemn'd every body, and recalled ſome Indulgences granted by <hi>Nicolas</hi> the fourth and <hi>Caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> the fifth. He alſo perſecuted the <hi>Gibellines</hi> extreamly: from whence aroſe that quarrel between the Pope and the <hi>Gibellines</hi> of <hi>Columna,</hi> who
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:50681:166"/>
alſo maintained their party againſt the Pope at <hi>Anagni.</hi> Thereupon he began to calumniate, and traduce them in general; but eſpecially two Cardinals, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> two famous Men of the ſame Family; that upon the death of ſeveral Popes, they had waſted the Churches Treaſure, and ſpread abroad ſcandalous Pamphlets againſt his own Perſon. For after he had done 'em Injury, they did indeed write to ſeveral Kings, Princes and States concerning <hi>Boniface</hi>'s Arrogance and Ambition: how he had poſſeſſed himſelf of the Papal Sea againſt all right and reaſon, after he cheated <hi>Caeleſtin</hi> out of it, and then put him in Priſon. For there are ſome that write, how <hi>Boniface</hi> ſent ſome cunning Rogues pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in the Night-time, to ſpeak in a ſtrange Tone through <hi>Caeleſtins</hi> Chamber-Wall, and tell the poor, ſimple man (as it were by a Voice from Heaven) that he muſt lay down the Popedom if he would be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The Cardinals were cited but did not appear, becauſe they fear'd <hi>Boniface</hi>'s ſeverity and reſolution. Wherefore they retired to <hi>Nepi,</hi> with all the Family of the <hi>Columneſes</hi>; and being declared Schiſmaticks by a publick Decree, they had their Benefices, Dignities, Eſtates, Caſtles, and Towns taken from them. Which Deprivation <hi>Boniface</hi> afterward reduced into the form of a Decree, as appears in the Book called <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> After that <hi>Boniface</hi> raiſed a great many Men and Arms, to quell them, and beſieged <hi>Paleſtrina,</hi> where they were ingariſon'd with one <hi>Sarra</hi> a famous Man, who was their Uncle. And when they got away from thence, after he took and plunder'd the Town, he purſu'd 'em to <hi>Zagalora,</hi> and <hi>Columna:</hi> from whence alſo they were forced to fly not long after by reaſon of the multitude of their Enemies, by whom theſe Caſtles likewiſe were deſtroy'd, but eſpecially that of <hi>Columna,</hi> which was their native Country. But the Cardinals got away from thence too, and went to <hi>Rieti</hi>; though <hi>Sarra</hi> ſtaid a long time in the Woods at <hi>Antium,</hi> for fear of <hi>Boniface</hi>'s cruelty. But falling into the hands of certain Pirates, he was put to the Oar, and by that means ſuffer'd a great deal of miſery: though he was more willing to endure baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and hardſhip in that manner, than to feel <hi>Boniface</hi>'s Tyranny, who hated the whole Race of the <hi>Gibellines.</hi> 'Tis well known what he ſaid to <hi>Prochetus,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Genoa,</hi> when he came and laid himſelf at his feet upon an <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday</hi>; For whereas the Prieſt uſes to ſay, Remember, man, that thou art Aſhes and into Aſhes ſhalt thou return; he alter'd ſome of the words and ſaid, Remember, man, that thou art a <hi>Gibellin,</hi> and with the reſt of the <hi>Gibellines</hi> into Aſhes ſhalt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: and, with that, he threw ſome Aſhes into his Eyes, not upon his head, as the cuſtom is. Nay, he deprived him of his Arch-Biſhoprick, for the very name of the <hi>Gibellines</hi>; though he reſtored him afterward, when he underſtood that the Cardinals of <hi>Columna,</hi> did not go to <hi>Genoa,</hi> as he ſuppoſed they had done. The <hi>Columneſes</hi> being baniſh'd in this ſort, <hi>Boniface</hi> appointed a double Anniverſary, one in honour of the Apoſtles and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and another in honour of thoſe four Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church, <hi>Gregory, Auſtin, Jerome,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe canonized <hi>Lewis</hi> (one of the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Family, Son to <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, who, ſome ſay, was profeſs'd of the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi>) whilſt he was at <hi>Civita Vecchia.</hi> After that he turn'd out the Secular Canons from the Cathedral of <hi>Alby,</hi> and put Regulars in their room, at the requeſt of <hi>Bernard Caſtanetus,</hi> Biſhop of the Place. He alſo put
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:50681:167"/>
forth a ſixth Volume, or Code of the Pontificial or Canon Law, which was compiled by three very learned Men (according to his Order) with the addition of ſome new Decrees of his own. The City of <hi>Gubio,</hi> which by the inſtigation of the <hi>Gibellines</hi> had revolted from the Church, he in a ſhort time recover'd. He denied <hi>Albertus</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> to confirm him in the Empire, though he petitioned for it ſeveral times. But when <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> was dead, and <hi>Robert,</hi> Son of <hi>Charles,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> or <hi>Terra d' Otranto</hi> was gone over into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and had taken <hi>Catina,</hi> there brake out ſuch a War of a ſudden, that almoſt all <hi>Italy</hi> was in an Uproar. For the <hi>Sicilians</hi> who favour'd the <hi>Arago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,</hi> got a Navy together, and not onely conquer'd <hi>Philip, Robert</hi>'s Brother, but took him and put him in Priſon. Whereupon <hi>Robert</hi> left <hi>Catina,</hi> and return'd into <hi>Italy</hi> without accompliſhing his Deſigns. But <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> coming out of <hi>Spain</hi> with an Army into <hi>Sicily,</hi> did not onely recover all <hi>Sicily,</hi> but <hi>Terra d' Otranto</hi> too. In <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Genoa</hi> did burn with ſo much hatred againſt the Inhabitants of <hi>Piſa,</hi> that they not only took <hi>Leghorn</hi> and burnt it, but they ſunk Merchants Ships in the mouth of the River, to hinder the men of <hi>Piſa</hi> from ſailing out. Theſe things were carry'd on in <hi>Italy,</hi> to the no ſmall detriment of the Country; whilſt the Pope ſate ſtill, nor would interpoſe his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make Peace in any place. And leſt you ſhould think Heaven was at peace with Mankind, there was of a ſudden ſuch an Earthquake, as never was known before, which laſted at ſeveral places a great many Days, and threw down many Houſes. The Pope was then, with all the whole Court, at <hi>Rieti:</hi> and fearing leſt he ſhould be knock'd on the head with the fall of Houſes, he cauſed a little Hutt to be built of ſmall planks, in a wide Field which was in the Cloyſter of the Friers <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>; and there he kept for ſome time, though it were bitter cold Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For this Commotion began upon St. <hi>Andrews</hi> day. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared alſo at that time a Comet, which was a ſign of ſome great Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to come. But <hi>Boniface</hi> after ſo many and ſuch continu'd Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes came to himſelf, and made ſeveral Cardinals, of which number were the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Toledo, Richard</hi> of <hi>Siena<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nicolas</hi> of <hi>Treviſo,</hi> Maſter of the Order of <hi>Preachers, John Murro,</hi> General of the <hi>Minors,</hi> and one <hi>Peter,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> He alſo kept a Jubilee in the year 1300. and gave a full pardon of all their ſins to thoſe that had viſited the Apoſtles Tombs, after the manner that is preſcribed in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though the <hi>Jews</hi> at firſt had quite another ſentiment of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. For they kept a Jubilee every fiftieth Year, wherein Debtors were releaſed from their Creditors, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſays, and Servants, or Slaves challenged their freedom. From whence the Jubilee imports li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty both in mind and body. For they are truly ſaid to be free, whoſe ſins are forgiven. He commanded it to be kept every hundredth year. For this reaſon, that year, there came ſuch a multitude of people to <hi>Rome</hi> from all parts, that you could hardly ſtir in the ſtreets, though they are very large and ſpatious, it was ſo throng'd. There came to <hi>Rome</hi> at that time <hi>Charles</hi> Earl of <hi>Valois,</hi> Brother to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who married the Daughter of <hi>Balwin</hi> late Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and got leave of <hi>Boniface,</hi> that his Father-in-law might endeavour to recover the Empire, of which by force he had been deprived. <hi>Boniface</hi> was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to gratifie him, becauſe he intended to make uſe of their aſſiſtance
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:50681:167"/>
toward ſending an Army into <hi>Aſia,</hi> to recover <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But whilſt things were coming to a ſettlement, he made <hi>Charles</hi> ſole Governour of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony, and ſent a Legat into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> to appeaſe the new broils there. For inſtead of <hi>Gibellins</hi> and <hi>Guelphs</hi> they were called <hi>Whites,</hi> and <hi>Blacks.</hi> But the Legat could do no good though he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd to interdict them; nor could <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> who came thither by the Pope's Order, reſtrain the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſo much, but that they did drive the <hi>Albi,</hi> or <hi>Whites,</hi> out of their City and kill a great many of 'em beſides. For, at that time, the <hi>Gibellines</hi> were called, the <hi>Whites.</hi> But the Pope having long premeditated of his Expedition to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he ſends the Biſhop of <hi>Apamea</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> to exhort him into the ſame Deſign. He went; but when he came thither and could do no good by fair words, he was fain to make uſe of Menaces. At which <hi>Philip</hi> was very angry and threw him into Priſon. Which when the Pope underſtood, he ſent the Arch-Deacon of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> an excellent perſon, thither immediately, to command <hi>Philip</hi> in his name, to ſet the Biſhop of <hi>Apamea</hi> at Liberty. If he would not do it, he bid him declare publickly, that the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> was fallen to the Church by <hi>Philips</hi> contumacy, and foraſmuch as he had broken the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and order'd him farther, to lay a Curſe upon him, and abſolve all the <hi>French</hi> from their Allegiance. The Arch-Deacon did all this very chearfully, and compelled the King to diſmiſs the Biſhop. But the King, having a mind to take ſome part of a Revenge for the injuries offer'd to him by the Pope, ſet forth an Edict, that no man ſhould go out of his Kingdom to <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſend money thither. The ſecond year after the Jubilee <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> went to <hi>Charles</hi> the Second his Couſin. At whoſe coming <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> was concern'd, and deſired a Peace, which he obtained upon condition, that he, reſtoring what he had taken in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhould keep <hi>Sicily</hi> as long as he lived. But when <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> went out of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> the <hi>Whites,</hi> who were driven out of <hi>Florence</hi> went in great numbers to <hi>Forli:</hi> among whom there was one <hi>Dantes Aldegerius,</hi> a very learned Man, and an excellent Poet in his Mother-Tongue: this Perſon endeavoured to return into his own Country ſeveral times, but in vain; although he were aſſiſted by the <hi>Bolognians,</hi> and <hi>Canegrandis</hi> Governour of <hi>Verona,</hi> with whom he lived afterward for ſome time in all the freedom of converſation. There are ſome Authors that tell us, how <hi>Boniface</hi> about this time cauſed the body of one <hi>Hermanius,</hi> that had been worſhip'd in <hi>Ferrara</hi> as a Saint for twenty years, to be taken out of the ground, and burnt, becauſe he had made a ſtrict inquiry into his Heretical Opinions. I ſuppoſe he was one of the <hi>Fratricelli,</hi> or Holy-Brotherhood, whoſe Sect at that time was very numerous. In the mean time <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Boniface</hi>'s Arrogance very ill, called an Aſſembly at <hi>Paris</hi> of the Clergy and Nobility: and recounting the injuries that <hi>Boniface</hi> had done to him, his Ambition, and Cheats which he had uſed to get the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which he was unjuſtly poſſeſſed of, he appealed to the Sea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick, which, he ſaid, was then vacant, and to the next Council. At which <hi>Boniface,</hi> being ſtartled, called a General Council, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared <hi>Philip</hi> and his Kingdom ſubject to <hi>Albert</hi> the Emperor, whom in the beginning of his Pontificate he had repulſed. Then <hi>Philip,</hi> thinking to tame his pride, ſent <hi>Sarra</hi> of <hi>Columna</hi> (who was known and redeemed
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:50681:168"/>
from the Pirates, at <hi>Marſeilles</hi>) with <hi>Nogaretius</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Cavalier, and a truſty Soul, to <hi>Rome,</hi> for no other end (as he declared himſelf) but to publiſh his Appeal. But he had a quite different Deſign. For <hi>Sarra,</hi> putting on the diſguiſe of a Slave, went into <hi>Campagna di Roma</hi>; where gathering to him as many friends as he could, he ſent <hi>Nogaretius</hi> with two hundred <hi>French</hi> Horſe, which he had liſted out of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois</hi>'s Army, before to <hi>Ferentino</hi>; to aſſiſt him, if need were. But him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf went into <hi>Anagni</hi> privately, in the Night, and by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Gibellines,</hi> whom <hi>Boniface</hi> had teazed extreamly for a long time, he broke the Door open, and took the Pope by ſurpriſe in the Houſe where he was born, and ſo brought him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where thirty five days after he died for grief, in the eighth year, ninth month and ſeventeenth day of his Pontificate. He was buried in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, in a Tomb that he built himſelf before he died; which is yet to be ſeen in a Chappel which he made of Fret-work. He likewiſe built the Pulpit and the <hi>Portico</hi> in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> where Curſes are pronounced upon the Sacrament; and where he laid that Curſe upon <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Columne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Thus died <hi>Boniface,</hi> who made it his buſineſs rather to infuſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour than Religion into Emperors, Kings, Princes, Nations, and States; and would pretend to give and take away Kingdoms, to baniſh and to recall men, as he thought fitting, to ſatisfie his pride and covetouſneſs, which was unſpeakable. Therefore let other Princes as well Religious, as Secular, learn by his Example to govern the Clergy and the Laity, not proudly and diſdainfully, as this party of whom we ſpeak, but holyly and modeſtly, as Chriſt our King, and his Diſciples, and true Followers. And let 'em deſire rather to be beloved than feared; which is uſually the juſt bane of Tyrants. Some ſay he cheriſh'd the Feuds among the <hi>Italians,</hi> eſpecially between the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were two States, very powerful at Sea.</p>

From which Station he was choſen Pope, and in that place alſo gave great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of his Virtue. For he lived after ſuch a manner, that he may well be reckon'd among the number of thoſe that are in Bliſs. But as ſoon as he got into the Apoſtolical Chair, he cites <hi>Nogaretius,</hi> and <hi>Sarra</hi> and all thoſe of <hi>Anagni</hi> that conſpired to take <hi>Boniface,</hi> to come before him; but they not appearing, he laid an heavy Curſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50681:168"/>
'em their goods again, onely he enjoyn'd 'em to let the <hi>Red Hat,</hi> that <hi>Boniface</hi> had taken from 'em, lie by for ſome ſhort time. Having ſetled the Affairs of the City in this manner, and made ſome Cardinals (of whom <hi>Nicolas</hi> a <hi>Prateſe</hi> of the Order of <hi>Preachers</hi> was one) he immediately applies himſelf to procure a general Peace in <hi>Italy.</hi> And becauſe there were greater tumults in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> than any where elſe, he ſent <hi>Nicolas</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Oſtia</hi> thither with full Commiſſion; who made new Officers in <hi>Florence,</hi> and put 'em into the Houſe, which they had built for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Magiſtrates, now called the <hi>Palais</hi> of their Lords. But at that time <hi>Nicolas</hi> thought he might do more than ſo, and therefore ſpoke about recalling the perſons that were baniſh'd: Which Propoſal not taking effect as he would have had it, he declared a Curſe upon them, and went to <hi>Prato.</hi> But not long after, <hi>Benedict</hi> dying, <hi>Tuſcany</hi> was again in an uproar, for the baniſh'd of all places met near <hi>Bologna,</hi> reſolving immediately to enter <hi>Florence,</hi> and thereupon in the Night getting over the Walls which were not then finiſh'd, near the Gate, that leads to <hi>Bologna,</hi> they advanced as far as the Church of S. <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata,</hi> that was begun to be built a little before. But whilſt they look'd too eagerly after the plunder, and conſulted their friends what they had beſt to do, they gave their Enemies time to take courage, and raiſe Arms; inſomuch that they quickly drave 'em out, and killed a great many of their men. Then they got <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Calabria</hi> to be their General, and were grown confident they had ſtrength enough not onely to defend their own but to attaque their Neighbours too. Hereupon they beſiege <hi>Piſtoia,</hi> which thoſe within it did ſo bravely defend, that with one Sally they beat <hi>Robert</hi> and all his Army back to <hi>Prato.

But <hi>Robert</hi> went away for <hi>Avignion</hi> to complement the Pope, and then the <hi>Piſtoieſes,</hi> tired out by this long Siege; at length concluded upon a Surrender.

But he was to go on toward <hi>Naples,</hi> and ſo left <hi>Dego Catelano,</hi> an eminent Perſon, with a Troop of Horſe in the Gariſon.

them from the Caſtle, and kill'd a great many of them, hanging up eight and twenty of the Houſe of <hi>Eſte,</hi> who aſpir'd to the Dominion. At that time <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lucenburgh</hi> was choſen Emperor by the <hi>Germans,</hi> and confirm'd by the Pope upon condition, that he ſhould come into <hi>Italy</hi> within two years and receive his Crown at <hi>Rome.</hi> This the Pope did to the end that the commotions in <hi>Italy</hi> would be ſuppreſs'd by the arrival of the Emperor. Who promiſed to perform what the Pope had injoyn'd him, and immediately ſent Agents into <hi>Italy</hi> to all the States and Princes there; but chiefly to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who at that time haraſs'd them of <hi>Arezzo.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> made anſwer, That ſo great a Prince as he was did not do prudently, in endeavouring to bring Foreiners into <hi>Italy,</hi> which was a Country that, as Emperor, he ought to defend from ſuch with his utmoſt power. And that he did not do well to protect them of <hi>Arezzo,</hi> who, he knew had baniſh'd the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> their fellow Citizens: whereas it was the Emperors prerogative alone to baniſh or to recall from Exile. They ſay that <hi>Dantes</hi> then told the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> They were blind, for making ſuch a fooliſh anſwer to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, than which nothing could be more to the diſadvantage of their State, eſpecially when ſo great and Warlike a Prince with ſo great an Army approached them. But indeed they were encouraged by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of King <hi>Robert,</hi> who as he went into his Kingdom, gave them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that he would always be a Patron to the <hi>Guelphin</hi> Faction. The Emperor was now advanc'd as far as <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where in the Plains all the Princes, or Governors of Cities came to meet him. There were at that time two principal Factions in <hi>Millain,</hi> the <hi>Turriani,</hi> and the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conti. Guido Turriano</hi> was Head of the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> as being Captain of the people (to uſe their own word) and <hi>Maffeo Viconti</hi> of the <hi>Gibellins.</hi> And <hi>Guido</hi> fearing leſt the <hi>Viconti</hi> ſhould get into <hi>Henry</hi>'s favour before him upon the account of their Faction, he raiſed an Army and encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Country of <hi>Millain,</hi> to ſee, as he himſelf ſaid, who durſt come into that City without his leave. When at the ſame time <hi>Maffeo</hi> ſent Agents to the Emperor to invite him to <hi>Millain,</hi> which was a City, he told him, that was the very Manſion-houſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Henry</hi> drew his Forces near to the City, and made a great buſtle, though <hi>Guido</hi> was got in before him. But he allay'd all Tumults by a compoſition which he made upon theſe Terms; That <hi>Guido</hi> ſhould have <hi>Marcelli,</hi> and <hi>Maffeo</hi> be Captain General of his Horſe. And thus the Emperor having gotten poſſeſſion of <hi>Millain,</hi> almoſt all the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Cities ſurrendred preſently, except <hi>Aleſſandria.</hi> Then he received the <hi>Iron Crown</hi> at <hi>Millain,</hi> according to cuſtom, but put the Citizens to ſo much expence, that the Commonalty finding themſelves rather op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed than veſted with the Liberty they expected, betook themſelves to their Arms: The <hi>Germans</hi> ſeeing their men kill'd by both Factions, went out of the Suburbs into the City, and called the Heads of the Parties to 'em. But <hi>Galeatius,</hi> Son to <hi>Maffeo Viconti,</hi> left his Father at home and went with a conſiderable number of Suppliants to wait upon the Emperor and told him, That the <hi>Turriani,</hi> affecting Sovereignty, had made that uproar in the City. Whereupon the <hi>Germans</hi> joyning the <hi>Gibellin</hi> Faction, drave the <hi>Turriani,</hi> (after ſome ſmall reſiſtance at S. <hi>Martes New-ſtreet</hi>) out of the City: from whence they fled in great numbers to <hi>Vercelli</hi> by the perſuaſion of <hi>Guido.</hi> Thirty of this Faction

being kill'd, of which four were <hi>Turriano</hi>'s. After this <hi>Henry</hi> moved toward <hi>Cremona</hi> and <hi>Crema,</hi> and called the <hi>Guelphs</hi> before him there, who had turn'd out the <hi>Gibellins,</hi> but he dealt mildly with the <hi>Cremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,</hi> becauſe they rendered themſelves ſo freely, though he was a little ſeverer upon the <hi>Cremeſes,</hi> and demoliſh'd their Walls. Which ſtrook ſuch terror into thoſe of <hi>Parma</hi> (who by the perſuaſion of one <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Correggio</hi> had received the <hi>Roſſi</hi> into their Town) that immediately they drove out the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and took in the Emperors Lieutenant. Thoſe of <hi>Breſcia</hi> defended themſelves for ſome time: but being ſmartly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued by <hi>Henry,</hi> they fled in the Night to the Mountains, and left the City quite empty. The <hi>Germans</hi> enter'd it preſently, and pulled down the Walls. At which Calamities of their Neighbours, the people of <hi>Mantua, Verona, Vicenza, Padua, Treviſo,</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> were ſo affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they immediately ſubmitted to the Emperors Orders. Thoſe alſo of <hi>Piacenza</hi> turn'd out <hi>Albertus Scotus,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> and took in the Emperors Governour. Having ſetled Affairs after this manner in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> the Emperor went through <hi>Piacenza</hi> to <hi>Genoa,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with <hi>Amadeus</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> attended by the Agents from <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Genoa.</hi> Thither came Embaſſadors from <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> not long after; the former to make a ſhew of friendſhip, and the latter to aſſure him of the real love which they had for him. For <hi>Robert</hi> had ſent his Mareſchal into <hi>Tuſcany</hi> with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, to aſſiſt the <hi>Floretines</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Lucca,</hi> if need were, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperor. But <hi>Henry</hi> went by Sea to <hi>Piſa,</hi> and having ſent his Land-forces before him, did the men of <hi>Lucca</hi> a great deal of damage. Hitherto I thought fit to relate all the inconveniences which were brought upon the <hi>Italians,</hi> which ſome impute wholly to <hi>Clement,</hi> who ſolicited <hi>Henry</hi> to come with an Army into <hi>Italy:</hi> Whilſt others tell us, that <hi>Clement</hi> did it for the advantage of the Country, becauſe of the civil Diſcords among 'em, which were the cauſe of much blood-ſhed in every City, nay in every little Caſtle. The Citizens were ſlain, old men murther'd, young Children daſh'd againſt the ground, with a boundleſs cruelty. Whereupon <hi>Clement</hi> uſed that ſaying of <hi>Homer,</hi> Let there be but one chief Lord, one Judg of all matters. <hi>Henry</hi> went on toward <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Son to <hi>Amadeus,</hi> with five hundred Horſe before, who taking up his quarters at one <hi>Stephen Columna</hi>'s Houſe, near the <hi>Lateran,</hi> put the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> Faction in a terrible fear. But <hi>Henry</hi> came firſt to <hi>Viterbo</hi> and thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was very kindly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not onely by all the Nobility, but by the Citizens in general. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that being Crown'd by three Cardinals, he made the <hi>Romans</hi> ſwear Allegiance to him, as the cuſtom is, and made a great Feaſt, to which he invited all the Noblemen of the City, except the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſins.</hi> But leſt in ſuch a concourſe of people, there ſhould ariſe any tumult through the animoſities of ſome men, he planted his Soldiers in the Theatres, Baths and other fortified places; in the ſtrength of which Guards he was ſo confident, that he had the courage to demand of the people a Tribute which they never uſed to pay. Hereupon all the Citizens of both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions fled to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſins,</hi> who had ſet good Guards about their Houſe, which ſtood near the <hi>Tiber</hi> and hard by <hi>Hadrians</hi> Bridg. At that the Emperor was ſo enraged, that he ſummoned the <hi>Sea-Archers,</hi> whom the men of <hi>Piſa</hi> had ſent him, to march into the City againſt the <hi>Romans</hi>;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:50681:171"/>
but they were ſurpriſed and ſoon routed by <hi>John,</hi> the Brother of King <hi>Robert,</hi> who had placed his Sea-forces under the <hi>Mount di S. Sabina.</hi> He alſo let in the Horſe who quarter'd not far off, and by the aid of the <hi>Roman</hi> people forced the Emperour himſelf to retreat as far as <hi>Tivoli.</hi> After him <hi>John, Robert</hi>'s Brother went away by Command from the Cardinals, and left the City quiet. But <hi>Henry</hi> going from <hi>Perugia</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Arezzo,</hi> where he accuſed <hi>Robert</hi> the King of Treaſon; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not appear upon Summons, deprived him of his Kingdom, againſt the mind of <hi>Clement,</hi> who thought he had done a thing of ſuch conſequence in a very improper place, beſides that it was none of his Prerogative. For he ſaid, It was Popes peculiar Province to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily</hi> on both ſides the <hi>Pharo.</hi> The Emperor marching from <hi>Arezzo</hi> led his Army toward <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Lucca,</hi> who were Allies to <hi>Robert.</hi> But ſeeing he was not able to ſtorm a Town, he poſſeſs'd himſelf of <hi>Poggibonci</hi>; which when he had fortified, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared War againſt the <hi>Seneſes,</hi> becauſe they were ſo niggardly, and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in ſupplying him with Proviſions. But falling ſick he went to the Bath at <hi>Macerata,</hi> from whence he came back to <hi>Bonconvento</hi> much weaker than he was before. There, after ſome days, he died; but it was ſuſpected, he was poiſon'd by a <hi>Monk</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> who was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by large Rewards and Promiſes to give him the Euchariſt dipped in Poiſon. The State of <hi>Piſa</hi> (now that the Emperor was dead) fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the power of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and therefore choſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gutio Fagiolano</hi> their Captain and ſole Governor; who not long after reduced thoſe of <hi>Lucca,</hi> and took away their Lands from 'em, by the aſſiſtance of the Cavalry, that had ſerved under <hi>Henry.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Clement</hi> was very much troubled not onely at all the other evils that <hi>Italy</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, but that S. <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Church ſhould be burnt down. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent Money to the Clergy and people of <hi>Rome</hi> toward the repair of that Church, though there was ſuch ſcarcity and Dearth in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try at that time, that he could hardly buy himſelf Victuals and Drink. Which miſeries were foretold by frequent Eclipſes of the Sun, ſeveral Comets, and the Plague which was almoſt Epidemical. But <hi>Clement</hi> apply'd himſelf to ſettle the State of the Church, and therefore he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed his Epiſcopal Function three times, not onely in making ſeveral Cardinals, who were excellent Men, but in three Councils which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſeveral places and at ſeveral times he did many things with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and deliberation. For he ſuppreſs'd <hi>Dulcinus</hi>'s Sect (as I told you) that oppoſed the Churchmen, and took off the Templers, who were fallen into very great Errors (as, denying Chriſt, &amp;c.) and gave their goods to the Knights of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He likewiſe withſtood the King of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Poictou</hi> when he made unreaſonable and unhandſom Demands; for the King would have had <hi>Boniface</hi> cenſur'd and <hi>Nogare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Sarra</hi> abſolv'd. The firſt requeſt he never obtein'd, but the ſecond he at laſt had granted to him, upon <hi>Nogaretius</hi>'s Promiſe, that he would go againſt the <hi>Saracens</hi> for Penance. Which expedition <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> himſelf had a great mind to, as appears by his Councils. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he canonized <hi>Caeleſtin</hi> the fifth by the name of <hi>Peter the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,</hi> becauſe approved by Miracles; and ſet forth the <hi>Clementines,</hi> which he compoſed during the Council at <hi>Vienna.</hi> But in ſucceeding time he was afflicted with divers Diſeaſes: for he was troubled ſometimes with
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50681:171"/>
a Dyſentery, ſometimes with a pain in his Stomach, or his Sides, of which he dy'd in the eighth year, tenth month, and fifteenth day of his Pontificate. The Sea was then vacant two years, three months, and ſeventeen days, whilſt the Cardinals were at a ſtand, whom they ſhould chooſe. Nor was there leſs Diſcord among the Electors of the Empire, upon the Death of <hi>Henry,</hi> ſome propoſing <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> others <hi>Frederick,</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> And theſe two engaging in War one againſt the other, <hi>Frederick</hi> was Conquer'd: at which <hi>Lewis</hi> grew ſo proud, that he not onely called himſelf <hi>Emperor,</hi> without Authority from <hi>Rome</hi>; but favour'd the <hi>Viconti</hi> in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> ſo far, that they got into <hi>Millain.</hi> And this he did to make his own paſſage more eaſie toward <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was to receive a golden Crown according to the uſual Cuſtom. Then began the people of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and all the <hi>Guelphs</hi> to tremble, when they ſaw <hi>Lewis</hi> Emperor, and that he was likely to recover all the rights of the Empire in a ſhort time, by the help of the <hi>Viconti</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gutio Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giolani</hi> who was ſole Governour of <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Lucca.</hi> Wherefore they endeavour'd to bring over to their Party by Promiſes and Preſents, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramala,</hi> Biſhop and Lord of <hi>Arezzo,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Tarento,</hi> a Prince and Brother to King <hi>Robert.</hi> For <hi>Philip</hi> at that time was very ſtrong in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, and a very good Soldier.</p>

From thence he removed with the whole Court to <hi>Avignion,</hi> where he made eight Cardinals in the <hi>Ember-week</hi> before <hi>Advent:</hi> ſome of which were <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Caturco,</hi> his Siſters Son, and <hi>John Cajetan,</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Deacon of S. <hi>Theodores,</hi> of the Family of the <hi>

He forced <hi>Hugo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caturco,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh his Biſhoprick and Prieſthood, and ſtripp'd him of all his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifical Ornaments, as, the Ring, the Mitre, the Coife, the Cap, and the Rocket. And after he had deprived, degraded, and (to uſe their own phraſe) deliver'd him over to the ſecular juriſdiction, he was tortur'd to Death for conſpiring againſt the Pope. The Church of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> which he loved entirely, he made an Arch-biſhoprick; and improved ſix Caſtles that belong'd to it into ſo many Cities, that the Arch-biſhop might have ſomething under him which was honourable, and worth his governing. He alſo joyn'd <hi>Limoſa,</hi> i. e. <hi>Wiſelburg,</hi> and the Abby of S. <hi>Pontius</hi> to the Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Narbonne</hi>; nay ſo much addicted was he to Novelties, that he divided ſome ſingle Biſhopricks into two, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted others that were diſtinct; turning Abbaties into Biſhopricks and Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks into Abbaties. He likewiſe created new Dignities and new Societies in the Church; and alter'd thoſe, which had been formerly conſtituted.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50681:172"/>
Yet he was ſo grateful, that he confirmed the Deſign of ſetting forth that Book called <hi>Clementinae,</hi> or <hi>Rules of Clement</hi>; and commanded all Doctors in publick Schools, to read it for Lectures. He reduced the Order of <hi>Gramont,</hi> which had been corrupted by ſome factious fellows, into a better form, by taking away ſuch things as might be inconvenient, and adding other things that might keep up the Grandeur of Religion. He loved the Church of <hi>Saragoza</hi> ſo well that he made the City a <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> and aſſigned it the Covernment of five Cathedrals out of eleven, which were under the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Tarragona.</hi> He alſo created a new Order of Knights, to fight under Chriſt's Banner in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and oppoſe the <hi>Saracens</hi> in <hi>Granada</hi> and <hi>Africa. Boetica</hi> was the old name for <hi>Granada,</hi> which lies to the <hi>Mediteranean,</hi> and is ſo called, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, from the abundance it yields of a ſort of Grain that Dyers uſe. Now the Head-quarters of this Order, which the Pope conſtituted, was in a Seaport Town in the <hi>Dioceſe</hi> of <hi>Sylva</hi>; and the Knights had all the Templers goods by conſent of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> that they might be more at leiſure to fight for Chriſt. Their Cenſor and Moderator is the Abbot of a Monaſtery of <hi>Ciſtercians</hi> at <hi>Alcoaſia</hi> in the Dioceſe of <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi> who has the Power to liſt and disband a Knight as he pleaſes, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he made two S. <hi>Thomaſes</hi>; that is to ſay <hi>Thomas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford,</hi> a man of a great Family, a good Life, extraordinary Learning, and famous for his Miracles; and <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> a celebrated Doctor of the Order of S. <hi>Dominick,</hi> of whoſe Life and Writings I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made ſeveral Remarks. Not long after, he created ſeven Cardinals at a ſecond Ordination, in the year 1322: and preſently thereupon he ſet forth an Edict, to declare all thoſe for obſtinate Hereticks, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd that Chriſt and his Diſciples had nothing which they could call their own. Which certainly does not much agree with the Scripture, that tells us in many places, how Chriſt, his Diſciples and true follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had a real propriety in nothing: as in that paſſage of the Goſpel, where it ſays; He that does not ſell all that he has and give to the Poor, cannot be my Diſciple. Nay more than that, He accounted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one an Heretick, that ſaid the Diſciples as ſuch had not Power to ſell, to give, to bequeath, and to get, becauſe when they enter'd into Religion, they were to be under the Will of another. Which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Slaves do not gain any thing for themſelves but their Maſter, or give the Poor what they formerly got, if he command them. And of theſe Poſitions he ſent Apoſtolical Tranſcripts to all publick Schools, that the Scholars might not dare to Diſpute of that matter any more. Moreover he condemned the Opinion of one Frier <hi>Peter</hi> of the Order of <hi>Minors,</hi> who had animated a whole Convent of the third Order to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Chriſts poverty: of which number many were condemned and burnt. After that he made ten Cardinals more; among whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd <hi>John Columna</hi> and his Brother <hi>Matthew,</hi> who were of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> Family, and of the Order of <hi>Preachers.</hi> Whilſt the Pope was imploy'd in theſe Affairs, the <hi>Florentine</hi> Army was overcome in a bloody fight by <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gutio</hi> any longer, took an occaſion and turn'd <hi>Nerius</hi> his Son out of the City, whilſt he was going to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> a perſon of a Noble Family, and good courage; whom he had put in Priſon, that he might get the ſpoils which <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> had taken
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50681:172"/>
from the Enemies. <hi>Nerius</hi> being baniſh'd out of <hi>Lucca</hi> incenſed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt that State, upon whom thoſe of <hi>Piſa</hi> ſhut their Gates, as he was going out of the City to meet the Enemy. Upon that he and his Son eſcaped to <hi>Malaſpina,</hi> after he had often attempted, and been as often fruſtrated in the recovery of his Sovereignty; but by Command from the Pope he came back at laſt into <hi>Romagna</hi> which was his native Countrey. By this means <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> was promoted from extream mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to the greateſt happineſs: for he was taken out of Priſon and made ſole Governour of <hi>Lucca.</hi> But the Pope hearing that the <hi>Eſteſes</hi> had routed the Church Forces out of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and gotten it totally into their own hands; and that the Viſcounts, by aſſiſtance of <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> had made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Millain,</hi> he ſaid, he would let the <hi>Eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> alone for a while; but interdicted the <hi>Viſcounts,</hi> though he was not ſo angry with them as with <hi>Lewis,</hi> who uſurped the Title of Emperor. At the ſame time the <hi>Gibellins</hi> of <hi>Genoa</hi> were baniſh'd by their Fellow-Citizens the <hi>Guelphs</hi> aſſiſted by King <hi>Robert,</hi> to whom they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Government of their City, and fled in great numbers to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vona.</hi> But there too ſome time after, <hi>Robert</hi> perſecuted 'em every one in their Exile, and reduced the <hi>Savoneſes,</hi> as he went into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope underſtanding that the <hi>Guelphs</hi> were generally oppreſs'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Robert</hi>'s departure, ſent <hi>Charles,</hi> Earl of <hi>Valois,</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> to protect the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> and thoſe eſpecially that were at <hi>Vercelli</hi> with the <hi>Turrianoes,</hi> who were Lords of that City. But <hi>Viſcount Galeatius,</hi> by command from <hi>Lewis</hi> the Emperor, prevented <hi>Charles,</hi> and expelled the <hi>Turrianoes</hi> out of <hi>Vercelli</hi> before he came; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which that City became ſubject to the <hi>Viſcounts.</hi> Not long after <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> gets into <hi>Piſtoia,</hi> as <hi>Guido Petramala</hi> a little before had into <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherno,</hi> though the <hi>Florentines</hi> withſtood him. But <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> relying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the aid of <hi>Viſcount Galeatius</hi> (for he had ſent his Son <hi>Accio</hi> with one thouſand five hundred Soldiers to aſſiſt him) purſu'd and beat the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> back to the very Walls, killing a great many men. The Pope ſeeing the <hi>Bavarian</hi> reſolv'd to embroil all things interdicted him with the uſual Ceremonies; and degraded <hi>Guido Petramala</hi> from the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, after he had got poſſeſſion of <hi>Tipherno.</hi> He alſo ſeparated <hi>Corto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> from the Biſhoprick of <hi>Arezzo</hi> and made it a City of it ſelf, making <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Viterbo</hi> Biſhop of it. In the mean time <hi>Nicolas d' Eſte,</hi> Lord of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> ſtorm'd and took <hi>Argenta,</hi> a Town belonging to the Church of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Paſſerino Bonacoſſio</hi> Lord of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who a little before had married <hi>Nicolas</hi>'s Siſter. Theſe two alſo joyn'd their Forces and attempted <hi>Bologna,</hi> but went off with great loſs, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by <hi>Beltrando</hi> who commanded the Church-forces, and not long after curſed by the Pope. <hi>Ferraria</hi> too was interdicted, till they reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Argenta</hi>—. But <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> at that time did torment the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> after he had taken <hi>Segna,</hi> from whence he made frequent Sallies upon them, inſomuch that, deſpairing of their Affairs, they called in <hi>Charles,</hi> the Son of <hi>Robert</hi> to be their Covernour. At that time Pope <hi>John</hi> ſent <hi>John <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> with all ſpeed, to animate the <hi>Florentines</hi> and the <hi>Guelphs</hi> againſt the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> who was then coming over the <hi>Alps</hi> with a mighty Army. But he, in his way to <hi>Rome,</hi> went firſt to <hi>Millain,</hi> at the earneſt requeſt of the <hi>Gibellins.</hi> Where having received his Iron Crown, he wanted Money, and was forced to raiſe ſome upon
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:50681:173"/>
the people; which <hi>Galeatius</hi> their Governour making ſome ſcruple of, he put all the <hi>Viconti</hi> in Priſon, and choſe four and twenty Citizens to manage the publick Affairs, with a chief Officer of his own Family. Afterward the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>Caſtruccio,</hi> ſet all the <hi>Viconti</hi> at liberty, whilſt they were at <hi>Lucca,</hi> where the Emperor was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd with great reſpect and kindneſs. And when he went from thence, he was attended to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> with one thouſand five hundred Horſe: where in the Palace of S. <hi>Giovanni Laterano</hi> he was Crown'd by <hi>Stephano Columna</hi> at the command of the Clergy and People. At that time there were two chief Officers in the City, choſen out of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which they called the Emperors Lieutenants: and one of 'em, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Nicolas di Conti</hi> being then abſent, it fell to <hi>Stephano</hi>'s lot to do that Office. Being Crown'd Emperor, he preſently made <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Corbiere,</hi> of the Order of <hi>Minors,</hi> born near <hi>Rieti,</hi> Pope (to Rival <hi>John</hi> the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty third) who was a man of mean Birth, but a learned Man and very fit for buſineſs. This Perſon had a Wife formerly, againſt whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and inclination he enter'd into the Order of S. <hi>Francis.</hi> So being made a mock-Pope and called by the name of <hi>Nicolas</hi> the fifth, he was ſaluted by the Emperor and all that were there along with him, as the true Vicar of Chriſt; who likewiſe made Cardinals and Biſhops of men like himſelf—. In the mean time the <hi>French</hi> Horſe that were left in Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon at <hi>Florence,</hi> having ſurpriſed <hi>Piſtoia</hi> in the Night, they forc'd <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruccio</hi> to depart immediately from <hi>Rome.</hi> Who having firſt joyned the <hi>Viconti</hi>'s forces, came to <hi>Lucca</hi> and <hi>Piſa,</hi> and thence moving toward <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoia</hi> he beſieged it a long time, and at laſt compelled it to ſurrender for want of Proviſions. But the <hi>Bavarian</hi> followed <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> with an Army, and left the Anti-Pope at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> having a Deſign to ſtorm <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> And perhaps he had taken it, if <hi>Caſtruccio</hi> had not happen'd to die of a Diſeaſe which he contracted by the exceſſive pains that he took. Yet the <hi>Bavarian</hi> forgot his great kindneſs to him, and baniſh'd his Sons from <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Lucca,</hi> as they were diſpoſing of Soldiers to guard the ſeveral Cities; and took poſſeſſion of the Towns. At the ſame time <hi>Galeatius</hi> alſo dying, his Sons ſled to the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> deſiring him, that he would reſtore 'em to their Countrey for ſuch a ſum as they promiſed him. He thereupon, being very greedy of Money, ſent <hi>Accio</hi> home, but kept his Brother, <hi>Marco</hi> for an hoſtage till the whole Money was paid. And then, leaving the Anti-Pope at <hi>Piſa,</hi> with <hi>Viſcount Marco,</hi> he went to <hi>Millain,</hi> in order to go for <hi>Germany,</hi> but could not be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the City by <hi>Accio,</hi> who too well remember'd the injuries done to his Father. But the <hi>German</hi> Soldiers who kept <hi>Marco</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> for an Hoſtage, when they knew his good temper, ſwore Allegiance to him, and made him of their Priſoner, their Captain, ſo that he was ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Maſter of <hi>Lucca,</hi> by the ſurrender of <hi>Caſtruccio</hi>'s Soldiers, who gave up the Caſtle into his hands. And yet not long after the <hi>Germans,</hi> in <hi>Marco</hi>'s abſence, changed their mind and ſold the City of <hi>Lucca</hi> to a certain <hi>Genoeſe</hi> of the Family of <hi>Spinola,</hi> a great Seaman. So that after all, the <hi>Bavarian</hi> return'd to <hi>Germany,</hi> without having perform'd any thing to the advantage of the Empire; and <hi>Boniface</hi> Earl of <hi>Piſa,</hi> to gratifie Pope <hi>John,</hi> brought the Anti-Pope to <hi>Avignion,</hi> where he died in Priſon.

In the mean while the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes of <hi>Eſte</hi> were not abſolv'd from the Eccleſiaſtical Interdiction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were tired by the Petitions of thoſe of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and reſtored <hi>Argenta,</hi> which they were poſſeſſed of, to the Church of <hi>Ravenna.</hi> Yet ſtill, relying upon the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Scaligeri,</hi> they attaqu'd the Caſtle of S. <hi>Felix</hi> in <hi>Modena</hi>; till <hi>Charles,</hi> the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi>'s Son, came upon them, with <hi>Manfred,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Pius,</hi> who was Lord of <hi>Carpo,</hi> and by theſe two Confederates, they were routed and beaten out of the Field.

So that in the ſeventh month of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of his own accord, without any bodies knowledg, on a dark Night he went diſguiſed from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Bohemia</hi> to <hi>Charles,</hi> the Son of <hi>John</hi>; whom <hi>Clement</hi> a little before had made the Electors put in nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Emperor, becauſe he was ſo fine a Scholar; beſides, that he had a mind to affront the <hi>Bavarian</hi> by ſetting up a Competitor.

Nor is that any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for there was ſuch a concourſe of men from all places to <hi>Rome</hi> at the Jubilee, which was then celebrated, that they not onely brought the Contagion along with 'em, but by the throng and buſtle and ſweating that was among 'em, infected all places and perſons. At that time the Town of <hi>Colle</hi> and <hi>Geminiano</hi> were made ſubject to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and <hi>Bologna</hi> to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Millain,</hi> by the voluntary ſurrender of the Citizens.

Then was <hi>Guido Jordan</hi> made ſole Senator for a year by Apoſtolical Authority. About that time the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror who was Son to the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> was very kindly entertain'd by the <hi>Carrariens,</hi> the <hi>Gonziacks,</hi> and <hi>Viconti,</hi> and receiv'd his Iron Crown, as the cuſtom is, at <hi>Millain.</hi> And going from thence to <hi>Piſa,</hi> was met by Embaſſadors from the <hi>Sieneſes,</hi> from thoſe of <hi>Volaterra,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who told him they were ready to obey his Commands.

But <hi>Giles,</hi> having quieted <hi>Romagna,</hi> was ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Forli</hi> that he laid up not onely the Treaſure of the Church, but alſo all the money which was ſent from <hi>Avignion</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> to build Caſtles in that Town, and made ſome Ordinances which the Province uſes to this Day. But when <hi>Giles</hi> had ſetled <hi>Italy,</hi> and built a great many very neceſſary Forts in the Church Dominions, and reduced all the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes and States to Obedience, he had a Succeſſor in the fifth year of his Embaſſy, called <hi>Arduinus</hi> a <hi>Burgundian,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteaux,</hi> a man not at all fit for buſineſs. Wherefore when <hi>Giles</hi> was gone, all the Princes and States of <hi>Italy</hi> took up Arms. For the <hi>Piſans</hi> did ſo moleſt the <hi>Florentines,</hi> that, ſeeing no body durſt oppoſe 'em, they plunder'd all the Country of <hi>Florence,</hi> and took <hi>Figino</hi> a Caſtle lying up the River <hi>Arno,</hi> burning all the Villages which were built thereabout. At that time <hi>Pandulphus Malateſta</hi> was Captain General of the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Army, whom the people forced to relinquiſh his civil Government, becauſe he had never ſhewn that he had courage enough to engage
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50681:178"/>
with an Enemy. But the <hi>Piſans</hi> were then much higher than before; not ſo much out of any hope they had of taking the City, as that they ſhould bring a ſcandal upon it, and therefore after ſome light Skirmiſhes before the Gates, they return'd home with great ſpoils, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Autumn.</hi> And <hi>Bernabos</hi> alſo demoliſhed many Caſtles in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna</hi> (which was now haraſs'd with War) though the Abbot of <hi>Clugny</hi> defended it ſtoutly. <hi>Bologna,</hi> as I told you before, was ſubject to the <hi>Viconti</hi>; but <hi>Aulegianus</hi> betray'd it to the Abbot of <hi>Clugny,</hi> and was to have <hi>Fermo</hi> as the reward of his Treachery. But whilſt that <hi>Berna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos</hi> made War upon <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Reggio,</hi> the Apoſtolical Legate makes an Alliance with <hi>Philippino Gonzaga, Canes</hi> of <hi>Verona,</hi> and <hi>Nicolas d' Eſte</hi> to go againſt the <hi>Breſcians.</hi> Then <hi>Bernabos,</hi> being concern'd for the danger which thoſe of <hi>Breſcia</hi> were in, left <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Reggio,</hi> and march'd toward the Enemy, but was ſo defeated at <hi>Montclere,</hi> that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he could hardly defend the very Walls of the City. About the ſame time the <hi>Florentines</hi> overcame the <hi>Piſans,</hi> under the command of <hi>Galeot Malateſta,</hi> by corrupting their Soldiers to come over to their Party. For this reaſon the <hi>Piſans</hi> laid all the fault upon the <hi>Cambacur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> who were eminent Citizens there, becauſe they paid the Soldiers covetouſly and ſtingily; and therefore recall'd <hi>John Agnellus</hi> who was baniſh'd, as being a friend to <hi>Bernabos,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Cambacurti:</hi> and he in a little time reduced the City, and made it acknowledg him for their Governour, having removed all the friends of the adverſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But when the Pope had made a Peace between the <hi>Piſans</hi> and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> one <hi>John Haucut</hi> who had been uſed to fight under the <hi>Piſans,</hi> got together all the Soldiers in <hi>Italy,</hi> and gave all people oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to fear; eſpecially ſince <hi>Rome</hi> was in ſuch an uproar at the chooſing of Senators. But <hi>Innocent</hi> eaſily appeaſed their Diſcords by ſending a forein Senator to 'em, called <hi>Raimund Ptolomy,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Siena,</hi> who bore that Office a whole year, and that was in the year 1359. But though things were ſetled in this manner, yet the <hi>Romans</hi> could not be quiet. For they turn'd out their Senator, and created ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Citizens with Sovereign Power whom they called the Reformers of the whole Republick. Upon this account <hi>Innocent</hi> made <hi>Hugo Luſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naneus,</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> (who was going then to War againſt the Turks) Senator, and commanded totally to aboliſh that Society of Reformers. But he, at that time, was very intent upon making an end of the War betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> that all might go againſt the Turk. But when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had overcome the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Poictou,</hi> and had taken their King with <hi>Philip</hi> his Son, they were thought to have done a great exploit: yet at the ſame time <hi>Edward,</hi> out of his Princely generoſity, gives all the Captives their Liberty, upon condition, that they would never fight againſt him more. But they ſoon after broke thoſe terms of Peace, and forced <hi>Edward</hi> to reſume his Arms and beſiege <hi>Paris. Innocent</hi> deſign'd alſo to prepare a Navy againſt the Infidels, when at the ſame time the <hi>Piſans,</hi> who were excellent Seamen, and the <hi>Venetiano</hi> that had a great Navy, were at War, the former with the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the latter with <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> For that King did then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Treviſo</hi> with a great Army; beſides that the <hi>Venetians</hi> were at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance among themſelves. For <hi>Marino</hi> their General being accuſed, as if he aſpired to Sovereignty, was beheaded. <hi>Innocent</hi> being thus diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:50681:178"/>
in his mind, he died in the ninth year, eighth month, and ſixth day of his Pontificate, juſt about the ſame time with <hi>Bartholus Saxofer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi> the wiſeſt man in all that Age. But before the Popes death there was ſuch an Eclipſe of the Sun, as never was before: wherefore all people thought that ſuch a great Man could not die, but even the Planets would give ſome preſages of his departure.</p>

Nor was that all, but the Enemy took <hi>Andrew Pepulo</hi> a <hi>Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Banditto, Synebald Ordelaphus, Paulus Mirandula, Guido Foliano, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi> of <hi>Corrigia, William Cavalcabos,</hi> the moſt Signal Commanders of the Army. But the Kings of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus</hi> were concern'd at the misfortune of the <hi>Viconti</hi> and ſent Embaſſadours to <hi>Giles,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him, that he would make Peace with them. Which Embaſſadours were not ſent in vain; for a Peace was concluded, though it were of no long continuance. For <hi>John Hawkwood,</hi> on the behalf of the <hi>Viconti,</hi> having engaged the <hi>Florentines,</hi> routed their Army at S. <hi>Miniato,</hi> which cauſed <hi>Giles,</hi> the Legate, to ſend <hi>Thomas Obicio</hi> an excellent Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with three thouſand Horſe, and a competent number of Foot to help the <hi>Florentines.</hi> They fought betwixt <hi>Arezzo</hi> and <hi>Cortona</hi> four hours together ſtoutly: but at length <hi>Thomas,</hi> chiefly with the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Infantry, gave the Enemy ſuch a blow, that of ſix thouſand Horſe, which fought under <hi>Hawkwood,</hi> few eſcaped, and the Captain himſelf yielded. Thoſe that had revolted from the Church when they heard of this great Victory, immediately ſurrender'd. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> then came into <hi>Italy,</hi> in the fourth year of his Pontificate to ſettle things, and <hi>Giles</hi> the Legate met him at <hi>Corneto</hi>; and rendring an account of what he had done was diſcharg'd from his Legateſhip; and the Pope going on his way from <hi>Corneto</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> he retired quietly in his old Age at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> where he died in three months after. He was a Man of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Virtue and Courage, and preſerv'd the Honour of the Church, whilſt he lived, moſt wonderfully.

But that he might not ſeem to conſult the good of his Kindred more than that of the Church, he ſent him to the beſt Maſters he could find for breeding, and eſpecially to <hi>Baldus,</hi> who at that time was a Profeſſor at <hi>Perugia.</hi> Under whom he made ſuch progreſs in all ſorts of Learning that <hi>Baldus</hi> often uſed his Authority to clear a Doubt. And then he was a Man of ſuch innocence, good nature, affability and piety, that he was generally beloved. At his entrance upon the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate this was the ſtate of things in <hi>Italy</hi>; at <hi>Rome</hi> the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice were held by Senators whom the Pope appointed for every ſix months, but the Guard of the City and all the management of publick Affairs were in the hands of the <hi>Bandereſii,</hi> ſo named from their <hi>Banners</hi> (a <hi>Teutonic</hi> word) which they uſed in War, by which every <hi>Decuria</hi> (now called <hi>Capo di Regione</hi> or Head of a Ward) was diſtinguiſh'd.

The Popes Legate was now come into <hi>Italy</hi> and had ſetled the ſtate of the Church, he made a Peace with the <hi>Viconti,</hi> when a new Tumult aroſe at <hi>Prato,</hi> which was the original of great confuſion. For the Inhabitants of <hi>Prato</hi> endeavouring to vindicate themſelves from the Dominion of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> called the Church Forces into <hi>Tuſcany</hi> by permiſſion from the Legate. But the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſo far corrupted them with money, that they enter'd <hi>Prato</hi> by their aſſiſtance, put the Conſpirators to death, and ſent a great many Banners, with <hi>Liberty</hi> written upon them, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Troops, to ſeveral Towns; exhorting the People, as their Lords, that they would remember the Liberty of the Church, and caſt off the yoke of Servitude. The firſt that revolted from the Church were the <hi>Caſtellani,</hi> then the <hi>Perugians,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Todi, Spoleto, Gubio, Viterbo, Forli,</hi> and <hi>Aſcoli</hi> follow'd their Example. At that time too <hi>Aſtorgius Manfred,</hi> under the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> having taſted the ſweetneſs of abſolute Dominion, had poſſeſs'd himſelf of <hi>Granariolo</hi> a Caſtle near <hi>Faenza:</hi> againſt whom the Legate ſent <hi>John Hawkwood</hi> with ſome Troops out of <hi>Bologna.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Bologna</hi> defended <hi>Aſtorgius,</hi> and keeping out <hi>Hawkwood</hi> with all his men, aſſerted their Liberty. But <hi>Hawkwood</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Faenzeſes</hi> ready to rebel, he not onely plunder'd the City ſeverely, and kill'd all that his Soldiers met, but he ſold the very ground on which it ſtood to <hi>Nicolas</hi> and <hi>Albert d' Eſte,</hi> two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for 20000 <hi>l.</hi> reſerving onely <hi>Bagnacavallo</hi> to himſelf, where the Carriages of his Army lay. The Pope hearing of ſuch great Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſent Cardinal <hi>Cevennes</hi> as his Legate with ſix thouſand <hi>Britiſh</hi> Horſe ito <hi>Italy</hi>; who coming down through <hi>Piedmont,</hi> march'd as far as the very Gates of <hi>Bologna</hi> without doing any hurt deſigning to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege the City. But when the Legate heard the <hi>Florentines</hi> were come to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Bolognians</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Rodolphus Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneo,</hi> he went with his Army, to Winter in <hi>Ceſena.</hi> In which City there was ſuch an upooar by reaſon of the pride of the <hi>French,</hi> that ſix hundred <hi>Britains</hi> were ſlain, and the reſt turn'd out of Town. But they got in again afterward by way of the Tower, and being increaſed in their number they fill'd all places with bloud and rapine, not ſparing even thoſe, whoſe very age made their excuſe: onely young Women and Maids were kept alive to be abuſed. But thoſe of <hi>Forli,</hi> fearing leſt for want of advice, and one to Govern them they might be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:50681:180"/>
by the Legate, they took <hi>Synebald, Pyne, John,</hi> and <hi>Theobald, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delaphi</hi> as their Lords into the City, and were bravely defended by them from the fury of the <hi>Britains.</hi> But Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> conceiving that all the miſchiefs of <hi>Italy</hi> proceeded from his being abſent, and that the long ſhipwrack of Affairs there happen'd becauſe the Pilot was out of the way, the good Man was very intent a good while upon a Journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy.</hi> But he was mightily concerned at a certain Biſhops words, who being asked by the Pope (as they were walking together) why he did not return to his Church, which he ought not to have left ſo long without a Paſtor? He reply'd, Why do not you that are the greateſt Biſhop, give a good Example and go to your own Biſhoprick at <hi>Rome?</hi> The Pope was diſturb'd at theſe words, and therefore he got ready one and twenty Ships in the <hi>Rhoan,</hi> under pretence of going elſewhere, that he might not be ſtop'd by the <hi>French,</hi> as he would have been, if they had underſtood he had been going to <hi>Rome:</hi> becauſe it was their Intereſt to keep the Court in <hi>France.</hi> Thereupon he went firſt to <hi>Genoa,</hi> and then to <hi>Corneto</hi>; from whence he went by Land (for he was weary of ſailing, in the Winter eſpecially) to <hi>Rome,</hi> and arrived there in the year 1376. about the 11. of <hi>January</hi> in the ſeventh year of his Pontificate, and the 70th year after the Court went out of <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> But what preparations the people of <hi>Rome</hi> made, and with what incredible joy they received him 'tis needleſs to relate; for all the Nobility went to meet him, with their countenances, geſtures and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations expreſſing all kind of pleaſure, as Children do that ſee their dear Father return'd from a ſtrange Country. And indeed all things lacked his preſence there. For both the Walls, the Churches and all buildings in general, publick or private, threatened nothing but ruin, till he repaired moſt part of them, as the Tower, which he built at S. <hi>Maries the Great</hi> does teſtifie. The morality alſo of the City was ſo decay'd, that they ſeemed to have nothing about 'em which look'd like a Citizen; but appeared as if they ought to go and learn manners, who formerly had reduced the whole to urbanity and good behaviour. So then the Pope, having ſeated himſelf in <hi>Rome</hi> (as a good Paſtor ſhould do) began to look about him, and think of a cure for the Wounds of <hi>Italy.</hi> And whilſt he was a ruminating of it, he conſider'd that nothing but a Peace could do the feat. Thereupon he ſent his Legate firſt to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who inclin'd to War, and perſuades 'em not to ſlight or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe any fair Conditions of Peace. They ſuſpecting the Popes power, and fearing leſt they ſhould be compell'd to make a Peace, enter into Alliance and Confederacy with <hi>Bernabos</hi> their old Enemy. After that they corrupted <hi>Haucut</hi> with money and fair promiſes to come over from the Church to their Party: at which they were ſo triumphant, and ſo proud, that they omitted no ſort of injury or Affront, that they could do the Pope. For which they were anathematized, and yet were ſo inſolent, that they forced their Prieſts, notwithſtanding the Interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to perform the Divine Offices againſt Law and Reaſon. The Pope therefore weary at laſt of intreating took up Arms, and having recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled <hi>Bologna,</hi> which was to be govern'd in his Name, he, like the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> before made <hi>Varraneo</hi> his ſtipendiary, and gave him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Church Army, to go againſt <hi>Florence.</hi> But a quarrel aroſe between the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> which put a ſtop to his Deſigns,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:50681:180"/>
he fearing, leſt any forein force ſhould invade <hi>Italy,</hi> if he ingaged with the <hi>Florentines</hi> himſelf. For whilſt <hi>Andronicus,</hi> by the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> aſſiſtance, to whom he had given <hi>Tenedo,</hi> as the reward of the Exploit, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned <hi>Charles</hi>'s Father, who was <hi>John,</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> reſtored him again to his Country, and had the Iſland <hi>Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> given to them by him. At which the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> were angry though they deferr'd their revenge till another occaſion, for fear of the Pope's Curſe, who threaten'd it to both parties, if they did not quit their Arms, not holding it fit for either of them to meddle in that War. But whilſt this holy Man did all things with that diligence that became a Pope, he dy'd of that intolerable pain, the ſtone in the Bladder, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth year, and fifth month of his Pontificate, the ſixteenth of <hi>April,</hi> in the year 1378. and was buried in S. <hi>Maries</hi> in the New Street, in a Marble Tomb, which is yet to be ſeen; and ſo much lamented as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man was before him. For all people thought themſelves deprived of a Father, in him; and did bewail not onely the preſent but their future Calamity, into which they were faln by the loſs of ſo good a Pope, and the Diſcords that aroſe among the chief Citizens.</p>

Alledging, that when the Pope was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, all the Country and City were continually embroil'd with Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, and Seditions; and that the Churches in <hi>Rome</hi> were ſo neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thereby grown ſo much out of order, that they were moſt of 'em ready to fall. And that, upon this account, the people who came con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to <hi>Rome</hi> were not ſo zealous as they uſed to be, when they ſaw the Papal Sea, the Cardinals Churches, and Monaſteries, nay the holy places where the Martyrs lie, without a Roof, and the Walls fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down, to let in ſheep and other Cattel. That it was fit the Pope ſhould live where <hi>Peter</hi> had placed the Pontifical Chair by the Will of God, out of his own Country and Nation, and advanced the honour of it by the aſhes and the blood of Martyrs, Confeſſors, and holy Popes. Hence might the Paſtors of the Church, if they were circumſpect and mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Chriſts Command, or incited by Example of thoſe whoſe Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Actions they had before their Eyes, conſult the Salvation of Mankind; and at the ſame time recover S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony, which had been ſeiſed by ſeveral Uſurpers in <hi>Tuſcany, Sabina, Campagna di Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Ombria, Millain,</hi> and <hi>Romagna,</hi> whilſt the Popes were abſent. That

they would not ſay for the preſent, how the piety of people was dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, and that their Pilgrimages to <hi>Rome,</hi> or to ſee the Bodies or Reliques of the Saints were much rarer than formerly, by reaſon of the Popes abſence; but that all theſe things might ſtill be reſtored, if an <hi>Italian</hi> were choſen Pope.

That they might go and be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that they would do nothing but what ſhould promote the glory of God, the good of the Church and of all Chriſtendom. So they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Conclave at S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and order'd a certain number of Guards to be in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> leſt any Tumult might hinder ſo important an Election; But when they came to Vote, there was a great debate all of a ſudden. For there were thirteen <hi>French</hi> Cardinals, who would have had a Pope choſen out of them; and four <hi>Italians,</hi> among whom one, that was of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> Family, did moſt aſpire to the Popedom. The <hi>French</hi> ſeem'd to have the better of it becauſe they had the Majority: but there hapning a quarrel betwixt thoſe of <hi>Limoſin</hi> and the other <hi>French</hi> Men, each ſide contending for the choice of a Pope out of their party, they choſe <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bari,</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> or, as others ſay, a <hi>Piſan,</hi> not of the Colledg of Cardinals, and in his abſence, by the name of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Sixth. But before they appear'd abroad, or that it was known, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> was made Pope; the <hi>French</hi> ſcandalized the Election, as extorted by fraud and fear, whilſt the <hi>Romans</hi> urged them with force and Arms to chuſe an <hi>Italian.</hi> So that the Cardinals when they came out of the Conclave, fled partly into <hi>Caſtel S.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> alſo went to <hi>Vicovaro,</hi> having great hopes of getting the Pontificate in a time of ſuch Diſcord. But not long after the Cardinals repented, and came to the City, where they confirm'd <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> whom they had formerly choſen, ſaluting him, according to the dignity of a true Pope. Three months after the <hi>French</hi> Party pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the City was too hot for 'em, and deſired of the Pope, that he would give 'em leave to go to <hi>Anagni,</hi> for change of Air, which in the City was peſtilent, eſpecially in the Summer, and to <hi>French</hi> Conſtitutions; though they indeed were affraid of his ſeverity, and ſo were deſirous to get out of the way. For he had often called 'em to him and admoniſhed them, to keep their hands clean, and receive no bribes nor rewards for pleading in behalf of others, or doing any man a kindneſs that ſhould ask it: And told 'em, that he would puniſh them ſeverely that he found guilty of Simony, or promoting unjuſt Suits. Beſides he told 'em that he ſhould be pleaſed, and was very deſirous, that they would omit ſome of their State, and ſuch a train of Servants and Horſes, for what they ſpent in ſuch vanity was really due to the Poor, or ought to have been employ'd toward the repairs of tottering Churches. He told 'em, that he would chuſe good men to be about his own perſon, and that he would make the wicked ſuffer for their offences, unleſs they mended their manners. And becauſe he heard that the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals did talk once, as if the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would go back into their Countrey, he told 'em publickly that he would ſtay at <hi>Rome,</hi> and would not hearken to any one that ſhould perſuade him to remove from it, becauſe, as he
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:50681:181"/>
ſaid, the foundation of the univerſal Church, and of Chriſtian Faith, was laid at <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the ſuperſtructure raiſed in the ſame place. The <hi>French</hi> Cardinals were moved with theſe Reaſons, and eſpecially thoſe, who had robbed the Church Treaſury upon the Death of ſeveral Popes, and done what they pleaſed; they fled firſt to <hi>Anagni,</hi> next to <hi>Fondi,</hi> where they inveigh'd againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> as a falſe Pope, and ſaid he was made by force, and received his Crown by force, becauſe that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Coronation was not in a place at all ſafe, where peoples Wills and Votes might be free, but that on the contrary, they were forced to chuſe an <hi>Italian</hi> rather than a <hi>French</hi> man. For theſe Reaſons, the Sea (as they ſaid) being vacant, they (who were eight in all) by the permiſſion and favour of Queen <hi>Joan,</hi> choſe Cardinal <hi>Cevennes,</hi> who had been Legate in <hi>Italy</hi>; and called him <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh. Hence aroſe a great and a long quarrel in the Church of God, which they call a <hi>Schiſm</hi>; when part of the Chriſtian Princes favour'd <hi>

At that time alſo the <hi>Marcheſi</hi> of <hi>Carreto,</hi> by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabos</hi> took <hi>Albenga, Noli,</hi> and <hi>Caſtel Franco</hi> from the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> but not long after they made a Peace with 'em and reſtored all. After this the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> put <hi>Dominick Fregoſo</hi> their Duke into Priſon, with his Brother <hi>Peter,</hi> and made <hi>Nicolas Gualch</hi> their Governour by Land, and <hi>Lucian Auria</hi> their Admiral by Sea.

died, in the year 1379. and almoſt all the Dutchy of <hi>Millain</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be for <hi>Bernabos</hi>: at which the <hi>Venetians</hi> were much pleaſed, but to no purpoſe; for firſt the half, and then the whole Country fell off to <hi>John Galeatius</hi> his Nephew. <hi>Lucian,</hi> Admiral of the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving toward <hi>Pola,</hi> conquer'd and took the <hi>Venetian</hi> Navy in the very Harbour: but, whilſt he purſu'd the Enemy too raſhly, he was run through with a Lance and died. Both the Navies, as well the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, as the conquered, were brought into <hi>Zara,</hi> whither the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> ſent <hi>Peter Auria</hi> in the room of his deceaſed Brother, with nine Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, and many other Veſſels: who taking an account of his Brothers Victory, found two thouſand Captives, beſide the multitudes that were kill'd and drown'd. The <hi>Venetians</hi> were attaqued at Land too by <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> and his Allies, whom I have mention'd, to whom the <hi>Venetians</hi> oppoſed <hi>Albrico Barbiano</hi> Earl of <hi>Cuni,</hi> an excellent Commander. But <hi>Peter Auria</hi> having gotten a Navy of ſixty Galleys, and as many other Veſſels, went to <hi>Venice,</hi> ſtorm'd and burn'd <hi>Grado, Comachio,</hi> and <hi>Cahorle.</hi> From thence he went to <hi>Chioza,</hi> which though it were defended for ſome time by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> yet he took it at laſt, by aſſiſtance of Supplies, which he had from the Governour of <hi>Padua.</hi> 'Tis certain that full ſix thouſand men were ſlain in that Siege, and nine hundred and fifty of the <hi>Venetians</hi> taken, and ſent to <hi>Zara</hi>; they ſpared the Women, not violating their Chaſtity in all their fury and violence. The <hi>Venetians</hi> being quite diſheartened at this Calamity, and deſpairing of any help by Sea or Land, ſet the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Captives at liberty, and ſent 'em to <hi>Chioza</hi> to their Admiral, to beg their pardon, and to make their ſubmiſſion to the Will of the Conqueror; But the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> proud of their Victory, as Conquerors uſe to be, refuſed to anſwer the <hi>Venetians,</hi> unleſs they would come and ſurrender themſelves and all they had. Thereupon the <hi>Venetians</hi> betook themſelves to the defence of their Country, and ſetting up Chains of Iron before the Ports mouth, and a Guard of three hundred Horſe with as many Foot upon the Key; they ſought out for ſome one perſon, whom they might make their General. And being in great doubt by reaſon of their Diſtractions whom to chuſe, it was propoſed by ſome body, that Victor of <hi>Piſa</hi> was the onely man fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be in a place of that Truſt, as well underſtanding the Power and Arts of the <hi>Genoeſes.</hi> That Voice (whoever ſpoke) was heard with great reverence, as if it came from an Oracle: for immediately they ran all to the Priſon, where he lay for his ill management at <hi>Pola,</hi> and taking him out made him their ſole Commander. The <hi>Genoeſes</hi> by that time were come very near, and having taken all the Caſtles thereabout, were juſt entering the City; but were eaſily repulſed after a long fight by <hi>John Barbadicus</hi> with certain ſmall Ships well arm'd, the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Galleys not being able to come on, in thoſe narrow Seas. Beſides, <hi>Barbadicus</hi> uſed this other Stratagem. There was at that time an Inſtrument, called <hi>Bombarda,</hi> i.e. a Gun, newly invented by a certain <hi>German,</hi> and called <hi>Bombarda</hi> from its thundering ſound; and each of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Skiffs had two of thoſe Guns or more, whereby the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> who were ignorant and unskill'd in this new kind of fighting, were many of 'em deſtroy'd; each Gun often killing two or three men at one ſhot, becauſe they were not able to avoid them ſo well on board as if they had been on ſhoar. Hereupon the <hi>Venetians</hi> bad <hi>Bernabos Viconti</hi> their friend
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:50681:182"/>
and Ally, to preſs upon the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> ſo as to raiſe their Siege; they already wanting proviſions. And indeed the <hi>Venetians</hi> muſt have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, if (as <hi>Carrara</hi> adviſed, the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> had taken care to hinder ſupplies from being imported into <hi>Venice. Bernabos,</hi> to give ſome ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſent his Army againſt the <hi>Genoeſes</hi>; who when they had plunder'd the Valley of <hi>Pulcephera</hi> and taken nineteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, they left the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> (who fought againſt <hi>Bernabos</hi> not with Swords but with Gold,) and having loaded themſelves with Spoil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd into <hi>Millain. Aſtorgius</hi> of <hi>Faenza</hi> had not ſo good luck, when he was ſent thither, by <hi>Bernabos,</hi> with the Horſe. For coming toward the City he was routed by the people of <hi>Genoa</hi> who ſallied out upon him, but eſcaped with much ado himſelf in the habit of a Country Fellow. But <hi>Calo John</hi> Emperor of <hi>Greece,</hi> being an Ally of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Pera,</hi> a Place belonging to the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> over againſt <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> For he ſaw the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> were engaged in many and dangerous Wars. But <hi>Andronicus</hi> his Son, who was an equal Enemy to his Father and the <hi>Venetian</hi> both, with the aſſiſtance of the Turks and <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſtoutly, and frighted his Father to that degree, that he ſoon after came over to the ſide of the <hi>Genoeſes.</hi> In the mean time <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> was not ſo intent upon making Peace between Chriſtians (which he ſhould have done) as he was deſirous to revenge the injuries which he received from Queen <hi>Joan,</hi> and therefore incited <hi>Lewis,</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his Brother <hi>Andrea</hi>'s death and he would help him. He conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by inſtigating <hi>Charles</hi> his Son (who was then carrying on the War againſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> in <hi>Marca Treviſana</hi>) againſt <hi>Joan,</hi> he gave the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſome little reſpit, who before that were almoſt ruined. And it added ſomewhat to their Affairs that <hi>Charles Zenus</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Sea-man ſunk two Ships of Burthen in the Port of <hi>Chioza,</hi> and reduced the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> to that extremity, that they themſelves (ſince all other Paſſes were ſtopp'd up, and they could not bring their Ships out) ſeemed rather to be beſieged than to beſiege, they were in ſuch neceſſity of all proviſions. But nothing did the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> ſo much injury, as the death of <hi>Peter Auria</hi> who was kill'd by a ſhot from a Gun, as he was ſtoutly defending the Fortifications of <hi>Chioza.</hi> In whoſe place <hi>Matthew Ruffus</hi> was preſently choſen, who, as he was coming to <hi>Chioza</hi> with new Galleys, took <hi>Thaddeus Juſtinianus</hi> at <hi>Manfredonia,</hi> with ſix Galleys la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Proviſions. <hi>Agapetus,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Columna,</hi> being concern'd for theſe misfortunes, exhorted the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> to Peace very often, but all in vain: for they, who fought out of hatred, not for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, would never hearken to the wholeſom advice of thoſe who gave 'em good Counſel. At length the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> when they ſaw themſelves ſo begirt at <hi>Chioza,</hi> that they could not ſally forth for the <hi>Venetian,</hi> nor get proviſions from <hi>Matthew Ruffus,</hi> or the Lord of <hi>Padua,</hi> who had promiſed them ſhortly to ſupply them, they ſurrender'd the Town on the firſt of <hi>July</hi> 1380. At which time there were taken of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my 4340. though more died in the Siege by Famine and the Sword. Yet the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> though they had receiv'd ſuch a fatal blow, could not lie ſtill, but with thirty eight Galleys compelled the <hi>Trieſteſes</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from the <hi>Venetians</hi> to the Patriarch of <hi>Aquilegia.</hi> They likewiſe took <hi>Juſtinople,</hi> but not the Caſtle. And when they had recruited their Navy they went for <hi>Venice</hi> again; but no body encountring them, they return'd
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:50681:183"/>
into <hi>Iſtria,</hi> took the City <hi>Pola</hi> and burn'd it: Many ſlaughters followed on both ſides. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> were overcome in a Land fight by <hi>Carrara,</hi> whilſt <hi>James Caballus</hi> an excellent Commander, defended <hi>Treviſo</hi> ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which was almoſt forc'd by Famine to a ſurrender. And now both ſides being well tired with ſuch a long and bloody War, the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> upon the 23d of <hi>September,</hi> 1381. makes Peace between them upon theſe terms; that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> every tenth year, ſhould pay the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſeven thouſand pounds, provided he kept all his part of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> free from Pirates, and ſuffer no Salt to be made in his Dominions there; and that the Patriarch of <hi>Aquilegia</hi> ſhould have the ſame Power in <hi>Friuli</hi> as before the War. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> were order'd, to ſend home each others Captives, without any mention of the Spoils which were taken on either ſide. The <hi>Padueſes</hi> were commanded to draw off from the Siege of <hi>Treviſo</hi>; and to demoliſh the Towers, and Forts which they had raiſed in Fens, and at the mouths of ſeveral Rivers; upon which account bounds were ſet out between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Padua.</hi> In the mean while <hi>Charles</hi> whom we told you the Pope ſent for out of <hi>Hungary</hi> to go againſt <hi>Joan,</hi> came into <hi>Italy</hi> with eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and firſt reduced <hi>Arezzo,</hi> which had been long embroiled by the ſeditions of the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibellins.</hi> From thence moving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Florence,</hi> he was repell'd by <hi>John Hawkwood</hi> who at that time quarter'd at <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> went into his Kingdom, and having conquer'd all <hi>Joans</hi> Forces, took <hi>Naples</hi> by ſurrender. The Queen was beſieged in <hi>Caſtelnovo,</hi> when the <hi>Guelphs</hi> of <hi>Arezzo</hi> made a Tumult and forced <hi>James Caracciolo</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Naples</hi> who was ſent thither by the King, to fly into the Caſtle. The <hi>Gibellins</hi> alſo fled thither too, whoſe good that juſt Man conſulted as much as the <hi>Guelphs.</hi> For he deſired to carry every thing alike with equity in all caſes. Wherefore having ſent for <hi>Albrick Barbianus</hi> from <hi>Todi</hi> upon the account of an injury which he reviv'd, he went into the City, and whilſt he ſtrove to reduce the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> he plunder'd the <hi>Gibellins</hi> alſo. And <hi>Ferraback</hi> another Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral who follow'd <hi>Albrick</hi> took all the remaining ſpoil that he could find in <hi>Arezzo.</hi> Whilſt theſe things were tranſacted in <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Arezzo,</hi> a new cloud of War overcaſt Italy.

The <hi>Gibellins</hi> defended the Caſtle, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged

forty days, and had been taken by the <hi>French,</hi> had not <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Anjou</hi> died in the mean time. Then <hi>Andegranius,</hi> ſeeing how things went, by advice of the people of <hi>Arezzo,</hi> that were beſieged in the Caſtle, ſold the City to the <hi>Florentines</hi>; and ſo return'd into <hi>France.</hi> And the <hi>Anjouen</hi> Soldiers now deſtitute of their General, wandered home by two or three in a Company begging by the way. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> being now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from the fear of the <hi>French,</hi> went to <hi>Naples,</hi> and as'd leave of the King, to make his Nephew Prince of <hi>Campania,</hi> which when he could not obtain, being of a clowniſh and uncivil temper, (which he would have had to be interpreted a blunt down-right honeſty) he began to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him, and provoked the King ſo far, that he ſet a Guard upon him for ſome days, and would not ſuffer him to walk the Streets. This af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front he ſeemed to wink at for a time, and with the Kings good leave went to <hi>Nocera,</hi> to avoid (as he himſelf ſaid) the heat of that City. Where when he had fortified the Town he made ſome new Cardinals, and impriſon'd ſeven of the old ones, charging upon them a Conſpiracy with the King and the Anti-Pope againſt him. Beſides that He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Proceſs (to ſpeak in their phraſe) againſt the King, and ſent him a Citation to appear: and had this anſwer from him, That he would come very ſhortly to <hi>Nocera,</hi> and acquit himſelf of all Crimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected not with Words but with Weapons. And in order thereunto he came to <hi>Nocera</hi> with a competent Army, and beſieged the Town. But <hi>Raymund Balcianus,</hi> of the Family of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſins,</hi> and Son to the Earl of <hi>Nola</hi> (who was afterward Prince of <hi>Taranto</hi>) was concern'd at the indignity, with his own Forces, which he commanded under the King, he carried <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> and the whole Court to the next Shore, and put 'em on board certain <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Galleys prepared for the purpoſe. By the way as the Pope ſailed to <hi>Genoa,</hi> he took ſeven Cardinals at <hi>Nocera,</hi> of which he put five into Baggs and drowned them in the Sea. But upon the death of <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> the Nobility of that Country ſent preſently for <hi>Charles:</hi> who going thither called a Convention of the Eſtates for the ſetling of Affairs, but whilſt he was buſie upon it, the Queen who ow'd him a grudg procur'd him to be murther'd, in the year 1385. This was juſt about the time, when <hi>John Galeatius</hi> put Viſcount <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabos</hi> (his Uncle by the ſide of his Father <hi>Galeatius</hi>) into Priſon at <hi>Monza,</hi> where he kept him as long as he liv'd, and enjoy'd his Eſtate. For formerly when they divided their Patrimony, <hi>Pavia, Vercelli, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vara, Tortona, Aleſſandria,</hi> and other places toward the <hi>Apennine</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and the <hi>Alps,</hi> fell to <hi>Galeatius</hi>; and <hi>Piacenza, Cremona, Parma, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Breſcia,</hi> and <hi>Pergamo,</hi> to <hi>Bernabos; Millain</hi> being common to both. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> had now paſs'd a whole year at <hi>Genoa,</hi> when news was brought him that the <hi>Florentines</hi> incited the Cities belonging to the Church to aſſert their Liberty, as they had done formerly; upon which he went firſt to <hi>Lucca,</hi> and then to <hi>Siena</hi> and <hi>Perugia:</hi> And thoſe Cities being confirm'd in their Allegiance by his coming, he went as far as <hi>Feren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino</hi> under pretence of ſeeing <hi>Naples</hi>; but his true Deſign was, to turn <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> a very Child, and <hi>John,</hi> both Sons to <hi>Charles,</hi> out of their paternal Inheritance. For many Noblemen, that favour'd <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> gave him hope of enjoying that Kingdom; but thoſe of <hi>Gajetta</hi> were very faithful, and preſerving the Children alive, ſaved the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom too to their great Honour. The Pope therefore return'd to <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:50681:184"/>
not being able to effect his Deſign, but was receiv'd into the City with great pomp; though not long after the <hi>Bandereſii</hi> laid wait for him, which yet he eſcaped, and fruſtrated. He created in one day twenty nine Cardinals, of which three were <hi>Romans,</hi> the reſt almoſt all <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans.</hi> In the mean while <hi>Antonius Scala</hi> of <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Lord of <hi>Padua,</hi> were engaged in a bloody War, in which <hi>John <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

The <hi>Florentines</hi> alſo willing now to encreaſe their Dominions, took <hi>Monte-Pulciano</hi> and <hi>Luſignano,</hi> two Towns in the Territories of <hi>Siena,</hi> by Stratagem rather than by ſtrength; And afterward ſent <hi>Charles,</hi> Son to <hi>Bernabos,</hi> and <hi>Antony Scala</hi> with five thouſand Horſe into the Country of <hi>Siena</hi> to forage. This mov'd <hi>Galeatius</hi> to ſuch a degree, that he diſpatch'd Embaſſadors to <hi>Florence</hi> to complain, that contrary to the League heretofore made between them, the <hi>Florentines</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd in pay his Enemies, <hi>Charles Viconti</hi> and <hi>Antony Scala</hi>; and that againſt all right and juſtice they had haraſs'd his Friends and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the <hi>Sienneſes:</hi> In fine, his Embaſſadors were commanded, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare War againſt them, except they drew off their Forces from the <hi>Siennois,</hi> and disbanded thoſe Officers. But leſt <hi>Galeatius</hi> ſhould have been as good as his word, <hi>Peter Gambacorta</hi> Lord of <hi>Piſa,</hi> a Friend both to him and to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> interpoſed, and undertook to make up the buſineſs.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>ONIFACE</hi> the Ninth, a <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> formerly called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tomacello,</hi> was made Pope at <hi>Rome</hi> by general conſent of the Cardinals, in the year 1389. Who though he were not above thirty years old, when he enter'd upon the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet he lived ſo ſtrictly at that florid Age, and in thoſe wicked times, that no act of Luſt, or inordinate pleaſure could be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; for he ſeemed to have changed his Youth into Age. And then he was a Perſon of ſuch courage and conduct, that he was the firſt who inveſted all the Power of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Pope alone, ſo that he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Magiſtrates, as he pleaſed, and fortified the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> which is ſituate near the <hi>Tiber</hi> as you go to the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and ſet guards upon all the Bridges croſs the <hi>Tiber.</hi> Whilſt this <hi>Boniface</hi> IX. was in the Chair, <hi>Galeatius</hi> made War upon the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Bolognians,</hi> by his Generals, <hi>John <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldin</hi> and <hi>Lantedeſcus Petramala,</hi> who in the Valley of <hi>Arno</hi> plunder'd and ſpoil'd all far and near. <hi>James Vermes</hi>

likewiſe enter'd the Territories of <hi>Bolognia</hi> upon his own account, and did the City great damage. The <hi>Florentines</hi> in the mean time, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent with their utmoſt, theſe evils, ſent <hi>Jown Hawkwood, Charles,</hi> Son to <hi>Bernabos,</hi> and <hi>Antony Scala</hi> with four thouſand Horſe, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, to aid the <hi>Bolognian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> their friends and Allies: And ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Stephen</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> (to whom <hi>Francis</hi> the younger was fled fot refuge) both by Letters and Meſſengers to come and aſſiſt 'em. Beſide they hired <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Armeniac</hi> for a great deal of Money, to come down into <hi>Italy</hi> againſt <hi>Viconti,</hi> and divert him from their borders, to defend his own. <hi>Francis</hi> the younger alſo, at their Intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, diſguiſing himſelf, and favoured by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> got into <hi>Padua,</hi> and took the City before any body was aware. The Duke of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> follow'd him at the heels, and entering the Town, ſtorm'd the Caſtle without any intermiſſion. And the <hi>Veroneſes,</hi> ſtartled at this turn of Affairs, beat out the Guards of the <hi>Viconti,</hi> and invited <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony Scala</hi> to their ſide, who juſt about that time died in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one onely Child, a little Boy. Which when they heard, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of what they had done, and immediately ſent for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>gulot Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardus,</hi> who was with <hi>Galeatius</hi>'s Army in <hi>Cremona,</hi> having begg'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for their Crime, and paid ſome thouſands of pounds to atone for their Error. <hi>Blaneard</hi> being let in, could not keep the Soldiers from ſacking the wealthy City, but the Wife of <hi>Galeatius</hi> out of pity for the Noble Town after three days ſtay'd any further plundering. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> now complaining that the Subſidies promiſed him by the <hi>Florentines</hi> were not fairly paid him, raiſed the Siege of the Caſtle at <hi>Padua</hi> and went into <hi>Germany.</hi> Thereupon the <hi>Florentines,</hi> having procured paſſage for their Troops of <hi>Albert d' Eſte,</hi> who was fallen out with <hi>Galeatius</hi> a good while before, ſent <hi>John Hawkwood</hi> to aſſiſt young <hi>Carrara</hi>; by whoſe Valour and skill the Caſtle of <hi>Padua</hi> was quickly brought to ſurrender. So that the Forces of <hi>Galeatius</hi> who were ſent for their relief retired into the Country of <hi>Vicenza.</hi> By this time the Earl of <hi>Armagnac,</hi> a Penſioner of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> was arriv'd in <hi>Italy</hi> by the way of <hi>Turin,</hi> with twenty thouſand Horſe, and having taken <hi>Caſtellaccio</hi> by ſtorm, he gave the plunder to his Soldiers. To oppoſe this Enemy <hi>Galeatius</hi> was neceſſitated to recall his men out of the Country of <hi>Vicenza:</hi> while the <hi>Milaneſes</hi> who were poſted in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs, of <hi>Alexandria</hi> were furiouſly ſet upon by thoſe of <hi>Armagnac</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any order; but the <hi>Italians</hi> drew out the Battel ſo long, fighting for ſome time before the Gates, till their men (whom they had ſent about, to fall upon their Enemy in the Reer) could have time to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe 'em. While the fight continued, they came about. So that the Enemy was attaqu'd in the Reer, Front and Flank, in ſuch a dreadful manner (for the Towns-People alſo aided them) that they were almoſt all of 'em kill'd, before they were ſenſible what danger they were in. The Earl of <hi>Armagnac</hi> himſelf, General of this great Army, was taken, but died immediately of a wound that he receiv'd. Beſides him there were taken <hi>Rainardus Lanfigliatius,</hi> and <hi>John Riccio,</hi> two <hi>Florentine</hi> Knights, who had guided the Earl into <hi>Italy. Galeatius</hi> grown confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by this Victory, ſent part of his Foces againſt <hi>Hawkwood,</hi> who had paſs'd the Rivers <hi>Adige,</hi> and <hi>Mencio,</hi> to join <hi>Armagnac</hi>; upon notice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Hawkwood</hi> haſted toward <hi>Padua</hi>; but loſt a great many men by the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:50681:185"/>
way, who were drown'd in the <hi>Seluces</hi> that the Country people had made to hinder their retreat. But the <hi>Florentines</hi> being hard put to it by <hi>James Vermes,</hi> who was ſent thither by <hi>Galeatius</hi> with twelve thouſand Horſe and four thouſand Foot, called back <hi>Hawkwood,</hi> who overcame their Enemies by ſtratagem, whom he was not able to conquer in the open field. In the mean time a Peace was made at <hi>Genoa</hi> upon good conditions, between <hi>Galeatius</hi> and the <hi>Florentines</hi> by the mediation of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> and <hi>Antony Adurno</hi> General of the <hi>Genoeſes.</hi> But one flame was no ſooner quench'd, but another broke out. For <hi>Francis di Vico</hi> Prefect of the City got <hi>Viterbo</hi> out of the Popes hands by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery; And <hi>Peter Gambacurta,</hi> Lord of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and his Sons, was kill'd by <hi>James</hi> his Secretary, and Counſellor, who ſtrait uſurp'd his Seigniory. At this time alſo upon the death of <hi>Albert d' Eſte,</hi> one <hi>Azzo</hi> of the ſame Family, who had been baniſh'd a long time, attempted to be reſtor'd to his Country by the Power of the Counts of <hi>Cunie.</hi> But the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of young <hi>Nicolas,</hi> Son of <hi>Albert,</hi> took up Arms, and driving <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> from <hi>Ferrara,</hi> promiſed the Towns of <hi>Lugo</hi> and <hi>Monſelice</hi> to <hi>John Cunio,</hi> if he would kill <hi>Azzo.</hi> But he ſhewed 'em a trick for it, and only kill'd a man very like him; upon which the Towns being ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to him, he produced the real <hi>Azzo. Alberic</hi> his Progenitor would never have done ſuch an Act; to whom the <hi>Italians</hi> owe more than to all the Generals of his Age. For he firſt taught the <hi>Italians</hi> the Art of War (when they had been long unaccuſtomed to Arms) how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves from domeſtick as well as forein Enemies. For before his time, if the <hi>Italians</hi> had any War either among themſelves or againſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> they were forced to deſire the aid of forein Soldiers. But he raiſed ſuch a mighty Army in a ſhort ſpace under the Banner of St. <hi>George,</hi> that he drave the <hi>Britains</hi> (who had ruined our Country, and the Caſtles belonging to the Church) together with the <hi>Germans, Engliſh</hi> and all other Invaders, out of <hi>Italy.</hi> From him aroſe the <hi>Brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſchi</hi> and <hi>Sforceſchi,</hi> by whom <hi>Italy</hi> gain'd ſo much Glory, that other Nations either were content to be quiet for fear, or if they attempted to invade us, 'twas at the coſt of their lives. In the mean time <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> VII. the Anti-Pope died, and in his place the Cardinals, who join'd in the preſent Schiſm, put up <hi>Peter Luna,</hi> then called <hi>Benedict</hi> XIII. at <hi>Avignion.</hi> At that time alſo <hi>Winceſlaus,</hi> Son to <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, ſucceeded him; from whom <hi>John Galeatius Viconti</hi> received the Title of Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> by his Embaſſador <hi>Peter Philargi</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> who afterward got the Papacy, and was called <hi>Alexander</hi> the Fifth. But <hi>Galeatius</hi> when <hi>John Hawkwood</hi> was dead and buried at <hi>Florence,</hi> (whom the <hi>Florentines</hi> made uſe of as their chief Commander in their Wars) He reſov'd to ſend <hi>Albrick</hi> with an Army into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> to keep the <hi>Florentines</hi> in awe, who then made War upon <hi>Appiax</hi> Lord of <hi>Piſa.</hi> There were in that Army <hi>Paul <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin, Ceculino, Brolia, Brandelino, Paul Sabello, Luke Canali,</hi> great Captains; who going with joint-forces and Counſels to beſiege <hi>Florence,</hi> pitched their Camp near the <hi>Carthuſian</hi> Monaſtery; from whence they continually infeſted the City of <hi>Florence</hi> and all the Country about it, with frequent inrodes, and filled all places with ſlaughter, rapine, and fire, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1397. At which time <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> went to <hi>Perugia,</hi> to procure a reconciliation between the Nobility and Commonalty, there. But the Commonalty, even in the Popes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:50681:185"/>
took up Arms againſt their Promiſe, and kill'd eighty of the Nobles, and then made <hi>Biordo,</hi> and <hi>Nichilotto,</hi> who were admitted into the City as heads of their Faction, chief Lords of all. The Pope was angry at that, and went to <hi>Aſſiſi,</hi> from whence he ſent Agents to <hi>Galeatius,</hi> to deſire him, that he ceaſe to attempt <hi>Mantua,</hi> which he then beſieged by Land and Water, having ſent for <hi>Albrick Barbianus</hi> into that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to aſſiſt in the War. But the <hi>Florentines</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> being bound as Allies to aid <hi>Mantua,</hi> they ſent a good Army under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Charles Malateſta,</hi> (Couſin to the Duke of <hi>Mantuan</hi>) who defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Galeatius</hi>'s forces at <hi>Governo.</hi> At that time the <hi>Florentines</hi> had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to fall upon the <hi>Piſans,</hi> but the Earls of <hi>Puppio</hi> and <hi>Balono,</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bertine</hi> Rebels, who threaten'd deſtruction to the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> if they ſtirred a foot againſt the <hi>Piſans,</hi> diverted them from it. But not long after <hi>James Appian</hi> died, and his Son <hi>Gerard</hi> ſucceeded him, who when he could not keep <hi>Piſa</hi> in ſubjection, by reaſon of the Tumults which the <hi>Florentines</hi> raiſed in it, he ſold the City to <hi>Galeatius Viconti,</hi> in the year 1399. keeping onely one Town for him and his, called <hi>Piumbino.</hi> At <hi>Perugia Biordus,</hi> being ſlain by the contrivance of <hi>Lantedeſcus,</hi> the <hi>Perugians</hi> endeavour'd to aſſert their Liberty: And when <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>golin Trinci</hi> of <hi>Fuligno,</hi> the Popes Vicar there, endeavour'd in his name to bring <hi>Perugia</hi> into the Churches Patrimony, the Citizens were angry, and ſurrender'd themſelves to <hi>Galeatius</hi>; who two months after got poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion alſo of <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Lucca</hi> by a wile. Hence was the fear of the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſo encreaſed, that they gave out, that they and their Liberty were all loſt, unleſs <hi>Galeatius</hi> were taken off. The Year of Jubilee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, the Pope was moved by Embaſſadors from <hi>Rome</hi> to leave <hi>Aſſiſi</hi> and reſide with them; which though he was very willing to do, yet he concealed his deſire, and told 'em, he would not; becauſe, he ſaid, they denied to have Senators choſen out of forein Nobility according to the Cuſtom and Orders of former Popes; and becauſe they had choſen Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervators of the Chamber on their own head: Men not fit for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, who gave too much Licence to the <hi>Bandereſii.</hi> Then the <hi>Romans,</hi> to gratifie the Pope, remov'd the <hi>Bandereſii,</hi> and admitted of <hi>Malateſta</hi> Son to <hi>Pandulphus,</hi> of <hi>Peſaro,</hi> a learned Man, as Senator, in the Popes Name, and furniſh'd <hi>Boniface</hi> with Money to go to <hi>Rome.</hi> When he was come into the City, he fortified S. <hi>Angelo</hi> (as I told you) with Walls and Turrets, and made himſelf by degrees Maſter of the whole place. After that, in the year 1400. the Jubilee was kept, and a great multitude of People ſtock'd to <hi>Rome</hi> for Devotion, and then the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> being willing to be rid of <hi>Galeatius,</hi> invited <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> (whom the Electors of the Empire having depoſed <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi> of <hi>Bohemia</hi> for his ſloth, had choſen Emperor) to come into <hi>Italy</hi> upon condition, that he ſhould not have the promiſed reward, till he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd as far as the Dutchy of <hi>Millain.</hi> But when he was come to <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcia,</hi> near the <hi>Lago di Grada,</hi> and had receiv'd part of the Money, he engaged with <hi>Galeatius,</hi> and loſing the day, fled to <hi>Trent.</hi> The <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> promiſed him great things to keep him from going back into <hi>Germany,</hi> but all would not do. At that time <hi>Boniface,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of fear of the Power of the <hi>Viconti,</hi> or out of covetouſneſs to enlarge the Churches Patrimony, was the firſt that impoſed <hi>Annates,</hi> or yearly payments upon Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, upon this condition,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:50681:186"/>
that whoever got a Benefice, ſhould pay half an years Revenue into the Apoſtolical Treaſury. Yet there are thoſe who attribute this Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>John</hi> XXII. Now all Countreys admitted of this uſage, except the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who granted it onely in caſe of Biſhopricks, but not in other Benefices. Being thus ſtrengthened with Money, and chooſing Magiſtrates as he pleaſed, both in the City and all over the Church Dominions, the Pope reſtored <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> a Youth, Son to <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> into his Fathers Kingdom, which was uſurp'd by ſuch as ſided at that time with <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Anjou.</hi> And to do it the more eaſily and honourably he aboliſh'd that deprivation of <hi>Charles,</hi> which <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> had promulged at <hi>Nocera,</hi> and ſent Cardinal <hi>Florentino</hi> to <hi>Cajeta</hi> (which was the onely place, that had continu'd Loyal) to crown the Youth there where he had been ſo loyally preſerv'd. <hi>Galeatius</hi> thus rid of the Emperor, ſent his Army under the command of <hi>Albrick</hi> againſt <hi>John Bentivoglio,</hi> who had turn'd out the Gariſon, and made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Bologna.</hi> At this time <hi>Francis Gonzaga</hi> fought in <hi>Galeatius</hi>'s Army (for they two were friends again) as alſo <hi>Pandulphus Malateſta, Charle</hi>'s Brother, and <hi>Ottobon Roſſi</hi> of <hi>Parma.</hi> The names of theſe Men terrified the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſo, that they ſent <hi>Bernardo</hi> their General to aſſiſt the <hi>Bolognians</hi> their Allies; which ſo encourag'd the <hi>Bolognians,</hi> that they engaged the Enemy before their Walls; but had the worſt, and loſt all their Horſe, as alſo <hi>Bernardo,</hi> who was kill'd in the fight. <hi>James Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> was taken, but preſerv'd at the requeſt of <hi>Francis Gonzaga. Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivoglio</hi> fled with a ſmall number into the City; which whilſt he ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended, he fell into an Ambuſcade where he was kill'd, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my not being able to take him alive; ſo that now <hi>Galeatius</hi> eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſter of <hi>Bologna,</hi> and ſtruck great terrour into the <hi>Florentines,</hi> threatning ſuddenly to turn all the force of his Arms upon them: But not long after he died at <hi>Marignan</hi> of a Fever, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1402. whoſe death, long wiſh'd for by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> freed them from many fears, and was preſignified by a Comet which appear'd ſome time before. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this many Uſurpers aroſe, either thoſe who were chief in their Cities or who had command among the Soldiery, by corrupting the Gariſons, ſeiz'd their ſeveral Towns; there being now no one Man of Authority and Power to correct their ambitions and exceſſes, infinite miſchiefs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. That fatal Sedition too of the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibellins</hi> was renew'd, which ran through <hi>Italy</hi> two hundred years and above, and raiſed ſuch civil Wars among the ſeveral Cities, that they fought till they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſtroy'd each other. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>golinus Cavalcabos,</hi> having vanquiſh'd the <hi>Gibellins,</hi> was Lord of <hi>Cremona:</hi> whilſt <hi>Otho</hi> the third got <hi>Parma,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the <hi>Roſſi.</hi> The <hi>Soardi</hi> ſeiz'd <hi>Bergamo,</hi> the <hi>Ruſconii</hi> took <hi>Como,</hi> the <hi>Vignati</hi> poſſeſs'd themſelves of <hi>Lodi,</hi> and <hi>Fazino Cane</hi> an excellent General made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Vercelli, Aleſſandria,</hi> and many other Towns thereabout. I omit others, who having been expell'd by <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leatius,</hi> then were in ſome hopes of recovering their uſurped Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: eſpecially <hi>William Scala,</hi> and <hi>Charles Viconti,</hi> Son to <hi>Bernabos,</hi> who ſollicited all the Princes and People to revolt. Upon this account <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras Ordelaphus</hi> was baniſh'd his Country and got poſſeſſion of <hi>Forli</hi>; and <hi>Albrick</hi> Earl of <hi>Cuni,</hi> would have reduced <hi>Faenza,</hi> then brought to extremity, if he had not been ſent for in haſte by <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> by the Popes advice, and made Great Conſtable of <hi>Naples.</hi> The Pope had ſent his
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:50681:186"/>
Brother alſo thither with a competenr Army, to aſſiſt the King; but he being expelled by the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> moved toward <hi>Perugia,</hi> and ſoon made that City ſubject to the Pope. <hi>Balteſar Caſſa</hi> alſo a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> compell'd the <hi>Bolognians</hi> to return to the Church-party, after he had beſieged them for ſome time; in which expedition <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius Montonius</hi> led the Church-forces, as being a Perſon well skill'd in Military Affairs, and left for that reaſon in <hi>Romagna</hi> by <hi>Albrick.</hi> For he had fought under him from his youth, and been a Commander, as had <hi>Sfortia,</hi> who was born in <hi>Cotignola</hi> a Town of <hi>Romagna.</hi> By whoſe valour and proweſs the Militia of <hi>Italy</hi> ſo improved, that whoever wanted a Commander, would make uſe of one of them. Hence thoſe Military Factions ſo increaſed that all the troubles of <hi>Italy</hi> for ſixty years might be imputed to one of them. For he, that was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by the <hi>Brachians,</hi> immediately hired the <hi>Sfortians</hi> to revenge his quarrel. But <hi>Albrick</hi> (from whom as from the <hi>Trojan Horſe</hi> ſo many Generals did come) made <hi>Naples</hi> yield to <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> after a long Siege. At which Victory all the Princes of the Kingdom and all the Cities ſurrender'd themſelves to the King. But <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> over deſirous of enlarging his Kingly power, before he had laid a good foundation in <hi>Naples,</hi> was ſent for into <hi>Hungary,</hi> to accept of that Kingdom by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary right; and in order thereunto ſent over his Forces. But whilſt he was beſieging <hi>Zara,</hi> his Friends ſent him word, that the <hi>Neapolitans</hi> were like to revolt; wherefore having taken <hi>Zara,</hi> and ſold it to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he return'd to <hi>Naples</hi>; and calling back <hi>Albrick</hi> out of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magna,</hi> he depoſed all the Nobles, and baniſh'd thoſe that refuſed to obey him. But he was very ſevere upon the Family of <hi>Sanſeverino,</hi> and put the chiefeſt of them to death. <hi>Boniface</hi> being troubled at ſuch a tedious confuſion of Affairs, at length died of a Pleuriſie, in the fourteenth year and the ninth month of his Pontificate, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1404. He was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at S. <hi>Peters</hi> in a Marble Tomb, of Moſaic work, ſtill to be ſeen with his Coat of Arms: which ſhews alſo that he built much in S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> the Capitol, and the <hi>Vatican.</hi> Nor had any thing been wanting to the glory of this Pope, if he had not been too partial to his Relations: Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony being often committed, by reaſon that his Brethren and Friends, who came to <hi>Rome</hi> in great multitudes to get Money, ask'd for every thing that fell in his gift, without any reaſon. As for Indulgencies, and thoſe plenary too, they were ſold about at ſuch a rate, that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Keys and the Popes Bulls was brought into contempt. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface</hi> indeed endeavour'd to amend theſe things, but was forced by the importunity of his Friends to let it alone. And for this reaſon I think it would go better with the Church of God, if Popes would not mind their kindred, or at leaſt not too much, but conſult the good and honour of the Papacy rather than promote the intereſt of fleſh and blood. Eſpecially at that time, when <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> who conquer'd the Turks, and led their Emperor in Chains along with him, was dead, and had left all the <hi>Armenians, Perſians, Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Governors: ſo that the Chriſtians might eaſily have recover'd <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and the Holy Sepulchre. But his care was plac'd nearer home, for he perſecuted the <hi>Albi,</hi> [<hi>Bianchi</hi> or Whites] that would have introduced a new ſort of Superſtition under his Pontificate, of whom I heard my Father (who ſaw the Man) ſay, that there was a
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:50681:187"/>
certain Prieſt who came down from the <hi>Alps</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> the year afore the Jubilee, with a great many after him: and being clothed in white Cloth, pretended ſo much modeſty, that every body look'd upon him as a Saint. So that this Fellow coming into <hi>Italy</hi> drew a great number of Men and Women over to his Opinion in a ſhort time. And theſe People at Night, lay, Men or Women, Peſants or Citizens, Servants or Freemen, promiſcuouſly together cover'd with their white Robes, like ſo many Sheep. They feaſted in the publick Streets, and ſtrove who ſhould bring the beſt proviſions. The Prieſt himſelf carried a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix, which, he ſaid wept for the ſins of Mankind; and as often as it did ſo, the people ſet up a clamour and begg'd pardon of God. They ſang the Lauds, or Praiſes of the Bleſſed Virgin, going along and ſtanding ſtill, in Hymns made for that purpoſe. But as he came from <hi>Piedmont</hi> and that way, into <hi>Romagna, Tuſcany,</hi> and <hi>Millain,</hi> the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his ſanctity was advanced, whereby he brought over not only the rude and unlearn'd Commonalty, but even great Men and Biſhops of ſeveral Cities. At <hi>Viterbo,</hi> being tired with travelling, he tarried with the multitude, and from thence, ſaid, he would come to <hi>Rome,</hi> to viſit the holy Places, and Bodies of the Saints. But <hi>Boniface</hi> fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to be a Cheat, and thinking, as he ſaid, that the ſuperſtitious Knave had a mind to get the Popedom by the aſſiſtance of that Gang about him, he ſent Soldiers to meet him, and bring him to <hi>Rome.</hi> Which done, ſome write, that his knavery was detected by Fortune, and that he was deſervedly burnt alive; but others ſay the Man was guiltleſs, and that it was onely a trick of the Pope to raiſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of him, whereas he put him to death out of envy.

                  </hi> for there was a mortal hatred between the <hi>Padu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Vincenza.</hi> So then, the <hi>Venetians</hi> admoniſh'd <hi>Francis Carrara,</hi> that he ſhould not meddle with thoſe of <hi>Vincenza</hi> who were their Tributaries: and that he would raiſe the Siege from <hi>Cologna,</hi> which they accounted within their Dominions; if not, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> would revenge their quarrels. <hi>Francis</hi> reply'd, that he admired at the impudence of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who though they have no right or claim to any thing upon the Continent, yet would preſcribe Laws to them who had juſt Titles. He therefore bad 'em go and confine themſelves within their Bays, and Fens, and let them alone to govern the ſeveral Cities, who had derived a right to it from their Forefathers.

ſurrender of the Soldiers within, who were ready to ſtarve. But <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> being taken and ſent to <hi>Venice</hi> was put to death along with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this was the end of him, who indulged his own luſt of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo much, that he contemn'd Peace, and would get all things by force of Arms. But this was not the end of our misfortunes. For, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the neglect of Popes (who uſed to procure Peace either by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdictions, Menaces, or force) or rather by means of the Schiſm (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the Church of God did at that time labour) it was come to that paſs, that every baſe Uſurper, after the death of <hi>John Galeatius,</hi> would venture upon any miſchievous Deſign. And though <hi>Innocent,</hi> whilſt he was Cardinal, uſed to blame the negligence and timorouſneſs of former Popes, ſaying, their ſloth was the cauſe, that the Schiſm, which was the bane of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and of all Chriſtendom, was not rooted out. Yet when himſelf had gotten the Popedom, he follow'd <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbans</hi> and <hi>Bonifaces</hi> ſteps in ſeveral things, which he had carp'd at in them when he was a private perſon: and not onely did not what he had before commended, but took it very ill if any one mention'd it to him. Beſide he was ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Adminiſtration of the Government, that once, when the <hi>Romans</hi> deſired to have their Liberty reſtored, and that the Capitol, <hi>Ponte Molle,</hi> and S. <hi>Angelo</hi> might be put into their hands, and alſo were urgent with him to extirpate the Schiſms (which had been ſo deſtructive, and of ſuch ill example) out of the Church, and that he would ſeek the Peace of Chriſtendom (ſince the King of <hi>France</hi> promiſed to aſſiſt him in it, and <hi>Peter Luna</hi> the Anti-Pope was not againſt ſo good a work) the Pope e'en ſent the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves to <hi>Lewis,</hi> his Nephew, who lay at the Hoſpital of the Holy Ghoſt in the Stone-Way, as to an Executioner. For eleven of theſe publick-ſpirited Citizens were preſently put to death, and thrown out at the Windows; for that he ſaid, was the onely way to remove Schiſm and Sedition. The People of <hi>Rome</hi> were ſo incens'd at this cruel uſage, that they ſent for <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and took up Arms to revenge themſelves of <hi>Lewis.</hi> But the Pope, to avoid the fury of the People took <hi>Lewis</hi> along with him and ran away to <hi>Viterbo.</hi> Whereupon the People, ſeeing they could not ſatisfie their wrath upon the Author of the Villany, they turn'd their indignation upon the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and plunder'd them of all they had. Yet ſome, they ſay, were preſerv'd in the Houſes of ſeveral <hi>Roman</hi> Cardinals, who with much ado, did make a ſhift to protect thoſe that fled to 'em, by the aſſiſtance of their Clients. Then the <hi>Romans</hi> having taken the Capitol, and <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Molle,</hi> they attempted S. <hi>Angelo</hi>; but in vain, though they were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by <hi>John Columna</hi> Earl of <hi>Troja, Gentilis Monteranus,</hi> Earl of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> great Commanders under King <hi>Ladiſlaus.</hi> But when <hi>Paul <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> came upon them by order of the Pope, with <hi>Moſtarda</hi> and <hi>Cecchalino,</hi> they routed <hi>John Columna</hi> and <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi>'s Men that were left, in a place called <hi>Neros Meads.</hi> This was a great damage to the <hi>Romans</hi>; for their Men and Cattel were driven away; and therefore when their anger was over, they became friends with the Pope, and deſired him to return home to the City. For he was naturally courteous, and affable, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the civil and Canon Law, and well skill'd in the Art of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. When therefore things were thus compoſed, he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made more Cardinals, among which were <hi>Angelus Carrara,</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> after called <hi>Gregory</hi> XII. <hi>Peter Philar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:50681:188"/>
a <hi>Candiot,</hi> Cardinal of the Twelve Apoſtles, afterward <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Otho Columna,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>George,</hi> after called <hi>Martin</hi> V. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſetled the Popedom he created <hi>Lewis,</hi> his Nephew Marquis of <hi>Marca d' Ancona</hi> and Prince of <hi>Fermo:</hi> but he himſelf died a little after at <hi>Rome</hi> in the ſecond year of his Pontificate; and was buried in S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in a Chappel that was formerly dedicated to the Popes (which <hi>Nicolas</hi> V. afterward repair'd) and his Tomb bears this Inſcription; <hi>Innocentio</hi> VII. <hi>Pontifici Maximo cum neglecti ejus Sepulchri memoria interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſet,</hi> Nicolas V. <hi>Pontifex Maximus reſtitui curavit.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Italians</hi> wanted a true Pope and a good Emperor, and therefore every one did what they pleaſed. For <hi>Cabrinus Fundulus,</hi> of whom <hi>Charles Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>valcabos</hi> made great uſe both in War and Peace, being puffed up with hopes of being ſole Governour (becauſe all Magiſtrates and Lieutenants of Caſtles obey'd him as much as <hi>Charles</hi>) he murther'd <hi>Charles,</hi> with his Brethren and Kindred at <hi>Machaſturma,</hi> ten miles from <hi>Cremona</hi> as he was coming back from <hi>Lodi.</hi> From thence he fled with a few Men to <hi>Cremona,</hi> before the thing was known in the City; and having gotten poſſeſſion of the Fort and all the Gates, he went into the Market all in Arms, and whomſoever he ſaw that was likely to withſtand his Deſigns, he baniſh'd or put to Death. But to make himſelf abſolute he omitted no kind of cruelty. Nor could the great Men of <hi>Milan</hi> hinder this, being themſelves embroil'd by the different Deſigns of <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cegaldo</hi> Governour of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who attempted to bring <hi>Milan</hi> to ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the <hi>French</hi> King, and of <hi>Facino Cane</hi> an excellent Commander, who ſtrove to conſerve it in the hands of the Heir <hi>John Maria Viſconte.</hi> Now alſo <hi>Otho</hi> III.

and deſired him to commiſerate the Church now falling to ruin, though it were to relinquiſh the Pontificate: he having promiſed ſo to do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath in the Conclave, when he was made Pope. And they engaged the other Pope, that was then made at <hi>Rome</hi> after <hi>Innocents</hi> death, ſhould do the ſame. For theſe Princes and thoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> who both were hearty Lovers of Chriſtianity, had agreed, that thoſe two which ſtrove for the Pontificate, of whom one was of the <hi>French</hi> and the other of the <hi>Italian</hi> faction, ſhould be put by, and ſome one afterward elected, that might be the common Father and Pope of all Nations. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> reply'd, That he ſhould grievouſly offend God, if he forſook the Church of God, whoſe Patron and publick Father he was made by univerſal conſent of all good Men, and that he would not hold that Seat precariouſly to which he had been ſo fairly choſen. As to what they ſaid concerning extirpating the Schiſm and treating of Unity, he profeſs'd, it pleaſed him very much, ſo it were debated in a free place, and that no man might lie under any force from either Party. Yet one thing he promiſed 'em, and confirmed it with an Oath, that if the Schiſm could not be compoſed by any other means, that then he would wholly lay down the Pontifical Dignity, if the other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Pope would do ſo at the ſame time. Thereupon the Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſult among themſelves, how they ſhould bring over <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi> to their Opinion. But he fearing their Conſults and conferences, furniſh'd the Papal <hi>Palais</hi> with Arms and all neceſſary proviſions; and there he ſtay'd and was beſieged for ſome months, till at laſt he got Galleys ready for his eſcape, and ſailed down the <hi>Roſne</hi> into <hi>Catalonia,</hi> where he was born. There are indeed, who write that the Princes of <hi>France</hi> did make that attempt upon <hi>Benedict</hi> by the perſwaſion of <hi>French</hi> Cardinals, who hated him, becauſe he was not of their Nation. For when they could not agree concerning the choice of a <hi>French</hi> Pope after <hi>Clement</hi>'s death, they elected him (after a long Debate) as a Perſon of great Virtue and Devotion; but he often admoniſhing them to live ſoberly and holily, and forbidding Simony upon ſevere penalties, they grew weary of his ſtrictneſs, and notwithſtanding his love to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, inſtigated the <hi>French</hi> Princes againſt him. Chriſtianity was in all Countreys, but moſt of all in <hi>France,</hi> they met at S. <hi>Peters</hi> in the <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tican,</hi> where each of 'em took an Oath, and bound it with the greateſt imprecations, that they would relinquiſh the Pontificate, whoſoever of 'em happen'd to be elected to that great Dignity, upon condition that the Anti-Pope would do the ſame. They came to this reſolution, to ſatisfie the <hi>French</hi> Nation, who having been ſo fooliſh to make an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti-Pope, had brought in a cuſtom, from which they could not recede without diſhonour, unleſs the <hi>Italians</hi> did ſo too: and not onely ſo, but to comply with <hi>Benedict</hi>'s judgment, who ſaid the Church could never be healed but by that means onely: But if both were depoſed, one true Pope might be elected by conſent of all the Cardinals there, to whom all Kings and Princes ſhould pay obedience. Upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>Angelus Corarius</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Marks</hi> (who, as I told you, was called <hi>Gregory</hi> XII.) was choſen at <hi>Rome Novem.</hi> 2. 1406. and immediately in writing, by the hands of Notaries and before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs confirm'd what he had promiſed before his Pontificate, and ſet his hand to it. But when they came to diſcourſe about a place, where
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:50681:189"/>
they might both meet without danger, and could not agree, they were eſteemed by both Aſſemblies of Cardinals no better than Shufflers, and Promiſe-breakers. Nevertheleſs the Cardinals, ſome from <hi>Rome</hi> and ſome from <hi>Avignion,</hi> met at <hi>Piſa,</hi> and there with one accord they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived <hi>Benedict</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> of their Pontifical Honour, and that by the conſent of all Nations, except the hither part of <hi>Spain,</hi> the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Armagnac</hi> who favour'd <hi>Benedict.</hi> Then they proceeded to elect a new Pope, who might govern the Church of God without Sedition, and the reſult was, the creating of <hi>Gregory</hi> being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and this Election depending, <hi>Rome</hi> was all up in Arms. For <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus</hi> the King had taken <hi>Oſtia,</hi> and put his Land and Sea-forces into it, and thereby ſo haraſs'd the <hi>Romans</hi> with inroads, that he forc'd them to ſue for Peace, and to receive him honourably into the City as their Governour, where he changed their civil Officers, fortified according to his own mind their Gates and Walls. But <hi>Paul <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin,</hi> General of the Church-forces came upon him, they fought ſtoutly in the <hi>Septimiano</hi> near S. <hi>James</hi>'s, and loſt a great many Men on each ſide.

Nay <hi>Alexander</hi> was a Perſon of that Courage as to depoſe that powerful King <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> (who in the abſence of ſeveral Popes had for a long time much ſpoil'd and haraſs'd the Church Dominions and taken ſome Towns by force) at <hi>Piſa</hi> in the Council there, by approbation of all that were preſent; and declared his Kingdom to belong to <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou.</hi> But when the Council of <hi>Piſa</hi> brake up, the Pope went to <hi>Bologna,</hi> of which <hi>Baldeſar Coſſa,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> was Governour. Him <hi>Alexander</hi> confirm'd in his Office, becauſe by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and conduct the Council was held at <hi>Piſa</hi>; and becauſe he was a Man fit to oppoſe Uſurpers or ſuch as encroached upon the Church Revenues. Yet there was more of ruſticity, boldneſs, and worldlineſs in him, than his profeſſion required. He led a military Life, and his manners were Soldier-like, and he took the liberty of doing many things not fit to be named. But when <hi>Alexander</hi> was very ſick and knew his death was very near, he exhorted the Cardinals that viſited him to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Peace, and to defend the Honour of the Church: And ſwore by that Death, he was juſt now about to undergo, and by the Conſcience of his well-acted Life, that he did not think or believe that any thing was Decreed in the <hi>Piſan</hi> Council but with all juſtice and integrity, without any deceit, or fraud. This ſaid, and the People weeping that ſtood by, he repeated that ſaying of our Saviour with much ado, <hi>My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave with you</hi>; and immediately dy'd, in the eighth month of his Pontificate; and was buried at <hi>Bologna</hi> in the Church of the Friers <hi>Minors:</hi> in which year there was a Famine and a Plague.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">J</seg>OHN</hi> the Twenty Fourth, a Noble <hi>Neapolitan,</hi> formerly called <hi>Coſſa Baldeſar,</hi> was choſen Pope at <hi>Bologna</hi> by general conſent, though ſome ſay the Election was carried by force; becauſe he was not only Legate of <hi>Bologna,</hi> but had Soldiers in the City and Country planted for the purpoſe, ſo that if he could not get it by fair means, he would by foul. However it was, it is moſt certain, that he was made Pope, and always aſpired to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. For when he was a Youth, and ſtudied Civil Law at <hi>Bologna</hi> for ſome years, he took his Degree there (according to Cuſtom) and then went to <hi>Rome.</hi> And being ask'd by ſome Friends whether he was going, he anſwer'd, To the Pontificate. When he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was entertain'd by <hi>Boniface</hi> IX. and made one of his Privy Chamber: Then he was made Cardinal of S. <hi>Euſtachius</hi>'s, and ſent as Legate <hi>à La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere</hi> to <hi>Bologna,</hi> which he in a ſhort ſpace ſubjected to the Church; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a great part of <hi>Romagna,</hi> beating aut ſome Uſurpers and putting others to death. But after nine years, when he had enlarged the City of <hi>Bologna</hi> in a wonderful manner by a long Peace, and got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a great deal of Money; <hi>Alexander</hi> died, and then he uſed Bribery, eſpecially to the Cardinals, that <hi>Gregory</hi> had made, (who were yet poor) and ſo was made Pope. Thereupon he ſent Agents to the Electors of the Empire, to deſire of 'em, that they would chooſe <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenburg,</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> Emperor; as being a perſon very ſtout, and fit, as he ſaid, for all brave Actions. For this was his way to get into <hi>Sigiſmunds</hi>'s favour. And that ſucceeding according to his mind, he told 'em before-hand, that, whereas it had been order'd in an Aſſembly at <hi>Piſa,</hi> that a Council ſhould be call'd at ſuch a certain time, he would hold it at <hi>Rome,</hi> and no where elſe. And that all might have the freer acceſs thither, he endeavour'd to ſettle <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially that part near the <hi>Alps,</hi> in which the War did daily encreaſe by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of <hi>Fazinus Canis,</hi> who could not keep his mercenary Soldiers under his Command without employment. For he uſed to maintain them by rapine and plunder. At that juncture it happen'd, that the <hi>Pavians,</hi> whom <hi>Philip</hi> could not contain in awe by reaſon of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, were grown factious, and took up Arms. Then the <hi>Gibellins,</hi> under the conduct of the <hi>Beccarian</hi> Family, brought <hi>Fazinus</hi> and his Army into the City, and were to have the <hi>Guelphs</hi> Eſtates for doing it. But <hi>Fazinus</hi> entering the Town with his Soldiers, ſpared neither one nor the other, but plunder'd both. And when the <hi>Gibellins</hi> complain'd, that their goods too were plunder'd againſt his Promiſe, he reply'd; The <hi>Gibellins,</hi> in their Perſons, ſhould be ſafe; but their Goods were <hi>Guelphs,</hi> which he would give as Spoil to the Soldiers, deriding the folly and covetouſneſs of both Factions. When he went from thence, he left a good Gariſon both at the Gates and in the Fort, pretending to be <hi>Philips</hi> Protector till he grew of Age; and ſo went againſt <hi>Pandulphus Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſta,</hi> where he teazed the <hi>Breſcians</hi> and the <hi>Bergameſes</hi> with frequent
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:50681:191"/>
inroads and ravagings; nor did he ſpare thoſe of <hi>Cremona,</hi> at that time govern'd by <hi>Cabrinus Fundulus.</hi> During theſe tranſactions the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> who was going (as he pretended) to <hi>Rome</hi> freely to receive the Imperial Crown, ſent twelve thouſand Horſe, and eight thouſand Foot againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and ſeizing <hi>Friuli,</hi> he ſet upon <hi>Treviſo.</hi> Againſt this great Army the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſent <hi>Charles Malateſta</hi> to keep them off, not ſo much by fighting as by protracting of the time. The <hi>Venetians</hi> had like alſo to have loſt <hi>Verona</hi> the ſame year by treachery of ſome of the Citizens, who had more mind to <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>try what they could get by violence, than to preſerve their Liberty. But thoſe that were guilty were puniſh'd. and there was an end of that. <hi>Fazinus Canis</hi> died the ſame year, after which ſeveral perſons conſpiring together kill'd <hi>John Maria</hi> Duke of <hi>Millain,</hi> and took <hi>Bernabos</hi>'s Son and Nephews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City. Then <hi>Philip,</hi> by the perſuaſions of his Friends, married <hi>Beatrice, Fazinus</hi>'s Widow, who was very Rich, and had Authority with the Soldiers that had fought under her Husband, <hi>Fazinus.</hi> By this means he had all the Cities, that paid homage to <hi>Fazinus,</hi> preſently ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd to him, and drew <hi>Carmignola,</hi> and <hi>Siccus Montagnanus</hi> (who had ſeditiouſly divided the Legion between them after <hi>Fazinus</hi>'s death) to come to fight under his Colours, by the perſwaſions of <hi>Beatrice.</hi> Which two Commanders <hi>Philip</hi> made uſe of afterward, and by their aſſiſtance drave <hi>Bernabos</hi>'s Son, <hi>Aſtorgius,</hi> out of <hi>Millain,</hi> but kill'd him at the taking of <hi>Monza.</hi> Things went thus in <hi>Millain</hi> and thereabouts, when <hi>John Francis Gonzaga,</hi> Son to <hi>Francis</hi> that was deceaſed, went with a competent Army of Horſe and Foot to guard <hi>Bologna,</hi> at the command of Pope <hi>John,</hi> under whoſe Banner he then fought. For <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateſta</hi> of <hi>Rimini,</hi> ſtipendiary to King <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> laid cloſe Siege to the City at that time. He therefore, by the aid of the <hi>Bolognians,</hi> fought ſeveral ſharp Battels with the Enemies; in which he had the better and defended the City moſt gloriouſly. The Winter following Pope <hi>John</hi> was invaded by <hi>Ladiſlaus,</hi> which made him remove from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> and thence to <hi>Bologna.</hi> Nor did he ſtay there long, but he went to <hi>Mantoua,</hi> where he was ſplendidly entertain'd by <hi>John Francis Gonzaga,</hi> whom he took along with him, at his departure thence, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with great part of his Forces to <hi>Lodi,</hi> whither he knew the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> would come. For he truſted much to that Prince, whoſe faithfulneſs and integrity he had ſuch experience of in the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lognian</hi> Wars, though he had been tempted by <hi>Malateſta</hi> with gifts and promiſes to revolt to the Kings party. But after when the Pope and the King did not think themſelves ſufficiently ſafe at <hi>Lauden,</hi> they ſent <hi>John Francis</hi> to <hi>Mantoua</hi> (whether they ſaid they'd go) with all ſpeed, to prepare for their coming and for the reception of ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. He went and quickly made all things ready, and then returned to <hi>Cremona,</hi> where he heard the Pope and the King by that time were arrived. After that he conducted them to <hi>Mantoua,</hi> where all the people came thronging out to meet them, and they were much more kindly receiv'd than was expected. Now in theſe ſeveral meetings at <hi>Lodi, Cremona,</hi> and <hi>Mantoua,</hi> it was conſider'd, how they ſhould remove <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus</hi> out of <hi>Campagna di Roma, Ombria,</hi> and <hi>Tuſcany</hi>; for he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Rome</hi> and many other Towns belonging to the Church. They ſaw that <hi>Italy</hi> could not be freed from the diſtractions of War by any other
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:50681:191"/>
means, and therefore they thought it convenient to adviſe concerning a ſupply to carry on the Affair not at <hi>Mantoua,</hi> but <hi>Bologna,</hi> when they were come thither. But they had greater concerns ſtill upon them. For <hi>John</hi> being urged to call a Council by conſent of all Nations, for the removal of the Schiſm, immediately ſent two Cardinals into <hi>Germany,</hi> to adviſe with the Princes of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> and chooſe a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place for a Council to be held at. Upon enquiry, <hi>Conſtance,</hi> a City within the Province of <hi>Mentze,</hi> ſeemed to be moſt commodious for the purpoſe. Thereupon they all went thither by a certain Day, according to Order; ſo likewiſe did Pope <hi>John</hi> himſelf, though ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to the contrary, becauſe they told him they fear'd, if he went thither as Pope, he would return thence as a private perſon: and ſo it fell out. For going thither with certain Men, that were excellent in all ſorts of Learning, he puzled the <hi>Germans</hi> ſo long with tedious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, that they could not tell what to Decree. But <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> came up, who gave every body leave to ſay what they pleaſed, and then great and grievous Crimes were laid to the Popes charge: upon which he went privately in diſguiſe from <hi>Conſtance</hi> to <hi>Scaphuſa,</hi> for fear ſome dangerous Plot might be contrived againſt him. <hi>Scaphuſa</hi> was a City belonging to the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whither ſeveral Cardinals alſo, that he had created, betook themſelves. But they being called again by Authority of the Council, <hi>John</hi> fled from <hi>Scaphuſa</hi> to <hi>Friburgh,</hi> deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go, if poſſibly he could with ſafety, to the Duke of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> But by the care of the Council, <hi>John</hi> was taken, and impriſon'd near <hi>Conſtance</hi> in the Iſle of S. <hi>Mark</hi> in the fourth year of his Pontificate, and the tenth month. Then the Council began to enquire the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his flight, and chooſe ſeveral perſons of great gravity and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Delegates, to examine and weigh the Objections made againſt <hi>John,</hi> and make an orderly report of it to the Council. There were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove forty Articles proved againſt him: of which ſome contain'd faults, which he was ſo habituated to, that he could not avoid them, and therefore they were judged contrary to the Faith; and ſome of them were likely to bring a ſcandal upon Chriſtianity in general, if they were not condemned in him. Wherefore ſince they all agreed in the ſame Opinion, <hi>John</hi> who was deſervedly and juſtly depoſed, approved of their Sentence though pronounced againſt him. And thereupon he was preſenty ſent to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> who was <hi>Gregory</hi> the 12th's Friend, to be kept in cuſtody, till further Order from the Council. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he was block'd up in the Caſtle of <hi>Haldeberg</hi> which was a very well fortified place, for three years, without any Chamberlain, or Servant to attend him, that was an <hi>Italian.</hi> All his keepers were <hi>Germans,</hi> with whom he was fain to talk by Nods and Signs, becauſe he neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Teutonick Language, nor they the <hi>Italian.</hi> They ſay <hi>John</hi> was depoſed by thoſe very Men, and them alone, that were formerly his Friends. For thoſe that were of <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Benedict</hi>'s Party were not yet come to the Council. Theſe Men therefore, that they might make their Deprivation of him juſt and perfect, with one accord pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd a Synodical Decree, wherein they affirm'd, that a general Council lawfully called was the Supream Authority next to Chriſt. (Grant but this fundamental Point and the Pope himſelf is inferiour to a Council.) Whereupon <hi>Gregory</hi> was forced, by the perſuaſions of the Emperor <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund,</hi>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:50681:192"/>
to ſend ſome Perſon to the Council (becauſe he would not go himſelf) to approve of their proceedings in his Name. So he ſent <hi>Charles Malateſta,</hi> an excellent Man, who ſeeing them all agree, to make <hi>Gregory</hi> alſo lay down all claim to the Papacy, he ſtood forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'em all, and ſitting down in a Chair that was made as ſtately as if <hi>Gregory</hi> himſelf had been there, he read the Inſtrument of Renunciation over and preſently depoſed <hi>Gregory:</hi> for which free act of his he was made Legate of <hi>Millain</hi> by all the Council. But this Perſon not long after dy'd at <hi>Recanati</hi> of grief (as ſome ſay) for his ſo ſudden Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation before the time appointed. For he was clearly for deferring the buſineſs as long as he could, as placing ſome hope in delay. But he died before <hi>Martin</hi> came to be Pope, and was buried in the Church of <hi>Recanati.</hi> Now though two Popes were removed, there remained a third who gave 'em more trouble than the other two, and that was <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Luna,</hi> called <hi>Benedict</hi> XIII. as I told you before. But to force him to reſign, <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> went perſonally with ſome Agents of the Council to the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and perſwaded them for the ſake of Chriſtianity ſo much endanger'd by the Schiſm, to aſſiſt him, now that the other two had laid down, in the removal of <hi>Benedict</hi>; who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering him to his mind, he went ſtraight to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> whoſe Subjects generally ſtood for <hi>Benedict,</hi> who agreed among other Articles, either to perſuade <hi>Benedict</hi> to reſign, or to cauſe his People to withdraw their ſubjection to him, (as <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had done in the Council) and to ſubmit to the Council; But <hi>Benedict</hi> kept in his ſtrong Caſtle, and would not comply, perſiſting that he was Chriſt's true Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car, and that the City of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> (where Pope <hi>John</hi> had been forc'd even by his own Friends to exauctorate himſelf) was not a place of Freedom requiſite for a General Council. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nobility ſeeing <hi>Benedicts</hi> obſtinacy, followed the Order of the Council, and came over to the reſt. Now things were carried in the Council by the Suffrages of five Nations, <hi>Italy, France, Germany, Spain</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was Decreed by their Votes, was confirm'd, and publiſh'd by a Beadle, publick Notary before the Court, as a general Act. By this Authority <hi>Benedict,</hi> when the matter had been bandied for ſome time, was deprived of the Popedom, the Nations that were of his ſide, being either abſent or rejected; eſpecially the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Armag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac.</hi> In the ſame Council the Hereſie of <hi>John Wickliffe</hi> was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and two of his followers, to wit, <hi>John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Jerome,</hi> his diſciple, as heads of the Hereſie, were burnt: becauſe they affirm'd, among other Errors, That Eccleſiaſtical Men ought to be poor, for that all People were offended at their great wealth and Luxury. Matters being thus compoſed, and mention made concerning Reforming the Church, and manners of the Clergy, they thought that could not be done whilſt the Sea was vacant. Then they Diſcours'd about electing a new Pope, that the Decrees of that Council might have the more Authority. And in order to it, they reſolv'd to chooſe ſix good Men out of every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who together with the Cardinals, ſhould go into the Conclave and chooſe a new Pope. <hi>Novemb.</hi> 8. 1417. they went into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave, and by conſent of 32 Cardinals, and all the ſeveral Nations (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expectation of all Men in the preſence of many of the Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks) <hi>Otho Columna,</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Cardinal Deacon of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:50681:192"/>
S. <hi>George</hi> was made Pope upon S. <hi>Martins</hi> day, <hi>Novem.</hi> 11. when the Sea had been without a true Pope for four years. And this was done ſo much to the ſatisfaction of all Men, that the joy was inexpreſſible. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was ſo mightily pleaſed at it, that he went into the Conclave and gave 'em thanks (without any reſpect to his own Dignity) for chooſing ſo good a Man, and one ſo fit to ſupport Chriſtianity which was almoſt decay'd. And then falling down proſtrate before the Pope, he kiſs'd his feet with great Veneration; whilſt the Pope on the contrary em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, and valued him as a Brother, and gave him thanks, that by his means and induſtry Peace was reſtored once more to the Church of God. But the reaſon why he would be called Pope <hi>Martin</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Election was upon S. <hi>Martins</hi> day. Whilſt theſe things were tranſacted at <hi>Conſtance, Ladiſlaus</hi> dying as he was going againſt the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> the cry at <hi>Rome</hi> was, <hi>To Arms,</hi> and <hi>for Liberty.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Peter Mattheucii</hi> was forced againſt his Will to aſſume the Government of the City, though afterward he relinquiſh'd the Office, when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that a Legate whom Pope <hi>John</hi> had deſign'd to ſend thither, would ſhortly come with a Senator of <hi>Bologna.</hi> As ſoon as they were come, they put <hi>Paul Palonius,</hi> and <hi>John Cincius,</hi> two ſeditious Citizens, to death. The year following <hi>Brachius Montonius</hi> came with an Army to <hi>Rome,</hi> and getting into the City, began to ſtorm the Caſtle S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi> which was defended by a ſtrong Gariſon of Queen <hi>Joans;</hi> who ſucceeded her Brother <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> in the Kingdom. But when <hi>Sfortia,</hi> the Queens General, came up, he not onely raiſed the Siege, but beat <hi>Brachius</hi> out of the City, the <hi>Romans</hi> ſiding with neither Party. <hi>John Columna</hi> was kill'd in that fight by a private Soldier, that formerly had fought under <hi>Paul <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin,</hi> whom <hi>Lewis Columna,</hi> in <hi>Brachius</hi>'s Army, had formerly kill'd at <hi>Fuligno.</hi> Now the Soldier had a mind to kill <hi>Lewis,</hi> to revenge <hi>Pauls</hi> death, but <hi>John</hi> who was innocent died for it as he was going to ſave <hi>Lewis.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Rome</hi> was in this tempeſtuous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rowing to and fro, it conceived at length ſome hope of quiet, upon <hi>Martin</hi>'s being choſen.</p>

For he had been well educated by his Parents care from his Childhood, and when he grew up, he ſtudied the Canon Law at <hi>Perugia,</hi> from whence he return'd to the City and for his integrity and learning was made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferendary by Pope <hi>

For he was more courteous than before, and lent his aſſiſtance to all that wanted it, yet ſo, as not to meddle much in publick matters. So that when there were many Debates in the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> by

reaſon of the Factions, he took the middle way, and ſeemed to incline to neither Party, but always ſtudied the general good: Being therefore beloved by the Emperor, the Cardinals, and indeed by all Men, he was choſen Pope, In which Office he was not idle, but active and careful, hearing, refuting, and approving; perſuading, diſuading, exhorting, or deterring thoſe that came before him according to reaſon and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the Cauſe. For he was very acceſſible; and never denied a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable requeſt; beſides that he was a Man of great prudence in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates. For he would tell what ought to be done, as ſoon as a thing was propoſed to him. He was ſhort in his Speeches, and wary in his Actions, inſomuch that people ſaw a thing effected before they could imagine he had thought of it. His Diſcourſe was full of Sentences; nor did any word come from him ſo often, as [Juſtice:] frequently turning to his Attendants and Familiars, eſpecially them that govern'd Cities and Provinces, and ſaying; <hi>Love Juſtice, ye that judg the Earth.</hi> Indeed the Church of God wanted ſuch a Pope at that time, to ſit at the Helm, and ſteer S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Boat (then batter'd with Waves of Schiſm and Sedition) into a ſafe Port. He therefore having obtained this great Dignity, and ſeeing the Hydras head which might grow out again and multiply, was ſtill left; (that is, <hi>Benedict,</hi> formerly called <hi>Peter Luna,</hi> who kept with ſome few Cardinals and Prelates in a place that might be called the very Fort of Schiſm.) Whilſt ſome People of <hi>Aragon</hi> were at a ſtand which way to incline, He, by approbation of the Council ſent <hi>Alemannus Ademarius</hi> a very learned Man (whoſe Tomb is ſtill to be ſeen in new S. <hi>Maries</hi>) a <hi>Florentine,</hi> and Cardinal of S. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> as Legate <hi>à Latere</hi> into <hi>Aragon</hi>; to admoniſh <hi>Peter</hi> upon Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Penalties and Cenſures to reſign the Pontificate. Nay, even the Cardinals that were on <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſide, when they heard this ultimate reſolution of the Pope and Council, went to <hi>Peter</hi> and deſired him, at laſt to remove all Schiſm out of the Church of God, with which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom had been for ſo many years afflicted; and told him, that <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> had done the ſame, in order to ſave the Church from ruin. <hi>Peter</hi> gave 'em ſome ſlight anſwer, and told 'em he could not do it; but he would agree with <hi>Martin,</hi> if all were true which people ſaid of his integrity and humanity: and bid 'em, let him alone to manage the buſineſs, and trouble themſelves no more about it. But of the four Cardinals who went to him, two obſerving his obſtinacy immediately revolted from him to <hi>Martin.</hi> And thoſe two that continued on his ſide were preſently counted Anti-Cardinals: one of which was a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſian,</hi> and the other called <hi>Julian Dobla.</hi> Upon this all <hi>Spain</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>Martins</hi> Authority; and ſo did the <hi>Scots</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Armagnac</hi> not long after. And ſo all Chriſtendom, except one <hi>Peninſula,</hi> owned the Authority of <hi>Martin.</hi> This great Affair thus ſetled by the pains and induſtry of the Eccleſiaſtick and ſecular Princes, eſpecially of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund</hi> the Emperor, they began to talk of reforming the manners of both the Laiety and Clergy, which were debauched with too much Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. But becauſe the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had laſted already four years, to the great inconvenience of Prelates and their Churches, it was <hi>Martin</hi>'s pleaſure, and the Opinion of the Council, that weighty Affair ſhould be deferred till ſome more ſeaſonable opportunity, it being (he ſaid) a work that would require much time and deliberation; becauſe,

as <hi>Jerome</hi> ſays, every Country has its peculiar Manners, and Cuſtoms, which cannot be eaſily remov'd without great diſturbance. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Schiſm from a ſmall beginning had laſted a long time to the great diſadvantage of Chriſtendom, upon notice that <hi>John</hi> XXIII. was eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of cuſtody, fearing leſt he ſhould call another Council, he publiſh'd a Decree concerning the calling of Councils, That from the end of the Council at <hi>Conſtance</hi> no other Council ſhould be held within five years; and after that, within ſeven, and from thence it was drawn out to ten years, and was made a Law, That every ten years a General Council ſhould be held in ſome convenient place, to treat of matters of Faith, and the common good of Chriſtendom; In confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, by the approbation of the Council <hi>Martin</hi> publiſh'd his Bulls. But he abrogated all Decrees that were made during the Schiſm, before his Pontificate, except ſuch as were made to promote faith or good manners. That all Men might know he intended to call a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, he publickly adviſed concerning a commodious place for it, and at laſt choſe <hi>Pavia</hi> by general approbation, and gave out his Breves to this purpoſe:
<q>
                     <hi>Martin,</hi> Biſhop, and Servant of Gods Servants (for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remembrance of the thing) being deſirous to have Obedience paid to the Decree of this General Council, upon a Debate had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a Place where the next Council ſhall be holden, we do with the approbation and conſent of the ſaid Council and by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe preſents appoint the City of <hi>Pavia</hi> for that purpoſe. And let no man contravene this our Decree, upon pein of the diſpleaſure of God Almighty and of his Apoſtles SS. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi> Given and enacted at <hi>Conſtance</hi> in the publick Council-Houſe, <hi>April</hi> 18. in the firſt year of our Pontificate.</q>
And now he was willing the Council ſhould be diſſolv'd, wherefore calling a full Aſſembly, with the good liking of the Emperor and of all the reſt, he commanded <hi>Ibaldo</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of S. <hi>Vitus</hi> to diſmiſs them, which he did by ſaying, <hi>Sirs, Depart in peace.</hi> Every one now having leave to be gone, the Pope was deſired, on the one ſide, by the Emperor and the <hi>Germans,</hi> that he would tarry ſome time in their Country, and by the <hi>French</hi> Princes, on the other ſide, to go into <hi>France</hi>; but he told 'em he could not do it by any means, becauſe he ſaid, the Churches Patrimony was torn and ſpoiled by Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in <hi>Italy</hi> whilſt the Pope was abſent; and that the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the Metropolis of Chriſtendom, was almoſt ruin'd for want of the preſence of its Governour, ſo much it had ſuffer'd by Plague, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Sword, Fire, and Sedition; beſide that the Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels of the holy Martyrs, by the Pope's abſence were either in ruins, or ready to fall, and therefore he muſt be gone thither. He deſired 'em to take that kindly which reaſon and neceſſity forced him to, and that they would let him ſit in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair, ſince they had unanimouſly choſen him Pope. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was the Mother and the Head of all other Churches, and therefore the Pope ought to reſide there, leſt the true Pilot ſhould be diſplaced from the Stern, to the Stem, to the great hazard and detriment of both Paſſengers and Sailers, (i.e. all Chriſtian Men.) So he went from <hi>Conſtance</hi> through <hi>Savoy</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Millain:</hi> where he was very kindly received by <hi>Duke Philip</hi> and all his People, who gave him all the reſpect imaginable. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> was at that time in Arms, endeavouring to recover his paternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, which the Uſurpers kept from him with great bravery and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:50681:194"/>
courage; for having once taſted how pleaſant it was to govern, they were not eaſily turn'd out of poſſeſſion. However <hi>Carmignola Philip</hi>'s chief Commander preſs'd <hi>Pandulphus Malateſta</hi> very hard, who having taken <hi>Pergamo,</hi> by bribing the Governour to betray the Caſtle, moved toward <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and would have quickly ſtrip'd him of all his Dominions, had he not been aided by the <hi>Venetians</hi> with great ſums of Money and ſtout Cavalry; or had not Pope <hi>Martin</hi> perſuaded <hi>Philip</hi> to make a Peace with <hi>Pandulphus</hi>: which was accordingly afterward compoſed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon at <hi>Mantoua,</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Martin,</hi> and by the Umpirage of <hi>John Franciſco,</hi> upon theſe terms; to wit, That <hi>Pandulphus</hi> paying a yearly Tribute ſhould keep <hi>Breſcia</hi> ſo long as he lived, but ſhould not have Power to give it away by Will, becauſe at his Death it naturally devolv'd upon <hi>Philip.</hi> But the next year <hi>Pandulphus</hi> broke his Peace, by endeavouring by Men and Money to keep <hi>Cabrinus Fundulus</hi> in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Cremona.</hi> For <hi>Philip</hi> made War againſt him and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to regain the City which was his paternal Inheritance, but had been ſo many years poſſeſs'd by that Uſurper. Yet there was a report that <hi>Pandulphus</hi> had bought the City of <hi>Cabrinus,</hi> and promiſed to give him <hi>Riviera di Salo</hi> for it. But <hi>John Franciſco</hi> ſtrove all he could to keep him from this War, and ſent Embaſſadors to tell him that he did contrary to all Law and Reaſon, in violating of Leagues, defending a Tyrant, and taking up Arms againſt him who gave him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Breſcia.</hi> And that <hi>Martin</hi>'s Authority ought not to be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſay nothing of his own, by whoſe Arbitrement the Peace was made. But if he ſlighted the Authority of Men, at leaſt he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence that of God, whom they had invoked as a witneſs to the League, which he had broken. Soon after the Pope went away from <hi>Mantoua,</hi> in the fourth month after he came thither, and paſſing through <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Romagna</hi> he came to <hi>Florence,</hi> without calling at <hi>Bologna</hi> which he ſhun'd on purpoſe. For when they of <hi>Bologna</hi> heard that <hi>Baldeſar Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> was forced to lay down the Pontificate, they expelled the Church-Officers and aſſerted their Liberty. At that time <hi>Carmignola</hi> preſs'd hard upon <hi>Pandulphus</hi> (by his breach of the Peace made juſtly obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to a War) and in a ſhort ſpace took a great part of the Country of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and pitch'd his Camp at <hi>Montclere,</hi> there to encounter <hi>Lewis Meliorat</hi> Nephew to <hi>Innocent</hi> VII. who was ſaid to be coming with a great Body of Horſe to help <hi>Pandulphus.</hi> For they two were kindred by Marriage, and <hi>Lewis</hi> did it in reſpect to his Relation. So they join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Battel, wherein <hi>Lewis</hi> was baſely routed; and not long after <hi>Carmig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> reduced <hi>Breſcia</hi> and made it ſubject to <hi>Philip:</hi> who alſo within a little while was Maſter of <hi>Cremona,</hi> and put <hi>Cabrinus</hi> the Uſurper to Death. <hi>Nicolas d' Eſte</hi> being mov'd at <hi>Philip</hi>'s great ſucceſs, went of his own accord, and did what he might have been forced to; that is, he went to <hi>Millain</hi> and reſtored <hi>Parma</hi> (which he poſſeſs'd himſelf of when <hi>Otho</hi> the Third died) to <hi>Philip,</hi> but kept <hi>Rheggio,</hi> at the requeſt of Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> as a Fee. Thither alſo went <hi>John Francis</hi> Prince of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> to congratulate <hi>Philip</hi>'s Succeſſes. But when he ſaw <hi>Philip</hi> look gruffly upon him, and underſtood that he deſign'd to renew his Claim to all that he held of the <hi>Cremoneſes</hi> and the <hi>Breſcians,</hi> he went from <hi>Millain</hi> in haſte, and enter'd into Alliance with the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and <hi>Venetians.</hi> For thoſe two States were very timorous, and took pains to
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:50681:194"/>
draw over whom they could to their Party; becauſe <hi>Philip,</hi> who loved Dominion, had broken the League with them, and not onely given <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zana</hi> upon the River <hi>Magra,</hi> to <hi>Thomas Fregoſo</hi> (whom he had expelled from his Principality leſt he ſhould join with the <hi>Bandittoes</hi> of <hi>Genoa</hi> againſt him) but alſo had incited the <hi>Bolognians,</hi> who were Allies of the <hi>Florentines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to revolt, and in order to it hired their Soldiers to fight under him; nay he had got poſſeſſion of <hi>Forli</hi> under colour of the non-age of <hi>Theobald,</hi> or to gratifie the Prince of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> whereas there was a proviſo in the League, that <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould not meddle with <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Romagna.</hi> They feared likewiſe, leſt all would be carried by the power of the three mighty Princes, to wit, <hi>Philip,</hi> Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> and King <hi>Lewis,</hi> whom they knew to be Confederates. Whereas on the other ſide <hi>Philip</hi> laid all the fault upon the <hi>Venetians,</hi> becauſe they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to keep <hi>Pandulphus</hi> in the Government of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and becauſe the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Genoeſes</hi> had aſſiſted ſome of his Enemies with Money and Ammunition, and had bought <hi>Legorne,</hi> (which he had lately Conquer'd) of the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> for an hundred thouſand pounds. Theſe ſeeds of Diſcord might ſeem enough to raiſe a War at that time, but nothing did more ſet on the <hi>Venetians,</hi> than the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Carmignola,</hi> a perſon mightily famed for warlike Diſcipline, as any of that Age. This perſon could not endure (as he uſed to ſay himſelf) the inſolence of <hi>Philip</hi> and therefore came over to the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and animating them to War promiſed to aſſiſt 'em with his utmoſt. Whereupon theſe two States, aſſiſted by the Princes of <hi>Mantoua</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> and going Partners in the charge of the War, ſet out an Army of twelve thouſand Horſe and eight thouſand Foot, over whom <hi>Carmig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> was General. And then ſetting upon <hi>Philip</hi> from every quarter at once, with Boats upon the River as well as Ships upon the Sea, they were invited into the Town by the <hi>Guelphs</hi> of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> who were againſt <hi>Philip.</hi> And having ſeized ſome part of it, they reduced it all into their own power within ſeven months. Then <hi>Carmignola</hi> led them to take the Caſtles which belonged to <hi>Breſcia,</hi> when Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> very much concerned for <hi>Philips</hi> misfortune, ſent the Cardinal of S. <hi>Croſſes</hi> to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to mediate between them and <hi>Philip.</hi> But that did not ſucceed, becauſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> made unreaſonable Demands, and ſo they began again mighty preparations for a War. They fought thrice in that year, firſt at <hi>Cotolengo,</hi> a Caſtle of <hi>Breſcia</hi>; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time at the upper part of <hi>Cremona</hi> (in which two places they parted pretty equal, and neither had the better on't) and the third time at <hi>Maclodio</hi>; where <hi>Philip</hi> was defeated, and <hi>Charles Malateſta</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral taken. This was ſo great an overthrow, that if <hi>Carmignola</hi> would have kept the Soldiers that he took, and have purſu'd 'em whilſt they were in ſuch a conſternation, it had been no great pains to have turn'd <hi>Philip</hi> out of his Principality. <hi>Charles</hi> (I told you) was taken in that Battel, but was ſent away ſafe by the Prince of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> his Kinſman; But <hi>Carmignola</hi> employing the Army againſt the Towns belonging to the <hi>Breſcians,</hi> which had continu'd in their Allegiance to <hi>Philip,</hi> he gave him time to breath upon it. For he not onely made Peace with <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> (who lay hard upon him) yielding him <hi>Vercelli</hi>; but he inſtigated the Emperor <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> and <hi>Branorus Scala</hi> againſt the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians.</hi> But Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Philip</hi> in ſuch dangerous Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſent the Cardinal of S. <hi>Croſſes</hi> again to make peace between him
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:50681:195"/>
and the <hi>Venetians:</hi> who ſtaying at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> till the ſeveral Embaſſadors of the Princes and Cities came with inſtructions, he made a Peace upon theſe Conditions, That the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould keep <hi>Breſcia</hi> and all the Towns belonging to the <hi>Breſcians</hi> or <hi>Cremoneſes,</hi> which they had taken; that <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould ſurrender <hi>Bergamo</hi> and all that appertain'd to it to the <hi>Venetians</hi>; and that he ſhould not moleſt their Allies, or thoſe of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> or perſwade any of 'em to revolt. <hi>Martin</hi> approved of this Peace, for fear <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould be quite turn'd out of his Dutchy. For as he could not be his Friend (though he loved him well) upon the account of Religion: ſo neither could he then eſpecially, becauſe at that time the Church-Treaſury had been exhauſted for ſeveral years by the War againſt <hi>Brachius.</hi> For when he went to <hi>Florence,</hi> he found <hi>Brachius Montonius,</hi> an excellent Soldier, had ſo far got poſſeſſion of <hi>Perugia,</hi> the Dutchy of <hi>Spoleto,</hi> and great part of the Churches Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (by help of the Uſurpers round about) that he could not get ſafe to <hi>Rome.</hi> But when <hi>Brachius</hi> upon Admonition would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, the Pope uſed firſt of all ſpiritual Weapons, that is, Cenſures, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and interdicted all his Adherents, nor were the Prieſts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to do their Office in the uſual places. At which misfortune of their Friend <hi>Brachius</hi> the <hi>Florentines</hi> were concern'd, and treated with <hi>Martin</hi> for Peace, upon Condition, that <hi>Brachius</hi> ſhould throw himſelf at the Popes feet and ask pardon, which he did. And that he ſhould reſtore ſome Towns to the Church, and fight under the Pope till he had reduced <hi>Bologna</hi> which was then in Rebellion, and made it ſubject to <hi>Martin.</hi> In which War <hi>Gabriel Condelmer,</hi> Cardinal-Prieſt of S. <hi>Clements,</hi> and Legate, was General; who by his induſtry and <hi>Brachius</hi>'s Valour ſubdu'd <hi>Bologna</hi> in a ſhort time, and made it tributary to the Church. Whilſt theſe things were tranſacted in <hi>Bologna,</hi> the four Cardinals, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly of <hi>Peter Luna</hi>'s party, the Anti-Pope, came to <hi>Martin</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> where they were receiv'd moſt honourably by the whole Conſiſtory, and retein'd their former Dignities. Three were Cardinal-Deacons, but the fourth, who was formerly a Canon Regular, was a Cardinal-Prieſt. <hi>Baldeſar Coſſa</hi> being ſtill a Priſoner at <hi>Heidelberg</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> under the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> ſome Citizens of <hi>Florence</hi> (of which <hi>Coſmus</hi> was one) were urgent with Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> to ſet him at liberty: The Pope pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, he would: but whilſt his Legate went thither to perform it, <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſar,</hi> being impatient of ſtaying any longer, gave the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> thirty thouſand pounds to free him: And coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> he went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly toward <hi>Florence,</hi> but call'd upon <hi>Peter Rubeus</hi> a Baron of <hi>Parma,</hi> and an old Friend of his, where he underſtood that there was wait laid for him. Thereupon he fled by Night, along with the Legate whom he met by the way, to <hi>Thomas Fregoſos,</hi> another old Friend of his, and gave people a ſuſpition that the Schiſm would be renew'd. For he was a Man of great Courage, and very cunning, nor could he endure a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life. Beſides, there were not wanting ſuch as would incite the bold Man to innovations, they were generally at that time ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Novelties. But God Almighty took pity on his Church and put <hi>Baldeſar</hi> upon a reſolution of going to <hi>Martin</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> without any Articles of Agreement, or any Caution, between them. When he came thither and had kiſs'd the Popes foot (to the admiration of all that ſaw it) he ſaluted him in the preſence and hearing of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, by the name of Chriſt's true Vicar, and a true Pope canonical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:50681:195"/>
elected. This was ſtrange to all that ſaw it, and brought to paſs, it ſhould ſeem, rather by Gods providence than any humane skill: That a Man, covetous of Dominion, and in ſuch an high Station before, ſhould be ſo ſupple in a place where he might be free, becauſe he was loved by all. But it made every body cry for joy, eſpecially thoſe Cardinals, that had acknowledged him as the true Pope. But <hi>Martin</hi> conſidering the viciſſitude, or changeableneſs of humane Affairs, made him a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal in few days, and then Biſhop of <hi>Fraſcati</hi>; after which he ſhew'd him as much reſpect as any other Cardinal, both in publick and private. But <hi>Baldeſar</hi> (ſome think) died of grief in a few months after, at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> (as being unable to endure a private life) and was buried moſt honourably in S. <hi>Johns</hi> Church, nor far from the Cathedral, at the great coſt and charges of <hi>Coſmo di Medices,</hi> who grew ſo rich with <hi>Baldeſars</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that he was look'd upon as the chief Man in <hi>Florence</hi> of a Citizen, nay perhaps the richeſt in <hi>Italy,</hi> or the World. Upon his Tomb were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten theſe words: <hi>BALDESARIS COSSAE, JOHANNIS</hi> XXIII. <hi>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ONDAM PAPAE CORP<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S HOC T<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LO CONDIT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>M.</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe Actions at <hi>Florence,</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>'s Agents came to the Pope, and promiſed that the <hi>Greeks</hi> would come over to the <hi>Latins</hi> in all points of Faith upon reaſonable terms. The Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them very kindly and ſplendidly, and made <hi>Peter Fonteſiccus</hi> (a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and a very learned Man) Legate <hi>à La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere,</hi> to go to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and ſettle matters there. But before he ſent the good Man away, he diſpatch'd Frier <hi>Anthony Maſſanus</hi> thither, (who was General of the <hi>Minors</hi>) to find how the Emperor and the <hi>Greeks</hi> were affected, and tell him what he might truſt to. Now the <hi>Romans</hi> were ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to have him come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore taking his leave very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> he made their City a Metropolis. For though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, even from its foundation almoſt, it had only had the honour of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, he made it an Arch-Biſhoprick, and the Mother-Church to <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterra, Piſtoia,</hi> and <hi>Fieſola.</hi> He alſo gave a bigger Altar to S. <hi>Mary</hi> the New, belonging to the Order of <hi>Preachers,</hi> where he lived all the while he was at <hi>Florence</hi>; that Convent being very commodious for his recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. At laſt, parting from <hi>Florence</hi> he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple met him; and the Nobility look'd upon him as the good Genius, or Father of their Country.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 21. 1421<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> And that day the <hi>Romans</hi> put in their Calendar as a lucky one. When he came he found the City of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo ruinated, that it look'd nothing like a City. You might have ſeen the Houſes ready to totter, the Churches fallen down, the Streets empty, the City full of Dirt and Mire, and in exteam want of all ſorts of proviſions. What ſhould I ſay more? There was neither the face of a City, nor any ſign of civility there, the Citizens ſeeming rather Sojourners and Vagabonds. The good Pope was troubled to ſee it, and apply'd himſelf to adorning of the City, and reforming the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens manners, ſo that in a ſhort time it looked much better than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For this reaſon he was called by the People not onely the True Pope, but Father of his Country. But leſt that publick joy ſhould laſt too long without interruption, the year following in <hi>November,</hi> on St. <hi>Andrews</hi> Eve, the <hi>Tiber</hi> ſwell'd ſo high, that it came in at the <hi>Porta del popolo,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow'd the whole City, (which lies upon a level) and filled the Church of S. <hi>Mary</hi> the round as far as the great Altar. Two days after it fell,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:50681:196"/>
but took much Cattel along with it, and did great damage to the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; who ſailed about the Streets, as upon the <hi>Tiber.</hi> Now King <hi>Lewis,</hi> Son to <hi>Lewis</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and obtain'd of <hi>Martin</hi> to be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted King of <hi>Naples,</hi> by general conſent of the Cardinals. For he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been invited thither and adopted by Queen <hi>Joan,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Ladiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> expected by this means to get the Kingdom without fighting, but was driven out of <hi>Naples</hi> by a contrary Faction and retired to <hi>Calabria.</hi> And now the time for the Council drawing near (according to the Decree at <hi>Conſtance</hi>) <hi>Martin</hi> was pleaſed, by conſent of the Cardinals, to ſend ſome Biſhops before to <hi>Pavia,</hi> to begin it: that ſeeming to be the moſt commodious place for it. Thither therefore he immediately ſent <hi>Peter Donatus,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Candia, James Camplo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leto, Peter Roſatius</hi> Abbot of <hi>Aquilegia,</hi> Frier <hi>Leonard</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> and General of the <hi>Preachers,</hi> to open the Council; But they found no body yet come from <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> onely two Abbots of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>; therefore they thought fit to defer it, till one at leaſt ſhould be come from each Nation, little of moment being to be tranſacted without uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſent. But while they waited their coming, on a ſudden <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> was viſited ſo ſeverely with a Plague, that with the Popes leave, the Preſidents of the Council remov'd to <hi>Sienna</hi>; whither people came from all Nations more readily and in greater numbers than to <hi>Pavia. Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> (who was an Enemy to <hi>Martin</hi> for giving the Title of <hi>King of Naples and Sicily</hi> to <hi>Lewis,</hi> which himſelf deſired) ſent his Embaſſador to the Council with Order to delay it as much as he could, and to bring about the Cauſe of the Anti-pope <hi>Peter Luna</hi> (yet alive in <hi>Paniſchola</hi>) either by Promiſes or Bribes to thoſe who had greateſt Authority in the Council. Wherefore <hi>Martin</hi> (who knew very well, how great a calamity ſuch a thing would bring upon the Church, and what danger there was in delays) commanded the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to be immediately diſſolv'd, approving firſt of the Decrees made in it, that concern'd matters of Faith. And leſt he might ſeem to fear a General Council, he order'd that another ſhould be held at <hi>Baſil</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years after. Thus did that prudent, ſubtil Man root out the ſeeds of Schiſm and Diſcord that were ſown in the Council of <hi>Siena. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> then complain'd of <hi>Martin</hi> publickly, that by his means he was put by the Kingdom which <hi>Joan</hi> deſigned for him, and <hi>Lewis</hi> was made Heir in his room. <hi>Martin</hi> eaſily confuted this charge, and told him that <hi>Lewis</hi> was confirm'd Heir to <hi>Joan</hi> by <hi>Alexander</hi> V. and <hi>John</hi> XXIII. long before: and that all the blame ought to be laid on the Queen, and not upon him, whoſe buſineſs it was to ſtrengthen rather than weaken the Churches Feudataries, unleſs they had committed ſome heinous Offence againſt the Sea of <hi>Rome:</hi> and that he did not ſee, why <hi>Lewis</hi> might not be lawful Heir to <hi>Joan</hi> who was Crown'd by his Order. But when <hi>Brachius</hi> ſaw the Pope involv'd in ſo many Affairs, and ſo diſtracted by reaſon of the quarrel between him and <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> he got many of the Church-Towns by force, and laid cloſe Siege to <hi>Aquila</hi> a City in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> The Pope was angry at that, and raiſing a good ſufficient Army, he attempted to relieve <hi>Aquila,</hi> aſſiſted by the Army of the Queen and <hi>Lewis,</hi> and not far from <hi>Aquila</hi> he conquer'd and kill'd <hi>Brachius</hi> in the open Field. The <hi>Sfortians</hi> were in that Battel, under the conduct of <hi>Francis</hi> Son to <hi>Sforza,</hi> who ſome
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:50681:196"/>
years before going over the River <hi>Piſcara</hi> (which the Ancients call'd <hi>Aternus</hi>) was drown'd. <hi>Brachius</hi>'s body was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in an unhallow'd place without the <hi>Porta di Sancto Lorenzo.</hi> Upon this Victory there was ſo great tranquillity (beſides that <hi>Perugia, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſi</hi> with ſome other Towns which <hi>Brachius</hi> had poſſeſſion of were reduced to the Church) that they thought <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s happy days were come again into the World. Then people lived at eaſe, and could walk even in the Night through the Woods without any danger; no Robbers being abroad, no Ruſſians and Thieves; for he cut off <hi>Tartalia, Lauellus,</hi> and other Uſurpers, that got their living rather by Rapine, than War. But the Hereticks of <hi>Bohemia</hi> who plagu'd the Catholicks of <hi>Germany</hi> continually with Hereſie and Arms, ſeemed to interrupt this Peace and happineſs. To make them therefore ſubmit to Reaſon and to the Church, he admoniſh'd them firſt of all very gravely, and when that would not do, he ſent Legats into <hi>Germany,</hi> to ſtir up the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks to Arms. And firſt he ſent <hi>Henry,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Euſebius</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, alone, then <hi>Bartholomew</hi> of <hi>Piacenza</hi>; and laſt of all he recall'd them, and ſent <hi>Julian Caeſarinus</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> who receiv'd great damage from the Enemy, not by his own fault, but by the cowardiſe of his Soldiers. However <hi>Martin</hi> was not diſcouraged at it, but made greater preparations againſt the Hereticks; onely before he ſet about ſuch a grand Affair, he reſolv'd to compoſe and quiet <hi>Italy.</hi> For when the Peace was made by <hi>Martin</hi> between <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Florentines</hi> bore a grudg at <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> Son to <hi>Paul Guiniſius,</hi> Lord of <hi>Luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> for the aſſiſtance he gave <hi>Philip</hi> in the preceding War, and now he not being mention'd in the Articles of that Peace, they laid hold on it as a fair opportunity to ſubdue the City, and having raiſed an Army under <hi>Nicolas Fortebrachius</hi> and taken ſome Caſtles thereabout, they laid Siege to it. Whereupon <hi>Philip</hi> by the entreaty of <hi>Paul,</hi> and for fear leſt if <hi>Lucca</hi> fell into the hands of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> he ſhould find them the ſharper, as being the nearer Enemies, he firſt ſent <hi>Francis Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> into <hi>Parma</hi> with a great body of Horſe, to raiſe Foot-ſoldiers there. Who paſſing the <hi>Apennine</hi> in the beginning of Spring put the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> into ſuch a fright, that before he came into the <hi>Cloudy Vale</hi> (as the Inhabitants call it) the Enemies had removed their Camp, and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Siege from before <hi>Lucca,</hi> out of fear. And his coming was ſo much the more welcome to the <hi>Lucceſes,</hi> becauſe when their Enemies were ſubdu'd and the Uſurper taken, they thought to become abſolute freemen by <hi>Francis</hi>'s aſſiſtance. But the <hi>Florentines</hi> bribing <hi>Francis</hi> with fifty thouſand pounds, he left the people of <hi>Lucca</hi> in a worſe condition than ever; having promiſed for that Sum not to ſerve <hi>Philip</hi> for ſix months. Then the <hi>Lucceſes</hi> were beſieged more cloſe than before: Whereupon <hi>Philip</hi> at the requeſt of <hi>Martin</hi> (who alſo pitied the caſe of the <hi>Lucceſes</hi>) ſent. <hi>Nicolas Piceninus</hi> thither with a great Body of Horſe preſently; who vanquiſh'd and routed the Enemy, and not only raiſed the Siege, but march'd thence, and took many Caſtles belonging to <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Volaterra</hi> by ſtorm, and did the <hi>Sieneſes</hi> a kindneſs, who then made War upon the <hi>Florentines. Martin</hi> being now undiſturb'd by any forein Foe, apply'd his mind to adorn the City, and Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to that purpoſe, repaired the Portico of S. <hi>Peters</hi> which was falling down, and paved the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church with Moſaic work,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:50681:197"/>
cieled it anew; and began thoſe Paintings there which were done by the hand of the famous <hi>Gentilis.</hi> He likewiſe repaired the old Palace that was ready to fall, near the Twelve Apoſtles, where he lived ſome years. The Cardinals follow'd his Example, and re-edified their Churches as faſt as they could; ſo that now <hi>Rome</hi> look'd ſomething like a City. He alſo created certain Cardinals, of which his Nephew <hi>Proſper Columna,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>George,</hi> was one. In the mean time <hi>Peter Luna</hi> dy'd at <hi>Paniſchola,</hi> but leſt the Church ſhould be at quiet, thoſe two Anti-Cardinals, that I told you of, were perſuaded by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> who was <hi>Martin</hi>'s Enemy, to chooſe <hi>Giles Munio</hi> (a Canon of <hi>Barſelona,</hi> and a Nobleman) Pope, and call'd him <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. He was no ſooner choſen, but he made Cardinals and acted as Pope. But when <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> were friends again, he ſent <hi>Peter de Fuſo</hi> a Cardinal, as Legate from the Sea Apoſtolick thither: to whom <hi>Giles</hi> reſign'd his Title to the Popedom, at the command of <hi>Alphonſo.</hi> For which <hi>Martin</hi> was ſo kind to him afterward, that he made him Biſhop of <hi>Majorca.</hi> And the Cardinals alſo that were made by <hi>Giles</hi> did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily lay down their Dignity. But thoſe two that <hi>Peter Luna</hi> made remain'd ſtill obſtinate, and therefore becauſe they would not obey the Pope, the Legate put them in Priſon. Thus <hi>Martin</hi>'s induſtry and prudence removed the Schiſm from all parts; and when the Church was ſetled he uſed as much skill and diſcretion in conferring of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. For he did not beſtow 'em upon every one that ask'd him, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd who was fitteſt to receive them, and to take ſuch a charge upon him. And if he did not know any body in the Country where Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices fell, he uſed to ſend and enquire of thoſe that knew the place who was qualified with Learning, Birth, or breeding fit for any Office. And thus did he advance the Church and deſerving Men at the ſame time, to his great Honour. In fine, ſo couragious and reſolute he was, that though he had two Brothers, the elder of which (<hi>Jorda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi>) died of the Plague, and the other (<hi>Lorenzo</hi>) was burn'd to death in a Turret which was caſually ſet on fire, he was not known to ſay, or do any thing, that argued Impatience, or lowneſs of mind. But this ſame Perſon ſo exactly good in the whole courſe of his life, died at <hi>Rome</hi> of an Apoplexy in the fourteenth year and the third month of his Pontificate, and the ſixty third year of his Age: and was by his own Order buried in S. <hi>Johns</hi> Church near the Heads of the Apoſtles, in a brazen Tomb, and attended by all the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Clergy, weeping as if the Church of God, and the City of <hi>Rome</hi> had been bereft of their onely and their beſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. The Sea at that time was vacant twelve days.</p>

When <hi>Gregory</hi> XII. was made Pope (who was of the Family of <hi>Coraro,</hi> and a <hi>Venetian</hi>) <hi>Anthony Corar Gregory</hi>'s Nephew, a Canon of S. <hi>Georges</hi> in <hi>Alga</hi> going to <hi>Rome,</hi> took <hi>Gabriel Condelmero,</hi> who was of the ſame profeſſion and had lived with him from his Childhood, along with him ſomewhat againſt his will. <hi>Gregory</hi> was ſo taken with his Wit and Parts, that he firſt made him his Treaſurer, and then Biſhop of <hi>Siena,</hi> having made his Nephew <hi>Anthony</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bologna.</hi> The <hi>Sieneſes</hi> refuſed <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> at firſt, and would not have him for their Biſhop; alledging that a Foreiner ought not to be ſet over them in that high Function, but one that knew the cuſtoms and uſages of their City. But when <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> afterward upon a diſtruſt of his condition, left <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Lucca,</hi> and encreaſed the number of Cardinals, he made <hi>Anthony</hi> his Nephew and <hi>Gabriel Condelmero</hi> two, who was made uſe of by <hi>Gregory</hi> after that, and (when he was turn'd out) by <hi>Martin</hi> in many great Affairs; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the Embaſſy to the <hi>Marcha d' Ancona,</hi> in which he not only confirm'd the Inhabitants in their Allegiance to the Church, by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome ſeditious Conſpirators, but alſo repaired the Church of S. <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> at <hi>Ancona,</hi> which was decay'd, and the Port of the ſame City which was Weather-beaten, very old, and ruinous; ſo as to make it like <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans.</hi> And afterward when <hi>Martin</hi> underſtood that the <hi>Bolognians</hi> were ſet upon innovations, he ſent <hi>Gabriel</hi> from <hi>Ancona</hi> thither, who ſuppreſs'd the Sedition as ſoon as he came. Where coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Martin</hi> ſoon after dying, he alone was thought fit to be made Pope, out of eighteen Cardinals, who at that time were in the Conclave, and changing his name to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> was brought immediatey to S. <hi>Peters,</hi> attended by all the People and Clergy, in the year 1431. <hi>March</hi> 3d. And having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Papal Crown he went to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and from thence to the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where he ſet a day for a general Conſiſtory to be held. At which there was ſuch a Concourſe of People, that the Timber of the building where they met, (and where the publick Conſiſtory now ſtands) gave way, and put the people into ſuch a conſternation, that the Biſhop of <hi>Sinigaglia,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Family of <hi>Mella,</hi> was trodden to death in the throng: For the Popes Houſe was not built at that time as it is now. When the Conſiſtory was diſmiſs'd, <hi>Eugenius</hi> took all care to avoid Tumults. But ſome Sycophants perſuading him that <hi>Martin</hi> who was very covetous had left ſomewhere a great Treaſure behind him, of which he might be inform'd by <hi>Martin</hi>'s Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; they made the Man ſo mad, that he commanded <hi>Oddo Poccio Martin</hi>'s Vice-Chamberlain to be laid hold on, and gave the charge of the buſineſs to <hi>Stephen Colonna</hi> his General (the onely perſon of his Party among the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s) Cardinal <hi>

<pb n="358" facs="tcp:50681:198"/>
done againſt the <hi>Colonneſes,</hi> out of an old grudg between the two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. <hi>Eugenius</hi> however commanded that <hi>Oddo</hi> ſhould be brought to him quietly and civily which was quite contrarily executed by <hi>Stephen.</hi> For not onely his goods were plunder'd by the Soldiers, but he was carried by force, or rather dragg'd like a Robber publickly into the Pope's preſence. <hi>Eugenius</hi> was very angry at this rude uſage of him, and check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Stephen</hi> for it; nay threaten'd to puniſh him ſeverely for bringing not onely <hi>Oddo</hi> but the Biſhop of <hi>Tivoli,</hi> who was formerly <hi>Martin</hi>'s Chamberlain, before him after ſuch an unworthy manner. Hereupon <hi>Stephen</hi> fearing the Popes diſpleaſure fled to <hi>Paleſtrina,</hi> to Prince <hi>Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and deſired him to join with him, to drive <hi>Eugenius</hi> from the City, becauſe, he ſaid, <hi>Eugenius</hi> had a Deſign to extinguiſh the whole Family of <hi>Colonna.</hi> And that he knew that to be ſo; for he was privy to it himſelf, and that he ran away from the City, becauſe he knew that he alſo muſt bear a part in that common Calamity, unleſs they all avoided it together. The Prince moved with what he ſaid, and with the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of ſuch as had been <hi>Martin</hi>'s Friends, took up Arms and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſolv'd to ſet upon the Pope, ſtaying onely a little, till his Brother <hi>Proſper,</hi> a Cardinal Deacon, whom he had forewarn'd of the buſineſs, could get out of the City. And as ſoon as he ſaw him, he march'd from <hi>Paleſtrina</hi> to <hi>Marino,</hi> and thence to <hi>Rome</hi> againſt <hi>Eugenius</hi>; and having the Gate <hi>di Sancto Sebaſtiano</hi> deliver'd up to him by <hi>John Baptiſta,</hi> he enter'd the Town at firſt without doing any violence. But when they were come as far as S. <hi>Marks,</hi> in the Street called <hi>Colonna,</hi> the Pope's Soldiers met them, aſſiſted by a great number of people. They fought ſome time in the City very ſtoutly; and many were ſlain and taken on both ſides. But the <hi>Colonneſes</hi> ſeeing the People of <hi>Rome</hi> otherwiſe affected than they expected, they reſolv'd to retreat out of the City, but as they went they plunder'd all things, drove away the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and forc'd a great many Men along with 'em. But the Pope's Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, mix'd with the <hi>Romans</hi> requited 'em for it. For they plunder'd and laid waſte the Houſes of <hi>Proſper</hi> the Cardinal, and all the <hi>Colonneſes,</hi> together with all thoſe that had been <hi>Martin</hi>'s Friends. Being thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd on either ſide, they began to make uſe of treachery as well as open force, to bring about their Deſigns. For the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevento,</hi> Son to <hi>Anthony Colonna,</hi> was taken, and one <hi>Maſius</hi> a Frier, who being tortur'd confeſs'd, that he intended to kill the Governour of <hi>Caſtel</hi> S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and ſo taking it by ſurpriſe, to betray it to the <hi>Colonneſes,</hi> who, being once Maſters of that, might drive the Pope and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſins</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they pleaſed. <hi>Maſius</hi> was degraded from the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and quarter'd in <hi>Campo di Fiore,</hi> and his Limbs hung up at the four chief Gates of the City, nothing being ſaid of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Benevento.</hi> But <hi>Eugenius</hi> falling ſick either of grief for theſe troubles or of Poiſon, as ſome ſaid, he clap'd up a Peace with the <hi>Colonneſes</hi> by the mediation of <hi>Angelot Foſcus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, whom he not long after made Cardinal at the ſame time with <hi>Francis Condelmero</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew. This Peace he made publick with as much ſpeed as poſſible, becauſe he underſtood that <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> was come into <hi>Italy,</hi> and deſign'd for <hi>Rome</hi>; upon which he made his Nephew <hi>Francis</hi> Chamberlain: and gave him ſome excellent Perſons for his Aſſiſtants in the management of the Church Patrimony. Whilſt theſe things paſs'd thus at <hi>Rome,</hi> the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:50681:198"/>
                  <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> having routed a Fleet of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Genoa</hi> upon the Coaſt of <hi>Genoa</hi> in a Sea-fight, and having a Pope who was their Country-man, took the confidence to invade <hi>Philip</hi> by Land: But he ſent for <hi>Nicolas Picenninus</hi> immediately out of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and both beat the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet at <hi>Cremona,</hi> and eaſily defeated <hi>Carmignola,</hi> whom the <hi>Venetians</hi> beheaded a little after having firſt (as they ſay themſelves) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed him by Torture, Letters produc'd and Oral teſtimony that it was through his treachery, that they did not take <hi>Cremona,</hi> when <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valcabos</hi> had ſeized one Gate of the City: and that the Navy was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd before his face, when he might eaſily have hinder'd it with ſuch a number of men as he had ſo near. But then the <hi>Florentines</hi> fearing leſt the Emperor now coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhould favour <hi>Philip,</hi> they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd <hi>Nerius Capponius</hi> a Citizen of theirs, if poſſible, to perſuade <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi> that the Emperors coming to the City, did threaten no leſs ruin to the Sea Apoſtolick than to <hi>Florence:</hi> And that it was an eaſie matter to keep him from paſſing over <hi>Arno</hi> into <hi>Siena</hi> (which had moleſted the <hi>Florentines</hi> a long time) if he would command <hi>Nicolas Tollentinas,</hi> then in Arms under the Pope, to join <hi>Michelett Cotignola,</hi> General of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and oppoſe <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> at <hi>Arno,</hi> that he might not paſs the River with his <hi>German</hi> Horſe. <hi>Eugenius</hi> was eaſily perſuaded to it; and upon ſome Debate about the charge of the War, <hi>Nerius</hi> took up the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and agreed that the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſhould pay two thouſand Horſe of <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s raiſing as long as the War laſted. Then <hi>Nicolas Tollenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> at the Pope's command march'd out of his Winter-quarters, and whilſt he pillaged the <hi>Sieneſes,</hi> gave <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> opportunity to paſs the River <hi>Arno</hi> (by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Anthony Pontadera,</hi> who was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Commander, and a bitter Enemy of the <hi>Florentines</hi>) and thence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing through <hi>Volaterra</hi> in ſo peaceable a manner, that his Army ſeemed rather friends than foes, he was received and made welcome wherever he came. The Emperor having tarried ſix months at <hi>Siena,</hi> to the great coſt of that City, and having in vain attempted to make Peace with the <hi>Florentines,</hi> applying himſelf to <hi>Eugenius</hi> he made a League with him, and then went to <hi>Rome</hi>; where he was kindly entertain'd by the people and the Pope, and receiv'd the Imperial Crown: And going from the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where he was crown'd, into the <hi>Lateran</hi> where he lodg'd, he Knighted ſeveral <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> at <hi>Ponte di</hi> S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi> according to cuſtom. And ſome ſay that <hi>Eugenius</hi> waited on him ſo far, and then went back to S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s. After that the Emperor took leave of the Pope, and travelling through the <hi>Marcha d' Ancona,</hi> and <hi>Romagna</hi> he arrived at <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Mantoua.</hi> Where when he had ſtay'd ſome days, he made <hi>John Francis,</hi> Lord of <hi>Mantoua</hi> a Marquis, and married <hi>Barbara,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>John,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> to <hi>Lewis,</hi> Son of <hi>John Francis.</hi> This match was thought an honour to the <hi>Gonzagan</hi> Family, not onely becauſe the Lady was akin to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, but becauſe her Father <hi>John</hi> was an Imperial Elector. At laſt the Emperor departed out of <hi>Italy,</hi> leaving all things in confuſion; but <hi>Nicolas d' Eſte,</hi> Marquis of <hi>Ferrara</hi> was perſuaded by <hi>Philip</hi> to go to <hi>Venice</hi> and exhort them to Peace, and ſo he did, inſomuch that they were induced by the awe he had over 'em, and conſidering their great expences, to ſend Plenipotentiaries to <hi>Ferrara</hi> along with him, where by conſent of <hi>Eugenius, April</hi> 1. 1433. a Peace was concluded upon theſe
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:50681:199"/>
Conditions: to wit, That <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould depart out of <hi>Geradada</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it up to the Marquis of <hi>Monteferrat</hi> and <hi>Orlando Pallaricini,</hi> both whom he had turn'd out of their paternal Inheritance, that all which had been taken from the <hi>Florentines,</hi> the <hi>Sieneſes,</hi> or thoſe of <hi>Lucca</hi> ſhould be return'd to the Owners; and that he ſhould be look'd upon as a common Enemy, that did not reſtore what he had taken in thirty days. Thus having made a Peace in all parts, they hoped for ſome reſt, when on the ſudden the whole ſhock of the War fell upon <hi>Eugenius.</hi> For <hi>Philip</hi> who loved Novelties ſent <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> with a great Army into <hi>Romagna,</hi> pretending to march into <hi>Puglia</hi> (which <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded) to defend thoſe Towns which his Father <hi>Sforza</hi> had poſſeſs'd there. Who marching through <hi>Ancona</hi> and <hi>Ombria</hi> with his Army in good order, ſurpriſed and took them in a moment. And <hi>Philip</hi> not content to do ſo, ſent <hi>Nicolas Fortebrachius,</hi> a valiant and prudent Commander with choſen Horſe ſo ſuddenly againſt <hi>Eugenius</hi> that he was poſſeſs'd of the <hi>Ponte Molle</hi> and the <hi>Porta del popolo,</hi> before it was known that any Enemy approached. This <hi>Nicolas</hi> had formerly fought under <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and by his Commiſſion had ſubdu'd the Governor of <hi>Vetralla</hi> and <hi>Civita Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> by the help of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Galleys that attaqued the Caſtle off the Sea. But when <hi>Nicolas</hi> afterward demanded his pay, <hi>Eugenius</hi> anſwered him, that he had taken as much ſpoil out of the Caſtle, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially out of the Town as would ſatisfie him. At which <hi>Nicolas</hi> was ſo angry, that he went into the parts about <hi>Rome,</hi> and raiſed ſuch tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, taking and driving away ſuch numbers of Men and Cattel, that <hi>Eugenius</hi> was ſome time at a ſtand what to do. The <hi>Romans</hi> flock'd to him with their complaints; but the Pope, who at that time wanted both advice and health, ſent 'em to <hi>Francis</hi> the Chamberlain, who being devoted to idleneſs and pleaſure, gave 'em no other anſwer, but that they over-valued their Cattel (for they often complain'd of the loſs of them) and told 'em that the <hi>Venetians</hi> lived more like Citizens than they without Beaſts and flocks of Cattel. The <hi>Romans</hi> were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at this anſwer, and therefore when <hi>Nicolas</hi> had taken <hi>Tivoli</hi> (beating Count <hi>Tagliacotius</hi> out of it) and <hi>Subiaco,</hi> and drawn all the <hi>Colonneſes</hi> to his party (<hi>Stephen Colonna,</hi> who was always of the other ſide being kill'd by the Prince) they threw off the yoke of Subjection and crying out, <hi>Arms, Arms, Liberty, Liberty,</hi> they beat out all <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Officers and taking <hi>Francis</hi> the Chamberlain Priſoner they created a new Magiſtracy of their own chooſing, conſiſting of ſeven <hi>Romans</hi> whom they called <hi>Governors,</hi> who had power of life and death. But <hi>Eugenius</hi> in ſuch an Hurry not knowing what to do reſolv'd to flee for't. And immediately changing his Habit for that of a Monk, went on ſhipboard in a ſmall Veſſel along with <hi>Arſenius</hi> the Monk down the <hi>Tiber</hi> to <hi>Oſtia.</hi> Whereupon certain <hi>Romans,</hi> that knew of his going, threw Stones and ſhot Arrows at him; for they would fain have kept him there till they had got poſſeſſion of S. <hi>Angelo.</hi> Nevertheleſs <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> went away upon the 7th of <hi>July</hi> and ſailed to <hi>Piſa</hi> firſt, and then to <hi>Florence</hi> in Galleys laid on purpoſe for his paſſage; and then the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> betook themſelves to ſtorm the Caſtle, raiſing Mounds and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks in all places, that might make it more acceſſible to the Enemy. On the other ſide, thoſe of the Caſtle made ſome ſallies upon them; and the Governor thinking it fit to uſe ſome ſtratagem with the people of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:50681:199"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> He (by the aſſiſtance and advice of <hi>Baldeſar Aufido</hi> a cunning Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that defended the lower part of the Caſtle) bad one of his Soldiers that ſallied out, that he ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be taken by the Enemy, and then blame the cruelty and covetouſneſs of him the Governor, and promiſe them that if they would give him ſuch a reward, he would kill the Governor and betray the Caſtle. The Soldier did exactly as he was bid; and when he was taken, ſaid all the ill things he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe againſt <hi>Antony Ridio</hi> (the Governor) and ſwore, he would bring the matter about to their mind. Thereupon being dismiſſed he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Caſtle and hung up <hi>Anthonies</hi> Clothes, with ſomewhat like his Head on top of them, which was viſible a great way off. <hi>Baldeſar</hi> preſently cry'd out, the wicked Fellow was juſtly puniſh'd, and that ſome of the chief <hi>Roman</hi> Commanders might now come in, and, if they paid the reward, take the Caſtle. They not being aware of the trick, went in, and were ſtrait taken. Immediately there was a joyful noiſe in the Caſtle, and Darts and Bullets were thrown and ſhot upon the <hi>Romans</hi> without. The <hi>Romans</hi> being thus deluded adviſed concerning the enter-change of their Captives, and in order to it, ſet the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Nephew, at Liberty: and unanimouſly ſubmitted to <hi>Eugenius</hi> within five months after they thought to have gain'd their freedom. Then there were Magiſtrates made in the name of the Church, who fortified the Capitol with ſtrong Guards and other proviſions. And after upon the arrival of <hi>John Viteleſchus</hi> (whom they call'd, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch) <hi>Francis</hi> his Nephew being gone to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> a ſudden dread ſeiz'd the <hi>Romans</hi> to ſuch a degree that they durſt not ſo much as open their mouths for fear. For <hi>Viteleſchus</hi> was an imperious and cruel Man, and lived like a Tyrant rather than a Chriſtian. Theſe things were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted at <hi>Rome</hi> whilſt <hi>Alphonſo</hi> beſieged <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Cajetta,</hi> which was ſtoutly defended by the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Merchants: and the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> thinking it their duty to aſſiſt their Countrymen, fitted out a Navy with all ſpeed by the leave and good liking of Duke <hi>Philip Viconti,</hi> who lent 'em ſome Foot-Soldiers; and meeting their Enemy <hi>Alphonſo</hi> not far from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetta</hi> they engaged with him. After a long and a ſharp conflict they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and took him Priſoner, and all his retinue, of which ſome were Princes. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> was brought to <hi>Millain</hi> to <hi>Philip,</hi> but was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd not as a Captive, or an Enemy of the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> but as a King and a Friend. And when he had been treated honourably for ſome days, and preſented by <hi>Philip</hi> with many great gifts, he went into his Kingdom and took <hi>Cajetta</hi> preſently. Upon that the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> were ſo enraged that he ſhould free <hi>Alphonſo</hi> ſo eaſily, whom they had taken with ſuch hazard, that by the advice of <hi>Thomas Fregoſo</hi> they revolted from <hi>Philip,</hi> and made the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> their Duke. Then <hi>Picenninus,</hi> who was ſent againſt the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> receiving news that they perſiſted in their obſtinacy, took <hi>Sarzana,</hi> and marching toward <hi>Piſa,</hi> under pretence to go and help <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> ſpoiled many Caſtles belonging to the <hi>Piſans.</hi> But the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſtopped his career, by ſending for <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> with the Pope's good liking, who was then in poſſeſſion of <hi>Ancona,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd, by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> to be made Lord of it. But <hi>Eugenius</hi> was againſt that; and ſaid, that it became a Pope to preſerve the Church-patrimony even by War, rather than alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it. So they deferred that buſineſs till another opportunity: yet <hi>Francis</hi> in hopes of it, did not onely beat <hi>Picenninus</hi> from the Siege of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:50681:200"/>
                  <hi>Barga,</hi> taking <hi>Lewis Gonzaga</hi> who fought under <hi>Picenninus</hi>; but he laid cloſe Siege to <hi>Lucca</hi> in the name of the <hi>Florentines. Picenninus</hi> was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd from paſſing the <hi>Apennine</hi> to their relief, and therefore promiſed to free them another way. Wherefore he march'd through <hi>Bologna</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any moleſtation (onely taking a Town belonging to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> called <hi>Oriolo</hi>) and being mindful of the <hi>Lucceſes,</hi> he went thither, and in the abſence of <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> vanquiſh'd the <hi>Florentines</hi> and raiſed the Siege of <hi>Lucca.</hi> The Pope being almoſt diſtracted with care, as well becauſe he was ſurrounded with War, as that the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by the Decree of Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> increaſed daily by the conflux of all the Princes of <hi>Spain, France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> who referr'd the caſe of all Chriſtendom to that Council, he contrived how to diſſolve it, and to that purpoſe, would have removed it from <hi>Baſil</hi> to <hi>Bologna</hi> by general conſent of the Cardinals that were there on his ſide. But the Emperor, other Princes and Prelates, then at <hi>Baſil,</hi> did not onely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey the Pope, but admoniſh'd him ſeveral times to come himſelf with his Cardinals to <hi>Baſil,</hi> which was a convenient place that <hi>Martin</hi> had choſen to hold the Council in, or elſe they threaten'd to oppoſe him as a preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricating and an obſtinate perſon. <hi>Eugenius</hi> was moved at their words and confirmed the Council at <hi>Baſil</hi> by a new Breve, giving every one leave to go thither: for he was ſo tormented with Wars on all ſides of him, that he had hardly time to breath. But having recover'd <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſent <hi>John Viteleſchus</hi> thither immediately, who was a Man indeed very fit for buſineſs, but ſavage and ſevere: who marching againſt the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonneſes,</hi> the <hi>Sabelli,</hi> and all the <hi>Gibellin</hi> faction he ſack'd and razed the Caſtle of <hi>Gandulpho</hi> ſtanding on the <hi>Lago Albano,</hi> as alſo <hi>Savello,</hi> and <hi>Borgeto.</hi> He likewiſe took <hi>Alba, Civita Lapuvina, Paleſtrina</hi> and <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatolo,</hi> and ſent all the Inhabitants, that were alive, to <hi>Rome.</hi> Then turning his courſe into <hi>Campagna di Roma</hi> he brought 'em all over to the Church; and having taken <hi>Anthony Pontadera</hi> he hang'd him upon an Olive-Tree at <hi>Fraſelone.</hi> Then coming back to <hi>Rome</hi> he put 'em all in a fear, and pull'd down ſeveral Houſes of Conſpirators, that had taken poſſeſſion of the <hi>Porta Maggiore</hi> in a tumult, and declared them Enemies to the Church. Among the reſt he took one <hi>Pulcellus,</hi> and tortur'd him with red hot Pincers and then hang'd him in <hi>Campo Fiore.</hi> When the <hi>Roman</hi> people complain'd, that the covetouſneſs of ſome rich Men had brought a Famine upon the Country, there was ſo much Wheat immediately brought into the Market by his Order, that there enſued great plenty of all things in a ſhort time; ſo readily were his Commands obey'd. When he had thus ſetled Affairs, he went into the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had lately got poſſeſſion of, and which he ſaid belonged to the Pope and the Church, and there he took the Prince of <hi>Tarento</hi> with two thouſand Horſe and invaded the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Earl of <hi>Nola.</hi> He alſo had like to have taken <hi>Alphonſo</hi> by fraud rather than force, when they had made a Truce, and a Peace was as good as concluded. When he had taken the Towns belonging to the Church he freed the Prince. And going back to <hi>Rome</hi> he demoliſh'd <hi>Paleſtrina,</hi> which was ready to rebel, by the perſuaſion of <hi>Lorenzo Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and turned out the Inhabitants in great numbers to roam about the Country in the year 1435. In which year <hi>Eugenius</hi> went from <hi>Florence,</hi> (having firſt conſecrated the Cathedral Church there) and going to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna</hi>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:50681:200"/>
he built a Fort near that Gate which leads towards <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the Houſe where the Legate now reſides, with a good high and broad Wall (behind eſpecially) and with Turrets. The year after he in a publick Conſiſtory tranſlated the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> (though he had approved of that place) from thence to <hi>Ferrara</hi>; and ſaid that the <hi>Greeks</hi> who had a mind to join with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had choſen that City to meet in. Then the Preſidents of the Council at <hi>Baſil</hi> were very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent with the <hi>Greeks</hi> and did exhort them with Prayers and Promiſes, that they would leave <hi>Eugenius</hi> and come to them. Nor were they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to do ſo onely, but they bragg'd that they would depoſe <hi>Eugenius</hi> too, if he would not come thither alſo. <hi>Eugenius</hi> could not tell for ſome time what to do, but yet he ſent thither, as Legate, one <hi>John Francis Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piteliſta</hi> a Lawyer and a Knight of <hi>Padua,</hi> to plead his cauſe. But when <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperor was dead, by whoſe favour the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> flouriſh'd, and <hi>Albert</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was choſen in his room, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of S. <hi>Croſſes</hi> began the Council of <hi>Ferrara</hi> in the name of <hi>Eugenius. Eugenius</hi> alſo went thither when he heard the Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>John Paleologus,</hi> was coming, with a great many Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of his own, as well as what the <hi>Venetians</hi> for <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s ſake ſent to meet the Emperor leſt any violence ſhould have been offer'd him: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had an account, that certain <hi>French</hi> Gallies were ſent by the Council into the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> with Orders either to bring the Emperor to them, or if they could not do ſo; that, at leaſt, they ſhould keep him from going to <hi>Ferrara.</hi> But <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſo far corrupted the Admiral of thoſe Galleys with Money, that he left the Council at <hi>Baſil</hi> and came over to his Party. When the Emperour came to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> he was entertain'd by <hi>Eugenius,</hi> as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours uſed to be treated. But <hi>Viteleſchus</hi> when he had quieted the Church Dominions, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd ſeveral Prieſts that had pilfer'd certain Jewels out of the Heads of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtles in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church, to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd, and, after that, had put <hi>James Galeſius</hi> and his Accomplices to death for attempting to make Innovations upon the Government, he went to <hi>Ferrara</hi> where in a publick Conſiſtory he was receiv'd into the number of Cardinals with great Honour. For he had been made Cardinal ſix months before at <hi>Bologna</hi>; and then returning with greater Authority, he put the Governour of <hi>Vetralla,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Fuligno</hi> (after he had expell'd him from his uſurp'd Dominion) to death in the Caſtle of <hi>Surio.</hi> But <hi>Eugenius</hi> deſiring to unite the two Churches that were ſo long of different Opinions, in the year 1438, having made ſolemn Prayers and celebrated the Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt, he went to the Council along with the Emperour and Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Emperour being ſeated on a Throne ſuitable to his Dignity, and the other <hi>Greeks</hi> in a place oppoſite to the Pope, the queſtion was firſt ask'd, Whether the <hi>Latins</hi> and the <hi>Greeks</hi> who had been ſo long of different Opinions were willing to be united into one Church? At which they all cry'd out, They would very willingly, provided that their differences, were firſt reconciled by Reaſon. In order to which there were Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations every day between thoſe that the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> had choſen to debate thoſe weighty Points. But there happening a Plague at <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> which continued a good while, it was not ſafe ſtaying there, and therefore the Council was removed to <hi>Florence.</hi> And as ſoon as they
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:50681:201"/>
came thither, <hi>Picenninus</hi> preſently took poſſeſſion of <hi>Forli, Imola, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna</hi> and <hi>Bologna,</hi> by command from <hi>Philip,</hi> with a deſign to thwart <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s intentions, who was a Friend to the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> his Enemies. After that he came back into <hi>Parma,</hi> and raiſing a great body of Horſe he paſſed the <hi>Po,</hi> and took (in a ſhort time) the greater <hi>Caſal,</hi> and <hi>Platina,</hi> my native Country, and all that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had about <hi>Cremona.</hi> Then he routed <hi>Gattamelata</hi> General of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army at <hi>Calvatoni,</hi> and with the Prince of <hi>Mantoua</hi> his Ally, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Breſcia</hi> for ſome months, which was ſtoutly defended by the Citizens and one <hi>Francis Barbar,</hi> a very learned Man and their chief Magiſtrate. Whereupon he paſs'd from thence to ſeize ſeveral Caſtles thereabout, and hinder proviſions from being brought into the City, plundering and deſtroying all the Country as far as <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> ſo that he left the <hi>Venetians</hi> nothing to live upon; but yet all this was not accompliſh'd without great damage to his Men, eſpecially in the dead of Winter which was the time they took to do it. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſecured great part of the Rivers <hi>Menzo, Adige, Lago di Garda,</hi> and <hi>Lago d' Iſeo,</hi> that nothing might be carried that way by Water to the needy Inhabitants. But the fitting up of ſome Ships, that were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of the <hi>Adige</hi> into the <hi>Lago di</hi> S. <hi>Andreas,</hi> and careened below in the <hi>Lago di Garda</hi> near <hi>Forboli,</hi> gave the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſome reſpite. Then ſeeing nevertheleſs that <hi>Picenninus</hi> preſs'd thoſe of <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Vincenza</hi> very hard, the <hi>Venetians</hi> thought themſelves quite loſt, if they did not get a good Commander, and therefore they ſent <hi>James Donatus</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> then in League with 'em, to deſire, that if the <hi>Florentines</hi> had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> or the ſafety and Liberty of <hi>Italy</hi> in general, that they would ſend <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> immediately with all his Forces to <hi>Venice,</hi> now almoſt ruined by the Arms of <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> being concern'd for their own danger as well as that of their Allies, perſuade <hi>Francis</hi> to take up Arms for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and promiſed him in the name of the City, to defend all the Towns that he had, which belong'd to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; which was his greateſt deſire. They alſo got Letters Apoſtolical from <hi>Eugenius</hi> with much ado, to declare <hi>Francis</hi> Marquis and Lord of <hi>Ancona:</hi> but with theſe words, Let him take it, and <hi>the Devil give him luck with it. Francis</hi> going with his Cavalry along the Coaſt of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea fell into <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and paſſing the <hi>Po</hi> in Boats, and having augmented his Army in <hi>Padua</hi> (for he is ſaid to have had twelve thouſand Horſe, and five thouſand Foot) he met the Enemy firſt at <hi>Suave</hi> near <hi>Verona,</hi> where they fought very ſmartly for ſome time and neither had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on't. Afterward <hi>Picenninus</hi> by reaſon of his indiſpoſition, and want of Men, gave way to his Power, and then <hi>Francis</hi> having recover'd all the Caſtles from them of <hi>Vincenza</hi> and <hi>Verona,</hi> he was about to raiſe the Siege from before <hi>Breſcia,</hi> but ſeeing all other Avenues ſtopp'd, he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Adige,</hi> and marching into the parts about <hi>Trent,</hi> he went to <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> a Town he had a mind to take, becauſe the Earl of <hi>Archo</hi> was an Ally of <hi>Philip. Picenninus</hi> alſo came thither, to aſſiſt the Earl; but fighting more eagerly than cautiouſly (as he uſed to do) he was deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reſt of the Army, and receiving great damage was fain to fly into the neighbouring Vallies, where he had been taken by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, if <hi>Charles Gonzaga,</hi> ſon to <hi>John Francis</hi> had not come between him
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:50681:201"/>
and them, and ſo ſaved him from that imminent danger; and yet for all that he was taken afterward, the Foe gathering ſtrength, and carried Priſoner to <hi>Verona.</hi> There are that write, how <hi>Picenninus</hi> was ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd in one ſide with Wounds which he receiv'd in the ſeveral Battels, that he was not able to ride back to his Army, but was wrapp'd in a Sack, as if he had been dead, and ſo carried upon a luſty Fellows ſhoulders even through the Enemies Camp. Whilſt theſe things were tranſacted in <hi>Venice, Philip</hi> taking it ill that the <hi>Florentines</hi> by the help and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of <hi>Eugenius,</hi> had ſent <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> to aid the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thoſe that were at the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> to cite <hi>Eugenius</hi> before 'em; which they did twice or thrice. But when it did not anſwer his expectation, he ſo far infatuated them, as that they depoſed <hi>Eugenius</hi> and choſe <hi>Amadeus</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> (his Father-in-law, who lived like an Hermit at <hi>Ripalia</hi> with ſome other Noblemen) Pope, and called him <hi>Felix.</hi> Hence aroſe great Seditions in the Church of God; for Chriſtendom was divided into three parts, and ſome follow'd <hi>Eugenius,</hi> ſome <hi>Felix,</hi> and the reſt were Neuters. For all that <hi>Eugenius</hi> was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; but held frequent Aſſemblies, and Diſputations between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> till at laſt it came to this reſult, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were convinc'd that the Holy Ghoſt did proceed from the Father and the Son, and that he was <hi>homuſius,</hi> that is of the ſame ſubſtance, and did not come forth from the Father onely, as they formerly believ'd: and that they ought to conſecrate the Body of Chriſt with unleaven'd bread made of Wheat, and to believe a Purgatory. Laſtly, That the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> was Chriſt's true Vicar, and the lawful Succeſſor of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to whom all the Eaſtern as well as Weſtern Churches ought to ſubmit, as being the univerſal Patriarch. The buſineſs thus ſetled, the <hi>Greeks</hi> went away; and then the <hi>Armenians</hi> alſo agreed with us in Faith, their Errors being confuted, and <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Letters to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe promulgated, to ſhew the reaſon why they accorded, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, <hi>Given at the Holy General Council held at</hi> Florence <hi>in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral there,</hi> Novemb. 22. 1439. When that was done he contrived how to ſtrengthen himſelf and at the ſame time weaken the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and that was by making eighteen Cardinals at once in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Conſiſtory: of which number two were <hi>Greeks,</hi> to wit <hi>Rutenus</hi> and <hi>Nicenus</hi>; that the <hi>Greeks</hi> might be kept in the Faith by their example and Authority: and yet that Nation fell back in a little time to its old State. Others were <hi>Peter Barbo</hi> his Siſters Son, and <hi>Alouiſius Patavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> whom he afterward made Patriarch of <hi>Aquilegia</hi> and <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> having advanced <hi>Francis Condelmerius</hi> to the Vicechancelourſhip. Whilſt theſe things were acted near <hi>Trent,</hi> and People thought that <hi>Picenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Mantoua</hi> would yield at laſt, having received ſuch damage, they removed thence with all ſpeed to <hi>Verona</hi> and took it, by the help of Ladders wherewith they ſcal'd the Walls and enter'd in at the <hi>Cittadelle,</hi> unknown to any of the Sentinels, who, to avoid the extream cold of the North Wind (which that Night was very boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,) had quitted their Poſts, and were got into the Tents. But <hi>Francis Sfortia,</hi> when he heard that <hi>Verona</hi> was taken by the Enemy, march'd thither preſently with all his Army, to recover it, knowing that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſtill poſſeſſion of the old Caſtle, and the Fort of S. <hi>Felix</hi> in the Mount. And therefore he enter'd the City that way with his
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:50681:202"/>
Army, and ran upon the Enemy with a mighty ſhout. <hi>Philip</hi>'s Men met him with a few Horſe (for all his Forces were not yet come up) and they fought very ſharply in that part of the City, which they call the <hi>Iſland.</hi> At laſt the few were fain to yield to the many, and <hi>Picen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi> and the <hi>Mantuans</hi> betook themſelves to the new Bridg (as they call it) where for ſome time they bore the ſhock of their Enemies. There, as the Horſe were engaging, and a great many crowded in a little room, the Draw-bridg broke with the weight of Men and Horſes, and almoſt all that fell into the River were drown'd, becauſe they were tired with faſting ſo long, and ſunk by the very weight of their Arms. Thereupon <hi>Francis</hi> flying to a Bridg of Boats, put over his Men and drove <hi>Picenninus</hi> and the <hi>Mantuan</hi> (who diſtruſted the Citizens fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) quite out of the City, within four days after he had taken it. Then <hi>Philip,</hi> that he might draw <hi>Francis</hi> from the <hi>Venetians</hi> by infeſting the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who had given him the ſame pay as the <hi>Venetians</hi> did, ſent <hi>Picenninus</hi> into <hi>Tuſcany</hi> with ſix thouſand Horſe, in the midſt of Winter. The <hi>Florentines</hi> ſeeing that, ſent preſently for <hi>Piergianpaulo,</hi> an excellent Commander, and deſired <hi>Eugenius</hi> that he would aſſiſt 'em ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the League by which he was bound to defend <hi>Tuſcany</hi>; and ſo were reſolv'd to meet <hi>Picenninus.</hi> But when they found that <hi>John Viteleſchus</hi> had conſpired with <hi>Philip,</hi> though he were at that time Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and General of the Church-Forces; and that he would not prove a friend (as he pretended) when he came into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> but an Enemy in the Head of ſix thouſand Horſe, and would fight againſt the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> on <hi>Picenninus</hi>'s ſide, the Magiſtrates of <hi>Florence</hi> contrived by real or feigned Letters (no matter which) from <hi>Eugenius,</hi> to have him kill'd by <hi>Anthony Ridius</hi> the Governour of <hi>Caſtel</hi> S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> juſt as his Men were paſſing the Bridg. And ſo he was; for he could not be aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe that were gone over the Bridg, and therefore was as it were alone, becauſe he brought up the Reer. The Count <hi>Averſus,</hi> who fought under the Patriarch, having loſt his General, convey'd his Carriages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with his own to <hi>Roncillione.</hi> But the <hi>Florentines</hi> being freed from ſo great a Terrour, deal cunningly with <hi>Eugenius,</hi> to let <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Padua</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Viteleſchus,</hi> muſter up all the Church-Forces and come to their aſſiſtance. This <hi>Lewis</hi> was a politick Man, and it was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that by his means <hi>Viteleſchus</hi> was taken off. But <hi>Picenninus</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down into the Vale of <hi>Mugello,</hi> kill'd and plunder'd all before him as far as <hi>Fieſole.</hi> Then turning toward <hi>Caſtentino,</hi> he by the aſſiſtance of Count <hi>Popio</hi> made many Towns revolt. Thence going to <hi>Perugia,</hi> he went quietly into the City, and ſent the Legat who was then Governour there to the Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> upon a certain Meſſage. And in the mean time he took the Treaſurer, and alter'd the whole State of the City. For he choſe ten Citizens who had Power of life and death over all the reſt. But the <hi>Perugians</hi> fearing leſt he ſhould ſet up a Tyranny upon them, they bargain'd with him to depart the City for fifty thouſand pound. He did ſo and went to <hi>Cortona,</hi> hoping to take that place by treachery; but the Plot was diſcover'd and the Conſpirators either kill'd or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, upon which he march'd to <hi>Citta di Caſtello.</hi> The <hi>Florentines</hi> alſo moved to <hi>Aughiera,</hi> a Town in their Dominions, to help their Countrymen, if <hi>Picenninus</hi> ſhould offer 'em any violence. Theſe things paſs'd in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> whilſt <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> conquer'd <hi>Philip</hi>'s Navy at the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:50681:202"/>
                  <hi>Lago di Garda</hi> (of which <hi>Italiano Furlano</hi> was Admiral) and not onely raiſed the Siege from before <hi>Breſcia</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi> but the ſame Summer vanquiſh'd <hi>Philip</hi>'s Army at <hi>Soncino</hi> having taken one thouſand five hundred Horſe, and in a ſhort time took and ſubdu'd all the Caſtles of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> part of <hi>Cremona,</hi> and <hi>Mantoua,</hi> with all <hi>Gerradadua,</hi> and made them tributary to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> At that time the Prince of <hi>Mantoua</hi> loſt <hi>Aſola, Lonato,</hi> and <hi>Peſcheria,</hi> three Towns of a good bigneſs without oppoſition: for when <hi>Picenninus</hi> was abſent, he never durſt engage with an Enemy in the open Field. But <hi>Picenninus</hi> hearing how the ſtate of Affairs was alter'd in <hi>Venice,</hi> and being ſent for by many Meſſengers and Letters as well from <hi>Philip,</hi> as the Prince of <hi>Mantoua</hi>; as alſo being tired out with the importunities of the Soldiers who were moſt of 'em Natives of that part of <hi>Italy</hi> which is near the <hi>Alps,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his Camp from <hi>Cita di Caſtello</hi> to <hi>Borgo di Sancto Sepolcro,</hi> a Town in his Territories, which lies over againſt <hi>Angliera:</hi> with deſign either by compulſion or ſtratagem, to fight the <hi>Florentines</hi> and the Pope's Army, that lay (as I told you) near <hi>Angliera.</hi> On the 29 of <hi>June</hi> (S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s day) <hi>Picenninus</hi> ſet his Army in Array, which took up a Plain of four thouſand paces, but was unfortunately forc'd to chooſe a diſadvantageous place to fight in, (becauſe he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the common Soldiers of the Enemy were gone a foraging, and was not willing to loſe the opportunity) For he was to go up the ſide of an Hill, and ſo his Enemies upon the higher ground eaſily kept him off. Yet they fought five hours very ſmartly, till at laſt <hi>Picenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> what with the multitude of his Enemies and the folly of his Son <hi>Francis,</hi> who had forſaken his Poſt, was overcome, and retreated to <hi>Borgo</hi> with great damage and the loſs of his Enſigns. And the next day leaving <hi>Borgo</hi> in the hands of the Townſmen and ſome few of his Soldiers that ſurvived the Battel, he went back through <hi>Romagna</hi> to <hi>Philip.</hi> The Townſmen of <hi>Borgo</hi> fearing they might be hardly dealt withal, becauſe they had revolted from the Pope, employ'd Agents to get their Pardon, and ſurrender'd themſelves to the Legat without loſs of limbs or goods. That Victory was very welcom both to <hi>Eugenius</hi> and the <hi>Florentines</hi>; and they ſay <hi>Aloniſius Patavinus</hi> was made a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal for that reaſon. The ſame Summer the <hi>Florentines</hi> beat Count <hi>Poppio</hi> who was <hi>Picenninus</hi>'s Ally, out of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> But <hi>Philip</hi> who was environ'd with ſo many Enemies, fought out for forein Aid, and entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who had got poſſeſſion of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> to ſtorm all the Towns which the <hi>Sfortians</hi> had in that Kingdom; to draw <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> from the <hi>Venetians. Alphonſo</hi> comply'd with his requeſt, but never could recal <hi>Francis</hi> from the War that he was engaged in. For he, when a ſufficient quantity of forage came in, march'd from <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcheria</hi> to <hi>Breſcia</hi> with fifteen thouſand Horſe, and ſix thouſand Foot, and met <hi>Picenninus</hi> at <hi>Cignano,</hi> with a deſign to fight him. <hi>Picenninus</hi> was as willing to fight as he, and though he had a leſs number of Men, yet they were ſtout Fellows and he rely'd upon their Valour. They fought briskly for ſome time, and parted upon equal terms. <hi>Francis</hi> thinking he had gotten honour enough in the Wars, for that he had challenged his Enemy into the Field, lead his Army round the Country and retook ſeveral Towns which <hi>Picenninus</hi> had taken that Winter, and made them ſubject to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> From thence he went to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinengo,</hi>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:50681:203"/>
which <hi>Picenninus</hi> had fortified with a ſtrong Garriſon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged it. But when <hi>Picenninus</hi> had augmented his Army by the arrival of <hi>Francis</hi> his Son, and the Prince of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> he went thither and pitch'd his Camp a mile off the Enemy, provoking him by Skirmiſhes to come and decide the matter in a ſet Battel: but he not now deſiring to fight the Enemy in the Field, grew wholly intent upon taking the Town. <hi>Picenninus</hi> therefore removed his Camp every day ſo much nearer the Enemy, and put <hi>Francis</hi> in ſuch dangerous circumſtances, that neither his Soldiers could forrage, nor any Proviſions be ſent in, nor the Army march out from the place, without apparent danger: and juſt then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all hopes there was a Peace declared, which had been in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> by the mediation of one <hi>Euſebiolus</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Chain,</hi> without <hi>Picenninus</hi>'s knowledg. When <hi>Picenninus</hi> heard of it, he exclaim'd at Heaven and Earth, and <hi>Philip</hi>'s inconſtancy, who with a certain Victory before him deſired Peace like a conquer'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Armies departing, the Peace was declared at <hi>Capriana,</hi> in the year 1442, upon theſe terms; That <hi>Francis</hi> ſhould marry <hi>Blanch</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Philip,</hi> and have with her, as a Dowry, <hi>Pontremoli</hi> and <hi>Cremona</hi> with all the Country belonging to it, except <hi>Picigitono</hi> and the Caſtles which the <hi>Mantouan,</hi> and <hi>Pallavicini</hi> poſſeſs'd: and that all thoſe places that <hi>Philip,</hi> and his Allies had taken, as alſo the <hi>Venetians</hi> and their Confederates (except <hi>Aſola, Lonato,</hi> and <hi>Peſcheria</hi> which were the Prince of <hi>Mantoua</hi>'s before that War) ſhould be reſtored: and he that would not accept of theſe Articles, ſhould be look'd upon as a common Enemy. <hi>Eugeneus</hi> lik'd not this Peace; becauſe <hi>Francis</hi> had neglected him whilſt he talk'd of reſtoring what was loſt, without mentioning <hi>Bologna,</hi> which <hi>Picenninus</hi> had poſſeſſion of; wherefore he reſolv'd to go from <hi>Florence</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there adviſe concerning the recovery of the Church Patrimony, becauſe that was a place where he might take more freedom. But that he might find all things quiet, he ſent <hi>Alouiſius Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavinus,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Laurence</hi> before, to put out the Seculars and reſtore the Canons regular to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> who had been expelled by the Secular Prieſts, upon a Controverſie that was between 'em, who ſhould carry the Body of Chriſt upon <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day in Proceſſion. <hi>Gino Albaneſe</hi> an excellent Soldier was put to death becauſe he would have broken the Peace between <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo. Palus Lamolara</hi> alſo a ſtout Man, of whoſe parts he was jealous, was alſo put to death. And when things were ſetled in this manner, <hi>Eugenius</hi> came to <hi>Rome September</hi> 28. 1443. (though the <hi>Florentines</hi> did all they could to keep him there) being met by all the City with all the veneration ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and lay that night at the <hi>Porta del popolo.</hi> And the next Day as he was going to S. <hi>Peters</hi> to Prayers, as the cuſtom is, he walk'd in his Pontifical Robes through the City, and heard the People were in a mutiny for that the Taxes were doubled, and a new Impoſt laid upon Wine. Thereupon he commanded ſilence, and in the preſence of 'em all, aboliſh'd that Exaction as tyrannical: at which they immediately cry'd out, Long live <hi>Eugenius</hi>; whereas before they had cry'd, <hi>Down with theſe new Gabells, the inventors of them.</hi> After nineteen Days he went to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and declared he would hold a General Council there, and ſent Letters and Meſſengers to acquaint the ſeveral Princes with his Deſign. For he had a mind to weaken and deſtroy the Council
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:50681:203"/>
of <hi>Baſil</hi> by this means. When things were thus compoſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> he remember'd the injuries he had receiv'd, and ſent <hi>Picenninus</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral againſt the <hi>Anconeſes</hi> (whom <hi>Francis</hi> had ſubdu'd) who going from <hi>Bologna</hi> toward <hi>Perugia</hi> made thoſe of <hi>Tiferno</hi> who were Allies of the <hi>Floretines,</hi> revolt, to gratifie <hi>Eugenius</hi> who was angry with the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> for ſupplying <hi>Francis</hi> with Mony to oppoſe him and keep <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona. Alphonſo</hi> too, who the year before had long beſieged <hi>Naples</hi> and at laſt through a Common-ſhore got into the Town and taken it, beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out <hi>René</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> was ſo far taken with the ſame and courage of <hi>Picenninus</hi> that he not onely choſe him General of his Army, but, to honour him the more, adopted him into the Family of <hi>Aragon:</hi> who as ſoon as he had receiv'd Money of <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> to defray the War, went into <hi>Ancona,</hi> and reduced many Towns to the Church, which <hi>Francis Sfortia,</hi> who was come thither with a good Army from <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi> vainly ſtrove to defend. About that time <hi>John Francis Gonzaga</hi> dy'd, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> who were concern'd for the time to come, made <hi>Lewis Gonzaga,</hi> Son and Heir to <hi>John Francis,</hi> their Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiary, that he, if occaſion were, might oppoſe <hi>Philip.</hi> In the mean time things were pretty quiet in thoſe parts of <hi>Italy</hi> that lie next the <hi>Alps,</hi> when <hi>Hannibal Bentivoglio,</hi> who was kept Priſoner ſometime in the Caſtle of <hi>Pelegrini,</hi> by command from <hi>Picenninus,</hi> for ſuſpicion of a Conſpiracy, eſcaped and went back to <hi>Bologna</hi> where he excited the People to liberty and ſeiz'd <hi>Francis Picenninus,</hi> Governour of the City, and all his Men. Which done, he recall'd all the Exiles whether of his own or the contrary Faction, eſpecially one <hi>Baptiſta Canedolus</hi> by name. After which the <hi>Bolognians</hi> ſent Embaſſadours to the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> to deſire their Alliance. Which the Embaſſadours ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtein'd they returned home, and preſently took the Caſtle (which was yet in the Enemies hands) by the help of thoſe recruits that were ſent 'em from their Friends, and as ſoon as they had taken deſtroy'd it, chaſing <hi>Alouiſius Vermes</hi> out of <hi>Bologna.</hi> Then <hi>Philip</hi> taking it ill that the <hi>Bolognians</hi> ſhould be in League with the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines,</hi> hired ſome Friends of <hi>Baptiſta,</hi> promiſing them aſſiſtance, to take <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> off, that themſelves and their Faction might be ſole Governours in the City. And <hi>Canedolus</hi> who was ready at Roguery, prevailed with a certain Man of <hi>Bologna</hi> (who had a Son accidentally then newly born) to chooſe <hi>Hannibal</hi> Godfather: and the next Day the Child was carried to be Chriſten'd; which being over, the Father of the Child invited <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> to S. <hi>John</hi>'s Church, becauſe it was S. <hi>John</hi>'s Day. <hi>Hannibal</hi> comply'd with the Traitor in that too, not thinking of any Deſign; but in the way thither he was ſet upon by a company of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that got about him, and was ſlain, though two Servants that he had, who loved him, did what they could to defend him. But the people of <hi>Bologna,</hi> when they knew it were ſo concern'd for the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that they preſently took up Arms and kill'd all the chief of the <hi>Canedolian</hi> Faction, particularly <hi>Baptiſta,</hi> whoſe body they dragg'd through the City and buried it very ignominiouſly. At the ſame time alſo there happen'd a great piece of villany to be acted at <hi>Rome:</hi> for <hi>Angellottus</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Marks</hi> was deprived of his life and all the Money that he had ſo covetouſly gathered and ſcraped together, by his <hi>own Valet de Chamber.</hi> The Villain was taken and tortur'd to Death,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:50681:204"/>
and then being cut into four parts was hang'd upon the four Gates of the City. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> fearing, leſt <hi>Bologna,</hi> which was very commodiouſly ſeated for both of 'em in time of War, ſhould fall into <hi>Philip</hi>'s hands, ſent immediately ſome Troops thither to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them. The <hi>Venetians</hi> were not out in their gueſs; for <hi>Philip</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſend <hi>Picenninus</hi> thither with an Army, at the requeſt of the Exiles, if he had not dy'd before he could ſet out. They ſay he dy'd for grief, that his Son <hi>Francis,</hi> whom he had left behind him in <hi>Ancona,</hi> when Cardinal <hi>Firmanus</hi> was Legat, was vanquiſh'd by <hi>Francis Sfortia.</hi> But the year after <hi>Philip</hi> took courage and adviſed <hi>Eugenius</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the recovery of <hi>Bologna,</hi> promiſing to ſupply him with Men, and bear his ſhare in the charge of the War. By which the Pope was ſo wrought upon, that he made a League with <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and ſent <hi>Sigiſmund Malateſta</hi> with a great body of Horſe into <hi>Ancona</hi> againſt <hi>Francis</hi>; that when the <hi>Florentines</hi> were otherwiſe imploy'd, <hi>Bologna</hi> might be forced to ſurrender. Now <hi>Philip</hi> had ſent <hi>William Montferrat</hi> and <hi>Charles Gonzaga</hi> before with a great Army; who entering the Territory of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna</hi> in an Hoſtile manner plunder'd all before 'em. But the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> who were concern'd for the danger of their Allies, diſpatch'd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorgius Faventinus</hi> with one thouſand five hundred Horſe and two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot, to aid the <hi>Bolognians</hi> till farther order from them and the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Things ſtood thus in <hi>Romagna</hi>; when <hi>Philip,</hi> on the ſudden, ſent for <hi>Francis Picenninus</hi> from <hi>Ancona,</hi> and gave him order to go with a great Army upon <hi>May</hi> Day, againſt the <hi>Cremoneſes</hi> who apprehended no ſuch thing. He went as he was commanded, and took a great many of the Country Fellows, and ſtrook ſuch terrour into the Citizens by battering their Walls both Night and Day, that he had very near taken the City. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> were troubled at the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which <hi>Francis</hi> and their Friends were in, and reſolv'd to defend <hi>Cremona</hi> and <hi>Bologna</hi> at the ſame time, and ſent <hi>Tibertus Brandolinus</hi> a very active Commander, who taking along with him the <hi>Bologneſes,</hi> and the Auxiliaries from <hi>Florence</hi> march'd toward the Enemy (who did not well agree among themſelves, and were encamp'd at a Town call'd St. <hi>John</hi>'s) and when he had brought <hi>William Monferrat</hi> over to the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lognians</hi> by Promiſes and Preſents, and eaſily routed <hi>Charles,</hi> he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retrieved all the Towns which the Enemy had in their hands. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna</hi> being thus quieted, and the Auxiliaries of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> divided, by order, into two parts, the one half were ſent to avoid <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> whom <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had beaten as far as the Walls of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and the other half to the <hi>Cremoneſes</hi> who were hard put to it by <hi>Francis Picenninus.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> reſolving upon an open rupture with <hi>Philip,</hi> ſent Embaſſadours to him, to denounce War unleſs he would deſiſt from the Siege of <hi>Cremona.</hi> But they were anſwer'd by a Meſſenger (for they could not ſpeak with <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf) that they might be ſafer any where, than at <hi>Millain.</hi> At which the <hi>Venetians</hi> were very angry and commanded <hi>Michelot Cotignola</hi> their General, who was then at <hi>Breſcia,</hi> to march forthwith into <hi>Cremona,</hi> (which <hi>Philip</hi> had got moſt part of,) and engage the Enemy wherever he met them. He readily obey'd their Commands, and paſſing the River <hi>Oglio</hi> at <hi>Caſale</hi> with all expedition, found the Enemy encamped upon the <hi>Po</hi> in an Iſland, which having forded, he attack'd them in their Camp, and ſoon rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:50681:204"/>
them, taking a great part of their Cavalry. After that he recover'd all the Towns, and freed <hi>Cremona</hi> from the Siege, and having augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Army by <hi>Lewis Gonzaga</hi>'s additional Forces (who had reduced <hi>Platina,</hi> and ſome Caſtles in <hi>Cremona</hi> to the <hi>Venetians</hi>) they march'd toward <hi>Geradada,</hi> and left nothing for <hi>Philip</hi> but <hi>Crema.</hi> Then croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the River they entred <hi>Millain,</hi> filling all places with fire and rapine. And when they had taken <hi>Monte di Briauſa</hi> and <hi>Brevio,</hi> where there is a Bridg over the <hi>Adda,</hi> they attaqued <hi>Leco</hi> which thoſe within ſtoutly defended, and batter'd their Ships ſo ſeverely that whole Men might have got in at the ſides of 'em; ſo that having loſt many Men, and being in great want of Forage, they were fain to depart without accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Deſign, for fear of <hi>Francis Sfortia,</hi> who they heard was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately gone over to <hi>Philip</hi>'s Party. Mean time <hi>Aloiſius Patavinus</hi> the Pope's Legat, General of the Forces which went againſt <hi>Francis Sfortia,</hi> into <hi>Ancona,</hi> hearing that <hi>Italiano</hi> and <hi>James Gatuano</hi> (who had fought partly under <hi>Philip</hi> and partly under <hi>Eugenius</hi>) were revolting to <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> he commanded them to be taken before they could arrive there, and put to Death: for both of 'em had one thouſand five hundred Horſe under them. <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> was much concern'd at that, and finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not able to ſuſtein the ſhock of his Enemies any longer, being ſet upon by ſo many at a time, and aſſiſted by no body, by the perſuaſions of <hi>Eugenius</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> who envied the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſucceſs, he left <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cona,</hi> and went into <hi>Philip</hi>'s Army, over which he was made General. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> now, leſt he ſhould ſeem to mind nothing but War, made <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas Tolentinas</hi> of the Order of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who was famous for Miracles, a Saint, and went perſonally in Proceſſion from S. <hi>Peter</hi> to S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s attended by all the Clergy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Roman</hi> People and the Cardinals. After that he expelled the Canons Secular from the <hi>Lateran</hi> and admitted onely the Regulars. He alſo built the <hi>Portico,</hi> that goes from that Church to the <hi>Sancta Sanctorum,</hi> and repaired the Cloiſter for the Prieſts to live in. He alſo augmented the painting of the Church which <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> had formerly begun; and carried the Mitre of S. <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> which was brought to <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Avignion,</hi> in his own hands from the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> to the <hi>Lateran</hi> with great veneration of all the Prieſts and People of <hi>Rome.</hi> Afterward King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> came to <hi>Tivoli</hi> and would have treated with <hi>Eugenius</hi> about the management of the War, but he heard he was ſick and ſo-ſtay'd for ſome time there. <hi>Eugenius</hi> had a great mind to have plagu'd the <hi>Florentines</hi> for helping his Enemies: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not but, if he attaqued them with his own, the King's, and <hi>Philip</hi>'s Forces all together, he might bring that City to what he pleaſed. But all his Deſigns were fruſtrated by his Death; for he dy'd in the ſixteenth year of his Pontificate, <hi>February</hi> 23. 1446. He was a Man of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy; at the beginning of his Reign, he was led away by ill Counſels and diſturb'd all things, to that degree, that he incited the <hi>Roman</hi> People to War, and gave Authority to the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> (which was the original of much miſchief) by approving of their Decrees in Letters Apoſtolical. But in proceſs of time when he came to himſelf, he acted very prudently and with good reſolution. He had a very venerable aſpect; but was rather grave than eloquent in his Speech; an indifferent Scholar, though a knowing Man, eſpecially in Hiſtory. He was bountiful to all, more eſpecially Learned Men, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:50681:205"/>
he loved; For he admitted <hi>Leonard Aretinus, Charles Poggius, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſpa Trapezuntius,</hi> and <hi>Blondus,</hi> very learned Men, to be his Secretaries. He was not eaſily provoked to anger for injuries done him, or by the Calumnies, jibes or ſcoffs of any. He was a great Patron of all Schools eſpecially that at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he had all kind of Learning taught. He loved the Religious wonderfully and gave 'em many Priviledges, beſides Revenues which he added to their foundations. But he loved War ſo much (which a Man would admire in a Pope) that beſides what I have told you of his Actions in <hi>Italy,</hi> he inſtigated the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> Son to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King (having firſt made Peace between that King and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>) to go with a great body of Horſe againſt thoſe of <hi>Baſil.</hi> He did ſo, and routed the Aſſembly. And afterward he ſent <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> along with <hi>Julian Caeſarinus</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks:</hi> of whom thirty thouſand were ſlain in one Battel between <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and the <hi>Danube,</hi> though the King indeed himſelf and the Cardinal too, was kill'd at the ſame time. He was accounted very ſtrict to his word, unleſs when he had promiſed a thing which it was better revoke than perform. He kept a very good Houſe, and yet lived on a ſpare Diet himſelf, and was ſo great a ſtranger to Wine, that he was properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Abſtemious. He had but very few familiar Friends, but they were all learned Men, whoſe Counſel he made uſe of in great matters; and uſed to admit into his Chamber at Supper-time, to be as witneſſes of his ſober Converſation. And then he would ask 'em, what news in the City, what People thought of his Government ſince he had been Pope, that he might correct any Errour, if ought were amiſs either in his own Perſon or any body elſe. He endeavoured to adorn the Church with Buildings and Chappels as appears by the Pope's Chappel and the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Door of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church. But he dy'd, (as I told you) after he had done many great Actions, in the ſixty fourth year of his age, and was buried in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, under a Marble Tomb, upon which there are theſe Verſes;

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>ICOLAS</hi> the Fifth, formerly called <hi>Thomas Sarzana,</hi> a Town in the Territory of <hi>Lucca,</hi> was choſen Pope by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſent, <hi>March</hi> 6. 1447. Who though he were a Man but of mean extract (his Mothers name was <hi>Andreola,</hi> and his Father's <hi>Bartholomew</hi> a Phyſician) yet he was worthy of the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate for his Virtue, Learning, Courteſie, good Nature, Liberality and Magnificence; notwithſtanding all which he was ſo modeſt, that he thought himſelf undeſerving of ſo great an Honour, and deſired the Cardinals to take better care for the Church of God. But when the Cardinal of <hi>Tarento</hi> exhorted him not to reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his ſhoulders to the burthen, and took it upon him. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Portugal</hi> being ask'd (as 'tis uſual) coming out of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,</hi> Who they had made Pope? He anſwer'd, We did not chooſe <hi>Nicolas,</hi> but God has. There are who ſay, that this <hi>Thomas</hi> was born at <hi>Piſa,</hi> brought up at <hi>Lucca,</hi> and made a Scholar at <hi>Bologna,</hi> eſpecially in Philoſophy and Divinity which he learn'd under <hi>Nicolas Albergate,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Croſs,</hi> who was extreamly pleaſed with the Youths in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, and parts. For which reaſon he, in his Popedom, aſſumed the name of <hi>Nicolas,</hi> becauſe it was the name of one who had deſerv'd very well of him. Having gain'd his Degree in the Univerſity, by a probation in the moſt acute Controverſies, the Cardinal of S. <hi>Croſs</hi> made him Steward of his Houſhold, and of the Clerks of the Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary, till he got a Pontifical Sub-Deaconſhip by his good Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which all People admired, and then he began to think of greater matters. For <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who knew his Learning and integrity (eſpecially by the Diſputations that he had with the <hi>Greeks</hi> at <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi>) had at that time deſign'd him for a Cardinal. But that he might do it with better pretenſions, he ſent him into <hi>Germany</hi> along with <hi>John Carvagialla</hi> (who was afterward Cardinal of S. <hi>Angelo</hi>) to diſſolve the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and the neutrality. For the <hi>Germans</hi> were called <hi>Neuters,</hi> becauſe they would obey neither <hi>Felix</hi> nor <hi>Eugenius</hi>; by which means the Church of God ſuffer'd greatly, and the Papacy loſt ſomething of its grandieur. There were frequent meetings to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute that Point before <hi>Frederick</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by the perſuaſions of <hi>Aeneas Picolhomineus,</hi> who was afterward Pope; but at that time only Secretary to the King. And indeed they found it hard to remove the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> from their Opinion, though it was altogether falſe: as on the other ſide it was difficult to induce <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Agents to comply with the <hi>German</hi> Propoſals. At laſt the Agents being mollified, and the requeſts of the <hi>Germans</hi> moderated, they had certainly put an end to the Schiſm and Neutrality (which was ſo pernicious to the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi>) if the <hi>Germans</hi> would have ſtood to their Promiſe. So that the Legats went back to <hi>Eugenius</hi> with that Opinion and were made Cardinals by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral agreement; to whom <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſent their Hats whilſt they were yet at the <hi>Porta del popolo,</hi> that they might come with greater honour
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:50681:206"/>
into the City. Thus in one and the ſame year <hi>Thomas</hi> got to be Biſhop of <hi>Bologna,</hi> Cardinal and Pope, to the great ſatisfaction of the Clergy and People of <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet when the Cardinals were in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> there was a ſmall buſtle in the City by the inſtigation of <hi>Stephen Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caro</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, and an eloquent, ingenious Man, who calling his Companions about him into the Church, called <hi>Ara Coeli,</hi> encouraged 'em to aſſert their Liberty: for he ſaid that every petit Town (when the Lord of it was dead) was us'd to talk of Liberty, or at leaſt, of limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Power of their Governours. But nothing was done to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Benevento</hi> then Vice-Chamberlain, was againſt it. The <hi>Romans</hi> alſo feared King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who ſtay'd at <hi>Tivoli</hi> after <hi>Eugenius</hi> was dead, and was in doubt with himſelf, whether he ſhould go back, or make War againſt the <hi>Florentines,</hi> as he, <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> had formerly a deſign to do. And whilſt he delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, two <hi>Sieneſes,</hi> that got their livings by ſetting People together by the ears, perſuaded him to attempt the Government of <hi>Tuſcany:</hi> which he might eaſily obtain, if he were once Maſter of <hi>Siena,</hi> which would ſurrender it ſelf upon his arrival there. The King commended the <hi>Sieneſes,</hi> and ſending them away to ſolicite their Fellow-Citizens, he promiſed them to be there in ſuch a time. But <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Pope, who was a lover of peace and quietneſs, after he had kept his Coronation (as the faſhion is) and made many Proceſſions on foot in his own Perſon, he ſent Cardinal <hi>Morinenſis</hi> to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> (a place which being neutral was fit for the Treaty) that by the perſuaſion and Authority of his Legat, the Factions might be the more induced to a compoſure. Thither alſo did <hi>Alphonſa, Philip,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> ſend their Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, who after a long Debate gave <hi>Philip</hi> leave to chooſe, whether he would make a Truce with the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> for five years (both ſides keeping what they had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) or conclude a Peace, and change <hi>Crema</hi> for thoſe Towns which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had taken upon the River <hi>Adda</hi>; leaving onely <hi>Caſſan</hi> at the Pope's diſpoſal, as being his due by compact, to make amends for the injuries which he firſt received. But that alſo was afterward thrown in, to make the Peace more laſting. And one of <hi>Philip</hi>'s Embaſſadours was ſent to make the Propoſal to him; who found him dead of an Apoplexy the day before he came to <hi>Millain, Auguſt</hi> 8. 1447. <hi>Morinenſis,</hi> hearing of <hi>Philip</hi>'s death, ſent for all the Embaſſadours in haſte to his Houſe, and urg'd for Peace as earneſtly as ever. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> when they were ask'd if they would continue of their former Opinion, made anſwer, That they could not tell what they might do now <hi>Philip</hi> was dead, but that they would write to the Senate concerning that Affair, and do as they ſhould order them. In the mean time the other Embaſſadours that were there, knowing the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> ambition to govern all <hi>Italy,</hi> diſſolv'd the Aſſembly and went every one to their own Home, the Pope's Legat exhorting them to Concord, but all in vain. But the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whoſe Camp was at <hi>Sorefina</hi> near <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi> in hopes to take that tumultuous City by ſurrender with the help of the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> when they heard of <hi>Philip</hi>'s death march'd preſently to <hi>Lody</hi>; which having taken, they receiv'd thoſe of <hi>Piacenza</hi> into their Alliance upon the ſame terms as them of <hi>Lodi</hi>; and ſent one thouſand five hundred Horſe thither immediately to aſſiſt the people of <hi>Piacenza</hi> if any body ſhould moleſt 'em. <hi>Francis Sfortia,</hi> who at that time was
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:50681:206"/>
beaten out of <hi>Ancona</hi> and quartered in <hi>Bologna,</hi> to refreſh his Army, whoſe Arms, Horſes, and Men were almoſt ſpent with this long War, when he heard that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſeiz'd all upon his Father-in-law's death, went great days Journeys till he came to <hi>Cremona,</hi> and was choſen General by the univerſal conſent of the <hi>Millaineſes</hi> over all their Forces againſt the <hi>Venetians.</hi> And having made a Bridg over the River <hi>Po,</hi> which he fortified with Caſtles and Artillery, to hinder the <hi>Venetians</hi> from coming with a Navy to <hi>Piacenza,</hi> he paſſed the <hi>Adda</hi> at <hi>Picigitono,</hi> and encamp'd not far from the Enemy who lay at <hi>Camurago.</hi> And there they had ſome light Skirmiſhes to try, I ſuppoſe, the Enemies courage. The People of <hi>Pavia</hi> were ſo much encouraged at <hi>Francis</hi>'s coming, and ſo glad to ſee him, becauſe they hated to be ſubject to the <hi>Millaineſes</hi> upon an old grudg that was between them, and on the other hand, would rather ſuffer any thing than ſubmit to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who had formerly deſpiſed their Alliance, inſomuch that they deliver'd their City up to <hi>Francis</hi> without any more ado by conſent of the Governour of the Caſtle: which was ſuch an Addition to his grandieur that <hi>Sfortia</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently affected to be Lord of the whole Dutchy of <hi>Millain.</hi> Theſe things paſſed in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and thereabouts, whilſt <hi>Alphonſo</hi> at the ſame time fell down with his Army into the Sea-coaſt of <hi>Siena,</hi> and had ſubdued them (though the Pope was againſt it) had not the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who knew the King's intention, ſent a Meſſenger to <hi>Siena,</hi> to adviſe them, that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> who was covetous of Dominion, was no leſs their Enemy than the <hi>Florentines.</hi> The <hi>Sieneſes</hi> hearing what danger they were in, they did not deny the King any kind of proviſions, but yet they would not ſuffer any of his Soldiers to come within their Walls. So that the King when he obſerv'd their caution, march'd down into <hi>Volaterra,</hi> and <hi>Piſa,</hi> and took many Caſtles there partly by ſurrender and partly by ſtorm: which yet the <hi>Florentines</hi> recover'd not long after, all but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiglione,</hi> under the command of <hi>Sigiſmund Malateſta,</hi> whom they had corrupted to come over from <hi>Alphonſo</hi> to their ſide. In the mean time <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas</hi> the Pope continually perſuaded the King and the <hi>Venetians</hi> to Peace rather than War; but they, who were grown proud and unruly would not hearken to his good Advice. Thereupon <hi>Francis</hi> raiſed a great Army, out of the main ſtrength of <hi>Italy,</hi> (uniting the <hi>Brachian</hi> and <hi>Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Soldiers) and pitch'd his Camp in the middle of <hi>Autumn</hi> at <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza,</hi> in which was a good Garriſon of <hi>Venetians,</hi> and beating down part of the Walls with Cannon he ſtay'd before it ſo long till the <hi>Po</hi> roſe to that prodigious heighth that his <hi>Galeoones</hi> came up to the very Walls, and ſo attacking it both by Land and Water, at laſt he took and plunder'd it. This was a great Honour to <hi>Francis,</hi> to take ſo great a City and that in the Winter-time, when it rained ſo hard, that the Soldiers were ready to leave their Tents. Yet <hi>Nicolas</hi> was even then ſtill talking of Peace, and the <hi>Florentines</hi> were urgent with their Allies the <hi>Venetians,</hi> becauſe they fear'd the King's Power, who was then with his Army in <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> But nothing was done in it, becauſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> were unwilling to reſtore <hi>Lodi</hi> to the <hi>Millaineſes</hi> which they earneſtly ſought. So that <hi>Nicolas</hi> after ſo many attempts to no purpoſe, laid aſide all thoughts of making Peace by ſuch means, and applying himſelf to religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, he order'd Days of Humiliation to be kept for appeaſing God's anger, and Prayers for the Peace of Chriſtendom. And at the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:50681:207"/>
the Pope himſelf aſſiſted with all the Clergy in Proceſſion from S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s to S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s, with great Piety and Religion. But the wrath of God was not abated for all that, ſo much had Men probably deſerved it. For two years after there was ſuch a Plague in almoſt all places, that few ſurvived out of great numbers. And this Calamity was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by frequent Earthquakes, and an Eclipſe of the Sun: nay it had been often foretold by the Friers Predicants; eſpecially, one <hi>Robert</hi> a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> and famous Preacher, who ſo moved the people of <hi>Rome</hi> with his Sermons that the Women and Children ran about the City de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring God to be merciful unto them. And leaſt any misfortune ſhould be lacking in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Wars which we told you were begun before did ſo increaſe, that one would have thought it impoſſible to have put an end to them. For <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> (the next Summer) having taken ſome Caſtles from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> went with his Land and Sea-forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Navy which block'd up the <hi>Cremoneſes,</hi> and forced it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to <hi>Caſal:</hi> thither alſo he follow'd it, and with his Cannon diſabled all their Ships as they lay in the Harbour, driving the Admiral of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> to ſuch deſpair that he burn'd his Navy, which he could not keep, and ran into the Town as faſt as he could. <hi>Francis</hi> then went from thence, and took no farther care about <hi>Cremona,</hi> having deſtroy'd the Enemies Navy; but march'd toward <hi>Geradada,</hi> and encamp'd before <hi>Caravagio</hi> which was well fortified by the Enemies. The <hi>Venetians</hi> moved thither too, fearing they ſhould loſe their reputation, if the <hi>Millaineſes</hi> took the Town, and therefore they lay about a mile off the Enemy, and ſhew'd the Townſmen that if occaſion were they would come in and aſſiſt them. They had Skirmiſhes every day, they were ſo near one another: but when they came to joyn Battel, it happen'd to be in a narrow way ſurrounded with Fens, where the Vanguard of the <hi>Venetians</hi> was ſo ſtraighten'd, that they could not give back (as ſometimes in War, it may be convenient to do) nor yet fight, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my came ſo thick upon them, inſomuch that they muſt of neceſſity have periſh'd, if the Reer had not begun to run away. <hi>Francis</hi> purſu'd 'em as they gave ground, and not onely made himſelf Maſter of their wealthy Camp but took about five thouſand Horſe and Foot. After that the <hi>Brachians</hi> were, without <hi>Francis</hi> his conſent, ordered by the <hi>Millaineſes</hi> to attaque <hi>Lodi,</hi> and he moved toward <hi>Breſcia</hi> with his Army and beſieged it. Which ſo alarm'd the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded themſelves loſt, if they did not make Peace with <hi>Francis,</hi> now he had a quarrel with the <hi>Millaineſes</hi>; and a Peace they did make upon condition, That joyning their Forces againſt the <hi>Millaineſes,</hi> all that they ſhould take beyond the River <hi>Adda</hi> and <hi>Po</hi> ſhould be <hi>Francis</hi>'s, and that on this ſide the <hi>Adda,</hi> ſhould be the <hi>Venetians:</hi> that they ſhould allow him (the <hi>Florentines</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> betwixt 'em) ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand pounds a month, and ſend him in aid ſtill, till he got poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Millain.</hi> Having made this League and drawn what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders he could to his ſide by Promiſes and Preſents, he turn'd toward the <hi>Millaineſes,</hi> and took moſt of their Cities by ſurrender. At this ſucceſs of his the <hi>Venetians</hi> were ſo concern'd, when they ſaw his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune much better than they expected, that they took <hi>Crema</hi> according to agreement and recalling all their Soldiers they made Peace with the <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laineſes,</hi> as fearing the power of <hi>Francis,</hi> if he once got into <hi>Millain.</hi>
                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:50681:207"/>
But <hi>Francis</hi> pretended a kindneſs to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and being aſſiſted and ſupply'd more out of <hi>Coſmo di Medices</hi>'s private Pocket than out of the Treaſury of <hi>Florence,</hi> after a long and tedious Siege, and many bloody Skirmiſhes, in the middle of Winter, though ſome of his Men forſook him and joined with the Enemy, and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> was againſt him, who claimed <hi>Millain</hi> as his Birthright (and therefore kept <hi>Lewis Gonzaga</hi> in pay, whom he ſent againſt the <hi>Bolognians,</hi> that his Men might paſs with more ſafety into <hi>Lombardy</hi>) he at laſt took <hi>Millain</hi> in the year 1449. 'Tis true, the <hi>Venetians</hi> did aſſiſt the <hi>Millaineſes,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Sigiſmund Malateſta</hi> (who was to join with <hi>Picenninus,</hi> that fought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Millaineſes</hi>) but after ſuch a lame rate, that they were famiſh'd and yielded up the City rather to the <hi>Venetians</hi> than to <hi>Francis.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſeeing the thing went quite contrary to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they treated with <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who was an utter Enemy to <hi>Francis,</hi> and made a League with him, to rout the ambitious Man out of <hi>Millain</hi> before he grew too ſtrong. They alſo ſollicited the <hi>Florentines</hi> to do the ſame; who ſaid they would never be againſt <hi>Francis,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Venetians</hi> baniſh'd their Merchants out of their Dominions, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with <hi>Alphonſo</hi> to do the like. <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Pope, ſeeing all <hi>Italy</hi> in Arms, did often interpoſe his Authority to make a Peace, that all people might come the next year freely out of all <hi>Europe</hi> to the Jubilee; for the fiftieth year was acoming wherein the Jubilee was to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated after the uſual manner. Beſides he made ſix Cardinals, of which number were <hi>Latinus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus,</hi> and his own Brother by the Mothers ſide, called <hi>Philip,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Laurence</hi> in <hi>Lucina,</hi> a very good Man and of a generous diſpoſition. Mean time <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, at the Pope's requeſt, forced <hi>Felix</hi> to renounce the Popedom, becauſe he ſaw how pernicious and deſtructive ſo much Sedition had been to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Yet <hi>Nicolas</hi> was ſo civil and kind to <hi>Amadeus,</hi> that he ſent him a Cardinals Hat, with Legantine Power in <hi>Germany,</hi> that he might not live without ſome Honour at leaſt. And thoſe Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals alſo which <hi>Amadeus</hi> had made, ſubmitted. This agreement of theirs did ſo rejoyce not onely all the Clergy, but the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Night after they heard of it, <hi>April</hi> 23. 1449. they rode about the City with Flambeaus in their Hands, and cry'd out, Long live <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas.</hi> The Pope, that he might not ſeem unthankful to God for ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a benefit, went publickly to Prayers in the <hi>Vatican</hi> along with the Clergy and the people. The like was done all <hi>Italy</hi> over, when they ſaw the Church of God freed from ſuch a pernicious Sedition. Nay the Pope's Authority and eſteem was ſo great, that he reſtrain'd even Princes for ſome time, when they had a mind to make War. For <hi>James Picenninus, Sigiſmund Malateſta,</hi> and <hi>Charles Gonzaga,</hi> who were <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi>'s bitter, mortal Enemies, incited the <hi>Venetians</hi> to that War. The <hi>Venetians</hi> alſo had drawn the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> into their Alliance, together with the Marquis of <hi>Montferrat</hi> and the Lords of <hi>Corregio:</hi> and try'd to bring over the <hi>Bolognians</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Perugia,</hi> but in vain, for the Pope was againſt it and threaten'd 'em with his diſpleaſure if they offer'd to do it. They likewiſe indented with <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> that whilſt they attaqued <hi>Francis,</hi> he ſhould engage the <hi>Florentines.</hi> But <hi>Francis</hi> relying upon the friendſhip and power of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and having taken <hi>Lewis Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga</hi> Prince of <hi>Mantoua</hi> into his Alliance, he prepared himſelf with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:50681:208"/>
for the War. Hence aroſe great Animoſities between <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Lewis,</hi> that <hi>Lewis</hi> ſhould court his Alliance, who was <hi>Charles</hi>'s Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and becauſe he had kept ſome Towns from him which his Father left him by his Will. For <hi>Lewis</hi> was his Brother's ſecurity when he was once arreſted for eighty thouſand pounds; and <hi>Charles</hi> having no mind to part with his Land, he choſe rather to pay the Money to <hi>Francis</hi> (who was for Money or Towns either) and keep the Towns in his own hands, as being near and conveniently ſituated. For this reaſon <hi>Charles</hi> blamed his Brother and accuſed him as a Robber, not onely to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> on whoſe ſide he was, but to the Emperour, by whoſe aſſiſtance he expected to have right done him. And now the Year of Jubilee was come, when ſuch a multitude of people flock'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> as never were ſeen there before; So that, when they came from ſeeing our Saviours Picture, in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> back into the City, a Mule which was in the way, belonging to <hi>Peter Barbus,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s, was throng'd to death, and two hundred Men and three Horſes trodden to Dirt and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated in the crow'd upon the Bridg near S. <hi>Angelo.</hi> Beſides many that fell from the ſides of the Bridg into the River and periſh'd in the Water. It is certain there were one hundred thirty ſix buried upon that occaſion in S. <hi>Celſus</hi>'s; and the reſt carried to <hi>Campo Sancto.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Pope <hi>Nicolas,</hi> who was heartily ſorry for them, pull'd down cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little Cottages that ſtraighten'd the way to the Bridg and ſpent moſt of that Year in Proceſſions, daily viſiting one noted Church or other, whither he was attended by all the Cardinals. He likewiſe took care, that though there were ſuch a vaſt number of people, yet they ſhould want nothing that was neceſſary for them: nor was he wanting with Curſes and Guards to deter High-way Men from moleſting thoſe Strangers that came to the City at that time. The next year he heard that <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour was coming to the City, to receive his Imperial Crown, and to marry <hi>Leonora,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s Niece; wherefore he fortified the Gates and Towers of the City, as alſo the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo</hi> as well as he could, out of fear, I ſuppoſe, leſt the Emperour's coming ſhould make ſome new commotion there: he being naturally very timorous. For that reaſon he call'd all his Forces to <hi>Rome,</hi> and, to oblige the People, choſe thirteen Senators, to govern the thirteen Wards of the City, and gave 'em thirteen Scarlet Gowns. The Emperour upon his arrival was met by thirteen Cardinals, with all the Nobility and Magiſtracy of the City, and having paſſed the Caſtle gate was ſaluted at S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, by the Pope himſelf: by whom he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into the Church, with his Empreſs <hi>Leonora,</hi> whom he had met at <hi>Siena</hi> lately arrived out of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon <hi>March</hi> 9. 1452. And from thence (after Maſs ſaid) they departed, and lodg'd in that Houſe which ſtands by S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Stairs to this day, though it looks better than it did, becauſe it was beautified at the coſt and charge of the Cardinal of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> For ſome days after the Pope ſaid Maſs in his own Perſon, and bleſſed the Emperour and Empreſs after the uſual manner at Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, before the Bridegroom lies with his Bride: and preſented them with the Crown Imperial upon the eighteenth of that month, in the ſame place. As the Emperour was going, after his Coronation, to S. <hi>John</hi>'s, he made ſeveral Knights upon the Bridg at S. <hi>Angelo.</hi> Then he and his Empreſs went into <hi>Naples,</hi> to ſee King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> by whom he was
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:50681:208"/>
receiv'd with all ſplendour and magnificence; and afterward returning to <hi>Rome</hi> by Sea, he took his Journey immediately for his own Countrey, becauſe he heard that ſome Princes in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> were upon new Deſigns on the behalf of King <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> (a fine young Gentleman) whom he had brought along with him. When he departed, two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals attended upon him ſeveral miles, that is to ſay, the Cardinal of <hi>Bologna,</hi> who was the Pope's Brother and <hi>Carvagialla</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo.</hi> Now when the Emperour was gone, the <hi>Venetians</hi> raiſed a great Army and march'd into <hi>Cremona,</hi> where they ſpoil'd all they came near, beſieging <hi>Soncio</hi> and the adjacent Towns, which they not long after took, together with ſome Troops of Horſe, that fell into their hands, becauſe <hi>Francis</hi> had not his Men ready ſo ſoon as he ſhould have had. But after that when <hi>Lewis Gonzaga</hi> his Friend and Ally came up, he went into <hi>Breſcia</hi> and brought the <hi>Venetians</hi> to ſuch an extremity that they durſt not venture out of their Fens, to fight in the open Campaigne. For that reaſon the <hi>Venetians</hi> were willing to protract the time, as placing all their hopes of Victory in delays, becauſe they thought <hi>Francis</hi> could not hold out long, at ſuch a charge for want of Money. They likewiſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that the <hi>Millaineſes</hi> would think of their Liberty which he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extorted from them, and, whilſt <hi>Francis</hi> was engaged in ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant War, endeavour to ſhake off the yoke of ſervitude by ſome new commotions. <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> at this time by the command of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Alphonſo</hi> marched into <hi>Tuſcany</hi> with about eight thouſand Horſe, and four thouſand Foot, againſt the <hi>Florentines:</hi> and when he had tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted <hi>Cortona</hi> to rebel, he took <hi>Foiano</hi> a Town near <hi>Arezzo</hi> after forty days Siege, with the loſs of a great many Men on both ſides. He march'd from thence into <hi>Siena,</hi> and after he had vainly attempted the taking of <hi>Caſtellina,</hi> he fell down into the Sea-coaſt of <hi>Siena</hi> to Winter, but took ſome Caſtles from thoſe of <hi>Volaterra</hi> by the way. <hi>Sigiſmund Malateſta</hi> who was General of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Army obſerv'd his motions all along, with Deſign to take an opportunity of doing his buſineſs the more ſucceſsfully. But the <hi>Florentines</hi> fearing the Power of <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> both by Sea and Land, reſolv'd with the conſent of <hi>Francis,</hi> to call in forein Aid; and upon that account they ſent <hi>Angelus Accioiolus,</hi> a Knight, their Envoy into <hi>France,</hi> who, recounting the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual kindneſſes between the <hi>Florentines</hi> and that Crown, induced him to command the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the <hi>Griſons,</hi> that had taken up Arms againſt <hi>Francis,</hi> not to injure the Friend and Ally of the <hi>Florentines</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or deed, if they would have him their Friend. He alſo perſuaded <hi>Renatus</hi> to accept of his aſſiſtance by Men and Money, in order to retrieve the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> from whence he had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by <hi>Alphonſo:</hi> ſeeing the King was at that time engaged in the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> Wars. After this Embaſſy the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> grew ſo proſperous, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> were glad to make Peace, their Army which they had ſent againſt the Prince of <hi>Mantua</hi> under the command of <hi>Charles Gonzaga,</hi> being routed not far from <hi>Godio:</hi> This Army had been raiſed and diſpatch'd away under <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Mantuan</hi> and <hi>Brandoline,</hi> who were bringing together Forces for the ſervice of <hi>Sforza,</hi> from joyning with him, by which means he would have eaſily been able to overcome their leſs powerful Army under <hi>Gentilis. Carvia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galla</hi> came the year before to the Armies, to make Peace between them,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:50681:209"/>
in the name of <hi>Nicolas</hi>; but went away without any ſatisfaction, calling both God and Man to witneſs, it was not long of <hi>Nicolas</hi> that a Peace was not ſetled in <hi>Italy,</hi> but that he was deſirous it ſhould be ſo, that War might be made againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> by the unanimous conſent of Chriſtendom. For he had heard that the <hi>Turks</hi> were making prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and therefore ſent Cardinal <hi>Ruten</hi> thither, who was a <hi>Conſtantinopolitan</hi> born, to promiſe the Emperour and the Citizens his Aſſiſtance, if they would return to the Catholick Church, as they had promiſed in the Council of <hi>Florence.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi> who was deſirous to recover the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> (in order whereunto <hi>Francis</hi> and the <hi>Florentines</hi> had promiſed him their aſſiſtance, if he would paſs the <hi>Alps</hi> againſt the <hi>Venetians</hi>) attempted, but in vain, to make his way through <hi>Savoy</hi> with two thouſand Horſe, and having ſpent moſt of the Summer in that Affair, went another way to <hi>Savona,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Francis. Francis</hi> was ſo proud of the company of ſo great a King, and was ſo well recruited both as to Men and Courage, that he chaſed his Enemy into the Mountains of <hi>Breſcia.</hi> And after that march'd round <hi>Breſcia</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi> where he took forty Towns partly by ſtorm, and partly by ſurrender. But the Winter coming on, they all went into their Winter Quarters, and <hi>Renatus,</hi> leaving his Son at <hi>Florence,</hi> returned (much diſſatisfied both with the <hi>Florentines</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi>) into <hi>France.</hi> All Peoples courage began now to cool with the Seaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the States and Princes finding their Treaſuries almoſt exhauſted with the continual charges of a War, they began to think of Peace, which <hi>Nicolas</hi> had formerly attempted: and the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> who hated the licentiouſneſs of the common Soldiers, were now mightily for it. <hi>Nicolas</hi> having juſt diſcover'd the conſpiracy of <hi>Stephen Porcarius</hi> a Knight of <hi>Rome,</hi> neglected that Affair, though it were in a fair way, and apply'd himſelf to remove thoſe civil Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. For <hi>Stephen</hi> had more Courage than Power, and was a very great Maſter of his Mother-Tongue, and having made broad Signs that he would free his Country (as I told you) was baniſh'd by the Pope into <hi>Bologna,</hi> upon condition, that every day he ſhould preſent himſelf to <hi>Nicen</hi> who was Governour of the City. But he pretending himſelf ſick cheated the Governour, and by adviſe of the Conſpirators went back to <hi>Rome</hi> in all haſte, with a Deſign, as ſoon as he came thither to cry out <hi>Liberty</hi> to the People and ſeize upon the Pope and Cardinals. But whilſt he lay down a little while, tired with the length of his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and much watching (for he had been ſome whole Nights with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſleep) he gave them opportunity and time to diſcover the Plot. When the Pope knew of his audacious Deſign, he preſently ſent <hi>James Lavagnolus,</hi> a Senator, a <hi>Veroneſe</hi> and Sub-Chamberlain with a Guard to take and put him into Priſon. He hearing of their coming, fled to his Siſters Houſe, and left <hi>Baptiſta Sarra,</hi> with a few Servants at his own; who being an active, bold Fellow, got both himſelf and his Companions out of the Houſe and eſcaped without any hurt. But being inform'd whither <hi>Stephen</hi> was gone, they took him at his Siſters, where he lay hid in a Cheſt, and having confeſs'd the whole ſtory of the Plot, they hang'd him under <hi>Caſtel S. Angelo. Angelus Maſſa</hi> and his Son had the ſame puniſhment in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> together with their Accomplice, <hi>Savus,</hi> having firſt read the Narrative of the Plot publickly, <hi>January</hi> 9. 1453.
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:50681:209"/>
After that he perſecuted and deſtroy'd all the reſt of the Conſpirators, eſpecially <hi>Francis Gabadeus,</hi> and <hi>Peter de Monterotundo,</hi> with <hi>Baptiſta Sarra</hi> who was deliver'd up to Juſtice by the <hi>Venetians.</hi> For to them had he fled after the Conſpiracy was diſcover'd. But <hi>Nicolas</hi> who hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had treated the <hi>Romans</hi> with all Liberality and kindneſs, and went about the City with more freedom, than ever any Pope before him, was more cautious for the future, and more moroſe too not onely to all in general, but eſpecially to the <hi>Romans:</hi> whom he would not admit to ſpeak with him. Beſides he had the Gout very ſeverely; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tormented him ſo much as when he heard that the <hi>Turk</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Pera</hi> at one time, and that the Emperour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> with many thouſands more, was kill'd. He was afraid leſt Cardinal <hi>Ruten</hi> might have been taken and kill'd too (whom he (I told you) ſent thither) but he eſcaped in a diſguiſe. The Pope had a mind to aſſiſt the <hi>Conſtantinopolitans</hi> with Soldiers and a Navy, as his Letters which he wrote to the Emperour do teſtifie: wherein among other misfortunes he blames them for their revolting from the Church, and their pretended affection to the <hi>Latines:</hi> but that City was taken ſo ſuddenly, that he had hardly any time to think of ſending Aid. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all theſe things, leſt any thing ſhould be lacking to torment him, the Count <hi>Averſus</hi> attaqued <hi>Norſcia</hi> without his Order, being hired to do ſo by thoſe of <hi>Spoleto</hi>: for thoſe two People had a Controverſie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Bounds. Hereupon he ſent <hi>Angelus Ronco</hi> with the Church-Forces to ſtop the Count's paſſage, that he might not return to his own Towns. But he hearing that <hi>Angelus</hi> was in the fault that the Soldiers did not take the Count as he came back, he ſent for him into <hi>Caſtel S. Angelo</hi> and put him to death at three of the Clock at Night. Some write, that <hi>Nicolas</hi> was very ſorry for that Action, that the Governour of the Caſtle ſhould execute what he in paſſion commanded him, ſo punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. The <hi>Venetians</hi> now ſeeing it was to no purpoſe to talk of Peace, (for they had often attempted it) and fearing leſt <hi>Francis</hi> ſhould ſlight it by the perſuaſion of <hi>Lewis Gonzaga,</hi> they ſent <hi>James Picennine</hi> their General, with a great body of Horſe in all ſpeed to <hi>Volta:</hi> which when he had taken and repelled <hi>Angelus</hi> into <hi>Godio</hi> (not without damage to <hi>Lewis,</hi> who was then ſick there) they recalled him into his Winter-Quarters, thinking that <hi>Lewis</hi> was now ſufficiently moved to ſeek Peace. In the mean time <hi>Simonetus,</hi> an <hi>Ermit,</hi> went up and down from one to the other, and perſuaded ſometimes the <hi>Venetians</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Francis</hi> to Concord ſo long till he made 'em agree upon a Peace, which was publickly proclaimed, <hi>April</hi> 9. 1454. upon theſe terms, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one ſhould have all that was theirs before the War reſtored to 'em, except <hi>Geradada</hi> and <hi>Gaſtiglione di Peſcara,</hi> of which the former <hi>Francis</hi> had taken from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the later from the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi> And to make it the ſtronger, as alſo that <hi>Alphonſo</hi> might ſee, they had reſpect to him as a King, the Princes and States thought fit to ſend Embaſſadours to him: where when they arrived from all places, <hi>Dominicus Capranius,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Croſſes</hi> and great Penitentiary, (a Man of great Prudence and Authority) who was ſent Legat from the Pope, by his exhortations and admonitions offering himſelf the Umpire for the Peace, he brought him at laſt to agree that the Peace which the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> had made, ſhould be confirm'd, and aſſented to
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:50681:210"/>
by all Parties; and if any quarrel happen'd between them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the Pope ſhould have Power to decide it: as alſo that whoever ſhould offer violence to the other, ſhould be cenſur'd by the Pope, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd a common Enemy. When therefore they had all taken an Oath to perform it, the Peace was confirm'd at <hi>Naples,</hi> about a year after the former Peace, which was accounted the moſt firm that ever our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors knew. For all except the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> joyn'd in it; but <hi>Alphonſo</hi> could not agree with them by any means, becauſe they promiſed him Tribute and did not pay it, as he ſaid. There was alſo left a good pretence for a War either by the neglect or deſign of the Embaſſadours, which <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo</hi> made uſe of afterward againſt <hi>Sigiſmund Malateſta</hi>; that he ſhould receive Money of <hi>Alphonſo</hi> as a Soldiers pay, and yet fight under the <hi>Florentines</hi> againſt him. But <hi>Nicolas,</hi> the Pope, whether for grief at <hi>Conſtantinoples</hi> being taken, or whether of a Fever and the Gout where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal he was very much tormented, died in the eighth year of his Pontificate, 1455. and was buried in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s very honourably; upon whoſe Tombſtone this Epitaph is deſervedly inſcribed;

He was commendable for his Liberality toward all, eſpecially Learned Men, whom he advanced with Money, Court-preferments, and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; whom he would ſometimes put upon reading publick Lectures, ſometimes upon writing ſome new thing, and ſometimes upon tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Greek</hi> Authors into <hi>Latin,</hi> inſomuch that the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues which had lain hid for ſix hundred years, at laſt regain'd their ſplendour to ſome conſiderable degree. He alſo ſent thoſe Learned Men all over <hi>Europe</hi> to find out ſuch Books, as had been loſt either by the negligence of Antiquity, or the brutal fury of the barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So that <hi>Poggius</hi> found out <hi>Quintilian</hi>; and <hi>Enoch Aſculanus, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Caelius Appicius,</hi> as alſo <hi>Pomponius Porphyrio,</hi> a famous Writer upon <hi>Horace.</hi> Beſides, he erected moſt ſtately Buildings in the City, and the <hi>Vatican:</hi> in the City, a noble Houſe for Popes, near S. <hi>Marie</hi> the Greater, and repaired S. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Church that ſtands in the <hi>Mount di S. Giovanni,</hi> but built S. <hi>Theodores,</hi> that ſtands upon the Plain between the <hi>Palazzo Maggiore</hi> and the <hi>Campidoglio,</hi> from the ground. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe covered the roof of S. <hi>Mary the Round</hi> which ſtands in the middle of the City, an ancient Temple built by <hi>Agrippa,</hi> with Lead. And in the <hi>Vatican</hi> he not onely beautified the Pope's Houſe after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which we ſee, but he began the Walls of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> very large
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:50681:210"/>
and high, laying foundations for Towers, and a vaſt Superſtructure, whereby to keep the Enemy from plundering the Pope's Houſe, or St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, as formerly was often uſed. Furthermore, at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s he began a great Gallery to make the Church more glorious, and hold more People. He alſo repaired <hi>Ponte Melle</hi>: and built a fine Houſe at <hi>Viterbo</hi> near the Baths. Nor onely ſo, but he lent many others Money who were a building in the City; and by his order the Streets were paved. He was very Charitable, eſpecially to Perſons of Quality if they happen'd to be reduced to poverty; and gave poor Maids a competent Portion when they were married. He always received forein Embaſſadours very honourably and freely. He was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily anger'd, to ſay the truth, being a cholerick Man, but he was eaſily pleaſed again: and that gave ſome ill-natur'd People the occaſion to carp at him, though he deſerved extreamly well of God and Man. Then he was ſo far from Covetouſneſs, that he never ſold any Place, nor ever was guilty of Simony. He was kind to them, who had deſerved well of himſelf and the Church of God, a lover of Juſtice, the Author and preſerver of Peace, merciful to Offenders, a diligent obſerver of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and would omit nothing belonging to Divine Worſhip. The Veſſels of Gold and Silver, Croſſes ſet with Jewels, Prieſtly Robes adorn'd with Gold and Pearls, the Arras Hangings interwoven with Gold and Silver and a Papal Crown are yet to be ſeen as Monuments of his Munificence. I do not mention the many holy Books that were tranſcribed by his Order and emboſſed with Gold and Silver: but you may ſee the Pope's Library, which was wonderfully augmented by his care, and at his charge. He was ſo kind to the Religious that he gave 'em a great deal of Money and Eccleſiaſtical Benefices beſides; and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized S. <hi>Bernardine</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> a Frier <hi>Minor,</hi> becauſe by his Preaching, Admonitions, and Reproofs, he had almoſt extinguiſh'd the Factions of <hi>Italy,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and the <hi>Gibelline</hi> Faction, and ſhew'd Chriſtians the way to live well and happily: whoſe Body is now to be ſeen, and daily viſited with great veneration, at <hi>Aquila.</hi>

Firſt for his Education; he was but fourteen years old when, having laid the foundations of Learning elſewhere, he went to the Univerſity of <hi>Lerida,</hi> where he attained to ſuch perfection, that in a ſhort time he commenced Doctor in Civil and Canon Law, and made very learned Readings to thoſe that came to hear him. So that <hi>Peter Luna</hi> (called <hi>Benedict</hi> the XIII.) on his own accord and without asking, gave him a Canonſhip of the Church of <hi>Lerida.</hi> And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming famous for his Learning he went to <hi>Alphonſo</hi> King of <hi>Aragon</hi>; and was made his Secretary and one of his Privy Council.

was made Governour of the Church of <hi>Majorca,</hi> and his Friends per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him to be Parſon of that Church; he refuſed it, and ſaid, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be Biſhop of <hi>Valenza,</hi> as not long after he deſervedly came to be. For when <hi>Benedict</hi> the XIII. was dead, and thoſe two Anti-Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, which I told you of in the life of <hi>Martin,</hi> had made one <hi>Giles,</hi> a Canon of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> Pope (in the room of the other that dy'd at <hi>Pani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchola</hi>) whom they called <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth, <hi>Alphonſo Boria</hi> was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent thither by King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> (who was now agreed with <hi>Martin</hi>) not without apparent danger of his own life as well as thoſe that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on him: So tyrannically was <hi>Paniſchola</hi> kept, and govern'd by thoſe chiefly whoſe intereſt it was to breed diſcord. This <hi>Alphonſo</hi> then made <hi>Giles</hi> ſo ſenſible of his Errour by his Reaſon and Authority, that upon the arrival of <hi>Peter</hi> the Pope's Legat, he quitted the Popedom and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Papal juriſdiction. Upon this account <hi>Martin</hi> made <hi>Giles</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Majorca,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valenza.</hi> After that, when Wars aroſe between <hi>Alphonſo</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> and <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile, Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Borgia</hi> was thought the onely fit Man, to go and exhort the two Kings to peace and amity; which after ſeven years Wars he procured, and made ſuch a laſting Peace, by conjugal Alliances as well as other means, that ſome Conditions of that League are obſerved even to this day. But when the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> was at the heighth, King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who was then at War in <hi>Naples,</hi> being deſired to ſend ſome body thither, he order'd <hi>Alphonſo Borgia</hi> to go: who taking it ill that a thing of ſuch perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious conſequence ſhould be committed to his management, he got leave of the Queen, to go into <hi>Italy</hi> to the King with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the King's Son, and exhort him, that after ſo many dangerous expeditions, and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with which he was even at that time ſurrounded, he would return into his own Country. But the King told him he would not, but ſent him to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who was then at <hi>Florence,</hi> to treat concerning a Peace. For <hi>Viteleſchus</hi> having enter'd the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> in <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s name with an Army, plunder'd and ſpoil'd all that came before him, to hinder the King from taking <hi>Naples,</hi> which at that time he laid Siege to. But the buſineſs taking up time, and the Pope intending in the mean time to make twenty Cardinals, among the reſt deſign'd the Biſhop of <hi>Valenza</hi> ſhould be one: though he refuſed the honour with all the earneſtneſs imaginable; becauſe, he ſaid, it was not fit for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive eſpecially till he had done the buſineſs that he came for. Afterward <hi>Eugenius</hi> return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Aquilegia,</hi> whom he ſent to <hi>Tarracina</hi> to the King, having made a Peace between the Pope and the King, upon Conditions, at the making of which the Biſhop of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenza</hi> was preſent, and interpoſed his Authority and care, for which the Pope began to love him ſo well, that he ſoon after made him Cardinal <hi>Sanctorum quatuor,</hi> and ſent for him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he uſed no leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty in his Cardinalate, than he had before in his Biſhoprick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always free and far from pomp and vain-glory. When he ſpoke in the Senate, he was reckon'd ſo grave and ſincere a perſon that he never ſpake any thing out of flattery, or to win favour. But <hi>Eugenius</hi> dying and <hi>Nicolas</hi> after him, this <hi>Alphonſo Borgia,</hi> as I told you, was made Pope in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Palace, taking upon him the name of <hi>Caliſtus,</hi> and immediately proclaimed War againſt the <hi>Turks:</hi> ſhewing his own hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing whereby he had vowed to do ſo even before his Pontificate in
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:50681:211"/>
a Book of his to this purpoſe; <hi>I</hi> Calixtus <hi>do vow to God and the Holy Trinity that I will perſecute the</hi> Turks <hi>thoſe Enemies of Chriſtianity, with War, Curſes, Interdictions, Execrations and by all the ways I am able.</hi> All that were by admired at it, that he ſhould arrogate to himſelf the name of <hi>Pope</hi> before he had the honour conferr'd, and that a Man who was ſo old and decrepit, ſhould have ſo much courage. But that he might really perform his promiſe, he ſent Preachers through all <hi>Europe,</hi> to animate all Chriſtians againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and to perſuade ſuch as were able to lend their helping hand in that momentous Expedition. And of theſe he ſent ſixteen Gallies full, built at <hi>Rome</hi>; over whom the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Aquilegia</hi> was Admiral, and haraſs'd the Sea-coaſts of <hi>Aſia</hi> for three years together; where he took ſeveral Iſlands, and did the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my a great deal of damage. King <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> alſo took upon them the Croſs, and profeſs'd that they would either go againſt the Enemy in their own perſons, or at leaſt would raiſe Men to ſend. Yet this Affair as it was moved at an heat, ſo it as eaſily cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, whilſt the Princes indulged their pleaſures and neglected that which would have gain'd them immortal Fame. Whilſt the Pope was Crown'd in the <hi>Lateran,</hi> two Soldiers, one under the Earl <hi>Averſus,</hi> and the other under <hi>Neapolio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> (Men of diverſe factions and parties) who quarrelling about a young Lad, did ſo wound each other, that they both dy'd upon the ſpot. For that reaſon <hi>Neapolio,</hi> raiſing the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſine</hi> Faction, invaded the Houſe where the Count <hi>Averſus</hi> lived: but the Count being from home, he would have gone to the <hi>Lateran,</hi> to ſeiſe him, but was with much ado kept back by his Brother <hi>Latinus,</hi> the Pope's Chamberlain. And indeed <hi>Neapolio</hi> could not have gone thither without great damage to the City, becauſe all the Faction of the <hi>Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes,</hi> who favour'd the Count, were then in Arms. The Pope alſo had ſent <hi>John Baruncellus,</hi> and <hi>Laelius de Valle</hi> (two Advocates of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory) to both of 'em, to make 'em Friends: ſo that by this means the preſent diſturbance was appeaſed, but the old grudg betwixt them ſtill remain'd. For they had many trials of Skill to the great diſadvantage of their Adherents. The Pope however apply'd his mind to his Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Affairs, and Canoniz'd S. <hi>Vincent</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> of the Order of <hi>Preachers,</hi> and S. <hi>Edmund</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> and upon that occaſion ſaid Prayers and Thankſgivings from <hi>Eccleſia Minervae</hi> to S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s with a long train of Clergy and Laity following him. But leſt any thing ſhould be wanting to diſturb the Church, ſome Country Fellows of <hi>Palombara</hi> a Town in <hi>Sabina,</hi> who were formerly baniſh'd thence by <hi>James Sebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> Lord of the place, return'd home, and killing two Sons of <hi>James</hi>'s, promiſed to ſurrender the Town to the Church: which <hi>Calixtus</hi> not only refuſed to accept, but ſent Cardinal <hi>Columna</hi> thither, to appeaſe them. <hi>Neapolio</hi> fearing the Cardinal ſhould ſeiſe <hi>Palombara</hi> in his own name, he went thither with his Army and beſieged the Town for ſome days: Though when <hi>Matthew Poianus</hi> and <hi>Francis Sabellus</hi> with other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders came up by order from the Pope and the Cardinal, they raiſed the Siege, enter'd <hi>Palombara,</hi> and hang'd twenty of the Country Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, of thoſe eſpecially that had made the diſturbance, and quarter'd 'em, to give example to others, and warn 'em never to attempt ſo great a piece of Villany againſt their rightful Lords. Soon after appeared a Comet for ſome days hairy and red; of which when the Aſtrologers
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:50681:212"/>
ſaid that it portended a great Plague, Dearth, or ſome mighty Slaughter, <hi>Calixtus</hi> appointed a Faſt, for ſeveral days, to pray to God, that if any judgment hung over them, he would be pleaſed to avert and turn it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Turks</hi> the Enemies to Chriſtianity. He gave order likewiſe that God ſhould be ſupplicated every day, and that a Bell ſhould be rung about Noon, to give people notice when they ſhould joyn in Prayer for the Chriſtians againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> So that the Chriſtians aſſiſted by the Prayers of the whole Church, fought againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> at <hi>Belgrade</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Vaivod</hi> an excellent Perſon, and <hi>John Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranus</hi> of the Order of <hi>Minors,</hi> bearing the holy Croſs, and conquer'd 'em when they beſieged <hi>Belgrade,</hi> ſix thouſand of the Enemies being ſlain by a few of our Men, as <hi>Carviagalla,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Angelo</hi> wrote to the Pope and to <hi>Dominick Capranicus</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Croſſes:</hi> beſides that all their Carriages and an hundred and ſixty Guns were taken; a blow, that ſo much ſcar'd the <hi>Turk</hi> that he retir'd in haſte to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> And no doubt but that cruel, barbarous Nation had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, if the Chriſtian Princes would but have laid aſide their civil A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimoſities, and have purſu'd that great Conqueſt by Land and Sea, as <hi>Calixtus</hi> advis'd. But the <hi>Turk</hi> recovering ſtrength took <hi>Trabiſond,</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Emperour, and then <hi>Boſſina,</hi> where he took and ſlew the King. All wiſe Men perceiving as from a Watch-Tower, and advertiſing the Chriſtians of the Calamities that were like to befal. <hi>Calixtus</hi> eſpecially never deſiſted from exhorting the Chriſtian Princes by Letters and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, to open their eyes at laſt amidſt ſuch great dangers, for that they would ſeek a remedy in vain, when the Enemy was recruited. But whilſt the good Man was thinking and talking of theſe things, <hi>James Picenninus</hi> revolted from the <hi>Venetians</hi> and march'd into the Territories of <hi>Siena</hi> with a numerous body of Horſe and Foot, to demand of the <hi>Sieneſes</hi> ſome thouſands of pounds, which, he ſaid they ow'd him upon his Father <hi>Nicolas</hi>'s account, who had formerly fought under their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. The <hi>Sieneſes</hi> fearing the worſt, ſent to the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt 'em, as they were bound by Contract; eſpecially the Pope, who firſt adviſed 'em, not to give <hi>James</hi> one farthing and then ſent his Forces againſt him and admoniſh'd the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to do the ſame, leſt a flame ſhould break out in <hi>Italy,</hi> which might be too fierce for them to quench. The <hi>Italians</hi> fearing the Pope's words would prove too true, ſent ſpeedy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to the <hi>Sieneſes:</hi> onely <hi>Alphonſo</hi> favoured <hi>James</hi> and ſent for him to his Houſe, as being mindful of the Friendſhip he had formerly contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Nicolas Picenninus</hi> his Father, nor would he aſſiſt the <hi>Sieneſes</hi> as he ought to have done; nay he ſo far animated Count <hi>Petilian</hi> againſt them, that he ſeemed to be the chief cauſe of all the miſchief. But when the Auxiliaries came in, not onely from <hi>Francis Sfortia,</hi> but the <hi>Venetians</hi> alſo, <hi>Picenninus</hi> was reduced to that paſs in ſome few Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, that if he were not routed, he was mightily weaken'd, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at <hi>Orbitello</hi>; inſomuch that he was fain to take ſhipping in <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi>'s Gallies, that were ſent to him in his diſtreſs, and ſail into his own Country without any ſucceſs in that great Attempt. Thus by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of <hi>Calixtus</hi> and his Allies were the <hi>Sieneſes</hi> freed from great danger; though they were ſtill troubled with inteſtine and domeſtick as well as forein broils, by reaſon of ſome Citizens that contemn'd their preſent Liberty and follow'd <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s Faction, by whom alſo 'tis
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:50681:212"/>
thought that great War was firſt raiſed. But the honeſt Citizens turn'd out, or kill'd the reſt and do to this day retain that Liberty which they purchaſed at ſo dear a rate. Nor did they omit to puniſh the licentiouſneſs of the Soldiers or thoſe that fled from their Colours, as <hi>Gilbert Corrigia,</hi> whom they put to death, and gave his Men for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prey to the reſt. <hi>Sigiſmund Malateſta</hi> had like to have been ſerv'd in the ſame ſauce, who at that time fought under them, for protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the War, and driving away their Cattel out of their grounds, as if he had been an Enemy. That year there happen'd ſuch an Earthquake in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> upon the ſeventh of <hi>December,</hi> that many Churches and Houſes fell down, to the great deſtruction of Man and Beaſt; eſpecially at <hi>Naples, Capua, Cajetta, Averſa,</hi> and other Cities in old <hi>Campania,</hi> whoſe ruines I ſince have ſeen with great aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when I went thither to look after Antiquities. Then alſo did <hi>Alphonſo</hi> often repeat his Vow which he had made againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and ſaid he would ſhortly perform it; but he could never be brought to the Holy War for all that, ſo mightily was he taken with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of <hi>Naples.</hi> But <hi>Calixtus,</hi> when he had ſetled the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> created nine Cardinals, of whom two were his Nephews by two Siſters of his, to wit <hi>Roderick Borgia</hi> and <hi>John Miliano</hi> his Siſters Son. He alſo made <hi>Aeneas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Siena</hi> a Cardinal, and made uſe of him to procure the peace of <hi>Italy</hi> whilſt the <hi>Sieneſes</hi> were teazed with War. The Earl <hi>Tagliacocius</hi> being dead whom the Pope had made Governour of the City the year before, there roſe a Controverſie between <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> and the Count <hi>Averſus,</hi> for that the later had poſſeſſion of <hi>Monticello,</hi> not far from <hi>Tivoli,</hi> he pretending it belong'd to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-in-law who was the Count's Daughter; and <hi>Neapolio</hi> urg'd on the other ſide that it ought to be his, himſelf being reckon'd to be of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſine</hi> Family. Whilſt theſe two contended thus for their Patrimony and that with Arms too, the <hi>Roman</hi> people ſuffer'd very greatly. But when this Controverſie alſo was over, and both ſides commanded to lay down their Arms, <hi>Calixtus</hi> made his Nephew <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> not onely Governour of the City in the room of the Count deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but made him General of the Church-Forces, that he might keep the great Men of the City the better in order. <hi>Alphonſo</hi> not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dying without a lawful Heir, <hi>Calixtus</hi> had the courage to demand that Kingdom, and ſaid it belong'd to the Sea Apoſtolick as an <hi>Eſcheat.</hi> Whereupon Armies were raiſed on both ſides, and <hi>Ferdinand, Alphonſo</hi>'s Heir fear'd <hi>Calixtus</hi>'s reſolution: for he knew his nature, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Soul. But his death alſo put all things into confuſion, and freed <hi>Ferdinand</hi> from great conſternation of mind. <hi>Calixtus</hi> died in the third year, the third month, and ſixteenth day of his Pontificate, and was buried in the <hi>Vatican</hi> on the left hand of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, in the Round Church, dedicated to St. <hi>Marie del Febri,</hi> which was formerly repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Nicolas. Borgia</hi> alſo, his Nephew died, not long after, at <hi>Civita Vechia,</hi> whither he had fled to ſave himſelf from the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſins</hi> whom he had diſobliged by favouring the oppoſite Faction. But to give you a ſhort Character of <hi>Calixtus</hi>; He was a very upright Man, and is to be commended for one thing above all; That when he was Biſhop or Cardinal, he would never keep any Benefice <hi>in Commendam,</hi> but
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:50681:213"/>
ſaid, he was content with one Wife, and that a Virgin, <hi>i.e.</hi> the Church of <hi>Valenza,</hi> as the Canon Law ordains. Beſides, he was very chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to poor Chriſtians both in publick and private: and gave por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſeveral poor Virgins when they married; kept indigent Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men at his own charge: and when occaſion was he was munificent to Princes, eſpecially thoſe that could aſſiſt the Church of Chriſt. He likewiſe ſent <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bologna,</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Francis, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſun-Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanus</hi> Prince of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> and to the King of the <hi>Tartars</hi> with many great Preſents, to animate them againſt the <hi>Turk</hi>; and by his perſuaſion they did the Enemy great damage, and ſent their Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, that were deſign'd to come to <hi>Calixtus,</hi> after he dy'd, to Pope <hi>Pius:</hi> which was an admirable Rarity to us, not onely upon account of the diſtant Countries from whence they came, but their habit which was unuſual, and very ſtrange to our eyes. They ſay that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſun-Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanus</hi> after many Victories over the Enemy, wrote to the Pope, that he had conquer'd the Foe by the Pope's prayers, and that he would one day thank him for his kindneſs which was Divine rather than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. That Alliance was begun by <hi>Calixtus,</hi> and is preſerv'd to this day between all Chriſtians and that Prince, who vexes the <hi>Turk</hi> with continual War. He laid out but little in building, becauſe he dy'd too ſoon, and gather'd up all the Money that he could, to maintain that great and perillous War againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> Onely he repair'd St. <hi>Priſca</hi> upon the Mount <hi>Aventine,</hi> as alſo the City Walls that were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down almoſt to the ground. Yet ſome Hangings of Gold there are, which he bought. He was ſparing in his Diet, very modeſt in his Diſcourſe; and very acceſſible, as much as his Age would ſuffer him to be: for he was eighty years old, and yet as ſtudious as ever. For he either read himſelf, or heard thoſe that did, whenever his important Affairs would give him leave. He compoſed the Office for the Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and order'd it to be ſaid in the ſame manner, and with the ſame Indulgences for which <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> Day is ſo much valued. He receiv'd all Embaſſadours that came to him with great kindneſs, but would not yield to any of their Propoſals or Demands, which were not conſiſtent with Virtue and Juſtice. And that was the cauſe why he fell out and had a long quarrel with <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi> who ſometimes would ask him to give Biſhopricks to ſuch as either upon the ſcore of their Age, or ignorance in Books as well as Men, ought not to have them. When <hi>Calixtus</hi> dy'd he left 115000 <hi>l.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, which he had heaped together to make warlike preparations againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi> As <hi>Calixtus</hi> was going to be buried, <hi>Dominick</hi> Cardinal of St. <hi>Croſſes</hi> and chief Poenitentiary, died alſo (a Man of gravity and great Wiſdom) and was buried in <hi>Minerva</hi>'s Temple; to the grief of all good Men.</p>

Formerly his Father and the reſt of the Nobility being baniſh'd, or expelled the Republick of <hi>Siena</hi> by the Commonalty of that place, he went to <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignano,</hi> the Seat of his Family, and there had a Child by his Wife. Which Child as ſoon as it was born the Father chriſten'd <hi>Aeneas Sylvius.</hi> Now his Mother, when ſhe was big with Child, dreamed that ſhe had brought forth a Boy with a Mitre on his head; as which ſhe was affraid (as people are apt to think the worſt of things) that her dream beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened ſome diſhonour to their Child and Family: nor could ſhe be eas'd of her fear till ſhe heard her Son was made Biſhop of <hi>Trieſte.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that news ſhe was freed from all fear, and gave God thanks, that ſhe ſaw her Son more happy than ſhe expected. As ſoon as he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of learning any thing, he, having a good memory, and being very docile, went through his Grammar at <hi>Corſignano</hi> where he lived but poorly, being forced to undergo all the troubles of a rural employment. But when he was eighteen years of age he went to <hi>Siena,</hi> where, by the help of his Friends, he firſt learn'd the Poets and then the Orators, in which he was ſo skilful, that in a ſhort time he put forth Poems in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Italian,</hi> of which if the Subject was Love, it is to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to his Youth. Thence he apply'd himſelf to the Civil Law, the ſtudy of which not long after he was forced to leave. For there aroſe a War between the <hi>Sieneſes</hi> and the <hi>Florentines,</hi> which made him fear a Dearth; and ſeeing the Commonalty of <hi>Siena</hi> ſuſpected the Nobility, he choſe as it were a voluntary Exile, and follow'd that excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Dominick Capranicus,</hi> who then paſſed through <hi>Siena,</hi> in his way to the Council at <hi>Baſil,</hi> to complain of the injury <hi>Eugenius</hi> had done him in denying him a Cardinals Hat, which <hi>Martin</hi> even in his abſence had beſtow'd upon him, for his Virtue and Integrity. In his Retinue he went, and after long tedious Journeys over the <hi>Alps</hi> (that reach to heaven almoſt, and are cover'd with Snow) he travailed over <hi>Ponte del Inferno,</hi> the Lake of <hi>Lucern,</hi> and through <hi>Switzerland,</hi> till he at laſt came to <hi>Baſil.</hi> In which Aſſembly though he had much to do, being <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>'s Secretary, yet he ſtole always ſome hours for his Book. After that, he was forced not without tears to leave <hi>Dominick,</hi> becauſe he was extream poor, <hi>Eugenius</hi> denying him the Revenue of his Benefices and of his Paternal Eſtate too; he went to wait upon <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Novara,</hi> with whom he came to <hi>Florence,</hi> where Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> at that time was. But he was forced to leave <hi>Bartholomew</hi> alſo, (he being accuſed by the Pope of high Treaſon) and betook himſelf to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas,</hi> Cardinal of St. <hi>Croſſes,</hi> and a very excellent and religious perſon in all Mens judgments; who going to <hi>Artois</hi> by order from <hi>Eugenius</hi> (where there was a Convention of all the <hi>French</hi> Princes) he made a

Peace between the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> (an Ally of <hi>England</hi>) and the King of <hi>France.</hi> After that, <hi>Nicolas</hi> returning into <hi>Italy,</hi> made a Peace between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Millain</hi> to their great ſatisfaction; and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who was not very acceptable to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> went to <hi>Baſil,</hi> and was in great eſteem among all Men. He was made a Secretary in that famous Council, and Abbreviatour of the Pope's Breves, as alſo a <hi>Duodecimvir,</hi> or one of the Twelve who in that great Aſſembly were as Cenſors. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be done relating to the publick, but what paſs'd their graver approbation; and if any were admitted to the Council that were not fit, they were removed by their Order. There were in that Council four Sub Conventions or Committees, one debated concerning Faith, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Peace, a third of Reformation, and the other of promiſcuous matters. Over each of theſe there was a ſeveral Preſident plac'd every month: and <hi>Aeneas</hi> was often Chairman of the Committee for Faith of which he was a Member, and was alſo choſen twice one of the <hi>Collators,</hi> or diſpoſers of Benefices.

When any thing was to be done by the ſeveral Nations together, he was the onely perſon choſen for <hi>Italy,</hi> to manage their buſineſs, he was a Man ſo courteous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous.

And afterward when he was ſent Embaſſadour from <hi>Felix</hi> to <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, he ſo far prevailed upon him by his ingenuity, that he made him a <hi>Poet Laureat,</hi> his Companion, and a <hi>Prothonotary,</hi> which, in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> is a Secretary of State. Not long after he was made a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of State, and ſhew'd ſuch Learning and Authority, that he was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd the moſt ingenuous Man there by far, although he wanted not Rivals and Detractors. When <hi>Eugenius</hi> and the Emperour firſt treated about putting an end to the Schiſm, and <hi>Aeneas</hi> went to the Pope upon that account, he ſtay'd ſome time at <hi>Siena,</hi> where his Friends deſired him not to go to <hi>Eugenius</hi>; for they feared the Pope would uſe him ſeverely, becauſe his Authority was often oppoſed (as people ſaid) by <hi>Aeneas</hi> in Epiſtles and Orations at the Council of <hi>Baſil.</hi> But he was reſolute and truſting to his own innocence ſlighted the intreaties of his Relations and went to <hi>Rome</hi>; where in the firſt place he acquitted himſelf before <hi>Eugenius,</hi> in an elegant Oration, for ſubmitting to their Opinion, who approv'd of the Council of <hi>Baſil.</hi> And when he had ſo done, he began to treat with him about that which the Emperour ſent him to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate. Thereupon two Agents were ſent from <hi>Eugenius</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> of whom one was <hi>Sarzanus</hi> and the other <hi>John Carvagialla,</hi> by whoſe good management, and <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s induſtry together, the Neutrality (as I told you in the Life of <hi>Nicolas</hi>) was taken off. But that it might appear really to be ſo, and not in words onely, the Emperour ſent <hi>Aeneas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>Rome,</hi> to make a publick Declaration of Submiſſion in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:50681:214"/>
to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> in the name of himſelf and all <hi>Germany. Eugenius</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about this time, <hi>Aeneas</hi> was Preſident of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> till another Pope was choſen in the room of the deceaſed; there being no Orator in the City, more fit for ſo great an Employment. <hi>Nicolas</hi> being choſen Pope, he had leave to depart, and as he went into <hi>Germany,</hi> he (having been made Sub Deacon by <hi>Eugenius</hi>) was made Biſhop of <hi>Trieſte</hi> (that Biſhop being juſt then dead) by the Pope and the Emperour, without his own knowledg. After which <hi>Philip Viconti</hi> dying without an Heir, the Emperour ſent him Envoy to <hi>Millain:</hi> where he made an Oration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deſcent of the Inheritance of that City, and exhorting to Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, which if they preſerv'd inviolate, they might enjoy their liberty ſtill. He was ſent thither another time, when they were beſieged by <hi>Francis Sfortia,</hi> and ſuffer'd great extremities in defence of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; at which time he enter'd the City with great hazard alone; for his Collegues left him at <hi>Como,</hi> and durſt not go on for fear. But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence without any ſucceſs, and whilſt the Emperour ſent him to <hi>Alphonſo</hi> King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> the Pope <hi>Nicolas,</hi> made him Biſhop of <hi>Siena,</hi> the place of his Nativity. And when the Emperour and <hi>Alphonſo</hi> had contracted an Alliance by Marriage he return'd into <hi>Germany,</hi> where he perſuaded the Emperour to go as ſoon as poſſible into <hi>Italy</hi> and receive his Imperial Crown. Upon that advice <hi>Frederick</hi> went thither, but ſent <hi>Aeneas</hi> before, to meet and complement his Wife <hi>Leonora,</hi> who was to come from <hi>Portugal</hi> into <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> Who when he came to <hi>Siena,</hi> ſtay'd not long there, but he began to be ſuſpected by the people, as if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd (becauſe the Emperour was coming) to turn out the populace and make the Government an Ariſtocracy. <hi>Aeneas</hi> therefore, to free the people from that jealouſie, went to <hi>Talamone,</hi> where he thought <hi>Leonora</hi> would arrive; and yet the people were not ſatisfied. For they baniſh'd the Nobility into the Country for a time; and a little while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (according to the mutable humour of the <hi>Mobile</hi>) gave 'em leave to come back again, when they underſtood the integrity of the Emperour and the modeſty of <hi>Aeneas.</hi> Hence he went to <hi>Piſa,</hi> where he heard the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> were landed, and brought the Infanta (who was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his ſole care) to the Emperour, then at <hi>Siena.</hi> Then going to <hi>Rome</hi> he managed all things (whilſt the Emperour was crown'd) both private and publick. Afterward the Emperour went to viſit <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> and left <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> (a Princely Youth whom the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> had often endeavour'd to ſteal away from him) under the tutelage of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who kept him very faithfully. When the Emperour came back to <hi>Rome,</hi> and had given the Pope thanks, he went for <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and having made <hi>Borſius d' Eſte</hi> Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> he departed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And no ſooner was he come into <hi>Germany,</hi> but he preſently diſpatch'd away <hi>Aeneas</hi> by the Pope's Order as Envoy extraordinary into <hi>Bohemia</hi> and all the Cities of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> For there was a Controverſie between them and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour about King <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> whom they would needs have him ſend into their Country. But the Diſpute was ended, and a Peace made between 'em, ſo that <hi>Aeneas</hi> was not long after ſent to the Aſſembly at <hi>Ratisbone:</hi> where he, in the name of the Emperour, and in the preſence of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> ſpoke of the <hi>Turks</hi> cruelty and calamities of Chriſtendom with ſuch vehemency and paſſion, that he forced ſighs and tears from every one there; but eſpecially he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:50681:215"/>
ſo far to animate the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that a War was decreed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by general conſent: though it was after laid aſide through the ambition and folly of thoſe, who thought too well of themſelves. And now <hi>Aeneas</hi> was grown old, and tired with the tedious Journeys he had taken into forein parts; wherefore he reſolv'd to return to <hi>Siena,</hi> his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country: but the Emperour eaſily chang'd his mind, by telling him, that he yet deſign'd to make War upon the <hi>Turks.</hi> Thereupon he was ſent to the Convention at <hi>Frankfort</hi> where all the <hi>German</hi> Princes were met together, and in a grave, long Oration perſuaded them with many reaſons to undertake that dangerous, but neceſſary War. And indeed he ſeemed to move 'em all exceedingly: though it is natural for thoſe to cool ſoon whoſe affections are quickly heated. There was alſo a third Convention in <hi>Cittanova</hi> about the ſame thing, wherein <hi>Aeneas</hi> employ'd all his endeavours to bring about what he deſired; exhorting every one of them both in publick and private to aſſiſt in that War, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the ſafety of all <hi>Europe,</hi> the Liberty of both Princes and people, and the honour of Chriſtianity did depend. And juſt as he expected to do the buſineſs, there was news brought, that Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> was dead; which put all things into a new Confuſion. For the Convention broke up, and the <hi>Germans,</hi> deſirous of Novelty, endeavour'd to perſuade the Emperour no longer to obey the Pope unleſs he would grant them ſome certain Demands, for they ſaid, the <hi>Germans</hi> were in a worſe condition than either the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Italians,</hi> whoſe Servants they might be termed (unleſs things were alter'd) eſpecially to the <hi>Italians.</hi> And truly the Emperour had hearken'd to thoſe Mutineers, if <hi>Aeneas,</hi> with his gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had not interpoſed, and told the Emperour, That though one Prince may poſſibly keep peace with another, yet there always is an immortal jealouſie between Prince and People. So that, he thought it better for him to agree with the Pope, than give way to their deſires, whoſe minds are led by Appetite and Fancy, not by Reaſon. The Emperour was perſuaded: and ſlighting the peoples petition, ſent <hi>Aeneas</hi> to <hi>Calix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> He, when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and had given <hi>Frederick</hi>'s Oath to the Pope, as the cuſtom is, commended them both in an Oration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the greateſt part inforced a War againſt the <hi>Turks</hi>; ſo mighty zealous he was for it. For he was a wiſe Man and foreſaw what afterward came to paſs; That the <hi>Barbarians</hi> would not be quiet when they had gotten all <hi>Greece</hi>; they were ſo puft up with their Victory. For that reaſon he apply'd himſelf to make peace in <hi>Italy</hi> (before he made War with the <hi>Turk</hi>) and ſo exhorted the Pope to do the ſame with all earneſtneſs. At that time the <hi>Sieneſes</hi> were hard put to it by Count <hi>Petilian</hi> and <hi>James Picenninus,</hi> who carry'd on that War more upon <hi>Alphonſo</hi>'s account than their own. Wherefore <hi>Aeneas,</hi> to make a final concluſion of it, went by command from the Pope and at the requeſt of his Fellow-Citizens and Countrymen to <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> at <hi>Naples,</hi> where almoſt all the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of <hi>Italy</hi> were met to treat of Peace, but had done nothing in it to that time. But when <hi>Aeneas</hi> came, he ſaid he would agree to a Peace then without any more ado, ſince that perſon was arrived, whom he loved above all mankind. Having obtein'd a Peace, and freed his Country from the Enemy he ſtay'd with <hi>Alphonſo</hi> ſome months, becauſe he loved his Converſation; and in that time took his opportunity to make an elegant and a large Diſcourſe to him, by which he induced
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:50681:215"/>
him to engage by Sea againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi> And having ſo done he went for <hi>Rome,</hi> with a deſign to go into his own Country, but was ſtopp'd by the Pope, and not long after made a Cardinal. Now he was in ſuch favour with <hi>Calixtus</hi> and bore ſuch a ſway, that he perſuaded him to ſend Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to <hi>Siena,</hi> which was all in an uproar among themſelves, to exhort the People to peace and unity. But whilſt he was at the Bath at <hi>Viterbo</hi> upon account of his health, and had begun the Hiſtory of <hi>Bohemia, Calixtus</hi> died, and then he return'd to <hi>Rome:</hi> where he was ſo much deſired, that great part of the people ran out to meet him, and ſaluted him, prophetically, by the name of <hi>Pope.</hi> For indeed he was choſen Pope by univerſal conſent not onely of the people but the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals: and having received the Papal Crown upon the fifth of <hi>September</hi> he went into St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church in his pontifical Robes, where he gave thanks to Almighty God, and immediatly betook himſelf firſt to ſettle the Churches Patrimony, and then to endeavour the advantage of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in general. For he ended the War in <hi>Ombria</hi> (which broke out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Pontificate, under the command of that ſeditious Innovator <hi>James Picenninus</hi>) as ſoon as he was Pope, and took back <hi>Aſſiſi</hi> and <hi>Nocera</hi> from the Enemy. He likewiſe made a Truce (which ſeemed a difficult thing to do) between <hi>Sigiſmund Malateſta,</hi> and King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that all might ſafely paſs to <hi>Mantua,</hi> where he had order'd a general Council. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made the Prince of <hi>Columna</hi> Governour of the City in the room of <hi>Borgia,</hi> who was dead, and left <hi>Nicolas Cuſa,</hi> Cardinal of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>in vinculis,</hi> his Legate at <hi>Rome,</hi> he departed the City in the midſt of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and paſs'd through thoſe Cities which ſeemed more inclining to War than Peace, exhorting the People to unity and concord. In fine, they met at <hi>Mantua</hi> from all quarters, where there was a great number of Princes and Embaſſadours. For of all <hi>Europe</hi> there was no Nation, but ſent either Princes, or Embaſſadours thither; and in that famous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly it was enacted by <hi>Pius,</hi> (who made an Oration himſelf) that a War ſhould be proclaimed againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> which they all agreed to. He propoſed Methods for carrying it on, and ſhew'd the danger of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom: nor could they forbear to weep when they heard the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties laid open, to which poor Chriſtians were expoſed, who lay under the bondage of <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Beſide he moved them to conſider that the <hi>Turks</hi> having already poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Schlavonia,</hi> would ſhortly get into the innermoſt parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> And indeed he omitted nothing that might excite their reſolutions: for he was an excellent Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and ſeemed to draw his Arguments from new Topicks ſtill, though he ſpake of the ſame thing, ſuch an elegant and copious faculty he had. He confuted the complaints of the <hi>French</hi> and the calumnies of King <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> (for his having confirm'd <hi>Ferdinand, Alphonſo</hi>'s Son, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples</hi>) in three ſeveral Speeches. Theſe things were tranſacted in the Council at <hi>Mantua,</hi> whilſt almoſt all <hi>Europe</hi> employ'd their thoughts and Weapons in civil Diſcords, and neglected the forein War. The <hi>Germans</hi> aroſe partly againſt one another, and partly againſt the <hi>Hungarians:</hi> by whoſe aſſiſtance that great and neceſſary War might have been in a great meaſure managed and ended. <hi>England</hi> alſo was divided into two Factions: whereof the one would keep their old King, whilſt the other ſtrove to baniſh him and ſet up a new one. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner did the <hi>Spaniards</hi> riſe to help thoſe of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> whom the King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:50681:216"/>
aſſiſted by the <hi>French,</hi> oppreſs'd. And leſt any thing ſhould be lacking to diſturb the World, <hi>Italy,</hi> the chief of <hi>Europe,</hi> laid by all thoughts of forein War, and bent all its ſtrength upon inteſtine quarrels. For at that time there was a War in <hi>Puglia, John Renatus</hi>'s Son, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to drive <hi>Ferdinand</hi> out of his Kingdom, which occaſion'd a double Faction through all the Province, whilſt ſome favour'd <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and others, <hi>Renatus. Pius</hi> therefore, to allay theſe heats, diſmiſs'd the Council at <hi>Mantua,</hi> and came back into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> where he eaſily regain'd <hi>Viterbo,</hi> which was in the poſſeſſion of the adverſe Party. Thoſe of <hi>Anco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who had haraſs'd one another miſerably about their bounds and limits, he quieted partly by fear and partly by reaſon: as likewiſe the <hi>Ombri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who had embru'd their hands in each others blood upon the like account. He alſo ſetled the State of <hi>Siena,</hi> which had been engaged in great tumults for three years before; and reſtored ſeveral worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who had been baniſh'd thence, giving the Government of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick (as formerly) to the Nobility. But he was very ſevere upon the <hi>Sabini</hi> for their falſhood, in ſupplying a common Enemy with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and letting him paſs through their Country. At <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd the ſhameful Riots of Ruffian-like Men, and impriſon'd <hi>Tiburtius</hi> Son to <hi>Angelus Maſſianus</hi> (who we told you, was put to death by <hi>Nicolas</hi> for a Conſpiracy and hang'd up by the <hi>Capitol</hi>) and his Accomplices, who poſſeſſing themſelves of the Church of St. <hi>Maria Rotunda,</hi> would ſally from thence, as from a Caſtle, and commit outrages upon the Citizens. Furthermore, he exterminated ſome Tyrants who ſtudied innovations, out of the Church Dominions: but never medled with any one, till he had firſt ſent an Embaſſadour or Legate to 'em, to reduce 'em, if it were poſſible, by fair means. After that, he ſent <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral with <hi>Alexander Sfortia</hi> to <hi>Tagliacozzo</hi> to ſtop <hi>James Picennenus,</hi> who fought under <hi>Renatus,</hi> from going into <hi>Puglia</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>French</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> And beſides, he ſuccour'd <hi>Ferdinand</hi> at <hi>Sarno,</hi> when he had like to have loſt his Kingdom, for fear, the <hi>French,</hi> when they had once gotten that Kingdom, would make uſe of their Victory to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Liberty of <hi>Italy.</hi> He ſlighted the Threat and Promiſes of the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadours that endeavour'd to bring him over from <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> to <hi>Renatus</hi>; and by his Cenſures as well as Arms he tamed the fury of <hi>Sigiſmund Malateſta</hi> who was a Feudatary of the Church, and yet contemning the League, which the Pope had made between him and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> ſtorm'd and took all the Caſtles, which he had given for caution, againſt Law and Reaſon; and having driven the Churches Legate as far as <hi>Nulaſture,</hi> he made War upon the <hi>Anconeſes.</hi> But his extravagance was corrected the year after at <hi>Sinigaglia,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino</hi> and <hi>Neapolio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin,</hi> in a ſharp engagement, wherein they retook <hi>Sinigaglia,</hi> the Town called <hi>Fortunae Fanum</hi> was taken by <hi>Nicolas</hi> of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoia</hi> Cardinal Legate of St. <hi>Cecilys,</hi> and great part of <hi>Rimini</hi> taken from him, leſt he ſhould rebel any more. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> alſo had the ſame happy ſucceſs not long after at <hi>Troja,</hi> a Town in <hi>Puglia,</hi> by which the Prince of <hi>Tarento</hi> and many others, who, being deſirous of change, were on the <hi>French</hi> ſide, were ſo conſternated, that they came all upon their knees to the King and begg'd pardon of him; but ſome few continued obſtinate, whom the King afterward proſecuted ſo ſeverely, that he either drove 'em out of the Kingdom, or brought 'em to know themſelves. When
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:50681:216"/>
this was over, <hi>Pius,</hi> now freed from two great and troubleſom Wars, renew'd the thoughts of his Expedition into <hi>Aſia,</hi> which had been ſo long omitted from the time of the <hi>Mantuan</hi> Council through the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and avarice of the ſeveral Kings and Princes: and makes the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> his Confederates, becauſe they ſeemed more inclined to it, than any body elſe. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſent Nuncioes with Letters Apoſtolick to the ſeveral Nations of Chriſtendom, to exhort the Princes and people to ſo great and neceſſary a War: Himſelf in the mean time went to <hi>Siena,</hi> with a deſign to go as ſoon as the Seaſon permitted, to the Baths at <hi>Petriolana,</hi> that ſeemed beſt for his Diſtemper. And there he heard the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who had vowed to come with a Navy well Man'd, had deſiſted from his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as alſo, that many other Princes and people not onely Foreiners, but of <hi>Italy,</hi> led by ambition and envy, endeavour'd to fruſtrate that great Deſign, becauſe they ſaw, that they were likely to have the richeſt ſpoils and rewards, that underwent the greateſt brunt of that War. Thereupon (as it became a Pope to do) he try'd to perſuade 'em by kind words at a diſtance: and ſoon after leaving the Bath he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he lay ſick for ſome days of the Gout and a Fever, and therefore could not be at <hi>Ancona</hi> upon the ſeventh of <hi>June</hi> as he had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly declared he would. But when his diſtemper was ſomewhat aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged, he gave Audience to certain Embaſſadours that came from the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to excuſe their delay. And then calling all the Cardinals before him he appointed a day to hear the charge againſt the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who was ſaid to be heretically inclined: and when he had done, he was carried in a Litter through <hi>Sabina, Ombria,</hi> and the <hi>Marcha</hi> till he came to the City of <hi>Ancona.</hi> By the way be found great numbers of Men, that came out of <hi>Germany, Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for the War againſt the <hi>Turks:</hi> of whom he ſent a great part, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially of the <hi>Germans</hi> (having abſolv'd 'em) back into their own Country, becauſe he thought 'em unfit for the toil of War; and becauſe they had not brought their pay along with 'em, as he had order'd in the Letters Apoſtolical. But in the mean time, whilſt he waited at <hi>Ancona</hi> for the Navy that was a building in the ſeveral Ports of the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> and <hi>Adriatick</hi> Seas, and alſo for the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> his Ally, he was afflicted with a tedious Fever, and dy'd in the year 1464. upon the 13th of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> about three of the Clock in the Night, ſix years wanting ſix days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was made Pope. He was a Man of ſuch conſtancy and courage of mind, that in all his ſickneſs, which was long and painful, he never omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any buſineſs that concern'd his underſtanding onely, whether it were to hear the cauſes of ſeveral Nations, to inhibit, to decree, to judg, to ſign, to admoniſh, to chaſtiſe, or correct. And that day whereon he dy'd, about two hours before he expired, he call'd the Cardinals about him, and with a reſolute Heart and a good audible Voice exhorted 'em to Unity in the choice of a new Pope: commending to their care (in a grave Speech) the honour of God, the dignity of the Church, the War which he had undertaken againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> the ſalvation of his Soul, all his Family, and eſpecially his Nephews, if they proved worthy of commendations. He deſired all the Sacraments of his own accord, and ſhew'd great tokens of a true Chriſtian. But beſides that he diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very acutely with <hi>Laurentius Roverella,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:50681:217"/>
Divine, whether it were lawful for him to receive the Extreme Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction again, having been anointed once before at <hi>Baſil,</hi> when he was ſick of the Plague. Nor could he be entreated by all his domeſtick Servants to forbear ſaying the Canonical Prayers, though he were in ſuch an Agony. He repeated the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed with great ſtrength and Emphaſis; and when he had done, he ſaid, it was moſt true, and moſt holy. He was not affraid to die, nor did he ſhew any ſign of trouble or inconſtancy to his laſt breath. But indeed he may be ſaid rather to have been kill'd than to have died, he was ſo tortur'd with tedious Diſeaſes. He commanded his Friends to carry his Body to <hi>Rome:</hi> where thoſe that embalm'd him affirmed that his heart was very ſound and vivid. His funeral pomp from <hi>Ancona</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> was made up of his Family, who were all in mourning and in tears. And when that was over, he was buried in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at the Altar of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> in a Tomb, which was built at the charge of <hi>Francis,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Siena,</hi> with this Epitaph, <hi>Pius</hi> II. <hi>Pont. Max. natione Tuſcus, patriâ Senenſis, gente Pocolhominea.</hi> He enjoy'd the Sea onely ſix years: But though his Pontificate were ſhort, yet it was full of great Actions. He held a Council at <hi>Mantua</hi> to maintain the Faith; reſiſted all the oppoſers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> both within and without <hi>Italy</hi>; he canonized <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> and abrogated the <hi>French Pragmatic Sanction.</hi> He reſtored <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>; encreaſed the Churches Patrimony, and made the firſt Allum Mines at <hi>Tolfa</hi>; He was an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of Juſtice and Religion, and an excellent Orator: But he died at <hi>Ancona</hi> as he was going to the War againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> where he had his Navy ready, and the Duke and Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> for his fellow Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in Chriſt. He was brought thence into the City by order of the Cardinals, and buried in the place where he commanded St. <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apoſtle's head (which was brought hither to him from <hi>Morea</hi>) to be laid. He lived fifty eight years, nine months and twenty ſeven days; and when he dy'd, left the College of Cardinals forty five thouſand pound gather'd out of the Church Revenues, to maintain the War againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> But the Cardinals committed all this Money and the Galleys, that were then in the Port of <hi>Ancona,</hi> to <hi>Chriſtopher Maurus</hi> Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> who arrived there two days before <hi>Pius</hi> died, upon condition, that he ſhould uſe the Ships according to their directions, and ſhould ſend the Money to <hi>Matthias</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who was continually at War with the <hi>Turk.</hi> Thus died <hi>Pius,</hi> who was a perſonage of ſuch true courage and ſingular prudence; as he ſeemed to be born not to eaſe or pleaſure but to manage the moſt important Affairs. He always endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to augment the Majeſty and grandieur of the Pontifical Chair; nor did he ever leave chaſtizing of Kings, Dukes, States, Uſurpers, that wronged either himſelf or any other Church-Man, till he made 'em ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg their Errour. And therefore he was an Enemy to <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe he endeavour'd to diminiſh the Liberties of the Church, and extorted from him the <hi>Pragmatic Sanction</hi> which was moſt pernicious to the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> He threaten'd <hi>Borſius</hi> Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> who being a Feudatary of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet favour'd <hi>Sigiſmund Malateſta</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> who were no Friends to the Church. But he cenſur'd <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> moſt grievouſly, for taking <hi>Nicolas Cuſanus,</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of St. <hi>Peter ad vincula,</hi> and keeping him ſome days in Priſon. He
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:50681:217"/>
deprived <hi>Dieterus Iſimbergenſis</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> who hated the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and put another in his place: and ſo likewiſe he diſplaced the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Benevento,</hi> who was upon new projects, and endeavour'd to betray <hi>Benevento</hi> to the <hi>French.</hi> He likewiſe deprived <hi>Francis Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who in his Embaſſady to <hi>England,</hi> aſſumed more Power, than the Sea Apoſtolick had given him (to the deſtruction of many Men) him he deprived of his Biſhoprick of <hi>Teramo.</hi> He alſo made <hi>Terracino, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevento, Sora, Arpino</hi> and a great part of <hi>Campagnia</hi> ſubject to the Church. He never granted any thing to any King, Duke, or State for fear or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs; and would reprove Men ſeverely, that ask'd what he could not grant without detriment to the Church and diſhonour to himſelf; and ſtrook ſuch terrour into ſome Lords of <hi>Italy</hi> eſpecially, that they continued very true to their Faith and Allegiance. But as he always plagued his publick Enemies, ſo likewiſe he Cheriſh'd his Friends as much. He dearly loved <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Matthias</hi> King of <hi>Hungary, Ferdinand</hi> Son to <hi>Alphonſo, Philip</hi> of <hi>Burgundy, Francis Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and <hi>Lewis Gonzaga.</hi> He added twelve Cardinals to the former num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Cardinal of <hi>Rieti, Spoleto, Trani, Alexander Saxoferratenſis, Bartholomew Roverella, James</hi> of <hi>Lucca, Francis</hi> Son to his Siſter <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damia, Francis Gonzaga</hi> Son to the Marqueſs <hi>Lewis,</hi> all <hi>Italians.</hi> But then there were others from beyond the <hi>Alps</hi>; as, <hi>Salſeburgenſis, Lewis Libretus</hi> of <hi>Artois,</hi> and <hi>Vergelenſis.</hi> Moreover, he ſo ordered his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of living, that he could never be accuſed of idleneſs or ſloth. He roſe as ſoon as 'twas day for his health ſake, and, having ſaid his Prayers very devoutly, went about his worldly affairs. When he had done his mornings work, and walk'd about the Gardens for his recreation, he went to Dinner; in which he uſed an indifferent ſort of Diet; not curious and dainty. For he ſeldom bid 'em get him this or that particular Diſh, but whatever they ſet before him, he ate of. He was very abſtemious, and when he did drink Wine, it was always diluted with Water, and pleaſant rather than rough upon the Palate. After Meals he either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed or diſputed half an hour with his Chaplains, and then going into his Bed-Chamber he took a nap, after which he went to Prayers again, and then wrote or read, as long as his buſineſs would permit. The ſame alſo he did after Supper; for he both read and dictated till midnight as he lay in his Bed, nor did he ſleep above five or ſix hours. He was a ſhort Man, gray-hair'd before his time, and had a wrinkled Face before he was old. In his aſpect he bore ſeverity tempered with good-nature; and in his garb was neither finical, nor negligent, but ſo contrived it, as to be conſiſtent with the pains which he uſually took. He could patiently endure both hunger and thirſt, becauſe he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very ſtrong; and yet his long journeys, frequent labour, and Watchings had impair'd him. His uſual Diſeaſes were the Cough, the Stone, and Gout, wherewith he was often ſo tormented, that no body could ſay he was alive but by his Voice. And even in his ſickneſs he was very acceſſible, but ſparing of Words; and unwilling to deny any Man's Petition. He laid out all the Money he got together; and did neither love Gold nor contemn it: but would never be by, whilſt it was told out, or laid up. He ſeemed not to cheriſh the Wits of his Age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe three grievous Wars which he had undertook had ſo continually exhauſted the Pontifical Treaſury that he was oftentimes much in Debt:
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:50681:218"/>
and yet he preferred many learned Men to places both in the Court, and Church. He would willingly hear an Oration, or a Poem, and always ſubmitted his own Writings to the judgment of the Learned. He hated Lyars and Sycophants, was ſoon angry and ſoon pleaſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. He pardon'd thoſe that reviled, or ſcoff'd at him, unleſs they injur'd the Sea Apoſtolick; the Dignity whereof he always had ſuch a reſpect for, as upon that account often to fall out with great Kings and Princes. He was very kind to his Houſhold Servants; for thoſe that he ſound in an errour, through folly or ignorance, he admoniſh'd like a Father. He never reproved any one for ſpeaking or thinking ill of him; becauſe in a free City he deſired every body ſhould utter their minds. And when one told him, that he had an ill Report, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd; go into the <hi>Campo di fiore,</hi> and you'l hear a great many talk againſt me. If at any time he had a mind to change the Air of <hi>Rome</hi> for a better, he went, eſpecially in the Summer, to <hi>Tivoli,</hi> or his own Country, <hi>Siena.</hi> But he was mightily pleaſed with the retirement of an Abby in <hi>Siena,</hi> which is very delightful, and cool too by reaſon of its ſituation and the ſhady Groves that are about it. He frequented the Baths at <hi>Macerata</hi> and <hi>Petriolana</hi> for his healths ſake. He uſed thin Cloths, and his Expences in Silver look'd more frugal than Princelike. For his whole delight (when he had leiſure) was in writing and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: becauſe he valu'd good Books more than precious Stones; for in them he ſaid there was great plenty of Gems. He ſo far contemn'd a ſplendid Table, that he went oftentimes to Fountains, Groves, and Country receſſes for his own humour, where he entertain'd himſelf not like a Pope, but an honeſt humble Ruſtick. Nor were there wanting ſome who found fault with this his frequent change of places, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally his Courtiers; becauſe no Pope had ever done ſo before him, unleſs in time of War, or of a Plague. But he always ſlighted their Cavils, and ſaid, that for all his pleaſure he never omitted any thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted the dignity of a Pope or tended to the good of the Court. In all places he Sealed, heard Cauſes, Cenſur'd, Anſwer'd, Aſſerted and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed; to give full ſatisfaction to all ſorts of Men. He could not eat willingly alone, and therefore invited either the Cardinal of <hi>Spoleto,</hi> of <hi>Trani,</hi> or of <hi>Pavia</hi> commonly to Dine or Sup with him. At Supper he uſed to diſcourſe of Learning, and rubb'd up his old Notions of the Ancients; ſhewing how commendable each of 'em was in this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. He frequently exhorted his Relations to Virtue, and deterr'd 'em from Vice, by recounting the good or ill actions of others. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Patritio</hi> was his chief Reader, and <hi>Amanienſis.</hi> He was alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pleaſed to hear Wit, eſpecially when he had nothing to do: and therefore he had one <hi>Grecus,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> who would mimick and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule any ones behaviour, garb, or way of ſpeech with great diverſion to the Audience. He was an honeſt, upright, plain Man, without fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, or guile. And ſo zealous a Chriſtian he was, that there appear'd no colour of Hypocriſie in him. He frequently confeſs'd, and receiv'd the Communion; and at divine Service either performed the Prieſtly Office himſelf, or aſſiſted at the Ceremonies. He always contemn'd Dreams, Portents, Prodigies, Lightning, and the like. There was no ſign in him of fear or inconſtancy: but he ſeemed as little elevated at his good, as dejected at his ill Fortune. He often reproved his Friends,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:50681:218"/>
for Cowards, and ſneaking Fellows, that they ſhould be affraid of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him what miſchances they had (as it ſometimes happens) in the War: becauſe, he ſaid, thoſe things might have been remedied, if he had known of 'em in time. He never forſook his Allies, either upon account of Charges, or fear of his Enemies. He went to War with an ill will, but fought for the Church and Religion when he was forced to't. He was mightily pleaſed with Building: and at his charge were the <hi>Steps</hi> in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Church repaired; the <hi>Portico</hi> of it made glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſtrong: And he had a deſign to carry away the rubbiſh from before the Church-door, and pave the <hi>Piazza.</hi> He was about to make a <hi>Portico,</hi> from whence the Pope might bleſs the People. He built a Caſtle at <hi>Tivoli</hi> before people thought he had begun it: and at <hi>Siena</hi> he built his Countrymen a <hi>Portico</hi> of ſquare ſtone very high and very fine. As likewiſe he made <hi>Corſiniano</hi> (which he called <hi>Pienza,</hi> from his own name, <hi>Pius</hi>) a City: and built there a noble Church with a <hi>Cupalo,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a fine Houſe. He erected alſo a Tomb for his Father and Mother at <hi>Siena</hi> in St. <hi>Francis</hi>'s Church, with this Diſtich for an Epitaph.

He had four Nephews by his Siſter; of which the two youngeſt through his Authority, and the reſpect that was ſhewn him, were made Knights by the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The eldeſt, who had married King <hi>Ferdinand</hi>'s Daughter, was made Duke of <hi>Malphi</hi>; and the ſecond, whom <hi>Pius</hi> (as I told you before) had made a Cardinal, lives yet in ſuch repute of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and Vertue, that there is nothing wanting in him that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in an excellent Perſon: being adorn'd with Wit, Manners, Policy, Religion, Modeſty and Gravity. But to return to <hi>Pius</hi>; who never omitted his Studies though he were advanced to ſuch an eminent Station. When he was a Youth indeed and not yet initiated into Divinity, he ſet out Poems, that were rather light, and jocular, than ſerious and grave: and yet ſometimes even in them he was elevated, nor did he want ſatyrical ſharpneſs amidſt his merry Conceits. There are Epigrams of his extant, that are full of Wit, and he is ſaid to have written about three thouſand Verſes, which were loſt moſt part of 'em at <hi>Baſil.</hi> The remainder of his life he wrote in Proſe onely, his grand Affairs rather inclining him to it; but he alſo loved a mixt Stile, more fit for Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. He ſet forth ſeveral Books of Dialogues about the Power of the Council at <hi>Baſil,</hi> about the Riſe of <hi>Nile,</hi> of Hunting, of Deſtiny, of God's Preſcience, and of the Hereſie in <hi>Bohemia.</hi> He left an imperfect Dialogue which he began againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> in defence of Chriſtianity. He digeſted his Epiſtles into their ſeveral occaſions and ſeaſons when they were written: and thoſe that he wrote when he was a Layman, a Clergy, a Biſhop, or Pope he put into diſtinct Tomes: Wherein he excites Kings, Princes, and others to engage in the War for Religion. There is an Epiſtle of his extant which he wrote to the <hi>Turk,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him from Mahometaniſm to the Chriſtian Faith. He alſo wrote a Book about the Life of Courtiers; as likewiſe a Grammar for <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> the young King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> He farthermore compoſed thirty two O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, exhorting Kings, Princes, and Commonwealths to Peace, and in
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:50681:219"/>
defence of Religion, to promote the quiet and Concord of the whole World. He perfected the Hiſtory of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but left that of <hi>Auſtria</hi> imperfect. And though he was upon a Hiſtory of all the remarkable Actions in his Time, yet he was never able, for his buſineſs, to finiſh it. He wrote twelve Books and began the thirteenth of things done by himſelf. His Stile was ſoft and eaſie, in which he made ſeveral excellent, and pertinent Sermons. For he could readily move the Affections with handſom and graceful Expreſſions. He very aptly deſcribes ſituations of Places and Rivers, aſſuming various ways of Eloquence, as the occaſion required. He was well acquainted with Antiquity; nor could any Town be mention'd, but he could tell its riſe and ſituation: beſides that he would give an account in what Age famous Men flouriſh'd. He would ſometimes take notice of Mimicks for his pleaſure: and left many Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings behind him, of which I thought fit to add ſome to this account of his Life: to wit; That the Divine Nature was better underſtood by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving than by Diſputing. That all Sects though confirm'd by humane Authority yet wanted Reaſon. That the Chriſtian ought to be receiv'd upon its own credit, though it had never been back'd with Miracles. That there were three Perſons in the Godhead, not proved to be ſo by Reaſon, but by conſidering who ſaid ſo. That thoſe Men who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to meaſure the Heavens and the Earth were rather bold than certain what they did was right. That to find out the motion of the Stars had more pleaſure in it, than pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it. That God's Friends enjoy'd both this Life and that to come. That without Vertue there was no true Joy. That as a covetous Man is never ſatisfied with Money, ſo a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man ſhould not be with Knowledg; But that he who knew never ſo much, might yet find ſomewhat to be ſtudied. That common Men ſhould value Learning as Silver, Noblemen, as Gold, and Princes as Jewels. That good Phyſitians did not ſeek the Money but the health of the party diſeas'd. That a florid Speech did not move wiſe Men but Fools. That thoſe Laws are Sacred which reſtrain Licentiouſneſs. That the Laws had Power over the Commonalty, but were feeble to the greater ſort. That great Controverſies were decided by the Sword and not by the Laws. A Citizen ſhould look upon his Family as ſubject to the City, the City to his Country, his Country to the World, and the World to God. That the chief place with Kings was ſlippery. That as all Rivers run into the Sea, ſo do all Vices into Courts. That Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers draw Kings whether they pleaſe. That Kings hearken to none more eaſily than to Sycophants. That the tongue of a Flatterer was a King's greateſt Plague. That a King, who would truſt no body was good for nothing, and he that believed every body was no better. That it is neceſſary he that governs many ſhould himſelf be rul'd by many. That he deſerv'd not the name of a King who meaſur'd the Publick by his private abvantage. That he who neglected holy Duties did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Church Revenue, nor a King his Taxes, that did not conſtant Juſtice. He ſaid thoſe that went to Law were the Birds, the Court, the Field, the Judg, the Net, and the Lawyers, the Fowlers. That Men ought to be preſented to Dignities and not Dignities to the Men. That ſome Men had Offices and did not deſerve 'em, whilſt others deſerv'd 'em and had 'em not. That the burthen of a Pope was heavy, but he was happy who bore it ſtoutly. That an illiterate Biſhop was like an
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:50681:219"/>
Aſs. That ill Phyſicians kill'd the body, and ignorant Prieſts the Soul. That a wandring Monk was the Devil's Bondſlave. That Virtue had enriched the Clergy, but Vice made 'em poor. That there was great reaſon for the prohibiting of Prieſts to marry, but greater for allowing it again. That no Treaſure was preferrable to a faithful Friend. That Life was like a Friend and Envy like Death. That he cheriſhes an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who pardons his Son too often. That a covetous Man never pleaſes any body but by his Death. That Mens faults are conceal'd by Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and diſcover'd by Avarice. That it was a ſlaviſh Vice to tell Lyes. That the Uſe of Wine had augmented the Cares and the Diſtempers of mankind. That a Man ought to take as much Wine as would raiſe and not overwhelm his Soul. That Luſt did fully and ſtain every age of Man, but quite extinguiſh old Age. That Gold it ſelf, and Jewels could not purchaſe Content. That it was pleaſant to the good, but terrible to the bad, to die. That a noble Death was to be preferr'd before a diſhonourable Life in the Opinion of all Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>And this is all or moſt that can be written of <hi>Pius:</hi> except I add, that he canonized St. <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi>; and laid up St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s head, that was ſent from <hi>Morea</hi> to <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church with great Veneration, and Proceſſions perform'd by the Clergy and People, in a Chappel built on purpoſe: after he had clear'd the Church in that place eſpecially, and removed the Sepulchres of ſome Popes and Cardinals, that took up too much room.</p>

Whereupon he ſtay'd aſhore, and at the requeſt of his Friends and his elder Brother <hi>Paul Barbo,</hi> apply'd himſelf to his Book though he was pretty well in years, under the Diſcipline and tutelage of <hi>James Ricio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who uſed to commend his Diligence. He had alſo other Maſters, but made no great proficency, conſidering his Age; however he preferr'd 'em all when he came to be Pope (excepting only <hi>Ricion</hi>) to ſhew that it was none of their faults he was not made a Scholar. But <hi>Paul Barbo</hi> who was a ſtout and a wiſe Man, and knew his Brother's nature inclined him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eaſe than buſineſs, intreated <hi>Eugenius</hi> (whom he went to viſit at <hi>Florence</hi>) to ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> and give him ſome Eccleſiaſtical preferment. He did ſo, and <hi>Peter</hi> was made firſt Arch-Deacon of <hi>Bologna,</hi> with which not long after he held the Biſhoprick of <hi>Cervia</hi> in <hi>Commendam,</hi> and was made a Protonotary; one of that Rank who receive the greateſt Fees. In this condition he lived for ſome years, till at laſt he was made a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:50681:220"/>
at the ſame time with <hi>Alouiſius,</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Padua,</hi> whom they afterward call'd <hi>Patriarch</hi> and <hi>Chamberlain:</hi> which was done at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of ſome Friends of <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s, who deſired to have a Man that might thwart <hi>Alouiſius</hi> upon occaſion. And indeed it happened after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that they grew ſuch Enemies as never were known, by the inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of others eſpecially whoſe intereſt it was to foment the Quarrel. For <hi>Peter</hi> was vexed that he ſhould be inferiour to any Man about <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi> ſince he was his Nephew, and of a <hi>Patrician</hi> Family in <hi>Venice.</hi> Upon this account he fell out moſt grievouſly with <hi>Francis Condelmerius</hi> the Vice-Chancellour, who was <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Couſin-german: and when he died, he turn'd all his fury upon the Patriarch, though they two had been often ſeemingly reconcil'd by the interceſſion of Friends. Hereupon they were ſuch Enemies to one another in ſeveral Popes Reigns, that they did not ſpare each others either Eſtate, or honour: but mutually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled each other in words, which I will not relate, leſt I ſhould ſeem to believe 'em. But when <hi>Eugenius</hi> was dead and <hi>Nicolas</hi> the Fifth in his place, he prevailed ſo far upon him by his kindneſs and flattery, that he not onely got the uppermoſt place of all his Nation in <hi>Nicolas</hi>'s Court, but by aſſiſtance of <hi>Nicolas</hi>'s Brother, did ſo animate him againſt <hi>Alouiſius,</hi> that he retrenched the Chamberlain's Office. For <hi>Peter Barbo</hi> was naturally fair ſpoken, and could feign good nature, when occaſion ſerv'd. But he was ſometimes ſo mean ſpirited, that when he could not obtain what he aimed at by praying, intreating, and requeſting, he would joyn tears to his Petitions to make them the ſooner believed. And therefore Pope <hi>Pius</hi> uſed ſometimes to call him the godly <hi>Mary,</hi> by way of joke. He alſo uſed this wheedle with <hi>Caliſtus,</hi> and perſuaded him to ſend <hi>Alouiſius</hi> with certain Gallies againſt the <hi>Turk</hi>; ſhewing him by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that ſuch a Perſon was fitteſt for ſuch an Expedition, becauſe he had not onely been a Commander formerly, but had ſtoutly defended the Church-patrimony againſt all its Enemies. <hi>Peter</hi> being at laſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from that eye-ſore, made <hi>Caliſtus</hi> always ſo far of his Opinion, that he uſed no bodies advice more than his, as long as he lived. So that he eaſily obtain'd of the Pope whatever he ask'd either for himſelf or his Friends. For he was ready to do friendſhips and kindneſſes for any Man whom he undertook to protect or aſſiſt not onely before the great Men in general, but with the Pope alſo. Yea ſuch was his humanity, that he would viſit his Domeſticks that were ſick (if they were Men of any account) and apply Remedies to 'em. For he had always at home Medicaments brought from <hi>Venice,</hi> with Oil, Treacle, or other things fit for Medicines; and ſome of theſe he often ſent to the ſick. He took care that the Wills of ſick People ſhould be intruſted with himſelf rather than any body, to diſpoſe of as he thought fit; for if any thing in them concern'd him, he preſently ſold part of the goods by Auction, and turn'd it into Mony for his own uſe. He was pleaſed with the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of ſome particular <hi>Romans,</hi> whom he often invited to Dine with him, for his diverſion: and was often very well pleaſed at the Wit, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickry, Gibes, Taunts and civil Affronts that came from <hi>Priabiſius</hi> and <hi>Francis Malacaro.</hi> By this means he engaged the reſpect of the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> and even the Courtiers alſo. But that he might not ſeem powerful at home onely, he endeavoured to make an Intereſt abroad too. For he went into <hi>Campagna di Roma</hi> to appeaſe certain People that
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:50681:220"/>
were at variance about their Confines: and whilſt he endeavour'd to reconcile the Count <hi>d' Averſa</hi> to <hi>Neapolio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin,</hi> he had like to have been taken and put into Priſon for words which the Count reſented very highly. Wherefore he went away without his Errand, and from that time always ſhew'd himſelf <hi>Averſa</hi>'s Enemy. After that <hi>Calixtus</hi> died, into whoſe room <hi>Pius</hi> ſucceeded, when he, endeavouring to change his Biſhoprick of <hi>Vincenza</hi> for that of <hi>Padua,</hi> by troubleſom importunities, and requeſts, ſo far provoked Pope <hi>Pius</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that they turned out his Brother <hi>Paul</hi> from being a Senator, and interdicted him from enjoying any Church Benefice, if he would not alter his mind. At which the Man was ſo angry that he waited onely for a time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf, and was very invective in the mean while againſt thoſe, that obſtructed his Deſign, But when <hi>Pius</hi> was dead and he put in his place, he no ſooner came to the honour but immediately he turned our all the Clerks of the <hi>Breves,</hi> which <hi>Pius</hi> had put in, pretending they were either uſeleſs or unlearn'd: whether he had ſo promiſed, or that he hated <hi>Pius</hi>'s Acts and Decrees, no body can tell. For he ſtrip'd them of their goods and preferments without hearing what they could ſay for themſelves, whom he ought to have invited from all parts of the World with Encouragements and Rewards; that College being then full of good and learned Men. For there were Men very skilful in the Laws both Divine and Humane: as likewiſe Poets and Orators, who were as great Ornaments to the Court, as that was honour to them; yet <hi>Paul</hi> turn'd 'em all out, though it had been order'd by Letters Apoſtolick and the Judges of the Pontifical Treaſury, that no Man who bought his place honeſtly ſhould be put out of it. And yet thoſe that were concern'd did what they could to change his mind: and among the reſt I entreated him, that it might be referr'd to the publick Judges, whom they call <hi>Auditors</hi> of the <hi>Rota.</hi> At which he look'd upon me with a ſtern aſpect, and told me,
<q>Do you (ſaid he) refer me to Judges, as if you were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that all the Laws were laid up in my Breaſt? I am reſolv'd (ſaid he); let 'em all be gone whither they will I value 'em not; I am Pope, and I may do as I pleaſe, either in reſcinding or approving the acts of others.</q>
When we heard this ſevere Sentence, we travel'd about and ſtrove to rowl an unmovable ſtone, attending Perſons of the Court Day and Night, and vainly beſeeching every mean Servant to procure us admiſſion to the Pope. For we were rejected with reproachful Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as if we had been excommunicated perſons, or Pagans. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding we attended twenty Nights together; becauſe he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in a manner, but what he did by Night. At laſt I was ſo concern'd for the diſgrace which he put upon us, that (ſeeing I and my Aſſociates could not come to ſpeak with him) I was reſolv'd to ſend him a Letter, which I wrote to this purpoſe:
<q>If you had power to ſtrip us of all we had juſt and lawful right to, then it ought to be in our power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the injury and diſgrace that you have done us. And therefore ſeeing we are rejected by you with ſo much ignominy, we will appeal to all the Kings and Princes far and near, and deſire 'em to convene a Council, where you may be forced to ſhew thy reaſon, why thou rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſt us of our Livelihoods:</q>
When he had read the Letter, he ſent for <hi>Platina,</hi> as a Traytor; put him into Priſon and fetter'd him; and then ſent <hi>Theodore,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Treviſo,</hi> to examine him. He ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:50681:221"/>
me guilty, for diſperſing Libels againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> and mentioning a Council. The firſt Objection I thus refuted; to wit,
<q>That thoſe were called Libels, in which the Name of the Writer was conceal'd; but my name was at the bottom of the Letter, and therefore it was no Libel. And as to my making mention of a Council; That I did not think ſo great a fault, ſeeing the fundamentals of true Faith were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the holy Fathers in Synods, which had been ſown by our Saviour and his Diſciples, to the end, that all both great and ſmall might live peaceably together and have right done them. And that by the Laws of <hi>Rome,</hi> not onely private but publick perſons were to give an account of their lives and how they diſcharged their Truſts.</q>
But when I could do no good this way, I was forced to be content and lie in maſſie Chains in the middle of Winter without any fire, and in an high Tower, which was expoſed to all the Winds that blew for four months together. At laſt <hi>Paul</hi> was tired with the importunity of <hi>Francis Gonzaga</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and freed me from the noiſom Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though I could hardly ſtand upon my Legs; and withal he bids me not ſtir from the City: For (ſays he) if you go into <hi>India, Paul</hi> will fetch you back. I obey'd his Commands; and ſtayed three years in the City, hoping to find ſome remedy for my misfortunes. But <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was Crown'd, according to cuſtom, remembring that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons Regular were formerly turn'd out of St. <hi>Giovanni Laterano</hi> by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus,</hi> though <hi>Eugenius</hi> had placed 'em there; he recall'd 'em, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Divine Service apart from the Canons Secular. And becauſe he had a mind to extirpate the name of <hi>Seculars</hi> from that place, if any one of 'em died, he put no body into his place; or if any Benefice were vacant, he made them renounce their Canonſhips and ſo tranſlated 'em to other Churches, till at length the profits of that Church being reduced into one body might ſatisfie the Canons Regular without any charge to him, he being before forc'd to keep 'em, they were ſo poor. But by this means <hi>Paul</hi> did much eſtrange the Citizens minds and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from him: becauſe (as they ſaid) he gave thoſe Revenues which their Forefathers had ſetled (inſtead of Citizens) to foreiners. Nor was <hi>Paul</hi> content to do ſo, but he ſpoke to ſome Canons by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and threaten'd 'em till they quitted their Canonries. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed contemn'd his Menaces and expected an opportunity of vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Liberty, which happen'd not till he was dead. It was now reported that the <hi>Turks</hi> had taken moſt part of <hi>Epirus</hi> and were coming into <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> he therefore ſent Nuncio's immediately to all Kings and Princes, to adviſe 'em, to compoſe their civil Diſcords and make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Turk</hi> the common Enemy; but there was nothing done in it, becauſe they were up to the ears in blood one among another: the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> in one part and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in an other, ſome of whom deſired a new King, others would retain their old one. And then the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Princes, fear'd their King's Power, who attempted to bring them to a total ſubjection. But more than this, the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi>'s Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy vexed <hi>Paul</hi> very much, in that he withdrew himſelf from the Church of Chriſt by little and little; and therefore he deſign'd to ſend the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> with an Army againſt him, if the War which he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> would give him leiſure; and that he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the difference between the King and the Emperour. For when
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:50681:221"/>
                  <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> and his Nephew was dead, without iſſue, the Emperour himſelf pretended a right to that Kingdom, which <hi>Matthias</hi> Son to the <hi>Vaivod</hi> was in poſſeſſion of. Thereupon <hi>Paul</hi> thought it beſt to defer that matter till another time, and apply'd himſelf to make up ſome breaches between certain Citizens of <hi>Rome.</hi> For there was a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel between <hi>James</hi> Son to <hi>John Alberinus,</hi> and <hi>Felix</hi> Nephew to <hi>Anthony Capharellus:</hi> and therefore he ſent for the two old Gentlemen, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Uncle of 'em, and cauſed 'em to put in Sureties, that they would be friends, though they ſtood out a good while. But <hi>James</hi> Son to <hi>Alberinus,</hi> who could not endure that any Affront ſhould be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Father, attempted ſoon after to murther <hi>Anthony Capharellus,</hi> and gave him ſeveral ſuch grievous wounds that he left him for dead. At which <hi>Paul</hi> was very angry, that <hi>Alberinus</hi>'s Son had broken his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Oath, and therefore he demoliſh'd their Houſes, confiſcated all their goods and baniſhed them from the City, but he afterward recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led 'em and took 'em into favour, reſtoring all their goods; and made Peace between the parties after they had been both ſometime in Priſon. In the year 1465. <hi>Alouiſius Patavinus</hi> the Pope's Chamberlain dy'd. He was Cardinal-Prieſt of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> a very rich Man and prudent in the management of buſineſs, but not ſo wiſe towards his later end: in that he left moſt of his Eſtate to his two Brothers who were call'd <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rampi.</hi> Men that were good Gentlemen, but yet not worthy of ſuch a vaſt fortune as he had got out of the Church Revenues (I know what People thought) whereupon <hi>Paul,</hi> who had given him free leave to make a Will and bequeath it to whom he pleaſed, ſeized upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, took the <hi>Scarampi</hi> who had fled and kept 'em (though in no ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous place) till he had thoſe things brought him which were carried away to <hi>Florence</hi>; which done, he freed the <hi>Scarampi,</hi> to whom he gave a good ſhare, and was more liberal to the other Legatees than the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor himſelf had been. And thus <hi>Alouiſius</hi>'s Eſtate, which he got with great induſtry and preſerv'd with greater, (as if in the ſtrength of ſo much Wealth he could have lived <hi>Mathuſalem</hi>'s Age) was ſeized and diſtributed by one with whom he had had ſo many quarrels, ill words and Animoſities, and before whom he would have choſen the <hi>Turk</hi> for his Executor. Nor was Divine Providence thus ſatisfied, but was pleaſed that his body alſo which was already buried ſhould be made a prey; for the Grave was open'd in the Night-time by thoſe to whom he had given the Revenues of St. <hi>Laurence</hi> in <hi>Damaſo,</hi> and he ſtript of a Ring and all his Cloths. But indeed <hi>Paul,</hi> when he knew of it, was very angry at them. About that time <hi>Frederick</hi> a fine Youth, Son to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who paſſing to <hi>Millain,</hi> to fetch <hi>Francis Sforza</hi>'s Daughter, his Brother's Wife, to <hi>Naples,</hi> arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was met by the Nobility and <hi>Rhoderick</hi> the Vicechancelour, and kindly entertain'd by the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who preſented him with a Roſe, which the Popes uſe to give to ſome Chriſtian Prince every year. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> now minding to puniſh thoſe of his own Kingdom, who had revolted from him when he was engaged with the <hi>French,</hi> ſent ſome Forces to ſet upon the Duke of <hi>Sora</hi>; but the Pope was deſirous to divert that War, and therefore ſent the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Millain</hi> thither with all ſpeed, to pray him, that he would ſend thoſe Men to him (as he was obliged by his Tenure to do) becauſe he had a Deſign to deſtroy and take off the Count <hi>Averſa</hi>'s Sons that
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:50681:222"/>
had denied Obedience to the Church. For about that time the Count <hi>Averſa</hi> died, when <hi>Paul</hi> was made Pope; and his body was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> where it was buried in St. <hi>Maries</hi> the Great. The King, who was <hi>Deiphobus</hi>'s bitter Enemy, as having been attempted by him with Plots, Poiſon and open force in the late War, gave Order to the Captains of his Army, cited to go where the Pope bad them, upon the firſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. He had <hi>Deiphobus</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> to him before and given 'em charge to clear the Road of Thieves, (who uſed to rob Travellers at the very Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it were) and that they ſhould reſtore <hi>Capra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rola</hi> (a Town ſo called) to the Son of <hi>Securanza,</hi> the greateſt part of whoſe Eſtate they had poſſeſt themſelves of: they not onely refuſed to do either, but threaten'd him, and brag'd that they were Count <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>'s Sons, nor would they ſpare any one that gave 'em a provocation. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore having privately prepared all things that were neceſſary for a War, with aſſiſtance of the King's Forces, he ſurpriſed and ſubdued 'em within fourteen days after he attaqued 'em, reducing nine Caſtles under the juriſdiction of the Church: of which ſome were ſo well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied both by Art and Nature, that they ſeemed impregnable. <hi>Deiphobus</hi> fearing leſt if he were taken he ſhould be ſent to the King, made his eſcape. But <hi>Francis</hi> his Brother and his Son were taken and kept five years in <hi>Caſtel St. Angelo,</hi> till upon the Creation of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> they were freed. And hence afterward aroſe great enmity between the Pope and the King; when <hi>Ferdinand</hi> demanded that <hi>Paul</hi> would remit the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute which he was to pay the Church, as a reward for his great merits: and would retrench or take off part of it for the future, ſeeing his Uncle enjoy'd the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> though he paid Tribute for that and <hi>Naples</hi> too: and told him, That he ought to conſider his Deſerts and what might happen; for that he had always ſome Batalions in Arms, not more upon his own than upon the Pope's account as he found in the late War againſt the <hi>Averſans. Paul</hi> on the other hand recounted the Churches merits toward <hi>Ferdinand</hi>; and ſo they ſpun out the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate a long time by theſe kind of wranglings, each of 'em ſeeking an opportunity to recover their Right. In the mean time the King was very cautious how he cauſed any new Commotions, becauſe he fear'd <hi>James Picenninus</hi>'s Power, who had <hi>Sulmona</hi> in <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> and ſome other Towns in his poſſeſſion: whom afterward his Father-in-law <hi>Francis Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> ſent to the King, who gave him his word that he ſhould come and go in ſafety when he pleaſed. But all things did not go according to <hi>James</hi>'s expectation: for he was taken at <hi>Naples</hi> by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as ſo was his Son, and there thrown into Priſon, and not long after put to Death; though there was a falſe report given out, that he fell down in the Priſon and broke his Leg, as he was inconſiderately ſtaring through the Window to ſee the King's Galleys that came from <hi>Iſchia,</hi> with Victory over the <hi>French.</hi> There were who thought him ſtill alive: which I can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe there was no Man in all <hi>Italy</hi> more fit (if you look upon him as a Soldier) to ſubvert the Government of King <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Millain</hi>'s Daughter, when ſhe heard of it, tarry'd by the way at <hi>Siena,</hi> as ſhe was going to her Husband at <hi>Naples,</hi> to perſuade the World, that her Father was not any way concern'd with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in contriving the Death of <hi>Picenninus.</hi> But what People thought of it, we very well know. There were likewiſe ſome, that ſaid, the Pope knew
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:50681:222"/>
of it before hand, becauſe at that time the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Millain</hi> went often from the Pope to the King, and from the King back again: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, when he heard of his Impriſonment, that the Judg of Appeals was taken off. But that of <hi>Virgil</hi> is too true,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Neſcia mens hominum fati, ſortiſque futurae.</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Little do Men their future Fortune know.</l>
                  </q>
For <hi>Paul</hi> could not have made uſe of any one to fit to curb <hi>Ferdinand</hi> as <hi>James Picenninus</hi> was, if he had been alive, when their Debate aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Tribute, for which a War was like to have been proclaimed. For when he had kept his Daughter-in-laws, and his Son's Wedding, and that thereby and by the death of <hi>James</hi> his Kingdom was ſetled, <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> was inſtant with the Pope, that he would retrench the Tribute, and give him back certain Towns which belong'd to the Kingdom but were in poſſeſſion of the Church. Thereupon <hi>Paul</hi> ſent to him <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew Roverella,</hi> Cardinal Prieſt of St. <hi>Clements,</hi> as Legate; who did in ſome meaſure ſatisfie the King. And at that time I believe, they both fear'd, leſt the Eclipſes of the Sun and Moon, which all Men were then aſtoniſh'd at, might portend ſome changes in Government. Nor can you think the heavenly Bodies have no efficacy; for the year after <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> Duke of <hi>Millain</hi> and <hi>Genoua</hi> died. For he had gotten <hi>Genoua</hi> two years before, being after a long War ſurrender'd by the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. For they having rejected the <hi>French</hi> Government which they had formerly courted, kill'd ſix thouſand of the <hi>French</hi> under the Noſe of King <hi>Renatus,</hi> who came with ſome Galleys well arm'd, to retrieve the City that had now revolted from the <hi>French.</hi> When <hi>Francis Sfortia</hi> Duke of <hi>Millain</hi> was dead, <hi>Paul</hi> ſummon'd the Cardinals to conſult what was to be done. They all concluded that he muſt ſend Letters and Nuncioes to all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to all States, to perſuade 'em againſt Innovations, and to maintain the eſtabliſh'd Peace; eſpecially at that unhappy time when we were ſo threatned by the <hi>Turk</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy. And afterward he ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Conca</hi> to <hi>Millain,</hi> to perſuade that State, to have regard to the Allegiance they had ſworn to <hi>Galeatius, Francis</hi>'s Son. At that time <hi>Galeatius</hi> was abſent in <hi>France,</hi> whither his Father had ſent him with an Army, to aſſiſt King <hi>Lewis</hi> againſt the Princes of his Kingdom, that acknowledg'd not his Authority. For <hi>Francis</hi> was bound by the League he made with him, when he poſſeſt himſelf of <hi>Genoa,</hi> to ſupply him with ſome Auxiliaries: Beſides the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance which they had contracted obliged him to it; for he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Siſter of the Queen and the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> When he heard of his Father's Death, he relinquiſh'd the War which he engaged in upon the King's account againſt the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and going from <hi>Lions</hi> return'd with a ſmall Retinue and in a diſguiſe to his own Country, where he peaceably poſſeſs'd himſelf of his paternal inheritance by the help of his Mother who kept the people in Obedience till he came. But <hi>Paul,</hi> when the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> were thus compoſed, hearing that the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Soldiers were ready to ſtarve, he ſummon'd the Grand Maſter (and the great Clergymen) to <hi>Rome,</hi> to conſider of a Relief, who after frequent meetings in St. <hi>Peters,</hi> died for grief and Age, and was buried in that Church, not far from St. <hi>Andrew'</hi>s Chappel: in whoſe room
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:50681:223"/>
                  <hi>Charles <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> was choſen and ſent immediately to defend the Iſland. In the mean time when <hi>Paul</hi> heard that there were a great many Hereticks in <hi>Tagliacozzo,</hi> he having heard their cauſe ſeverely branded the Lord of the place, eight Men and ſix Women (which were caught and brought before him) being thoſe that were moſt obſtinate; but dealt more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably with thoſe that confeſſed their Error and begg'd pardon. They were of thoſe perverſe ſort of Hereticks who ſay, there never was any true Vicar of Chriſt ſince St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but who had imitated Chriſt's Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. Then he encreaſed the number of Cardinals; and made ten at one time, of which number were <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Savona</hi> General of the Order of <hi>Minors,</hi> M. <hi>Barbo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vincenza,</hi> whoſe Advice he always took in great Affairs, <hi>Oliver</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Naples, Amicus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aquila,</hi> and <hi>Theodore Montferrat</hi>; and the reſt were partly <hi>French, Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Having thus augmented the College, he apply'd himſelf wholly to ſettle the peace of <hi>Italy.</hi> For certain <hi>Florentines,</hi> who were baniſh'd by <hi>Peter Medices</hi>'s Faction in a civil Tumult (as <hi>Deteſalvus Neronius, Angelus Accioiolus,</hi> and <hi>Nicolas Soderinus</hi>) had perſuaded <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi> of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> who had a good Army of Horſe and Foot, to march into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and reſtore them and all the other baniſh'd Perſons to their Country, the <hi>Venetians</hi> under-hand lending their aſſiſtance; theſe ſeem'd to be able and to deſign to overthrow the State of <hi>Italy</hi> at firſt daſh. But <hi>Galeatius</hi> D. of <hi>Milan</hi> with the Forces of the King and of the <hi>Florentine</hi> people poſting himſelf in his way, he ſlacken'd his march and endeavour'd to get the better rather by protracting the War than by fighting. One fierce Battel however under the conduct of the Count of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> they fought in the Territories of <hi>Bologna</hi> near a Town call'd <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardina,</hi> where no doubt the <hi>Bergameſe</hi> had been utterly ruin'd, if <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leatius</hi> had been there; but he was gone to <hi>Florence</hi> a little before, to ſettle matters relating to the War. Thoſe that were preſent at this Battel ſay, that it was fought with the greateſt obſtinacy and the moſt nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſlaughters of any in our Age. But now the <hi>Venetians</hi> bethink themſelves for their own ſafety, rather than that of the <hi>Bergameſe,</hi> and though they ſent ſome Forces to his aſſiſtance, yet they ſought earneſtly a Peace, and referr'd the whole matter to the Pope; who alſo lying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great apprehenſions, if the King of <hi>Naples</hi> and Duke of <hi>Millain</hi> ſhould obtain a compleat Victory, urg'd on the Peace too. It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Opinion of many Men of Underſtanding, that the Pope was not altogether againſt <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Deſign, knowing that if an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were made in the Government of <hi>Florence,</hi> he might with greater facility make War upon <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> whom he ſo hated, that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to raiſe him up more Enemies in <hi>Italy.</hi> Having hereupon called together the Embaſſadours of the ſeveral Princes, he mediated a Peace upon theſe terms, That each Party ſhould reſtore what they had taken in the War, That <hi>Bartholomew</hi> ſhould retire with his Forces into <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> and That for the reſt the Conditions of that Peace ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, which had been made at <hi>Lodi</hi> between <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> and the <hi>Venetians.</hi> One Point was yet to be Diſputed, Whether the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and his Brother <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould be included in this Peace, who that year taking pay of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> had ravag'd <hi>Galeatius</hi>'s Country with their Forces. <hi>Galeatius</hi> denied to yield to it, profeſſing no Man ſhould ever be his Ally and Friend, who was an Enemy to the King of <hi>France.</hi>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:50681:223"/>
But <hi>Paul</hi> with Promiſes and fair words made ſhift to get <hi>Galeatius</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to ſign it contrary to his Maſter's order, which ſo enrag'd <hi>Galea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> that he baniſh'd the ſaid Embaſſador, <hi>Lorenzo da Peſaro,</hi> and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> that they were forced to ſue for Peace, which by the interceſſion of the Queen of <hi>France</hi> and Ducheſs of <hi>Milan,</hi> both Siſters to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> they at laſt procur'd, upon conditions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the King of <hi>France.</hi> Affairs thus ſetled, <hi>Paul</hi> had a little lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and inſtituted ſumptuous Plays, and made noble Feaſts after the ancient manner for the people of <hi>Rome, Vianeſius</hi> of <hi>Bologna,</hi> Vice-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain to his Holineſs taking care of them. He propoſed eight Cloaks to be run for each day in the <hi>Carneval</hi>; old Men, middle-ag'd, young Men, nay <hi>Jews,</hi> took their fortune in the Races, as alſo did even Horſes, Mares, Aſſes, Buffals, to the incredible pleaſure of the Spectators. The Race was from <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Arch to St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church, where the Pope himſelf ſtood to behold it with great ſatisfaction; who after the ſport was over gave to every Boy that ran (daub'd all over with Dirt) a Carlin [a piece of Money]. But <hi>Paul</hi> amidſt all this publick Jollity was on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſeiz'd with a terrour unexpected; for news was brought him, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral young Men, whoſe Ring-leader was one <hi>Callimaco,</hi> had form'd a Plot againſt him; and the Narrative of it was no ſooner made out to him, when (he being already almoſt dead with fear) comes a Fellow that call'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> a ſad Wretch and a baniſh'd Man, who (firſt begging pardon for his life and liberty to live in his Country) ſhams a Story upon him, that he ſaw in the Wood of <hi>Velitre,</hi> one <hi>Luca Tozzo,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> but baniſh'd, with a great number of other <hi>Banditi,</hi> and that they were juſt coming upon him. This made <hi>Paul</hi> tremble for fear, apprehending that now, being attack'd both without and within, he ſhould ſurely be undone: and therefore he clapt up a great many both Citizens and Courtiers. <hi>Vianeſius</hi> gave him occaſions of fear, and ſo did any one about him who from a turn of Affairs could probably expect an augmentation either of Dignity or Eſtate. They broke up Mens Houſes without diſtinction, and drag'd to Priſon any body they ſuſpected, and leſt I ſhould have miſs'd my ſhare in ſo great a calamity, they came by Night and ſet a Guard about my Houſe, broke open the Windows and Doors, and ſeiz'd my Servant <hi>Demetrius</hi> a <hi>Luccheſe,</hi> who told them I ſup'd that Night with the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi>; hither then they fly and taking me in his Chamber, they bring me before <hi>Paul,</hi> who as ſoon as he ſaw me, <hi>Are you too</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in the Plot with</hi> Callimaco <hi>againſt me?</hi> But I, conſcious of my Innocence, anſwer'd him ſo fearleſly, that no ſign of guilt appear'd in me. He being negligently dreſt and looking pale urg'd me ſtill, and ſometimes threatned me with Torments and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Death, unleſs I would confeſs.
<q>I ſeeing all places full of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and tumults, and fearing leſt we ſhould ſuffer miſchief, by reaſon of the terrour and rage that I ſaw had poſſeſs'd them, ſhew'd many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why I could not believe <hi>Callimaco</hi> would attempt nor ſo much as to think of any ſuch Deſign, being without cunning, an ill ſpeaker, unactive, regardleſs, without Wealth, wanting Forces, Dependents, Ammunition, and beſide being almoſt blind; more drowſie than P. <hi>Lentulus</hi> and more unfit for action, by means of his corpulence, than <hi>L. Craſſus.</hi> Moreover, he was no Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he ſhould concern himſelf for the liberty of his Country; nor was he a Prelate
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:50681:224"/>
that upon the taking off of <hi>Paul,</hi> he ſhould expect the Papacy. What could <hi>Callimaco</hi> do? What dare he do? Was he good either at Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe or Action? Had he liſted any Men to aſſiſt him in bringing about ſo important a Deſign; unleſs you will make <hi>Glaucus</hi> and <hi>Petreius,</hi> the Companions of his flight, to be other <hi>Gabinii</hi> and <hi>Statilii.</hi>
                  </q>
At this <hi>Paul</hi> turns him to <hi>Vianeſius,</hi> and looking ſternly upon me, (ſays he) this Man is to be forced with the Rack to confeſs the truth; for he underſtands the true Art of Plotting. Would to God <hi>Paul</hi> had dealt more conſiderately with me, he had not then applyed tortures to me. For when the Truth is to be gathered from circumſtances, the matter of fact not being ſufficiently made out, then thoſe Actions are to be taken notice of that either preceded or enſued upon the Enterpriſe; the life of the Complotter is to be conſidered and his way of living, his Ambition and greedineſs, either of wealth or honour, and what he had before talk'd or written or done, that look'd that way, But <hi>Paul</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard had to any of theſe, clap'd us all up in Jail: and yet taking advice of ſome who knew the thing well enough and knew that <hi>Luca Tozzo</hi> had never departed a foot from the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> to create ſo great a commotion with ſuch danger to himſelf, he recall'd a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had publiſhed three days before, wherein he had propoſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to them that ſhould bring his Traitor <hi>Luca</hi> to him either alive or dead, not diſcharging however the <hi>Quadratii,</hi> whom he had ſeiz'd and tortur'd upon ſuſpicion of the ſame. He deſign'd it ſhould be thought that there was ſomething in it yet undiſcover'd, leſt he ſhould be charg'd with levity. But <hi>Paul</hi> being rid of that fear, begins to think of us; and ſends into the Caſtle <hi>Vianeſius, John Franciſco, Sanga</hi> of <hi>Chiozza</hi> and one of his Guard, to force us with any kind of torture to confeſs what we knew nothing of. The firſt and ſecond day many were put to the Rack, of whom a great part died of their pains under the hands of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. You would have taken Caſtle St. <hi>Angelo</hi> for <hi>Phalaris</hi> his Bull, the hollow Vault did ſo reſound with the cries of thoſe miſerable young Men. <hi>Lucidus</hi> as innocent a Man as any in the World ſuffer'd the Rack, as did <hi>Marſus Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Auguſtinus Campanus</hi> a hopeful young Man and an honour to his Age for Wit and Learning, who I think died ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of pain and anguiſh. The Tormenters were yet not ſatisfied, though weary, having tortur'd twenty Men in thoſe two days, but ſent for me to take my turn too. The Executioners ſet themſelves to their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Inſtruments of Torture were ready, I was ſtript, torn and uſed like a Murtherer or a Thief; whilſt <hi>Vianeſius</hi> ſat like another <hi>Minos</hi> upon a Tapeſtry-Seat, as if he had been at a Wedding or rather at <hi>Atreus</hi> and <hi>Tantalus</hi>'s Feaſt; a Man (I ſay) in Holy Orders whom the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Canons forbid to be Inquiſitors by Torture upon Lay men, leſt if Death follow, as it often does, they ſhould become Irregular (as they term it) and profane. And to add to my miſery, while wretched I hung on the Rack in torment, he play'd with a Jewel that <hi>Sanga</hi> had, asking him of what Girl he had got that Love-token; and then the Love-talk being over, he turns to me and bids me give him a full Narrative of the Conſpiracy or rather Sham-Plot contrived by <hi>Callimaco,</hi> and to tell him why <hi>Pomponio</hi> writing to me from <hi>Venice</hi> ſhould call me Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? What, ſays he, the Conſpirators had agreed to make you Pope! Beſide he examin'd me whether I had not ſent Letters by <hi>Pomponio</hi> to the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:50681:224"/>
Emperor or any other Chriſtian Prince in order to raiſe a Schiſm or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a Council? I anſwer'd that I never was a party in the Counſels of <hi>Callimaco,</hi> for there was an old grudg between us; that I knew not why <hi>Pomponio</hi> ſhould call me Holy Father, himſelf could beſt tell, who, he ſaid, was to be brought Priſoner quickly; as for the Popedom, they need not trouble their heads about me, I having been always content with a private life; that I never ſent any Letter to the Emperor, or made uſe of <hi>Pomponio</hi> to that purpoſe, which alſo might be known from him. At laſt having a little pleaſed but not ſatisfied himſelf with my Tortures, he ordered me to be let down, that I might undergo torments much greater in the Evening. I was carried half dead into my Chamber, but not long after, the Inquiſitors having din'd, and drunk luſtily, I was fetch'd again, and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Spalato</hi> was there. They ask'd me then what diſcourſe it was that I had with <hi>Sigiſmund Malateſta</hi> who was then in the City? I ſaid, the diſcourſe we had was onely concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient and modern Learning, way of fighting, and famous Men, or ſuch like things as are the common ſubjects of talk. <hi>Vianeſius</hi> then threatned me bitterly with yet greater tortures, unleſs I would confeſs the truth, and told me he was to come again the next day, adviſing me in the mean time to conſider where I was and whom I had to do withal. So I was carried back to my Bed-chamber, where I was ſeized with ſuch extream pain, that I had rather have died than endur'd, all the aches of my ſhaken and batter'd limbs coming afreſh upon me. But I was not a little refreſh'd by the kindneſs of <hi>Angelo Bufalo</hi> a Knight of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had been committed to Priſon a year before by <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe his Son <hi>Marcellus</hi> had killed <hi>Francis Cappocio,</hi> which was charged to be done by his inſtigation. This <hi>Angelo</hi> and his Nephew <hi>Francis</hi> being my Chamber-fellows did with their own hands aſſiſt me both with Food and Phyſic, otherwiſe I had died of pain and want: Two days after <hi>Paul</hi>'s Phyſician, <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> of <hi>Verona,</hi> came to me from the Pope and bad me have a good heart and hope well of him, and I ſhould ſoon have my liberty. I asked him in how long time it might be expected? Nay (ſays he frankly in the hearing of every one) not ſo very ſoon neither; leſt the Pope ſhould be charg'd with levity and cruelty for having with ſo much noiſe taken and tortur'd ſo many Men and then letting them go immediately as innocent. But <hi>Paul</hi> left not the matter ſo, but altering his mind upon a running report, accuſes thoſe now of Hereſie whom he had before charged with Plotting of Treaſon. <hi>Pomponio</hi> was at this time brought from <hi>Venice</hi> like another <hi>Jugurtha,</hi> in bonds to be tried, a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right honeſt Man and guilty neither of the Plot nor any other ill thing. Being examined why he changed the names of the Men he wrote to, he anſwer'd boldly as his humour was, that it did not concern either his Judges or the Pope, under what name he pleaſed to go, ſo that he had no naughty end in it; for that out of reſpect to Antiquity he was wont to make uſe of many antient names, as ſpurs to egg on the modern Youth to a virtuous Emulation. <hi>Lucillus</hi> alſo who led a very reſerv'd life in the Country near <hi>Rome,</hi> was fetch'd up before them for Treaſon, becauſe in a Letter of his to <hi>Campanus</hi> which they had intercepted, he had faln foul upon ſome body, under the name of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> for his Love-tricks, but with ſuch conceal'd expreſſions, that no one who was not conſcious would take it to himſelf. Our diligent Paſtor, <hi>Vianeſius,</hi> frequently vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:50681:225"/>
us with tortures, and having tormented <hi>Petreius</hi> the Companion of <hi>Callimaco</hi> (whom they had taken endeavouring to make his eſcape, and he confeſſing nothing, but ſaying that the drunken talk of <hi>Callimaco</hi> was not to be regarded) caſting his eyes about as if he fear'd we ſhould have got Wings like <hi>Daedalus</hi> and fled out of our Priſon, he projected the making a dungeon for us and ſet Workmen about it. When it was finiſhed he put into it <hi>Franciſco Anguillara, Gattaluſco, Franciſco Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viano,</hi> and <hi>Giaiomo Ptolemeo</hi> who had already pin'd away four years in Priſon. But not a word yet could we hear of our freedom. At this time the Emperor came to <hi>Rome,</hi> (according to a Vow he had made) with a ſplendid Attendance, whom <hi>Paul</hi> entertain'd with great magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, at the expence of eighteen thouſand Ducats. I ſaw them from the Caſtle returning under the ſame Canopy from the <hi>Lateran</hi> with a noble retinue; and <hi>Paul</hi> ſtood ſtill upon the Bridg, while the Emperor made ſeveral Knights. The Emperor departing, and <hi>Paul</hi> by having quarter'd the greateſt part of his Forces both Horſe and Foot in the City, being rid of the fear he had leſt the People ſhould have raiſed tumults upon him when the Emperor was there, after we had lain ten months in Jail, he comes to the Caſtle himſelf, and that it might ſeem, that he made ſo great ado not without cauſe, he charged us with many things, but eſpecially that we had diſputed concerning the Immortality of the Soul, and that we held the Opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> which S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſays is very like to the Chriſtian Faith. 'Tis with good reaſon (ſays the Saint) that <hi>Cicero</hi> makes <hi>Plato</hi> a God among the Philoſophers, who certainly out-went them all for Wit and Underſtanding: and with him therefore I choſe to diſpute, becauſe he reaſons concerning the laſt end of Man and the Divine Nature better than any of the reſt. But, ſays <hi>Paul,</hi> By diſputing you call'd the Being of a God into queſtion. Now this was no more than may be objected to all both Divines and Philoſophers of our times, who for Diſcourſe-ſake and that the truth may appear, do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make a queſtion of the beings of Souls and of God and of all ſeparate Intelligences. Beſides, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, thoſe are Heretics, who defend with earneſtneſs any falſe Opinion they have taken up. We ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver declin'd ſound Diſcipline, which (as <hi>Leo</hi> ſays) is wont to be done by the Ringleaders of Error, who are deſervedly called Heretics, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> for maintaining Opinions in oppoſition to the Church. I could give you an Account of my Life from my youth till this time, ever ſince I came to years of underſtanding. No ill action can be charg'd upon me, no theft, no pilfering, no ſacriledg, no cheat upon the publick, no murther, no rapine, nor Simony. I have lived like a Chriſtian, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd and receiv'd the Communion at leaſt once a year. Nothing ever fell from my mouth againſt the Faith or reliſhing of Hereſie. I follow'd neither <hi>Simoniacs,</hi> the <hi>Carpocratiani, Ophilae, Severiani, Alogii, Paulini, Manichees, Macedoniani,</hi> nor any other heretical faction. But beſide, <hi>Paul</hi> accuſed us as too great admirers of Pagan Antiquities, of which no Man could be more fond than himſelf, for he procur'd all the Statues of the Antients that he could throughout the City, and plac'd them in his Houſe which he had built near the <hi>Campidoglio</hi>; among the reſt he took away a Porphyry Tomb of S. <hi>Conſtantia</hi> out of the Church of S. <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> maugre the denial of the Monks of the place, who yet after <hi>Paul</hi>'s death, got it again of Pope <hi>Sixtus.</hi> Beſide, after the old Heathen way,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:50681:225"/>
he coin'd an infinite number of Medals with his own Image, of Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Braſs, and laid them in the foundations of his Houſe; herein imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating rather the antient <hi>Paynims,</hi> than S. <hi>Peter, Anacletus</hi> or <hi>Linus.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a debate of our matter before the Court-Biſhops and two Friers, one a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> the other a <hi>Dominican,</hi> they agreed all, that nothing could be charged upon us that ſavour'd of Hereſie. But <hi>Paul</hi> coming to the Caſtle, and having on purpoſe excluded <hi>Franciſco</hi> who favour'd us, that ſo <hi>Leonardo</hi> our Accuſer, might ſpeak the more freely, he repeated what he had ſaid the day but one before; and then ask'd the Opinion of thoſe that were preſent, who though they ſpoke ſomewhat to pleaſe the Pope, yet they made a light buſineſs of it, and endeavour'd to perſuade him into a milder temper. Amongſt them all <hi>Lelio del Val,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> and an Advocate in the Conſiſtory, defended our Cauſe very generouſly. He confuted all that <hi>Leonard</hi> had ſaid and what the other Advocate had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted; but as they were arguing, mention chanc'd to be made of the <hi>Academy,</hi> which was no ſooner ſaid, but <hi>M. Barbo</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> cries out that we were not <hi>Academicks</hi> but a ſcandal to the name. Now I cannot think how we ſhould bring any reproach to it at all: we were neither thieves, nor pilferers, nor incendiaries, nor prodigal fools; we were ſectators of the old <hi>Academy,</hi> deſpiſing the new as eſtabliſhing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certain upon which Science might be built; but <hi>Paul</hi> would not have the <hi>Academy</hi> ſo much as mention'd under pain of being pronounc'd Heretical, which was a reflection upon good old <hi>Plato</hi> and let him look to it. <hi>Paul</hi> lov'd in every kind of learning to be thought an acute and skilful Man; he deſir'd too to go for a facetious Perſon, ſo that he derided and contemn'd almoſt all Men. He after a ſcornful manner ask'd <hi>Pomponio,</hi> what was the name his Parents gave him? who anſwer'd he was <hi>Binomius</hi> [i.e. had two names] which <hi>Paul</hi> not underſtanding, perſiſted to ask his name ſtill. At laſt turning to me, he fell into a rage to ſuch a degree that, beſide charging me with the Plot, Hereſie and Treaſon, of which I had cleared my ſelf; he upbraided me too with Ingratitude againſt ſo kind a Friend as he had been to me: If it be a kindneſs for a Man to be turn'd out of that which he has bought with his Mony without telling any reaſon; if to be impriſon'd, tormented, diſgrac'd and ſlander'd be a kindneſs, then <hi>Paul</hi> was my ſpecial bountiful Friend, and I was very ungrateful, who unmindful of ſuch Courteſies, did not depart the City in obedience to his command, when I had been ſo often deceiv'd by his Promiſes. He went away threatning us and kept us in Priſon a whole year as I believe he had ſworn he would, when he took us firſt and clap'd us up; and he was not willing to ſeem forſworn. At length how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we were enlarg'd ſo far as to have the liberty of his own Houſe, but not to ſtir a foot out of it; and ſoon after we had the freedom of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and in the end, being wearied with the Interceſſions of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, he ſet us free. Not long after I was ſent for by <hi>Lewis Gonzaga</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to the Baths, in order to cure my right Arm which had contracted a great indiſpoſition during my impriſonment; which <hi>Paul</hi> forbad me at firſt to do; promiſing to do great things for me in a little time; but I went and return'd, Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion</hi> a Perſon of great wit, and learning, being Security for my coming back. <hi>Paul</hi> commended me that I was as good as my word, and would often boaſt what a kindneſs he had for me, and what great things he would do for me as ſoon as
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:50681:226"/>
                  <hi>Borſius d' Eſte</hi> was gone, who coming to the City with a great Equipage was very magnificently and ſplendidly received by him. The ſame he had often promiſed to the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> who had ſpoken on my behalf. For two years I was led on or rather beguil'd with theſe hopes, till at length I reſolv'd to go with the Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> to <hi>Bononia,</hi> of which he was Legat. But <hi>Paul</hi> forbad me, and (after his jeſting manner) ſaid I had wit enough already, and wanted Wealth rather than Learning. And now while I was in expectation that I ſhould be reliev'd after ſo many troubles and afflictions, behold the Pope dies of an Apoplexy about two hours within night, being alone in his Chamber, having been well that day and held a Conſiſtory. His death happened <hi>July</hi> 28. 1471. in the ſixth year and tenth month of his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate. As to his Perſonage, it was Majeſtic and becoming a Pope; for he was ſo portly and tall, that he was eaſily diſtinguiſhable from the reſt, when at Maſs; In his dreſs though he was not curious yet he was not reputed negligent. Nay, 'tis ſaid that when he was to appear in public, he would uſe to paint his face. In his Pontifical Veſtments he outwent all his Predeceſſors, eſpecially in his <hi>Regno</hi> or Mitre, upon which he laid out a great deal of Mony in purchaſing at vaſt rates, Diamonds, Sapphyrs, Emeralds, Chryſoliths, Jaſpers, Unions, and all manner of precious ſtones, wherewith adorn'd like another <hi>Aaron</hi> he would appear abroad ſomewhat more auguſt than a Man, delighting to be ſeen and admir'd by every one. To this purpoſe ſometimes by deferring ſome uſual Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities he would keep Strangers in Town, that ſo he might be view'd by greater numbers. But leſt he alone ſhould ſeem to differ from the reſt, he made a Decree that none but Cardinals, ſhould under a Penalty wear red Caps; to whom he had in the firſt year of his Popedom given Cloth of that colour, to make Horſe-Cloths or Mule-Cloths of when they rode. He was alſo about to order that Cardinals Caps ſhould be of Silk Scarlet; but ſome Perſons hindred it by telling him well, that the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Pomp was rather to be diminiſhed than encreaſed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of the Chriſtian Religion. Before he was made Pope, he uſed to give out, that if ever he came to that good fortune, he would give each Cardinal a Caſtle in the Country where they might retire conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently to avoid the Summer-heats of the City: but when he was once got into the Chair, he thought of nothing leſs. However, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by his Authority and by force too to augment the Power of the Papacy: For he ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Tricarico</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to hear the Cauſe of quarrel between the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and the People of <hi>Liege,</hi> and upon their reconciliation, to take off the Interdict laid upon the <hi>Lie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geois</hi> for wrongfully expelling their Biſhop; but while the Legat took great pains to ſubject all matters to the Pope's Judgment, he and their Biſhop too were clapt up by the <hi>Liegeois.</hi> Hereupon the Duke of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> makes Peace with the <hi>French</hi> King (with whom he was before at War) and with his aid, gives thoſe of <hi>Liege</hi> ſeveral great defeats and at length ſacks their City and ſets free the impriſon'd Biſhops: Moreover, <hi>Paul</hi> hearing of the Apoſtaſie of the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> he by his Legat, <hi>Lorenzo Roverella</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> raiſed the <hi>Hungarians</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> upon him, ſo that he had certainly cut off both the King <hi>George</hi> and his Progeny, and utterly rooted out the Heretics, had not the <hi>Polanders,</hi> who laid claim to that Kingdom, held <hi>Matthias</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> employ'd
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:50681:226"/>
in War, leſt he ſhould have made himſelf Maſter of it. He undertook two Wars of no great moment in <hi>Italy,</hi> which being not openly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but begun by picqueering Parties, he afterwards abandon'd. For firſt he attempted the ſeizing the Signeury of <hi>Tolfa</hi> by cunning wiles, which failing, with open force, under the conduct of <hi>Vianeſius</hi> he ſet upon it and beſieged it; but the King's Army (in which the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> ſerv'd) returning from the War they had now ended with <hi>Bartholomew</hi> of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo,</hi> on a ſudden he raiſed the Siege in great diſorder, though the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was not within ſixty miles of the place; ſo that after a long conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which he had extreamly diſobliged and almoſt enrag'd the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> againſt him, he was fain to purchaſe <hi>Tolfa</hi> for ſeventeen thouſand Ducats of Gold, for fear of that potent Family who were related to the Lords of the place. After the ſame manner he ſet upon <hi>Robert Malateſta</hi> Son of <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> when having taken the Suburbs of <hi>Rimini</hi> by a Stratagem, and for ſometime having beſieged the City, <hi>Lorenzo</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lato</hi> being the chief in the Enterpriſe, <hi>Frederick</hi> D. of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> came upon him with the King's Forces and thoſe of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who forc'd him to raiſe his Siege, and foil'd his Army ſhamefully, ſo that he accepted of a Peace upon very diſhonourable terms. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> charg'd the reaſon of the loſs of <hi>Rimini</hi> upon the niggardlineſs of his pay to the Soldiers; and to the great ſlowneſs of his Reſolution, while through ignorance in affairs of that nature, he deliberated long about actions which ſhould be done in a moment. <hi>Paul</hi> was indeed ſo awkward at buſineſs, that, except he were driven to it, he would not enter upon any Affair however plain and unencumbred, nor when begun would he bring it to peofection. This humour of his, he was wont to boaſt, had done him great ſervice in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny concerns, whereas (to ſpeak truth) it had been very miſchievous both to himſelf and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He yet was very diligent in getting Mony, ſo that he generally intruſted the diſpoſal of Biſhopricks and Benefices to ſuch Courtiers, whoſe Places being ſaleable, nothing could be beſtowed without a Preſent. All Offices indeed in his time were ſet to ſale, whereby it came to paſs, that he who had a mind to a Biſhoprick or Benefice, would purchaſe of him at a good rate ſome other Office, and ſo get what he would have, in ſpight of any other Candidates, who could pretend upon the ſcore of either Learning or good Life to be capable of whatſoever honour or preferment. Beſide when Biſhopricks were vacant, he would remove the more worthy (as he call'd them) to the more wealthy Seat, by theſe Tranſlations raiſing vaſt Sums of Mony, becauſe more Annates became due at the ſame time. He alſo allow'd the purchaſing of Salaries. With theſe Moneys he would ſometimes be very liberal, giving exhibitions to the poorer Cardinals and Biſhops, and to Princes or Noblemen that were driven out of their Country, and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving poor Maidens, Widows and ſick People. He took great care too, that Corn and all manner of Victuals ſhould be afforded cheaper at <hi>Rome</hi> than formerly. He was at the charge of ſeveral magnificent Buildings near Saint <hi>Mark</hi>'s and in the <hi>Vatican.</hi> An inſtance of his Munificence was, the Hunting which with great charge he cauſed to be repreſented in the <hi>Campo di Merula,</hi> for the entertainment of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> The management of which was committed to his Nephew by his Siſter, whom he had made Cardinal of S. <hi>Lucia,</hi> and at the ſame time conferred the like honour of a Cardinal on <hi>Baptiſta Zeno</hi> his other Nephew.

was a hard thing to gain acceſs to him, conſidering he would ſleep in the day-time and be awake in the night looking over his Jewels and pretious Stones; and if after long waiting you came into his preſence, you might hear him indeed, but your ſelf could not be heard; he was ſo very talkative. He was moroſe and peeviſh as well to his Courtiers as Strangers, and would often alter his mind from what he had promiſed. He had a great mind to be thought a politick Man, and would therefore give very ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous anſwers; ſo that he continued not long his Friendſhips with any Princes or Commonwealths, himſelf having ſeveral different Intereſts. He lov'd to have great variety of Diſhes at his Table, and generally eat of the worſt; but would be clamorous if what he uſed to like were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. He drank often, but his Wine was ſmall and diluted with Water. He loved Melons, Crabs, Sweetmeats, Fiſh and Bacon; which odd kind of Diet, I believe, cauſed the Apoplexy of which he died; for the day before his death he had eat two very large Melons. He was reputed a juſt and yet a merciful Man; endeavouring to amend even Thieves, Murderers, Traitors and perjur'd Villains, by tedious Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment. But he was a great Enemy and Deſpiſer of Human Learning, branding thoſe for Heretics that gave their minds to it: and diſſuading the People of <hi>Rome</hi> from putting their Children to be brought up to it, telling them that it was enough if they had learn'd to write and read. He was known to be ill-condition'd and inexorable to Petitioners, not onely denying, but reproaching and abuſing them; but yet he would make a ſhow of doing leſs than he would do. Laſtly, one thing he was highly to be commended for, that he kept no ill Men about him; but contain'd his Family and all his Domeſtics in their due bounds; that their pride and inſolence might not procure him the hate of the great Men and People of <hi>Rome.</hi>

His Fathers name was <hi>Leonard,</hi> a perſon of Authority and Reputation, having managed many publick Offices for the Service of his Country. This <hi>Francis della Rovere</hi> was in the time of his infancy dedicated by the Vow of his Mother to the Order of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> and at the age of nine years was put into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and committed to the charge of <hi>John Pinarolo</hi> a Frier of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; by whom he was inſtructed in the Rules of the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and in the firſt Rudiments of Grammar: and being of good Wit and Capacity, he became Maſter of the <hi>Ciceronian</hi> Stile and Language. He afterwards went to <hi>Cheri,</hi> where he ſtudied Logick, and thence tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to <hi>Pavia</hi> and <hi>Bologna,</hi> where he became a great proficient in Philoſophy and Divinity. Being of twenty years of age, he diſputed with great acuteneſs and ſubtilty in the Schools at <hi>Geneva</hi>; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taking the degree of Doctor in <hi>Padua</hi> he was made Reader of the Divinity and Philoſophy Lectures at <hi>Padoua, Pavia, Siena,</hi> and other parts in <hi>Italy.</hi> In proceſs of time his abilities being made known, he was eſteemed and courted by all; and having many Scholars and admirers, amongſt which Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion</hi> was one, he gained a great eſteem and intereſt in all Courts of Europe; ſo that in time he was conſtituted Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of his Order, Procurator of the Court at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Vicar-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of all <hi>Italy.</hi> He was highly eſteemed by <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Paul</hi> the ſecond being a great admirer of his abilities and Learning, did at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and perſuaſion of the Cardinals <hi>Beſſarion</hi> and <hi>Francis de Gonzaga,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him, with ſeven others to the order of Cardinals, without any motion In proceſs of time his abilities being made known, he was eſteemed and courted by all; and having many Scholars and admirers, amongſt which Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion</hi> was one, he gained a great eſteem and intereſt in all Courts of Europe; ſo that in time he was conſtituted Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of his Order, Procurator of the Court at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Vicar-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of all <hi>Italy.</hi> He was highly eſteemed by <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Paul</hi> the ſecond being a great admirer of his abilities and Learning, did at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and perſuaſion of the Cardinals <hi>Beſſarion</hi> and <hi>Francis de Gonzaga,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him, with ſeven others to the order of Cardinals, without any motion

or addreſs from himſelf, or ſo much as his own knowledg, being then at <hi>Pavia,</hi> with deſign to go for <hi>Venice.</hi> On this occaſion coming to <hi>Rome</hi> he was created Cardinal the 17th. of <hi>September,</hi> 1467. and being by the beneficence, and favour of the Church aſſiſted with many large Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, he was enabled to repair the Palace of S. <hi>Peter ad Vincola,</hi> where he formed, and kept his Court after the Rules and Cuſtoms of a Convent. The exerciſe of this eminent Office, and his attendance on the Government of the Church, could not ſo diſtract, or divert his mind from his Studies; but that he found time to write many Tractates, and Treatiſes in Divinity, namely, a Tract of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; of the Conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary, de futuris contingentibus</hi>; and of the Power of God, againſt the Opinion of a certain Carmelite Frier, who held, that God could not by his Omnipotent Power, ſave any perſon whom he had predeſtinated to damnation. He alſo wrote a Tractate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the opinions of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Scotus,</hi> ſhewing that they did not differ in ſubſtance, or reallity, but in words, or ways of expreſſion. All which procured him ſuch fame and credit, that <hi>Paul</hi> the ſecond dying ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly on the 28th. of <hi>July,</hi> he was in a Conclave of ſeven and twenty Cardinals elected Pope on the 9th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1471.</p>
               <p>After his Election he was Crowned the 24th. of <hi>September</hi> following, after which he eſteemed it his firſt buſineſs to reconcile the Diſcords amongſt Chriſtian Princes, and to turn the hatred they conceived one againſt the other, upon their common enemy the Turk. To which end <hi>Beſſarion</hi> was Commiſſionated to be his Legat to <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. of <hi>France, Roderigo Borgia</hi> Vice-Chancellor to go his Legat into <hi>Spain, Marco Barbo</hi> into <hi>Germany.</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Oliviere Carafa</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Knights of <hi>Rhodes</hi>; to every of which Legats he aſſigned a Penſion of 500 Crowns in Gold <hi>per</hi> Month, but the ſucceſs anſwered not the charge, all the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats returning without any effect, or fruit of their Negotiations. For <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11th. had already levied War againſt <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Brittany. Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Aragon</hi> made War on the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to decide the diſpute between them for the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> The Kings of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> were in actual Wars, fighting for the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi>; ſo that the Oratorical perſuaſions of theſe Miniſters of Peace, were not able to prevail on the incenſed, and reſolved minds of theſe warlike Princes. And being now fixed and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in his Apoſtolical Seat, he received with a ſerenity of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and chearful affability, the Addreſſes and Congratulations which Forein Princes by their reſpective Miniſters made to him at his firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion to the Papal Dignity: which Ceremony being performed, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and declared two perſons to be by him created Cardinals, namely, <hi>Peter Riario,</hi> and <hi>Julian della Rovere</hi>; the firſt was of a mean Family at <hi>Savona,</hi> and educated by this <hi>Sixtus</hi> in the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Order, and made Biſhop of <hi>Treviſi:</hi> The other was Son of his Brother <hi>Raphael della Rovere,</hi> whom he had conſtituted Biſhop of <hi>Carpentras.</hi> The firſt took the Title of S. <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and the other of S. <hi>Peter ad Vincola,</hi> who was afterwards Pope <hi>Julian</hi> the ſecond.</p>
               <p>And ſuch was the affection which this Pope indulged to his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Relations, that he never refuſed to grant their demands, or yield to the moſt exorbitant of their deſires; for which he was much blamed, and hardly cenſured, with many reflections on his conduct and wiſdom:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50681:228"/>
for he had enriched this <hi>Peter Riario</hi> with ſeveral fat Benefices, on the Revenue of which he might have lived with ſplendor, and greatneſs. But ſo exorbitant were his expences, that in the ſpace of two years only he ſpent two hundred thouſand Crowns of Gold, leaving a debt of ſeventy thouſand Crowns, with three hundred pounds weight of wrought Plate; and then being diſcontented with diſappointments of his ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, he died at 28 years of age, and was buried in the Church of the holy Apoſtles. His Brother <hi>Jeronimo,</hi> tho (as we have ſaid) of mean ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, was yet by the favour of this Pope made Prince of <hi>Imola,</hi> and <hi>Forli,</hi> and married to <hi>Catherine</hi> natural Daughter of <hi>Galeazzo</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan:</hi> and on this account and reaſon <hi>Aſcanius</hi> the Son of <hi>Galeazzo</hi> was created Cardinal. And farther did the affection of this Pope extend to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Nephews, and Relations, that he married <hi>Leonard</hi> his Brothers Son to the natural Daughter of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and ordained him Governor of <hi>Rome:</hi> and he dying ſoon after, his place was beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>John</hi> the Brother of Cardinal <hi>Julian,</hi> with augmentation of the Signiories of <hi>Sora</hi> and <hi>Senegaglia</hi>; on the reputation of which he married <hi>Jane</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> by whom he had one Son called <hi>Franciſco Maria,</hi> who ſucceeded in the Dukedom of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Uncle <hi>Guy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bald,</hi> who died without iſſue. This Pope moreover created his Brother <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> and <hi>Domenico della Rovere</hi> Cardinals, as alſo <hi>Jeronimo Baſſo</hi> his Siſters Son, <hi>Raphael Sanſon,</hi> a youth of 17 years of age, Son of his Siſter the Wife of <hi>Peter Riario,</hi> alſo <hi>Schiafinato</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> who was his Chancellor, and Biſhop of <hi>Parma</hi>; likewiſe <hi>John Baptiſta Cibo</hi> of <hi>Genoua,</hi> who afterwards ſuccceeded in the Popedom, under the name of <hi>Innocent</hi> VIII: and beſides theſe he raiſed many others to the number of 34, whom he ſucceſſively created Cardinals during his Reign.</p>
               <p>And ſo free and liberal was <hi>Sixtus</hi> in his Promotions and Gifts, that nothing was asked of him which he denied; which liberality gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion oftentimes to many Diſputes, when the free nature of the Pope had given Donations to three or four perſons of the ſame thing: to prevent which for the future, the Privy Signet was given to <hi>John de Montemira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> a ſevere and reſerved perſon, and one well practiſed in the Affairs of the Court, who keeping an account of all matters which had paſſed the Seal, vacated ſuch Donations as were not regularly granted.</p>
               <p>It is doubtful amongſt the Writers of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, whether it was this Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> the Second, that reduced the year of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile to 25; howſoever it is certain, that this Pope in the year 1475. did Celebrate the Jubile, which brought a great concourſe of people to <hi>Rome,</hi> amongſt which were ſeveral Kings and Princes preſent, ſuch as the Kings of <hi>Denmark, Sweden</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> of <hi>Boſna</hi> and <hi>Walachia,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Calabria</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> with many others of great Quality, who in perſon made their Pilgrimages to <hi>Rome</hi> to gain the Indulgences, Pardons, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges which were granted at that Solemnity.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Mathias</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> being deſirous to create an Alliance between himſelf and <hi>Caſimir</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> did in the year 1476. make demand of his Daughter in Marriage; but before <hi>Caſimir</hi> would aſſent thereunto, he ſent his Son <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi> to <hi>Frederick</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror then at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to deſire that he might be eſtabliſhed and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the right of the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> notwithſtanding that it had formerly been given away by <hi>Paul</hi> the Second to <hi>Mathias</hi> King of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50681:229"/>
                  <hi>Hungary.</hi> On which Quarrel the Knights of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order did not only at the inſtigation of <hi>Balthaſar</hi> the Popes Legat make War againſt the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> with aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>Hungary</hi>; but likewiſe the Legat Excommunicated <hi>Vladiſlaus</hi> the new King of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> and his Father <hi>Caſimir,</hi> upon pretence that they favoured the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the <note n="*" place="margin">John Huz.</note> 
                  <hi>Huſſites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That long continued Difference and Diſpute between the Secular Prieſts and the Mendicant Friers, which had laſted for above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, was afterwards by the Sentence of this Pope determined in this manner,
<q>That the Seculars ſhould never hereafter tax, or impeach the Mendicants as Authors of Hereſie, but honor and reſpect them, as thoſe, by whoſe Preaching the truth of the Goſpel had been greatly enlightned. That all Communicants ſhould be obliged to hear Maſs ſaid by their Parochial Prieſts, every Sunday, and ſolemn Feſtival, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the Mendicants were not admitted to Preach. That the Mendicants ſhould not declare the people diſobliged from making their Confeſſions to their Parochial Prieſt, at leaſt every Eaſter, according as they are directed by the Eccleſiaſtical Canons; provided ſtill that the Mendicants retain their Privilege of hearing Confeſſions, and enjoyning Penance.</q>
Theſe, and ſome other particulars being declared, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by this Pope, the animoſity and hatred between the Seculars, and the Religious, was much abated, and the long continued Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie brought to an iſſue. But to paſs now from the matters of Spiritual Government, to temporal and ſecular Affairs, it is to be noted, that about this time moſt mortal feuds and quarrels aroſe between this Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and the two Brothers of the Houſe of <hi>Medicis, Julian</hi> and <hi>Laurence,</hi> the original of which proceeded from the great diſpleaſure which <hi>Laurence</hi> took at the Pope for not conferring a Cardinals Cap on his Brother <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> in revenge of which he being very potent in <hi>Florence,</hi> gave aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance both of men and mony to <hi>Nicolas Vitelli,</hi> Count of <hi>Tiferno,</hi> and Lord of the City of <hi>Caſtello</hi>; whereby after he had been ſubdued, and baniſhed by the Pope, and had reſigned his Right and Poſſeſſion to him, he returned again, with the favour of the people, and re-aſſuming his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, he demoliſhed the Citadel which <hi>Sixtus</hi> for his better ſecurity had made and fortified with a good Gariſon: Upon revolt of the City, the Pope ſent his Nephew Cardinal <hi>Julian</hi> with a ſtrong Army againſt it, and by a long Siege of three months became maſter of it. Nor did <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence de Medicis</hi> only ſhow his indignation againſt the Pope by furniſhing men and mony to <hi>Vitelli,</hi> but likewiſe by diſappointing him of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of <hi>Imola,</hi> the Prince whereof being reduced to great neceſſities for want of mony, offered to ſale; to prevent which, and that it ſhould not fall into the hands of the Pope, who now grew above meaſure great and powerful in <hi>Italy, Laurence</hi> ſupplied the mony, and ſo eaſed the Prince of thoſe neceſſities which compelled him to a ſale of his Patrimony. The Pope growing very angry hereat, and reſolving to revenge theſe affronts, entered into a ſecret conſpiracy with <hi>Francis de Pazzi,</hi> who was head of that Faction, which was contrary to the Houſe of <hi>Medicis,</hi> whereby it was reſolved, that both the Brothers <hi>Laurence</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> ſhould be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and that the Commonwealth of <hi>Florence</hi> ſhould be diſpoſed of, according to the pleaſure of the Pope. But that a deſign ſo impious as this, ſhould not ſeem to have entered into the heart of a Pope, the whole
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50681:229"/>
management was committed to the conduct of <hi>Jeronimo Riario,</hi> who in the firſt place prevailed with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> to ſend an Army into <hi>Tuſcany</hi> under the command of <hi>Alonſo</hi> his Son, and compel the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> either to extirpate the Family of the <hi>Medicis,</hi> or force them to abandon their Country; and that then under colour of the Papal Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the King of <hi>Naples</hi> might introduce his own Authority, and ſet up for himſelf: but to make all things ſure in caſe this ſhould fail, <hi>Jeronimo</hi> communicated his deſign to <hi>John Baptiſta Monteſecco,</hi> a man very expert and ready in ſuch attempts, who quickly engaged ſeveral with him in the Conſpiracy; namely <hi>Bartholomew Salvian</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Piſa,</hi> who had conceived a private pique againſt <hi>Laurence</hi>; alſo <hi>Francis de Pazzi,</hi> and <hi>James Poggio,</hi> whoſe Father was a famous Orator in his time. And to put a better face on the matter, and countenance the Plot, <hi>Raphael Ria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>George,</hi> a youth, and Nephew of <hi>Jeronimo,</hi> was ſent to <hi>Piſa</hi> on pretence of his Studies; under whoſe protection the Aſſaſſinates having performed their work might be the better ſecured. Sunday be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 26th of <hi>April,</hi> was the day appointed for this murder, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Conſpirators, who were many, aſſaulted the two Brothers in the Church, whilſt they were hearing Maſs: <hi>Julian</hi> was there killed, but <hi>Laurence</hi> having received a ſlight wound, ſled into the Veſtery, where he was ſaved from the violence of the Aſſaſſinates; and in the mean time the Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and <hi>James Poggio</hi> endeavoured to poſſeſs themſelves of the Palace belonging to that Signiory: But the rumor hereof ſpreading quickly over all the City, and that <hi>Julian</hi> was killed, and <hi>Laurence</hi> ſtill living, the Party of the <hi>Medicis</hi> took courage, and with Arms in their hands ſeized the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and <hi>James Poggio,</hi> together with their Companions; and putting a Halter about their necks, they executed ſpeedy Juſtice, hanging them out at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. <hi>Antonio da Volterro,</hi> and <hi>Stefano</hi> a Prieſt who attempted <hi>Laurence,</hi> incurred the like fate. <hi>Monteſecco</hi> was tortured to make Confeſſion, which having done, he was likewiſe put to death. The Cardinal at the time of this Combuſtion flying to the High-Altar, was ſcarce protected by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs of the place, and the earneſt interceſſion of <hi>Laurence</hi>; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which having for ſome days been committed to ſafe cuſtody, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had cleared his Innocence, he was out of reſpect and favour to the Pope ſet at liberty. Howſoever <hi>Sixtus</hi> was not ſo well pleaſed with the grace ſhowed to the Cardinal, but that he reſented the ſeverity they had uſed againſt a Prieſt, and an Arch-Biſhop, to that degree, that at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of <hi>Jeronimo Riario,</hi> he interdicted the people of <hi>Florence,</hi> and made War upon them. <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> was made General of the Papal Army, and <hi>Alfonſo</hi> Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> Son of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> was alſo ready with another Army in favour and aſſiſtance of the Pope. On the other ſide <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11th. King of <hi>France</hi> ſent a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor of 300 Horſe to <hi>Florence,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Philip de Comines,</hi> Lord of <hi>Argenton</hi>; and farther to affright the Pope, he ordered a Synod of Prelates aſſembled at <hi>Orleans,</hi> to Decree that no more mony ſhould be carried out of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> for vacant Benefices. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> and Dukes of <hi>Milan, Mantoua,</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi> concerned themſelves in the League, that they might repreſs the ambition of the Pope, whom they eſteemed to be full of deſigns to advance his own power, and glory in <hi>Italy. Laurence de Medicis</hi> by his vigilance, good addreſs, and conduct,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50681:230"/>
ſo well accommodated matters with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> that he engaged that King to his Party, and into an agreement of an Offenſive, and Defenſive War; with which Union and Alliances the Pope being diſcouraged,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1479.</note> the War concluded without any remarkable ſucceſſes; the Pope ſuppreſſing his reſentments until a more ſeaſonable time, when he could with better effect reak his anger, and revenge on his enemies: which he had certainly performed with the firſt opportunity, had he not been ſurprized with a ſuddain alarm from the Turk; who having unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly ſeized the City of <hi>Otranto,</hi> put all <hi>Italy</hi> into fear, and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This accident confirmed the Peace more firmly between <hi>Sixtus</hi> and the <hi>Florentines</hi>; on whom by way of Penance for their late crime, he impoſed a charge of maintaining 15 Gallies againſt the Turk; whoſe great force having entered into <hi>Italy</hi> would certainly in deſpight of all the power of that Country, have made great devaſtations, had not the death of <hi>Mahomet the Great,</hi> who had taken <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> put a ſtop to the progreſs of his Arms, and moved <hi>Bajazet</hi> his Son, and Succeſſor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The fear of the Turk by their Retreat out of <hi>Italy</hi> being extinguiſhed, <hi>Sixtus</hi> re-aſſumed his former deſigns, and in order thereunto favoured the party of the <hi>Venetians</hi> who made War upon <hi>Hercules da Eſte</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> by theſe means all <hi>Italy</hi> was put into a new flame of War, being divided into diverſe Parties and Factions.

On the other were <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the <hi>Florentines, Lodowick Sforza</hi> Protector of the State of <hi>Milan</hi> during the minority of the young Duke. The Pope in favour of his own Party managed his War with the Spiritual as well as with the Temporal Arms; for in the year 1482. he Excommunicated all his Enemies, and as many as took their part, or favoured their Cauſe; and encouraged <hi>René</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> and <hi>Anjou</hi> to return into <hi>Italy,</hi> and recover his Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> But <hi>René</hi> being otherwiſe employed, could not make uſe of this opportunity, which was offered; and therewith <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> being enraged, entered the Dominions of the Pope with a great Army, and approached to the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi>; with which <hi>Sixtus</hi> being greatly incenſed, iſſued out an Army againſt him under the command of <hi>Robert Malateſta</hi>; and both Armies joyning Battel in a place called <hi>Campo Morto,</hi> near <hi>Velitri; Sixtus</hi> had the fortune of the day, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his Enemy; many were ſlain on the place, many principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers taken and carried in triumph into <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> himſelf nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly eſcaped by flight. Three days after which Victory <hi>Malateſta</hi> died, not without ſome ſuſpicion of being poiſoned. Not long after a Peace being concluded between Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> all the Priſoners were ſet at liberty; amongſt which were the Cardinals <hi>Colonna</hi>

And farther to demonſtrate his generous and great Soul, he re-built the Hoſpital of S. <hi>Spirito</hi> for maintainance and education of young Children: he built the Church of S. <hi>Mary of Peace:</hi> he adorned the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilicon</hi> of S. <hi>Peter</hi> with new Windows, making the Church more light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and pleaſant than before: he repaired the Palace of <hi>Lateran,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Churches of the Holy Apoſtles, with ſeveral other Churches.

               <p>But all theſe good actions, and juſt intentions were interrupted by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Diſcords at <hi>Rome</hi> ariſen between the Families of <hi>Colonna</hi> and <hi>Orſini,</hi> on the ground of ancient hatred, and reſentments between them; and had proceeded to worſe effects and more evil conſequences, had they not been aſſwaged for a while by the breaking forth of a forein War with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi>; who having oppreſſed, and ill treated many Lords and great perſonages, and particularly the Count <hi>De Montorio,</hi> who was of great repute and popular in the City of <hi>Aquila</hi>; they all, together with the City of <hi>Abruzzo</hi> had recourſe to the Pope for ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, proteſting, that in caſe he would not receive them into his protection, that they ſhould be forced to yield, and reſign themſelves into the hands and power of ſome Forein Prince.

That the King ſhould pardon and forgive all the Lords, and Barons who were his Subjects, whether they belonged to the City of <hi>Aquila,</hi> or to any other Town, or part of his Dominions who had fled to the Pope for his ſuccour and protection. That he ſhould not farther pretend to any Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Benefices. That he ſhould pay all the arrears of his Tribute at a convenient time appointed. That <hi>Verginio Orſino</hi> ſhould humble himſelf at the foot-ſtool of the Pope, and demand his pardon. All which Articles being agreed, the King of <hi>Spain, Lodowick Sforza,</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo de Medicis,</hi> with two Cardinals, and <hi>James Trivoltii</hi> a great Favourite of the Popes, became Guarrenties for the peace.

               <p>Yet ſome time before his deceaſe, being in the year 1488. he had the honor to have <hi>Zizimé</hi> the Brother of <hi>Bajazet</hi> Emperor of the Turks to be his Priſoner, being taken, and ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Knights of <hi>Rhodes.</hi> And tho this Sultan was ſplendidly received, and treated, yet he could not be induced either by fair perſuaſions, or ruder menaces to proſtrate, or humble himſelf at the feet of the Pope; wherefore being remanded back to ſafe cuſtody in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> he lived there for all the time of this Pope, during which his Brother <hi>Bajazet</hi> Emperor of the Turks ſent yearly to <hi>Rome</hi> forty thouſand Crowns for his maintainance: and to render his Brother more acceptable there, he ſent with an honorable Embaſſy the Key of the Holy Sepulchre at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the Pope, together with the Lance with which <hi>Longinus</hi> pierced the ſide of our Saviour; both which he received with great humility and devotion, lodging the Key in a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, where it is to be ſeen unto this day: and laid the Spear in a Marble Cheſt, which he purpoſely erected in a Chappel within the Church of the <hi>Vatican.</hi> In the time of this Pope <hi>Innocent,</hi> there was but one Creation of Cardinals, at which eight only were made; amongſt which <hi>Laurence Cibo</hi> the natural Son of his Brother was one. In the year 1489. he permitted, that the Maſs might be celebrated in <hi>Norway</hi> without Wine, becauſe that the Country being cold, and the diſtance far, the Wine was either frozen, or turned Vinegar before it could be brought thither. This Pope as we have ſaid,<note place="margin">Du Cheſhè.</note> was generous and magnificent in all his actions, performing many things at his own coſt and charge for the honor and adornment of the City. For he built a houſe of pleaſure and delight for recreation of the Popes, called the <hi>Belvedere</hi>; he re-built the Deanry of S. <hi>Narcis</hi> from the foundation; he made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Galleries in the Palace of the <hi>Vatican</hi>; he erected a Fountain in the front before S. <hi>Peters,</hi> and adorned many other places in the City; and having diſpoſed all things in order to the quiet and happineſs of <hi>Italy,</hi> he ended his days, and died the 25th. day of <hi>July,</hi> 1491. being about the age of ſixty years.

This ſort of treatment towards his Friends induced <hi>Guichardin</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of this Pope to repreſent him under the notion of a perſon without Truth, without Faith, or Religion, of an unſatiable avarice, and inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable pride, and paſſionate in the raiſing and advancement of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Sons (which were many in number) to places of dignity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; the which character is farther confirmed by all the <hi>Italian</hi> Poets and Hiſtorians of thoſe times, who aſcribe ſtrange and monſtrous cruelties to him, making him the Author of all thoſe Calamities and Miſeries which in his Reign over-whelmed <hi>Italy,</hi> rendering its condition ſlaviſh, and contemptible to Forein Nations. Howſoever his temper was not ſo alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether flagitious, but that it admitted of ſome alloy, and mixture of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50681:233"/>
Virtue: for he with great care attended to the government of the City, and regulation of the Courts of Juſtice; to which end he ordained Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors of the Priſons to examin, and know the cauſes for which perſons were impriſoned, and created four Judges for the tryal of all criminal matters, ſo that Juſtice was the more punctually executed, than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times. But not to remain too long on his perſonal qualities, let us proceed to the important affairs of his Government.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt place, being created Pope, he was according to cuſtom ſaluted, and congratulated in his Papal Dignity by the Ambaſſadors of Kings, Princes, and States, whom he reſpectively treated with affabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and reſpect; perſuading them to peace and concord amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and by the virtue of ſuch union and confederacy to joyn, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their Arms againſt the Turk, who was the common Enemy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. And at that time being about the year 1493. in honor to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he gave him the Title of Catholick, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment and memory of the many Victories he had obtained over the Moors; and gave him a Title to all thoſe Lands and Countries in <hi>America,</hi> which were or ſhould be diſcovered there. And thus as he was civil to Kings, ſo he was kind and more affectionate to his Family. For in the firſt Conſiſtory that he held, he created <hi>John Borgia</hi> his Siſters Son Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Montreat, Valentine Borgia</hi> his Natural Son Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Valentia.</hi> At this time the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> died, having reigned for the ſpace of 54 years. Likewiſe <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> being dead, he ſent his Legat with power to confirm his Son <hi>Alonſo</hi> in the ſucceſſion to the Kingdom; and having contracted an Alliance with him, he ordered him to be Crowned, and inveſted with the Regali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>At this time being the year 1494. <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, King of <hi>France,</hi> who was of a martial and ambitious ſpirit laid claim to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> by virtue of the laſt Will and Teſtament of <hi>René</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> and <hi>Lorain</hi>; and being encouraged in that enterpriſe by <hi>Lodowick Sforza,</hi> the Guardian of <hi>John Galeas</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> he entered <hi>Italy</hi> with a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant Army, conſiſting of 25000 Foot, and 5000 Horſe, with a great train of Artillery. The Pope apprehending the great ruine and damage which this incurſion of the French would bring upon <hi>Italy,</hi> entered into League with the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> and both agreed and reſolved to leavy Soldiers, and joyn in a defenſive League with the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> but the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> who were likewiſe moved to enter into the League, did poſitively refuſe to accept the propoſals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more inclinable to be unconcerned and Spectators than Actors in that hazardous War. <hi>Charles</hi> being entered into <hi>Italy,</hi> marched victorious thro <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and having overthrown the Army of <hi>Florence,</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter became Maſter Of the City it ſelf: thence he proceeded towards <hi>Rome,</hi> where he entered on the firſt of <hi>January</hi> 1494. without any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; it being agreed that in caſe the <hi>Romans</hi> would peaceably open their Gates, and give free admiſſion to the <hi>French,</hi> that no hurt, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſhould be offered by them to the Inhabitants, but that on the contrary, if they made oppoſition, they would put all into flame and confuſion. The <hi>Romans</hi> therefore finding themſelves in no condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reſiſt, readily gave a reception to the <hi>French,</hi> affording them plenty of Victuals, and Proviſions; and they on the other ſide performed their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50681:234"/>
conditions, ſeverely puniſhing ſuch as were guilty of Riots, or Tumults. The Pope at firſt being affrighted with the approach of the <hi>French,</hi> fled for ſecurity into the Caſtle, but at length finding all things quiet and ſecure from the outrages of their Gheſts, adventured abroad, and much againſt his will and inclinations entered into a League with them. But <hi>Charles</hi> not much confiding in the Faith which the Pope had given, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for better ſecurity thereof, and by way of Hoſtage, that <hi>Ceſar Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> who was called Cardinal <hi>Valentino,</hi> ſhould under colour of being the Popes Legat, accompany him in the War, together with <hi>Zizimé</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Grand Seignior, on pretence, that having overcome the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> he would make uſe of him in the War, which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make upon <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>; but he died ſoon after of a Bloody-Flux at <hi>Capua.</hi> Upon approach of the <hi>French</hi> near to <hi>Naples,</hi> King <hi>Alonſo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious of his ill government, whereby he had contracted the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of his people, and deſpairing of the ſucceſs of his Affairs, ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred up the Kingdom into the hands of his Son <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and with great fear and ignominy embarked himſelf with the beſt part of his wealth, and fled into the Iſland of <hi>Sicily</hi>; and ſoon after <hi>Ferdinand</hi> conſidering the weakneſs of his Force, and the inequality of the Match between him and the <hi>French,</hi> betook himſelf alſo to the Iſland of <hi>Iſchia. Charles</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the favourable courſe of his good, and victorious fortune, with great expedition made himſelf Maſter of all the Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> the which ſucceſs giving an alarm to all the Chriſtian Princes, a general confederacy was agreed amongſt them, for intercepting the <hi>French</hi> on their return out of <hi>Italy</hi>; ſo that the Pope, the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain, Lodowick Sforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Forces for the common ſafety of <hi>Italy,</hi> compoſed an Army of forty thouſand men. Notwithſtanding which <hi>Charles</hi> boldly returned out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and with great difficulty having paſſed the <hi>Apenine</hi> Mountains with ſixteen pieces of weighty Cannons which were drawn over by 300 <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> and having by the greater error and neglect of the Enemy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the narrow and inacceſſible ways about <hi>Zerzana</hi> and <hi>Petra Santa</hi> at length deſcended into the Plains of <hi>Lombardy.</hi> The Confederate Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to hinder the Kings farther paſſage had encamped themſelves at <hi>Fornovo,</hi> near <hi>Tarro,</hi> and at no far diſtance from <hi>Parma</hi>; and there both Armies were engaged. The <hi>French</hi> did not conſiſt of more than 9000 men, and the Confederates of 40000; and yet the <hi>French</hi> had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and won the Field: and as <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> ſaith, the King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered triumphant into <hi>Aſti</hi>; tho <hi>Panvinio</hi> and other <hi>Italian</hi> Writers relate the Battel to have been bloody, but the ſucceſs and advantage doubtful. Howſoever the news hereof being reported at <hi>Naples</hi> to the great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Confederates, King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> re-aſſumed his courage, and adventured out of his retirement at <hi>Iſchia</hi>; and then the <hi>French</hi> Forces being grown weak, and all Recruits failing them, he recovered his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with the aſſiſtance of the Catholick King: Not long after <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth died, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſucceeded in his Throne: Likewiſe <hi>Ferdinand</hi> dying without Iſſue, <hi>Frederick</hi> his Uncle became his Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. continuing his claim by right of Inheritance to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and alſo to the Dukedom of <hi>Milan</hi> in right of his Grandmother the Daughter of <hi>John Galeazzo,</hi> entered into a League
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50681:234"/>
with the Pope, which was fatal to <hi>Italy</hi>; and with them the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> were all combined againſt Duke <hi>Lodowick Sforza,</hi> and King <hi>Frederick,</hi> on conditions that <hi>Lewis</hi> having conquered <hi>Milan,</hi> ſhould cauſe <hi>Cremona</hi> to be reſtored to the <hi>Venetians</hi>; and that <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> who was the Popes baſtard Son, having renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his Cardinals Cap, and taking <hi>Carlotta de Alebretto,</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and Kinſwoman to the King of <hi>France</hi> for his Wife, ſhould be inveſted in <hi>Romagna, Marca,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria,</hi> and that the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> ſhould equally divide the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. <hi>Lewis</hi> entering <hi>Italy</hi> with a powerful Army, drove out the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> from his State, and ſhortly after took Cardinal <hi>Aſcanius</hi> Priſoner, whom he ſent into <hi>France,</hi> where he died in a ſhort time afterwards. The <hi>Venetians</hi> by virtue of the League had <hi>Cremona</hi> conſigned to them; and all matters ſucceeded ſo proſperouſly for <hi>Lewis</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Frederick</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> being thereby wholly diſ-anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, caſt himſelf with all humble confidence into the arms of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> who treated him baſely, and with the higheſt indignities imaginable. In the mean time the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being to divide the ſpoils of the Kingdom, ſuch differences aroſe betwixt them, as being only to be decided by the Sword, the <hi>French</hi> were all cut in pieces by the valor of <hi>Gonſalvo</hi> a brave Captain, by which means that Kingdom fell into the hands of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> being attentive to nothing more than to raiſe and enrich his Baſtard Children, encouraged and countenanced his Son <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> in the grievous oppreſſions he laid, on all the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the Eccleſiaſtical State; for he deſigning and aſpiring to make himſelf ſole, and abſolute maſter of it, made the Family of the <hi>Orſini</hi> the moſt remarkable examples of his inſolent indignities, ſpoiling and haraſſing their Country for the ſpace of a whole Summer. As yet <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar Borgia</hi> had not renounced his Cardinals Cap, and therefore continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill under the notion of a Prelate, <hi>Guido <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldo di <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> and <hi>John Borgia,</hi> an other of the Popes Baſtards, were made Generals of the Eccleſiaſtical Army, who over-running ſeveral Countries, reduced <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciano</hi> by Siege, and proceeded every where victoriouſly, until <hi>Charles</hi> the natural Son of <hi>Virginio Orſino,</hi> joyning Battel with them, routed their Army, and took the Duke of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> priſoner. After this a Peace being concluded with the <hi>Orſini,</hi> and the Pope perceiving that his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did not thrive well by War, he endeavoured to advance his deſigns by fortifying the intereſt of his Family with great, and potent alliances; and in the firſt place he gave his Daughter <hi>Lucretia</hi> in Marriage to <hi>John Sforza,</hi> Lord of <hi>Peſaro,</hi> breaking his promiſe to a certain Nobleman of <hi>Spain</hi> to whom he had formerly contracted her; then he took her from <hi>Sforza,</hi> and gave her to <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> Baſtard Son of <hi>Alfonſo</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi>; who being killed, ſhe was given to <hi>Alfonſo da Eſté</hi> Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> with whom afterwards ſhe ended her days.</p>
               <p>This Pope had alſo three Sons, <hi>Geoffery</hi> the youngeſt was made Prince of <hi>Squillaci, Caeſar</hi> who was the ſecond was Cardinal, and <hi>John</hi> the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt was ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> and there made Duke of <hi>Candia</hi>; but he ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling one night in his pleaſures about the Streets of <hi>Rome,</hi> was by the treachery of his Brother the Cardinal aſſaſſinated, and his body thrown into the <hi>

                     </gap>ybar</hi>; which kindneſs he did him after they had ſupped the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50681:235"/>
ſame night together at the Table of their Mother <hi>Vanoccia</hi>; with which horrid act the Pope was not ſo much diſpleaſed, as he was terrified, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that upon the leaſt diſpleaſure the ſpirit of this miſcreant would be provoked to add parricide to the murder of his Brother. After this he made little account of his Scarlet, or degree of Cardinal; but turning his thoughts wholly to War, he was made General of the Popes Army, and uniting his Forces with the <hi>French,</hi> and joyning with their intereſt, he became maſter of a conſiderable Principality in <hi>Italy:</hi> for having expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sforza</hi> from <hi>Milan,</hi> and impriſoned the Chiefs of that Family, with aſſiſtance of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th, he with great cruelty and blood poſſeſſed himſelf of all the Cities of <hi>Romagna,</hi> (<hi>Bologna</hi> only excepted) baniſhing, or putting to death all the ancient Lords and perſons of quality belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. He alſo took <hi>Imola</hi> and <hi>Forli,</hi> baniſhing all the Children of <hi>Riario,</hi> to whom the Inheritance belonged, only their Mother <hi>Catherina</hi> he took priſoner, and carried her in triumph with him to <hi>Rome.</hi> Next he took <hi>Sinigaglia</hi> by force of Arms, and by treachery ſurprized the State of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi>; for being with all his Army at <hi>Cagli</hi> where he was kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, upon the ſignal given, he ſeized that City, and marched imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately with the ſame deſign to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin. Guido <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldo da Feltro,</hi> Prince of that State, ſurprized with this ſuddain attempt, and fearing to fall into the cruel hands of this Tyrant, left the City, and with ſome few of his domeſticks ſaved himſelf by flight. Then this <hi>Borgia</hi> turned his Arms upon <hi>Camerino,</hi> which he took, and put many of the ancient Lords, and Barons of it to death: with the like cruelty and wickedneſs he treated all the Lords, and Barons about the parts of <hi>Rome,</hi> particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that noble Family of the <hi>Gaetani,</hi> which were Lords of ancient poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the <hi>Volſci</hi>; of which he put <hi>James</hi> the Son of <hi>Honorato Gaetano</hi> to death, then Protonotary of <hi>Rome:</hi> He alſo ordered that <hi>Cola Gaetano</hi> a youth, who was the only Son, and hopes of the Family, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the world. He in the next place by aſſiſtance of the <hi>French,</hi> attacked the Family of <hi>Colonna,</hi> and ſeized on all their State, forcing them to fly into <hi>Puglia,</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> for refuge. His next and laſt work was to ſubdue the <hi>Orſini,</hi> but they having always been conſtant and firm friends to the Pope in all times, and againſt all Factions, he wanted ſome colourable pretence to fix a quarrel on them: but at length the occaſion which he ſought, the <hi>Orſini</hi> themſelves adminiſtred; for they growing jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the ſucceſſes, and fortune of <hi>Borgia,</hi> and fearing leſt his inſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able avarice ſhould tranſport him alſo to an appetite of devouring them, they conſidered it prudence to provide in time againſt a danger ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and imminent as this: wherefore conſulting with others, who were poſſeſſed with the like apprehenſions and fears; ſuch as <hi>Bentivolio</hi> Lord of <hi>Bologna, Paolo Baglione</hi> the Uſurper of <hi>Perugia, Vitellozzo Vitelli,</hi> Lord of the City of <hi>Caſtello, Liverotto</hi> Lord <hi>Fermo, Pandolfo Petrucci</hi> of <hi>Siena</hi>; they appointed a Council to be held at <hi>Perugia,</hi> where they agreed upon an alliance, and confederacy together againſt <hi>Borgia</hi>; and accordingly ſetting out an Army into the Field, they took <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> and <hi>Camerino,</hi> and overthrew the Forces of <hi>Borgia</hi> which came to relieve them, and thence made an incurſion into all the Country of <hi>Romagna.</hi> The Pope being greatly troubled, and concerned for theſe loſſes, and turn of fortune, uſed all his ſubtilty and artifices to reconcile theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; and his Authority being very prevalent, he perſuaded the <hi>Orſini</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:50681:235"/>
into a Peace, and into an aſſurance of all ſecurity; in ſhort therefore with promiſes, and proteſtations, and conditions of great advantage, he deluded them into a Peace, and into Articles which he never deſigned to perform. With theſe feigned appearances of reconciliation, the Towns taken from <hi>Borgia</hi> were ſurrendred to him; and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Francis Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſino</hi> Duke of <hi>Gravina, Vitellozzo,</hi> and <hi>Liverotto</hi> then together at <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaglia</hi> went to attend <hi>Borgia</hi> at <hi>Imola,</hi> and to receive his Pardon. <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> went forth to meet them; and gave them a moſt courteous reception; and conducting them into an inward Room in his Palace; as if he had had ſomething of importance to communicate to them, he on a ſudden encompaſſed them with his <hi>Gaſcon</hi> Soldiers, and ſtrangled <hi>Vitellozzo,</hi> and <hi>Liverotto,</hi> and in a ſhort time after beſtowed the like fare on the two <hi>Orſini</hi>; all which proceeded from the credulity and eaſineſs of <hi>Paul Orſino,</hi> who againſt the Opinion, and Proteſts, and Diſſuaſions of <hi>Vitellozzo,</hi> being corrupted, as was ſuppoſed, by Mony, condeſcended to the terms of <hi>Borgia,</hi> and to truſt, and believe his Faith, who was a known Tyrant, bloody, and falſe, and his life blackned already with a thouſand inſtances of Murder and Perjury: hereupon <hi>Perugia,</hi> and the City of <hi>Caſtello</hi> ſurrendred themſelves into the hands of the Pope, the Families of <hi>Baglio</hi> and <hi>Vitello</hi> being baniſhed thence. This ſucceſs was followed by the impriſonment of <hi>Baptiſta Orſini</hi> the Cardinal, who was by order of the Pope committed to the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo:</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Renold</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>James de Sancta Croce</hi> being of the ſame Family, were likewiſe impriſoned; <hi>James</hi> howſoever had liberty to go out upon Bail, but the Cardinal was in a few days poiſoned in the Priſon.</p>
               <p>In vigor of this ſucceſs <hi>Borgia,</hi> now called Duke <hi>Valentino,</hi> proſecuted the other Confederates with an Army of 15000 men, for fear of which <hi>Pandolfo Petrucci</hi> leaving his Town of <hi>Siena,</hi> fled to <hi>Lucca</hi> for ſuccor and refuge, whilſt <hi>Borgia</hi> became Maſter of all the Caſtles, and Fortreſſes belonging to the Family of the <hi>Orſini.</hi> Thus did he continue his Wars with ſuch great expence, and with a magnificent Equipage agreeable thereunto, that the Coffers of the Pope became exhauſted, the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the Church, not being able to provide for ſuch vaſt deſigns. To ſupply which, this Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> renewed the ancient form of eighty Writers of Breviates, according to the cuſtom of former Popes, every of which Offices were ſold for 750 Crowns of Gold: he ſold alſo all other Offices at exceſſive rates, and created Cardinals for Mony: he alſo entertained the <hi>Marrani</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from his Countries, preferring the profit which he ſqueezed from them, more than all the favour and intereſt of that King. In fine, he omitted no ways and arts, honeſt, or diſhoneſt, to raiſe Mony, ſetting every thing to ſale. that was vendible, or could yield a benefit: But all the Revenue of the Church, and theſe contrivances, and artifices for raiſing Mony, not being able to anſwer the expences of the War, and the immenſe luxury and prodigality of Duke <hi>Valentino,</hi> it was reſolved by the Pope to poiſon all the rich Cardinals, and Prelates at <hi>Rome,</hi> and then ſeizing their Revenue and Eſtates, to ſacrifice their Riches to the luſt and inſatiable avarice of his wicked Son. The Plot being thus laid, the rich Cardinals and Prelates were invited to a Banquet in the Garden of <hi>Belvedere,</hi> where a Table was ſpread near a Fountain, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50681:236"/>
Bottles of excellent Wine provided; thoſe for the Pope and his Son were ſet apart, from thoſe into which the poiſon was infuſed, being deſigned for the Gueſts only: But here let us obſerve the juſt Judgment of God, for the Butler and Cup-bearer miſtaking the Bottle, gave the poiſonous Doſe to the Pope, and his Son, and to Cardinal <hi>Adrian</hi> their ſole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, inſtead of that which was to have been given to the Cardinals, and his other Gueſts. The Pope being aged at the years of 72, and not able to ſtruggle with the violence of the Poiſon, died at the <hi>Vatican</hi> in the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1503. and was buried obſcurely in a Chappel of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, under a poor and ignoble Monument: but <hi>Borgia</hi> applying preſent Antidotes, and being a man of a young and robuſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, was able for ſome time to ſtruggle with the prevailing force of the Poiſon; howſoever the malignity of it ſo crept into his Vitals, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his Blood, that his Body growing macerate and weak, and being ill diſpoſed, and faint, he was not able to attend to his Affairs, and the diſcipline of his Army; for want of which, and the encouragement of his preſence, the Soldiers forſook their Colours, as being aſhamed of the deteſtable Villany of their Commander, and therewith his whole Army disbanded, leaving him naked, and expoſed to the diſpleaſure of two Popes, which in a ſhort time afterwards appeared, that were his mortal enemies. After which, all the Cities and Fortreſſes which he had by force, and rapine poſſeſſed, returned again to their ancient Maſters; the Families of <hi>Colonna, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini, Savelli, Vitelli,</hi> and <hi>Barons</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> reaſſumed their former right; and likewiſe the Lords of the Signories of <hi>

               <p>Notwithſtanding the wickedneſs of this Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth, there are thoſe who will allow him ſome grains of Virtue. They ſay that he was of a ready Wit, of a great Memory, and profound Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and of that perſuaſive Eloquence, that it was impoſſible almoſt to refute his Arguments, or deny his Demands. He treated the Cardinals with great affability, and reſpect, and gave high demonſtrations of his care, and concernment for the Chriſtian Cauſe. He knew ſo well how to accommodate himſelf to the humor of the <hi>French,</hi> that he reconciled their Party to him in a firm and ſtrict Alliance; and ſo well how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, that amidſt all the violences, and ſlaughters which he cauſed to be committed in <hi>Rome,</hi> no tumult, or inſurrection of the People enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereupon. He always went late to bed, contenting himſelf with little ſleep, and a moderate diet: he was a great lover of Learning, and men of Literature; ſo that tho he was covetous, yet he was ſaid, never to have detained the allowance to Doctors, nor pay of the Soldiery, nor wages of Workmen.</p>
               <p>Howſoever his Vices were ſo enormous, that theſe mean Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could bear no ballance with them. For he was a man of no Faith, nor Honor; he was Cruel, Covetous, and inſatiable of Riches. At any time of vacation from buſineſs, he gave himſelf up wholly to delights, and pleaſures, eſpecially to Women, whom he loved in exceſs; but the Miſtriſs of his Affection was the fair <hi>Vanoccia,</hi> a Roman Lady, whom in the time of his private fortune and condition he kept and owned as a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50681:236"/>
lawful Wife. He was a great lover of Plays and Comedies, and would be always a ſpectator of Shows, and pleaſant divertiſements. In his time he created 43 Cardinals, of which 18 were <hi>Spaniards.</hi> In the year 1500. he celebrated the Jubilee according to ancient cuſtoms, giving Bulls, and Indulgences, for Sins, to all thoſe who perſonally viſited the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to ſuch alſo who being hindered by their occaſions were made partakers of his bountiful remiſſions. Thus he who could ſo eaſily pardon the ſins of others, muſt expect the final Sentence of him, who is the juſt Judg, and renders to every one according to his demerit.</p>

But on the contrary, it will not ſeem ſo ſtrange, if it be conſidered, that he had been a long time Cardinal, and by degrees gained ſuch intereſt, and authority in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he was ſtiled the principal Defender of the Eccleſiaſtical Dignity, and Authority, that he was mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in his Buildings, generous in his benefits, and ſo punctual to his word, that Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was otherwiſe his mortal enemy, would yet do him that right, as to confeſs him faithful, and juſt to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his promiſes: but yet this good quality which he was ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preſerve in his private condition; he made no ſcruple, or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to violate that he might become Pope: for the obtaining of which, he made ſuch immoderate promiſes to Cardinals, Princes, and Barons, that he well knew the whole Revenue, and Price of the Papal Sea, if ſet to ſale, had not been able to have ſatisfied; and therefore 'tis not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to imagin, how the promiſes of a perſon, not uſed to beguile, ſhould procure a confidence in the minds of the moſt ſcrupulous, and wary perſons.

               <p>The firſt enterpriſe therefore that he undertook, was to drive out and expel <hi>John Bentivoglio,</hi> his old inveterate enemy, who had unjuſtly uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a power over the City of <hi>Bologna</hi>; forcing him with his Wife, and Children to remain baniſhed in <hi>Baſſetto,</hi> a Country belonging to the Dominions of <hi>Parma,</hi> and contentedly to conſent to the deſtruction of his Palace, which was a fair and noble ſtructure.</p>

                  </note> without acknowledging other ſuperiority, than the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, which they offered to pay readily, when it ſhould be required.

of utterly ſubverting the <hi>Venetian</hi> State; the Pope reſolved to fortifie himſelf by a League with <hi>Spain,</hi> and having hired a great number of <hi>Switzers,</hi> he joyned the Army of the Church with that of the <hi>Venetians</hi>; and having thereby compoſed a Body or about 12000 Foot, under the command of <hi>Franciſco Moralva,</hi> he took the City of <hi>Modena,</hi> and the City and Territory of <hi>Mirandola,</hi> and then returned triumphantly to <hi>Bologna.</hi> But this good ſucceſs continued not long; for the <hi>French</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong, did firſt by an Army under Monſieur <hi>Claumont,</hi> attempt the Siege of <hi>Bologna</hi>; but the Pope being recruited with the Forces of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> obliged <hi>Chaumont</hi> to withdraw his Army, after the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Peace negotiated by <hi>Laurence Pucci</hi> the Popes Datary of <hi>Florence,</hi> were rendred ineffectual.

In the mean time ſeveral accuſations were brought to him of Treaſon and Cowardiſe againſt the Cardinal of <hi>Pavia,</hi> whom the Pope ſo entirely loved, that no prejudicate thoughts could take place in his mind againſt him; and therefore when the Cardinal came to <hi>Revenna</hi> to clear himſelf of the aſperſions which were caſt upon him; the Pope ſeemed ſo little to be touched, or affected with them, that as ſoon as the Cardinal arrived and demanded Audience, he rejoyced much, and invited him to Dinner. But as he was going to the Popes Palace, attended with a Guard of Horſemen, the Duke of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> bearing an ancient grudg, and hatred to him, reproaching him of Cowardiſe, which had cauſed the loſs of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi> and the ſlight of the Army; he with a ſmall train ruſht in amongſt his Guard of Horſemen, who out of reverence and reſpect made him way, and with a Poniard ſlew the Cardinal with his own hand: who, tho for the degree he held, ought to have been treated at another rate; yet for his infinite Vices deſerved a more cruel puniſhment. The death of the Cardinal of <hi>Pavia</hi> by the many ill circumſtances of it, did more nearly affect the Pope; for the murder having been perpetrated by his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew upon his deareſt Favourite, on a Cardinal of his high Degree, and in a place ſo near his perſon, were all aggravations to increaſe his grief,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50681:239"/>
and ſhame, who had made profeſſions to preſerve and exalt the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Dignity. The Pope not able to beat this grief, nor attemper his fury, departed the ſame day from <hi>Ravenna</hi> to <hi>Rome:</hi> and for the greater augmentation of his trouble, and grief, he was overtaken in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as he travelled, with a report, that at <hi>Bologna, Modena,</hi> and other Cities, Placarts were affixed in all publick places, denouncing and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a Council to be held, and celebrated on the firſt day of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> following at <hi>Piſa,</hi> where the Pope himſelf was alſo cited to appear. This Council was convened by the Authority of the diſſenting Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, ſuch as <hi>Bernardino Carvagiale</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was the chief lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and director of the Schiſm, <hi>William Briſoner</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Biſhop, <hi>Francis Borgia</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Cecilia, Renat de Brie</hi> a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> Cardinal of S. <hi>Sabina,</hi> and <hi>Frederick Sanſeverino,</hi> an <hi>Italian,</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of S. <hi>Angelo:</hi> all which agreed, and pretended that a Council might, where was apparent neceſſity, be judicially convoked by them: and that when a Pope was guilty of Simony, infamous and damnable in his manners, Author of ſo many Wars,<note place="margin">Guicciardin, lib. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> and notoriouſly incorrigible to the univerſal ſcandal of all Chriſtendom; that then the power of convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Council (which was the only remedy, and redreſs for ſo many evils) did lawfully devolve unto them, eſpecially having the Authority of the Emperor, and the conſent of the moſt Chriſtian King, together with the Clergy of <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> concurring. The Pope enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with this bold attempt of his contumacious Cardinals, iſſued out his Excommunications againſt them, depriving them of their Hats, Honors, and Dignities Eccleſiaſtical: notwithſtanding which, the deſign of the Council proceeded, and on the firſt day of <hi>September,</hi> the Proctors of the Cardinals being come to <hi>Piſa,</hi> did there celebrate the Acts for open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame: with which the Pope conceiving yet higher indignation, againſt the <hi>Florentines,</hi> for that they had ſuffered the Conventicle, (for ſo he called it) to take beginning in their State, did declare, and publiſh, that whoſoever did favour the Conventicle of <hi>Piſa,</hi> did ſtand actually Excommunicated, Interdicted, and ſubject to all the Penalties ſeverely ordained by Laws againſt Schiſmaticks and Hereticks; and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. King of <hi>France,</hi> together with the Cities of <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Piſa,</hi> did ſtand actually Excommunicated and Interdicted. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to countermine this Council, he publiſhed a General Council to be held at the <hi>Lateran</hi>; and to do the greateſt deſpight imaginable to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> he conſtituted Cardinal <hi>John de Medices,</hi> who with his whole Family was exiled from <hi>Florence,</hi> Legate of <hi>Bologna, Romagna,</hi> and of the whole Army of the League: and to give farther diverſion and trouble in <hi>France,</hi> he incited <hi>Henry</hi> VIII, King of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> to joyn in a League with him; the firſt to enter his Forces into <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> and the latter to wage War on the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who being joyned in Confederacy with <hi>Lewis,</hi> did likewiſe lie under the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Excommunication. Matters being thus diſpoſed, he finiſhed the Articles of a League made with the Catholick King, and the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> which was ſolemnly publiſhed on the 5th. of <hi>October</hi> in the Church of <hi>Santa Maria del Popolo,</hi> the Pope and Cardinals being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. where it was ſolemnly declared, that the intent thereof was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Unity of the Church, to defend her from the preſent Schiſm, to recover the City of <hi>Bologna,</hi> which was the right of the Church, to confound the Aſſembly at <hi>Piſa,</hi> and finally to chaſe, and expel the <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50681:240"/>
by force of Arms out of <hi>Italy. Lewis</hi> finding himſelf on all ſides hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſet, haſtned the Recruits of his Army, and withdrawing the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had in <hi>Breſcia,</hi> which he had lately recovered from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and from <hi>Bologna,</hi> which compoſed in all a Body of about 15500 men, he marched by <hi>Ravenna,</hi> in order to joyn with the Troops of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who was then Confederate with <hi>France.</hi> The Popes Army, with the Allies conſiſting of about 13000 Foot, and 1800 men at Arms, marched towards the relief of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which was then hardly beſieged by the <hi>French</hi> Army, under the Command of <hi>Gaſton de Foix</hi> a valiant, and experienced General. The Papal Army being encamped at no far diſtance from the <hi>French,</hi> endeavoured to avoid a Battel, which the Enemy frequently offered them; but finding that unleſs they did fight, <hi>Ravenna</hi> would be taken, for ſuch wide breaches were made in the Walls by the Cannon, that the Enemy was ready to enter, and in ſight of their Army to make themſelves Maſters of the City; to prevent which, and the diſgrace of ſuch a miſchief, time was not farther to be loſt, nor an Engagement to be longer declined; ſo that on Eaſter day both Armies joyned Battel: The Fight continued ſo very long, and bloody, that in the ſpace of ſix hours, it was ſcarcely diſcernable to which ſide the Victory inclined. At length, by direction of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the Cannon being brought by a long compaſs about to play on the Flank of the Army, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> began to fly, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Baggage and the glory of the day unto the <hi>French,</hi> which they gained with ſo much blood, and loſs of the principal Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and flower of their Army, that they ſeemed rather vanquiſhed, than Conquerors, and to remain in a condition which afforded them no cauſe of triumph in their Victory. It is ſaid that twenty thouſand men were ſlain in this Battel, and the numbers almoſt equal on each ſide: amongſt which 150 Gentlemen belonging to the Court of the <hi>French</hi> King were killed, five of the Family of <hi>Colonna,</hi> with <hi>Gaſton de Foix</hi> their General. Of the Popes Army the Legate <hi>John de Medices,</hi> with ſeveral other Captains was taken Priſoner. The firſt news of this Defeat, and the ill conſequences thereof, (which was the taking and ſacking of <hi>Ravenna</hi>) was entertained at <hi>Rome</hi> with great fear and tumult; ſo that the Cardinals running haſtily to the Pope, urged and preſſed him with earneſt and vehement Petitions to conclude the War, and accept ſuch reaſonable and moderate conditions, as they were aſſured the King of <hi>France</hi> would be ready to offer. On the other ſide the Embaſſadors of the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> entertained other ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, judging from the advices they had received, that matters were not reduced to ſuch extremities, as the fears and melancholy fancies of the Cardinals ſuggeſted: for that the <hi>French</hi> Army had not gained this Victory with ſo little loſs, but that the great effuſion of blood which it had coſt, had weakened their Force to a degree, as was not in a ſhort time to be recovered; nor was the death of that valiant and wiſe Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Gaſton de Foix,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Guicciardin, lib. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> and other Captains ſlain on the <hi>French</hi> ſide to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in this age. Likewiſe it was further urged, that the Vice-Roy was eſcaped with the greater part of the Cavalry, and that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Infantry were retreated from the Battel in good order, which being joyned with the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> which were daily expected, there would be no neceſſity at preſent of yielding to the conditions of the <hi>French,</hi> which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50681:240"/>
in this conjuncture, would be very unequal, and diſhonorable, and that therewith they muſt expect to receive Laws from the pride of <hi>Bernardin Carvagiale,</hi> and the inſolence of <hi>Frederick de Sancta Severin,</hi> and the other diſſenting and Schiſmatical Cardinals. Things being in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner debated before the Pope, he remained doubtful what to conclude, or reſolve, fear and hope ſtriving within him: But whilſt he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in ſuſpenſe, the courſe of fortune began to turn; for Monſieur <hi>de Paliſſa,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Gaſton de Foix</hi> in the command of the <hi>French</hi> Army on a ſuddain departed from <hi>Romagna,</hi> and drew all his Forces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> being alarmed by deſcent of the <hi>Swiſſers</hi> into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> leaving only 300 Lances, 300 Light-Horſemen, and 6000 Foot, with eight pieces of Artillery behind, under command of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of the Council. This news delivered the Pope from the fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> and confirmed the ſtate of his affairs in ſuch manner, that he reſolved to continue the War with better hopes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>For the Pope's affairs having regained their reputation, the new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil lately convened, was on the firſt of <hi>May</hi> opened in the Church of S. <hi>John Lateran</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; to this Aſſembly the diſſenting Cardinals were cited to give their attendance; but they not appearing, were on the 8th. day of the Seſſions declared contumacious, and Excommunicated, and deprived of all their Temporal and Spiritual Degrees, Honors, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and the people abſolved from their Submiſſion, and Obedience to them. It was farther alſo declared, That their Council held at <hi>Piſa,</hi> and afterwards removed to <hi>Milan,</hi> was but a Conventicle, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and Schiſmatical Meeting, and all their Acts rendered void, null, and of none effect. In the mean time the Cities of <hi>Lombardy</hi> being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> who were now come into <hi>Italy</hi> in favour of the Pope, revolted, and re-aſſuming their ancient Liberty, aſſailed the <hi>French</hi> with open force, and overthrew them. The <hi>Venetians</hi> alſo joyning with them, proſecuted their Victory in ſuch manner, that in the ſpace of 70 days after the Battel of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Army was almoſt wholly defeated; and the remainder by order of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> was recalled to his aſſiſtance againſt the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> who at that time mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably infeſted his Country: ſo that in a ſhort time all <hi>Italy</hi> was freed from the ſlavery of the <hi>French.</hi> The diſſenting Cardinals having loſt their protection at <hi>Milan,</hi> fled from thence to <hi>Lions,</hi> where they were kindly received, and entertained at the charge of King <hi>Lewis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> being thus driven out of <hi>Italy,</hi> all the Cities and Towns belonging to the Pope, did by conſequence return to the Eccleſiaſtical State: <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> being dependencies on the Exarchat of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi> voluntarily yielded to the Pope, all the other Towns of <hi>Romagna</hi> followed their example, together with <hi>Bologna</hi>; which caſting off all reſpect to the Family of the <hi>Bentivogli,</hi> expelled them from their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines; with which the Pope not being ſatisfied, purſued them with the thunder of his Excommunications. <hi>Genoua</hi> being alſo abandoned by the <hi>French,</hi> was poſſeſſed by <hi>Fregoſo.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> ſeized on <hi>Crema,</hi> and <hi>Breſcia,</hi> ſuch of the Family of the <hi>Medices,</hi> as had followed the Popes Party, were re-inſtated in <hi>Florence; Peter Joderini,</hi> who had been crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perpetual Gonfaloniere, being expelled thence. The State of <hi>Milan</hi> was reſigned to <hi>Maximilian Sforza,</hi> as the true, and lawful Prince; all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50681:241"/>
which benefits, and happy ſucceſſes being procured by the Arms of the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> they were in the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> adjudged and declared to be the Reſtorers of the Liberties of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now all things being reſtored to this happy ſtate, the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the <hi>Venetians</hi> in virtue of the late Articles to deliver <hi>Verona,</hi> and <hi>Vicenza</hi> to <hi>Maximilian</hi>; which they obſtinately refuſing to perform, he entered into a League with the Emperor againſt them. The <hi>Venetians</hi> on the other ſide being well acquainted with the temper of the Pope, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated themſelves in an Alliance with <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, hoping by his aſſiſtance and protection to defend themſelves from that League: to this intereſt likewiſe the diſſenting Cardinals adhered; who inſtigating <hi>Lewis</hi> every day againſt the Pope, and raiſing tumults in ſeveral places, gave out a report, that the Abbot of <hi>Clugni</hi> was to be created Pope in the place of <hi>Julio</hi>; the which extremely incenſed and moved him with choler, and diſdain, for he had a mind always unquiet; not ſooner end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one enterprize, before he began another; his Plots and deſigns al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways increaſing.<note place="margin">Guicciardin, lib. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> He determined now at the beginning of the Spring to attempt <hi>Ferrara,</hi> a deſign ſo much deſired: He had bought the City of <hi>Siena</hi> for thirty thouſand Ducats. He agreed to lend the Emperor forty thouſand Ducats, receiving <hi>Modena</hi> in pawn. He threatned <hi>Luca</hi> for ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <hi>Garſagnana.</hi> He teſtified ſome anger againſt the Cardinal <hi>de Medicis,</hi> becauſe he ſeemed more inclining to the Party of the Catholick King than to his; and ſtudied new Plots and Practices to alter the Eſtate of <hi>Florence.</hi> And in this manner having a thouſand irons in the fire, he was continually plotting how he might drive the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army out of <hi>Italy</hi> by the help of the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> whom he always extolled, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; it being his great deſign, as he often uttered, to expel all Forein Force out of <hi>Italy.</hi> He had alſo moved <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. King of <hi>England</hi> to make War upon <hi>France,</hi> and in deteſtation of <hi>Lewis,</hi> he had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by a publick Decree of the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> the Title of <hi>Moſt Chriſtian</hi> to the King of <hi>England,</hi> for which there was a Bull prepared, and written, containing alſo in the ſame, a deprivation, and depoſing of the King of <hi>France</hi> from all his Power and Dignities, giving that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for a prey to any who could conquer it. With theſe great thoughts, and perhaps many other more ſecret intrigues, he fell ſick of a violent Fever, cauſed perhaps by the violent agitations of his mind; and in a few days died in the <hi>Vatican,</hi>

At the age of 13 years he was made a Cardinal by <hi>Innocent</hi> VIII. and now was about the age of 37 years, when he was created Pope; a thing rare, and unuſual to have a Pope ſo young, and which had not otherwiſe been practicable but by the concurrence of the young Cardinals, ſuch as the Cardinal of <hi>Aragon, Gonzaga, Cornaro, Petrucci,</hi> &amp;c. the Conclave before they came to this Election, propoſed, and with many warm Debates conſidered of the ways, how the Secular Power which the late Popes had exerciſed in a diſorderly manner, ſacrificing all to their luſt and ambition, might be reſtrained within ſome limits, and bounds of moderation: but thoſe rules, and terms agreed upon, were ſpeedily relaxed, and diſpenſed with, ſo ſoon, as a new Lord or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor appeared, whom every one courted, being deſirous with humble ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequiouſneſs to gratifie; and freeing him from all the clogs, and limits to his power, endeavoured to teſtifie the confidence they had in him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus choſen on the 11th. of <hi>March,</hi> he was crowned on the 19th. and on the 11th. of <hi>April</hi> following, in a moſt pompous, and ſolemn manner he went to viſit the Church of S. <hi>John Lateran,</hi> and with ſuch magnificence, and State, as was never equalled by former Popes.</p>
               <p>The world conceived great joy, and expectations of good at the firſt news of his Election; for being a perſon of unſpotted Chaſtity, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Piety, and unblemiſhed in his manners; and the Papal Dignity obtained fairly by him without Simony, Corruption, or evil Arts, it was reaſonable to expect, and preſage from ſuch happy beginnings, times of more calmneſs, and bleſſings to the Church, than under the turbulent Reigns of the two former Popes.</p>
               <p>The exiled Cardinals, (of which thoſe of greateſt note were S. <hi>Croia</hi> and S. <hi>Severin</hi>) hearing of the death of <hi>Julius</hi> II. began their Journey towards <hi>Rome</hi>; and being landed at <hi>Livorn,</hi> they went to <hi>Piſa,</hi> and thence had ſafe conduct to <hi>Florence.</hi> The Pope having received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their arrival in that City, ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Orvietto</hi> to adviſe them not to proceed farther, until ſuch time, as it ſhould be determined in what manner they ſhould be received at <hi>Rome.</hi> For conſidering they had been judicially deprived, and their deprivation confirmed in the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> that they ſhould forbear to go in the habit of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, but preſent, and offer themſelves in ſome other modeſt, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential

               <p>And now <hi>Leo</hi> being ſetled in the Papal Chair, ſhewed himſelf deſirous to continue, and conſerve the Peace of Chriſtendom, which he thought would be moſt eaſily effected by perſuading the warlike and martial ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of thoſe times to ſpend their fury upon the Turk, and in the mean time endeavoured to accommodate, and compoſe the differences between <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor and the <hi>Venetians</hi> touching <hi>Verona,</hi> and <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza</hi> by an amicable agreement.

referred the determination of their caſe to his Arbitration, and compromiſe, a Peace enſued, tho the Sentence and Determination was not Pronounced and Publiſhed until the year following. <hi>Lewis</hi> likewiſe the <hi>French</hi> King, at the perſuaſions and inſtigation of the Clergy, was very deſirous to come in, and be reconciled to the Papal See; and to that end ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> his Embaſſador to <hi>Rome,</hi> to treat, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all matters in diſpute, either relating to Spiritual, or Temporal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. At the arrival of this Embaſſador, the Pope by a Decree of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, which ſtill continued, gave Licence to the Biſhop of <hi>France,</hi> and other Prelates, againſt whom his Predeceſſor Pope <hi>Julius</hi> had proceeded by cenſure of Excommunication to come in, and in the ſpace of one years time to purge themſelves of the contumacy with which they ſtood charged.

The King, ſo ſoon as he entered was immediately conducted into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, where before the Pope by a Speech delivered by his Chancellor, he profeſſed all Obedience to the Papal Chair, and afterwards was lodged three days in the ſame Palace with the Pope, during which time all the ſigns of good will, and amity interceded between them, and all matters agreed which had relation to <hi>Naples, Modena,</hi> and other controverſies: and thus all things being amicably concluded, the King returned to <hi>Milan,</hi> and in a ſhort time after into <hi>France</hi>; leaving the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant in his place: The Pope alſo went to <hi>Florence,</hi> where having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Winter, he in the Spring returned to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now Pope <hi>Leo</hi> being a little at repoſe, deſigned the aſſiſtance of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor (with whom he was in League) to make his Brother <hi>Julian</hi> Lord of <hi>Siena,</hi> and <hi>Lucca,</hi> and thereunto to adjoyn the Dukedoms of <hi>

And now to prepare a way for taking the Dutchy of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> from <hi>Franciſco Maria de la Rovere,</hi> the Pope began with his Church Cenſures,<note place="margin">Guicciardin, lib. <hi>12.</hi>

That he had killed the Cardinal of <hi>Pavia,</hi> for which he was alſolved by Grace, and not by Juſtice, as alſo for many other Murders committed by him. Theſe and other were the Crimes, which were alledged againſt him; but yet nothing animated the Pope ſo much with anger, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain againſt him, as that he had denied unto his Brother <hi>Julian</hi> his aid, and aſſiſtance to return to <hi>Florence.</hi> The ſucceſs of the War was this. So ſoon as <hi>Renzo di Cere</hi> the Popes General with a conſiderable Army ſhowed himſelf upon the Frontiers of the Dutchy, the City of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> with other Towns belonging to it, ſurrendred to the Pope, the Duke himſelf retiring to <hi>Peſaro</hi>; which alſo yielded together with <hi>Sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaglia,</hi> and in the ſpace of four days all ſubmitted to the obedience of the Pope; and then the Duke with all his Family ſaved himſelf in <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe ſucceſſes were followed by new deſigns upon <hi>Siena,</hi> from whence by force of Arms he compelled the Prince <hi>Borgheſe,</hi> and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Alfonſo</hi> his Brother, both Sons of <hi>Pandolfo Petrucci</hi> to retire, and make place for <hi>Raphael Petrucci,</hi> his old Friend, and Companion in his Exile: at which the Cardinal was ſo enraged, and excited beyond all patience, that he conſpired againſt the life of the Pope, which not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, proved afterwards the cauſe of his own deſtruction. For this

                  <hi>Alfonſo</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Siena</hi> revolving often in his mind the ingratitude of this Pope, who by the labors and dangers of <hi>Pandolfo Petrucci</hi> his Father,<note place="margin">Guicciardin, lib. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note> was with all his Family reſtored to the Government of <hi>Florence</hi>; and yet had in recompenſe of theſe benefits, cauſed him and his Brother <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſe</hi> to be thruſt out of <hi>Siena</hi>; the which thoughts boiling in his mind, he reſolved once with his own hand to ſtab the Pope; but being diverted from that intention by the danger of the Fact, and by the ill fame of a wickedneſs without example, to have a Pope killed by the hand of a Cardinal, he changed the Plot of the Dagger to Poiſon, which by the help of <hi>Baptiſta Vercelli</hi> a famous Chirurgeon, and his familiar Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he hoped to effect in this manner. The Pope being greatly affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with an old <hi>Fiſtula</hi> in his Fundament, this <hi>Baptiſta</hi> was to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as an able man for this work; and then in dreſſing of the Wound he was to have injected Poiſon into it: but <hi>Baptiſta</hi> being long in getting admiſſion to the Popes privacy, <hi>Alfonſo</hi> grew impatient of delays, and not being able to contain himſelf, continually uttered ſomething of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which gave the Pope juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion, that this <hi>Alfonſo</hi> was practiſing ſomething againſt his life: at length by ſome Letters which were intercepted, the Conſpiracy was detected, which the Pope diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, invited <hi>Alfonſo</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> with promiſes of Reconciliation and Preferment; and for his encouragement thereunto, he gave him Letters of ſafe conduct, and his promiſe to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador not to violate the ſame. But ſo ſoon as <hi>Alfonſo</hi> arrived, the Pope ſo little eſteemed the Faith he had given, that he cauſed him to be Arreſted, with his Friend Cardinal <hi>De Sauli,</hi> a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> one ſo familiar and intimate with him, that it was believed, that one could not be guilty, or deſigning any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without the privity, and conſent of the other.

                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador complained of the breach of Faith, which being given to the Kings Embaſſador, ought to have been obſerved with the ſame ſacred fidelity, as given to the King himſelf. Whereunto the Pope made anſwer, that in matters of a Conſpiracy, deſigning againſt the life of the Pope, no ſafe conduct was ſufficient, unleſs in ſome clauſe of it, the Crime it, ſelf had been ſpecified with a peculiar <hi>Proviſo</hi>; and that in caſes of Poiſoning, which is deteſtable to God and man, no ſufficient proviſion can be made for ſecurity of the Offender, unleſs the Crime it ſelf be firſt mentioned, and pardoned.

Nor was <hi>Italy</hi> free from the like fears of Invaſion by that Potent Prince, which had under meaner circumſtances of power entered the City of <hi>Otranto,</hi> and put all <hi>Italy</hi> into a fear and conſternation: And therefore now to obviate, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like dangers at a diſtance, the Pope cauſed moſt devout Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with the ſolemn Pomp of Images, and Relicks of Saints to be made at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in perſon walked bare-foot with all his Court from S. <hi>Peters</hi> to the <hi>Minerva,</hi> where Prayers were made to God, that he would be pleaſed to divert the fury of this Common Enemy to Chriſtendom. And becauſe Prayers without human endeavours are not available, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were wrote to all Chriſtian Princes to joyn in this War; for the more orderly management of which, the task, and enterpriſe which every one was to undertake, was allotted, and contrived in the Conſiſtory, and an Univerſal Truce for five years was publiſhed amongſt all Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and States, with grievous cenſures on thoſe, who ſhould be repugnant thereunto.

over-ruling the zeal for Religion, and the Univerſal Union, the minds of the Princes became ſlackned in the deſign, and the thoughts of War va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; every one looking at the peril as uncertain, and far diſtant.</p>
               <p>The Peace ſtill continuing in <hi>Italy</hi> until the year 1520. <hi>Martin Luther</hi> a Frier of the Order of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> began to make ſome diſturbances in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> which greatly oppoſed the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; The beginnings thereof had their original from certain Indulgences which Pope <hi>Leo</hi> exerciſed in a more ample, and licentious manner than was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed and practiſed by former Popes. For in the year 1100. being in the Reign of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> II. Plenary Indulgences for Pardon and Remiſſion of Sins were beſtowed on thoſe only who went to the Holy War with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to deliver the Sepulchre of Chriſt out of the hands of Infidels. Theſe Indulgences were afterwards in like manner diſpenſed unto thoſe, who either were not able, or willing to undertake the deſign in perſon, provided that they entertained or payed another at their own charge. Afterwards Indulgences and Pardons of this nature became more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, being enlarged to thoſe who took part in the Wars againſt thoſe who reſiſted the Secular Arms of the Pope; tho the ſame were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Princes, who in defence of their own Kingdoms, and States, oppoſed the Encroachments and Extravagancies of the Eccleſiaſtical Claims. But now Pope <hi>Leo</hi> by the Counſel of Cardinal <hi>Puccio</hi> beſtowed his Indulgences in more ample form, and diſperſed them in all parts of the Chriſtian World, without diſtinction of times, perſons, or places, not only for the help of ſuch, who were yet living, but with power to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſouls of the Dead from the pains of Purgatory; it being manifeſtly known, that the deſign of theſe Indulgences was only to obtain money from the people, which the Collectors exacted with an unparallel'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, the matter became ſcandalous, eſpecially in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Officers ſet the Indulgences to ſale at a ſmall price; and ſometimes in a Tavern this power of redeeming Souls out of Purgatory were ſet for a Stake at a Game at Tables. This ſhame, and diſhonor was increaſed in the Country of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> when it was known, that the proceed, and benefit of thoſe Indulgences, extorted with great rigor and avarice by the Biſhop of <hi>Arembauld,</hi> (a man fit to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch a Commiſſion) was not to be paid in to the Apoſtolical Chamber at <hi>Rome,</hi> but given to <hi>Magdalen,</hi> Siſter to the Pope, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the avarice of a Woman; for then the matter became deteſtable, and the cries and exclamations lowed in all parts of <hi>Germany. Luther</hi> being ſupported by the favour of the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> took this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to contemn theſe Indulgences, and preach every where againſt them, which being a matter very plauſible, his Sermons were heard with great attention by the people, and his Doctrin approved by his Auditors, who came from all parts to hear him: Having this encouragement, he began to queſtion the Power of the Church, and the Authority of the Pope; and as matters grew higher, he diſputed againſt Pardons, and Penance, and Purgatory, upon which the Doctrin of Indulgences had its foundation: on the truth of which Doctrins, he laid ſo much ſtreſs, and was ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive in the certainty of all his Concluſions, that he would often ſay, he would not refer or ſubmit them to the judgment of Angels.

and ſubtil Wits of that Age; <hi>Luther</hi> proceeded to preach againſt Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in Churches, againſt Prayers to Saints, to queſtion Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Holy Euchariſt, and to allow Marriage to Prieſts, Monks, and Friers, the which he not only maintained by force of Argument, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by his own example, The Pope in oppoſition hereunto ſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Religious, and learned men into <hi>Germany</hi> to hinder (if poſſible) by their Preaching, and Diſputations the farther ſpreading of theſe Doctrins: The Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth in a Diet at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> made a publick, and ſolemn Edict againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and his Concluſions; the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> condemned them; and the King of <hi>England, Henry</hi> VIII. wrote a Book againſt them, for which he afterwards received from this Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> the Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith.</hi> But <hi>Luther</hi> being a man of great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and ſupported by the favour of the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> little regarded either the Arguments of the School-men, or the Authority of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; ſaying, That the Prophet forbad to truſt in men, or Princes, before whoſe judgment, the Word of God, and the ſentence of Scripture was to be preferred. Theſe diſturbances in <hi>Germany</hi> were followed by the like in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> where <hi>Zuinglius</hi> by force of Argument diſputed in favour of the Doctrin of <hi>Luther</hi>; which cauſed ſuch confuſions, and diſcord, that for the ſettlement, and quiet thereof the Senate of <hi>Zurich,</hi> convened all the Preachers and Doctors of their Country, and requeſted the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtance</hi> to depute ſuch wiſe, and learned perſons, (as he ſhould think fit) to aſſiſt at this Conference, for determination of the matters in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: Great numbers of people being aſſembled at this Convocation, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> propoſed his Theſis, and all the points in diſpute, and offered to anſwer the Arguments of any Opponent, which ſhould be ſet up againſt him. <hi>Peter Faber</hi> a man holy in his life, and of profound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having heard, and weighed all the ſtrength of Argument which the <hi>Jacobins,</hi> and others had alledged, refuſed as Moderator in thoſe Controverſies to determin any thing in thoſe matters, which more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonged to the cognizance of that General Council, which was ſhortly by Authority of the Pope, and the conſent of all the Chriſtian Princes, to meet, and aſſemble, conſiſting of all the Prelates of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. This Sentence gave <hi>Zuinglius</hi> advantage to advance his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, and ſay, that theſe were but delays to amuſe the people, and lull them in their ignorance; that doubtful matters were proper to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and diſcuſſed, and determined by the Authority of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils; but that matters certain, and clear by Scripture, which was the Word of God, and the rule of our lives, and confirmed by the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians, ſtood in need of no other Authority, than their own plain evidence to confirm them. In fine, the Aſſembly broke up, and the Senate concluded with this reſult, that the Goſpel ſhould be Preached according to the Canon of the Old and new Teſtament, and not according to the Decrees, and Conſtitutions of men.</p>
               <p>This matter began daily in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſeem of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, fearing leſt it ſhould greatly ſhake the Power of the Popes, and abate the profits of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and diſcompoſe the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Chriſtian Religion; for which occaſion, many Conſiſtories were ſummoned at <hi>Rome,</hi> and many Conſultations held in the Chamber of the Pope amongſt the Cardinals and Divines, for remedy of this growing evil. The Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> were at theſe Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50681:246"/>
condemned, and Excommunications thundered out againſt them with moſt grievous Anathemaes, the which ſerved only to exaſperate the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and cauſed him to become a more ſevere and vehement Protector of that Cauſe; which began now to dilate and ſpread more diffuſely amongſt the people, by how much the more it was perſecuted by vigorous, and violent courſes. At length the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as other People, and Nations, did conclude, that the only means to quiet mens minds, and ſettle them in a true Belief and Faith, was to eſtabliſh all doubts and Controverſies by the Authority of a General Council: the which was deſired by Princes, and Lords of Countries, in hopes that thereby the diſorderly lives of Prieſts and Friers would be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reduced to their Primitive Conſtitutions; and that the <hi>Regalia</hi> and Temporal Juriſdictions, which had long been uſurped by the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Power, would at length be reſtored to the Secular Dignity of Princes. But to reduce matters to this eſtate, they did not judg it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that Eccleſiaſticks ſhould be the ſole Members to compoſe ſuch an Aſſembly, whoſe intereſt it was to maintain their own Corruptions, and determin all matters in favour of themſelves againſt the Rights and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of Chriſtian Princes; in whoſe Affairs their conſents and Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ought to be conſulted. The common people alſo, who had ſome competent knowledg in the Affairs of the world, were deſirous of a Council, in hopes, and expectation, that the libidinous Power of the Church, which had for a long time tyrannized over them, might at length be limited, and moderated; and that the Exactions which were charged upon them, under the ſpecious pretences of Alms, and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, might not be forced, and diſtrained by the violence, and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Epiſcopal Officers. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> did likewiſe deſire a Council, in hopes the Authority of the Church, which began to be ſhaken by the oppoſition of Adverſaries, and the encroachments which Princes made on its Juriſdiction, might thereby be confirmed: but they were for having it regulated according to the practices of modern times, which ſhould not touch on the preſent Abuſes and evil cuſtoms introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in favour of the Papal Power; but ſuch an one as was called by the preceding Pope, and Aſſembled at the <hi>Lateran,</hi> which had produced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny happy and advantageous ſucceſſes; for it had extinguiſhed the Schiſms of the Cardinals, reduced the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> which before was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, to an Union, and aboliſhed that Sanction which highly entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on the Temporal and Spiritual Monarchy of <hi>Rome</hi>: and laſtly had conferred the collation of Benefices on the Pope, which was the great foundation of the Papal Grandeur. Howſoever Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſtill doubted, that this remedy was not entirely adapted to the nature of this evil: for tho the power of a Council might have an influence over Princes, and great Prelates, againſt whom their Decrees, and Determinations might avail, yet could not reach the minds of the common people, or produce that real alteration, and change, which was neceſſary for the quiet, and ſettlement of the Eccleſiaſtical State. In this condition of affairs <hi>Leo</hi> died, about the end of the year 1521.</p>
               <p>But theſe Diviſions and Diſſentions in Spiritual Controverſies did not only diſquiet the Pope; but likewiſe the Plots of certain Cardinals which deſigned againſt his Life and Government; of which a diſcovery being made, ſeveral of them were deprived of their Hats, and Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50681:246"/>
Benefices: and <hi>Alfonſo Petrucci</hi> being chief in the number of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, was taken, and ſtrangled by a Negro Slave in the Caſtle of St. <hi>Angelo</hi> at <hi>Rome. Adrian da Cornetro</hi> being fled, and eſcaped from Juſtice, was for ever without hopes of Reſtauration deprived of the Character and Honor of Cardinal. <hi>Raphael Riario,</hi> and <hi>Bendinello Sauli</hi> were ſuſpended, but afterwards reſtored to the Dignity of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals. <hi>Saderini</hi> was condemned to live in perpetual baniſhment. Thus by the puniſhment and degradation of ſeveral Cardinals, the College be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wanting and unprovided of its due numbers; the Pope with much liberality created one and thirty at one time; all perſons of quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to ſeveral Countries of Chriſtendom; ſome of which were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced for their Virtue and Merit, and others by the Favour and Intereſt of great Perſonages. This Pope created two and forty Cardinals in all during the time of his Reign, beſides the reſtauration of the four rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Cardinals deprived by <hi>Julio</hi>; amongſt theſe Cardinals which he had ordained, <hi>Julio de Medici</hi> his Kinſman was one, whom he made his Vice-Chancellor, and was afterwards Pope under the name of <hi>Clement</hi> VII.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor dying, <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Spain, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> was elected to the great regret, and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who with much envy and emulation was diſpleaſed to ſee the Imperial Dignity added to the many Kingdoms, and Eſtates holden by the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> And becauſe according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rule and Canon the King of <hi>Naples</hi> was excluded from all capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of being Emperor; a Diſpenſation was purchaſed from the Pope, with expence of 7000 Ducats, qualifying the King of <hi>Naples</hi> for the Election. Afterwards the Pope having favoured the cauſe of <hi>Charles,</hi> and he by his aſſiſtance being Elected Emperor, an Alliance, and League was agreed between them to drive the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> a deſign ever pleaſing to the Popes; and particularly to <hi>Leo,</hi> who was impatient of the infamous loſs of <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> which being gained with ſo much glory and trouble by <hi>Julio,</hi> he hoped to regain and reſtore to the Poſſeſſions of the Church. In purſuance of this enterprize, a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Army of <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Switzers</hi> were ſent by the Emperor into <hi>Italy,</hi> and joyned with the Forces of the Pope. <hi>Proſpero Colonna</hi> was made Generaliſſimo, and <hi>Frederico Gonzaga</hi> of <hi>Mantoua</hi> General of the Army of the Church, and <hi>Julio de Medici</hi> Legate of the whole Army. The ſucceſs proved agreeable to the preparations, for the <hi>French</hi> were droven out of <hi>Italy,</hi> which had long groaned under their pride and tyranny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after which <hi>Milan</hi> was according to Articles ſurrendred into the hands of <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> the true and natural Lord, and <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> reſtored to the Church; with the news of which, the Pope conceived ſuch extremity of joy, that he died ſuddenly on the firſt of <hi>December</hi> 1521. at the Village of <hi>Magliana,</hi> where he uſed often for recreation to retire himſelf, from whence the next day his body was removed to <hi>Rome</hi>; not without ſuſpicion of having been poiſoned by his Chamberlain <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus died <hi>Leo</hi> X. at the age of 45 years, 11 months, and one day, having held the Papal Chair for the ſpace of eight years and twenty days; having at the hour of his death

teſtified the great ſatisfaction he received by the reſtitution of <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> to the Eccleſiaſtical State, without the effuſion of the leaſt drop of blood.</p>
               <p>This Pope was eſteemed a great lover of Juſtice, having been ſevere againſt Thieves and Robbers. He was a great lover of his Recreation, and Pleaſures, ſpending much time in Hunting, and Banquets; and was more delighted with Muſick, than became the gravity and ſeverity of a Pope. He was highly magnificent in his Buildings, and munificent in his gifts, with which and by his Wars he had conſumed ſo profuſely beyond his Revenue, that for maintenance of this charge he was forced to exact mony for making Cardinals, and to ſet ſeveral Offices of his Court to ſale. He was a great lover of Learning, and learned men, to whom he was very liberal in his gifts, imitating therein the ſpirit of his Father <hi>Laurence de Medicis.</hi> He enlarged the Power of the <hi>Poteſta,</hi> or Civil Magiſtracy of <hi>Rome,</hi> and beſtowed on them ſeveral Privileges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities; for which reaſon by a Solemn Decree they made <hi>Julian</hi> his Brother a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> and treated him at the <hi>Campidoglio</hi> with Feaſting, and other Entertainments; where they alſo erected a Statue of Marble, and dedicated it to <hi>Leo,</hi> with this Inſcription, <hi>Optimo Principi Leoni X.

               <p>Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> being now ſeated in his Throne, employed his whole time at firſt to hear, and underſtand the Affairs of <hi>Rome,</hi> for as yet he was altogether ignorant of the State of <hi>Italy</hi>; the which in ſuch an exigency, in which things at that time were, was a great trouble to conſidering men, who thought it a miſerable diſadvantage to have at that time a Pope a ſtranger, and altogether unexperienced in the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> and of the Court; when the Peſtilence grievouſly afflicted the City, a matter which was interpreted for an ill Prognoſtication, and <hi>omen</hi> of his future ſucceſs: The Treaſury alſo by the Wars, Diſorders, and Luxury of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Popes exhauſted, and drained to a farthing; and all the Jewels, and Ornaments of the Pontifical Dignity pawned, and placed in the hands of Uſurers, firſt by <hi>Leo,</hi> and afterwards more monies raiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the College, to ſupply the neceſſities, and exigencies of the Church. <hi>Arimino</hi> alſo was ſeized and poſſeſſed by <hi>Sigiſmund Malateſta.</hi> And news was come that <hi>Soliman</hi> the Great Turk had inveſted <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and put it into great danger, and prepared with a great Army to invade <hi>Hungary:</hi> all which being matters of great difficulty, did much puzzle and diſtract the mind of <hi>Adrian,</hi> who was as yet raw and unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Affairs of <hi>Rome:</hi> the which troubles were ſoon followed by the unhappy news of the loſs of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> having been ſurrendred up on conditions after a ſix months Siege.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50681:248"/>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the memory of Pope <hi>Julian</hi> was ſtill ſo precious, as to entitle him to ſome kindneſs from this preſent Pope; on which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, which were iſſued out againſt him by <hi>Leo</hi> were reverſed, Plenary Abſolution given him, and he again reſtored to the Dutchy of <hi>

               <p>With the like frank generoſity <hi>Adrian</hi> received <hi>Alfonſo</hi> Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> into his favour; and not only inveſted him in the Dukedom of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> and in all thoſe Lands which depended on the Church before the War which Pope <hi>Leo</hi>

               <p>After theſe Affairs the Pope re-aſſumed the thoughts ſo often medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by his Predeceſſors, of driving the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> the which was alſo greatly deſired by the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> on ſuppoſition that the matter was practicable and eaſie in caſe they could induce the <hi>Venetians</hi> to ſeparate from the <hi>French</hi> King: to incline them hereunto, Embaſſadors were diſpatched from the Emperor, and the King of <hi>England</hi> (who at the ſame time ſent a Herald to denounce War againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, in caſe he would not make a Truce with the Emperor in all parts of the world for three years) in which alſo the Pope, the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the <hi>Florentines</hi> were to be comprehended. The pretence of this Truce was grounded on agreement of all Chriſtian Princes to turn their Forces againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> who was now grown formidable in <hi>Hungary,</hi> to which place Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> war ſent his Legate with a ſupply of fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns to carry on that War. But this deſign was diſappointed by a diſcovery made by ſome Letters intercepted by Cardinal <hi>Julio de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi> wrote from <hi>Francis Soderino</hi> one of the old Cardinals, and much truſted by the Pope in all his ſecrets, to <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>France</hi>; wherein he perſuaded him to invade the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi> laying down the Plot, and Deſign as eaſie, and hopeful. The Pope being greatly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and enraged againſt <hi>Soderino,</hi> who was Cardinal of <hi>Volterra,</hi> for this perfidious diſturbance of the quiet of <hi>Italy,</hi> and diſappointment of the Holy War, greatly inveighed againſt him in a full Aſſembly of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and afterwards committed him Priſoner to the Caſtle. <hi>Soderino</hi>'s Letters were then produced and read, being full of reflections on the Pope; ſaying, That he was a perſon to whom no Faith, or Credence could be given; for tho he pretended the quiet and peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the benefit of the Church, yet he deſigned it no farther than was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the advancement of his own <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, to whoſe concernmentr all other conſiderations were to yield and give place: The
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50681:249"/>
Pope took meaſures of the affections of all the other Cardinals by this character which <hi>Soderino</hi> had given of him, and believing them to be all of the ſame humor, entertained a like jealouſie and ſuſpicion of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in general; ſo that he made Confidents of none but of ſuch men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as were of his own Country: his Secretaries that were moſt intimate with him, and privy to all his deſigns and ſecrets, were <hi>William Eiken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort,</hi> whom he had made Chief Datary, and Biſhop of <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> and the only Cardinal created by him, and <hi>Theodorick Hetius,</hi> both <hi>Dutch-men,</hi> and <hi>John Rufus,</hi> who had been his old Acquaintants and Creatures, by whoſe counſels, and advice he contrived and acted all matters which had relation to the Government; and ſeldom communicated his Counſels and deſigns to the College, but only to his <hi>Dutch-men,</hi> whom he often prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for their ſincere and real intentions, without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This ill corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence between the Pope, and his Cardinals was augmented by the offence he gave to the College, by diſanulling all the Acts and Ordinances they had made, during the vacancy of the See, and before he came to <hi>Rome</hi>; which being made in favour to themſelves, and for their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, he made void for the greater good, and emolument of the Church, revoking and taking into his hands thoſe Benefices which the Cardinals had out of favour, and courteſie voted and beſtowed on each other: and ſuch Offices as Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth had conferred on able and good men, in reward of their Learning, and Virtue, he took away to raiſe mony, wherewith to ſupply, and ſatisfie the urgent neceſſities of the Church. This manner of proceeding added to the fuel of the laſt diſcontents made <hi>Adrian</hi> appear not only diſtruſtful, but covetous in a high degree, and every day ſeem more odious, and weariſome to the Clergy and Grandees of <hi>Rome</hi>: of which the Pope being ſenſible, would often ſay, that the happy conjuncture of Affairs was greatly conducing to a Prince, who deſired to illuſtrate his Virtues, and Actions to the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: witneſs the happy ſtate of affairs in the time of the late Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> which were ſo flouriſhing and chearful, that they ſeemed to be the golden days, which afterwards by that licentiouſneſs which was crept into <hi>Rome,</hi> during the long vacancy of the Sea, and abſence of this Pope, were changed, and altered by a total corruption of manners: to which a contagion of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence ſupervening, joyned with Famine, and War, which greatly afflicted <hi>Italy</hi>; the miſeries of men cauſed them to retort their remembrances on the late more chearful days of <hi>Leo,</hi> and by ſuch unreaſonable compariſons to paſs a judgment between the Wiſdom and Worth of <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi>; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the unavoidable miſeries of thoſe times, a matter and ſubject of <hi>odium</hi> and deteſtation of the preſent Pope; tho in reality he was a perſon of a ſevere life, of great temperance, and deſirous to reform abuſes, which were crept into the Church; and correct, and ſeverely chaſtiſe the diſſolute manners in the City, ſuch as Simony, Extortion, and Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; to which end he called to his aſſiſtance <hi>Caraffa,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Chieti,</hi> and <hi>Marcello Gazella</hi> of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> both perſons of gravity and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and of ſingular Wiſdom and Learning; with whom he conſulted touching a reformation of manners, and amendment of abuſes: and to ſet by his own example rules of moderation and temperance, he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extremely ſevere towards his own Relations and Kindred: an inſtance whereof he gave in his deportment towards a Couſin of his, whom he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50681:249"/>
having ſetled in his Studies at <hi>Siena,</hi> came one time from thence to <hi>Rom,</hi> without the order or command of the Pope; at which he conceived ſo much anger, that he preſently returned him back again on a hired Horſe, reproving and telling him, that he ſhould learn modeſty, and temperance by his example: ſeveral Relations alſo of his being in a mean condition, travelled afoot through <hi>Germany,</hi> and came to <hi>Rome</hi> in expectation of ariſing to ſome conſiderable Preferments: but he diſappointed them of their hopes, and returned them back again with no greater largeſs, than a plain Suit of Cloth to each, and with ſo much mony as might ſerve to bear their charges and expences back into their own Country. And in this manner whilſt <hi>Adrian</hi> was intent to introduce honeſty of life, and manners into the world, and bring Virtue into faſhion; and employed in perfecting the League and Confederacy between the Emperor and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and other Allies, in order to the main deſign of expelling the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy:</hi> It happened that he was ſeized by a Fever, which affecting him at firſt in a gentle manner, was lightly eſteemed by the Phyſicians, but the diſeaſe afterwards increaſing, he ſummoned the College of Cardinals to him, recommending to them the care of the Church, and the welfare of Chriſtendom. He beſtowed his own Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Hat, with his Title on his great Friend, and Confident <hi>Eikenwort,</hi> in gratitude for his faithful ſervices performed towards him. After which he died in the <hi>Vatican</hi> on the 14th. of <hi>September</hi> 1523, having held the Papal Dignity no longer than one year, eight months, and ſix days; and having lived 64 years. three months, and 13 days, he departed this life, and was buried in the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> with this Epitaph.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſino</hi> bore to him on account of that ancient hatred and quarrel which was hereditary between the two Families, who therefore oppoſed him with all his power and intereſt: And farther upon promiſe given by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſino</hi> to confer on him the Office of Vice-Chancellor: the conteſt was no longer doubtful, every one preſſing to give his voice that he might not ſeem the laſt to appear in favour of <hi>Medici:</hi> by which means two thirds giving their ſuffrages for him (which is neceſſary to the Election of every Pope) an end was put to this Controverſie which had laſted two months and four days. Thus <hi>Julio Medici</hi> being declared Pope, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by all the Cardinals, together with great numbers of Prelates, and Clergy-men to the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> where being ſeated upon the High-Altar <hi>ad limina Apoſtolorum,</hi> he was there worſhipped, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced by all the Clergy, who preſented themſelves before him to pay him rheir reſpects, and obedience, and receive his bleſſing. He there took upon himſelf the name of <hi>Clement</hi> VII. and was afterwards condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and attended with a numerous train to his Lodgings in the <hi>Vatican.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Julio,</hi> now <hi>Clement</hi> VII. was the natural Son of <hi>Juliano de Medici,</hi> who was murdered by the <hi>Pazzi,</hi> and other Conſpirators, as before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the life of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. He was born a month after the death of his Father, whom he greatly reſembling in all the lineaments of his face, and vivacity of his ſpirit, was committed to the charge and care of his Uncle <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> who educated him in all ſorts of Liberal Sciences, and elegancy of manners, which might ſerve to render a perſon of his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and condition accompliſhed. His Family being afterwards expelled out of <hi>Florence</hi> by the power of <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, King of <hi>France,</hi> he continued in exile from his own Country for the ſpace of 18 years; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, he was created Knight of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and Grand Prior of <hi>Capua</hi>: and afterwards advanced by his Kinſman <hi>Leo</hi> X. to the Arch-Biſhoprick
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50681:250"/>
of <hi>Florence,</hi> and the year following was created Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of S. <hi>Clement,</hi> and then inſtituted Chancellor of the Roman Church, which is the ſupreme Office in the Popes Court: and laſtly, being aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the high dignity of Pope, he was crowned on the 25th. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> 1523. with the common joy, and ſatisfaction of all in general, who were pleaſed with the promotion of a perſon of his great Authority and Sobriety, wholly addicted to buſineſs, and counſel, without mixtures of pleaſures, or divertiſements; for which reaſon the world expected great and extraordinary matters from him.</p>
               <p>Howſoever all theſe excellencies in a perſon of his high condition could not hinder or prevent the evils of an inſuing War: nor could the Pope, when the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King ſent their Embaſſadors to <hi>Rome</hi> to complement him upon his late Election, pleaſe them both, by keeping that even hand of moderation and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which became his Office, when Chriſtian Princes are at variance: for the Emperor expected the ſame ſtrictneſs of Alliance as was between him, and Pope <hi>Leo</hi> his Predeceſſor, and challenged his favour and partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity on his ſide, for being aſſiſtant and inſtrumental in his promotion: Howſoever the Election of a perſon of his Authority and Intereſt had a conſiderable Aſcendant over the Affairs of the Church: For the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who during the vacancy of the Sea, had ſeized upon <hi>Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> having underſtood that a Pope of ſo much reputation in the world was Elected, deſiſted from proſecution of his deſign of taking <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and ſo retired peaceably to <hi>Ferrara:</hi> and <hi>John de Saſſatello,</hi> who had for ſome time vexed, and haraſſed <hi>Romagna,</hi> from whence he had been expulſed by the <hi>Gibelines,</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Adrian,</hi> did now retire with his contrary Faction of <hi>Guelfs,</hi> being appeaſed by the Authority and influence of this new Pope.</p>
               <p>But the ſpirits of mightier and more puiſſant Princes were not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily allayed by the charms of mediation, or the force of reaſon; for tho <hi>Clement</hi> being deſirous of the repoſe, and quiet of <hi>Italy,</hi> propoſed to <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King in behalf of the Vice-King of <hi>Naples,</hi> a Truce for five years, with condition, that during that time he ſhould quietly enjoy all the Country on the other ſide of the River <hi>Adda,</hi> the Town of <hi>Loda</hi> only excepted: yet he could not prevail, the <hi>French</hi> King refuſing this fair offer, which afterwards turned to his great misfortune. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope finding the difficulty, or impoſſibility almoſt of making this Peace, he remained doubtful to which of theſe two Princes it was moſt to the intereſt of the Church, and ſecurity of <hi>Italy</hi> for him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, in which ſuſpenſe the Count <hi>Carpy</hi> arriving at <hi>Rome</hi> with chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Embaſſador from the King of <hi>France,</hi> ſo well mannaged his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, that he perſuaded the Pope to lay aſide, and forget thoſe ancient diſcontents and animoſities, which aroſe between his Maſter the King, and Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th. his Kinſman, and to enter into a firm Alliance with him, as the moſt ſecure, and wholeſome means to preſerve the quiet of <hi>Italy.

But the Duke of <hi>Albania</hi> without attending an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,<note place="margin">Onuf.

In fine, he exhorted both Parties to a Peace, and in order thereunto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſeveral expedients for accommodation; but nothing prevailed: the Duke of <hi>Albania</hi> continuing his march, and the King the Siege of <hi>Pavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the Imperialiſts drawing near to the relief of <hi>Pavia,</hi> the treaties and practices of Princes, and the endeavours and ſtudies of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors availed little; all the difficulties and dangers of many months being reduced to the fortune and ſucceſs of a few hours. In ſhort, the Battel of <hi>Pavia</hi> was fought on the 24. of <hi>February,</hi> 1525. in which the <hi>French</hi> Army was entirely defeated, and the King himſelf taken Priſoner; and all the flower of the Nobility of <hi>France</hi> either ſlain or taken: of which the Duke of <hi>Albania</hi> having received intelligence, he raiſed his Camp from <hi>Monte Rotondo</hi> near <hi>Aquila,</hi> where he was lodged, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>France</hi>; but the greateſt part of this Soldiery being compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of <hi>Italians,</hi> and <hi>Corſicans,</hi> returning to <hi>Rome,</hi> were for the moſt part rifled and pillaged in their way by the people of <hi>Campagna,</hi> who were Subjects to the Prince <hi>Colonna,</hi> and by ſome Imperialiſts who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed the ways for them, killing them within the very Walls of <hi>Rome</hi>; to which place they fled for ſanctuary. All the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Pope, being extremely affected with this unexpected ſucceſs, obtained by the Imperial Forces, conducted chiefly by the valour, and wiſdom of the Marqueſs of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> remained doubtful in what manner to govern, and mannage their affairs: for the ballance being now no longer in an equality, but carried down with too much weight on the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50681:251"/>
ſide of the Emperor, his Captains were elevated with this Victory, that they became inſolent beyond all human ſufferance, ſeeming to aſpire to an univerſal Monarchy: the which inſolences were alſo rendered more intolerable by the complaints brought daily to <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> which Countries the Imperialiſts had expoſed to plunder, and deſolation: and the ſuſpicions and jealouſies of the Pope were increaſed, by the refuſal the Emperor made of reſtoring <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> to his right of the poſſeſſion of <hi>Milan,</hi> whom the Imperialiſts beſieged in the Caſtle, and afterwards baniſhed from the precincts of that Country. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, theſe miſunderſtandings were increaſed for want of a faithful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance on the Emperors ſide with the Pope, who having paid a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſum of mony to <hi>Charles de Lanoia</hi> the Emperors Agent, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to have <hi>Reggio</hi> reſtored to the Popedom, which after the death of <hi>Adrian</hi> had been ſeized by <hi>Alfonſo</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> when theſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions came to be performed, and the ancient League renewed with <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, he diſowned the agreement, leſt thereby the Pope ſhould grow more potent, and enlarge his Dominions, endeavouring to leſſen his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by the loſs of his mony, and excluſion from the poſſeſſion of <hi>Reggio.</hi> All theſe umbrages, and matters of diſpleaſure being revolved in the mind of <hi>Clement,</hi> with extreme melancholy, and deſire of redreſs, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred cauſe ſufficient to him of ill will towards the Emperor, moving in him at the ſame time compaſſion of the unfortunate ſtate of <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, then a Priſoner, in reſpect to whom he ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Piſtoia</hi> to condole with him for his unhappy ſucceſs. Whilſt the Pope meditated on theſe matters with ſome ſort of indignation and fear, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were troubled at the ſame time with the like thoughts, unexpectedly, ſent with many preſſing inſtances to perſuade the Pope to joyn with them in the good cauſe for preventing the total ſervitude of all <hi>Italy</hi>; which they propoſed to effect by a force of ten thouſand <hi>Switzers,</hi> which they might cauſe in a ſhort time to deſcend into <hi>Italy</hi>; which being added to the <hi>Italian</hi> Bands, would be able to make head againſt the Imperial Army; and for their parts they promiſed according to their cuſtom, far greater matters, than they were able to perform: and for farther encouragement hereunto, they repreſented the ſtate of the Imperial Army in <hi>Italy,</hi> to be tumultuous and inclinable to Sedition, having for want of pay ſeized the Artillery, and fortified themſelves in <hi>Pavia.</hi> Farther, it was not to be doubted, but that <hi>Loüiſa</hi> the Queen Mother, and Regent of <hi>France</hi> would concur with theſe Counſels, and be aſſiſtant to this deſign with all the power of that Kingdom. Moreover, it was not to be doubted, but that the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who favoured, and depended on the <hi>French</hi> felicity, would alſo enter into this League; the conjunction of whom was of great importance, conſidering that he was a Prince very rich, his Town of <hi>Ferrara</hi> ſtrong, and furniſhed with all ſtores of Ammunition.</p>
               <p>But the Pope conſidering the difficulty of this enterpriſe, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain concurrence of thoſe many circumſtances which were required to make it ſucceſsful, did for ſome time ſuſpend his reſolution, until the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Capua</hi> who had been his ancient Secretary and Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, brought him ſuch agreeable propoſitions from <hi>Don Carlos de Lanoy,</hi> Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> as gave him aſſurances of an advantageous accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation with the Emperor; for then diſpoſing his mind wholly to the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50681:252"/>
thoughts of peace, he labored to get the <hi>Venetians</hi> comprehended in the ſame terms of accord: but in regard the chief points inſiſted upon by the Imperialiſts were ſums of mony to be paid, their Army already mutining for want of their Arrears, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who judged it a piece of folly and cowardiſe to compound with their enemies on the condition of putting weapons into their hands, abſolutely refuſed any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on ſuch terms; which made well for the Pope, and facilitated his negotiations with the Vice-Roy, who interpreting this refuſal of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> to be an indication of new ſtirs, and commotions, intended againſt the Imperial intereſt in <hi>Italy,</hi> was the more ready to condeſcend to the more eaſie terms with the Pope. In ſhort therefore 25 thouſand Ducats being by the Popes order paid by the <hi>Florentines</hi> to the Marquiſs of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> Chief of the Emperors Forces in <hi>Milan,</hi> a Confederacy was concluded at <hi>Rome</hi> between the Pope and the <hi>Florentines</hi> on the one ſide, and the Emperor on the other, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Pope, and the Emperor ſhould be in a perpetual League, and Alliance, and that the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> ſhould be always defended by the Arms of the Pope, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror with ſuch numbers of men, as ſhould be agreed by a certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, and that the ſame ſhould be poſſeſſed, and governed under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror by <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> particularly nominated in that Capitulation. That the Emperor ſhould take into his protection all the Eſtate which the Church held; and particularly ſhould have a care of the Houſe of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis,</hi> to maintain and preſerve them in all the Dignities and Offices which they hold in that City: to which Treaty the greatneſs of that illuſtrious Family is in ſome meaſure obliged. That the <hi>Florentines</hi> ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently pay to the Emperor a hundred thouſand Ducats more, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of that which they had engaged to contribute to the laſt War, in virtue of that Agreement made with Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> which was not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire until one year after the death of one of the Confederates. That the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> ſhould immediately render to the Church <hi>Reggia, Rubiera,</hi> and other Towns which he had unjuſtly ſeized, and uſurped, during the laſt vacancy of the Papal Sea; of which ſo ſoon as the Pope was poſſeſſed, he was in conſideration thereof to pay unto the Emperor one hundred thouſand Ducats. Laſtly, as to <hi>Modena,</hi> and thoſe Towns, conſideration was to be had, and the matter examined, whether they of right appertained to the Church, or the Emperor, and being found only belonging to the Eccleſiaſtical State, they ſhould be freed from all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and dependance on the Empire. In this manner this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance was concluded and determined, and the deſigns of uniting with <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> which were at firſt laid open as the faireſt game, were now diverted by far different meaſures.</p>
               <p>Matters being thus agreed, and concluded in the year 1525. between the Pope and the Vice-Roy, the Cardinal <hi>Salviati</hi> was ſent to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Court with Character of Legate, for confirmation of the Articles; his reception was very honorable, but in debating of particulars on the Commiſſion, the Vice-Roy, who for the common ſafety and quiet of <hi>Italy,</hi> allowed that the Inveſtiture might be given to the Duke of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> did diſſuade the reſtitution of <hi>Reggia,</hi> and <hi>Rubiera</hi>; which being a ſcruple ſtarted after the Accord, did ill affect the mind of the Pope, and confirmed the opinion he had of the Emperors deſigns, not to endure any increaſe of power and greatneſs in the Church. And farther whilſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50681:252"/>
theſe things were debating, there fell out in <hi>Lombardy</hi> ſeveral events which hindred the Inveſtiture of <hi>Sforza</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and therewith broke all the agreements, and meaſures which were formerly taken; for the Emperor not willing to yield to this Inveſtiture, made pretences of forfeiture thereof by <hi>Sforza,</hi> and earneſtly preſſed the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Caſtle of <hi>Milan:</hi> ſo that now the Pope having no expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Emperor, began to incline again, and be biaſſed on the ſide of <hi>France</hi>; and the other Confederates, knowing that whilſt his ſucceſſes were proſperous, and towering in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Emperor might eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Pope, and oppreſs him at his pleaſure; which he would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do, either out of revenge, or ambition, which is known to be almoſt natural in Emperors, againſt the Pope.</p>
               <p>Wherefore a League and Union being propoſed between the Pope, the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> with hopes alſo that the King of <hi>England</hi> would joyn in it; all things were deſigned and laid down in a regular manner, and form for carrying on the War, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the ſuſpected greatneſs of the Emperor: But this Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> who was of a temper naturally ſlow, and irreſolute, weighing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of theſe matters with his Servants, and Miniſters of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, found them ſo divided, each of them abounding in his own ſence, that belabouring the Pope on all ſides, he became much more perplexed and diſtracted in his thoughts, after, than before his conſultations. The truth was, there were two men of great Authority with him, one <hi>Nicolas Scomberg</hi> a <hi>German,</hi> and <hi>John Matthew Giberto</hi> a <hi>Genoeſe; Scomberg</hi> was much honored, and almoſt feared by the Pope, but <hi>Giberto</hi> was more favoured and beloved: theſe two having been ancient, and intimate friends to him, whilſt he was Cardinal, agreed well together; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Ambition, and different Intereſts put them at variance; for <hi>Scom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> being a <hi>German,</hi> naturally affected the intereſt of the Emperor; but <hi>Giberto</hi> loved no man but the Pope: and tho he had formerly been an enemy to the <hi>French</hi> intereſt, yet now upon the change of Affairs, he ſided with them againſt the Emperor. Thus the Pope being diſtracted between the different Councils of theſe boſom Friends, he that was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in his own nature, ſuffering himſelf to be guided by the laſt advice of different judgments, ſeemed always ſo tottering and wavering, that he rendred himſelf contemptible and ridiculous to all that knew him. The Arguments uſed by <hi>Scomberg</hi> to diſſuade the League, were, that according to obſervation, Leagues and Alliances of ſeveral Princes had ſeldom, or never any good effect; for that the conjunction of the Armies, and the due proviſions for them, do ſeldom arrive in ſeaſon, or at convenient times; that where ſo many minds and opinions are to concur, and divers intereſts are carried on, there diſtruſts, and diſcontentments do eaſily happen: whereby the favour of fortune, and benign occaſions are diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: howſoever at length being over-born by <hi>Giberto,</hi> he inclined to go through with the League, and in company with the other Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to begin a War againſt the Emperor.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King being now at liberty, and holding himſelf not obliged to the terms he had made, encouraged and gave life to the League<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the people of the Dutchy of <hi>Milan</hi> being greatly oppreſſed by the Imperialiſts, were ready on all occaſions to make inſurrections, and mutinies in the City againſt the Soldiery, and Collectors of the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50681:253"/>
Contributions: ſo that the Pope being well ſettled, and confirmed in his opinion of the neceſſity of a War, readily entered into confederacy with the <hi>French</hi> King, and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> making the ſubject and ground of the War to be the re-poſſeſſion of <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> into the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the reſtoring to liberty the Kings Children, which were given for Hoſtages: ſo that the Forces of theſe Princes being united together, a moſt cruel War was again renewed in <hi>Italy</hi>; the ſucceſs of which in ſhort was this: <hi>Lodi</hi> was at the beginning of all taken, and then the Confederate Forces joyning with the <hi>Switzers,</hi> took alſo <hi>Cremona,</hi> and beſieging the Caſtle of <hi>Milan,</hi> forced it to ſurrender upon Articles, and then reſigned it into the poſſeſſion of <hi>Sforza</hi>; the Pope alſo ſending ſome Forces againſt <hi>Arimino,</hi> which was ſeized and poſſeſſed by <hi>Sigiſmondo Malateſta,</hi> he recovered the City, and expelled the Uſurper: but all theſe ſucceſſes received ſome alloys, by the ill news arrived from the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who being overcome, and ſlain in battel, the City of <hi>Buda</hi> yielded to the <hi>Turk</hi>; the which being grievouſly reſented by the Pope, he called the Cardinals into the Conſiſtory, where having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the great ignominy and damage to the Chriſtian Cauſe by this late diſgrace, he with great gravity propoſed, that for the common good of Chriſtendom it was neceſſary to ſurceaſe the Wars in <hi>Italy</hi>; and that in order thereunto, laying aſide all the conſiderations of incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, danger, and dignity of his perſon, he reſolved to meet the Chriſtian Princes in ſome convenient place, where he would with Tears and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers incline them to an univerſal Peace, and unite them in a Holy League, and Confederacy againſt the common Enemy of Chriſtendom. But whilſt theſe things were meditating, all the deſign was diverted by the treaſon and conſpiracy of the Family of <hi>Colonna,</hi> which ſucceeded in this manner.</p>
               <p>The Family of <hi>Colonna</hi> which was always favourable to the Imperial intereſt, obſerving the proceedings of the Pope, was deſirous to act ſome thing in prejudice to the Allies, and of advantage to the Emperor: and therefore Cardinal <hi>Pompeo</hi> a near Kinſman of that Family, retiring from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Freſcate,</hi> with pretence of remaining there to watch againſt any attempts, that might be made upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> made great levies of men to be ready at any time to execute his deſigns. The Pope growing jealous hereof, increaſed his own Forces, and commanded the <hi>Colonnians</hi> to depart, and withdraw their Soldiers out of the Dominion of the Church; the which being effected at the inſtance of the Cardinal <hi>De la Valle,</hi> who perſuaded them to quit the Eccleſiaſtical State, which they could not diſturb without great ſcandal; the Pope thereby judged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecure, and truſting to the power, and protection of the League, did againſt the common advice, and perſuaſion of all his Friends, for the cauſe only of ſaving charges, disband his Forces. The <hi>Colonnians</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving now the Pope deprived of all his Guards, and expoſed, as it were naked to their pleaſure, aſſembled their Forces, being about 3000 Foot, and 800 Horſe near <hi>Anagnia,</hi> aſſuming to their ſociety <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar Filettin,</hi> their Confederate, and taking a compaſs to <hi>Rome,</hi> to be the leſs ſuſpected, they ſurpriſed three Gates of the City, making their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by that of S. <hi>John de Lateran</hi>; and having paſſed the Bridg of <hi>Siſtus</hi> with their Battalions orderly drawn up, they entered ſome Forces by the Burg of S. <hi>Spirito.</hi> At this action there were preſent <hi>Don Hugo de
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50681:253"/>
Moncada, Aſcanio Colonna,</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian Colonna,</hi> which laſt had been inſtrumental in ſoliciting the late accord, and given his Faith to the Pope, as well for himſelf, as for the reſidue of his Companions. Likewiſe Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Pompeo</hi> was there, being ſo far tranſported with ambition, that he not only conſpired, and reſolved to put the Pope to death, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Cardinals by force of Arms to elect him to the Papal Chair. The Pope ſurpriſed with the unexpected arrival of theſe Gueſts,<note place="margin">1525.</note> who by break of day on the 20th. of <hi>September</hi> entered <hi>Rome,</hi> reſolved once after the example of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. to ſeat himſelf in his Pontifical Chair, and there receive the utmoſt violence of theſe Traitors; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſuaded from that reſolution by his Friends, he retired to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>S. Angelo,</hi> where he in vain called for the aſſiſtance and ſuccor of his friends. For <hi>Clement,</hi> notwithſtanding the great opinion which at his firſt Inauguration the world conceived of his worth, and merit, was now fallen ſo low in the eſteem of the people by his avarice, and mean practices, that there was not one man, who ſeeing him betrayed, and contrary to Religious Oaths, and the common Faith of mankind falſly treated, conceived any kind remorſe, or compaſſion of his fate. But on the contrary they began to enumerate the many miſcarriages of his Government; That he had laden the Benefices of the Clergy with new and unuſual decimations; That he had taken away the Revenues belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to certain Colleges, made void the Stipends which were given to the Profeſſors, and Readers of Diverſe Sciences: Nor was the Commonalty leſs diſguſted againſt the Pope than others of greater note; for by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Monopolies he had granted upon Corn, to increaſe the benefit and income of his Exchequer, Bread was riſen to that exceſſive price, that it ſeemed as if a Famin had been in the City. He had alſo deſtroyed, and plucked down ſeveral houſes, for making the Streets more large and beautiful, without conſideration given to the Proprietors, tho to the enriching of his own Creatures, whom he had made Superiors over thoſe contrivances. Thus the people being full of hatred, and diſdain againſt the Pope, refuſed in the time of his greateſt exigency to afford him any relief, and defence againſt his enemies; who therefore without oppoſition entered into the new Suburbs, which being ſacked by them, they paſſed no farther for fear of the Cannon from the Caſtle; then they proceeded to the Popes Palace, and the great Church of S. <hi>Peters,</hi> which they plundered, and rifled, laying their Sacrilegious hands on every thing that was rich, or of value: but at length the tumult being appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (for this Riot did not continue above three hours, by reaſon that they did no hurt, or damage to any particular perſon) the Pope, who found himſelf within the Walls of the Caſtle, without any proviſion, or ſuſtenance for himſelf, or his defendants, ſent to <hi>Don Hugo de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cada,</hi> deſiring that he might have a parly, and treaty with him, for the better underſtanding of matters between them. Tho Cardinal <hi>Pompeo</hi> was greatly averſe to all propoſals, or addreſſes for accommodation, yet <hi>Don Hugo</hi> under the Popes Faith, having received the Cardinals <hi>Cibo</hi> and <hi>Rodolfo,</hi> who were of the Popes kindred, as Hoſtages for his ſecurity, went into the Caſtle to treat, and diſcourſe with the Pope; where after many words had paſſed, an agreement was concluded in theſe terms. That a Truce ſhould be made between the Pope and the Confederates on one ſide, and of the Emperor on the other, for the ſpace of four
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50681:254"/>
months: That in the mean time the Pope ſhould withdraw his Army out of the Dukedom of <hi>Milan,</hi> cauſing them immediately to retire on the ſide of the River <hi>Po</hi> towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and call home his Fleet at Sea un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of <hi>Andrew Doria</hi>: That he ſhould pardon the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Pompeo,</hi> with all others of the Family of <hi>Colonna</hi>; and for ſecurity hereof, ſhould deliver <hi>Philip Strozzi,</hi> a wealthy perſon, who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Daughter of <hi>Peter de Medicis,</hi> and one of the Sons of <hi>James Salviati,</hi> for Hoſtages; and to ſend them to <hi>Naples</hi> within the ſpace of two months, on penalty of thirty thouſand Ducats for default thereof. And laſtly, that <hi>Don Hugo</hi> ſhould depart from <hi>Rome</hi> with his whole Army, cauſing every thing to be reſtored, which had ſacrilegiouſly been robbed, and plundered from the holy places. The Truce being thus concluded, much to the diſſatisfaction of Cardinal <hi>Pompeo,</hi> and others of the Family of <hi>Colonna, Don Hugo</hi> chearfully departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuppoſing that he had thereby performed ſufficient ſervice for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and the Pope as readily accepted the Agreement, wanting proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Caſtle, and all other means to make a reſiſtance: But the Pope ſo ſoon as he found himſelf at liberty, and freed of thoſe fears, and dangers which encompaſſed him, having no regard to that Faith, he had given under ſuch compulſive circumſtances, as Impriſonment, and Arms, nor care of the Hoſtages he had delivered, reſolved not longer to maintain the Truce; and thereupon recalled his Forces to <hi>Rome,</hi> being two thouſand <hi>Switzers,</hi> and ſeven Companies of Italian Infantry, under the command of <hi>John de Medicis</hi>; to which adding new Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies as an Auxiliary force, he in the firſt place deprived <hi>Pompeo</hi> of his Cardinals Hat, and publiſhed both him, and all the Family of <hi>Colonna</hi> Excommunicated, and enemies to the Church; and ſo farther proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them by Arms, he demoliſhed and laid waſt <hi>Jubiaco,</hi> which was the Country Houſe, and only place of Pleaſure, in which <hi>Pompeo</hi> delighted, and divertiſed himſelf; and ſent <hi>Vitelli</hi> with his Companies to burn and deſtroy all the Towns, and Countries of the <hi>Colonnians</hi>; as namely, <hi>Marina, Montfortin, Gallicano,</hi> and <hi>Tagarolo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were in action, the Emperor judging it not time to ſit quiet, and ſecure, commanded <hi>Charles de Lonoia</hi> Vice-King of <hi>Naples</hi> to put in a readineſs ſix thouſand <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ordered thirty Sail of ſtout men of War to be ſpeedily equipped, and ſent to the Coaſt of <hi>Italy</hi>; and wrote alſo to his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to perſuade <hi>George Franiſpergio</hi> a Captain of great authority, and renown in <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta,</hi> that he would ſpeedily with three Regiments of <hi>Germans</hi> paſs into <hi>Italy</hi>; whoſe march, aed paſſage over the <hi>Po,</hi> whilſt <hi>John de Medicis</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to hinder, he was unhappily killed by a ſhot from one of the Enemies Sakers, which breaking his thigh a little above his knee, he was carried to <hi>Mantoua,</hi> where he died within a few days after, to the great prejudice of the Enterpriſe, and loſs to the Pope, for being a young man of nine and twenty years of age, whoſe Arms alone the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my feared; whoſe time and years his Experience, and Virtue ſurpaſſed; and being of a moſt excellent temper, neither too forward, and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, nor yet too wary, and diffident, gave evident indications of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming with time one of the moſt eminent Captains in the world.</p>
               <p>In this manner the Truce being abſolutely broken, a moſt cruel War began again in <hi>Italy</hi>; for the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> entering the Eccleſiaſtical
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50681:254"/>
State, had ſome skirmiſhes with the Popes Forces about <hi>Froſolone</hi>; and matters preſſing hard to their diſadvantage, the <hi>French</hi> King was intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make a diverſion by attempting the ſubjection of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> Hereupon it being determined to invade <hi>Naples</hi> both by Sea and Land, Monſieur <hi>De Vaudemont</hi> who by the ancient Right of King <hi>René</hi> laid claim to that Kingdom, was appointed for that enterpriſe, and being arrived with his Fleet, he at the firſt on-ſet took <hi>Salerno</hi>; and thence with great courage, and hopes marching to <hi>Naples</hi> it ſelf, was repulſed by the Forces under the command of <hi>Don Hugo de Moncada.</hi> Howſoever the Pope re-inforcing his Army with new Levies under the command of his Legate <hi>Auguſtin Trivultio,</hi> one greatly affected to the <hi>French</hi> intereſt, the Imperialiſts were worſted, and at length forced to raiſe their Siege from before <hi>Froſolene,</hi> and retire farther within the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of that Kingdom. But this good fortune paſſed no farther.</p>
               <p>For after various ſucceſſes, and many troubles, and deſolations in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Pope wanting mony, grew weary of the War; and being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed by the <hi>French</hi> King, who was great in his promiſes, but little in his performances, having always failed in his times of payment, and neither complied in the ſupplies of men, or mony, he reſolved to cloſe with the propoſitions made him by <hi>Francis de Quignones,</hi> in behalf of the Emperor; in reward of which mediation, he was afterwards promoted to the dignity of Cardinal. In ſhort, the Articles agreed were theſe: That there ſhould be a ceſſation of Arms for eight months, the Pope paying 60000 Ducats to the Imperial Army: That whatſoever had been taken from the Church, the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Family of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna,</hi> ſhould be made good and rendered: That <hi>Pompeo Colonna</hi> ſhould be reſtored to the dignity of Cardinal, and abſolved from all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cenſures; which condition was more grievous to the Pope than all the reſt: That the <hi>French</hi> King and the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould have liberty within a certain time to enter into the League, if they pleaſed: That the Pope ſhould pay forty thouſand Ducats in the ſpace of two and twenty days, and the reſidue in a month after: That the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples</hi> ſhould come to <hi>Rome,</hi> to confirm the Articles; it being judged a good expedient to cauſe the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> to obſerve the accord. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations of Peace being in this manner ſigned, both parties ſpeedily retired their Forces; and the Pope reſolving ſincerely to keep and execute the Articles, was alſo perſuaded, that the other party would do the like; of which being aſſured by the coming of the Vice-Roy to <hi>Rome,</hi> he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly disbanded all his Soldiers, excepting only 200 Horſe, and 2000 Foot, which he ſtill continued in his Pay, being of thoſe valiant Black Bands which had been commanded by <hi>John de Medici.</hi> Matters continued in this poſture for the ſpace of eight days: by which time the news of this accord being made known to the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> and his Army, the Soldiery became enraged, and the Duke raiſed infinite diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties about ſtanding to the Agreement; and eſpecially the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery were ſo violent therein, that a Gentleman ſent by the Vice-Roy to the Duke to perſuade him to accept the Agreement, had been killed by them, had he not conveyed himſelf away from their fury: wherefore the Duke either not being willing, or not able to reſtrain his Soldiery, marched with all ſpeed imaginable to the Walls of <hi>Rome</hi>; to which without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demur, applying his Ladders at the ſide of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> was the firſt,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50681:255"/>
(that he might give courage, and example to his Soldiery) to ſcale the Walls; in which attempt being ſhot by a Cannon-Bullet, he fell dead from the Walls: and leſt his body lying expoſed to the view of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery ſhould give them cauſe of diſcouragement, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> who was near to him covered his Corps with his Cloak: Howſoever the ſtorm ſucceeded more proſperouſly towards the Mount of S. <hi>Spirito,</hi> where they entered on the 14th. of <hi>May,</hi> 1527. with the ſlaughter of ſome few, who had the courage to make any reſiſtance; and paſſing the Bridg of <hi>Siſtus,</hi> the whole Army conſiſting of <hi>Germans, Italians,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to the number of 40000, entered the City, where they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all the ſlaughter, rapin, and violence which enraged and licentious Soldiers were capable to act, without reſpect to things ſacred, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, or to thoſe Cardinals, who had the name, and report of being inclined to the Emperors Faction. <hi>Rome</hi> never ſaw ſo ſad and diſmal a day, no not when they had been ſacked by the <hi>Goths,</hi> and other barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nations; for whomſoever they met, they killed, and cut to pieces, the Streets ran with blood, the Altars were deſpoiled, the Churches and Monaſteries plundered, the Nuns and Women raviſhed, and the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Pope, Cardinals, and Princes rifled and ſacked; ſo that it is impoſſible to expreſs, what Wealth and Riches lay in heaps, and what precious Commodities belonging to Merchants were made the prey of common Soldiers. And what made the ſpoil yet more great, was the number of Priſoners, every one of which was forced to cut his ranſom, and redeem himſelf at a certain price: and to augment the ignominy, as well as the deſolation of this miſerable fortune, the Prelates were taken by the Soldiers, and in all their Pontificalibus and Habits, were ſet upon Aſſes, and Mules, and led through the ſtreets with contempt and deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Pope amidſt theſe diſtractions fled to the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> his uſual Sanctuary, where being ſtreightly Beſieged, with great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of thoſe who retired thither for refuge, he ſoon began to want Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; ſo that Famin conſtrained him to yield himſelf into the hands of his Enemies upon diſcretion, and on conditions of doing whatſoever the Emperor ſhould as a Conqueror impoſe upon him: And in the mean time, until Meſſengers could be ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> and return to <hi>Rome</hi> with the Emperors pleaſure, it was agreed that the Pope ſhould pay to the Army 400000 Ducats, for raiſing of which, all the Veſſels of Gold and Silver belonging to the Churches, which were ſaved from the rapin of the Enemy were to be melted down, and coined; and farther for raiſing mony, divers Cardinals Caps were ſet to ſale, as by publick out-cry to whomſoever would give moſt, who upon payment of the ſums agreed, were to enter into the College and dignity of Cardinals. The perſons who with their mony had purchaſed this quality were <hi>Marino Grimano,</hi> and <hi>Francis Cornaro,</hi> both <hi>Venetians</hi>; likewiſe <hi>Sanſeverino, Carrafa,</hi> and <hi>Parmerio, Neapolitans,</hi> and <hi>Cardona</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi>; and for an Auxiliary help to theſe payments, an impoſt of mony was to be charged upon the whole ſtate of the Church. It was farther agreed that the Pope ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver into the hands of the Emperor, to hold them ſo long as he pleaſed, the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo, Oſtia, Civita Vechia, Caſtellano,</hi> with the Cities of <hi>Parma, Piacenza,</hi> and <hi>Modena:</hi> That the Pope and the thirteen Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals with him ſhould remain Priſoners in the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> until the monies were paid, and afterwards ſhould go to <hi>Naples,</hi> or <hi>Gaietta,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:50681:255"/>
                  <hi>Gaietta,</hi> until the pleaſure and determination of the Emperor was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> being dead, the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> was made Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in his place; to whom whilſt things were acting in this manner, advices came, that Monſieur <hi>De Lautrec,</hi> with a very great Army, by order of <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, to which alſo <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth of <hi>England</hi> had joyned his Forces, was marching towards <hi>Rome,</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to reſcue the Pope from thoſe inſolent hands, under which he was a Priſoner: The news of which cauſed great tumults and mutinies amongſt the Soldiery, who being deſirous to depart quietly with their prey, before they were forced to diſgorge it again, uſed all imaginable inſolences towards the Pope, to compel him to a payment of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears, with the monies promiſed: but he not being maſter of one peny, was conſtrained to deliver into their hands the perſons of ſeveral rich men, which they had named, for ſecurity of the mony promiſed. But the ill fortune of <hi>Clement</hi> ſtopped not here, for ſo ſoon as the news of the Popes impriſonment was heard at <hi>Florence,</hi> the Inhabitants judged it a ſeaſonable opportunity to recover their liberty, and thereupon beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king themſelves to Arms, they forced the Cardinal of <hi>Cortona,</hi> with <hi>Hippolito,</hi> and <hi>Alexander de Medicis</hi> to abandon the City, and ſo reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed unto themſelves the free adminiſtration of a Common-wealth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Authority of a Gonfalonnier, created according to their ancient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> and in the Wars which Pope <hi>Leo</hi> made againſt the <hi>French:</hi> for which reaſons, they perſecuted thoſe Citizens that had been friends to the <hi>Medices</hi>; they reverſed, and defac'd through the City the Arms of that Family; they brake the Images of <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> which were rare pieces of Sculpture, and famous through the world; and in ſhort they omitted nothing which might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Pope with indignity, and diſhonor, and nouriſh diviſion, and diſcord in the City.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> the Army was very diſorderly and tumultuous, governing themſelves, rather than obeying the command of their General the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi>; for they were wholly diſpoſed to prey and violence, to get Ranſoms, and receive the mony promiſed them by the Pope, no care be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had of the intereſt of the Emperor; nor was there any reſolution ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to remove the Army from <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Peſtilence raged, and was entered into the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> to the great hazard of the Pope's life, many being dead thereof who ſerved about his perſon: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, as the Imperial Army yielded little obedience to their Captains, ſo they made no great diſturbances, nor gave fears to their enemies; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> flying from the infection of the Plague lay diſperſed about the Confines of <hi>Rome</hi>; and the Prince of <hi>Aurange</hi> was gone to <hi>Siena</hi> to avoid the Plague, and keep that City in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and Obedience to the Emperor. Wherefore all matters of action at that time were quiet, and in repoſe, until Monſieur <hi>De Lautrec</hi> who was Captain General of the League made between <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> for ſetting the Pope and all <hi>Italy</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:50681:256"/>
at liberty, appeared in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> whoſe ſucceſs was ſo fortunate, that he took <hi>Genoua,</hi> compelled <hi>Alexandria de la Paglia</hi> to ſurrender, and having for four days battered <hi>Pavia,</hi> he forced it to yield at diſcretion, giving it up to the plunder and cruelty of his Soldiery; and laſtly ended that years Champaign with glory, wintering his Army in the City of <hi>Bologna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Imperialiſts being a little mortified, and abaſed with this ſucceſs of <hi>Lautrec,</hi> were deſirous to make the beſt bargain they could with the Pope, before he were forced from them, and agreed upon the payment of 60000 Ducats to the <hi>Germans,</hi> and 30000 to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to pay the reſidue at a certain time, to ſet the Pope and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals at liberty, and afford them ſafe conduct to <hi>Orvieto,</hi> which was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and choſen by the Pope for the place of his ſecurity, and retreat. Upon this accord the Pope being guarded by the Imperialiſts, with leſs caution than before, gave him opportunity in the diſguiſe and habit of a Merchant to make his eſcape; which he rather determined to do, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his freedom in that manner, than to expect the formal conduct of the Imperial Guards, ſuſpecting that <hi>Don Hugo de Moncada</hi> who was Vice Roy of <hi>Naples</hi> in the place of <hi>Lanoia</hi> dead of the Plague, and who had no good will towards him, would play him ſome trick, and baffle with him at the concluſion of all.</p>
               <p>The Pope being now at liberty in <hi>Orvieto,</hi> after ſeven months impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, was inſtantly congratulated by the Duke of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs of <hi>Salutta,</hi> and other Captains of the League, to whom having returned thanks for their kind and obliging Offices, he deſired them to withdraw their Forces out of the Dominions of the Church, aſſuring them that the Imperialiſts had promiſed to depart thence, in caſe the Confederates would ſhew them the firſt example: He wrote alſo Letters to Monſieur <hi>Lautrec,</hi> giving him to underſtand, that he with great ſence acknowledged the influence which his appearance in <hi>Italy</hi> had contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards his liberty, having much facilitated, and eaſed the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on which he was to receive it: and that the reaſon why he did not expect the glorious time, in which he was to have been delivered by his powerful hand, was, becauſe his neceſſities compelled him to procure his liberty with the greateſt ſpeed; for he obſerved, that the conditions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on him, always changed from bad to worſe; that in the mean time the Church was oppreſſed, his Authority contemned, and he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred uncapable of being that happy inſtrument of mediation, which was now required to ſettle peace among Chriſtian Princes. Thus far were excellent words, and ſuch as became a Biſhop under his mortifying cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; but his words, and anſwers in other things, according to his natural temper, were in ſubſtance different at one time, to what they were at an other. For when <hi>Gregory Caſtle,</hi> the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador came to him about the beginning of the year 1528.<note place="margin">1528.</note> deſiring him to continue firm to the Confederates, he would ſome time give him hopes, and then again excuſe himſelf, as being ſo unfortunate, as to have neither Men, Mony, nor Authority remaining to him.</p>
               <p>The Pope having now abandoned <hi>Rome,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Lautrec</hi> upon his march towards <hi>Naples,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> the Imperialiſts on the 17. of <hi>February</hi> left the City in a naked and poor condition, deſpoiled of all its Ornaments, and Riches, and applyed themſelves to Counſels in what manner they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50681:256"/>
might give a ſtop to the proceedings of <hi>Lautrec,</hi> who departed from <hi>Bologna</hi> the 9th. of <hi>January.</hi> No ſooner were the Imperialiſts departed, than the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſins</hi> with their Tenants and Paiſants entered to complete the ſpoil and deſolation of that City, of which not only the Houſes were rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Riches carried away, but all the Statues, Columns, and curious pieces remained a prey to theſe Locuſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lautrec</hi> in his march towards <hi>Naples,</hi> took not the neareſt way, but rather for the more commodious carriage of his Cannon, and for the benefit of Forrage, and other Proviſions, fetched a compaſs by the way of <hi>Puglia</hi>: his Army conſiſted of 400 Lances, 6000 Footmen, old and Veterane Soldiers; beſides the Forces of the Marquiſs of <hi>Salutta,</hi> who marched in the Van, and the Regiments of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the Black Bands of <hi>Florence</hi> which were in much eſteem, and reputation with Monſieur <hi>Lautrec.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, at the firſt appearance of <hi>Lautrec</hi> within this Kingdom, <hi>Capua, Nola, Acerra, Averſa,</hi> and all places yielded to him; but <hi>Naples</hi> endured a long Siege: at which Monſieur <hi>Lautrec</hi> dying of a Fever, and moſt of the Captains and Soldiers dead of the Plague, cauſed by the Contagion of thoſe that were privately ſent out of the City to infect the Camp, the enterpriſe upon that Kingdom had an end.</p>
               <p>In the mean time whilſt theſe things were in action, <hi>Saſſatello</hi> rendred to the Pope the Rock of <hi>Imola,</hi> and <hi>Sigiſmond Malateſta</hi> upon ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions reſigned <hi>Rimini</hi> into his hands; and the Pope having a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to re-inſtate his Friends and Relations, and advance his own Intereſt and Power again in <hi>Florence,</hi> he ſeemed inclining to the party of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, in whoſe power only it was to ſettle the Affairs of his Family in their priſtine ſtate: and therefore perceiving the Affairs of the <hi>French,</hi> and the other Confederates to decline in <hi>Italy,</hi> he forgot all the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done to him by the Emperor, and entered into a perfect friendſhip, and fair correſpondence with him. And farther to advance himſelf in the good opinion of the Emperor, he called for a review of the cauſe of Divorce between <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Catharine</hi> his Queen,<note place="margin">1529.</note> and Aunt to the Emperor; for which having at the time of thoſe great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions he lay under from the Emperor granted a Bull, did now on terms of reconciliation, cauſe the ſame to be revoked. And now the Pope following his reſolution, and cloſely attending a fair concluſion with the Emperor, a Peace was concluded between them at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> much to the advantage of the Pope; proceeding perhaps (as may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved) from a ſenſe the Emperor might have conceived of the unjuſt and hard uſage he had exerciſed towards him: and becauſe the urgency of his Affairs did call him into <hi>Italy,</hi> he might imagin that the countenance, and favor of the Pope might be uſeful: and for theſe reaſons it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, and agreed, That a perpetual Peace, and Confederation be made between the Emperor, and the Pope: That the Pope ſhould grant free paſſage to the Emperors Army through the Eccleſiaſtical State, in caſe it ſhould depart out of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> That the Emperor ſhould re-inſtate the Son of <hi>Laurence de Medicis</hi> in the ſame condition of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and power at <hi>Florence,</hi> as they had been in before their expulſion thence, or their Predeceſſors had enjoyed at any time before: That the Emperor ſhould by ſuch ways and terms as were moſt convenient, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by force of Arms, or otherwiſe, cauſe the poſſeſſion of <hi>Cervia,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50681:257"/>
Modena, Reggio,</hi> and <hi>Rubiera</hi> to be reſtored to the Pope. That theſe particulars being performed, the Pope ſhould in conſideration thereof yield unto the Emperor the whole and abſolute Inveſtitute of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> with the Tribute only of a White Horſe yearly to be given in acknowledgment of Fealty; together with the nomination of four and twenty Cathedral Churches, which had formerly been in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, but now were determined to belong to the Emperor; the Churches only which were not under Patronage to be reſerved to the Pope: That when the Emperor ſhould have paſſed into <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Pope and he ſhould have an interview, and meet at <hi>Bologna,</hi> or ſome other conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent place, to conſult about their Affairs, and matters relating to the Peace and ſettlement of the Church. And that the Emperor, and his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould exerciſe their Temporal Arms againſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and others who had revolted from the Roman Church, and ſecond the Spiritual Weapons of Excommunications, and Eccleſiaſtical cenſures, which were iſſued againſt them: That the Pope ſhould grant Plenary Abſolution to all thoſe, who had lately been injurious to the Apoſtolical Sea, or had by any violent, or hoſtile acts committed outrages againſt it: And laſtly, to confirm, and conſummate all theſe Articles by the more endearing terms of Alliance, the Emperor was to give <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> his natural Daughter in Marriage to <hi>Alexander de Medicis</hi> Son of <hi>Laurence,</hi> late Duke of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> with twenty thouſand Ducats of yearly Revenue; on whom the Pope intended to eſtabliſh the temporal greatneſs of his Family; having not long ſince created <hi>Hippolito</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, who was the Son of <hi>Julian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Peace was ſoon afterwards followed by another between the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and the <hi>French</hi> King,<note place="margin">1529.</note> treated at <hi>Cambray,</hi> of which the Pope was the chief Mediator by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Capua,</hi> who was ſent thither as Legate. The concluſion of this grand Affair did much facilitate the Emperors deſign upon <hi>Florence,</hi> which he committed to the charge, and management of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; who in purſuance of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands having muſtered his Forces about <hi>Aquila,</hi> he was deſired by the Pope to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he might the better conſult, and reſolve with him upon the proviſions, and ways of carrying on the War. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> accordingly coming, was received by the Pope with great reſpect, to whom towards payment of the Army, thirty thouſand Ducats were iſſued out of the Popes Treaſury, and ſoon after forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more; with which, and with three pieces of Cannon taken out of the Caſtle S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> the Prince departing, he encamped before <hi>Peruſa,</hi> which was in the firſt place to be reduced to the obedience of the Church. This place being held by <hi>Malateſta, Baillon</hi> was ſurrendred upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and thence the Prince entering on the Lands, and Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Florentines,</hi> encamped before <hi>Spella,</hi> which was in a ſhort time delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were acting, the Emperor departed from <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi> with a great Fleet, wherein were a thouſand Horſemen, and nine thouſand Foot, with which he arrived at <hi>Genoua,</hi> to the great terror of all <hi>Italy,</hi> and eſpecially of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> who thereupon made choice of four Embaſſadors to congratulate his arrival, and endeavour to make ſome agreement with them for compoſition of their Affairs. When theſe Embaſſadors were admitted to the preſence of the Emperor, and that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50681:257"/>
the Ceremonies of Congratulation were paſt; they declared, That their City was not ambitious, or deſirous of great enlargements, or extents of juriſdictions, but only to conſerve their own with their Rights and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, being willing to be beholding to the power of any mighty Monarch, who would be pleaſed to take them into his protection. That they had aſſociated and entered into Confederacy with <hi>France,</hi> it was no matter of their own choice, but in obedience, and compliance with the Pope, who at that time commanded them; but that now they had thrown off all conſiderations of his Temporal Power, or his Families over them; and that their Commiſſion extending no farther than to a Treaty with the Emperor, they could not give ear to any thing which had reference to the Pope. This anſwer being unpleaſing to the Emperor, the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors were refuſed farther Audience at <hi>Piacenza,</hi> tho they had followed the Court of the Emperor with that expectation from <hi>Genoua</hi> to that place; ſo that their Negotiation was at an end for that time.</p>
               <p>By this time being about the beginning of the year 1530.<note place="margin">1530</note> the Pope arrived firſt at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and the Emperor ſoon after came to him; where he was received by the Pope with great honor, and lodged in the ſame Palace with him; and ſuch ſigns of familiarity and friendſhip paſſed, as if there had never happened any of thoſe diſguſts, and violent actions between them, which we have formerly mentioned, or at leaſt that they had with a real and unfeigned pardon been entirely forgotten. Thus mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appearing fair, and clear between them, the Emperor intended to paſs ſome time in <hi>Italy,</hi> in regard his Affairs in other parts ſeemed not much to require his preſence: for that <hi>Soliman</hi> the Magnificent, who was then Grand Signior, and had beſieged <hi>Vienna,</hi> was forced to raiſe his Camp, and return to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>; and the Peace being newly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with <hi>France,</hi> nothing ſeemed in outward appearance which might give him cauſe of avocation, or diverſion from the Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi> Wherefore it was reſolved that the Emperor ſhould proceed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there be Crowned, taking <hi>Siena</hi> in his way, for better diſpatch, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition in the deſign upon <hi>Florence:</hi> but whilſt theſe things were medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, Letters came from the Electoral College to the Emperor, earneſtly intreating him, that he would be pleaſed ſpeedily to return into <hi>Germany,</hi> to conſider about the matter of Summoning a General Council for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion, and Election of his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to be King of the <hi>Romans</hi>; and alſo to prepare matters for reſiſtance of the <hi>Turk,</hi> who had ſworn to return thither again in a ſhort time. Theſe matters ſeeming of conſiderable importance, were the cauſe that the Emperor changed his reſolution of proceeding to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was Crowned at <hi>Bologna</hi> by the hand of the Pope, at which there was a great confluence of people, tho not that magnificence and pomp as had been uſual at the Inauguration of other Emperors. The day of his Coronation was the Feaſt of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias,</hi> a day thrice auſpicious to him, being the day of his Nativity, the day on which he took the <hi>French</hi> King Priſoner, and the day on which he was inveſted in the Imperial Dignity.</p>
               <p>This Solemnity being paſt, the Emperor prepared for his Journey into <hi>Germany</hi>; howſoever before his departure, the Pope having ſetled his own buſineſs with him touching the ſubjection of <hi>Florence,</hi> other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of difference relating to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to the Inveſtiture of <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> into the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and <hi>Alfonſo d' Eſte,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:50681:258"/>
were referred by compromiſe to the ſentence and determination of the Emperor; the expectation of which judgment gave for ſome time quiet and repoſe to the Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi> After which, the Emperor proceeded to <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Pope returned to <hi>Rome</hi>; where after ſome ſhort time, he received the joyful news of the ſurrender of <hi>Florence</hi>; which having endured a long Siege by the Emperors Army under the command of the Prince of <hi>Aurange,</hi> and after his death of <hi>Don Ferrand de Gonzaga,</hi> yielded it ſelf by common conſent of the people to the government of twelve Citizens, who being of the Faction of the <hi>Medices,</hi> did without attending the Declaration of the Emperor, leave <hi>Florence</hi> entirely to the pleaſure and diſpoſal of the Pope; at whoſe inſtance and perſuaſion the Emperor declared <hi>Alexander de Medicis</hi> Prince, and Duke of <hi>Florence</hi>; and the ſame right of Honor and Dignity to deſcend from him, to his Heirs for ever: the which power and title hath ſince that time continued in that Illuſtrious Family. Whilſt theſe things were acted in <hi>Italy,</hi> a Diet was aſſembled at <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> at which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperors Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was elected King of the <hi>Romans</hi>; where alſo notice being taken of the great increaſe of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrin, which had ſpread it ſelf in all parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and had taken root in the greateſt and moſt Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Families; it was concluded by all ſides, and parties, as well <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as others, that the only means to reform Affairs, and confirm thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins which were ſound and Orthodox, was only in the Power, and Authority of a General Council: for the moderate Party which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Papal Intereſt, conſidering the many abuſes crept into the Church, and the exorbitant power of the Clergy, hoped that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil would reduce matters to more equal terms. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> on the other ſide, having formed a great and numerous Party, did apprehend that many of the dignified Clergy, that were to be Members of that Council, would prove well inclined, and affected to them; where mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being debated with freedom and candor, the nakedneſs of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would be expoſed, and its Corruptions diſcovered. This being the general ſenſe of all <hi>Germany,</hi> which the Emperor was willing to ſatisfie, he ſent to the Pope, urging him to ſummon a Council; to perſuade him whereunto, he deſired him to recal unto his memory, the perſonal Conferences they had entertained at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and the aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he had there given him of faithfulneſs, and adherence to the Church; promiſing him, that neither his Authority nor Dignity ſhould be brought into any danger; for that he would be there preſent in perſon to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe any contrivances which might be deſigned againſt either. Nothing could come more ungrateful than this Propoſition to the Pope and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, who were not willing to expoſe the exceſſive abuſes and exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to the teſt of a Council; where perhaps, the authority of Indulgences, the largeneſs of Diſpenſations, and other Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors being diſcuſſed, would give admiſſion into thoſe ſecrets, which were not to be touched, or opened. The Pope alſo had ſome ſecret reſerves of his own, which he would not have committed to the ſcrutiny of a a Council: he was not willing perhaps to have it debated, that he was born Illigitimate which incapacitates him of being a Cardinal, and conſequently of being Pope. Nor would he have the ſuſpicion of Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, with which he practiſed with Cardinal <hi>Colonna,</hi> called into queſtion; beſides many other particulars, of which he feared to be cenſured by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50681:258"/>
the Council: upon conſideration of all which, after conſultations had with the Cardinals deputed to the diſcuſſion of that matter, many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were given to the Emperor, againſt the preſent Aſſembling of ſuch a Council; but when the time ſhould appear more ſeaſonable, that then the Indictions might be regulated with many proper and cautious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; as that the Council ſhould be celebrated in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that the Pope ſhould be perſonally preſent at it: and that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſhould promiſe to ſubmit the determination and deciſion of their Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies and Opinions, to the judgment and ſentence of a Council, and in the mean time deſiſt from the declaration, or propagation of their Doctrins: the which being a matter difficult, and unpracticable, the propoſition for a Council became ineffectual, and the thoughts thereof laid aſide until the Reign of another Pope.</p>
               <p>Tho the Pope did not think fit to gratifie the deſires of the Emperor, and all <hi>Germany</hi> with a General Council; yet the Emperor not unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Arbitration he had accepted for ſettlement of the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> did about the beginning of the year 1531.<note place="margin">1531.</note> reaſſume the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thoſe matters. In the firſt place therefore he decreed that the City of <hi>Florence</hi> ſhould be governed by the ſame Magiſtrates, and by the ſame model, and form of rule, as it had formerly been in the time of the <hi>Medices</hi>; that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Popes Nephew ſhould be chief in the Government, and ſo ſucceſſively his Heirs for ever: all the ancient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges and Immunities formerly granted by him, or his Predeceſſors were again reſtored and confirmed; with condition notwithſtanding of forfeiture, in caſe the Magiſtrates or People of that City ſhould attempt any thing againſt the authority and greatneſs of the <hi>Medices:</hi> the which Sentence he pronounced with a Deſpotick power, not by virtue of a compromiſe, or reference to him by the parties concerned, but by an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority inherent in the Imperial Dignity. And tho this determination was pleaſing to the Pope, yet by the other relating to the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> he was much offended: for after that Controverſie had been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, heard, and examined by many Doctors and Teſtimonies, and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings produced, the Emperor according to the counſel, and report made him, pronounced, that <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Reggio</hi> appertained of right to the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi>; who paying a hundred thouſand Ducats to the Pope, the Tributes ſhould be reduced to their ancient cuſtom, and he inveſted in the Juriſdiction of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> But the Pope would neither allow that part of the Sentence, nor accept the payment of the mony, wherein the Duke was condemned, refuſing the Tribute which was offered to him according to the uſual cuſtom: ſo that there was neither open War, nor a ſetled Peace between the Pope, and the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi>; for having a regard, and ſome reſpect to the Emperors Award, and Sentence, he feared to aſſail him with open force, contriving in the mean time ſecret plots, and devices wherewith to enſnare him.</p>
               <p>Matters thus continued with ſome tranquillity, until the year 1532.<note place="margin">1532:</note> which was more ſignal for Forein Wars, than for the Commotions of <hi>Italy:</hi> For <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, not forgetting the ſufferings he had ſuſtained by the Emperor, contrived all ways imaginable for his revenge, not being ſcrupulous or aſhamed of ſecret practices and treaties with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi> in deſpight of his Title of <hi>Moſt Chriſtian,</hi> to ſtir him up, and incite him to a War againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50681:259"/>
him to make a ſecond attempt by laying ſiege to <hi>Vienna. Soliman</hi> being full of anger, and diſdain for the late foil he had received before that City, was eaſily perſuaded to try his fortune in another Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the Princes and Free Towns of <hi>Germany</hi> concurring with their Forces, and uniting them to the Imperial Troops, compoſed a moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Army, which being conducted by <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, who was the greateſt Captain of his age, and his name terrible to the <hi>Turks: Soliman</hi> made only ſome incurſions into <hi>Hungary,</hi> and then returned again to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before this news came, and whilſt theſe things were in action, <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. King of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King being both highly diſpleaſed with the Emperor, met together at <hi>Boloign</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where they held ſeveral Conſultations how to improve the preſent ſtate of Affairs to their own advantage. And giving it for granted, that the <hi>Turk</hi> would Winter in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and afford the Emperor ſufficient em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for the year following; they reſolved to make uſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of Affairs to their mutual benefit: in purſuance of which, it was determined between them, that the <hi>French</hi> King was to invade the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Pope was to be induced to aſſiſt in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and to determin the cauſe of Divorce of Queen <hi>Catharine</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of King <hi>Henry,</hi> then depending in the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> with which meſſage and inſtructions the Cardinals of <hi>Ternon,</hi> and <hi>Gramont</hi> were ſent Embaſſadors to the Pope. But King <hi>Henry</hi> having not the patience to attend the reſult, contemned the authority of a Divorce by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Power, contenting and ſatifying his own Conſcience with what had before been diſputed, and determined in the Courts of <hi>England</hi> about that matter: and having underſtood, that the Legate <hi>Campeius</hi> had been ſent into <hi>England</hi> with a Bull of Divorce, which afterwards upon change of the Pope's mind he had burnt, the King was ſo enraged thereat, that he reſolved not to have farther dealings with the Pope;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chron.</note> and thereupon Proclamation was publiſhed, that no perſon of what eſtate or condition ſoever,<note place="margin">c.</note> ſhould purchaſe, or attempt to purchaſe from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> any thing prejudicial to the Juriſdiction, or Prerogative of this Realm, upon pain of Impriſonment, or other puniſhment, according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the King.</p>
               <p>But the retirement of the <hi>Turks</hi> out of <hi>Hungary</hi> put a period to the deſign of Invading the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and to the expectation the King of <hi>England</hi> had of receiving a favourable ſentence at <hi>Rome</hi> in the point of Divorce; for the reſult of the Interview of theſe two Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known at <hi>Rome,</hi> haſtned the Pope to make a League with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, which was concluded at a ſecond meeting at <hi>Bologna,</hi> where the ſame Ceremonies, and terms of amity, and friendſhip paſſed between them, as had been formerly at the firſt. After which the Emperor by the way of <hi>Genoua</hi> paſſed into <hi>Spain</hi>; and the Pope returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied thither by the two Cardinals, <hi>Ternon,</hi> and <hi>Gramont</hi>; the which according to their Commiſſion inſiſted greatly to have the Divorce of Queen <hi>Catharine</hi> confirmed by the Popes Authority; alledging the great damage, and ruine that an obſtinate perſiſtance to the contrary might bring to the Church: but the Cardinals of the Emperors Faction labouring to the contrary, and the Pope underſtanding what <hi>Henry</hi> had already acted in that point in <hi>England,</hi> iſſued an Excommunication
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50681:259"/>
againſt him, and his whole Realm, unleſs before the end of <hi>September</hi> following, he did revoke all the Acts he had made, to the prejudice of the Apoſtolical Sea, and the Papal Authority.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>French</hi> Cardinals finding their Negotiations in reference to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to be unſucceſsful, and deſperate; treated notwithſtanding an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view between the Pope and the <hi>French</hi> King, to be held at <hi>Marſeille</hi>; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring their deſign with the ſpecious pretence of finding ſome expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to accommodate matters between King <hi>Henry</hi> and the Pope; a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſo great, and Chriſtian, and of that high importance, as might chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the labors and endeavours of the moſt Chriſtian King: and farther it was pretended that a League and Union between the Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was there to be negotiated againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi> But the deſire of the Pope being in reallity to marry his Niece <hi>Catharine de Medicis</hi> to the ſecond Son of the King of <hi>France,</hi> was eaſily perſuaded to condeſcend to a propoſition ſo agreeable to his own inclinations: in purſuance whereof the Pope with a great retinue of Cardinals Embarked at <hi>Piſa</hi> on his own Gallies, and in a few days of proſperous Navigation, he landed at <hi>Marſeille,</hi> where being ſaluted with three hundred pieces of Cannon at his arrival, he was lodged for the firſt night in the Palace of the Duke of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> Grand Maſter, and Mareſchal of <hi>France.</hi> The next day he made his entry through the City, habited in his Pontifical Veſtments, and carried in his Chair upon mens ſhoulders; before him a White Horſe was led by two men, with ſilken Reins, carrying the Sacrament of the Altar; then followed the Cardinals in their Habits, mounted upon their Mules; after which came <hi>Catharine de Medicis,</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> attended with a great number of Ladies and Gentlemen, both of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Nation; in which equipage the Pope paſſed the Streets to the Lodgings which were provided for him. The day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the <hi>French</hi> King came, and with great ſolemnity went to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Offices of Duty, and Obedience to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Theſe Solemnities and Ceremonies being paſt, matters of publick concernment were in the firſt place taken into conſideration by thoſe who were by the King and the Pope delegated to conſult thereof: and tho the Marriage was the main point, which moved the Pope to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take this Journey, yet it was in the laſt place, and as it were accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by the by treated of: The firſt thing aſſumed, was the propoſal about a General Council, but that was ſoon rejected, and executed with the ſame reaſons, and replies as were given to the Emperor. In the next place the King of <hi>Englands</hi> caſe was warmly inſiſted upon by the Commiſſioners of the <hi>French</hi> King as it had been formerly agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Kings at <hi>Bulloin</hi>; but thoſe inſtances produced little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for the Miniſters of the King of <hi>England</hi> being in a huff, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to the diminution of the Popes Authority appealing to a Council; with which the Pope referred their Cauſe to be farther debated at his return to <hi>Rome</hi>: and the <hi>French</hi> King being deſirous in all things to ſatisfie, and comply with the Pope, he told him, that it would not be diſpleaſing to him, in caſe he proceeded againſt that King according to the Rule of Juſtice, and the ancient Canons of Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure; by which fair and friendly compliance, the Pope would not refuſe at the inſtance of the <hi>French</hi> King to create four Cardinals, tho much againſt his own inclinations, fearing thereby to have rendered the <hi>French</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:50681:260"/>
Faction too ſtrong, which already was more prevalent in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> than the Pope deſired. In the laſt place, tho the firſt in deſign, the Marriage between the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Pope's Niece was treated and concluded; and the parties married by the Pope himſelf: by which a ſtrict and firm Alliance, and friendſhip being created between the <hi>French</hi> King and the Pope, it ſeemed as if all thoſe profeſſions of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and good will, which had lately interceded at <hi>Bologna</hi> between the Emperor and the Pope had vaniſhed, or ſignified little; and now amongſt other Articles, it being capitulated, that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> ſhould be inveſted in the Dukedom of <hi>Milan</hi>; it was with no leſs wonder conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the intereſt of <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> the true and right Heir to that Dutchy, and for which both this, and other Popes had ſo earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, could ſo eaſily be made void, and transferred over to a Forein Prince, who could pretend no other right thereunto, than the might, and power of his own Arms.</p>
               <p>With entertainment of theſe Affairs, a months time being ſpent at <hi>Marſeille,</hi> the Pope returned to <hi>Rome</hi>; where, ſo ſoon as he arrived, he foretold his own death, acquainting his Friends, and Domeſticks about his perſon; that he had not long to live; and therefore in order to his Burial, he commanded the Ring to be provided, and the Veſtments in which Popes were uſually interred: howſoever before his death, he thundered out his Bulls of Excommunication againſt <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. King of <hi>England,</hi> and all the people of his Realm; with which the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly incenſed, immediately withdrew his Obedience from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Sea, and declared himſelf Head under Jeſus Chriſt of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; forbidding mony to be tranſported out of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and commanded the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to renounce his Title of Legate from the Pope: the which was the beginning of that bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,<note place="margin">1534.</note> which hath purged the Church of <hi>England</hi> from Errors, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it pure in its Doctrin, introduced the true, and glorious light of the Goſpel, which will with Gods aſſiſtance for ever remain ſure, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable in deſpight of all the contrivances either of the Fanatical irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious malice, or the power, or policies of the Roman Church: And moreover it was the beginning of that liberty which we now enjoy, and the enrichment of this flouriſhing Nation, which now keeps its Treaſures and Acquiſitions to its ſelf, which in former days were emptied into the Coffers of the Pope to make Foreiners opulent, and its people poor.</p>
               <p>But to return to Pope <hi>Clement</hi>; being taken with a pain in his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, a Fever enſued upon it; of which according to his own predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he departed this life the 25th. day of <hi>September,</hi> 1534. leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him in the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> many Jewels, in the Pontifical Chamber infinite Offices, but a very ſmall ſum of mony: he had at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ordinations created three and thirty Cardinals; all which (except Cardinal <hi>De Medicis</hi>) were made to pleaſe others, rather than himſelf. He had been exalted to the Popedom with wonderful felicity, and with the general applauſes, and grand expectations of the world; but in a ſhort time he fell ſtrangely in their opinion; for being of a temper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally irreſolute, and diffident, ſuffered himſelf to be divided by his two familiar friends, men differing in their humors, affections, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; which laid him low in the eſteem of mankind, and hated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by the <hi>Romans</hi>; and yet he was ſober, abſtemious, and a greater
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50681:260"/>
conqueror of himſelf; but accounted covetous, of no fidelity, or faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to his word, nor readily inclined to do any man a good office, unleſs forced thereunto by ſome conſtraining neceſſity; and yet he was grave, and well adviſed in his actions, if timorouſneſs had not oftentimes corrupted his judgment. He proved ſuch diverſity of fortunes, that it is hard to determin, whether his bad, or his good fortune was greateſt: for what evil can be compared to the ſacking of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he beheld with his own eyes; his own, and the long impriſonment of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; the deſolation of his own Country, of which he was an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the promotion only of the Family of the <hi>Medices.</hi> He died in the 67th. year of his age, having held the Papal Chair ten years, ten months, and ſeven days: His Corps were firſt interred in the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but afterwards tranſported to the <hi>Minerva,</hi> by his own Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and laid by the Body of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, over which they ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a ſtately Monument of Marble.</p>

The motives which the Cardinals might have to haſten with ſuch facility, and unanimous aſſent this election might be various; for his family was great, and ancient; He had been forty years a Cardinal, and thereby acquired a competent knowledg of the Affairs of the world, and of the practices of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; and being 68 years of age, and of a weak and tender conſtitution of body, the more robuſt, and ambitious Cardinals expected, that his Reign could not be long before he made way for one of them.

               <p>And as this Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Third was very bountiful in theſe promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo he was no leſs magnificent, and ſtately in his Structures; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the firſt year laid the Foundations of that ſumptuous Building at <hi>Rome,</hi> called by the name of <hi>The Palace of the Farneſi,</hi> which is one of the moſt noble and magnificent Edifices not only in <hi>Rome,</hi> but in all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope: the which I the more willingly mention, becauſe that being my ſelf at <hi>Rome,</hi> I obſerved it to be moſt agreeable to the antique Buildings of old <hi>Rome:</hi> and that beſides the outward Magnificence, it was rarely furniſhed within ſide, with many excellent Statues, as that of <hi>Hercules,</hi> of <hi>Flora,</hi> and a Gladiator, eſteemed the beſt pieces in the world, which are in the Court, or Area below: Then above ſtairs you have the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus, Homer, Herodotus, Pindarus, Cicero, Seneca,</hi> and others; but that of <hi>Caracalla</hi> is beyond them all: he looks fierce, and wants nothing but motion to make you believe it is alive: there are alſo ſome Idol gods, and a Statue of <hi>Socrates</hi> on a Pedeſtal of the ſame Marble: but the moſt famed piece of Art, is the <hi>Toro Farneſe,</hi> which is a furious Bull held by the Sons of <hi>Dirce,</hi> who are tying their Mothers Hairs to the Horns of the Bull; it was brought from <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and eſteemed at a very high value.

Thus much had the pacifick, and quiet ſpirit of <hi>Paul</hi> the Third effected; that amidſt the troubles, and inquietudes of Government he was able to attend to ſuch an expenſive piece of Structure; the which ſhews his averſion to War: for ſtately Buildings, and ornaments of Cities are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the happy effects of Peace: and indeed the Maxim which this Pope obſerved of keeping himſelf in a diſcreet neutrality between the Emperor and the <hi>French</hi> King, did marvellouſly contribute to his eaſe, and proſperity; for by that means, he was courted by them both, and lived without the troubles and expence of War, until he was neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereunto by other emergencies. Moreover, the firſt year of this Popes Government was ſo very happy in the ſeaſonableneſs of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fruitfulneſs of the time, accompanied with ſo many other auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious circumſtances, as made thoſe, who had ſuffered in the late cloudy, and tempeſtuous times of <hi>Adrian,</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> bleſs the returns of <hi>Romes</hi> glory, and proſperity, as if the Golden Age had again entered, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting all to the conduct, and wiſdom of <hi>Paul</hi> the Third; of whoſe great Parts and Abilities they had received apparent inſtances in the Reign of <hi>Clement</hi> VII. who ſo kindly accepted the ſolicitations and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors which this <hi>Alexander</hi> when he was Cardinal had performed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him when he was beſieged in the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> by bringing <hi>Lautrec</hi> to his aſſiſtance, that he gained the primary ſtation of authority and eſteem with him; ſo that being ſick, and oppreſſed with a pain in his ſtomach, he would often ſay, that if the ſucceſſion to the Popedom were hereditary, or could be diſpoſed of by Will and Teſtament, he ſhould judg no other ſo worthy to be his Heir, as this <hi>Alexander</hi>; who now, as we have ſaid, being elected Pope on the 12th. of <hi>October,</hi> was Crowned on the ſecond of <hi>November</hi> following, with all the Ceremonies uſual at that Solemnity.</p>
               <p>Being thus ſettled in his Pontificate, he reſolved to adhere to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Principle, and Maxim of Neutrality; and therefore could never be perſuaded to revoke, or annul the League which was made between <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh his Predeceſſor, and <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor at <hi>Bologna:</hi> for tho that League was principally calculated, and deſigned to drive the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> to which, tho perhaps the dominion of the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts might be equally grievous, and oppreſſive; yet conſidering, that ſuch a breach of Articles, in favour of the <hi>French,</hi> could not be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out innovations, which muſt neceſſarily produce Wars, and diſturbances in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor effected without impeachment of that Neutrality, which he had often avowed to be indiſpenſably belonging to the Office of Popes, who were the common Parents of all Chriſtian Kings; and therefore he would never give ear to thoſe ſuggeſtions which the <hi>French</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and Faction would frequently inculcate in favour to that King. And whereas the former Pope was always averſe to the inſtances which the Emperor, and <hi>French</hi> King and other Princes made to him for a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council to be held for reforming abuſes crept into the Church, and ſuppreſſing the Opinions of <hi>Luther,</hi> which they called heretical, and which began to dilate, and ſpread themſelves in all parts of Chriſtendom: Now this <hi>Paul</hi> the Third was of ſuch a different ſenſe herein to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, that he freely declared for a Council, ſhewing himſelf willing to meet the deſires of the Princes, and promiſed in a ſhort ſpace to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the time, and place, where ſuch a Council ſhould be held, and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated.

And farther to confirm and improve this good correſpondence with the Chriſtian Courts, he diſpeeded his Emiſſaries, and Legates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all parts, whoſe care it was as well to advance the private intereſts of his Family, as the common benefit of the Church; and particularly to ſolicit, and promote ſuch a good correſpondence, and peace between the Emperor, and the King of <hi>France,</hi> that uniting their Forces for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſafety of Chriſtendom, might joyntly make War upon the <hi>Turk,</hi> and other enemies to the Chriſtian Faith: but herein his deſires found little ſucceſs, for the <hi>French</hi> being beaten out of <hi>Italy,</hi> could not ſupport the proſperity of the Emperor, againſt whom breathing nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, could never be induced to unite their Arms in a common Cauſe; or joyn in a deſign then preparing by the Emperor againſt the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis,</hi> which one <hi>Barbaroſſo</hi> had uſurped: who having by the help of Soldiers, and a ſtrong Fleet furniſhed and equipped at the expence of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi> droven <hi>Mulcaſſes</hi> King of <hi>Tunis</hi> out of his own Country, did with the pyracies he committed, very much infeſt the Coaſts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi>; and being arrived to a conſiderable power, threatned to invade the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> This growing greatneſs of <hi>Barbaroſſo,</hi> and the daily Pyracies he committed were ſufficient provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth to wage War againſt him; and being a Tyrant, and an Infidel, the Pope alſo became concerned in this Holy Cauſe to concur with the Emperor, for whoſe aſſiſtance, he furniſhed out nine Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which were fitted at <hi>Genoua,</hi> beſides three others which were the uſual Guard of the Coaſt; over this Fleet <hi>Virginio Orſinio,</hi> a perſon of great quality was conſtituted Admiral, to whom was joyned <hi>Paulo Giuſtiniano</hi> a Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> and one of great experience in Sea Affairs. The preparations of the Emperor alſo were very great, his Fleet was commanded by Prince <hi>Doria,</hi> who was made Commander in Chief at Sea, to whom the Pope made a preſent of a ſhort Sword, or Poniard with a Hilt ſet with Jewels, and the Scabbard rarely Engraved, and conſecrated with the uſual Ceremonies; likewiſe a Cap of Velvet Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Pearls, which were the accuſtomary Donatives which Popes made to Generals that were employed in a Holy War againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.

               <p>Whilſt the Emperor was in his paſſage between <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices were brought him of the deceaſe of <hi>Francis Sforza,</hi> who was the laſt Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> by whoſe death that Dutchy devolved to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, being afterwards governed by <hi>Antonio de Levae,</hi> in form of a Province: howſoever the Title thereunto was not ſo clear on the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſide, but that the King of <hi>France</hi> laid his claim unto it, not only by right of inheritance, as deſcended from his Great-Grand-Mother <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina,</hi> but by virtue alſo of a conceſſion granted by publick Act from <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor to King <hi>Lewis</hi> XII. of <hi>France,</hi> on a valuable conſideration of mony paid for it, after <hi>Lodowick Sforza</hi> had been taken, and droven from thence. But this pretence ſeemed of little moment to the Emperor, who judging this Dukedom of great importance to his State, came from <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> with intent to perſuade the Pope to joyn with him in a League againſt the <hi>French,</hi> that ſo <hi>Italy</hi> might be more in repoſe, and quiet by expulſion of the <hi>French,</hi> who were always eſteemed great diſturbers of the peace of it. On the 5th. of <hi>April</hi> 1536.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1536.</note> the Emperor came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where being received by the Cardinals, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and all the Orders of the Clergy, with the Citizens, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> where the Pope attended him on the ſteps of the Porch: and the uſual Ceremonies being paſſed, he was lodged in that apartment of the <hi>Vatican</hi> Palace, which was built by <hi>Innocent</hi> VIII. During the reſidence which the Emperor made at <hi>Rome,</hi> he entertained frequent Conferences with the Pope concerning a League to be entered into, between them and the other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> for expelling the <hi>French</hi> out of that Country; who having been always known under the character and notion of the diſturbers of their peace, they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer hope, or expect quietneſs, whilſt that reſtleſs people had any hold, or poſſeſſion in their Quarters. And farther, the Emperor in a publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Pope and all the Cardinals, and Forein Miniſters did moſt ſeverely inveigh againſt <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, as the moſt ungratetul, and faithleſs of all the Princes of the Univerſe: but being ſharply an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and replied upon by Monſieur <hi>Bellay</hi> the Embaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> the Emperor became more moderate in his terms, and diſcourſes on that ſubject; during which time there was a moſt profound ſilence amongſt all the Cardinals in that Auguſt Aſſembly. But then as to the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of a League between the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes for expulſion of the <hi>French,</hi> the Pope did with ſingular reſpect to the Emperor, approve, and praiſe the pious affection he had for the care, and repoſe of <hi>Italy</hi>; but yet as to himſelf he could not recede from his Principle, and reſolution of Neutrality, which he had grounded on the foundation of his Paſtoral Office, and Charge, which enjoyned him to ſeek, and endeavour to the utmoſt of his power an Union, and Peace between Chriſtian Princes;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50681:263"/>
and therefore he heartily urged him to a Peace with the King of <hi>France,</hi> offering himſelf to become the Mediator and Umpire in the accord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: But ſo far was the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> tranſported with anger, and diſdain againſt <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, that he treated him with all the terms of obloquy, that his rage could ſuggeſt; concluding, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could determin, or put a period to the differences between them, but only the death of one of them two; and therefore did publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and challenge <hi>Francis</hi> to a ſingle Combat: but the Pope being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to mitigate this heat with fair words, and gentle perſuaſions, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him, deſired him not to give way to his paſſion; and when the Embaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> would have anſwered ſomething farther in favour of their King, he required them to be ſilent, reſolving not to give ear to any of their Expoſtulations. Hence a cruel War aroſe between the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and <hi>France</hi>; for the Emperor having remained 14 days at <hi>Rome,</hi> departed thence with deſign to Invade <hi>France</hi>; and ſo paſſing through <hi>Toſcany,</hi> and the Juriſdiction of <hi>Genoua,</hi> at the perſuaſion of <hi>Antonio de Leva,</hi> he entered <hi>Provence,</hi> where for want of all Proviſions, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Diſtempers and Sickneſſes which at that time reigned in that Country, his Forces were reduced to great difficulties; which was the reaſon that this War did not continue a year, before a Truce was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of ten months between them: the opportunity of which quiet inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val the Pope improving for making a firm, and conſtant Peace, laboured to appeaſe the incenſed Spirits of thoſe two Princes by an interview at <hi>Nice,</hi> which he propoſed as a place for their Meeting, and where he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf offered to be perſonally preſent: for tho being 73 years old, his age might excuſe him from the fatigue of ſuch a Journey; yet for the ſake of the peace of Chriſtendom, and the piety of this work, he offered himſelf to be Arbitrator of their Controverſies: the which being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto by the two Princes, about the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> 1538. the Emperor, and the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Pope alſo perſonally appeared at the place appointed, where the Pope taking the Propoſitions, and the Demands on both ſides into conſideration, he found ſo many difficult and knotty points to be determined, that deſpairing of any concluſion in manner of a Peace, he propoſed a Truce for ten years between them; during which time, all acts of Hoſtility were to ceaſe, and free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and intercourſe of Trade to be admitted between their Subjects: the which being accepted by both parties, the Emperor, and King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their Dominions, and the Pope to <hi>Rome</hi>; where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the common joy, and acclamations of all the City.</p>
               <p>But to return from theſe ſecular Diſturbances, and Treaties, to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more nearly relating to Religion, and the Church.

                  <q>That ſince the time that this Pope entered into the Papal Dignity, he never had more paſſionately deſired any thing, than to purge the Church of Chriſt, (the care of which was committed to his charge) of all Errors and Schiſms, and to reſtore it to the ancient Diſcipline and ſeverity of the Primitive times; to effect which,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Trent.</note> he judged no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient ſo agreeable, and proper, as a General Council, the which he had often ſignified both to the Emperor, and other Kings; in hopes that after all Errors were corrected, and exploded, and abuſes in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners reformed; that ſuch a Sacred Convention would procure, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a right underſtanding between all Chriſtian Princes, that laying aſide all Quarrels and Animoſities amongſt themſelves, they would unite together in a War againſt Infidels, for recovery of the Countries they had uſurped, and reſcue of our Chriſtian Brethren who ſuffer under their ſervitude, and ſlavery. To which end, by virtue of that abſolute Power committed to him by God, and by and with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of his Brothers the Cardinals, he did Indict, and publiſh a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council to be held at <hi>Mantoua,</hi> at, or upon the 27th. of <hi>May,</hi> of the year following: Commanding and requiring all Biſhops, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of what degree or place ſoever, to be aſſiſtant, and preſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as they were obliged by Oath, and by Holy Canons, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees inſtituted on ſuch occaſions. Deſiring and intreating the Emperor, and all Chriſtian Princes, for the love of Jeſus Chriſt, to be preſent and aſſiſtant there in perſon, if it were poſſible, and conſiſtent with their Affairs; and if not, then to depute their Embaſſadors, and Miniſters with plenary Power, and Authority; as they had already promiſed both to <hi>Clement</hi> and himſelf, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope alſo publiſhed an other Bull at the ſame time, to purge, (as he called it) the City of <hi>Rome</hi> from Vices, and corruption of manners; that ſo, as his intentions were to reform all that was amiſs in the Chriſtian world, (of which in ſpiritual matters he was the Head, and Chief) ſo it was moſt pious to begin at home; that the ſtreams from the original Source might deſcend more pure, and limpid into other parts.</p>
               <p>But the firſt Bull indicting a Council at <hi>Mantoua,</hi> had not been long publiſhed, before the Duke of that place, conſidering, that for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereof, it would be neceſſary to maintain a ſtronger Garriſon, than uſual; the extraordinary charge, and expence of which he demanded of the Pope; with many other hard conditions derogatory to the Papal Power, and ſuch as did infringe that liberty which was always accorded to places, where General Councils had been celebrated: it was therefore thought fit to aſſign an other place; the which being not as yet agreed, the time of Aſſembling was deferred from <hi>May,</hi> until the firſt of <hi>November</hi> following.</p>
               <p>The month of <hi>November</hi> approaching near, the Pope publiſhed an other Bull, appointing the Council to be held at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> a City under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> upon the firſt of <hi>May</hi> next, in the year 1538. deputing for his Legates the Cardinals <hi>Campeggio, Simonetta,</hi> and <hi>Jeronimo Alexandro,</hi> alledging for cauſe of ſuch prolongation the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Winter, which would be very incommodious to thoſe, who were to travel thither from remote parts.

Until this time the Popes, that is, <hi>Clement</hi> VII. and this preſent <hi>Paul</hi> the third had ſubtilly diſſembled matters between them and <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> intending if neceſſity had required to have confirmed his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce from Queen <hi>Catharine</hi>; to which end Cardinal <hi>Campeggio</hi> was ſent into <hi>England,</hi> and joyned in Commiſſion with the Cardinal of <hi>York,</hi> with Authority to give Sentence in favour of the King; and that the matter might receive a ſpeedy diſpatch, and not be ſpun out by length of time, required in the ſolemnity of Judgment, and paſſing Sentence; a Brief was ready framed, and drawn up, and the Bull, or Seal thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to affixed, whereby the Marriage with Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> was made null, and void, in the moſt ample manner, and with Terms and Clauſes ſo full, as nothing could be more expreſſive, nor more large than that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, with inſtructions notwithſtanding not to preſent or publiſh the ſame, unleſs they received aſſurances, that <hi>Henry</hi> would continue firm and conſtant in his Obedience to the Authority of the Church; and in this manner things ſtood, and thus far had proceeded in the year 1528. <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh being then Pope; and ſo remained in ſuſpenſe until the time of this preſent <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, when <hi>Henry</hi> bidding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to the Papal Authority, proceeded to actions never to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with that Church; whereupon the Pope iſſued out his Bull, dated the 30th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1535. whereby he cited King <hi>Henry</hi> to appear per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally before him, and the College of Cardinals at <hi>Rome,</hi> to give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to all thoſe Cruelties, Sacrileges, Adulteries, and other Crimes whereof he ſtood accuſed: and in caſe of refuſal, he pronounced him, and all his Subjects to remain under cenſure of Excommunication; decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him actually deprived of his Crown, and Kingdom; his Subjects abſolved from all Obedience; all actions of Religion interdicted and forbidden to be performed, or celebrated in his Dominions: command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Eccleſiaſtical perſons to depart from his Kingdoms, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to riſe up in Rebellion againſt him. But all this lightning and thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Excommunication did little terrifie the reſolved mind of King <hi>Henry,</hi> but rather incenſed him to proceed in that courſe, which ſince that time, hath laid the happy beginning of that bleſſed Reformation, under which by Gods mercy we enjoy the true, and glorious light of the Goſpel.</p>

any ſuch Convocation aſſembled by the Popes Authority, as being in it ſelf of none effect; excepting alſo againſt the place, as unſecure, and the Country as infeſted with continual Wars. But whereas he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of a General Council, as being the only means whereby to reform the diſſolute matters of the Clergy, and ſuppreſs the exorbitant Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and Uſurpations of the Clergy: he ſhould willingly give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereunto, provided that ſuch Convocation were aſſembled by the Authority of the Chriſtian Kings and Princes, who had the ſole power and diſpoſal of ſuch matters; for as to the Pope, he eſteemed him only as a Biſhop in his own Dioceſs, with no farther extent of Juriſdiction, than that which reacheth thereunto; the which alſo was moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at this time, when the abuſes of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> were the chief matters to be reformed, and to be preſented to the cogniſance and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſuch a Council. Beſides this great defection of <hi>England</hi> from the Papal Obedience, which gave a fatal blow to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Doctrin of <hi>Luther</hi> daily grew, and dilated it ſelf in all parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> with much diſturbance; for allaying of which, and eſtabliſhment of the truth of the Goſpel there was no other remedy men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and cried up by all parties, but a General Council; but this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of ſo many ſcruples, diſputes, and nicities, as to the time and place, that nothing could as yet be reſolved. In the mean time the <hi>Turks</hi> taking advantage upon the diſcord amongſt Chriſtians, entered <hi>Dalmatia</hi> with Fire and Sword, and took the ſtrong Town of <hi>Cliſſa,</hi> which the pope had fortified with all ſorts of Proviſions, and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which misfortune the Pope greatly reſenting, ordered ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions to be made in <hi>Rome,</hi> at which he was preſent in perſon, and walked on foot; and ſent his Legates to moſt Chriſtian Princes, exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to lay aſide the Quarrels, and Wars amongſt themſelves, and unite together againſt the Common Enemy: in order whereunto a League was made between the Pope, the Emperor, and the <hi>Venetians</hi>; the conditions whereof were, that the Emperor ſhould ſet 82 Gallies to Sea, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> the like number, and the Pope 38; with which force of 200 Sail, they agreed to inveſt the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions in ſome parts of <hi>Greece. Andrea D'Oria</hi> was conſtituted Admiral of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Fleet, <hi>Vicenzo Capello</hi> of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Marco Grimano</hi> Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> of the Popes; and in caſe any deſcent were made, or Forces landed, then <hi>Fernando Gonzaga,</hi> Vice-King of <hi>Sicily</hi> was to be <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> or Commander in Chief: but the ſucceſs did not anſwer ſo great preparations, which proved rather diſhonorable, than advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: for this formidable Fleet being at Sea, near the Promontory of <hi>Antium,</hi> had ſight of the Fleet of <hi>Barbaroſſo</hi>; and might with much eaſe have charged and vanquiſhed them; but <hi>Andrea D'Oria</hi> the Emperors Admiral refuſed to engage; ſo that leaving the Enemy, they all divided themſelves into three Squadrons under their reſpective Commanders, ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away in manner of a flight, to the great ignominy, and ſhame of the Chriſtian Arms; which inglorious action did greatly diſpleaſe the Pope, and more eſpecially the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who inſtead of ſome great benefit which they expected in return for all their expence, and hazard, loſt <hi>Caſtlenuovo,</hi> which was ſoon afterwards taken by the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Howſoever this publick Diſgrace was in ſome manner repaired by the favour, and good will of the Emperor towards the Pope, whh beſtowed

               <p>It happened about this time, that <hi>Francis Naria da Meltro,</hi> Duke of <hi>Camerin,</hi> died, the Pope immediately reſolved to make ſeizure of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merino,</hi> pretending that that place was devolved to the Church, ever ſince the death of <hi>John Maria Varano,</hi> whom <hi>Leo</hi> X. had made Duke of that place; for that he leaving no Heirs Male, <hi>Feltro</hi> had by Uſurpation taken poſſeſſion of that place, in right only of <hi>Julia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>John Maria Varano,</hi> whom his Son <hi>Guido <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldo</hi> had taken to Wife, and held the ſame in deſpight of <hi>Clement</hi> the late Pope. And now whereas the preſent Duke was a youth of tender age, and no experience, the Pope made uſe of this opportunity to lay his claim, (which he had concealed during the life of the old Duke) and to make it good raiſed an Army, and marched againſt <hi>Camerino,</hi> with which this young Duke being terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſurrendred the place without other difficulty to the Pope, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſatisfied all pretenders to any Arrears by disburſement of great ſums of mony, he inveſted his Nephew <hi>Ottavio Farneſe</hi> in the place, creating him Duke of <hi>Camerino,</hi> chief Prefect of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Cenſuary of the Church.</p>
               <p>By this and other expences the Chamber was greatly exhauſted of its Treaſure; to recruit which the Pope laid new Gabels and Impoſitions on all Commodities in his Dominions, and eſpecially upon Salt; the which ſo diſcontented the People of <hi>Perugia,</hi> that from a mutiny they took Arms, and appeared in open Rebellion; but being ſoon que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Things being thus reduced, and ſettled in the Temporal State, he converted his thoughts to the quiet and ſecurity of the Church; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that diſturbances in the world proceeded commonly from want of good Inſtruction, and corruption of manners, he commanded the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to their reſpective Dioceſſes, enjoyning them to reſide there, and teach their Flocks with good Lectures, by their own exemplary lives.</p>
               <p>In the year 1540.<note place="margin">1540.</note> he augmented and enlarged the Immunities, and Privileges of the Chamber, and the Authority of the Referendaries: He gave liberty to Clergy men to diſpoſe of their Eſtates by Teſtament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave, or interruption of the Apoſtolical Chamber: He gave liberty alſo to Jews which were converted to Chriſtianity to diſpoſe of their Eſtates according to their own will and pleaſure, and reformed many abuſes in the adminiſtration of Civil, and Criminal Cauſes; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of this year conſtituted Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> his Nephew Legate at <hi>Avignon</hi> in the place of the Cardinal <hi>D'Auch</hi> deceaſed.</p>
               <p>The Pope (as we have declared before) ſhewing himſelf unreſolved in the matter of a Council, being very wavering as to the time, and place, tho he ſeemed always ready to agree thereunto; and from the firſt time, that he was created Pope, evidenced an earneſt deſire above all things to

comply with the Chriſtian Princes in that particular; at length the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> finding their Country toſſed, and embroiled with various diſputes of Religion, reſolved to call a Diet at <hi>Regenſburg,</hi> ſuppoſing that a National Aſſembly might ſettle, and determin Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies in want, and for defect of a General Council; and in purſuance thereof a Diet was opened at <hi>Regenſburg</hi> about the beginning of <hi>March,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſt. <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </note> 1541.</p>
               <p>At this Diet the Emperor himſelf was preſent with great hopes,<note place="margin">1541.</note> that all Controverſies about Religion would be here determined, and <hi>Germany</hi> united in the ſame opinion. Hereunto the Pope ſent Cardinal <hi>Gaſpar Contarini</hi> to be his Legat; a perſon of excellent prudence, and learning, accompanied with ſeveral others well inſtructed in the Intereſt of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and with publick Notaries skilful in drawing up Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Acts, and Forms of Law, to whom above all things it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in charge, not to receive any Papers, or Memorials which might tend to the leaſt abatement, or diminution of the Papal Authority; but in ſuch caſe to break up abruptly, referring thoſe matters to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a General Council. In ſhort, after long Conferences, and Debates, the Diet broke up on the 28th. of <hi>July,</hi> the Emperor referring all that had been done, or tranſacted there to a General Council, or to a National Synod of <hi>Germany,</hi> or to a Diet of the Empire; promiſing to go himſelf into <hi>Italy,</hi> to treat with the Pope on that matter, and in caſe the Pope ſhould appear refractory thereunto, that then notwithſtanding he would within the ſpace of eighteen months, by virtue of his own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority iſſue forth his Writs for calling a Diet of the Empire, for ſetling the Affairs of Religion, and prevail with the Pope to ſend his Legat to it: And in the mean time he commanded the Proteſtants not to receive any other new Doctrins, than ſuch as had already been debated; and enjoyned the Biſhops to reform the abuſes of their Churches. He forbad alſo the diſſolution of Monaſteries, or any ſeizure to be made on the Eſtate of the Church, and any perſon or perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to change, or alter his or their Religion. And for the better ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and contentment of the Proteſtants, that in thoſe points which were ſtill under Controverſie, he left every man free, and at liberty in his own judgment; and farther, that ſuch Monaſteries as were not yet demoliſhed, ſhould ſtill remain, but howſoever ſhould be reduced to a Godly and Chriſtian way of practice. That the Goods of the Church ſhould not be ſeized, but left for maintainance of the Miniſters without any diſtinction or difference relating to their Sect in Religion. He alſo prorogued the Aſſembly at <hi>Auſburg,</hi> until ſuch time as the points there in Controverſie could come to the deciſion of a General Council, or a Diet of the Empire.</p>
               <p>After this the Emperor paſſed into <hi>Italy,</hi> and at <hi>Luca</hi> met the Pope, where in a long diſcourſe he treated at large concerning a Council, and the management of a War againſt the <hi>Turks</hi>; the reſult of which was this, That the Pope ſhould ſend a Nuntio into <hi>Germany,</hi> to adviſe the Diet which was to be held at <hi>Spira</hi> on the beginning of the next year following, and aſſure them of his reſolution to aſſemble a General Council at <hi>Vicenza</hi> at the time formerly prefixed. But in regard this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was under the Dominion of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the Pope thought fit to intimate firſt this intention to the Senate, before he ſignified this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50681:266"/>
at <hi>Spira:</hi> the which was adviſedly conſidered, for the <hi>Venetians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the propoſal, being jealous of the ill conſequences, which the concourſe of ſuch multitudes might produce to their State; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they had lately made a Peace with the Sultan, they apprehended, that a Treaty and Conſultation held in one of their Towns, for uniting in a Confederacy againſt him, and carrying on a War, might be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Rupture, and breach of the Peace, which lately they had with great charge, and much labour concluded: upon which anſwer from the <hi>Venetians</hi> the Pope was forced to take other meaſures. In the mean time the Cardinal <hi>Coutarini</hi> lay under the ſevere cenſure of the Pope, having been accuſed, for behaving himſelf with too much eaſineſs at <hi>Regenſburg</hi> in matters which concerned the intereſt of the Church, for that he ſeemed as if he had been a little ſhaken, and ſtaggered with the ſubtil Arguments againſt the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation, and heard with too much indifferency, the diſcourſes which tended to the diminution of the Papal Authority. But the Cardinal <hi>Fregoſa</hi> being his friend, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him in deſpight of all his enemies, until ſuch time as returning to the Pope at <hi>Luca,</hi> he rendered ſuch an account of all matters tranſacted in his Embaſſy, as gave the Pope entire ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>This was the ſtate of Affairs towards the end of the year 1541. when at the beginning of 1542. the Pope diſpatched <hi>John Mora</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Modena</hi> to the Diet held at <hi>Spira,</hi> under <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors brother, giving them to underſtand that the Pope continued his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of holding a General Council, which he had for ſome time defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in expectation of that good iſſue which it was hoped the Diets, and National Conventions would have produced in the ſettlement of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but ſeeing that thoſe means had failed, he now again re-aſſumed his former deliberation about a Council, which he ſhould gladly cauſe to be aſſembled in <hi>Germany,</hi> were not the fatigues of ſo long a Journey, and the alteration of Air dangerous to a perſon of his age: and therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had thought of <hi>Mantoua, Vicenza, Ferrara, Bologna,</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> for places proper and convenient for ſuch a Convention; He did at length pitch upon <hi>Trent</hi> as a City without exception, being ſituated on the Frontiers of <hi>Germany,</hi> and therefore did now unalterably appoint a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil there to be opened on the 13th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> next enſuing, deſiring all thoſe there preſent at this Diet that they would lay aſide all Animoſities and Factions, and appear at this Council with clear and ſincere ſouls to favour the cauſe of God, and the truth of the Goſpel. Upon this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the other Princes which favoured the Cauſe of the Roman Church, returned their thanks to the Pope, ſaying, that ſince there was no City in <hi>Germany</hi> judged convenient for this Council, that they were contented with this aſſignment of <hi>Trent,</hi> where they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to come, and there to be aſſiſtant. But the Proteſtants refuſed to accept of this intimation, alledging that the Pope had neither Authority to indict a Council, nor that <hi>Trent</hi> was a place convenient for it; which was the cauſe that no farther reſolution was taken hereupon at this Diet.</p>
               <p>Howſoever the Pope proceeded forward in his intention, and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his Bull dated the two and twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> for aſſembling a Council at <hi>Trent</hi> to meet on the firſt of <hi>November</hi> following; the which was diſpatched from <hi>Rome</hi> to all the Princes of Chriſtendom, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great ſucceſs. For in the month of <hi>July, Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50681:266"/>
had denounced War againſt the Emperor, having in a <hi>Manifeſto</hi> publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed his reaſons for it in ſuch ſevere terms, as greatly reflected on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the Emperor, and which ſo much provoked him to anger in that ill humor wherein he was newly returned from his unhappy adventure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Algier</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> that when the Bull was delivered ro him, he gave this anſwer; that he was in no manner ſatisfied therewith; in regard that it made no diſtinction in the terms, and ſtile thereof between him and the King of <hi>France</hi>: for tho he had refuſed no pains, nor ſpared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to compaſs the aſſembling of a Council; and that the <hi>French</hi> King on the contrary had endeavoured by his Embaſſadors at <hi>Spira</hi> to nouriſh diſcords, and ſo to embroil the affairs of Religion, as to put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a condition beyond all hopes, or poſſibility of accommodation; yet this Bull treated the diſſervices of the <hi>French</hi> with the ſame equality of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as it did the unwearied zeal of Him the Emperor, whoſe great incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence it had always been to render faithful, and effectual Offices of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Church: And then rehearſing the many provocations the <hi>French</hi> King had given him, he deſired the Pope to conſider, if the Behaviour of that King towards him did correſpond with a deſign, or intention of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the intereſt of Chriſtendom, or did appear with ſuch a face, or guiſe of Peace, and Reconciliation, as was neceſſary at ſuch a time when a General Council was to be convened; of which we may then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the moſt promiſing aſſurances of ſucceſs, when it commences with Candor, Friendſhip, and Charity, which are the beſt, and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſitions towards the eſtabliſhment of truth, and peace. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>French</hi> King hath ever countermined, and diſturbed this courſe, ſome other way, was to be found for the ſettlement of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beſides a Council; and in the mean time he deſired that the Pope would attribute the diſappointment thereof to the <hi>French</hi> King only, to whom it was neceſſary, that he ſhould declare himſelf a publick enemy, in caſe he ever hoped to expect good from a Council, in the ſettlement of Peace, and Religion in the world. The <hi>French</hi> King being well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that the War which he had commenced at this unſeaſonable time, would certainly be interpreted, as prejudicial to Religion, and as if he favoured the Proteſtant cauſe; did therefore, to foreſtal ſuch ſuggeſtions, publiſh moſt ſevere Edicts againſt the Proteſtants; forbidding them to aſſemble at any Meetings, cauſing all their Books, written in defence of their Doctrin to be burnt, and enjoyning the Sorboniſts to make ſevere inquiſitions concerning ſuch, who obſerved not Fiſh days, or days of Abſtinence, or ſaid not their Prayers in Latin, or in any manner contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, or withſtood the Principles, or Doctrins of the Catholick Church. Moreover, he wrote an Apology for himſelf to the Pope in anſwer to what the Emperor had accuſed him of; recalling to memory the hard and ſacrilegious uſage which he had practiſed againſt <hi>Clement</hi> VII. how he had ſacked <hi>Rome,</hi> and impriſoned the Pope, and at the ſame time in a moſt hypocritical manner, illuding God Almighty, had made Proceſſions at <hi>Madrid</hi> for the Pope's deliverance, when he himſelf was the ſole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of his confinement: farther purging himſelf of being any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or hinderance to the proceedings of a Council, or giving an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to the quiet, and ſettlement of Religion.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Pope, that he might ſhew himſelf the common Father of Chriſtian Princes (on which title he laid the great ſtreſs of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50681:267"/>
deſired to interpoſe himſelf, as Mediator of their differences; and to that end, diſpatched Cardinal <hi>Contarini</hi> to the Emperor, and Cardinal <hi>Sadoler</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King; but <hi>Contarini</hi> dying in his journey, Cardinal <hi>Viſeo</hi> was conſtituted in his place, who being a perſon not very accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Emperor, was not a proper inſtrument to effect the Pacification intended. Howſoever, tho the War proceeded, and that acts of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were committed in divers places, yet the Pope proſecuted the deſign of a Council, judging it his honor to be now poſitive, as to the time and place, and accordingly towards the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> he ſent three Cardinals, <hi>viz. Peter Paul Pariſio, John Morone,</hi> and <hi>Reginal le Poole</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> to be his Legates, for preparing matters in order to the Council, which was appointed to be holden at <hi>Trent:</hi> beſides whom, many other Biſhops were ſent, who were all men of excellent Learning, and ſubtil Diſputants; but the Proteſtants refuſing to meet at that place, by virtue of the Pope's Authority; theſe learned Doctors became all of one ſide, and finding none to make oppoſition againſt them, they might with much facility have confirmed, and eſtabliſhed what Fundamentals and concluſions they had pleaſed. But as yet things were not prepared for any publick Act, nor had the Legates Inſtructions as yet to conclude any thing, but only entertain the Prelates, and Embaſſadors which were ſent thither. The appearance at firſt was very thin, and few Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had ſent their Miniſters to <hi>Trent</hi>; howſoever the Emperor tho he entertained little hopes of a good iſſue of theſe proceedings, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved for prevention of Plots, or Deſigns againſt him to ſend <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Granvel</hi> to be his Embaſſadors at that place; who being arrived, preſſed the Pope's Legates to proceed to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that their time might not be there conſumed to no purpoſe; which the Legates endeavouring to evade, and ſtill to put delays, and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the way, it was ſo diſpleaſing to the Emperor's Miniſters, that they proteſted againſt thoſe delatory excuſes; to which the Legates gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no anſwer, <hi>Granvel</hi> was recalled, and ſent to reſide at the Diet at <hi>Noremberg,</hi> which was opened about the beginning of the year 1543. ſo that nothing moved forward in this Council by reaſon of the many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and eſpecially of the fierce War, which now grew very hot between the Emperor, and the <hi>French</hi> King, and of the Plague which was begun at—ſo that after ſome few Seſſions to little purpoſe, the Council was by order of the Pope adjourned to <hi>Bologna.</hi>

And therefore departing from <hi>Rome</hi> on the 26th. of <hi>February,</hi> and not regarding the coldneſs of the ſeaſon, which was inconvenient to one of his age, he travelled through the Dominions

of the Church, and taking <hi>Modena, Reggio, Parma, Ferrara, Ancona, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugia,</hi> and <hi>Viterbo</hi> in his way, he at length came to <hi>Bologna,</hi> where he remained until the middle of Summer, when <hi>Charles</hi> V. arrived at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> where he was received into the Palace of Prince <hi>D'Oria,</hi> prepared for him in all Royal and ſumptuous manner; he was there complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſeveral Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly by <hi>Pier luigi Farneſe,</hi> whom the Pope had expreſly ſent to the Emperor, intreating him to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign a time, and place where the Pope might have diſcourſe with him in order to ſome matters of great concernment. The Emperor who was preſſed to make all the ſpeed poſſible into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and had reſentment of things which he took unkindly from the Pope, made ſeveral excuſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pretending that his Affairs would not permit him the leiſure for ſuch a meeting; and that in caſe the Pope's buſineſs were exhortations to Peace and Reconciliation with <hi>France,</hi> the matter was too far gone for him to afford any ear thereunto, until he had firſt received ſome revenge, and compenſation for the injuries which had been offered him. <hi>Pierluigi</hi> not ſucceeding in this requeſt, the Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> was immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in poſt to <hi>Genoua</hi> to urge the Emperor with more preſſing inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and being a perſon very eloquent and importunate, he prevailed with the Emperor to meet, and diſcourſe with the Pope at <hi>Buſetto,</hi> a place between <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and <hi>Cremona</hi>; provided that this interview ſhould not retard him in his journey, for above the ſpace of three days. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Pope came to <hi>Buſetto</hi> on the 20th of <hi>June,</hi> and the next day alſo the Emperor arrived, when falling immediately upon buſineſs, the Emperor would by no means hearken to the propoſition which was made him for inveſting his Nephew <hi>Ottavio</hi> in the State of <hi>Milan</hi>; and tho a ſum of mony was offered for it, which the preſent neceſſities did greatly require; yet being ſupplied with two hundred thouſand Crowns by agreement with <hi>Cormo de Medicis,</hi> whereby he releaſed to him all the Fortreſſes of the State of <hi>Florence,</hi> he would upon no terms give ear to the propoſition concerning <hi>Milan</hi>; which when the Pope perceived, and that his arguments, and importunities for it, were all inſignificant; he turned his diſcourſe to matters of more publick concernment, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to conſider the preſent ſtate of the Church, which was torn in pieces by diverſity of Sects in Religion, which took their advantage of thoſe confuſions, which the Wars between him, and <hi>France</hi> had cauſed; and farther he repreſented to him the great danger in which his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was engaged by the formidable forces of the <hi>Turk,</hi> which threatned <hi>Hungary</hi>; in conſideration of all which, he begged of him to put an end to his Wars againſt Chriſtians, that he might repreſs and give a ſtop to the violent incurſions of the common enemy: all which diſcourſe had no other effect, than only, that hereupon <hi>Julio Or<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Now began the year 1544. which was very remarkable for the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Peace concluded between the Emperor and the <hi>French</hi> King, on the 18th. of <hi>September</hi> at <hi>Creſpy,</hi> a Caſtle in <hi>Valois,</hi> after the bloody Battel of <hi>Ceriſoles:</hi> the which was received with extreme joy by all the Chriſtian Princes, and eſpecially by Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> who being returned from <hi>Bologna</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> had lately made ſolemn Proceſſions for the Peace and quiet of Chriſtendom; the which unexpected news ſurpriſing the Pope, was interpreted by him, as a return of thoſe Prayers and Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, he had made for Peace, tho inwardly he conceived ſome ſecret reſentments, that he had not been concerned as Mediator in it. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this news of Peace, the Pope thought it ſeaſonable to publiſh an other Seſſions of the Council to Commence in <hi>March</hi> following, which had on occaſion of the late Wars been prorogued: but this haſty indiction of a Council was not pleaſing to the Emperor, who expected to have been firſt conſulted; eſteeming that it had been more agreeable to his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and more acceptable to the humor of <hi>Germany,</hi> had he been made the principal Author of this Council: Howſoever that he might ſeem to be the firſt mover of the work, and the Pope only to act in the ſecond place, he iſſued out many Commiſſions to the Prelates of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and to many Divines at <hi>Lovain,</hi> to meet together, and conſider of ſeveral Theſes, and Propoſitions which were to be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Council, which being reduced to ſix and thirty Heads, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired their ſolution of them poſitively, without any proofs, or referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Holy Scripture. All which ſolutions being made, were confirmed by the Emperor's Magiſterial Authority, and Edicts, requiring all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to yield entire faith,<note place="margin">Hiſt. <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </note> and belief thereunto. And farther, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror not being able to conceal the diſpleaſure he had conceived againſt the Pope, vented his choler frequently to the Nuntio in very ſevere and ſharp terms: and whereas the Pope in the month of <hi>December</hi> had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thirteen Cardinals, thoſe three which were <hi>Spaniards</hi> amongſt them were forbidden by the Emperor to accept the Dignity, or to take the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, or wear the Habit.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1545.</note>Tho the Emperor had teſtified this open diſpleaſure againſt the Pope, yet he ſo far complied with him, as to ſend <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza,</hi> who had lately been his Embaſſador at <hi>Venice,</hi> with ample Commiſſion to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as did alſo the other Princes who were in amity with the Pope: but the Proteſtants who had ſent their Commiſſioners to the Diet at <hi>Worms,</hi> over which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> preſided in the place of the Emperor, refuſed to ſend their Embaſſadors to <hi>Trent,</hi> alledging, that the Aſſembly held at that place, was not legitimate, nor could be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the quality, and character of a General Council. The Pope being highly incenſed at this refuſal, and ſeparation of the Proteſtants, which he eſteemed an affront to the Papal Authority, diſpatched his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew the Cardinal <hi>Farneſe,</hi> in quality of Legate, with ample inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Emperor; wherein beſides ſome other particular intereſts, he encharged him moſt eſpecially to incite the Emperor to make a War of Religion againſt the Proteſtant Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which he conceived the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50681:268"/>
greater hopes, in regard that by frequent advices from his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> he was aſſured of the diſpleaſure, and diſdain the Emperor had of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Cauſe, and that he willingly gave ear to thoſe ſuggeſtions which adviſed him to compel their Aſſents, and Compliance by force of Arms. To this Propoſition, the Emperor made anſwer, that he acknowledged this Counſel which the Pope gave him to be good, and almoſt neceſſary, and which he reſolved to follow; but howſoever, that it was to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with its due caution; and that a Truce was firſt to be concluded with the <hi>Turk,</hi> which was ſecretly treating: and then that ſome diſcords, and diſſentions were to be ſowed amongſt the Proteſtant Princes; for that being united together, their numbers were ſo formidable, and great, that inſtead of maintaining the Catholick Religion, he ſhould put it into apparent danger, and hazard, which a doubtful ſtate of War may produce.</p>
               <p>This Treaty, tho ſecretly carried, was yet ſuſpected by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes, who took a moſt ſenſible alarm from the Sermon of a Cordelier Frier that preached one day before the Emperor, King <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> and the Legate, and uſed many invective Speeches againſt the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans:</hi> he told the Emperor plainly, that it was his duty to defend the Church by force of Arms; and that God had put the Sword into his hands for extirpation of this Hereſie, and deſtruction of this peſt of mankind, which he ought not to ſuffer to live in this world. This Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and diſcourſe made great noiſe, being interpreted for the ſenſe of the Legate, and to be an effect of the Treaty which he ſecretly held with the Pope, and that the Frier Preached in that manner by his order; wherefore to abate, and ſurceaſe thoſe reports, the Cardinal departed ſecretly by night, and with all expedition returned into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Debates at the Diet at <hi>Worms</hi> proceeded, where the Emperor in perſon endeavoured to perſuade the Princes to contribute towards a War againſt the <hi>Turk</hi>; which they abſolutely refuſed to do, until aſſurance were given them, that the Peace between them and the Emperor ſhould be continued, and maintained without any reſpect to the determinations, and concluſions at <hi>Trent,</hi> which they could not eſteem a General Council, or to have any Power and Authority to oblige them to an obſervation of thoſe Decrees, and Canons which were formed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: to which the Emperor replied, that he could not aſſure them of Peace, or obſervation of any Articles, which ſhould exempt them from the determination of that Council, to which all Chriſtians were obliged to ſubmit; and that he ſhould not know how to to excuſe himſelf to other Kings and Princes, in caſe he ſhould endeavour to procure that exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for <hi>Germany</hi> only, from obedience to the Council, which was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convened, in reſpect, and in order to the ſettlement of their Affairs. With which this Diet was diſſolved on the 4th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and an other publiſhed to be held in the month of <hi>January</hi> following at <hi>Regensburg.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1546.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner time paſſed without any iſſue or determination of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes: the Proteſtants refuſed to own or acknowledg the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> to be lawfully Convened; and the Pope could not ſuffer the Points of Religion to be debated in the Diets of <hi>Germany,</hi> which were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the Secular Authority. So that the Pope publiſhed a Jubily to be held at <hi>Rome</hi> on the 15th. of <hi>July,</hi> 1546. in the Bull for which, after he had amply ſet forth the great care and pains he had uſed for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Hereſie, which could not be compaſſed by any other human

means, than by a General Council: yet ſuch was the obſtinacy of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, that they contemned, and ſlighted its Sentence, and denied Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to its Authority: And therefore as the laſt remedy, and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate prevention of theſe growing evils, he declared, that he was forced to make a League with the Emperor, that he might by force of Arms, reduce thoſe to the Church, who were by no other more gentle means capable to be reclaimed from their Hereſies and Rebellion: for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of which, he exhorted all good Catholicks to have recourſe unto God by Prayers, Faſtings, Confeſſions, and Communion.</p>
               <p>The Emperor on the other ſide, on the 20th. of the ſame month, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Remonſtrance againſt the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Landgrave of <hi>Heſs</hi>; in which, omitting to mention any particulars about Religion, he charged them with diſobedience to his commands, and oppoſition to his deſigns; that they had made Alliances, and entered into Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration with other Princes of the Empire againſt him; that they had ſeized Biſhopricks, and Eccleſiaſtical Benefices into their own hands, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſpecious pretences of Religion, Peace, and Liberty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that as ſeditious Rebels, Traitors, and Diſturbers of the publick Peace he reſolved to proceed againſt them; abſolving the Nobility from their Oath of Allegiance to them, and requiring the people to withdraw themſelves from their Obedience, not to joyn with them, nor afford them any aid, ſuccor, or aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Tho the Pope and the Emperor were joyned in the ſame League, and intended the ſame thing; yet the motives for this War mentioned in their Remonſtrances were diſpleaſing to each other, as not correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their mutual intereſts: for the Emperor was unwilling to have this War ſtiled a War of Religion, leſt that denomination ſhould engage a ſtronger, and a more numerous party than he was able to Maſter: the Pope howſoever was deſirous to have it ſo named, and believed, that the Emperor having to contend with a numerous, and formidable Enemy, his Power might be attempered, and his Greatneſs reduced to ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable equality in the Ballance of Chriſtendom.</p>

Howſoever the Emperor gained the Victory, the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> being wounded, and taken Priſoner, and his whole Army defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and in a few days after the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe</hi> by mediation of <hi>Maurice</hi> his Son-in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>law, and the Duke of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion came in, and preſented himſelf before the Emperor.

provided he would ſubſcribe, and oblige himſelf to other Articles.

By which great Victory the Emperor becoming abſolute Maſter of all <hi>Germany,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained much Cannon and Artillery, and exhauſted great ſums of mony from the Towns and Countries which were in ſubjection to thoſe Princes, whom ho had conquered, he was arrived to that pitch of heighth, and greatneſs which the Pope could not gladly allow; and in this condition, for ſecurity of the peace, and quiet, and for the better regulation of the Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Emperor aſſigned a Diet to be held at <hi>Auſbourg.</hi>

               <p>Upon the firſt news of this Victory, the Pope to outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſeemed to be tranſported to an extremity of joy; and thereupon immediately diſpatched away the Cardinal <hi>Francis Sfondrato</hi> with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulatory Letters for the ſucceſs of this Victory, ſtiling the Emperor <hi>Invictiſſimus, &amp; Maximus Imperator.</hi> Howſoever his ſecret thoughts did not correſpond with theſe external Demonſtrations; for ever ſince the denial which the Emperor had made of inveſting his Nephew in the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> he had conceived a grudg againſt him, which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, until this time, when his diſpleaſure being exalted with a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie that the Emperor by this ſucceſs would aſpire to the abſolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Italy</hi>; and obſerving with what little regard the Prelates of the Empire had comported themſelves, during the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> towards the Papal Authority: and reflecting farther, that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obtain from the Emperor the confirmation of his Son <hi>Pier-luigi,</hi> in the States of <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> which he had conferred upon him; he could not longer ſuppreſs theſe reſentments, but vented with all the ſpight imaginable many reproaches againſt <hi>Charles,</hi> ſaying, that out of malice to him, he had joyned himſelf to <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. King of <hi>England,</hi> who was condemned of Hereſie, and Excommunicated from the Church. In which paſſion he prorogued the Council, which in compliance with the Emperor he had called at <hi>Trent,</hi> to be now transferred, and held at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna</hi>; for which he ſeemed to have received ſome juſt motives from the Behaviour of certain Prelates, who having banded themſelves into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſeemed to intend ſomething in diminution of the Popes Dignity, and Prerogative: to prevent which, all thoſe Prelates which ſided with the Pope, pretending that the Air of <hi>Trent</hi> was too ſharp for them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to <hi>Bologna</hi>; from which place the Emperor was not able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the Pope, with all the excuſes and intreaties he could uſe.

               </p>

Peace in <hi>Germany</hi>; but in regard the point of Religion was the cauſe of all their Troubles, whenſoever that came into queſtion it occaſioned great Commotions. For the Eccleſiaſtical Electors, or ſuch as belonged to the Church did deſire, and urge that an entire, and abſolute refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all things ſhould be given to the Council at <hi>Trent,</hi> without any reſerve, or condition. The Secular Electors who adhered to the Doctrin of <hi>Luther</hi> were contented alſo to refer the matters in diſpute to the Council, provided that neither the Pope, nor any other deputed from him, ſhould preſide thereat; and that the Council ſhould be free, and holy, and that what Biſhop ſoever was thereunto admitted, ſhould be abſolved from any Oath he had taken, which might render him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Papal Sea.</p>
               <p>During the time of this Diet at <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> the Pope remained in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual trouble of ſpirit, not knowing what thoſe Seſſions might produce. During which on the 10th. of <hi>September,</hi> advice was brought him, that his Son <hi>Pier-luigi</hi> Duke of <hi>Piacenza</hi> was murdered in his own Palace by certain Gentlemen who had conſpired againſt him, and who in an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious manner had thrown his Body into the Streets to be a ſpectacle to the people: and in a few hours after ſeveral Troops arrived from <hi>Milan</hi> by order of <hi>Ferrand Gonzaga,</hi> Governor, to take poſſeſſion of the City. The which unhappy fate, and violent death of a Son, as it ſenſibly touched the Pope with natural grief; ſo the loſs of ſo fair a City did ſerve to augment the ſence of this miſchief, which by all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, did appear to have been perpetrated by the knowledg, and contrivance of the Emperor.</p>
               <p>This unexpected outrage cauſed great conſternation at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and gave interruption to the proceedings of the Council at that place; for the Pope in his great affliction could not bend his thoughts to any tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions there; only he forced his mind to read the particulars of what was debated, and concluded at <hi>Ausbourg,</hi> which were twice a week diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched thence by an expreſs: the which Diet being held until the year 1548.<note place="margin">1548.</note> with various diſcourſes, and arguments, and nothing as yet concluded: But being the general ſenſe of all that it was neceſſary for the common quiet of <hi>Germany</hi> to center at length in ſome reſolutions, and that ſuch reſolutions tending to a compoſure could not be expected from the Council which was now transferred from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Bologna,</hi> at leaſt during the Reign of this Pope; wherefore it was propoſed to make choice of ſome few perſons to whom the care of this work ſhould be committed; but not being able to agree in the perſons to be elected, the choice was remitted ſolely to the Emperor, who at length pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three perſons, namely <hi>Julius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Emperor in a Diet had given new forms of Faith, and Religion, the Title Page of this Book was qualified by an <hi>Interim,</hi> that is, that the ſame Heads, and Points contained in that Book ſhould be no longer Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick, or eſteemed Catholick, or obliging Doctrins, than until ſuch time as the ſame ſhould be altered, and changed by the more unerring determinations of a General Council, to whoſe judgment they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. When this Book came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Pope was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, it cauſed great conſternation and noiſe. The Clergy exclaimed highly, That a Temporal Prince in an Aſſembly compoſed only of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, ſhould adventure to handle all matters and Points of Religion: upon which the Learned Men, and ſuch as were read in Hiſtories, called to mind the <hi>Henoticon</hi> in the time of <hi>Zenon,</hi> the <hi>Ectheſis</hi> in the time of <hi>Heraclius,</hi> and the <hi>Typus</hi> of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> who were Emperors; and the Schiſms, and Diviſions in the Church cauſed by the Imperial Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions relating to Religion, with which they compared, and adjoyned this <hi>Interim</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> V. And farther, that which gave the greateſt cauſe of fear, was, leſt this <hi>Interim</hi> ſhould be an Introduction to a greater Change; and that the Emperor intended this compliance with the Proteſtant Doctrins, to be a prelude, or a preparative to a total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> after the manner, and example of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. King of <hi>England,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope, who was wiſe, and accuſtomed to diſſemble matters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſuch time as he was able to remedy, or revenge them, reflecting with mature conſideration on this preſent emergency, did make an other judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof than appeared to ordinary underſtandings; for he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that this new Formulary did tend more to the prejudice of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror than to the Eccleſiaſtical State: wondering greatly that a Prince of ſo much Prudence, ſhould ſo far be elated with his late Succeſſes, as to believe himſelf able to be the Arbitrator, and Moderator of all mankind; or to be in a capacity by his ſingle Intereſt to oppoſe both the great, and prevailing parties in the world. It was poſſible for a Prince adhering to one of them to ſuppreſs the other; but to oppoſe both at the ſame time, would be a match unequal. For the Pope wiſely foreſaw that theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins for the moſt part would be as diſpleaſing to all Catholicks in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and would be no leſs contradicted by the Proteſtants; ſo that being oppugned on all ſides, it would conſequently fall by the contrariety of Factions. To which end, the Pope ſeeming in himſelf little concerned, did yet under-hand ſuggeſt jealouſies in the minds of the <hi>German</hi> Prelates; the which being dexterouſly inſinuated by the Cardinal <hi>Sfodrato</hi> the Popes Legate, who according to his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions gave in a memorial to the Emperor, repreſenting the ill foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequences of this new Formulary of Doctrins, and then took his leave, and departed, that he might not be preſent, when the ſame was publiſhed. In ſhort, this matter ſucceeded according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pope: for tho the Emperor did moſt ſtrictly forbid, and inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit any perſon to oppugn the Doctrins contained in this Book of <hi>Interim,</hi> either by Practice, Writings, or Preaching: yet notwithſtanding the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants on one ſide did not forbear to refute this Confeſſion of <hi>Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> by their publick Writings, and Diſputations: and on the other <hi>Francis Romeo</hi> General of the Dominican Friers did by command from the Pope appoint ſeveral Learned men of that Order to refute that

Formulary of the <hi>Interim:</hi> In <hi>France</hi> alſo many wrote againſt it, and in a ſhort time great numbers both of Catholicks and Proteſtants oppugned it with heat of argument, it having hapned in this matter as in others of the like nature, that where middle terms, or moderate expedients have been propoſed between the extremes of oppoſite Factions for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating or reconciling their differences; there the event hath been no other, than that the contrary parties have impugned the expedients, and both have been hardned, and confirmed in their own Tenents, and Opinions.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1549.</note>Theſe debates and troubles gave a ſtop to the proceedings of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Bologna,</hi> for the ſpace of two years; and until almoſt the end of the year 1549. when at the beginning of <hi>November</hi> news came to the Pope then at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Duke <hi>Ottavio Farneſe</hi> his Nephew, (who having againſt his own inclinations been detained by the Pope at <hi>Rome,</hi> out of tenderneſs to his life, leſt he ſhould incur the ſame fate, as <hi>Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luigi</hi> had done) was privately eſcaped out of the City, and was then actually dealing with <hi>Ferdinand Gonzaga</hi> the Governor of <hi>Milan</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate him in <hi>Parma,</hi> in deſpight of <hi>Camillo Orſino,</hi> who was to keep and defend the Town in right of the Eccleſiaſtical State. The which news ſo ſurpriſed the mind of the Pope with ſenſible grief, and commotion of ſpirit, who was not as yet recovered of the ſorrow he had conceived for the fate of his Son <hi>Pierluigi</hi> that he preſently fell into a ſwound, or <hi>Leipothymie,</hi> from which being revived, was ſeized by ſo violent a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that in three days he died thereof, being the 10th. of <hi>November,</hi> at his Palace of <hi>Monte Cavallo,</hi> where he uſually reſided, becauſe it was eſteemed a place of the beſt Air in <hi>Rome.</hi> He had held the Papal Sea 15 years, and 28 days, and was arrived to the age of 81 years, eight months, and 10 days: He was buried in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church without any great pomp, or State; and afterwards the Sea was vacant two months, and 29 days.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Cardinals having (as accuſtomary) celebrated the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Obſequies of the Pope deceaſed, for the ſpace of nine days, did on the tenth enter into the Conclave; but then conſidering the ſmall appearance of Cardinals, few being then preſent, the formal receſs and retirement into the Conclave was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred for ſome time. And here it is to be obſerved, that the Cardinals were divided into three Factions; the firſt favoured the Emperor; the ſecond was inclined to the <hi>French</hi> King; and a third conſiſted of ſuch Cardinals as had been the creatures of the late Pope deceaſed, and by him promoted to ſeveral Benefices, and Dignities; the Cape, or chief of which, was Cardinal <hi>Farneſe,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, who tho young, was yet active, ſubtil, and of a judgment ſolid, and of as good experience in the Court, as could be expected in a perſon of his years. This laſt party as it was numerous, ſo it was compoſed of ancient Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, men of great authority and knowledg in the world, and ſuch as
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50681:271"/>
were able to bear down the ballance in favour of any perſon, to which they inclined; for which reaſon great courtſhip was made to Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> both by the <hi>Imperial,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Miniſters; whoſe arguments on both ſides were ſo forcible to draw him to their party, that being doubtful unto which he ſhould incline, reſolved on a neutrality, as the ſafeſt courſe whereby to ſteer, tho in reality, he ſeemed on occaſions to lean moſt to the <hi>French</hi> party.</p>
               <p>This was the ſtate of affairs at <hi>Rome,</hi> when about the beginning of the month of <hi>December</hi> 1549. the Cardinals entered into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave: <hi>Farneſe</hi> in the firſt place propoſed to his own Party, the choice of Cardinal <hi>Poole,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, a perſon, againſt whom for the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of his extraction, his godlineſs, and exemplary life nothing could be objected: and being alſo acceptable to the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to no party, he found many friends ready to give their Votes for him, amongſt which the moſt conſiderable were the Cardinals of <hi>Trent, Sforza,</hi> and <hi>Creſcentio,</hi> who had drawn alſo <hi>Morone,</hi> and <hi>Maffei</hi> to their Party; who being all men of conſiderable intereſt did agree immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to preſent him in the Conclave, and aſſume him to the Papal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But ſome of the old Cardinals, who ſeemingly aſſented thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, yet being inwardly envious to ſee a younger man preferred over their heads, did adviſe to delay the time for a while, leſt the Election which ought to be mature and grave, ſhould ſeem to have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſty, and precipitate, tho in reality this delay was cauſed by that hopes which every one entertained of being himſelf the perſon that ſhould be elected: by which means the choice of <hi>Poole</hi> being until the next day ſuſpended, the contrary party, ſuch as <hi>Monti, Ceſis,</hi> and <hi>Gaddi,</hi> who were all Pretenders, and Candidates, had time to make their Parties; Cardinal <hi>Salviati</hi> labouring all the night for the excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Poole.</hi> The next day the Cardinals being aſſembled in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to the number of 49. Cardinal <hi>Fortone</hi> one of the <hi>French</hi> Faction publickly accuſed <hi>Poole</hi> of Hereſie, and for that reaſon proteſted againſt his choice. Howſoever his Friends eſteeming his report falſe, and ſcandalous, preſſed forward the ſcrutiny; in purſuance of which, the Votes being put into a Chalice, 26 were found in favour of <hi>Poole</hi>; but in regard that 33 at leaſt out of 49 were required to make the Election legitimate, <hi>Poole</hi> was excluded, to the great diſappointment of himſelf, and the <hi>Imperial</hi> Party, who eſteemed the choice to have been ſecure and certain. In relation hereof I have been the more large, becauſe it concerned one of our Country-men, and may have reference to ſome particulars which are to follow.</p>
               <p>After which, ſeveral other Cardinals experienced their fortunes; but to no effect, the Factions being every day more heated, and embroiled, ſo that they could not come to any agreement: at length they reſolved to nominate nine perſons, out of which the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> might chooſe one that was moſt acceptable to them. The perſons propoſed were three <hi>French</hi> men, <hi>viz. Lorene, Tornon,</hi> and <hi>Bellai</hi>: three <hi>Italians, Salviati, Ridolfi,</hi> and <hi>Trani:</hi> and three <hi>Imperialiſts, Theatino, Monti,</hi> and <hi>San Marcello,</hi> againſt whom nothing was objected; excepting <hi>Monti,</hi> whom Cardinal <hi>Ghiſa</hi> accuſed of a wicked life, publiſhing many Vices of which he was guilty, and rendering him unworthy of the Prieſthood and Holy Orders, into which he was entered. Howſoever at length the Cardinals
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50681:272"/>
growing weary with ſo long a continuation of the Conclave, reſolved generally to adhere unto <hi>Monti</hi>; to which alſo Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, laboured with all his power to reconcile <hi>Ghiſa,</hi> and <hi>Monti,</hi> which after ſome words, and ſecret conferences together being happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; all parties concurred in the Election, and on the ninth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1550. <hi>Monti</hi> being accompanied by 42 Cardinals deſcended into the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> where being ſeated in the Chappel of S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> all the Cardinals paid their reſpects and obedience to him, which they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, as was uſual, by kiſſing his feet; which being finiſhed, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf by the name of <hi>Julius</hi> III. in memory of <hi>Julius</hi> II. from whom he derived the beginning of his greatneſs. He was afterwards crowned by Cardinal <hi>Cibo,</hi> on the 21. of the ſame month of <hi>February.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Reign began with the year of Jubilee 1550. the which in its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular courſe ought to have commenced the <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> before: but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Chair was then vacant, that ſolemnity was deferred until the 24th. of <hi>February,</hi> being the Feſtival of S. <hi>Matthias,</hi> when the four Gates were opened, according to the accuſtomed manner, and great numbers of people flocked from all parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> who having viſited the four princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Churches, namely S. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lateran,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, S. <hi>Paul</hi>s, and S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> the Great, received the Indulgences, Privileges, and Abſolutions, which are the fruits and rewards of that Devotion; with which this Holy Year ended on the day of the Epiphany of the year following. Amongſt the other Pilgrims, which were but few in number from the Weſtern parts, by reaſon of the Wars, and confuſions about Religion; <hi>Stephen</hi> the Patriarch of the greater <hi>Armenia</hi> in company with an Arch-Biſhop and two other Biſhops came to <hi>Rome</hi> to gain the Jubilee. This people who had been always of the Eaſtern Church, and ſubmitted to their own Supreme Patriarch called, were perſuaded by the Miſſionaries from <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> III. to ſubmit to the Roman Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſes of Preferments and increaſe of their Revenue; in which Faith they have ever ſince continued, adhering to all Points of that Church; tho perhaps little regard hath been had to an augmentation of their Benefices; for I have been acquainted with one of their Patriarchs accompanied with two Dominican Friars, who were ſo poor, that in their Travels to <hi>Rome,</hi> they have begged Alms to defray their charges.</p>
               <p>During this year of Jubilee, and the firſt of his Reign, the Pope In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the Council which <hi>Paul</hi> III. had transferred to <hi>Bologna</hi> to be held at <hi>Trent,</hi> and to begin in <hi>May</hi> following. <hi>Charles</hi> V. was then at the Diet of <hi>Augſburg,</hi> when this Bull of the Pope was delivered to his hands, which he cauſed to be promulged in the hearing of all the Princes, who were preſent at the Diet. In obedience to theſe ſummons, ſome of the Biſhops of <hi>Germany, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> attended and made their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal appearance; to which place alſo the Pope ſent Cardinal <hi>Creſcentio</hi> to reſide as his Legate, aſſiſted by the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sipontino,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Verona:</hi> and being deſirous to perform acts of Favour and Grace ſoon after his Inauguration, he beſtowed twenty Cardinals Hats, amongſt which he gave one to a Youth of thirteen years of age, called <hi>Innocent de Monte,</hi> born at <hi>Piacenza,</hi> one of poor and mean Parentage, whom he received and adopted by that name into his Family, none knowing the ground or reaſon for it, which gave a large and copious Theme to the Paſquils at <hi>Rome.</hi>

                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:50681:272"/>About that time <hi>George Martinuno,</hi> who governed the Affairs of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> during the minority of that King, was at the inſtance and requeſt of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> created Cardinal by this Pope <hi>Julius</hi>; but he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſecretly plotting and conſpiring with the <hi>Turks</hi> againſt the Prince, who was under his charge and tuition, upon diſcovery and proof made of his treacherous deſigns was juſtly put to death. This Pope who was of a pacifick temper, and naturally inclined to peace, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo farther inducements thereunto by the long experience he had in the affairs of the Church, which he had obſerved to thrive, and proſper moſt with the lenitives of peace, rather than by Arms, and Slaughter, which were incongruous and diſſentaneous to thoſe principles on which the Church was originally founded: howſoever the Pope contrary to theſe principles was unhappily forced, and engaged in a War on this occaſion, which we ſhall here relate, with as much brevity as we are able. <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, after <hi>Piacenza</hi> was loſt, and his Son <hi>Pier-luigi</hi> ſlain, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the charge and defence of <hi>Parma</hi> to <hi>Camillo Orſino</hi> (who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted a great Soldier in his time) to keep and defend that City in the name and behalf of the Church, ſtrictly commanding him not to reſign or entruſt that care into any other hands, without expreſs and poſitive Commiſſion. <hi>Paul</hi> being dead, and <hi>Julius</hi> III. being in treaty for the Succeſſion, promiſed Cardinal <hi>Farneſe,</hi> who (as we have ſaid) was Chief of a powerful Party, to deliver <hi>Parma</hi> into the hands of his Brother <hi>Ottavio,</hi> in caſe he would favour him with his Vote, and Intereſt; which he aſſenting unto, and <hi>Julius</hi> being made Pope, the conditions were complied with; the Commiſſion of <hi>Camillo</hi> being vacated, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the City ſurrendred to <hi>Ottavio:</hi> provided notwithſtanding that it ſhould not be in the power of <hi>Ottavio</hi> to conſign the City into the hands of any Prince whatſoever, without the knowledg, licenſe, and conſent of the Pope: and that <hi>Ottavio</hi> might be the better enabled to maintain the Garriſon againſt the force, and temptation of the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts,</hi> a ſtipend was allowed him of 2000 Crowns a month. In a ſhort time <hi>Ottavio</hi> finding that the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> were preſſing upon him, and that he was not able to defend the City againſt <hi>Charles</hi> V. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out greater ſupplies both of men, and mony, deſired the Pope, that he would either augment his Allowance, or elſe give him the liberty to joyn, and enter into Alliance with ſome other Prince, that was able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and defend him againſt the artifices, and violences of the Emperor. The Pope not penetrating the depth of the matter, without due, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſideration anſwered, that confiding in his prudence, he gave him licenſe to provide for his ſafety in ſuch manner, as he thought moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient. <hi>Ottavio</hi> taking theſe words in the largeſt ſenſe, and ſuppoſing he had obtained licenſe to do, and act as he pleaſed, agreed privately with <hi>Henry</hi> II. King of <hi>France</hi> to receive a <hi>French</hi> Garriſon into <hi>Parma</hi>; which being done, and the Pope too late complaining thereof, as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concluded without his knowledg or permiſſion; and alſo apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Emperor would certainly believe that this was acted by his aſſent, and concurrence, that he might diſabuſe the world, and perſuade the Emperor to the contrary, he baniſhed Cardinal <hi>Alexander Farneſe</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> and calling the Emperors Forces to his aſſiſtance, made War upon Duke <hi>Ottavio</hi>; ſo that all <hi>Italy</hi> on a ſudden began to be embroiled and enflamed with War. For <hi>Parma</hi> was preſently beſieged by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando

Gonzaga,</hi> who was Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> under the Emperor; and by <hi>Angelo de Medici</hi> Legat for the Pope: and in the mean time Monſieur <hi>de Thermes</hi> General of the <hi>French</hi> Forces was raiſing Men in <hi>Mirandola,</hi> and making preparations of Ammunition, and proviſions for a War, and <hi>Peter Sirozzi,</hi> and <hi>Oratio Farneſe</hi> Captains of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King made incurſions as far as <hi>Bologna,</hi> ſpoiling, and laying waſte the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round about; wherefore the Imperialiſts having joined the Popes Army laid ſiege to <hi>Mirandola,</hi> ſo that <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Mirandola</hi> were both beſieged at the ſame time: in this manner the War continued for the ſpace of a whole year without any memorable action on either ſide, onely fire, and ſword, and miſerable devaſtations raged in all parts of <hi>Italy</hi>; of which the Pope being touched with an inward compaſſion, and being naturally inclined to Peace, having began this War more in compliance with the Emperour, than his own humour or affections, or with intention to poſſeſs himſelf of <hi>Parma,</hi> did at the inſtance of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>French</hi> Cardinals make a Peace, with which the Siege was raiſed both from before <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Mirandola:</hi> howſoever with this accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation on the Popes ſide, the Wars did not end between <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, but being continued from one year to another produced nothing but ſlaughter, ruin and miſeries to their People. In the mean time the Pope having proclaimed, that the Council held at <hi>Bologna</hi> ſhould be transferred to <hi>Trent,</hi> commanding by his Indictions, and Bulls, all Patriarchs, Arch-Biſhops, and Biſhops to repair thither, and having ſent thither Cardinal <hi>Creſcentio</hi> to preſide as his Legat, together with his two Aſſiſtants before named, the eleventh Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions was commenced on the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> 1551.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1551.</note>Howſoever, before it could be agreed to transfer the Council again to <hi>Trent,</hi> many, and ſerious Debates were held thereupon, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Paul</hi> the third for adjourning it to <hi>Bologna</hi> being very forcible, it had ſtill been continued there had not the conſiderations of pleaſing the Emperour prevailed, which in that conjuncture was eſteemed neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary: and alſo it was reſolved, that all the Acts, and determinations which had been concluded, and agreed in the former Seſſions ſhould be eſteemed authentick, and ratified, and not farther to be called into queſtion, or debate either in any Diet, or in this Council: for which reaſons the Proteſtants refuſed to appear at <hi>Trent,</hi> alledging that the place was neither ſecure for them, nor the Council free in ſuch manner, as that every one might deliver his Sence, and debate his Opinions; and that unleſs the concluſions made in the Council might be again exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and that the Divines, who compoſed the Confeſſion of <hi>Augsburg,</hi> might have a Deciſive, as well as a deliberative Voice, and that unleſs the Pope not being permitted to preſide in the Council, the Biſhops might be abſolved from their Oath, which obliges to the Papal Sea, and ſuffered freely to give their own true, and real Sentiments, it could not be expected, that any happy reſult ſhould iſſue from this Council, and therefore they were reſolved to abſent themſelves, and not give their attendance according to the citations and ſummons from the Pope. Wherefore the Emperour entering into a cloſer Treaty with the Eccleſiaſtical Electors, and others inclining to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> adviſed them to attend perſonally the General Council to which all due, and humble obedience was to be given, promiſing them all ſecurity,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50681:273"/>
and ſafety both in going and returning; For as he was in the quality of Emperour, ſo he was Advocate of the Church, and the Defender of Councils, the which Office that he might be in a better capacity to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, he would take up his reſidence at ſome place on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; where he would be aſſiſtant to their Liberty, that every one might have a freedom to propoſe, and ſpeak what he in Conſcience judged moſt agreeable to the Word of God, and the Doctrine of the Ancient Fathers.</p>
               <p>This Declaration of the Emperour ſeemed to be made, and erected as a Battery, or Counter-work to the Popes Bull. For whereas the Pope pretended to govern, and direct Councils, the Emperour reſolved to take the care, and charge to ſee them orderly, and regularly directed. The Pope pretended to preſide, and to be himſelf the Rule, and have the caſting Voice; and the Emperour commands that all Deciſions be made according to Scriptures, and the Holy Fathers. The Pope directs that the concluſions made at former Seſſions ſtand in force, the Emperour leaves them free to be diſputed, and debated as every Mans conſcience directed: In ſhort, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> not being able to digeſt theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, complained much of the encroachments which the Emperour made on the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, and that his Declaration was an other Convocation of a Council.</p>
               <p>The Emperour having declared his reſolution to grant his Paſſes, and ſafe conduct to all ſuch, as ſhould go to this Council. The Proteſtant Princes began to diſcourſe in all parts of <hi>Germany</hi> of ſending the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, and learned Men amongſt them to <hi>Trent:</hi> and accordingly <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> commanded <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and other Divines of ſingular note, and reputation to repair thither. In like manner the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> provided others of equal Learning; but conſidering that a ſafe Conduct, or Paſſeport from the Emperour was not ſufficient, as had been formerly experienced at the Councils of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi>; the Emperour was deſired by thoſe Princes to obtain by the means of his Ambaſſadours ſafe conducts, under the publick Seal of the Council: which the Emperour promiſed to do, and accordingly gave order to Count <hi>Monfort</hi> one of his three Ambaſſadours reſiding at <hi>Trent</hi> to procure the ſame, the which afterwards gave occaſion of much Debate, and Diſpute in what manner, and with what Expreſſions it was to be formed.</p>
               <p>The Pope though to outward appearance ſeemed very deſirous to have the Council commence and be continued at <hi>Trent</hi> according to the time appointed: yet did not ſeem much concerned, or greatly preſſing to have the Catholick Prelats aſſemble: onely the Emperour ſeemed moſt urgent, conceiving the determinations of a Council to be the onely means to quiet, and appeaſe the diſturbances in <hi>Germany</hi>; and therefore inſtantly preſſed the Electors of <hi>Cologne, Triers,</hi> and <hi>Metz</hi> together with ſeveral Biſhops of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſuch as were in his Dominions of <hi>Italy</hi> to haſten their Journey unto <hi>Trent:</hi> ſo that during the ſpace of eight months, that the Council continued, the whole Aſſembly of Perſons actually preſent comprehending alſo the Preſidents, and Princes did not exceed the number of ſixty four.</p>
               <p>Time being protracted unprofitably from the firſt of <hi>May</hi> to the firſt of <hi>September</hi>: a Seſſions was then held: at which it was declared,<note place="margin">1651.</note> that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50681:274"/>
conſidering the ſmall appearance of Biſhops by reaſon of the abſence of the <hi>German</hi> Nation; the Seſſions of the Council had been until that time deferred. But now in regard that two of the Electors were already come, which gave hopes, that many others of the ſame Country would follow their example, and ſpeedily attend the Summons of the Holy Council; it was reſolved in expectation thereof to adjourn for the ſpace of forty days, that is from the firſt of <hi>September</hi> to the eleventh of <hi>October.</hi> At which time theſe particular Articles would be then treated, and diſcuſſed. Firſt of the Sacraments in general: and next of Baptiſm, the Euchariſt, and confirmation in particular: After which the Count <hi>de Monfort</hi> made a Speech in behalf of his Maſter the Emperour; and ſeveral Commiſſions and Letters of Credence from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Princes were publickly read by the Secretary of the Council.</p>
               <p>After which <hi>Amiot</hi> Abbot of <hi>Belloſane</hi> preſented a Letter from <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, directed to the Council, and delivered to be read by the Secretary; the Superſcription whereof was this, <hi>Sanctiſſimis in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto Patribus Conventus Tridentini.</hi> Againſt which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelats took great exception, cryed out with a loud Voice, That that Letter was not directed to them, who were a General Council, and not an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, as that Superſcription would inſinuate, and therefore deſired that the Letter might not be read, but that in caſe the Bearer had any thing to propoſe from his Maſter, he might be heard by a Committee, or at ſome private Houſe: the word <hi>Conventus,</hi> gave great Scandal, and an occaſion of much noiſe and diſturbance; until ſuch time as the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Metz</hi> riſing from his Seat, asked them, how they would be able to admit audience to the Proteſtants, who ſtiled them <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Malignantium,</hi> when they ſo ill reliſhed the title of <hi>Sanctiſſimum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventum:</hi> howſoever the <hi>Spaniards</hi> continued their Exclamations until the Legat and his Aſſiſtants together with the Emperours Ambaſſadors reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a while into ſecret Conference, returned again, and gave their aſſent to have the Letter read, being willing to have the word <hi>Conventus</hi> taken in the largeſt and moſt favourable ſenſe. The Contents and ſubſtance of which Letter dated the 13th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> was to this effect. That the King out of due reſpect to that Council, and according to the cuſtom of his Anceſtors had thought fit to ſignifie to them the reaſons why he had not ſent any of his Biſhops to that Aſſembly convened by Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the 3d. under the title of a <hi>General Council</hi>; the which was cauſed by the Obligation he had upon him both in juſtice, and honour to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>; for which cauſe there being a neceſſity laid upon him of making War againſt the Pope, and the Eccleſiaſtical State, there could be no ſecurity or ſafety either to his Ambaſſadours, or Biſhops in any Dominions of the Church, whileſt this miſunderſtanding between him, and the Pope remained: and therefore he hoped they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this, as a juſt reaſon and excuſe, to whom he appealed as favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and impartial Judges in the caſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After the Letter a Proteſt was read, containing all the Particulars, of which Mounſieur <hi>de Termes</hi> Ambaſſadour for <hi>France</hi> complained at <hi>Rome</hi> to the Pope, in name of the King, the ſubſtance whereof was this: That having taken upon him the protection of <hi>Parma,</hi> he had endeavoured to repreſent his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it to the Pope, and Cardinals; giving them to underſtand, that his principal Motives thereunto were reaſonable, pious, and Royal, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50681:274"/>
ſuch as had no mixture of intereſt, but purely reſpected the welfare, and benefit of the Church; as might appear by the Articles of agreement with <hi>Parma,</hi> which onely reſpected the Church, and the peace and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Italy:</hi> of which having informed the Pope, his Holineſs ſeemed not willing to underſtand the ſame, ſeeming more inclinable to gratifie his own humour, than prevent thoſe miſchiefs which would embroil all <hi>Europe,</hi> and interrupt the proceedings of the preſent Council, which he could not eſteem, or ſtile with the Character of General, but of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Convention, aſſembled onely to ſerve a turn, and promote private intereſts; ſo long as he who was the moſt Chriſtian King, and the eldeſt Son of the Church was excluded thence; not being able to ſend his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours or Biſhops thither with that ſecurity to their Perſons, and freedom in their Votes, as was required in a General Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Proteſt being read, the Anſwer thereunto was deferred until the eleventh of <hi>October.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time this Proteſt afforded matter of Diſcourſe to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom: ſome were of Opinion that the Pope hereupon would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to diſſolve the Council, which could have no Authority, or be termed General, ſo long as the <hi>French</hi> Nation, which was a principal Member was excluded from it: But the Pope was of another Opinion, pretending that his ſincere endeavours of perſuading that Nation to join themſelves to it, was ſufficient: and the Imperialiſts, who cared not much for their Company, judged that ſcruple immaterial; ſince that being cited, and required to appear thereat, as members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church; their cauſeleſs, and obſtinate abſence ought not to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the proceedings of the Council; for in regard the greater part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Minor; the whole body of <hi>France</hi> was obliged to own thoſe Acts of the Council to be Canonical, and Obligatory, having by their abſence, when they might have been preſent, or by their ſilence aſſented thereunto.</p>
               <p>Howſoever the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> was of an other Judgment: for tho it be true that the greater number carries the point, in thoſe Aſſemblies, where is a common concurrence in Votes: But where one part abſents it ſelf, and refuſes to joyn, the Acts of the other cannot oblige the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Party, and in that caſe that Rule takes place, <hi>Prohibentis potior eſt conditio</hi>; of which nature are all ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies which how numerous ſoever they may be, their Acts have onely an Authority to oblige their own Countries, but not ſuch as have diſſented, or are not concurring with them: which was the ſenſe and Opinion of ancient times, as we may read in the Treatiſes wrote by S. <hi>Hilarius, Athanaſius, Theodoret,</hi> and <hi>Victorinus</hi> expreſly upon this Point: for which reaſons certains Canons have been received in ſome Churches which have been rejected in others: and as St. <hi>Gregory</hi> teſtifies, that upon the ſame account, the Canons of the ſecond Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and of the firſt of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were not received by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But leſt the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould by this manner of Nonconformity ſeem Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, or be ſuſpected of an intention to alienate the minds of his People from the Catholick Religion; he publiſhed divers ſevere Edicts againſt the Proteſtants; promiſing rewards to ſuch, who ſhould detect, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:50681:275"/>Now according to the Promiſe made to the Abbot of <hi>Bellozare,</hi> that an Anſwer ſhould be given to the Letters and Proteſt of the <hi>French</hi> King his Maſter on the eleventh of <hi>October</hi> following; the Cryer of the Council at the Church-gate, made Proclamation, that in caſe any were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for the moſt Chriſtian King, he ſhould then appear. But the Abbot knowing well, that no Anſwer would be given him, but ſuch as was forged at <hi>Rome</hi> by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Party, had by Order from his Maſter the King withdrawn himſelf; wherefore none appearing to receive and hear the Anſwer, Order was given to have the Anſwer which was prepared for that time to be publickly read in the Council, the ſubſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was this; That the Council was not conſcious of having given any ſuch offence to his Majeſty, that he ſhould have cauſe to paſs ſuch hard Cenſures upon it: that it had been at firſt convened by the Authority of <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d. and now continued under this Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> and therefore could not be ſuſpected of having had it's original from any private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of advancing particular intereſts, as his Majeſty would inſinuate, and therefore they deſired his Majeſty would be pleaſed to ſend his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to the Council, that they might concur in this holy Work, which was carried on with no other aim, than a juſt and a ſincere intention to ſettle Religion on its true baſis, and to produce peace and quietneſs in the World: Adding farther, That in caſe his Majeſty ſhould upon any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conſiderations, or animoſities decline this happy Union denying the pretence and attendance of his Miniſters at this Sacred Aſſembly; that yet notwithſtanding they were well aſſured that all thoſe Acts perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, would have the ſame force, and Authority obligatory upon Men's Conſciences, as if his Majeſty had by the preſence of his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours and Biſhops concurred therein.</p>
               <p>Nor did the <hi>French</hi> King onely deny to ſend his own Subjects to the Council, but alſo prevailed with the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> and <hi>Griſons</hi> by his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours to do the like, who being well acquainted with the ſecret Deſigns and Intrigues of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> inſtilled that prejudice in their minds to this Council; that as well Catholicks, as Proteſtants then aſſembled in a Diet at <hi>Baſil,</hi> denied and diſclaimed all concurrence with that Council, and as an evidence thereof recalled <hi>Thomas Plant</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Coire</hi> from thence.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe difficulties, and oppoſitions the Council proceeded in their Decrees, and determined eleven Points with <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> againſt all ſuch, who ſhould not cloſe in faith and in belief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Firſt, againſt thoſe, who ſhould deny the very Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt together with his Soul, and Deity to be really and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially contained in the Euchariſt; but confeſs it to be only in ſign, or figure, or myſtically: the which converſion of the Elements of Bread and Wine, into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, they called <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi> Secondly, againſt thoſe, who ſhould hold that the whole Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt is not contained in one of theſe two Species; Thirdly, againſt thoſe who hold, that the Body and Blood of Chriſt is then onely contained in the Species when the ſame is received, and not before, or after. Fourthly, againſt thoſe, who hold, that the chief fruit, and benefit of this Sacrament is the remiſſion of ſins. Fifthly, againſt thoſe, who hold, that Chriſt in the Euchariſt is not to be adored with the Service of <hi>Latria,</hi> or carried in Proceſſion, or publickly expoſed to Worſhip and Adoration. Sixthly, againſt thoſe, who being come to the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50681:275"/>
age of diſcretion ſhall not communicate once a year, and that at <hi>Eaſter</hi>; with five other Points relating to the Sacrament, all which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed as irrevocable, and immovable fundamentals, of which it was not lawful to doubt, much leſs to diſpute. Theſe and other Points being already paſſed in the Council, were taken as granted, and concluded, and therefore were not to be again re aſſumed to Debate: But now in regard the matter of the Paſsports to be given to the Proteſtants, was again to be conſidered, it was judged fit, that the Tenure thereof ſhould be reſtrained with prudent cautions, that when the Diſſenting Party ſhould intermix with their Aſſembly, it ſhould not be in their Power to unravel thoſe Doctrines which had been already ſetled, and determined; but giving them for granted, ſhould proceed to examine other Points of leſſer moment, which they limited to four Articles. Firſt, Whether it were neceſſary to Salvation that Chriſt's faithful People ſhould receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt in both kinds. Secondly, Whether he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives in one kind alone, receives leſs than he that communicates in both. Thirdly, Whether the Church be guilty of an Error in having ordained, that the Laity ſhould communicate in one kind only. And then Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Whether the Sacrament of the Euchariſt may be given to Children. Theſe Points of limitation being thus laid down, the Preamble to the Paſsports ran in this manner; That whereas the Proteſtants did deſire to be heard upon theſe Points before they were finally determined, and for the end they might have free and ſafe admiſſion to this Council, without any let, hinderance, or interruption whatſoever: It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the Authority of this Council ordered, and enacted, That out of a deſire, and zeal they had to reduce the erring Chriſtians into the true way of the Goſpel, they did with humble charity condeſcend unto their Demands, giving, and granting unto them the publick faith, and aſſurance to come, and repair freely to this Council, and there to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of the preceding Particulars, Provided that they came, and gave their perſonal attendance there in Council, at, or before the 25th. of <hi>January</hi> next following, and in the mean time that the Points being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently debated and diſcuſſed, might be prepared and made ready for determination againſt the end of that Month.</p>
               <p>The Tenour of this Paſsport being read, and conſidered by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, appeared ſtrangely captious, and ſuch as gave them juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of aſtoniſhment and admiration; for conſidering that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants had not onely in all their Diets, but in all their publick Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances and Writings avowed their reſolutions to hear all matters in Diſpute to be examined in their preſence, and that without ſuch perſonal intercourſe and conſent, they would never receive or obey any Precepts or Articles which ſhould be enjoyned, or impoſed upon them from <hi>Trent:</hi> it ſeemed ſtrangely magiſterial and ſurprizing, that the Council ſhould aſſume a liberty to ſay, that the Proteſtants deſired to be heard onely upon thoſe four Points; it being moſt evident that the Deſign of the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was no other than to delude unthinking Men by a fair appearance of invitation, and ſafe Conduct, and yet keep the Authority of the Pope, and of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church upon its guard and reſerve; wherefore the Proteſtants rejecting the allurements of ſuch feigned Diſguiſes, by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agreement reſolved not to repair unto the Council, unleſs it were under the protection of ſuch a ſafe Conduct as was given be the Council
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50681:276"/>
of <hi>Baſil</hi> to the <hi>Bohemians:</hi> one Clauſe of which was, That the Holy Scriptures ſhould be the Judg of all Controverſies; which in caſe they could not obtain, they might have wherewith to excuſe themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperour.</p>
               <p>The Pope having underſtood theſe reſolutions of the diſſenting <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> more earneſtly urged the coming of the Catholick <hi>Suiſſes</hi> to the Council, with whom alſo the Emperour joyned in the Invitation; but the <hi>French</hi> King had ſo charmed them by his Ambaſſadours, who being a Perſon well verſed in all the Intrigues and contrivances of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> had wrote a Treatiſe on that Subject, ſufficient to create in them a Diffidence and jealouſie of the <hi>Roman</hi> Counſels, and ſo expoſed the Deſigns intended againſt them, that not onely the Proteſtant, but alſo the Catholick <hi>Swiſſers</hi> did at a Diet held at <hi>Bade</hi> unanimouſly concur not to ſend their Deputies to <hi>Trent,</hi> by which the <hi>Griſons</hi> alſo taking an Alarm, conceived a jealouſie, that ſome thing was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at <hi>Rome</hi> to their prejudice, and for that reaſon recalled <hi>Thomas Plant</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Coire</hi> from his reſidence with the Council.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe matters were in Treaty two Ambaſſadours from the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> arrived at <hi>Trent,</hi> whoſe Commiſſion was publickly to repreſent the Confeſſion of their Doctrine before the Council, giving them to underſtand, that in caſe they would admit their Divines to a Debate, and grant them a free Paſsport as large and ample in the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of it, as was that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> that then they ſhould appear in the Council, and expound and explicate their Doctrine, and Tenents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true ſenſe and meaning of them: but before theſe Divines were admitted, it was ordered by the Legat, that they ſhould firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and make known to the Preſident the Summary of their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that ſo it might be conſidered whether the particulars therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained were ſuch as were lawful, and which might be regularly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Council, which was the method of their proceedings. But the Ambaſſadours whoſe Inſtructions were, not to own, or acknowledg the Authority of the Pope, or power of convoking, or preſiding in Council either in Perſon, or by his Deputies, could not be perſuaded to make applications to the Preſident, being a matter contrary to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Article reſolved in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1551.</note>About the ſame time alſo being the beginning of <hi>November</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour arrived at <hi>Inſpruck</hi>; which being a City not above three days journey from <hi>Trent,</hi> was for that preſent made the place of his reſidence, that ſo he might with more eaſe receive daily Advices of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Council, and be more near at hand to adminiſter aſſiſtance to his Wars at <hi>Parma.</hi> The news of the Emperours near approach did not much diſturb the thoughts of the Pope, who depended on the rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated Promiſes which the Emperour had made him of being firm, and ſteady to the intereſt of the Church, and the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> But to the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> he ſtudied not much to give a Reply, or new Inſtructions to his Legat; but onely recommended to him a firm conſtancy in defence of the Papal Authority, which having in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> the third convened that Council, and which had by the ſame Power been ever ſince continued; he ought not in the leaſt Point give way to ſchiſmatical, and ſeditious motions: but with courage and zeal, defend the Right and Title which the Pope ſingly had both to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:50681:276"/>
and to preſide as Head in all Eccleſiaſtical Councils. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours having continued at <hi>Trent</hi> without being heard, preſſed very earneſtly for a Diſpatch, and that their Doctrines might be read in the Council, and a ſafe Conduct granted to their Proteſtant Brethren accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the form of that given at <hi>Baſil,</hi> that ſo they might have liberty to deliver their Doctrines, and Argue, and Diſpute in maintenance thereof without interruption, or danger to their Perſons. But the Legat would not yield to either of the Propoſitions; ſaying, That as to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, they were already notified in their own Books, and lay before the Council to conſider, and either to approve, or condemn them; and that the Cenſure given ought to be concluſive, and received with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſubmiſſion, as a final Determination. And whereas they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that their Doctrines ſhould be read in the Council, it ſeemed as if the Diſſenters intended to give Laws, and Precepts, and teach the Church what was Orthodox, and what Erronious: And as to the form of the Paſsport in any other latitude than what had lately been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, it ſeemed ſo inſufferable an indignity to the Council, and to the Church of God to have their former reſolutions queſtioned, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unravelled, that all good Chriſtians were obliged to engage their Lives for the prevention thereof.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time the City of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and five other Towns ſent their Ambaſſadours to <hi>Trent</hi> with the like Orders to repreſent their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines before the Council; who finding the ſame repulſe, did jointly addreſs themſelves to the Emperour, complaining, that contrary to the Promiſes of his Imperial Majeſty their Doctrines could not be read in the Council, or received into conſideration: but the Emperour being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to content them, acquainted them that the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Saxony</hi> were ſhortly expected, and that when they came, they ſhould have a fair hearing, and be admitted to a charitable, and friendly Conference.</p>
               <p>On the ſeventh of <hi>January</hi> 1552.<note place="margin">1552.</note> the Ambaſſadours from <hi>Maurice</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> arrived at <hi>Trent</hi> to the great joy of the other Electours, and Prelats of <hi>Germany,</hi> who uniting together in the ſame Intereſt made their firſt Addreſſes and applications to the Emperor's Embaſſadours: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them that their Princes, being deſirous to cultivate Union, and Charity amongſt Chriſtians, had ſent their Divines to the Council, who were moderate Men, learned in the Law and Goſpel, and ſuch as were lovers of Peace, and Chriſtian Charity, and that all the other Proteſtant Princes would in like manner ſend their Miniſters to the Council under the protection of ſuch a Paſsport, or ſafe Conduct, as had been granted at <hi>Baſil,</hi> Provided, that all matters, and Points already Determined might be again examined, and called into queſtion: and the Pope not admitted to preſide as Chief of the Council, but be equally liable to the Sentences, and Cenſures of the ſame with other Biſhops. And in the mean time their deſire was to be admitted directly to the Council with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intermediate Addreſſes to <hi>Creſcentio</hi> the Pope's Legat; and that in publick Aſſembly their Commiſſions might be read, and their Doctrines expoſed to publick conſideration: But theſe Propoſals, though gently received and hearkned unto by the Emperour's Ambaſſadours, who were unwilling to diſoblige the Electours of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> were violently oppoſed by the Pope's Legat, and Nuncios; who alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was a matter of high indignity to the Council, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50681:277"/>
the Church Catholick, to have their Decrees, and Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons canvaſſed, and reverſed by an inconſiderable number of Sectaries, who ſeemed to come prepared and armed rather to confound, than eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Council: for ſeeing that their Principles were, to diſown the Pope's Authority, on which that Council was founded; and then to be admitted to a freedom of Speech, in which they might vent their bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous Doctrines, and reproaches to the diſhonour of the Apoſtolical See, was ſuch an Indulgence to Impiety, and a betraying the Power of the Church, as rather than admit, were ready to ſacrifice their lives, or at leaſt withdraw from any Meetings, where ſuch matters were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, or Acts Decreed. But notwithſtanding theſe poſitive refuſals, the Emperor's Ambaſſadours endeavoured to induce the Pope's Party to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Diſſenters to audience in the Council; for that their very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to it did imply a tacite owning of the Pope's Authority, though the uſual Ceremonies, and Compliments which were but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Points, were pretermitted by them, the which would be an act moſt religious, and Chriſtian, for perhaps ſuch charitable condeſcenſion would be a means to prevent a War, which might endanger the ſafety of the whole Church: to which the Cardinal of <hi>Toledo</hi> one of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Party, farther added: That he had often heard in Sermons, how that the ſalvation of one Soul was ſo dear, and precious to Jeſus Chriſt, that for the ſaving thereof he would deſcend on Earth, and be again crucified; and then, ſaid he, let us conſider, if we imitate this example, in caſe for the ſaving of all <hi>Germany,</hi> we ſhould deny to recede from the leaſt punctilio of our honour, and prerogative. At length, to be ſhort, after many Debates, and conſultations in deſpight of the Legat and his Adherents, the Authority of the three Electours, and the Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drutio</hi> promoted by the mediation of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Ambaſſadors prevailed.</p>
               <p>But then another difficulty aroſe concerning the treatment of theſe Ambaſſadours when introduced to the Council, with what place, and precedency was to be granted to them; and how, and where the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines were to be ſeated, who expected a rank, and freedom of Voice, and ſuffrage equal with others; which ſeemed very dangerous to be yielded to known Hereticks, who by Antient Canons, and Papal Decretals were never admitted to a Communion or Society with other Chriſtians, unleſs having firſt renounced their Errors, they deſired with humility to be taught, and directed: this Point though at firſt diſputed with the ſame difficulties as the former; yet at length it was concluded: That the neceſſity ought to excuſe the tranſgreſſion of ſuch Canons, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mature deliberation had been diſpenſed within all the Diets of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>; and that the like might be ſafely practiſed at this Council; in caſe that in the Preamble to this Admiſſion, it were declared, that ſuch Indulgence was yielded out of charity, and compaſſion, to the end that Men who were gone aſtray, and fallen into error might be reclaimed, and reduced to the true Faith, and Orthodox Doctrine of the Church. And though the Legat would not yield to any of theſe means of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, yet it was concluded againſt him; that on the 24th. of this month of <hi>January</hi> a General Convocation ſhould be held, at which the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Saxony</hi> ſhould be received, and heard; and that in the mean time the Divines who remained at ſome diſtance from <hi>Trent</hi> might repair thither, and that the 25th. ſhould be the day of Seſſion;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50681:277"/>
which being agreed, a Committee was choſen to draw up this Decree, together with the Preamble to the Admiſſion, and the ſafe Conduct.</p>
               <p>The Imperial Miniſters having made this report to the Proteſtants, and ſignified in an eloquent Speech the tenderneſs the Council had for them, and willingneſs to condeſcend to their weak Conſciences: the Proteſtants retired a while, and having conſidered the minutes of the ſafe Conduct; made their exceptions to it, being in four particulars dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> formerly granted to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and on which they were obliged by their Inſtructions to inſiſt. As firſt, That in Council they might have a Vote, and free ſuffrage. Secondly, That the holy Scripture, and practice of the Primitive Church, Antient Councils, and Fathers who were Expoſitors of the Scriptures might be the Judges of all Controverſies. Thirdly, That all Ambaſſadours du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the continuance of the Council, might have the free Exerciſe of their Religion in their own Lodgings. Fourthly, That nothing ſhould be ſaid, or acted which might tend to the defamation of their Religion, or render it ridiculous. Theſe particulars being offered to the Council, were generally concluded to be unreaſonable, and ſuch as might enſnare their wiſdom in inextricable difficulties; and therefore it was reſolved not to change, or alter any thing in the Minutes of the Safe Conduct, in expectation that the Proteſtants obſerving their reſolution and conſtancy might with time be induced to condeſcend to their terms.</p>
               <p>Matters being thus protracted till the 24th. of <hi>January</hi> the General Convocation was held at the Houſe of the Legat, where the Electors, all the Fathers, and the Emperor's Ambaſſadours were preſent; who having taken their Places, the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Saxony</hi> were called in, who having made their Reverence, and Salutes to the Aſſembly, one of them began his Speech, with this Compellation, <hi>Reverendiſſimi, &amp; Ampliſſimi Patres, &amp; Domini</hi>; My Lord and Maſter <hi>Maurice</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> after his hearty Wiſhes, and Prayers, that God would inſpire all your Counſels with his Holy Spirit, hath commanded me to let you know, that he hath a long time deſired to ſee a General, Chriſtian and free Council held, and celebrated, wherein all Errors might be refuted, and abuſes in the Church corrected, and reformed; and that the Holy Scriptures might be made the Rule of our faith and practice: in which good work that he might be aſſiſtant, he hath ſent his Divines to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their Confeſſion to this Council, being commanded to abide at ſome Leagues diſtant until a ſafe Conduct could be procured for them; for having underſtood, that according to a conſtitution of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> it was not neceſſary to keep faith with Hereticks, or thoſe who were ſo reputed; and that the <hi>Bohemians</hi> being ſenſible of ſuch Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, had with due caution armed themſelves with aſſurance of ſafe Conduct under the Seal of the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi>; ſo in like manner his Maſter the Elector did deſire and expect the ſecurity of ſafe Conduct for his Divines, Counſellors and their domeſtick Servants in a more ample, and large form than what appeared in that Draught, and Copy which had lately been preſented to him. Which requeſt being granted, and admiſſion given to the Divines to take their place in Council, his next Propoſition was to have them heard upon thoſe Points, and Articles, which were in Controverſie between the Proteſtants, and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; and though the ſame had already been determined by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50681:278"/>
yet that they might again be reviſed, and examined, and determined by the Word of God, and according to the common belief of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Nations.</p>
               <p>After theſe Ambaſſadours had finiſhed their Oration, thoſe of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg</hi> were introduced, who having delivered their Meſſage almoſt to the ſame intent, and purpoſe with the former they were cauſed to retire; and after a Debate whether any addition, or alteration ſhould be made in the form of Safe Conduct, it was generally concluded in the Negative, leſt by giving the liberty propoſed, the Council ſhould be intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued in moſt inextricable Diſputes, of which Volumes had been wrote alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without hopes of arriving at any definitive Sentence or Determination.</p>
               <p>The next day being the 25th. of <hi>January</hi> which was the day of the Seſſion, all things were managed with great Order, and Solemnity; and after Maſs was ended, the Council ſat, and in the firſt place determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all points relating to the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and Sacrament of Ordination, that thoſe material Points might be paſſed before the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Proteſtants, in expectation of whom (as was then declared) and in hopes that they came provided with real, and peaceable inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to acquieſce in the truth, and confirm the Decrees of their Mother the Church, and not to ruine, and deſtroy its fundamental Principles, they had prorogued their next Seſſion until the 19th. of <hi>March</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and as to the form of the Safe Conduct it appeared to them ſo large, and ample that nothing could be deviſed, or imagined to render it more extenſive, or of greater validity.</p>
               <p>With this, and the like tenderneſs of brotherly compaſſion the Council ſeemed to outward appearance to treat the Proteſtants, though the chief motive thereunto, was to pleaſe the Emperor, who apprehending great confuſions, and Wars in <hi>Germany,</hi> on the ſcore of Religion was earneſt by all the Sollicitations his Miniſters could make to bring matters to ſome tolerable accommodation. The Emperor alſo being deſirous to abate ſomething of the Authority and arrogance of the Church, imagined that the Proteſtants might be made uſe of, as the happy Inſtruments to effect the ſame, and that the depreſſion of the Papal Power might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the grandeur of the Imperial. The Pope, and his Party diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe ſecret agitations did after this laſt Seſſion think little of the farther proceedings of the Council, and therefore on force of this jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie entertained private Treaties with <hi>France</hi> managed by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Tournon</hi> in behalf of that King, in purſuance and execution of which it was believed, that an entire, and abſolute diſſolution of the Council would neceſſarily follow of it ſelf, without any Act of the Pope therein.</p>
               <p>Howſoever theſe matters not as yet diſcovered; the Proteſtants te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified their diſlike of the Narrowneſs of the Paſsport, as not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that amplitude, which their Princes required. And alſo obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the general Congregation proceeded to prepare all matters in Controverſie concerning Marriage, adoration of Images, worſhip of Saints, Purgatory and the like, which they called Minute Points, to be offered againſt the next Seſſion, all which were to be paſſed without the intervention of the Proteſtants, they took juſt offence againſt the proceedings, and complained thereof to the Emperor's Miniſters: of which alſo the Emperor himſelf taking notice, diſpatched an Expreſs both to <hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> giving them notice, that this haſty precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50681:278"/>
of Affairs gave juſt cauſe to ſuſpect, that nothing was intended fairly towards the Proteſtants, who on theſe due and reaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments would become more obdurate in their Opinions; to prevent which, he laid his Commands on the Prelats not to act, or join in any farther proceedings; which reſolution being ſignified at a General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, all Synodical actions and Decrees were ordered to ſurceaſe, until the pleaſure of the Council ſhould be known to the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Pope being greatly incenſed at this, and other actions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, gave licenſe to this Prorogation for a few days onely, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they ſhould again aſſemble, and reaſſume their Debates with ſuch Chriſtian fortitude as became their Eccleſiaſtical functions, without reſpect to any worldly conſideration.</p>
               <p>During this vacation a Frier preaching on the Parable of the Tares ſowed amongſt the Wheat, applyed that Doctrine to the preſent diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Opinions, which he called <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and which ought, (as he ſaid) to be extirpated with fire, and the gallows; at which and other affronts the Proteſtants taking particular exceptions greatly complained of their ill uſage, which tended to make the breach wider; and the Elector of <hi>Triers</hi> took this pretence to depart, feigning alſo an excuſe of his health; though in reality a ſecret intelligence which he held with the <hi>French</hi> King was the cauſe thereof.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of <hi>March</hi> the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Saxony</hi> received Letters from their Prince to proſecute their Demands with new inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the Council, giving them to underſtand, that for the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual diſpatch thereof, he intended perſonally to wait on the Emperor; which was cauſe of great amuſement to the Papal Party: but in a few days, it was generally bruited, that a League was made between the <hi>French</hi> King and the Proteſtant Princes to make War upon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; which news giving an Alarm to the Electors of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tz</hi> and <hi>Cologne</hi> they departed, taking <hi>Auſpruck</hi> in their way homewards, entered into ſerious, and private conſultations with the Emperor. The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours likewiſe of <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> fearing leaſt in thoſe rumours, their Peſons were not ſafe, privately withdrew from <hi>Trent,</hi> and by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways returned to their own Country. Notwithſtanding which the Ambaſſadours and Divines of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> and two of <hi>Strasbourg</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill in <hi>Trent</hi>; where not having been able to procure Licenſe for their Confeſſion to be received and read in Council, they printed ſeveral Copies of them, and cauſed them to be diſperſed in all places, which gave publick offence to the whole Council; nor could the Intereſt of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Ambaſſadours prevail farther, for the Papal Party ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that all thoſe inſtances made by the Emperour in behalf of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, tended to no other end than to depreſs the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> embraced all occaſions of excuſes, and delays: for now the Emperor's intereſt was grown weak at <hi>Trent</hi> by the retirement of the <hi>German</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who upon the Alarm of Wars in their Country were retired to their own homes: indeed the report of Wars raiſed by the <hi>French</hi> King in confederacy with the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> againſt the Emperor was confirmed, and Manifeſts, and Proteſts in defence of Religion and the liberty of <hi>Germany</hi> were printed and publiſhed; and in purſuance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of on the firſt of <hi>April</hi> the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> laid ſiege to <hi>Augsbourg</hi>;<note place="margin">1552.</note> the which combuſtions had ſo great influence on the Affairs of <hi>Trent,</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:50681:279"/>
that the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops departed, as did alſo the Proteſtants; and a ſmall number of Prelats remaining, and the Legat greatly indiſpoſed in his health, the Council broke up, being prorogued for the ſpace of two years, during which time it was hoped, and expected that the preſent ſtorms would be blown over, and Men return to a more mild, and calm tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>In this manner the Gown gave way to the Sword, which commonly decides the moſt knotty difficulties, and puts an end to long Diſputes of Councils, and the Schools. For now <hi>Henry</hi> II. King of <hi>France</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving joyned his Arms with <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and other diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> made War on the Emperor; the King was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterately angry for the injury he had received in the matter of <hi>Parma</hi>; the Duke incenſed by reaſon of the ill treatment of his Father-in-law <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Lantgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> whom the Emperor ſuffered to languiſh in a tedious impriſonment; and all in general being jealous, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Emperor's growing greatneſs, (whatſoever there might be of Religion pretended in the caſe) united their Arms upon different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. The Duke with a ſtrong Army marched to <hi>Oenipont</hi> in <hi>Rhetia</hi>; and with ſuch expedition that the Emperor was forced to riſe, and retire from thence at midnight to <hi>Villaco</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> on the confines of <hi>Italy</hi>; by which means the Duke became Maſter of <hi>Oenepont,</hi> a place diſtant about three days Journey from <hi>Trent.</hi> But in regard the ſucceſſes of this War were various, and not pertinent to our preſent Treatiſe, we ſhall proceed to matters more nearly relating to the Life, and reign of this Pope <hi>Julius</hi> III.</p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> being diſſolved, and the Pope quiet in <hi>Rome,</hi> he made choice of a certain number of Cardinals in reſemblance of a Council to inſpect the preſent Errors, and abuſes which were crept into the Church, and the diſſolute, and corrupt manners of the Clergy; and to conſider of means to correct, and reform them: but whileſt they attended to theſe matters, they found themſelves ſo engulfed, and immers'd in dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficulties, which were paſt their wiſedom to redreſs, that after ſeveral meetings being unable to conclude any thing, the buſineſs grew cold, and frequent delays, and adjournments from one week to another put an end thereunto without any effect: onely it was agreed that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the Council which at firſt was limited unto two years only, ſhould now be farther enlarged to the term of Ten.</p>
               <p>The Pope who had been in repoſe until now, was alſo diſturbed by the commotion of his Neighbours: for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rtado de Mendoza</hi> who (after having been Ambaſſadour from the Emperor to the Pope) was now conſtituted Governour of <hi>Siena</hi>; to ſecure which from the civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, which then aroſe, and to keep the City in obedience to his Maſter, he began to lay the foundations of a Cittadel; of which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants being apprehenſive, leſt it ſhould ſubject them to a perpetual ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, reſolved ſecretly to reſign themſelves into the protection of <hi>France:</hi> and having ſecretly for that purpoſe diſpatched their Ambaſſadours to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, they received ſuch favourable aſſurance of aid and defence from him, that the People, in a tumultuous manner aroſe in Arms, and being encouraged by the Count <hi>Petigliano</hi> and <hi>Farneſe,</hi> (who maintained the <hi>French</hi> intereſt in that part of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>), they raiſed their Forces with ſuch expedition, that falling on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in a kind
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50681:279"/>
of ſurprize, they cut them to pieces; and having demoliſhed and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the very foundation of the Cittadel, they returned to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient form of Government, ſeeming to outward appearance to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their priſtine Liberty. The news of this revolt of <hi>Siena</hi> was brought to the Emperor, whileſt he was at the ſiege of <hi>Metz</hi> the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal City of <hi>Lorain</hi>; upon receipt of which he inſtantly diſpatched his Orders to <hi>Don Pedro de Toledo</hi> Vice-King of <hi>Naples,</hi> that he ſhould in Perſon attend this War and endeavour the recovery of <hi>Siena. Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro</hi> having received theſe Orders in the depth of the Winter, which was the beginning of the year 1553.<note place="margin">1553.</note> began his march with a formidable Army of twenty thouſand Men compoſed of <hi>Italians, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi> The Pope remembring the times of <hi>Clement</hi> VII. when a <hi>Napolitan</hi> Army ſacked <hi>Rome</hi>; and fearing to be ſurprized with the like calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, levied ſpeedily eight thouſand Men; the conduct of which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Camillo Orſino.</hi> So that now all Chriſtendom being in Arms, the Pope ſent his Legats to the Emperor, and the <hi>French</hi> King to pacify, and mediate their differences in order to a general Peace; but ſo far were the ſpirits of theſe Princes exaſperated againſt each other, that no gentle remedies were available, or any other tryal, but ſuch as ſhould be determined by the judgment of the Sword: and now no prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being made but for War, the Pope conſtituted <hi>Guido <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldo</hi> Duke of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> General of all the Forces of the Church; whileſt Cardinal <hi>da Eſte,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Termes</hi> an excellent Soldier defended <hi>Siena</hi> with a ſtrong Gariſon in the name of the <hi>French</hi> King, The <hi>Imperial</hi> Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their march took <hi>Montechio,</hi> add beſieged <hi>Montalcino,</hi> a Fortreſs belonging to <hi>Siena,</hi> where happened many Skirmiſhes, and Rencounters, with great ſlaughter on both ſides: and Wars being begun in <hi>Siena, Montalcino, Orbitello Groſſetto, Chiuſi</hi> and many other places, all <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany</hi> was in Arms, Fire, Sword, Rapine, and Violence raging in every part thereof: but amidſt of theſe Combuſtions <hi>Don Pedro</hi> dying after a tedious ſickneſs at <hi>Florence,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> gained the advantage; and the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> having placed ſtrong Gariſons in the Fortreſſes which they had taken returned again with their Troops to <hi>Naples.</hi> And this was the iſſue of the firſt years War.</p>
               <p>But then the ſecond was more fatal to <hi>Siena,</hi> proving the final overthrow of the Liberty, and Government of that Republick. For <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> on whoſe protection <hi>Siena</hi> depended, being incenſed againſt <hi>Coſmo de Medicis</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> for favouring the Emperor's Party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the People of <hi>Siena,</hi> did about the beginning of the year 1554.<note place="margin">

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50681:280"/>
thoſe of the Nobility diſdaining to become Subjects to the Duke of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> retired to <hi>Montalcino,</hi> a place ſtrong, and impregnable by nature, ſetting themſelves in the form of a Republick under the protection of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The People of <hi>Siena</hi> lamenting their unhappy fate, accuſed Pope <hi>Julius</hi> in a great meaſure to be the Author of it; for that he had by his Money bought up great ſtores of Proviſion, Victuals, and Ammunition in <hi>Marca, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria,</hi> and <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and therewith relieved, and ſupported the Army of <hi>Florence:</hi> and that not conſidering the publick intereſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> nor the common juſtice of mankind, he, for gaining a poor, and inconſiderable Title of Marquis of Mount <hi>Sabino,</hi> with a little Land to his Brother <hi>Baldwin,</hi> and on the promiſe of obtaining the Daughter of Duke <hi>Coſmo</hi> for Wife to his Brother's Son, had baſely, and ungratefully betrayed the City where he was born, and expoſed it to utter ruin and deſolation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But all this obloquy, and defamation little, moved the mind of the Pope, who perceiving that all his ſollicitude, and care for the general Peace and quiet of Chriſtendom availed little, reſolved to enjoy, and give himſelf up to Buildings, and other divertiſements: ſo that placing all his thoughts on a Country-houſe, Gardens, and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards which he had erected, and made without the <hi>Porta del popolo</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was ſo enamoured of his new Paradiſe, where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually made Feaſts and Banquets, that he ſeemed wholly to have caſt off all care of the Church, and ſenſe of the miſeries of Chriſtendom; and what was moſt undecent, and misbecoming a Perſon of above ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty years of age and of his gravity, and function, he immerſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in pleaſures as if there had been no other Life, to the great ſcandal of the World, and damage and greater danger of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this year 1554. <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth King of <hi>England</hi> died, and the Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſucceeding, immediately ſent her Ambaſſadours to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſignifie to the Pope the converſion of her whole Kingdom from He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie to the Catholick Church, and to acknowledg, and Vow all Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Papal Sea, deſiring to have the Excommunication taken off, and a general Pardon, and Abſolution given to her Catholick Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: on which grateful Meſſage the Ambaſſadours coming, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved with great kindneſs, and ſolemn Proceſſions of Thankſgiving ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, at which the Pope aſſiſted in Perſon. The ſame year <hi>Philip</hi> Son of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth was married to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Kingdoms of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> being ſetled upon him, together with <hi>Milan, Flanders</hi> and ſome other of the United Provinces: with which news <hi>Philip</hi> diſpatched his Ambaſſadour the Marquis <hi>de Peſcara</hi> to the Pope, to acquaint him therewith, and according to the cuſtom of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Kings to do homage for the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which he held in Fee from the Pope.</p>
               <p>And now Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Third being by reaſon of his great age, and the torment of the Gout, which miſerably afflicted him, become very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, was perſuaded by the Phyſitians to change his Diet, and his uſual regimen of living; the which ill agreeing with his habit of Body, brought him to a Fever, with which taking his Bed in the month of <hi>February</hi> 1555.<note place="margin">1555.</note> he lingred therewith until the 23d. of <hi>March,</hi> and then died at his Palace, being aged ſeventy ſeven years, ſix months, and fourteen days: he was afterwards carried without any great Pomp or State to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50681:280"/>
the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> where his Corps having been publickly expoſed for three days to the view of the People, he was afterwards buried in an ordinary Sepulcre of Bricks near the Altar of S. <hi>Andrew.</hi> After which the Sea was vacant ſeventeen days.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Julius</hi> was tall of Stature, of a plain Country Viſage, his Noſe great; his Eyes ſhewed him to be Cholerick, and haſty, but ſoon pleaſed; his Diet was groſs, and plain, being much pleaſed with a ſort of large Onions, which were ſent him from <hi>Gaeta,</hi> the alteration of which Diet haſtned his Death: When he was firſt Pope he ſo ſtrangely favoured a young Boy, whom he called <hi>Innocentius,</hi> that without any apparent motive for it, he beſtowed upon him a Cardinals Hat; which when the reaſon was asked; He replied, What reaſon had you to chooſe me Pope? Fortune favours whom ſhe pleaſes. He was very facetious in his Diſcourſe, but more familiar, in his Converſation than was decent; for without reſpect to the Majeſty of his Office, and gravity of his Function; He would often ſhoot ſuch Bolts, and uſe ſuch Expreſſions, as were unſeemly, and which thoſe that heard, pitied, and bluſhed for him.</p>

His Father was <hi>Robert,</hi> or as ſome call him <hi>Richard,</hi> Treaſurer of the Marquiſat of <hi>Ancona,</hi> and the place of his birth was <hi>Montfano</hi>: his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretended to great Skill, or knowledg in Aſtrology, by which Art calculating the Nativity of his Son at the time of his birth, it appeared that the Stars under which he was born, would be very propitious to him in his promotion to Eccleſiaſtical preferments; for which reaſon <hi>Marcellus</hi> being firſt ſent to have his Education in the Univerſity of <hi>Siena</hi>; he came from thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he dwelt with <hi>Felix</hi> the Datary of <hi>Clement</hi> the 7th. afterwards he obtained the Office of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to <hi>Paul</hi> the Third, and by him created Cardinal of St. <hi>Croſs</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and laſtly, as we have ſaid, elected Pope on the 9th. of <hi>April.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The day following he was conſecrated Biſhop by the Cardinal of <hi>Naples</hi>; and the very ſame day without much Pomp or Solemnity was Crowned with the Pontifical Miter by the Cardinal of <hi>Piſa</hi> who was Arch-Deacon.

coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> in hopes of benefit and preferment by his greatneſs: howſoever his intentions were good and his Deſigns great, having drawn a Scheme, and method whereby to reſtore Peace, and Unity in the Church, and the Papal Power to its antient luſtre.</p>
               <p>This Deſign of his, he communicated to the Cardinal of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> maintaining that there was no other way to reconcile differences in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but onely by a General Council; and that the reaſon, why hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, that means had been ineffectual, was no other, than becauſe, they began at the wrong end, and proceeded not with the due method: for that firſt they ſhould begin with an entire reformation of Manners, which would ſuperſede, and quiet all ſuperficial Debates, and diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about words, and reduce Controverſies to ſuch a ſubſtantial iſſue as would be eaſily determinable by a Council. That for want hereof his five immediate Predeceſſors had much erred, for that they abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the name of <hi>Reformation,</hi> not out of a diſlike to that deſirable State, but from a belief, that it would be a means to abate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Papal Authority, whereas on the contrary he was really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that a Reformation was the onely means to render it more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and powerful, as moſt plainly appeared, and was proved by the Hiſtories of paſt-times, in which thoſe Popes onely were famous, and renowned, who had ſupported their Papal Chair by an exactneſs in Manners, and purity of Life: that Reformation reſpected the entrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and circumſtantial appendages of Religion, and ſerved onely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench the luxury, and ſuperfluous pomp of the Clergy, which made the Prelats envied, and contemptible; when as a modeſt train, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent comportment adjoyned to a ſeverity, and mortified way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, rendered the Prelats awful, and revered; and ſuch Men encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the Papal Chair made it appear more holy, and Apoſtolical; and above all ſo fortified it with the Divine Protection, that nothing would be able to remove, or ſhake the firmneſs of that Throne, which was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on ſo ſure a foundation.</p>
               <p>Theſe Deſigns being publiſhed, and diſcourſed of in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> were received with different Sentiments: ſuch as were of the Pope's Party applauded the intention, as pious, glorious, and ſuch as favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Peace, Charity, and zeal to Religion: but thoſe who were of a contrary Faction made an other interpretation, conſtruing all the actions of this Pope to be regulated by Aſtrological Schemes, to which he gave much credence, in regard that both his Father, and himſelf had been much advanced by that Art. Moreover, amongſt other things projected by this Pope; he intended to have erected a new Order of Chivalry, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a hundred Knights, of which the Pope was to be the Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; all which were to enter into an Oath of Allegiance, and fidelity to the Pope, never to deſert his Cauſe, or Perſon, but always to advance his Power, and Intereſt: and for maintenance of this Degree five hundred Crowns of yearly Penſion were to be iſſued out of the Apoſtolical Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to every Perſon of them: the which allowance was never to be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, or enlarged, nor could other Revenues be bequeathed or purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for an additional maintenance; only they were capable by their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and merits of being created Cardinals without any impeachment of their Vow, or rules of their Order. Out of theſe he intended to chuſe his Nuntios, and Miniſters for all Treaties, and Negotiations, his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50681:281"/>
of Towns, and Legats, and in ſhort to extract all his Officers out of this Society: and ſo far was this Project reſolved that ſeveral wiſe Men, and Perſons of merit, living at <hi>Rome</hi> were already nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who were to be liſted and admitted into this Order.</p>
               <p>Thus did the Pope with ſubtle reaſonings and refined Diſcourſes draw his Methods, and Schemes of Politicks, which would have proved more rude, and prickly in the handling. But whileſt the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with talk, and Novelty, unexpectedly and on a ſudden, the thred of all theſe Deſigns were cut off by the death of the Pope, who having, as is ſaid, wearied, and tired himſelf with the many ſuperfluous and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ceremonies, which he ſuſtained in the Holy Week before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and at his Inaugurations, fell into a fit of an Apoplexy, and died the laſt day of that month of <hi>April</hi> in which he was created, having been Pope no longer than twenty one days; which was a far ſhorter time than what the predictions he had made by his Art in Aſtrology had flattered his belief.</p>

He was made Biſhop of <hi>Tuſculum, Oſtia,</hi> and <hi>Velitres:</hi> and laſtly, being elected Pope in remembrance of his late Friend, and chief Benefactor, who had called him to all his promotions, he cauſed himſelf to be named <hi>Paul</hi> IV.</p>
               <p>In all the courſe of his former Life, being of a moroſe, and Saturnine temper, he ſhewed great ſeverity, and exactneſs of Life; ſo that his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection ſtrook a great fear, and terrour to all ſuch who were ill inclined to a Reformation, imagining that his humour would tranſport him to ſuch ſevere proceedings, as would be terrible and inconſiſtent with thoſe methods, which gently lead Men to converſion and reformation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: a teſtimony of which he had given by being the firſt Author and Contriver of the Inquiſition, having adviſed, and perſuaded <hi>Paul</hi> III. to appoint, and authorize a certain number of Cardinals to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors of ſuch, who had embraced the new Doctrines of <hi>Luther,</hi> and to proceed to Capital Puniſhments in ſuch manner as is provided in the Canon <hi>de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An inſtance of which, he gave to the Steward of his Houſe, when he demanded of him, in what manner he was pleaſed to be ſerved; his Anſwer was ſhort, ſaying (as became a Prince.) His Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation he ordered with more Pomp and Ceremony, than was ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore practiſed; and in all things he affected Magnificence, and State, and was no leſs indulgent to his Nephews, than the moſt tender, and fondeſt of the Popes.</p>
               <p>Soon after his Coronation, he ordered the firſt Conſiſtory to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that he might with the greater State, and Pomp give Audience to the Ambaſſadours of <hi>England,</hi> who in the time of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> had been diſpatched thence from Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> her Husband. The Ambaſſadours being introduced to his preſence, and proſtrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at his feet, did one after the other (for ſo the Pope would have it)
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50681:282"/>
confeſs and acknowledg the faults, and errors of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> in having ſtrayed, and deviated from the flock of Chriſt, and the Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold of the Church; but now repenting, and returning again, did hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg Abſolution and to be received into the boſom of the Church, though by the obſtinacy and perſeverance in their Errors, they had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves unworthy of ſuch mercy, and indulgence. The Pope ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for ſome time beheld theſe Ambaſſadours at his feet, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated their humble poſture with ſome ſatisfaction of ſpirit, raiſed them at length from the floor and embraced them with the tenderneſs of a Father, teſtifying great ſatisfaction in the happy converſion of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and becauſe the Queen and King were the happy Inſtruments of this bleſſed, and religious work; in reward of ſo much Piety, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their right and title to <hi>Ireland</hi>; and by virtue of that Power, which he had received from God to diſpoſe of all Earthly Crowns, he conferred on them that Kingdom, dignifying them amongſt their other Titles with that of King and Queen of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Which piece of vanity though ridiculous to others, was extreamly pleaſing to the Pope, who fancied himſelf in that Throne of Fools Paradiſe, to which the Devil had in his Pride exalted himſelf, when he tempted our Saviour with all the Kingdoms of the Earth. But then afterwards in private Conference with the Ambaſſadours, he blamed <hi>England</hi> for having but in part ſhewed their penitence, for that whilſt they retained any thing of the goods of the Church and did not make reſtitution to the utmoſt farthing, a Curſe would remain on the Kingdom, and the people remain in a perpetual ſnare, and danger of Damnation. He farther told them, That the ſooner, and the more readily they paid the Peter-pence (for collection of which he had ſent an Officer into <hi>England</hi>) the more eaſily would the Gates of Heaven be opened to them; for how could they expect that St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould turn his Keys whileſt they denied him thoſe Fees which were the dues of his Office. In fine, the Ambaſſadours having behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with humility, (which was the onely means to procure the favour of this Pope) they departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> laden with Praiſes, Honours, and Graces from his Holineſs: and then attending to a full Reformation in <hi>England</hi>; he purged the Univerſities of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Cambridg</hi> of thoſe Tenents, and Lectures which had been there taught by <hi>Peter Martir,</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> and deprived <hi>Cranmer</hi> of his Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus obtained his pleaſure, and Deſigns over <hi>England,</hi> he next endeavoured to gain an Aſcendant over the Emperor and King of <hi>France,</hi> both of which courted him to that Degree, that he expected to have them both at his Service, and Devotion: but in regard it was impoſſible to entertain them both in the ſame equality of reſpect, and dearneſs; both Parties ſtrained to outvy each other in Propoſals of advantage, which might give them admiſſion to his favour: in purſuance of which, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> (who was well acquainted with the humour of the Pope) publickly declared in a full Conſiſtory, that beſides the many ſteps which the King of <hi>France</hi> had made in Obedience to the Papal Chair, he did acknowledg that the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church had need of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; towards which he was ready to afford all the aid and aſſiſtance to the Pope that he was able, and to act therein by ſuch ways, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods as his Holineſs ſhould direct, whether it were by ſending his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats to the Council or by any other means, that ſhould be eſteemed more
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50681:283"/>
proper and expedient. The which ſo took with the Pope, that <hi>France</hi> for that time gained a preeminence in his favour.</p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding this Pride, and rudeneſs in his nature, he did ſeveral things at the beginning to gratify and pleaſe the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he performed by abating the Taxes and Impoſts laid on Proviſions, and in other things acted with ſuch obliging circumſtances, that the People in acknowledgment for ſuch abundant favours, erected a Statue of Marble for him in the Capitol. He regulated the Manners of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and retrenched that liberty, and freedom they uſed; and for the better diſtinction of them, ordered them to wear yellow Hats. He publiſhed ſeveral ſevere Decrees againſt ſuch as denied the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, and that he died for the redemption of Mankind. In ſhort, beſides many good Laws and Acts which he ordained againſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and diſſolute Manners, which were grievous to the Clergy, who were unaccuſtomed to a Severity, He ſelected a hundred Citizens of the Gentry of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he created Knights of the <hi>Faith</hi> to be a ſtanding Life-Guard to the Popes. He repealed ſeveral Decrees of <hi>Julius</hi> III. and impriſoned many of thoſe who had been his Creatures, and familiar Friends.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Counſellours, and Familiar Confidents which he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, there was none who had at firſt had a greater ſhare in his favour, than <hi>Oſio,</hi> whom he declared Datary, and chief Notary, or Regiſter of Petitions, and created Biſhop of <hi>Riete</hi>: but he being of a rude, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe temper did always claſh againſt the humour of the Pope, which was hard, and inflexible like his; which therefore ill according together, <hi>Oſio</hi> was by the inſtigation alſo of the Pope's Relations, who were always buſie at his ear, deprived of his favour, and ſent Priſoner to the Caſtle, where he remained for the ſpace of four years.</p>
               <p>In the next place, by a new Decree, he retrieved all thoſe goods, and Eccleſiaſtical Revenues which had been alienated from the Church ſince the time of <hi>Julius</hi> II. to his days. He reformed alſo the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes which were crept into the Office of the Penitentiaries, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Habit, and Tables of the Clergy, and refuſed to admit any into Benefices, but ſuch as had been approved for holineſs of Life, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Manners. Towards the three Conſervators of <hi>Rome,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf with great reſpect, enlarging their Power, and Authority, adjoyning thereunto the juriſdiction of <hi>Tivoli,</hi> which belonged to the Cardinal of <hi>Ferrara</hi>; and to the People he enlarged their Priviledges, and confirmed all their former Immunities by a new Charter.</p>
               <p>But all this indulgence, and kindneſs towards the Citizens was but in order to ſome Deſign of a higher nature, which ſoon after diſcovered it ſelf: for whileſt he was thus buſied in matters of Government, and things laudable enough in themſelves, he ſuffered ſome reports of a Plot againſt his Life to take impreſſion in his mind; which being ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by many probable circumſtances, he immediately ſeized on the Perſons of as many as were ſuſpected to be guilty thereof, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to Priſon; and then joyning with the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Switzers,</hi> he commenced a War againſt <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> by which thoſe antient Feuds and Animoſities between thoſe Kings, which had for ſome time been extinguiſhed, or as it were raked up in the Embers began again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, and be enflamed. The original, and cauſe whereof was this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:50681:283"/>Ever ſince the time that <hi>Rome</hi> had been ſacked by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had plundered, and ſequeſtred the Eſtate, and Rents of the Family of <hi>Caraffa</hi>; this Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 4th. conceived an implacable anger, and an inveterate hatred againſt that whole Nation: the which alſo was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by that ill treatment, and injuſtice, which the Vice-King of <hi>Naples</hi> once uſed towards his own Perſon; for he being created by <hi>Paul</hi> III. Arch biſhop of <hi>Naples,</hi> was debarred from the poſſeſſion, and benefits thereof by the Vice-King, on no other pretence, than that he was ſuſpected to favour the <hi>French</hi> Party; the which ſo enraged his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous ſpirit, that with all the arguments, which ſubtilty, and malice could draw from the Topicks of Religion, and publick good to the Church, he endeavoured to perſuade <hi>Paul</hi> III, to a War againſt <hi>Naples,</hi> promiſing him to aſſiſt him with the whole Eſtate of his Family, and with all the intereſt he had (which he pretended to be very great) in that Kingdom: but <hi>Paul</hi> III. being too prudent to give ear to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, and Diſcourſes, commended his Piety, and zeal towards the Church, but refuſed to engage himſelf in that hazardous War. So that the anger and fury of this <hi>Paul</hi> IV. being ſuppreſſed until he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Pope, did then burſt forth, and vent it ſelf: ſo that then with thoughts full of diſdain againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and with imagination that the <hi>Napolitans</hi> would gladly ſhake off their yoke, and be eaſed of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Servitude, and that <hi>France</hi> would enter into the Alliance with him, he poſitively reſolved on a War, ſwallowing already into his thoughts the enjoyment and addition of that Rich Kingdom to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the Church. This Deſign was promoted by a ſtricter Union with <hi>France,</hi> occaſioned in this manner: <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from <hi>Charles Sforza</hi> Prior of <hi>Lombardy</hi> two Gallies, the which coming afterwards into the Port of <hi>Civita Vecchia, Alexander</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Charles,</hi> and Chief Clark of the <hi>Camera,</hi> or Chamberlain, made ſeizure of them, and without any reſpect to that Protection under which they were within the Pope's Harbour, he carried them away by force to <hi>Gaeta:</hi> of which the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters at <hi>Rome,</hi> complaining to the Pope, he conceived not onely anger and indignation againſt <hi>Alexander,</hi> but ſuſpecting that ſuch an action could not be contrived without the privity of his Brother the Cardinal, he loudly exclaimed againſt him, and clapt his Secretary <hi>Lotini</hi> into Priſon, who was lately returned with ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Negotiations from the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. the which ſerving to encreaſe and heighten the differences between them, many Cabals, and Conſults were formed amongſt the Cardinals of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Faction; at which the Pope being alarm'd he reinforced his Guards, and levied Soldiers, and to break the ſeditious Meetings clapt the Cardinal, and <hi>Camilla Colonna,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Briſegna,</hi> who was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> into Priſon: <hi>Mark Anthony Colonna,</hi> who upon theſe ſtories, was fled from <hi>Rome,</hi> was cited to appear there, and give anſwer to the Accuſations charged againſt him: but afterwards the Gallies being again reſtored to the <hi>French</hi> King, Cardinal <hi>Sforza,</hi> and <hi>Camillo Colonna,</hi> upon Bail given were freed from Impriſonment; but <hi>Alexander Sforza</hi> who was Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain not appearing upon the Summons, was deprived of his Office; and becauſe <hi>Mark Anthony Colonna</hi> did not appear at the time prefixed by the Summons, all his Eſtate within the Territories of the Church was ſequeſtred, and ſeized to the uſe of the Pope: with which <hi>Joan</hi> of

                  <hi>Aragon</hi> the Mother of <hi>Colonna</hi> being greatly affrighted, eſcaped ſecretly from <hi>Rome</hi> about the beginning of the year 1556. contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and Injunction of the Pope; with which he was ſo incenſed, that he then reſolved to act, and put all thoſe miſchiefs into practice againſt the Houſe of <hi>Colonna,</hi> which he had before onely meditated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived in his thoughts: and in purſuance thereof, he in the firſt place excommunicated <hi>Mark Anthony,</hi> and his Father <hi>Aſcanio Colonna,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving confiſcated all their Eſtate within the Dominions of the Church, he beſtowed it on his Nephew <hi>John</hi> Count of <hi>Montorio,</hi> whom he created Duke of <hi>Paliano</hi>; and not long after he declared <hi>Anthony Carafa</hi> an other Nephew to be Marquis of <hi>Montebello,</hi> having lately diſpoſſeſſed Count <hi>Bagno</hi> of that Marquiſate for having converted thoſe Moneys which the King of <hi>France</hi> ſent to the Pope for carrying on the War in <hi>Italy</hi> to his own uſe. All which ſerved to incenſe the ſpirits of a great, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Faction, and raiſe thoſe Wars, which ended in miſerable deſolation of <hi>Italy.</hi> But the Pope, who was of Opinion, and often ſaid, that a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Peace was onely to be procured by a calamitous War, did in Order thereunto fortifie <hi>Paliano</hi> with all proviſions requiſite thereunto; for that being a place ſituate on the frontiers of <hi>Naples,</hi> was of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in that conjuncture: And leſt the Truce which was made for five years between the Emperor and <hi>France</hi> ſhould be an obſtruction to this War, he diſpatched <hi>Charles Caraffa</hi> his Legat to <hi>Henry</hi> II. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that his Meſſage was in order to a farther accommodation, and to convert the Truce into an everlaſting Peace: but the Negotiations of <hi>Caraffa</hi> being of an other nature, he poſſeſſed <hi>Henry</hi> with great hopes and expectation of ſucceſs by a War with <hi>Naples</hi>; wherefore though at firſt he ſent but two thouſand Men for aſſiſtance of the Pope, (ſeeming to reſerve ſome little reſpect to the Truce ſo lately concluded) yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Popes forces not being able to withſtand the Power of the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi>; a greater Army of twelve thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe were ſent to <hi>Naples</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi> With theſe Auxiliary aids the ſpirit of the Pope being highly ſwelled, and become implacable, he impriſoned <hi>Juliano Seſarini Camillo Colonna,</hi> with his Bother the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Taranto,</hi> and divers others, whom he ſuſpected to be in any manner affected, and inclinable to the <hi>Imperial</hi> Faction. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> then Vice-King of <hi>Naples,</hi> being alarmed by theſe proceedings reſolved not to attend the aſſaults of the Enemy; but rather, that he might be, beforehand with them, made Incurſions into the State of the Church, and without much reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance took <hi>Pontecorvo Froſolone, Anagna, Marino, Valmontone, Paleſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Tivoli, Oſtia, Gave, Genazzano, Nettuno, Albano, Vicovaro, Monte For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino</hi>; and in ſhort, made himſelf Maſter of all the <hi>Campania</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> the Pope on the other ſide with the aid, and aſſiſtance of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Switzers,</hi> recovered ſeveral of thoſe places again; but the War being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for the ſpace of a whole year with great fury, and reſolution on both ſides, that Country became moſt miſerably haraſſed, and laid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate by fire, and ſword. By the vaſt expences of this War the Pope's Treaſury being much exhauſted, many exorbitant ways were contrived to repleniſh it again; as namely, the Tithes upon all Benefices were doubled, the <hi>Gabelles,</hi> and Cuſtoms were raiſed to an intolerable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; half a years Revenue was exacted from all Offices: and the Debts
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50681:284"/>
which particular Perſons owed to their Creditors, were required to be paid into the Treaſury; upon which the Debtors being diſcharged, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentures were given from the Pope to the Creditors, and the ſame charged as a Debt upon the Church. He farther ſeized on all the Horſes in <hi>Rome</hi> to ſerve in the War, and compelled all the Friers of what order ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to labour on the Works, and carry Earth to the Fortifications: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Churches he converted into Granaries and Store-houſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to lay Proviſions; beſides many other Exactions, and agrievances, which he impoſed on the People, who were by this time poſſeſſed with a deteſtable hatred againſt his Perſon, and his Actions. Howſoever, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Cries, nor Exclamations of his Subjects, nor the miſeries of his Country were able to incline the fierce and reſolute Spirit of the Pope to any terms of Peace, whilſt he found himſelf ſeconded by the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Switzers:</hi> Howſoever in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, the <hi>French</hi> having received a Defeat at the Battel of St. <hi>Quintin,</hi> in which a great part of the Nobility of <hi>France</hi> were taken Priſoners; and thereby alſo the expectation of the Pope being in ſome meaſure defeated; his haughty Spirit began to abate and hearken to ſome terms, and propoſals of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation: for then the ſad Spectacle of <hi>Italy,</hi> laid waſt with fire and ſword appeared before him, and the dreadful apprehenſion of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt his Perſon, which was plotted to betray <hi>Rome</hi> into the hands of <hi>Mark Anthony Colonna,</hi> and <hi>Aſcanio della Corona,</hi> who at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the War revolted to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Party, did much affright him: ſo that as I ſay, the Pope's mind being become more flexible, a Peace was concluded on the thirteenth of <hi>September</hi> 1557.<note place="margin">1557.</note> by the mediation of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Sforza,</hi> and ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> in behalf of the Pope, and by the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> in the name of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain.</hi> Which being concluded the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> with Chriſtian humility kiſſed the feet of the Pope, and received abſolution; and being treated with high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour obtained the freedom of all thoſe who had been impriſoned on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the late War.</p>
               <p>Matters being by theſe means reduced to ſome tolerable quiet, the Pope diſpatched his Legats both to <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> to labour a cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Peace, which he himſelf of late had been an Inſtrument to break; recommending more particularly in their Inſtructions the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Dukedom of <hi>Paliano</hi> on his Nephew. So that now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearied with War, the fatigues, and expence, and unquietudes of which he had never before been acquainted with, the Pope betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his more agreeable trade of regulating the Manners of Men, and the corruptions and abuſes crept into the Church: but in regard the particulars hereof were various, and burthenſom, he committed the greateſt part of that trouble to the Conduct of Cardinal <hi>Caraffa:</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending himſelf with ſedulity and attention to the Court of Inquiſition, as the ſole Tribunal then capable to ſuppreſs Hereſies, and the preſent diſtempers of the Age; and therefore to the cogniſance of that Court he reduced ſeveral Crimes triable at other Bars of Judicature; ſo that the Priſons of the Inquiſition were filled with Malefactors: and in this way of Judicial proceedings he was the more paſſionate, becauſe he had been the firſt that perſuaded <hi>Paul</hi> III. to erect that Court, and had contrived the Methods, and Rules for the proceedings thereof: and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50681:285"/>
therefore coming now himſelf to the Popedom, he put all thoſe Orders into practice, which he had formerly meditated, conſtituting Cardinal <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſandrino</hi> Inquiſitor General, together with ſixteen Cardinals, who were made Judges of the Court; whoſe firſt work was to publiſh an Index <hi>Expurgatorius</hi> of all Books in the leaſt manner ſuſpected, or attainted of Hereſie, forbidding all Perſons under pain of Excommunication to read them, or have them in their poſſeſſion. He recalled Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi> from his Office of Legat in <hi>England,</hi> on account (as ſome believe) of an old Pique that had been between them, and having accuſed Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> of Hereſie, by reaſon as ſome believe of his friendſhip to <hi>Poole,</hi> he impriſoned him in the Caſtle together with the Biſhop of <hi>Cava,</hi> and had (as was certainly believed) deprived them of all their Revenue, and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, had not his malice againſt them been interrupted by his Death, acting in every thing with a bitterneſs agreeable to the virulency of his nature.</p>
               <p>About this time the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V. being wearied with the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moils, and troubles of this World renounced his Imperial Crown to his Brother <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who was already elected King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and his Kingdom of <hi>Spain</hi> and other Dominions to his Son <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> II. But this Abdication the Pope would not underſtand, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting on the ſcore of old grudges which he owed to <hi>Charles,</hi> that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to antient Canons an Emperor could make ſuch a renunciation without conſulting firſt, and taking the advice, and conſent of the Pope; and for that reaſon, he would never acknowledg <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, nor under that Notion, and Character receive Ambaſſadours from him.</p>
               <p>In this manner with a froward ſeverity acting all his Affairs, he would admit of no excuſes that any Man made for a failure in his Duty; and particularly having commanded all Monks, Friers, Abbots, and Priors to return to their Monaſteries, he would not admit an Excuſe from any Non-Reſidentiary, unleſs he had obtained a Licenſe on occaſion of ſome publick Service for the Church: and for diſcovery of ſuch Treſpaſſers he employed Officers, or Viſitors as ſevere, as himſelf, who upon ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry having found any Non-Reſidentaries, they immediately proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them as Diſobedient, and Delinquents, committing ſome of them to Chains, and others to the Gallies.</p>
               <p>This Severity howſoever was much applauded, when after an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and unpractiſed manner of Juſtice, he ſpared not the Crimes of his Nephews, into whoſe hands he had committed the moſt important Government of the Eccleſiaſtical State: for they having misbehaved themſelves; the Pope in a publick Conſiſtory diſcharged Cardinal <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raffa</hi> of his Government, and <hi>Legantine</hi> Power in <hi>Bologna:</hi> the Duke of <hi>Palvano</hi> he diſmiſſed from being General of the Eccleſiaſtical Army and Admiral of the Gallies belonging to the Church, and the Marquis of <hi>Montebello</hi> from being Captain of his Guards: which Sentence againſt them the Pope thundring with impetuous Rage, certain Cardinals would have offered ſomething to mitigate his fury, and extenuate the faults of his Nephews; but thoſe Lenitives adding more flame to his Fury, he inſtantly charged the Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> without farther delay to depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> and remain confined to the City <hi>Indivina,</hi> and the other two unto their reſpective Caſtles: in places of theſe, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50681:285"/>
other grave Prelats, whom he eſteemed able, and worthy to bear that ſhare of Government, which by reaſon of the infirmity of his old age he was uncapable to ſupport.</p>
               <p>And having thus diſpoſed the Affairs of his Temporal Government, he returned his thoughts to perfect that Reformation, which he had then projected when he firſt came to the Papal Chair, believing that the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment thereof would be the greateſt Ornament of the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sea, and give it a reputation over all the World. In purſuance whereof, he erected a Congregation compoſed of twenty four Cardinals and forty five Prelats, and other Perſons of the moſt wiſe, and learned of all the Court, to the number of one hundred and fifty. Theſe he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three Claſſes or Chambers; to each of which he allotted eight Cardinals, and fifteen Biſhops, and as many others, as made up the number of fifty; the chief incumbence and buſineſs of whom was to examine, and enquire into the ſeveral degrees, and natures of Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the which being ſtated, and concluded by this Congregation, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies thereof were taken, and publiſhed and ſent to all Univerſities, and Schools of learned Men, requiring them to take notice of the particular Caſes ſtated, and concluded by the Holy Sea, which was the Chief Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and Cathedratical Caſuiſt in all Points of Religion, and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And though he himſelf, as he affirmed, had no need of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations being well acquainted with the mind of Chriſt, and verſed in the Duty of that Office to which he was called; yet that he might in all his endeavours for Reformation, foreſtall the Objection which might be made him of, Phyſitian, cure thy ſelf; he reſolved to begin at home, and reform the Crimes of Simony, which were objected as the crying ſins of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that when he had gone ſo far, he would then remonſtrate unto other Princes the Simony of their own Courts, which was more rife, and more intolerable in them than was ever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, or practiſed at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when the particular Caſes of Simony came diſtinctly to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; inſtancing in what manner Money might be taken and in what not; there aroſe ſuch diverſities of Opinions; that at length the concluſions came to be laid before the Pope, as the ultimate Moderator of all Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences: the which he having with ſome perplexity conſidered, he finally reſolved, That it was not lawful to receive any Price, Money, Alms, or any reward whatſoever for conferring any ſpiritual Graces, or Benefices Eccleſiaſtical: and that as to the Diſpenſations in caſes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, though it had been the cuſtom to receive Money for them, he reſolved, that the ſame ſhould never be again brought into practice by himſelf. Howſoever, ſo many ſcruples and Objections aroſe in many particular matters, that nothing could ever be drawn to general Heads; and ſo being environed by difficulties which procured delays, nothing came to a full reſolution: the which a certain Cardinal having obſerved, propoſed to have theſe Queſtions reſerved for a General Council: at which the Pope being moved with extreme Choler, replied, That he had no need of any Council being the ſupreme Head and above it; but the Cardinal being deſirous to mollifie, and appeaſe his anger with ſome qualifications of his Speech, ſaid, that though it was true that a Council was not neceſſary for giving force, and Authority to the Pope's Determinations; yet it might be convenient to have a Council, for ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50681:286"/>
of that Uniformity of Worſhip which was neceſſary in all Chriſtian Churches: to which the Pope aſſenting, farther added, That in caſe he ſhould at any time call a Council, that the ſame ſhould be held at <hi>Rome</hi> and not at <hi>Trent,</hi> which was in the midſt, and almoſt the Neſt of the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> Moreover, in caſe he ſhould at any time call a Council, it ſhould be compoſed of none, but Catholicks; for that they might with as much reaſon admit a <hi>Turk</hi> to thoſe Debates, and Conſults of Religion, as a <hi>Lutheran</hi> or any other Heretick: and that it was unreaſonable, and prepoſterous to ſend ſixty able and learned Biſhops and forty Doctors to a Town within the Mountains, (as had been done twice already) on ſuppoſition that they were better able to govern the World than the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, joined to the wiſdom of his College of Cardinals, who were ſelected out of the moſt wiſe, religious, and excellent perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages of the Chiſtian Church.</p>
               <p>During his time this Pope at four ſeveral Ordinations created nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Cardinals; and changed the Feſtival of St. <hi>Peter</hi> which by antient Canons was celebrated on the 18th. of <hi>January</hi> to the end of <hi>June,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that ſeaſon of the year moſt convenient for that Solemnity.</p>
               <p>It is certain that this Pope intended well, and deſigned with the ſtricteſt ſeverity the reformation of Manners; but his way of acting therein was ſo fierce, and with thoſe diſobliging circumſtances, having a motion with his Head which ſpoke anger, and ſpight; that he could perform nothing though never ſo holy, and laudable, but what was ill cenſured by evil Tongues, and indeed he was generally hated, and that even by good Men. And though all the good actions which this Pope performed, were done with ſo ill a meen, as made them appear bad; yet he had the good Conduct, and fortune to prove a ſucceſsful Inſtrument in making that memorable Peace between <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France</hi>; for which happineſs, and Rejoycing, Tilts and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments being appointed at the <hi>French</hi> Court, King <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part in it, was unfortunately ſlain, and his Son <hi>Francis</hi> II. being then a Youth, ſucceeded in his Throne.</p>
               <p>About which time the Pope being fallen into a Dropſie with which finding himſelf to decay, and his end approach; he ſummoned all the Cardinals to his Chamber, deſiring them to caſt their thoughts upon ſome Perſon, excellently qualified both for holineſs of Life, and Wiſdom, whom they might judg worthy to ſucceed him in the Apoſtolical Chair, but in an eſpecial manner he recommended to them the continuance of the Inquiſition, to which he gave the Epithet of moſt Holy, declaring to have by good experience proved, that the ſame had been the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his Authority, and would be the chief Baſis, and Pillar of the Papal Dignity.</p>
               <p>But ſo ſoon as it was noiſed abroad, that the Pope drew towards his end: the People aroſe in a tumult, and without Counſel or Rule run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning through the City curſed the name and actions of <hi>Paul</hi> IV. damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Family and Party of <hi>Caraffa</hi>; and having opened all the doors of the common Priſons, they ran to the Houſe of the Inquiſition, of which having opened the Gates, and releaſed the Priſoners, they ſet fire to the Building, which conſumed the Priſon, and the place of Judicature toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the Proceſſes, Papers, and Records of that Court; and had proceeded to have offered the like to the <hi>Minerva,</hi> where ſeveral of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50681:286"/>
the Judges of the Inquiſition were lodged, but that the Rhetorick, and perſuaſions of ſome who had power with the Rabble diverted their fury.</p>
               <p>In fine, this Pope died the 18th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1559.<note place="margin">1559.</note> being aged eighty three years, one month, and twenty two days, and having governed four years, two months, and twenty ſeven days, and his Body was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with little Pomp, and buried in a Sepulcre of Brick, in the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> after which the Sea was vacant four months, and ſeven days, but no ſooner was the breath out of his Body, than the furious, and mad Rabble ran to the Capitol, where he had a Statue of Marble ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by an excellent Artiſt, and placed amongſt the Conſervators of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Head and right Hand of which they having taken off, drew them for three days together through all the filth, and ordure of the City, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wearied with the ſport, they threw them into the <hi>Tyber:</hi> and, finally by publick Decree of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was commanded, that in what place ſoever of the City the Arms of <hi>Caraffa</hi> were found either painted, or engraven, they ſhould be defaced, or broken; the which was executed with ſo much readineſs, that in one days time, there were no ſignals, or memorials of the <hi>Caraffian</hi> Family remaining in the whole City. By all which it appears, that this <hi>Paul</hi> IV. had been happier, and more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced had he died with the Title onely of Cardinal <hi>Caraffa,</hi> and with the Opinion of being worthy to govern, though he had never reigned.</p>

time of <hi>Clement</hi> VII. he was made one of the Protonotaries which they call <hi>Partecipanti:</hi> under <hi>Paul</hi> III.

               <p>
                  <hi>Du Cheſne,</hi> and others who write of the election of this Pope, report, that the Debates thereupon having been long, and intricate, the Choice came at length to be decided by the Holy Ghoſt, which in the form of a Dove, entering the Chappel of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> after many flights round, came at length to pierch on the Cell, or Seat of Cardinal <hi>Santa Priſca,</hi> which being obſerved was agreed to be the Holy Omen, by which the Holy Ghoſt pointed out the Perſon to be Elected, concluding all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies by a Miracle: but other more judicious Authors are ſilent in ſuch a foppery, and particularly <hi>Onufrius Panvinius,</hi> who writing the life of this Pope, mentions nothing of this nature, though he proſeſſes to have known him, and to have frequented his Table when he was Cardinal, which was always incompaſſed with Men of Learning, and parts, who converſing one with another with much ingenuity and Candour, ſeemed to form a College of wiſe, and virtuous Perſons: and he farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that having been preſent at the ſolemnities of his Election, and Inauguration, he had ſeen, and obſerved all the paſſages of it. He more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over pretends to have had a perſonal acquaintance with him, and that he was in his own nature generous and compaſſionate, having by many, and great Charities he had performed, obtained the Title of <hi>Father of the Poor</hi>; and thus having acquired a general eſteem amongſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals of a meek, gentle, and pious temper, he found a more eaſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the Papal Chair, which had lately been poſſeſſed by gall, and bitterneſs, and from whence nothing but Thunder, and Lightning and terrours had proceeded.</p>
               <p>But this Pope being deſirous to rectifie this harſh humour of the Chair, gave himſelf the name of <hi>Pius</hi> IV. And for inſtances thereof; his firſt care, and incumbence was to paſs an Act or Decree of General Pardon to all ſuch who during the vacancy of the Sea had committed any enormous Crimes, and in common to all the people who had with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent deſpight broken the Statue, and defaced the Arms of <hi>Paul</hi> IV. Then his next buſineſs was to enquire into, and redreſs the Oppreſſions, and agrievances impoſed by his Predeceſſour, referring the examination of thoſe matters to a Committee of wiſe and ſober Men, who rectifying that which was amiſs, all things might at length return to their due and accuſtomed Channel: upon reviſion of which caſes, many Decrees paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Paul</hi> IV. in point of Simony were repealed, or at leaſt modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: many Friers who had with too much ſeverity been expelled their Monaſteries, were reſtored: the puniſhments, and cruelties of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition were regulated with more moderation; and in fine, many of thoſe who under colour of Hereſie, though in reality out of malice, or other deſign had been committed to that Priſon; were by Order of the new Inquiſitors releaſed and ſet at liberty; amongſt which Cardinal <hi>Morone,</hi> was one.</p>
               <p>Now as Mercy is always to be accompanied with Juſtice: it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that thoſe intolerable miſeries, and devaſtations which all <hi>Italy</hi>

almoſt had ſuſtained in time of <hi>Paul</hi> IV. ſhould be conſidered, and the Family of <hi>Caraffa</hi> who had been the Inſtruments, and wicked Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in all thoſe Calamities ſhould be queſtioned, and tried for the ſame: in order whereunto on the 7th. of <hi>January,</hi> being the day after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coronation, the Cardinals <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Alfonſo</hi> coming from the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory were ſeized, as was alſo the Count of <hi>Montorio,</hi> then called Duke of <hi>Paliano,</hi> who was the Brother of <hi>Charles</hi> the Cardinal, together with Count <hi>Alife</hi> his Wife's Brother, and <hi>Leonard de Cardini</hi> one of the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; for theſe having been evil Counſellours, and worſe Inſtruments of the fury and cruelty of the late Pope, were all committed Priſoners to the Caſtle, as were alſo ſeveral other Servants, and Miniſters of the late miſchief. The Proceſs againſt them for theſe Crimes was encharged to certain Cardinals in Commiſſion with the Biſhop of <hi>Savona,</hi> and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Indictments being preferred againſt theſe Perſons, and the Depoſitions ſeverally made and taken, which work took up the ſpace of nine months, in which time the proofs, and teſtimonies being given, and every thing prepared for a Trial, the whole Proceſs was read before the Pope and Cardinals in publick Conſiſtory; where the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations being proved, and made clear by ſeveral credible Witneſſes, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Charles Carafa</hi> was by the Pope himſelf convicted of Felony, and the Count of <hi>Montorio,</hi> with Count <hi>Alife,</hi> and <hi>Leonard de Cardine</hi> found guilty by the Governour of <hi>Rome</hi> of Murther, and other enormous Crimes, and all delivered into the hands of the Civil Judges, that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death might be paſſed upon them; in execution of which the Cardinal, and the two Counts were ſtrangled, and <hi>de Cardine</hi> beheaded. <hi>Onufrius Panvinius</hi> tells us, that he having had a familiar converſation with this Pope had often heard him lament the ſadneſs of this Tragedy, which he was conſtrained to execute in reſpect to the Duty he owed to Juſtice; and for example, and caution to the Nephews, and Relations of ſucceeding Popes, who when they ſoar aloft on the wings of good Fortune may by the fate of others be fore-warned, how they commit the like exceſſes, for which they may be queſtioned, when times ſhould alter.</p>
               <p>Howſoever this Pope himſelf, according to the cuſtom of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors admitted his Siſters Sons to <hi>Rome,</hi> raiſing them to all thoſe Benefits, and Dignities he was able to beſtow upon them; amongſt which he had the fortune to have <hi>Charles Borromeo</hi> to be his Relation, a Perſon of that modeſt, wiſe, and induſtrious temper, as might deſerve that honour, and preferments which he deſigned for him; for being skilful and well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the Civil Law, and in the management of worldly Affairs, he committed the moſt important charge of all matters relating to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to his fidelity, and conduct; of which <hi>Borromeo</hi> ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf, that being created Cardinal, he gained the reputation of a wiſe Miniſter during the time of this <hi>Pius,</hi> and afterwards by the holineſs of his life in ſucceeding times was canonized for a Saint.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Borromeo,</hi> and to Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> he communicated all his thoughts and Counſels, taking their Opinion in the higheſt emergencies and exigencies of State; amongſt which nothing appeared more difficult, and worthy of diſquiſition, than two things, namely the recognizing, or acknowledging <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for Emperor; and reviving again the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> The firſt as we have ſaid, was denied by <hi>Paul</hi> IV. on alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50681:288"/>
that the Conſtitution of an Emperor did eſſentially require the Pope's authoritative approbation; but in truth the obſtruction was in the Electors, who challenged a right of electing the Emperor. But now it was reſolved to wave all that, and to grant the Emperor's deſires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were demanded, that ſo the frankneſs of this Pope's nature might be diſtinguiſhed from the ſeverity of his Predeceſſours. In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance whereunto Letters were wrote to the Emperor adorned with all his Imperial Titles, wherein the Pope approved the Surrender which <hi>Charles</hi> had made of the Empire, and the ſucceſſion of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; the news hereof was received with that ſatisfaction by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, then at <hi>Vienna,</hi> that he immediately diſpatched his Ambaſſadour, the Count <hi>d' Arco,</hi> with Letters to the Pope, congratulating his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that ſupreme Dignity, and rendering him thanks for having out of his wiſdom, and paternal Juſtice freely determined that point in his favour, which <hi>Paul</hi> IV. againſt all ſenſe, and reaſon had denied him. But yet things did not ſo ſmoothly paſs, but that the Ambaſſadour being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Rome,</hi> encountred ſome difficulty before admiſſion to his Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; for he having in his Inſtructions, Orders onely to acknowledg Reverence to the Pope in behalf of his Maſter, the expreſſion ſeemed to ſound low, and to intimate, as if the Emperor intended to infer an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality with the Pope; and therefore to clear that Scruple, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that the word Reverence, ſhould be changed into Obedience. The Ambaſſadour having no ſuch warrant in his Inſtructions abſolutely refuſed to accept his Audience upon thoſe terms, alledging that Imperial Miniſters had never uſed that Stile towards any of his Predeceſſours; in which reſolution alſo he was farther confirmed by the advice of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour: Howſoever the Cardinals <hi>Morone,</hi> and <hi>Madrucio</hi> perſuading him to the contrary, their Opinions prevailed, becauſe the Emperor had in all points of difficulty, directed him to be governed by their Sentiments.</p>
               <p>This difficulty being overcome; It was reſolved, That the Pope ſhould with the ſame free ſpirit declare his intentions ſpeedily to aſſemble a General Council at <hi>Trent,</hi> or rather a continuation of the ſame after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Prorogations; that ſo he might foreſtall the deſires of the Chriſtian Princes, whom he underſtood were ready with their Addreſſes to that purpoſe. But in regard the turbulent commotions about Religion were heightened with that fermentation in all parts of Chriſtendom as would not admit of thoſe ſlow Methods of cure which were to proceed from the Debates and Reſolves of a General Council: it was in the firſt place deſired by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that Authority might be given him by the Pope for a Conference touching certain points of Religion to be held within his Dominions, for better inſtruction of the People, who were ready to fall off, and revolt from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and indeed this expedient ſeemed moſt urgent at this time, in which many, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a total defection from the Church, and finding themſelves perſecuted in <hi>Poland, Germany, Provence, Puglia</hi> and other parts, were fled into the Vallies of <hi>Mont-cenis, Luſerne,</hi> St. <hi>Martin,</hi> and the places adjoyning, where they maintained themſelves in ſeparate Congregations under certain Miniſters, until ſuch time as the Doctrine of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> ſhould be planted, and ſetled in the City of <hi>Geneva.</hi> And whereas the Duke being reſolved to reduce his Country to the profeſſion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50681:288"/>
Religion, had by the Authority of the Inquiſition eſtabliſhed, condemned ſome to the Gallies, and others to the Fire: yet finding that theſe ſeverities operated little upon minds already prepoſſeſſed with an Opinion of Religion, and Conſcience, he was deſirous to make trial of the more gentle, and ſoft means of Inſtructions, leſt his People becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſperate under their hardſhip and torments ſhould be perſuaded to believe it lawful to take up Arms in defence of their Perſons, and their Religion.</p>
               <p>The Pope ill reliſhed this Propoſal, declaring that he would never conſent to have his Authority put to compromiſe, or his Power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for: that he was well acquainted with what obſtinacy the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks maintained their Doctrines, which were never to be confuted but by the Sword; the which he eſteemed to be the moſt effectual way of Inſtruction; and having perſuaded the Duke to that remedy; a War was begun in the Valleys which continued for a long time.</p>
               <p>Nor were the diſturbances in <hi>France</hi> leſs grievous than in <hi>Savoy:</hi> where many were put to death for no other cauſe than for their zeal to the true reformed Religion, and the ſalvation of their own Souls: though it is true, that many, who were ambitious, and deſirous of Novelty did under this guiſe, and cloak of Religion, and with pretence of reſcuing the King, and the Dignity of the Sovereign Magiſtrate from the uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and tyranny of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and his Party, take up Arms, and enter into Rebellion againſt their King; but being afterwards beaten and many killed, others were afterwards tried, and for their Offences juſtly condemned to die: and to all others, who being miſguided by Religion ſhould lay down their Arms in the ſpace of twenty four hours, Proclamation was made, that they ſhould be received to mercy by a full and plenary Pardon from his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>But now the humours of the People being moved, and hopes concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of obtaining liberty of Conſcience: great tumults were raiſed in <hi>Provence, Languedoc, Poitou,</hi> and other places; ſo that how to ſuppreſs theſe tumults and quiet the minds of the people, which were feavered with the heats of Religion, was the great matter debated in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>France:</hi> and whereas it was objected by the Cardinal <hi>Armagnac,</hi> that no Eccleſiaſtical remedy could be applyed without the aſſent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Pope; this ſcruple was ſoon exploded by the contrary Opinion of the moſt of the Council: who alledged, that God had given to every Nation a full Power, and Authority within it ſelf to provide remedies neceſſary, and agreeable to the preſent government of their State, without having recourſe to forein and far diſtant Powers: for as it were unreaſonable in caſe of fire, and terrible incendiations within the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> to expect till waters were brought from the <hi>Tybur</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the flames: and in the mean time neglect the uſe of the more near and convenient ſtreams of the <hi>Seine,</hi> and <hi>Mearne:</hi> ſo alſo would it be in this great conflagration of civil-War to neglect remedies at home, until we can fetch them from remote, and diſtant Countries. In ſhort therefore it was agreed that a National Council ſhould be aſſembled, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of all the Prelats of the Kingdom, whoſe buſineſs it ſhould be to conſult, and find out means to give a ſtop to the growing evils, and to the courſe of thoſe infections which were ready to poiſon, and overwhelm the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:50681:289"/>Howſoever, leſt this Edict for ſummoning a National Council ſhould be ill taken by the Pope, and interpreted for a point of diſreſpect to the Apoſtolical Sea, without his conſent thereunto, or at leaſt an intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given thereof: it was ordered that the Ambaſſadour reſiding at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould by word of mouth repreſent the many dangers, and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evils within the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> which could be cured by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy than a National Aſſembly, and that the dangers thereof were ſo preſſing, as not to admit the ſlow Methods of forein Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Theſe matters being exactly in this manner repreſented to the Pope, were very ill reſented by him, judging that ſuch an Aſſembly of Prelats could not be convened without a breach of the Eccleſiaſtical Canons, nor without prejudice to the Papal Authority: which to make more clearly appear he reſolved to diſpatch the Biſhop of <hi>Viterbo</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> to make known unto his Majeſty; That ſuch an Aſſembly was never admitted by former Popes in any Country or Kingdom whatſoever; they being well aſſured, that ſuch a meeting would ſerve to no other end, than to adminiſter unto greater diviſion, and confuſion, and produce a Schiſm in the Church Catholick: and, That it would ſerve farther to exalt the pride of the Prelats, inſpiring them with an Opinion of ſome ſuperiour Authority inherent in them, above that of the Pope, or of the King; but if he would apply a true, and an effectual remedy, none could be ſo ſucceſsful as a General Council, which he had reſolved ſhortly to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble; and that in the mean time nothing could be ſo available, as that the Biſhops be commanded to repair to their reſpective Dioceſes, and the Curats to their Pariſhes, and there to watch over their Flocks, and hinder Thieves, and Wolves from breaking within the Fold: and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, deſired that their Spiritual Authority might be reinforced by the Power of the Civil Magiſtrate, and the Arms of Regal force.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Viterbo</hi> being with theſe Inſtructions diſpeeded into <hi>France</hi>; he was farther commanded in his Journey thither to negotiate matters in the ſame form at the Court of <hi>Savoy</hi>; and to incite the Duke to make War upon <hi>Geneva,</hi> which they called the Neſt of Hereſie, and the root from whence ſprang all the falſe Doctrines of the new Religion: the Biſhop accordingly did not fail on his part to repreſent all matters to the Duke agreeable to his Inſtructions, and found in him a ready diſpoſition to embrace all the Propoſals made him by the Pope, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Enterpriſe againſt <hi>Geneva,</hi> provided, that with the conſent both of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> he might poſſeſs, and enjoy that City: This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was eaſily admitted on the ſide of <hi>Spain</hi>; but they well knew, that it would never be granted by <hi>France,</hi> which had long aſpired to that Dominion; to which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would accord, being more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſee that place the Capital Throne of the new Religion, than a Seat of the <hi>French</hi> Power; for that being near to the Dukedom of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> might prove an ill Neighbour to that part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Howſoever, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> might follow the Pope's incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in concurrence with the <hi>French</hi> as far as prudence, and caution directed, he diſpatched <hi>Don Antonio de Toledo</hi> his Ambaſſadour into <hi>France</hi> to offer unto that King his utmoſt aſſiſtance, and to joyn his Arms unto his for the total ruin, and extirpation of Hereſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:50681:289"/>But the Court of <hi>France</hi> would yield no ear to either of theſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; they would gladly indeed have had the poſſeſſion of <hi>Geneva,</hi> but the Enterpriſe ſeemed difficult whileſt the Civil Wars continued, and whileſt <hi>Geneva</hi> remained in League with the <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to afford their utmoſt ſuccour, and aid unto that place: and as to the National Synod they perſiſted in their reſolution, promiſing the Pope that nothing ſhould be attempted therein derogatory to his Power, and the Authority of the Church. But this aſſurance did little ſatisfy the jealouſie of the Pope, who ſuſpected the very Prelats to be tainted with Hereſie, and to have an inclination to ſet up a <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, as they called it, ſeparate, and independant of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>The fear and jealouſie hereof conſtrained the Pope poſitively to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve on a General Council, and to haſten the convocation thereof with all ſpeed poſſible, ſuppoſing that the convention of a General Council would break the former Meaſures, and invalidate the Authority of all National Synods: This being agreed, the next thing propoſed, was the place; which the Pope would have had to be his own Town of <hi>Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> but that he knew, it would be generally diſliked by the Prelats; nor would the <hi>Spaniards</hi> conſent to have it held at <hi>Milan,</hi> for though they were zealous Catholicks, yet in matters of worldly intereſt they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted the Pope, as much as other Princes: In fine, <hi>Trent</hi> was agreed to be the moſt commodious, and leaſt ſubject to exceptions of any: howſoever the <hi>French</hi> were of another Opinion, as was alſo the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour who propoſed <hi>Wormes, Triers, Conſtance,</hi> or <hi>Hagunaw,</hi> as more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; for that the Proteſtants did ſo abhor the name of <hi>Trent,</hi> that they would take a prejudice to any thing formed there; nor would they endure to have the Council ſtiled a Continuation of a former, but one new, and eſtabliſhed on its own foundation: nor was this the only ſcruple of the Emperor; for he declared, that he could not anſwer for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, unleſs it were firſt prepared, and diſpoſed by a General Diet, nor would the Clergy of his hereditary Countries be induced to be preſent at the Council, unleſs the Cup in the Sacrament were firſt granted to the Laiety, and Licenſe for the Prieſts to marry; but all theſe matters being diametrically oppoſite to the Papal intereſt, the Pope declared his reſolution was, rather to give his life, than his aſſent thereunto.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the numbers of thoſe of the Reformed Religion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed greatly in <hi>France</hi>; ſo that it was reſolved, in caſe a General Council were not ſpeedily aſſembled, that a National Synod ſhould meet at <hi>Meaux</hi> on the 13th. of <hi>January</hi> 1561. for the tumults, and combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about Religion were ſo preſſing that they required a ſpeedy, and an effectual cure: the fear of which ſo touched the Pope, as did alſo the Declaration of the Emperor; that taking no notice of the exceptions of either, he reſolved to ſurmount the difficulties, and therewith ſigned the Bull for calling a Council, to commence on <hi>Eaſter</hi> day 1561. giving this Title thereunto, <hi>Indictio Concilii Tridentini,</hi> as if it had been to be a New, and not the continuation of a former Council: howſoever in the body of the Bull the word <hi>Continuation</hi> being mentioned, it gave great ſcandal and offence to all, though the Pope's Legats endeavoured to ſmooth it over, by ſaying, that the <hi>Continuation</hi> could be no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any reviſion of what had formerly paſſed, nor hinder the Council from repealing any Act which had been Decreed, and ordained in the times of <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Julius</hi> III.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:50681:290"/>And now <hi>Francis</hi> II. King of <hi>France</hi> being dead, and his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> IX. a Youth of ten years of age ſucceeding, gave great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of a happy change to the Proteſtants, for that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> having declared himſelf of the Reformed Religion, to whom of right as firſt Prince of the Blood, the Government belonged, during the minority of the King, and that he was ruled much by the Counſels of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>de Coligny,</hi> who was the grand Protector of the Reformed, gave them hopes, that the ſeverity of proceedings againſt them would be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and liberty of Conſcience granted to the whole Kingdom: the which though it did not take effect fully to their deſires, yet at an Aſſembly of the Eſtates at <hi>Orleance,</hi> it was ordained, That an Arreſt of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be given, and all penal Proceſſes ſtopped which were made againſt any for account of Religion: and at the ſame time Orders were given to the Prelats to prepare themſelves for their Journey to <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time the Proteſtant Princes were aſſembled at <hi>Naumbourg,</hi> with intention to guard themſelves from the Plots which would be contrived againſt them in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>; and to take off the reproach of Diviſions, and diſagreement in the points of Faith amongſt themſelves. But ſuch was the variety then of Opinions that it was difficult to concur in one Symbol of Faith; for the Confeſſion of <hi>Augsburg</hi> had lately been printed in ſeveral Editions, and every one with ſome difference from an other. And as to a General Council they petitioned the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that ſuch an one might be convened as was free, and where the Pope might not preſide, and overawe the Votes of the Proteſtants; the which requeſt they made rather in excuſe for their not going to <hi>Trent,</hi> than out of any proſpect of a conceſſion to their grant.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Pope having ſent two Nuntios to the Emperor, he adviſed them to go to <hi>Naumbourg,</hi> accompanied with two of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, and receive the ſenſe of the Aſſembly which was there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened: The Proteſtants received the Ambaſſadours with great reſpect, and heard the Nuntios with equal civilities; but ſtill continuing firm to their Principles, declared that they could not acknowledg the Pope's ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and therefore could not eſteem themſelves obliged to make known unto the Pope the Opinion they had of a Council, having already ſignified their thoughts thereof unto the Emperor: with the like cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they were received at <hi>Norimberg, Frankfort, Ausbourg,</hi> and other Proteſtant Towns. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi> at the ſame time refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to admit the Abbot <hi>Martininguez</hi> ſent by the Pope, within her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions: And the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> in like manner denied entrance to the Nuncios within his State, ſaying, That neither his Father nor he having ever had to do with the Pope, he knew no buſineſs his Nuntios could have with him. Thus did theſe Nuntios meet Oppoſitions in all parts, nor did they find any encouraging compliance in the Emperor himſelf, who inſiſted on the Indiction of a new Council, which was not founded on the <hi>Continuation,</hi> or baſis of a former. <hi>France</hi> likewiſe made many exceptions to the Bull of Indiction, being for a <hi>New</hi> and not for a <hi>Continuation</hi> of the Old Council; Nor was this all; many other things concurring in that Kingdom to the diminution of the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:<note place="margin">1561.</note> for not onely were the penal Laws againſt the Proteſtants ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, but alſo at a Convention of the Eſtates at <hi>Orleance,</hi> the Pope's Annates or yearly Revenue was taken off and all Moneys for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50681:290"/>
to be carried to <hi>Rome</hi>; the agreement between <hi>Leo</hi> X. and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the Firſt was made void; and all Friars, and other Religious were made ſubject to the Biſhop of their Dioceſe. So that <hi>France</hi> ſeemed in a manner to be loſt: onely <hi>Spain</hi> being a people not given much to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, adhered to the Pope's Authority, and to a Continuation of the Old Council.</p>
               <p>The Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> approaching which was the time appointed for the opening the Council; the Pope deputed the Cardinals of <hi>Mantoua, Warmia, Seripanda,</hi> and <hi>Simonette</hi> to be his Legats, and Preſidents of the Council, and haſtned all the Biſhops of <hi>Italy</hi> to repair unto <hi>Trent,</hi> that ſo they might counterballance the number of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Biſhops, who came, as was believed, with no other intention, than to gain one Point, which was, that a General Council in its Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, was ſuperiour and above the Authority of the Pope; a Poſition which the Biſhops of <hi>Italy,</hi> who had the honour of being the Head of all the Clergy, ought on no terms whatſoever to admit.</p>
               <p>But as yet there was a very thin appearance of Biſhops at <hi>Trent</hi>; for the eyes of all were fixed on the iſſue, which the Convention of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates at <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Conference at <hi>Poiſſy</hi> would produce, which in every Act ſtruck at the Pope's Authority, and expoſed unto the people the corruptions and abuſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea. In fine, after all, the Queen Regent wrote a Letter to the Pope, wherein ſhe repreſented to him the great numbers of Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> and the daily encreaſe of them; to ſuppreſs which a Reformation in many things was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; as namely, to take away Images out of the Churches; the Spittle, and Exorciſms in Baptiſm, to grant the Euchariſtical Chalice to the Laiety, to admit the Divine Service in the vulgar Tongue, and expunge the late Feſtival of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> out of the Kalendar; All and every Point of which were ſuch mortal blows to the Church, that the Pope could not think thereof with any patience, nor give other anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, than that thoſe, and other matters ſhould be deferred to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the Council.</p>
               <p>With theſe expectations, and Diſcourſes the time was protracted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the month of <hi>December,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1561.</note> by which time there was a conſiderable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Biſhops at <hi>Trent,</hi> ſo that the Pope commanded without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay, that the Council ſhould be commenced; but by reaſon of ſome other Obſtructions, and at the deſire of the Emperor's Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours it was again deferred until the middle of <hi>January</hi> following.</p>
               <p>The firſt Seſſion was held the 18th. of <hi>January</hi>;<note place="margin">1562.</note> at which the firſt preliminary afforded great matter of Diſpute; for it was there to be made a ſtanding Rule, That nothing ſhould be propounded, but what was firſt moved by the Legats, <hi>Proponentibus Legatis</hi>: which being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by four <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelats, was notwithſtanding over-ruled by the greater number, and the next Seſſions appointed for the 26th. of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> following.</p>
               <p>In the mean time on the 17th. of <hi>January</hi> the Edict was made at St. <hi>Germaines,</hi> whereby the Proteſtants had liberty given them to have their Churches, or Temples without the Cities, to live under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the King in obſervance of their own Diſcipline, Provided, that they taught nothing contrary to the Doctrine of the Old and New Teſtament, and to the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>At the beginning of this Seſſion the Marquis of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> who was Ambaſſadour for <hi>Spain,</hi> inſtantly urged that this Council might be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a <hi>Continuation</hi> of the former under <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Julius</hi>; but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Ambaſſadours made ſuch fierce oppoſition that nothing for that time was concluded therein: after which the Marquis <hi>de Peſcara</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Trent</hi> upon pretence that the affairs of his Government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his preſence at <hi>Milan</hi>; though in reality it was to avoid a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours, who were then upon their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Trent,</hi> namely, the Lord of <hi>Lanſac, Ferrier</hi> who was a Preſident of Parliament, and <hi>Fabre</hi> Lord of <hi>Pibrac,</hi> one alſo of the Long-Robe, who arrived two or three days after the departure of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour.</p>
               <p>And now miſunderſtandings encreaſed between the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Mantoua</hi> himſelf who was one of the Pope's Legats, being ſuſpected of not having had ſufficient zeal for the Authority of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he had not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded the Votes of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Party, who would have declared this preſent Council a <hi>Continuation</hi> of the former: ſo that it came to be debated at <hi>Rome,</hi> whether it were not neceſſary to recall the Cardinal of <hi>Mantoua</hi> from his Preſidency, or to place ſome other Collegue in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion above him. On the other ſide the Council was as much diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was with <hi>Trent</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that many things were deſigned there to moderate the Papal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and give a greater latitude of Power to Princes, and Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the exerciſe both of the ſpiritual and temporal juriſdiction: nor were the Prelats free from all variance amongſt themſelves, whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts ſeveral times interfering one with other, adminiſtred ſubject of Diſpute, which ended in Reproaches, and Obloquies of one againſt the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours being admitted to Audience in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation aſſembled the 26th of <hi>May; Fibrac</hi> made a very eloquent and pathetical Oration, wherein he reproved the indiſcreet and ill-guided zeal of thoſe, who would not part with one inſignificant ceremony, to gain the common quiet, and peace of the Church, and the ſalvation of many ſouls. He alſo openly declaimed againſt the violence impoſed in the Council, which ought to have been free; And conſidering that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Councils had for ſome Ages paſt ſuffered their Opinions and Sentiments to be overſwayed by a ſuperiour Power, and ſerve an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt for whoſe ſake they were not aſſembled, he did therefore now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the Fathers then preſent, that they would take ſuch meaſures as might without mixture of other conſiderations cure, and heal the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Church, produce Peace, and propagate Charity in the World; and ſecure the Flock of Chriſt from uſurpation, and Oppreſſion. This Speech ſo ſtartled the Council, that the Prolocutor having nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, gave an end to the Congregation of that Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:50681:291"/>On the 4th. of <hi>June</hi> a Seſſion was held, in which the Commiſſions of Ambaſſadours were read and an Anſwer given by the Prolocutor to the Speech of <hi>Pibrac,</hi> which was ill reſented by the <hi>French,</hi> and then the Seſſion ended, and another appointed on the 16th. of <hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time ſeveral Congregations were held, whereat the chief matter debated was the adminiſtration of the Sacrament of the Holy Communion to the Laiety in both kinds: the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours contended for it, as did alſo the Miniſter of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>; and on that ſubject joyned together in a Memorial: in which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, and produced the Writings of the Popes <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Julius,</hi> wherein they had acknowledged the neceſſity of yielding the Cup to ſuch of the Laiety, as ſhould demand it, it being the only means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to conſerve the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi> in obedience to the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> That already in the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary</hi> the People did force the Prieſts to adminiſter the Sacrament to them in both kinds, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for want thereof to ſeize their Eſtates, and take away their lives.</p>
               <p>After many Debates on divers Subjects at ſeveral Congregations, at length the day of Seſſion came being the 16th of <hi>July</hi>; at which the Decrees were read, and four Canons confirmed with <hi>Anathemas</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto annexed. Firſt, That the faithful Laiety are not obliged by any Command to communicate in both kinds. Secondly, That the Church upon very good grounds, and reaſons had taken away the Cup from the Laiety. Thirdly, That whoſoever receives the Bread onely, receives Jeſus Chriſt, as fully, and intirely to all ends, and purpoſes of ſpiritual Grace, and Salvation. Fourthly, That the Communion is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for Infants. All which was impertinent to the queſtion demanded, namely, whether ſuch as were not ſatisfied herewith might not receive the Sacrament in both kinds, if deſired by them: wherefore to pleaſe the <hi>Germans,</hi> who made great noiſe about this Point, the determination thereof was referred to the following Seſſion: likewiſe many other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were enacted, and decreed for Reformation of abuſes committed by the Queſtors, who were a ſort of Raſcals, and Caterpillers, who under the pretence of recommendatory Letters to all Good People, exhorting them to contribute their Alms to pious Works, ſuch as the building of Hoſpitals for the ſick, and for maintenance of Orphans, framed a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand damnable Artifices to extort Money from the People; in which for the more formality they diſguiſed themſelves in ſtrange Habits, and by ſound of Bell carried before them, aſſembled the People, and offered their Indulgences to ſale, terrifying thoſe who refuſed to buy them with a thouſand Curſes, and Maledictions; the which Money by agreement with Officers at <hi>Rome</hi> was appropriated to their own uſe and a part to the benefit of thoſe, who had procured the Authority for raiſing theſe Collections. So that this abuſe was condemned, and wholly aboliſhed. Likewiſe other Decrees paſſed for regulation of Dioceſes, Pariſhes, and Non-Reſidencies: And in the mean time Poſts ran continually from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and back again with Treaties, and Negotiations between the Ambaſſadours of ſeveral Princes, and the Legats, beſides a thouſand other Intrigues formed by the Prelats, who were encreaſed to a number four times greater, than in the time of the two preceding Councils under <hi>Julius</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> III. All which in the concluſion produced ſo little, that we may well apply that ſaying.</p>

The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours attended all this time in the Council with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reaſonable ſatisfaction; for they obſerved that the moſt material Points of Religion were debated, and determined in the abſence of their Biſhops, all being carried by the Vogue, and ſuffrages of <hi>Spaniards, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes,</hi> and <hi>Italians:</hi> Wherefore they earneſtly wrote to the King to haſten his Biſhops, who might maintain and ſupport the Points they had to propoſe for a Reformation; for want of whom and that nothing could be propoſed in the Council, but by the Legats, that clauſe avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Method agreed, <hi>Proponentibus Legatis,</hi> the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> became abſolute Moderator in all Diſputes, carrying every thing at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, by the great numbers of their Penſionary Biſhops; and in ſhort, that there was very little hopes of any good reſult from the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Council.</p>
               <p>After this Seſſion; matters were preparing at ſeveral Congregations againſt the next, which was appointed to be held on the 17th. of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> for confirmation of the Sacrifice of the Maſs: in diſcuſſing of which Point; an unlucky queſtion was ſtarted, Whether Jeſus Chriſt did then offer, and ſacrifice himſelf, when he firſt inſtituted the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt: for if he did not at that time ſacrifice himſelf, then the Maſs which is founded on this Inſtitution, <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> is no Sacrifice: and if he did ſacrifice himſelf, it muſt have been propitiatory, and then the Sacrifice on the Croſs had been unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and unneceſſary; for it is ſaid, <hi>He Offered himſelf but once; and then the ſins of mankind had been expiated by the Sacrifice of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt:</hi> the which created ſo much doubt, and Diſpute, that ſome were of Opinion, that it were beſt to leave the ceremonies of the <hi>Roman</hi> Maſs free, and undetermined by any particular Decree or Canon of the Church: the which Opinion though diſpleaſing to the generality of the Council, was yet ſeconded by the Biſhop of <hi>quinque Eccleſiae,</hi> the Emperor's Ambaſſador; who moved that <hi>Germany</hi> might not be obliged to any uniformity of Ceremonies, and particularly might have the Cup granted to their Laiety in the Sacrament, and not be obliged to have their Service in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. The which he repreſented in the name of his Maſter to be ſo agreeable and neceſſary to the preſent State of that Country, that without ſuch a Diſpenſation it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to contain his people under any obedience to the Church, or oblige them to make reſiſtance againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> whoſe violences they leſs feared, than the impoſitions, and tyrannies of the Papal Sea. This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being argued with great heat on both ſides, and without any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, it was moved, that this Propoſal of the <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Pope; but this alſo was oppoſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Lavaur</hi>; who argued that it was very improper to remit that to the Pope, which he had referred to the judgment of that Aſſembly: and that it might reaſonably be queſtioned whether that reference were made to him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of being Superiour, or Inferiour to the Council; and then in that caſe, that queſtion was firſt to be determined. Howſoever, at length it was carried in the Affirmative, and the queſtion referred to the judgment of the Pope to conſider, and determine under what reſtrictions, and circumſtances the Cup might be granted to the Laiety.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:50681:292"/>In this manner with a thouſand Diſputes and difficulties,<note place="margin">1562.</note> an other Seſſion was held on the 17th. of <hi>September.</hi> At which after the uſual Ceremonies were performed; they immediately fell upon the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars treated in the preceding Congregation, containing nine ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, all which were confirmed, and ſtrengthned with <hi>Anathemas:</hi> the contents of which were to eſtabliſh the Doctrine of the neceſſity of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Sacrifice, to verifie the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and that the ſame was truly and really propitiatory. The Ceremonies alſo of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and the purity of the Canon of the Maſs, and the celebration of it in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, were all confirmed: as likewiſe that the Maſs might be performed without other Communicants than the Prieſt onely, that it might be celebrated in honour of the Saints, and that the Wine ought to be uſed with a mixture of Water. To which particulars the Fathers gave their Placet 22, or 23, only excepted, amongſt which the chief was the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> who could by no means be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to reliſh the Doctrine, that Jeſus Chriſt did offer himſelf in the firſt inſtitution of the Holy Euchariſt. Moreover, other Decrees were read, and paſſed relating to the regulation of Biſhopricks, giving the Biſhops full power to inſpect the nature of Diſpenſations, whether they were fairly or ſubreptitiouſly procured; as alſo Authority to viſit Hoſpitals, and Colledges, and ſurvey the Buildings of religious Foundations, with this clauſe, and under this Character howſoever, as being Delegates of the Holy Sea. Likewiſe other things paſſed of no great moment, with which this Seſſion was concluded.</p>
               <p>The Decrees of this Seſſion were ſatisfactory to very few: for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror remained highly diſpleaſed, that the matter of the Cup was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Pope, well knowing that the conceſſion of this Point would have been much more acceptable to his Subjects from the Council, than from the Pope, againſt whom they had demonſtrated a deteſtable averſion. Exceptions were alſo made to that Decree, which gives the Biſhops a Power over religious Houſes contrary to the intention of the Donors, who deſired that the Revenues, and management thereof ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by Lay-perſons: for thus ſaid they, was the manner how the Clergy poſſeſſed themſelves of the Lands, and Revenues of Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and Colledges, and other religious Foundations, making themſelves Owners, and abſolute Maſters of what they were onely Stewards, and Adminiſtrators: and this formerly the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> looked upon as an Uſurpation, and encroachment of the Clergy on the civil Right, and Juriſdiction; the like judgment alſo they gave of Wills and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the inſpection into which by the Biſhop, was judged an intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the Secular Power.</p>
               <p>Howſoever, the Pope remained extreamly ſatisfied with the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Seſſion, all things having been managed according to his own Orders, and Inſtructions. And now for the future he reſolved to ſtand upon his guard, and countermine the Plots, and Artifices of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> who came, as he was well aſſured, with vaſt deſigns, as did alſo the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops who were armed with Maxims diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to his Authority; againſt whom and the other <hi>Ultra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montanes,</hi> he reſolved to reinforce his numbers, and power in the Council by new recruits of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:50681:293"/>The ſame day that this laſt Seſſion was concluded, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours received Letters from their Maſter, requiring them to move the Council, that a ſtop might be given to their proceedings in matters of Doctrine, until the Biſhops from <hi>France</hi> ſhould arrive; and that in the mean time they would prepare matters tending to the Reformation of manners and abuſes crept into the Church, which was the only Sovereign remedy capable to cure the diſtempers of the Church: the which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions the Ambaſſadours having made known to the Legats, by whom according to due Order all matters were propoſed; received this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from them: That they could not invert the Rule, and method al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſigned, for deciſion of the Doctrines of Faith, and reformation of Manners, but were forced to proceed, in their uſual courſe, without any delay, and interruption; and if their King had any thing to propoſe, it might be done by them his Ambaſſadours, whom he had deputed to repreſent his concernments at the Council. This Anſwer did little pleaſe the Ambaſſadors, ſo that they appeared openly diſcontented: and the Pope on the other ſide fearing leſt the power, and wiſdom of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> ſhould be ſtronger than his Auxiliaries of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, endeavoured by his Legat in <hi>France</hi> to take him off, perſuading him that his Negotiations in the Council could procure him no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in regard that all things were already done, and concluded.</p>
               <p>And indeed they were much in the right, for the Legats having a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to diſpatch, and put a period to the Council, were reſolved to hearken unto no delays, but to proceed to the two Articles of Doctrine, namely, the Sacraments (as they called them) of Ordination, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which were the onely Points remaining to be examined, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. On which Points the Congregations began to treat on the 25th of <hi>September,</hi> and continued their Diſcourſes and Treatiſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon until the ſecond of <hi>October.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1562.</note> But all the Diſputes which aroſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe Subjects ſeemed impertinent, and loſs of time to the Biſhop of <hi>quinque Eccleſiae,</hi> and the other <hi>Hungarian</hi> Prelats, as alſo to the <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi>; who at a private Conference amongſt themſelves conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that their meeting was chiefly with deſign to reform abuſes in manners which were crept into the Church, rather than to determine matters of Faith; that in this work it was neceſſary to begin the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the Head, and ſource from whence the ſtreams ought to be derived in their purity; reflecting with deep ſenſe of diſpleaſure, on the encroachments which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> made on their Epiſcopal Dignity: and in order hereunto the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Braganca</hi> was of Opinion, that the firſt thing to be done, was to reduce the Cardinals to their primary Inſtitution; for that until the 10th. Century they were mere Prieſts; and onely began from that time to exalt their Dignities, and yet until the 12th. Century they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed inferiour to Biſhops; though ſince that time by ſeveral degrees and ſteps they have ſo elevated, and promoted their quality with Titles, and extention of Power, that a Biſhop is eſteemed to have had honour ſufficient, in being onely admitted a domeſtick Chaplain to a Cardinal, and therefore to bring the Epiſcopal Dignity again into requeſt, it were neceſſary to have it expreſly declared by the Council, that that <hi>Hierarchy</hi> is <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and that Biſhops hold their Power, and Authority im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Jeſus Chriſt, and not from the Pope. The which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50681:293"/>
came at a ſeaſonable, and an opportune time to be diſcuſſed; for one Article under conſideration being then to define that the Order of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy was above that of Prieſthood, it fell naturally into the Enquiry, Whether that Superiority was by Divine Right or not. Now the Legats at firſt not comprehending the meaning and deſign, why this queſtion was propoſed with ſo much heat, ſuffered it to proceed to a free exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: but ſo ſoon as they diſcovered by the Biſhop of <hi>Fortoſa</hi> who was a <hi>Spaniard</hi> and yet Penſioner of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Granada,</hi> and <hi>Barganca</hi> intended on the conſequences of this Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to infer, that their Order being eſtabliſhed by Divine Right and not received from the Papal Chair, their Power would ſeem more inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in themſelves, and leſs dependant on the Supreme Biſhop. So that the Legats being awakened by this intimation, denied to have that queſtion put on the tryal, and notwithſtanding the high and paſſionate words which intervened between them, and the Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Spain,</hi> they poſitively forbad the Divines to treat farther on that Subject. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever after the Legats had conſidered, that the Authority of theſe great Men had ſo deeply impreſſed this Opinion in the minds of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Clergy, as was not to be defaced by the ſingle daſh of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Power; they appointed four Divines to confute the Arguments of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelats, and to prove that the Biſhops held their Power from the Pope, and not immediately from Jeſus Chriſt; and that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy was no otherwiſe of Divine Right, than as the whole Order of that <hi>Hierarchy</hi> was inherent in the Pope, as the Head, and ſource from whence all Eccleſiaſtical Power was derived; by virtue of which, it was in him onely to ordain Biſhops over particular Churches, to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, enlarge, or reſtrain their juriſdiction, and to depoſe, ſuſpend, and transfer their truſt, and dignity unto others, as he in his wiſdom, and infallible judgment ſhould determine, and command. In defence of this Opinion <hi>Lainez</hi> General of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> an Orator of particular Note was appointed in a ſet Speech, and at a Congregation purpoſely called to hear him on this queſtion; and thereupon ſuch liberty was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him of Diſcourſe, that he declaimed for the ſpace of two hours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any interruption, alledging every thing which with any appearance of colour might be deduced from Scripture, or the Antient Fathers; all which was concluded with the general Applauſe of the Papal Party; whileſt others of the contrary Opinion were offended, and netled in the higheſt degree. Amongſt the reſt the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> at the next Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſpake high, and proteſted publickly againſt this Doctrine, which (as he ſaid) was invented by <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who thereby merited the reward of a Cardinals Hat, that the gentle Government of the Church was degenerated into Tyranny, that the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt was made a Slave, and proſtituted to the Arbitrary pleaſure of a ſingle Perſon. That for his part he was weary of thoſe affronts, and contempts which were daily offered to the Epiſcopal Dignity, on which every petty Monk began to trample; nor could he longer ſupport the neglects which the Order of begging Friers put on that Sacred Function, nor the inſolences of the upſtart Company of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who being neither Seculars, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, but a mix'd compoſition of both, acknowledged no other Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but their own. All which was delivered with ſuch heat and vehemence, as moved the bloud, and farther incenſed the minds of all
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50681:294"/>
thoſe who were already enflamed with Reſentments againſt the Speech of <hi>Lainez</hi>; ſo that there was a common murmur through the whole Council, univerſally concluding that the Speech of the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> was a clear refutation of all the frothy Oratory, delivered by the General of the <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> howſoever the Legats ſtill perſiſted in their Aſſertion, and for ſupport thereof were forming a new Party againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelats. But theſe Diſputes, and heats were for a while ſuppreſſed by the many inſtances which were made by the <hi>Spaniards, French, Germans</hi> and others for a Reformation; deſiring that all other Debates, and Controverſies being laid aſide, the Council would be wholly intent to that great work of rectifying abuſes, which was the onely means that could produce peace, and quiet in the Church. But the Legats withſtood this ſhock, and endeavoured by delays and Artifices to evade this Aſſault made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Papal Power: on which they dreaded the ſtorm, which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> would make thereupon; for he being now on his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Trent,</hi> gave out in all places through which he travelled, that his Deſign was to abate the greatneſs and pride of the Pope, and to eaſe the People of their Oppreſſions, and Tyrannies which they ſuffered by the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Cardinal was a Perſon of great Power, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and Revenue in <hi>France,</hi> and therefore impatient of ſubjection to a Foreiner, and deſirous himſelf to be Pope, or ſupreme Head of the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> Church; to break all theſe Meaſures, and countermine theſe Plots, the Legats propoſed ſeveral, and different means: ſometimes it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that the Pope ſhould come to <hi>Bolegna,</hi> that his near reſidence might over-awe the Council; but not knowing how this might ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; the next expedient was to adjourn the Council to ſome other place, to pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ogue it for ſome certain time, and in fine, if all ſhould fail, then to diſſolve it. But this Remedy ſeeming too violent, it was judged more convenient to ſuſpend for a while the ordinary courſe of the Congregations, hoping that with time the ſpirits, and heats which <hi>Lainez</hi> Diſcourſe had raiſed, would abate, and be allayed. But this Remedy produced a contrary effect; for the Prelats being at leiſure, banded together, and dividing into ſeveral Factions, and Meetings, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as many Councils, as were Parties, or intereſts. Thus ſeven days paſſing without Congregations, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> grew weary of the delays, and with a haughty, and arrogant manner aſſociating themſelves together came to the Legats, and poſſitively demanded, that Epiſcopacy ſhould be declared to be by Divine Right, to oppoſe this <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, natural to the humour of that Nation; eighteen or twenty Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats were ſet up to contradict this Demand, and require that no Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination ſhould be made of that Controverſie. So that the Legats making uſe of theſe diviſions to excuſe themſelves, not being able to ſatisfie both Parties, all things remained in ſuſpenſe, and in the mean time there was nothing but confuſion, and tumult, and Conſults, how, and in what manner to make Parties, and Intereſts; which gave the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats juſt cauſe to fear the ill effect which theſe Diſorders might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
               <p>After this intermiſſion of Congregations; on the 3d. of <hi>November</hi> they began again to meet; when many Expedients were propoſed to accommodate the Diſputes which made ſo great a noiſe, namely, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Epiſcopacy, and the Reſidence of Biſhops in their reſpective Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes,

were inſtituted by Divine Right. As to the latter the Cardinal of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> one of the Legats, did propoſe to have the queſtion remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided; but howſoever, that every Biſhop ſhould be obliged under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalties to reſide in his Dioceſs; it being not material, whether ſuch reſidence were <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> or not, provided that every perſon, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and performed his duty therein. But the firſt queſtion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted with more paſſion, the Biſhop of <hi>Segovia</hi> averring, that the Order of Epiſcopacy was declared by the Council held under <hi>Julius</hi> III. to be <hi>Jure Divino.</hi> Upon reading the Act, though the <hi>Roman</hi> Party would not dare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſay, that the Council had erred in that Point; yet they endeavoured to evade the force of it, by diſtinguiſhing between the Order abſtractively, and the Juriſdiction of it.</p>
               <p>During theſe Conteſts the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> arrived at <hi>Trent,</hi> where he made his entry on Horſe-back with a great Train, and Pomp, ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the two Cardinals of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> and <hi>Seripande,</hi> who were the principal Legats. By this addition the Council began to be nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; the Prelats onely amounting to the number of two hundred and eighteen, which though much inferiour to Antient Councils, were how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a greater appearance than any, that had yet been known in <hi>Trent.</hi> The favourers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Party looked on this increaſe, as a recruit of Auxiliaries, which were come in to reinforce their Enemies: and therefore to redouble their vigilance, and augment their force, the Pope diſpeeded all the Power he had of Cardinals and Biſhops to the Council; fearing that the Union which was formed between the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, French,</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> would be too powerful for his <hi>Italian</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents.</p>
               <p>The 23d. of <hi>November</hi> was the day when the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> made his firſt appearance in the Congregation: when as a Prologue to all the reſt, the King's Letters were firſt read, containing little more, than to pray, and exhort the Council in general terms, that they would bend all their labours, and endeavours, towards a Reformation, and to thoſe means, which might reſtore Peace, and Unity in the Church.</p>
               <p>The Letters being read, the Cardinal, in an elaborate, and pathetical Speech began to relate the calamities which the Wars about Religion had cauſed in <hi>France:</hi> deſiring the Council that for a remedy thereof they would be pleaſed to be indulgent to the Proteſtants, in condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their weak, and tender Conſciences ſo far, as was conſiſtent with the Doctrines of Faith: and then declaiming againſt the corruptions which were crept into the Church, he inſtantly deſired, that an inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might be made into the many abuſes of which the Clergy were guilty, to whom he ingeniouſly applyed the Hiſtory of the Prophet <hi>Jonas.</hi> We, ſaid he, are the cauſe of all theſe ſtorms, we that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and fled from the face of God, caſt us into the Seas, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt will abate. This Diſcourſe was ſeconded by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour <hi>du Ferrier,</hi> much to the ſame purpoſe, and then concluded, thus: If you ask me, why <hi>France</hi> is not in Peace, and what is the cauſe of all theſe diviſions which thus miſerably rend, and tear out the bowels of that diſtreſſed Nation; I muſt anſwer you in the ſame manner as <hi>Jehu</hi> did to <hi>Joram</hi> 2 <hi>Kings c.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 22. when he asked, <hi>Is it peace,</hi> Jehu? <hi>How can it be peace, ſo long as the whoredoms of thy mother</hi> Jezebel, <hi>and her witchcrafts are ſo many?</hi> In fine, he frankly told them, That in caſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50681:295"/>
they took not ſome courſe to reform the diſorders in <hi>France,</hi> all the bloud that was there ſpilt, would be laid to their charge: and though this plain dealing did infinitely diſpleaſe the favourers of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet they judged it ſeaſonable to diſſemble their Reſentments, fearing leſt <hi>France</hi> in that doubtful ſtate, ſhould make a total defection from the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now it is curious, and worthy our obſervation to conſider, that whileſt the ſpecious Propoſal of Reformation was offered, it was plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and conſented unto in general terms by every Party, and Intereſt; but when they deſcended to particulars, and would apply the remedies to the reſpective abuſes, then there appeared a ſtrange, and prodigious diverſity in their Opinions, every one being willing to reform others, but not himſelf, or his Party, eaſily obſerving the Moat in their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Eye, but not the Beam in their own. The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> would gladly aſſent to a reformation of Princes, and Biſhops, but not yield to any inſpection which might be made into the corruptions of their Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, or into the Power which they had uſurped. The Biſhops could eaſily agree to a reformation of Manners in the Courts of the Pope, and of their reſpective Princes, but could not hear of having their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or Revenues retrenched. The Kings and Princes inſtantly preſſed to have a reformation of the Clergy both of the Head and of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but could not endure to hear of having their <hi>Regalia</hi> diminiſhed, or the Power of conferring, and diſpoſing Benefices according to their pleaſure. Wherefore it was impoſſible, that all their different Intereſts could ever be reconciled, or at the end concenter in a ſingle <hi>Tertio,</hi> or common agreement.</p>
               <p>Wherefore being wearied with theſe Debates, and finding out new Expedients, which could never ſquare with the form of ſuch Diſſenting Intereſts; they again re-aſſumed the old and weariſom Debates about the being of Reſidencies, and Epiſcopacy by Divine Right in which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the former heats were abated. The Biſhop of <hi>Auranch</hi> declared poſitively, that his Opinion was, that Epiſcopacy was by Divine Right, and that the Authority of the Pope differed not from that of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Biſhop, but onely in degree, and was reſtrained within the limits of the Canons: He farther applauded the Decrees of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which declared the abuſive Bulls of the Pope to be void in their own nature, and forbad to have them put into Execution; and thus much, ſaid he, the Power of my Maſter is able to verify, and make good. But the heats about Reſidencies began to abate; it being made appear, that if that Point were once gained, it would not onely be an eclipſe, but a total ruin of the Papal Authority; for if the Reſidence of Biſhops were declared to be by Divine Right, it would follow, that the Pope thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth remains deveſted of all Power to transfer, diminiſh, divide, or make any change, or alteration in the Epiſcopal Seas. All which though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> knew very well, and that their aim was onely to advance their own Intereſt and Authority, yet they would ſeem to maintain the contrary, and that this Conceſſion would ſerve to render the Papal Power more conſiderable, and glorious. In fine, it was agreed to ſend this Point about Reſidencies to the Pope by the Biſhop of <hi>Ventimille.</hi> Thus was this whole year conſumed in theſe Controverſies, the laſt day of <hi>December,</hi> concluding with a Congregation, at which it was reſolved, that the Seſſion ſhould be deferred for fifteen days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:50681:295"/>At the beginning of this year 1563.<note place="margin">1563.</note> the <hi>French</hi> propoſed thirty four Articles in order to a Reformation; the moſt part of which reſpected the Clergy, tending to the correction of abuſes in Ordinations and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of unworthy Perſons both for their lives, and knowledg, to places of eminence, and honour in the Church. Some alſo related to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the retrenchment of its Revenue, the exaction whereof was an agrievance to the People of <hi>France.</hi> Other Articles forbad Plurality of Benefices; and Moneys, or rewards to be given for adminiſtration of the Sacraments. It was alſo required that Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice might be rendred, and performed in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, at leaſt that the principal Prayers be pronounced both in the <hi>French</hi> and in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. That the Communion be delivered in both kinds. That Biſhops within their reſpective Dioceſes have a juriſdiction over the Religious in Monaſteries, as well as over Seculars. That all abuſes be taken away in the ſuperſtitious worſhip of Images, and the fond and vain imaginations which Men conceive of Reliques, Pilgrimages and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences. That the Doctrine, and practice of Penance ſhould be again renewed, and eſtabliſhed according to the cuſtom of the Primitive Church. All or moſt of which Articles were ungrateful to the Legats, both for the ſubſtance of them, and circumſtances with which they were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the Ambaſſadours at the ſame time declaring, that in caſe they were not granted, ſuch proviſions would be made in <hi>France</hi> by a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Council as were agreeable to the State of their Affairs. Howſoever the Legats ſeemed favourably to accept them, and diſpatched them to the Pope by the Biſhops of <hi>Viterbo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now by this time the Pope was ready to make a return of the concluſions he had made in the Point about Reſidencies, diſpatched from <hi>Trent</hi> by the Biſhop of <hi>Ventimille</hi>; the matter of which though couched with great Art, and in ſuch ambiguous terms as might admit of various interpretations; yet that artificial fraud could not paſs on ſuch ſubtil Heads, who for their Learning, and experience were choſen out of the wiſeſt Men of <hi>Europe</hi>; for they eaſily diſcovered the Pope's intent to advance himſelf above an Univerſal Council; they could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to have admitted him the Chief <hi>ſuper Eccleſias <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſas,</hi> but not <hi>ſuper Eccleſiam <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalem</hi>; that is over all Churches in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but not over the Univerſal Church as it was aggregated into one body in a General Council. Hereupon great Conteſts aroſe; the Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Rome</hi> produced in favour of the Pope's Authority a Canon made by the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> which having been received by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> gave them ſome trouble in what manner to make an Anſwer thereunto. But the <hi>French,</hi> who had never received the Articles of that Council for Canonical, oppoſed the Councils of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> againſt it, which had determined, that General Councils were ſuperiour to the Pope: but the <hi>Italians,</hi> who maintained, that the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> was Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, and that the Canons of <hi>Conſtance</hi> were partly received, and partly rejected, ſo heated their <hi>French</hi> Opponents, that Reaſons, and Arguments being on both ſides declined, the Diſpute ended with high words, and reproaches of one againſt the other. Which the Legats well obſerving, and that there could be no good iſſue of ſuch high Conteſts, deſired time to remit theſe matters to the Pope's Cenſures; and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded again to the Point about Reſidencies: the which having already
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50681:296"/>
cauſed inextricable difficulties (for the Pope's words did not pleaſe the Council) the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> propoſed ſomething by way of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, putting in ſome gentler terms which might ſerve the turn of both Parties: but the Legats penetrating with their accuſtomary A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteneſs into the words, found that the ſenſe would bear an Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which might be expounded in favour of the Opinion that Reſidencies were conſtituted by Divine Right. Wherefore ſlighting, or laying aſide the words which the Cardinal had projected, they framed another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own humour, and preſented it to the Congregation: the which ſo incenſed the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> that from thence forward, he began to deal plainly, and expreſs himſelf in free, and high terms, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting that for the future he would meddle no farther, for that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a ſecret Combination, which in Cabinet Conſults aſſumed to its ſelf an Authority to diſpoſe matters differing from the Sentiments of the General Council. That the Legats ſought nothing more than occaſions to break up the Council in diſcontent. That nothing was acted, but according to the will of the Legats, who moved by ſuch meaſures only as they received from the Pope, whoſe reſolution in every thing they expected from <hi>Rome</hi> according to that old ſaying, That the Holy Ghoſt was brought every week from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Trent</hi> in the Courriers Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle. That he for his part was reſolved to have patience until the next Seſſion, at which if matters were not managed with more fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, he was reſolved to retire into <hi>France</hi> with his <hi>French</hi> Nation then at the Council, where renouncing all farther applications to <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Trent,</hi> they were reſolved to aſſemble a National Council, by which they would eſtabliſh ſuch a form of Concordat, as ſhould be agreeable to the preſent ſtate of their Country, and which might ſecure the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the King and the quiet of his People. To the ſame purpoſe the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour expreſſed himſelf at <hi>Rome</hi>; but the Pope who had been long uſed to ſuch kind of Menaces, and a noiſe about National Councils; little regarded their Cenſures, or Threats: but briskly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That the Council was free even to a licentiouſneſs; that if there were Parties, and Factions, they were unknown to him, and were only made by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltramontane</hi> Biſhops, whoſe deſign was to trample on the Authority of the Papal Chair: And in this manner ſuch diſtractions, and Diſputes aroſe at <hi>Trent</hi> occaſioned by the Power and Intereſt which the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> had there with the greateſt part of the Clergy, that the Congregations were for ſome time ſuſpended, until the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Ventimille</hi> returned from <hi>Rome,</hi> freighted with abundance of Complements, and Salutes, and eſpecially with ſupplies of Mony for the Pope's Penſioners; and then the Congregations being again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, and with them the Diſcords renewed; it was agreed, that the next Seſſion ſhould be deferred until the 22th. of <hi>April,</hi> which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after <hi>Eaſter.</hi> The Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> though he ſeemed outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conſent hereunto with ſome reluctancy, and onely in compliance with the reſt of the Council, yet in reality he was well enough pleaſed, hoping that a ſhort time would put an end to the life of this Pope, who was very aged, and infirm; when he imagined that his Greatneſs, and Authority would be very inſtrumental in promoting ſuch a Perſon to the Papacy, as would be facil, and eaſie in granting every thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his deſires.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:50681:296"/>And now to allay a little the heats about the Divine Right of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopacy, and Reſidencies, the Council diverted their thoughts and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to eight ſeveral Points relating to Marriage. During which time, and the Interval between that, and the next Seſſion, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> took the opportunity to viſit the Emperor's Court at <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> which adminiſtred great cauſe of jealouſie to the Pope; who not onely obſerved the Cardinal's diſſaffection from his proceedings in the Council, but likewiſe from his Letter, wherein complaining of the many Factions, and Intrigues which his <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops had cauſed, he concludes, that if matters were carried on with the ſame Meaſures, there would remain nothing more for him, either to conſider, or act, than onely to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God to direct the Council with his Holy Inſpiration.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> being arrived at <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> where he remained five days, had frequent Conferences with the Emperor, and his Son the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> touching the many diſorders, and corruptions of the Council at <hi>Trent</hi>; as alſo of the means how, and in what manner the Cup might be reſtored to the Laiety; how Marriage might be granted, and diſpenſed to Prieſts; and Divine Service performed in the Vulgar Tongue; but more eſpecially their thoughts were buſied about reformation of the Church, and the diſſolute Manners both of the Head and Members of it.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal being returned to <hi>Trent</hi> kept all his Diſcourſes, and Negotiations at <hi>Inſpruck</hi> as a Secret, declaring himſelf onely in general terms, that he obſerved in the Emperor a paſſionate deſire of a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but yet without any diminution or abatement of the Papal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. About this time the Cardinal of <hi>Mantoua</hi> died, who was the firſt Preſident of the Council, by whoſe deceaſe the Cardinal <hi>Seripanda</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next Legat, took on him that Office until ſuch time as the Pope nominated two other Cardinals (namely <hi>Moron,</hi> and <hi>Navagier</hi> to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed into his place, the which he did with admirable expedition to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the inſtances, which the <hi>French</hi> might make in the behalf of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the Point of <hi>Celibacy,</hi> or ſingle lives of Prieſts which was one of the eight particulars relating to Marriage came into queſtion, which was reſerved until the time that the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> could be there preſent; in handling of which all the Divines agreed; that it was Hereſie to believe, that the Prieſts of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church being under a Vow, and an Eccleſiaſtical Canon to the contrary, were capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a lawful State of Marriage; onely the difficulty was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was in the Power of the Pope in ſome caſes to grant a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a Prieſt againſt his Vow of <hi>Celibacy,</hi> and Chaſtity; and whether the preſent emergencies, and neceſſities were ſuch, as might induce the Pope to grant ſuch Diſpenſations. In diſcuſſing of which queſtion, it was confeſſed, that the Oriental Churches, did frequently confer Holy Orders on Perſons, who were already married; but yet that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their cuſtom, to give liberty to unmarried Prieſts to change the State of their ſingle life. But others extended this liberty yet farther; not reſtraining even Monks from that ſatisfaction, in maintenance of which they alledged the Authority of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>; whoſe Opinion it was, That Monks taking Wives, their Marriage was Legal, though it was undecent, and what rendered them Prevaricators from their Vows to God, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:50681:297"/>
their Promiſes to the World. In fine, though the generality of Voices would not proceed ſo far as to make the marriage of Monks lawful, yet by Plurality of Votes, it was carried, that in ſome caſes a Diſpenſation might be granted for a Prieſt to marry: for which Sentence, and for hazarding that queſtion on its tryal; the Pope much blamed his Legats, in excuſe of which, they alledged their inabibility to withſtand the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt inſtances which the Emperors, and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours had made in that particular.</p>
               <p>About this time the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> received the bad news of the death of his Brother the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was murthered by a Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fian before the City of <hi>Orleans</hi>; which allarm'd the Cardinal and cauſed him to ſet a more ſecure Watch, and Guard over his own Perſon; nor was the Council leſs concerned in the death of this great Man, who was eſteemed the Head, and Chief Protector of the Catholick Party in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe troubles the Biſhop of <hi>quinque Eccleſiae</hi> returned from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpruck</hi> to <hi>Trent</hi> bringing two Letters with him from the Emperor; one whereof was to the Council, inſtantly exhorting them to labour in the work of Reformation; and another to the Pope, earneſtly entreating him not to diſſolve the Council, leſt thereby he ſhould give ſcandal to the Hereticks, and cauſe them to reproach, and divide both the Church, and its Aſſemblies. But above all, he deſired that the Council might be free, and not confined by the Orders of his Court, nor by ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of proceeding as ſtop'd the mouths of all but his Legats, there being nothing to be propounded but by their words, <hi>Proponentibus Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis:</hi> and in fine he complained, that after all the labours, and Diſputes of the Biſhops, and Divines to ſet things right, there was no concluſion, or eſtabliſhment of any matter, until it had firſt received its approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Rome.</hi> This bold Letter which the Emperor adventured to write with more plain dealing than ever <hi>Charles</hi> V. or his other Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors durſt to uſe, highly offended the Pope, cauſing him to return a ſmart Anſwer to it in terms very diſobliging to the Emperour; telling him amongſt other things, that he was very acute in obſerving the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Council; but in the mean time was blind in diſcerning from whence they proceeded; which if well conſidered, were chiefly from himſelf, and from others who inſtead of receiving Laws, were pleaſed to give them, and that had he followed the example of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> thoſe diviſions, and diſcords which appear in the Council would never entered, or would ſpeedily have vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>Howſoever, the Emperor ſtill continuing to oppoſe the Pope, joyned with the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Party, to examine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the arguments which the Papal Faction brought to ſuſtain the clauſe of <hi>Regens Eccleſiam <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalem,</hi> which ſet up the Pope above the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a General Council. So that the Pope perceiving, that there was no hopes of gaining either the Emperor, or the <hi>French</hi> to his ſide, reſolved to joyn himſelf to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who having received the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> were eaſily perſuaded to admit the clauſe, againſt which the others had objected. So that the Pope having his chief ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> party treated the Ambaſſadour of that Nation with a diſtinguiſhing kindneſs, and reſpect; for which reaſon the Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> then Ambaſſadour for <hi>Spain</hi> at the Emperor's Court, wrote to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50681:297"/>
the Secretary of the Embaſſy at <hi>Trent,</hi> as alſo to the Arch-Biſhop, and Biſhop of <hi>Granada, Leon,</hi> and <hi>Segovia,</hi> deſiring them to perſuade the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops to moderate their paſſions againſt the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and convert them into a zeal for the Papal Intereſt; ſo that the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations ſwaying that whole Nation, the Count <hi>d' Avila</hi> who was Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour for <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> became extreamly partial to the Pope's ſide: for when the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> at a Conference with the Pope demanded, that the Cup might be given to the Laiety, and that Prieſts might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to marry, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> oppoſed both; by which Diviſions the Pope gladly made his excuſe to determine neither Point, pretending in that doubtful condition to refer all to the determination of the Council.</p>
               <p>About this time the Cardinal <hi>Seripanda</hi> one of the Legats died, as had not long before his Colleague the Cardinal of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> ſo that for ſome time the Congregation adjourned, until the ſupply of new Legats were come from <hi>Rome,</hi> who were daily expected.</p>
               <p>And now the Pope, who with long delays and general terms had wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out the patience of thoſe, who expreſly contended for a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, began to conſider of the ways, and means, how he might abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throw off the thoughts of it, and handſomly acquit himſelf with the <hi>French</hi> Nation thereupon, He was once inclined, as was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid, to have granted all the Points demanded, which did not intrench upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Authority, and voluntarily have yielded a Licenſe for Prieſts to marry, and to the Laiety the Communion in both kinds: but then conſidering that theſe conceſſions would open a gate to other Demands, and to ſuch a croud of Novelties, which preſſing in at this breach might ruine, and over-run all the conſtitutions, and Canons of the Church; he therefore reſolved to keep himſelf firm to the preſent State of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and Governments, which he doubted not but to maintain, in caſe he could work off the Emperor from the <hi>French</hi> Party; to which end, he ordered the Cardinal of <hi>Moron</hi> who was to ſucceed into the place of one of the deceaſed Legats to paſs from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> there to treat with the Emperor; and repreſenting to him, how fatal ſuch Novelties would be to the Church, endeavour to perſuade him not to inſiſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on thoſe Points, but leaving the <hi>French</hi> to their own Opinions, to take part with the Pope, and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> whoſe friendſhip was more ſtable, and ſecure, than that of <hi>France.</hi> At this time news came to <hi>Trent,</hi> that the King had concluded a Peace at <hi>Orleans</hi> with his Proteſtant Subjects; and it was ſuggeſted at <hi>Rome,</hi> that this Peace was made by contrivance of the <hi>French</hi> Biſhops, who ſecretly, and in their hearts were tainted with Hereſie; at which the Pope was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed, that at a Congregation of Cardinals convened the 31. of <hi>March,</hi> he ordered the Judges of the Court of Inquiſition to proceed againſt ſuch Perſons, as were Inſtrumental in that Peace: and accordingly <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Chatillon,</hi> St. <hi>Romain</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Axi, John de Monlue</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Troye,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> were all accuſed of Hereſie, and cited to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at <hi>Rome</hi> before the Tribunal of the Inquiſition. By theſe Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents the quarrels of <hi>France</hi> encreaſing both at <hi>Trent,,</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi>; the <hi>French</hi> Divines being diſpleaſed both with their ill treatment, and with the long delays in all matters at <hi>Trent,</hi> reſolved to take their leave
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50681:298"/>
of the Council; which the Legats eaſily granted; and to which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours ſo readily aſſented, that they even forced them to retire, by denying to them their Penſions, in caſe they continued in that ſtation againſt the pleaſure of the King; howſoever three Friers who were Penſioners of <hi>Rome</hi> continued ſtill there at the Pope's charge, reſolving to ſee the utmoſt iſſue of all thoſe Affairs.</p>
               <p>The 22. of <hi>April</hi> having been the day formerly appointed for the Seſſion, a general Congregation was held the day before; at which the Legats declaring that matters were not prepared for a Seſſion did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that it might be again deferred until the 3d. of <hi>June</hi> following: to which the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> replyed, that it ſeemed derogatory to the wiſdom, and gravity of that Council, ſo often to appoint times for a Seſſion, and then again to ſubject them to farther delays; wherefore it would be much more adviſable to prefix the 21th. of <hi>May</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the time when a day ſhould preciſely be appointed for holding a Seſſion: This Propoſition ſo generally pleaſed the Council, that with a common Voice they aſſented thereunto; and though this unanimous concurrence with the Cardinal in this matter of ſmall importance admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred ſubject both of jealouſie, and envy to the Legats; yet they could well enough relliſh any thing of delay, in hopes that the moſt violent, and hot ſpirits being wearied with long expectation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would either abate of their mettle, or elſe retire in deſpair or diſcontent.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>Moron</hi> was detained at <hi>Inſpruck</hi> for a longer time than he expected, by reaſon that the Emperor ſuffered all his Papers, and Memorials to be inſpected, and examined by certain of his own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines; which the Cardinal highly reſented as an indignity to the Pope, whoſe Propoſals were more ſacred, than to be expoſed to the cenſures of a few ſilly Prieſts; and indeed it was believed, that this manner of treatment proceeded from the dictates of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> who at that time had diſpatched one of his Gentlemen to the Emperor, deſiring him to ſpeak plainly to the Cardinal <hi>Moron,</hi> giving him to underſtand; that the Council ought to be free, and not to be tranſlated from <hi>Trent</hi> unto any other place, as ſome had contrived out of no good intent to the publick welfare.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Pope was dealing with thoſe Ambaſſadours who reſided with him at <hi>Rome,</hi> to prevail with their Maſters, to refer all Diſputes about Reformation to himſelf, rather than to the Council: for that the abuſes in Diſcipline were never eſteemed the cauſes of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, as plainly appeared in the Primitive Church, where Hereſies were very importunate and troubleſom, notwithſtanding the purity of their Government and the incorruption of their Manners. That it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to extract a Reformation from the common conſent of ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Intereſts, moſt of which being guided by a zeal without prudence, ſerved onely to diſcover the nakedneſs of the Church, and make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to all the World, that her Evils were incurable.</p>
               <p>After a long vacation for ſome weeks a Congregation was held on the 14th. of <hi>May,</hi> when the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> made a long and Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Oration about Biſhops, and the means how to prevent the abuſes in their Election; he firſt began with thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> which was onely an Introduction to his Satyr againſt the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he termed the ſource, and original of all the abuſes, and corruptions in the Church:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50681:298"/>
he inveyed chiefly againſt thoſe Cardinals who held Pluralities of Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks; ſhewing that all the tricks and contrivances for holding ſeveral Benefices <hi>in Commendam,</hi> and the like, were only Artifices to delude that wiſe God, who would neither be mocked nor deceived. Which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe might proceed well enough from the mouth of another; though it became not the Cardinal who was known to poſſeſs a Revenue from the Church of a million of Livers <hi>per annum</hi>; to all which the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Moron</hi> who was newly returned from the Emperor, replyed with great ſharpneſs, nor ſparing the Cardinal himſelf in the leaſt, which ſerved to enflame thoſe Feuds, which had taken their Original from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cauſes.</p>
               <p>And now upon return of Cardinal <hi>Moron</hi> from the Emperor, every one began to diſcourſe of the iſſue, which his Negotiations had produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; on which Subject, the common report was, that the Emperor had promiſed to defend the Authority of the Pope againſt the oppoſition and reſiſtance of Hereticks. That he would not paſs beyond <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> nor conſent to have the Council removed from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Bologna</hi>; nor could he accept the Propoſition of coming to <hi>Bologna,</hi> and there be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hands of the Pope without the advice, and conſent of a Diet. This, as we ſaid, was what appeared above-board, and the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diſcourſe of the Town: but the truth, and the ſecret of it was this, That the Cardinal <hi>Moron</hi> had perſuaded the Emperor, and the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> to conſent to have the Council diſſolved; for in regard the intention and deſign of the Council was really no other, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Church, and the many corruptions in the ſeveral Members of it, and whereas it was apparent by plain experience, that a Council com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſuch different Intereſts, and Members, who were wedded to their own Parties, and their ſelf-conſervation would never endure a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which ſhould impair, or leſſen their condition: which being granted for a certain truth, the continuance of this Council would ſerve onely to multiply trouble, and inflame diſſentions: of which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror being perfectly made ſenſible, conſented to have an end put to the Council: but leſt a ſudden diſſolution of it, ſhould make too great a noiſe, and render it ridiculous, or contemptible to the Proteſtants; it was judged moſt convenient to have the Council die of a Conſumption by ſuffering the Members to retire by degrees, whereby it would come to expire without noiſe, or trouble: and indeed every one growing now ſenſible, of the little fruit, which might be expected from the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Council, were of themſelves inclined to retire; many of them reflecting on the ſaying of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen.</hi> That the troubles of the Church are always augmented by the Aſſemblies of the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Now when the 20th. of <hi>May</hi> was approaching,<note place="margin">1563.</note> which was the day appointed to conſider of a time to be prefixed for the following Seſſion; it was thought fit, at a Congregation held on the 19th. to defer the day for appointing a Seſſion until the 10th. of <hi>June</hi> following, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the ſpirits of Men were ſtill boyling with high fermentation, all Controverſies being ſtill in diſpute, and nothing tended to a concluſion. And in the mean time the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> Ambaſſadour from <hi>Spain,</hi> being to be introduced publickly into the Congregation, gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to revive that antient quarrel about precedency between the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; the which Point being obſtinately maintained by both Parties, various ways, and expedients of Accommodation were
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50681:299"/>
contrived both at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> to ſatisfie and content both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but the <hi>French</hi> who reſolved not to retire the leaſt ſtep back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, declared, that they would keep that ſtation and rank which was due to their place, and rather than recede in the leaſt they would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the Council, and proteſt againſt all the Acts of it. So that the Count <hi>de Luna</hi> found great difficulty in being admitted to a place in the Council; nor could he be received there but at a time, when it was purpoſely contrived that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour ſhould be abſent. At <hi>Rome</hi> alſo the like Diſpute aroſe between the two Ambaſſadours, which thé Pope finding impoſſible to be reconciled with indifferent terms, thought fit at length to ſpeak plainly to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour and tell him, that he was reſolved to maintain the King of <hi>France</hi> in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of Precedency, of which he had ever been poſſeſſed: Hereupon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour deſired liberty to make his Proteſt; which being admitted, and he introduced into the Pope's Chamber with four Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he kneeled down, and having declared that his Maſter juſtly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged the Precedency, as well on the Title of antient Right as from the grandeur of his Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the large extent of his other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; he proceeded farther to magnify the conſtancy of his Maſter to the Catholick Cauſe, which he had with Valour, and ſucceſs defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt all its Enemies, having never condeſcended, as the <hi>French</hi> had lately done to terms prejudicial to the Church, nor diſpenſed with the Articles of Faith with ſuch eaſineſs as they had done by their Treaty with Hereticks at <hi>Orleans.</hi> The Pope being greatly overſwayed with this laſt argument, began to relent of his former Sentence, and gently replyed, That he was ready on all occaſions to ſerve, and favour the Catholick King, and therefore not to appear poſitive in his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he intended to remit the conſideration of this knotty difficulty to the Colledg of Cardinals.</p>
               <p>Thus gently was this matter managed at <hi>Rome</hi>; But at <hi>Trent</hi> it made greater noiſe, and diſturbance; for notwithſtanding the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, and Propoſitions which were made to accommodate, and ſalve the honour of both Nations in this Point, nothing proved effectual; the expedient offered to have a ſeparate place both in the Chappel, and in the Congregation for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, which ſhould neither ſeem above, or beneath the <hi>French:</hi> and that when the Incenſe, and Peace were given at High Maſs, they ſhould be performed at the ſame time by two Cenſors, and two Officials, that ſo neither Ambaſſador could have cauſe to complain, that the other was preferred before him. But this equality, and concurrence was diſpeaſing to the <hi>French,</hi> who would not be contented with indifferent terms which ſhould conſerve the Point undecided; but required that judgment ſhould be clearly given in right of their Precedency; in default of which the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> did not onely threaten to cauſe great diſturbances; but the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours declared their reſolution to make their Proteſt: not (as they ſaid) againſt the Legats who acted according to their Inſtructions, nor againſt the Catholick King, who had reaſon to ſupport and maintain his own Right; nor againſt the Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> who obeyed the Orders of his Maſter; nor yet againſt the Papal Chair to which they bore all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and Obedience, but againſt <hi>Pius</hi> IV. who falſly ſtiled himſelf Pope, having by Simony, and corruption ſubreptitiouſly got himſelf to be Elected, and placed in the Apoſtolical Sea. In proof of which they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:50681:299"/>
produced two Cedules for conſiderable ſums of Money. One of which the Cardinal <hi>Caraffa</hi> had received from the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and aſſiſtance he had given in the Election of the Cardinal of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis</hi>; the which was afterwards ſent by the ſaid <hi>Caraffa</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King; the other Cedule, though not produced, was poſitively alledged to remain in the poſſeſſion of the Cardinal of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſubſcribed by the proper hand-writing of the Pope himſelf. And farther, beſides this high manner of proceeding by Proteſt; the Ambaſſadour <hi>du Ferrier</hi> prepared an eloquent Speech in <hi>Latin,</hi> which was afterwards publiſhed in Print, though not ſpoken in the Council, wherein, after he had proved the right of Precedency to belong to his Maſter, he reproached the Perſon, and conduct of <hi>Pius</hi> IV. for having ſowed the ſeeds of Diſſention, and War between two ſuch great, and powerful Allies; and that having by a criminal Ingratitude forgotten all thoſe Obligations, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Chair owed to <hi>Pepin, Charlemagne,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> his Son Kings of <hi>France,</hi> by whoſe favour it had been exalted to its preſent greatneſs; he did therefore Proteſt, that he would never more acknowledg this Pope for the Vicar of Jeſus Chriſt, nor own the Acts of this Aſſembly as of a General Council, having never been free, but reſtrained wholly to the Dictates of this Pope: And therefore he did in the name of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Order, and command all the Prelats of the <hi>French</hi> Nation to retire unto their reſpective Dioceſes, until ſuch time as a more free, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Council were convened. To this high pitch and degree of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were both Parties tranſported, that no other event, or iſſue thereof was expected, than a ſpeedy and raſh diſſolution of the Council, of which every one growing weary, wiſhed to ſee an end of their fruitleſs labours; but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour remitting ſomething of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer heat, deſired time to acquaint his Maſter with all the preceding paſſages; in which Interval theſe Heats abated, and the Council proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to other matters.</p>
               <p>And now after all theſe Stirs, and Combuſtions, and the many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations which the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> made againſt the Pope, and his complaints againſt the abuſes, and corruptions of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; on a ſudden his humour, and affections changed without any viſible cauſes which might move him thereunto, ſo that now inſtead of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing againſt the Pope, or being the Chief in private Cabals againſt him; he with wonderful addreſs applyed himſelf to the Legats, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the flatteries of Cardinal <hi>Moron</hi> with a pleaſing relliſh, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to hear the Legats tell him, that they deſired to act nothing without his privity, wiſhing that he would bear a ſhare of the burthen with them, being infinitely ſatisfied to have all their Affairs guided by his direction. But this dearneſs between them laſted not long, before the Queen Regent wrote a Letter to the Cardinal, in which ſhe required his ſpeedy return into <hi>France,</hi> where his preſence would be much more ſerviceable to the Crown, than it could be at <hi>Trent,</hi> from whence no good effect either towards Peace, or Reformation could be expected. That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now concluded a Peace with her Proteſtant Subjects, which ſeemed to be well eſtabliſhed, and permanent, there was no farther neceſſity of giving them other ſatisfaction from Acts of the Council, or conceſſions of the Pope; and therefore that for the future he ſhould give Order to the <hi>French</hi> Clergy, not to combat with the Papal Authority, but rather to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50681:300"/>
be concurring in whatſoever might fortifie, and confirm the ſame: To which part and action the Cardinal ſeemed eaſily to incline; in regard that ſtanding on ill terms with the Proteſtants, who were mortal Enemies to the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> he found it neceſſary to ſupport himſelf with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which notwithſtanding all former quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and Piques, he profeſſed himſelf a true Friend and an obedient Servant.</p>
               <p>And now a new Ambaſſadour called <hi>Birague</hi> arrived at <hi>Trent</hi> from the Court of <hi>France</hi> with Letters, rendering an account unto the Council, of the Peace lately concluded with the Proteſtants, for which, and for the Articles granted to them in the free exerciſe of their Religion, there was ſuch a neceſſity, that without ſuch an accord, the Crown, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of <hi>France</hi> would have been expoſed to utmoſt extremity; the which being performed with deſign of reducing the ſtraying, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Sheep into the path, and fold of the Church; it was hoped, that the Council would put a good Interpretation on this tranſaction, and approve of this Cure, and remedy which was unavoidable. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil being doubtful what Anſwer to make unto this Letter, deſired time to conſider thereof, intending to diſpeed it by the Ambaſſadour <hi>Lanſac,</hi> who was preparing for his return into <hi>France; Birague</hi> having in the mean time Commiſſion to paſs unto the Court of the Emperor. And now the Congregation proceeded to examine the Point about Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ordinations; in the diſcuſſing of which, the Biſhops did not ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhere to the matter in hand, but that they made frequent excurſions into the abuſes of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; and thence deſcended to the old controverted Points about the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, and Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, which were never mentioned without Heats and Quarrels. In the treating of which <hi>Lainez</hi> General of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> undertook to give a more home-blow than any had done before him, which he did with ſo much heat, and vehemence, as if the ſalvation of mankind had depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereupon: He took that occaſion alſo to excuſe Diſpenſations, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and Taxes laid by the Church, the Riches of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all thoſe things which are commonly termed Abuſes; thence he proceeded to exalt the Papal Authority above the Council, above all the Church, nay above the Clouds, and higher than we can imagine: the which Diſcourſe, tho diſpleaſing both to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and all but the Penſioners of <hi>Rome,</hi> was highly applauded by the Legats, to whom his long Orations did never ſeem tedious, as if they had choſen him for the Interpreter, and Explainer of all their thoughts and deſigns; to which end, when his turn came to ſpeak he was commanded to take his place in the middle of the Aſſembly, and heard always with patience, and applauſe of the Legats, when the Chiefes of other Orders were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſpeak in their places, and were brow-beaten, and diſcouraged. Howſoever, a certain <hi>Benedictin</hi> Monk offered to confute <hi>Lainez,</hi> and prove that the Poſition maintained by him, namely, That the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the Pope, is the ſame with that of Jeſus Chriſt, was impious, and ſcandalous. But the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> who had now changed his Deſigns, and Intereſts, moderated the zeal, and heats of both Parties; and the Legats laboured to pen ſuch a Determination of that matter, as might by the ſubtilty, and ambiguity of thoſe words ſeem to content all Parties: which Inſtrument though the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> ſeemed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50681:300"/>
to remain ſatisfied, yet the Canoniſts of <hi>Trent,</hi> and Penſioners of <hi>Rome</hi> made a thouſand difficulties, imagining that the words did not ſcrew or ſtrain up the Papal Authority to its true Note, and degree. About this time <hi>Maximilian</hi> who was no great Friend to the Pope, having been lately choſen King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſent his Ambaſſadour to <hi>Rome</hi> to give him notice of his Election; but not in the ſame method which his Predeceſſours had practiſed, who promiſed, and ſwore to whatſoever the Popes impoſed upon them: for before he would paſs that Point, he deſired firſt to know what terms the Pope would require of him; to which anſwer was made by the Cardinals, That he ſhould acknowledg his confirmation to the Pope's Authority, and ſwear Obedience to him in ſuch manner, as his Predeceſſours had formerly practiſed; which though the Ambaſſadour in the name of his Maſter refuſed to do, in ſuch ſtrict ſenſe, as the Pope required, and would onely promiſe Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reverence, and compliance with the Apoſtolical Chair; yet the Pope was pleaſed to accept thereof, and interpret thoſe Expreſſions to be equivalent to the term of Obedeince, and accordingly granted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, which was never demanded, and accepted the Obedience, which was never offered.</p>
               <p>At a Congregation held on the 21th. of <hi>June,</hi> all things were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the Seſſion appointed for the 15th. of <hi>July</hi> following, that nothing might then obſtruct the proceedings, or give occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the time, as had formerly been done to the great diſ-reputation of the Council, and ſcandal of its Enemies. The great difficulties, in the queſtions ſo often diſcuſſed, about Reſidences, and Inſtitution of Biſhops were ſtill undecided; and therefore the great care then incumbent on the Legats was to frame, and pen thoſe Points in ſuch words, as might pleaſe at leaſt the Plurality, or major part of the Congregation, which being tired out, and wearied with the frequent recital of thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Pro,</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> were willing to accept of indifferent terms, or ſuch, as might bear a dubious Interpretation, or ſuch perhaps as contained no ſenſe at all; and others were for having thoſe Articles buried in ſilence; only the <hi>Spaniards</hi> remained unchangeable and unwearied, being ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to their firſt Principles. Howſoever, the Legats were reſolved to exhibit their Decree about Reſidences, in the manner, they had already penned, namely, That all thoſe, who have a Cure of Souls were obliged by the Commandment of God, to have a particular knowledg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with every Member of their Flock; which not being to be performed but by a continuance in the Pariſh, or Dioceſe, it was thence inferred, and interpreted that Reſidences were by Divine Right.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Point about Epiſcopal Inſtitution was concluded in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral terms, that the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of Biſhops was an Ordinance of God. Howſoever theſe terms did not pleaſe the ſubtle, and hot-headed wits of neither ſide. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not think the words plain, and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite enough: and the Biſhop of <hi>Tarante,</hi> and the other Favourers of <hi>Rome,</hi> who were jealous of the leaſt ſhadow of that, which might infringe or abate the Papal Authority, were apprehenſive, that ſuch conſequences might be deduced from thoſe words, as might plainly infer, that the Orders of that <hi>Hierarchy</hi> were rather by Divine, than Papal Inſtitution: but theſe People were more jealous of the Pope's Authority, than the Pope himſelf; for though this very form of words had been debated
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50681:301"/>
above a hundred times at <hi>Rome,</hi> and approved, and propoſed by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, yet theſe Canoniſts, and zealous favourers of <hi>Papirius</hi> were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſticklers againſt and oppoſers of the Decree; howſoever the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly by plurality of Voices paſſed the Decree, and ordered, that they ſhould remain in the ſame form and words delivered.</p>
               <p>In fine, the 15th. of <hi>July</hi> which was the day of the Seſſion being come, which had been ſo often adjourned, and with ſuch impatience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; all the points of Doctrine were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reduced to four Chapters, and eight Canons with <hi>Anathemas.</hi> The firſt eſtabliſhed, that Eccleſiaſtical Ordination is a Sacrament: That under the New Teſtament there is but one viſible Order of Men, which can offer the Sacrifice of the true, and real Body, and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: That there are ſeveral degrees higher, and lower of this Order: That Prieſthood hath a character im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon it; and inſpires with it the Holy Ghoſt. That Unction is neceſſary at the inſtitution of a Prieſt: That the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of Prieſts is by Divine Right: That Biſhops are ſuperiour to Prieſts; That the Biſhops, and Prieſts who are eſtabliſhed by the Pope, or by Authority derived from him, are onely true, and Evangelical in their Orders.</p>
               <p>Then proceeding to the eight Canons which reſpect Reformation; the firſt was that about Reſidence, which had made ſo much noiſe, and diſturbance, the words of which obliged every Paſtor to be acquainted with and to feed his Flock; in explanation of which, this Canon forbad all long abſence from their charge under ſevere penalties; howſoever, that clauſe was moderated with a Diſpenſation for three months, and with a proviſo, unleſs the benefit, and ſervice of the Church, and State ſhould require it. The other Canons had reſpect onely to the collation and regulation of Orders: and that they were not to be conferred upon debauched perſons, or ſuch, as were unworthy of them; and directed the manner, and government of Seminaries, in which Prieſts were educated; with ſeveral other matters of little importance; all which paſſed, and were enacted in the Council without any oppoſition, or diſturbance: though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would never more be reconciled to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> for deſerting their party, in the point of Reſidencies to which he had ſo often promiſed, and aſſured them of his conſtancy; but what he loſt on one ſide, he gained on the other; the Legats, and favourers of <hi>Rome</hi> crying up his wiſdom, and conduct, and true zeal to the Church and the Apoſtolical Sea.</p>
               <p>All <hi>Europe</hi> in the mean time was in great expectation of the iſſue of this Seſſion, which had been preparing for the ſpace of ten months, and with the wit, and contrivance of two or three hundred Prelats, and Divines. At the end of which, nothing could be more ſurprizing to the World, than to find their expectations ſo wholly defeated, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this mighty Machine, or Engine to be ſo inconſiderable as not to have yielded matter ſufficient to have employed the brains of one intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent perſon for the ſpace onely of a ſingle Week: the contradictions which appeared in their Canons, and the weak preambles to all their concluſions were the common talk, and ſubject of ſport and deriſion in all places, and adminiſtred matter and diſcourſe for the Proteſtants to treat, and rally upon in their Sermons; particularly <hi>Vergere</hi> who had once been the Pope's Nuncio in <hi>Germany,</hi> but now become a preaching Miniſter in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> (which is a Country of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> did with
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50681:301"/>
great perſpicuity, and ſtrength of reaſon lay before his Flock the many falſe reaſonings, and vain conteſtations amongſt the Biſhops, and the ſcandalous proceedings of the whole Council; the reports of which with all the particular paſſages he diſpatched to all places, where the moſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Divines, and Preachers of the Proteſtants reſided; for he being a near Neighbour to <hi>Trent,</hi> was in a better capacity to receive true, and conſtant information of all paſſages, than thoſe who reſided at farther diſtances: for which the Pope and the Cardinal <hi>Moron</hi> were ſo offended at him; that they endeavoured by menaces to affright, and drive him to more remote parts: but he reſolved ſtill to continue his Station, notwithſtanding ſeveral attempts, that were made upon his life.</p>
               <p>The Seſſion being in this manner ended, the Legats deſigned to haſten all remaining Points, and contract them in ſuch a compaſs, as might tend towards a ſpeedy end, and concluſion of the Council. The points of Indulgences, Invocation of Saints, Images, and Purgatory were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered all into a bundle requiring no great examination, in regard that being matters which intrenched on the Intereſt of no Party, adminiſtred little cauſe of Diſpute, or oppoſition: onely a Controverſie aroſe about Clandeſtine Marriages, or ſuch, as were contracted without the conſent of Parents, which the <hi>French</hi> would have to be declared in themſelves void, and null, by reaſon of the inconvenience, and ruins which ſuch ſort of Marriages have proved to certain Families in that Kingdom: but herein a difficulty aroſe, for that Marriage which is one of the ſeven Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments being once celebrated, is of force, and not to be again diſſolved, but by Authority and diſpenſation of the Church. After divers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates thereupon, the Biſhop of <hi>Metz</hi> was ſo happy as to find a form of words for that Canon, which contented all Parties, which was this, That though the Church hath ever forbidden, and deteſted Clandeſtine Marriages, yet whoſoever denies Clandeſtine Marriage to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> The marriage of Prieſts admitted now of no farther difficulty; for though the Emperor, the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> demanded that priviledg in behalf of their People, yet that Point was now laid aſide, and all inſtances in that matter were denied to be heard, or admitted to farther queſtion, or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in the Council.</p>
               <p>After this the Legats propoſed thirty eight Articles in order to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which contained the many abuſes, and encroachments which Secular Princes had made upon the Rights of the Church: but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> was for abbreviating the Articles, and for cutting off all thoſe which might adminiſter matter of Controverſie, ſo that by a ſpeedy diſpatch thereof the Council might tend towards a concluſion; which cauſed many to wonder, that the zeal which he had ſo warmly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced at firſt for a Reformation, ſhould ſo ſoon vaniſh and be evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. A Copy of theſe Articles being communicated to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, every one made his obſervations, reflections, and additions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as was moſt conſiſtent with the affairs of their reſpective Maſters; For the chief Remarks and alterations of the Ambaſſadours tended to ſomething which might abate the Power, and Authority of the Pope over the Ordinaries, and the juriſdiction of the Biſhops themſelves over the Civil and Municipal Courts. But the <hi>French</hi> were the moſt ſevere of any in the rules of Reformation. For they would have the number
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50681:302"/>
of Cardinals reſtrained to twenty four; that the Nephews of Popes, during the life of the Pope ſhould not be capable to receive a Cardinals Hat, that Cardinals ſhould be made uncapable to hold Biſhopricks; that criminal cauſes againſt Biſhops ſhould not be judg'd at other Tribunals, than ſuch as are within the Dominions of <hi>France.</hi> That Biſhops ſhould be endued with plenary Power to give abſolution in all Caſes. That Eccleſiaſtical perſons ſhould not be concerned, or intermedle in ſecular Affairs; and in ſhort, that they do no act or thing which may infringe the Law of <hi>France,</hi> or intrench on the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. Theſe particulars for reformation of the Church thus delivered, were to be prepared againſt the next Seſſion, and as reſolved ſo to be enacted; and for Reformation of the Courts of Princes it was by agreement of the Ambaſſadours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as the chief matter, and ſubject for a ſubſequent Seſſion.</p>
               <p>Theſe Propoſals were in no manner acceptable to the Pope who could not endure ſuch fatal attempts on the Power and prerogative of the Church; to avoid which nothing could be a defence, or remedy, but onely the diſſolution of the Council; to which end he earneſtly wrote to all his Nuncios reſiding in the Courts of forein Princes, commanding them to uſe their utmoſt art, and skill to perſuade the reſpective Princes to be aiding, and concurring herein. And farther, gave orders to his Legats at <hi>Trent</hi> to grant freely whatſoever could not be refuſed, and with all decent ſpeed to put a final end and concluſion to the Council: but this Deſign encountred ſome rubs, and obſtructions from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour and others of that Party, who complained of the private Cabals which the Legats held with certain Cardinals, and other Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, in excluſion of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt. But their complaints were little regarded by the Legats, whoſe greateſt incumbence then was, to ſatisfy the Biſhops, without whoſe concurrence the Council could not be diſſolved. For now the intention of the Biſhops being to make uſe of this occaſion to enlarge their Power, and obtain ſome priviledges which were derogatory to the Papal Chair; made that point of gaining the good will of the Biſhops to be the more difficult; becauſe that their pretences of ſubjecting Monaſteries and regulation of Friers, and certain priviledged Churches to the Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, which were exempted from it by Orders of the Pope, found moſt oppoſition from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of the reſpective Orders; and indeed the Ambaſſadours themſelves did not much favour this Demand, which ſeem'd too highly to advance and exalt the pride and power of the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe things were under Debate, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a large Pacquet from their Maſter, in anſwer to the late Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals projected for a Model to reform abuſes in the Courts of Princes: the which much diſpleaſed the King, and his Miniſters of State, who wondered at the daring attempts of the Clergy on the King's Royal Power and Authority under a pretence of Reformation, contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the mean time with a ſlight, and ſuperficial review of their own abuſes: and therefore perſuaded the Fathers of the Council, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto matters purely Spiritual, and to ſuch Acts as might ſerve to reform corruptions crept into the Church, and to correct the debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lives of Prieſts, and Monks, (the ſcandal of which had been the cauſe of all the Schiſm in the Church) rather than to intermedle with the ſacred Prerogative of Kings, or abett, and maintain the Clergy in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50681:302"/>
their oppoſition and contumacy againſt their Sovereign. Thus much the Ambaſſadours had Orders to ſignifie to the Council, with farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, that in caſe they ſhould notwithſtanding this intimation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to encroach on the King's <hi>Regalia,</hi> that then they ſhould make their Proteſt, and retire to <hi>Venice</hi>; all which the Ambaſſadours made known to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and declared to the Legats, requiring the Biſhops to ſuperſede their pretenſions to thoſe honours, and priviledges which were the ſole Right, and Prerogative of Kings. The Biſhops who were reſolutely bent to maintain thoſe Emoluments which ſo nearly concerned them, proteſted before the Legats, that they would neither enter more into the Congregation, nor give their advice, or Voice in any matter, unleſs they were firſt ſecured of the Rights to which they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which a hundred of them obliged themſelves by ſolemn Oath never to remit. All which violent Conteſts took up ſo much time, that when the 15th. of <hi>September</hi> was come which was the day before the Seſſion,<note place="margin">1563.</note> nothing was duly prepared in order to paſs into a Canon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time was prorogued until the 11th. of <hi>November,</hi> that ſo in the interim the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> might have ſufficient time to make his Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was greatly deſired by the Pope, and all that Party.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal being arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> was received with all the joy, and honours imaginable, he was lodged in the Pope's Palace and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in Perſon viſited by him, which was a Complement that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Pope had made before to any under that character of a Cardinal. After which there paſſed ſuch kindneſs between them at ſeveral private Conferences, that the Pope ſeemed to refuſe nothing which might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and oblige the Cardinal, having at his inſtance granted an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Church of three hundred thouſand Livers a year to the King of <hi>France,</hi> which Bene had formerly been demanded, and ſollicited with great importunity, but could never be obtained, until this endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment happened between the Cardinal, and the Pope. For now their mutual intimacy, and friendſhip began to be ſo great, that the Pope opened his boſom and heart to him, giving him to underſtand, that the Council being become a burden to him, which he could not ſupport, he had therefore ſent a private Bull to his Legats either to prorogue, or adjourn it to ſome other place, as ſhould be moſt agreeable to the ſtate of Affairs: but the Cardinal who profeſſed to have the ſame Intereſt, for that his occaſions required his preſence in <hi>France,</hi> yet could not concur in Opinion either to have the Council prorogued, or adjourned to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; but rather to diſpoſe matters in order to a Concluſion, which might eaſily be effected, by laying aſide all thoſe Points which might adminiſter matter, or cauſe of Diſpute; promiſing to contribute to this Deſign all the Power, and Intereſt he had with the Ambaſſadours and Biſhops, that ſo every thing might terminate happily, and to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope being overjoyed with theſe Promiſes, was comforted in the higheſt degree by the conſolatory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Cardinal; in return for which, he promiſed to uſe all his endeavours to create him his Succeſſour, by engaging ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Cardinals in his favour as ſhould ſecure his Election; promiſing in the mean time to make him the chief Inſtrument of all his grand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Thus was the one elevated in his hopes, and expectations of high
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50681:303"/>
preferments; and the other encouraged againſt the refractory oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the <hi>French</hi> Prelats, who were now grown mutinous, and the Papal Authority rendered contemptible to them. For at that time <hi>Chatillion</hi> had voluntarily renounced his character of Cardinal, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf by the title of <hi>Count de Beauvais,</hi> and in contempt of that Dignity, was married in the habit of a Cardinal, as if he intended by that action to have rendered that Honour ridiculous.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Prelats alſo being diſguſted, five of them retired from <hi>Trent,</hi> having eaſily obtained their licenſe from the Legats, whoſe chief endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and labour was now to appeaſe the Sedition, and mutinies of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who were come to that unbridled uſurpation, and entrenchments on the temporal juriſdiction of Princes, and Magiſtrates, that they conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Legats to read in the Congregation, that Model of a Decree which they had projected for Reformation of Secular Magiſtrates; the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of which were ſo licentious, and extravagant, as deſerve to be noted for diſcovery of that Pride which reigned amongſt the Clergy of thoſe days, the contents of which were theſe: That a Clergy-man was not liable to the Sentence of a Secular Court, nor could he be tryed at that Bar, though he himſelf ſhould conſent thereunto, that the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Judges ſhould not intermedle with cauſes relating to Matrimony, to Hereſie, to Tenths, Advowſons, or rights of Patronage, nor with any other cauſes whether civil or criminal, wherein the Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was or might be concerned, That no Injunction be iſſued out of a Secular Court, to hinder the proceedings of the Eccleſiaſtical, in points of Excommunication, though taken out againſt the Emperor himſelf or againſt Kings. Nor ſhall the Civil Law contradict, or interfere with the Eccleſiaſtical in matters which relate to the Affairs, Goods, or poſſeſſions of the Church; which is endued with a Power of conſtituting its own Courts, and Officers of ſeveral degrees, ranks, and qualities. That the Clergy ſhall be exempt from Taxes, Impoſts, Tithes, or Subſidies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. That Princes or Magiſtrates ſhall not have Power to quarter Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Officers, or Horſe within the Houſes, or on the poſſeſſions of the Clergy, with ſeveral other Articles of like tenure, which were ſo repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Power of Kings, that is ſeemed to ſhake their Authority, and ſet up an other Soveraignty within their own Kingdoms indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of the Regal Juriſdiction: for which reaſon the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours having made their Proteſt againſt theſe Articles in the ſpace of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days afterwards, retired from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which they had received from <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The news of this retreat of the Ambaſſadours was very unwelcome to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and eſpecially to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> who apprehended that this unexpected accident would much eclipſe his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and Reputation with the Pope, and defeat the hopes he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of his new preferment; which that he might ſtill keep up, he promiſed the Pope to write and accordingly did write unto the King in ſuch terms, as plainly evidenced, how far he had abandoned the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he brought from <hi>France,</hi> and ſacrificed them to a new aad ſtrange Intereſt which he had acquired at <hi>Rome.</hi> After which the Pope wrote to the Legats to prepare for the following Seſſion according to the time appointed, and to commence immediately after the return of the Cardinal to <hi>Trent</hi>; and then ſpeedily to wind all things up, ſo as to put
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50681:303"/>
a final concluſion to the Council, in which there ſeemed no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, for that the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> being drawn off, they had none to deal with, but onely with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Howſoever the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting highly the retirement of the five <hi>French</hi> Biſhops, accuſed them of Hereſie, and cited them to make their defence before the Tribunal of Inquiſition at <hi>Rome:</hi> in like manner he iſſued out Proceſs againſt <hi>Jane</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> Widow of <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> upon an accuſation of Hereſie, in order to depoſe her from her Crown and Dignity; the which Decrees were divulged, and affixed on all publick places. And though the Cardinal did in diſlike thereof, repreſent unto the Pope, that this manner of proceeding was contrary to the received Maxims of <hi>France,</hi> and the liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and that it was not ſeaſonable to proceed with ſuch rigour againſt a Queen, who was an Ally of <hi>France,</hi> and the Relict of one lately ſlain in Battel againſt the <hi>Hugenots</hi>; and that it was too early to ſummon Biſhops to receive judgment at <hi>Rome,</hi> againſt which the Council of <hi>France</hi> had ſo lately proteſted: yet the Cardinal having performed this Office in a cold, and perfunctory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if he intended rather to acquit himſelf with his Maſter, than gain his Point, gave no ſatisfaction to the Government of <hi>France</hi>; which therefore making uſe of the Ambaſſadour Monſieur <hi>d' Oiſel</hi> in this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation; his endeavours ſucceeded ſo well; that the Proceſs againſt the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the five Biſhops, was ſuperſeded, and the whole matter buried in ſilence: And that the King might ſhew, how little he regarded the Decrees of the Council; he proceeded actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to alienate the Lands of the Church, before the Licenſe and Grant of the Pope arrived his hands, and raiſed thereupon two millions and five hundred thouſand Livres. By this time the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> was returned, and the eleventh of <hi>November</hi> came, which was the day appointed for the Seſſion; after the uſual ceremonies of which were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the Article about Clandeſtine Marriages was read, and after ſome Conteſts thereupon, was paſſed by plurality of Voices: but yet it did not paſs the raillery of ſome witty Men; who reflected on the words of the Canon, which pronounces <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt thoſe, who deny Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Marriage to be a true Sacrament; and yet in the concluſion ſaith, that the Church hath ever diſapproved and deteſted it. Afterwards the Decrees of General Reformation were read, which are too long to be here inſerted, upon paſſing of which, the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> declared, that the <hi>French</hi> Nation did ſo far accept them, as they were not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Priviledges, Rights, and antient Conſtitutions of the Kings of <hi>France.</hi> Howſoever, amongſt all the Chapters of General Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was not one Point of thoſe many touched, which the People of divers Nations required; nothing being therein contained, or reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but what ſerved to advance the Pope's Authority over the Clergy, and warrant the Power of the Clergy in oppreſſion of the People. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe Points of General Reformation, there was one which made void all Titles, or Rights to Benefices which were obtained by Simony, which in the Opinion of ſome, would have ruined the greateſt part of the Pope's Annates, or yearly Income, had it been ſtrictly obſerved: but this was as duly obeyed, as the Canon which prohibits Cardinals to enjoy plurality of benefices; in both which, time, and experience have ſhewn us, how little either the one, or the other hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50681:304"/>
Another Chapter which ordained that thoſe who had publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinned, ſhould do publick Penance, ſeemed, as if it deſigned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Primitive Diſcipline; but that was again ſpoiled by this clauſe, <hi>Ni aliter Epiſcopo videatur,</hi> with theſe, and matters of the like nature, this Seſſion concluded.</p>
               <p>And now the Scene of Affairs began much to change their face; for every one growing weary of Diſputes, paſſed every thing almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out examination, or conteſt. The Pope was infinitely tired, and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the burthen of the Council. The <hi>French</hi> who now expected no benefit from this Aſſembly, followed the dictates of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> who had intirely devoted himſelf to the Papal Intereſt. The <hi>Germans</hi> had long ſince abandoned the Council, deſpairing of any good, or cure from it: onely the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to whom delays have been always pleaſing, and to whom by force of gravity all fatigues of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance are rendered Eaſe, were thoſe, who willingly would have protracted the longer courſe of the Council; but not being able to ſtem the Torrent, with which other Nations precipitated the Council to a concluſion, they yielded to the ſame humour, and concurred with the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and others in their Deſign to put an end to the Council at the next Seſſion.</p>
               <p>The Points about Indulgences, on which <hi>Luther</hi> had grounded his firſt quarrel with the Pope, Adoration of Saints, Purgatory, Images and Faſts, were all ſlubber'd over, and paſſed in the ſpace of fifteen days: The greateſt difficulty was that, which related to the Reformation of Princes, againſt which the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> had ſo ſeriouſly proteſted; which being a knotty, and inſuperable Point, it was reſolved to leave it undecided: and in lieu thereof to perform ſomething for the better ſatisfaction of the Clergy; allowing unto the Biſhops ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of Power over their reſpective Chapters. But as to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree which was drawn up, for reforming, and moderating the Authority of Princes, they thought fit in lieu thereof to renew the tenure of the Antient Canons, not enforcing them with Menaces, or <hi>Anathemas,</hi> but onely with exhortations to Princes, to conſerve, and maintain the Church in its priviledges, concluding with gentle terms full of reſpect to the Sovereign Power.</p>
               <p>The expreſſions of this Article being thus moderated to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (as the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> imagined) of temporal Princes, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſuade the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours to return again from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Trent,</hi> which they abſolutely refuſed to do; for though the Article for reforming Princes' was revoked, yet ſeveral other Acts being paſs'd to the prejudice of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, the Ambaſſadours pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that their return and preſence, would imply or argue a concurrence, or an aſſent to all the Decrees of the Council. Notwithſtanding this refuſal, the Council proceeded forward to conſider of the reformation of Friers, Monks, Abbots, and other Religious; in reſpect to whom, few Rules were altered, onely ſome additions were made, according to the Propoſals and deſires of the Generals of the reſpective Orders.</p>
               <p>All other things (as we have ſaid) proceeded ſmoothly, the Point of Indulgences being ſuperficially touched; for conſidering the many difficulties comprehended in that queſtion, which might, if diſtinctly treated, have taken up a long time in the examination of every Point;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50681:304"/>
it was thought fit to couch all in few words, prohibiting the abuſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in general terms. Thus did matters haſten towards an end, but what did more eagerly precipitate a concluſion, was the Pope's indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of health; for it was feared in caſe the Pope ſhould die du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Seſſion, that then the Council would by the example of that of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> take upon themſelves a Power of electing an other; ſo that notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (who deſired to proceed with gravity, and phlegm, until they could receive an anſwer of what they had wrote to <hi>Madrid</hi>) the ultimate Seſſion was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the 9th. of <hi>December:</hi> but in regard that time ſeemed too long to Perſons impatient of an end, the day was ſhortned to the third of that month, and to be continued on the day following in caſe the Affairs ſeemed too weighty and various to be ended at one ſitting. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour with fourteen of his Biſhops not being able to withſtand this general Torrent, promiſed to concur with the others on theſe two conditions; Firſt, That the Pope ſhould regulate all matters not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by this Council; And ſecondly, That in the Chapters of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, the word (<hi>gratis</hi>) ſhould not be uſed, leſt it ſhould prejudice the Indulgences granted by the <hi>Cruſada</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the difficulties being now overcome, the Seſſion was held on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 3d. of <hi>December,</hi> at which, after the Sermon, and uſual Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, all the Acts prepared according to form were read, but being too long for the work of one day, the remaining part was left until the day following: at the concluſion of all, fearing leſt in any of the Decrees of Reformation, ſome words ſhould have eſcaped, which might ſeem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench, or diminiſh the Pope's Authority; it was determined that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Canons, and the liberty to diſpenſe with any of them ſhould remain in the breaſt, and at the free pleaſure and will of the Pope; in confirmation of which it was publickly declared by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Voice, that the intention of the Council in all, and every of their Canons was to maintain the Papal Dignity in its antient Power, and Authority, without any abatement, or diminution thereof. And final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Act was read, and publiſhed, whereby it was declared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the place, or rank which any Ambaſſadour or Repreſentative had holden, or poſſeſſed in that Council, ſhould give no Title, or ground of claim for the like degree, or place for the future; the Council not pretending to determine any thing in prejudice of the rights and priviledges of Kings, Princes, or States. Laſtly, at the breaking up of the Council, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications and <hi>Anathemas</hi> were read againſt all Hereticks in general, mentioning <hi>Luther, Zuinglius,</hi> or others in particular. And then the period was cloſed with loud acclamations in praiſe of the Pope, the Emperor, the Kings, the Legats, and all the Fathers: which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a different manner to the practice of other Councils, which ended with acclamations, and bleſſings pronounced with the confuſed noiſe, or murmurings of the whole Aſſembly; but at <hi>Trent</hi> it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by way of Reſponſes, or Antiphonas; in which the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> pronounced the firſt Sentence, and was again anſwered by all the Prelats; which being the part of a Deacon, or Chanter, ſeemed an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice too mean to be perſonated by his Eminence, and not onely gave ſubject of railery to the World, but ſubjected him to a thouſand Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures at his return home, where it was charged upon him, that in the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50681:305"/>
Acclamations, or Antiphonas, then made, there was no mention of the King of <hi>France.</hi> And in the laſt place it was ordained, That all the Prelats ſhould ſign the Decrees before their departure upon pain of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; for execution whereof a form of Congregation being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the Hands, or ſubſcriptions conſiſted of four Legats, two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, three Patriarchs, twenty five Arch-Biſhops, two hundred ſixty eight Biſhops, ſeven Abbots, thirty nine Procurators, or Subſtitutes in behalf of ſuch as were abſent, and ſeven Generals of the Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: the ſubſcriptions of the Ambaſſadours were not required, to avoid the late Conteſtations, and Diſputes about place. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this number of Biſhops, there was not one of <hi>Germany</hi> preſent in the laſt Convocation, which was far the moſt numerous, and ſolemn of any: for <hi>Hungary,</hi> or <hi>Poland,</hi> there were very few Biſhops preſent; there appeared not one for <hi>Sweden, Denmark, England,</hi> or the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</hi> The Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> which came onely towards the latter end, being joyned with the Biſhops of <hi>Spain,</hi> could not in all make above the number of forty; ſo that of the two hundred and odd Biſhops of which this Council was compoſed, there was at leaſt one hundred and fifty of them <hi>Italians,</hi> who were Creatures, and Penſioners of the Pope. For which reaſon this Aſſembly was juſtly termed the Council of the Pope, and his <hi>Italians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Council being in this manner broken up every one returned to his home, and Country; and all things being concluded to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Pope, cauſed great joy in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Legats, and the other Favourers thereof were received and welcomed with applauſe, and commendations; and the Pope to gratifie his Friends, who had taken ſuch pains, and ſerved ſo well in this important Affair, promoted nineteen of them to the Dignity of Cardinals, and amongſt the reſt the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Taranto</hi> was in a ſingular manner remembred, and gratified.</p>
               <p>Nor had the Pope ſo much taken up his thoughts with the Council, but that being tranſported with a ſpirit of munificence and Building, he could attend to raiſe, and continue his Name by mighty, and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Structures: and figuring to himſelf a model of the antient <hi>Rome,</hi> as if he intended to have reſtored it to its antique glory, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the antient Monuments to be conſerved, the Streets reſtored, and at his great expence the Aqueducts which brought the Water from diſtant places to the City to be again repaired. It was this Pope who re-built the Baths of <hi>Diocletian</hi> upon Mount <hi>Quirinus,</hi> converting them into a Church, and to a Monaſtery, which he perſonally conſecrated. He fortified the Caſtle of St. <hi>Angelo</hi> and repaired the ruins of the Caſtle of <hi>Civita Vecchia,</hi> and made many other Structures for convenience, and Ornament of the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1564.</note>Whileſt he was intent upon theſe Affairs, a certain number of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains deſigned to have murthered him, and to have perpetrated this wickedneſs at the time, when he was buſied in reading a Paper which they were to conſign into his hand: the Perſon who was to deliver him the Writing was one <hi>Acolti</hi>; and the Contents, or ſubſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was a perſuaſion to reſign up his Papal Authority into the hands of ſuch a Perſon, whom they ſhould deſcribe to him; for they pretended to have received a Revelation, and ſeen a Viſion, that the Succeſſour
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50681:305"/>
to this Pope ſhould be of an Angelical Spirit, elected by the common conſent of all Chriſtendom, that he ſhould become the Univerſal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of all the World, reform the Manners of Mankind, teach them to live up to the perfection of humane Life; and in ſhort, convert all People and Nations to the Chriſtian Faith. <hi>Acolti</hi> having delivered his Paper, and being about to ſtrike the fatal blow, his heart failed him: upon which one of the Aſſaſſinates diſcovering the Conſpiracy, they were all ſeized, and juſtly executed with ſuch torments as the blackneſs of the Crime deſerved.</p>
               <p>Not long after this being on the 10th. of <hi>December,</hi> 1565. the Pope died, having governed five years, eleven months and a half; he had du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his time created forty five Cardinals, ſome out of favour to Princes, and others in reward of their own worth, and merit; and had he lived, his intention was to have made up his number a full hundred, ſo that they might have been called, <hi>Centum Patres.</hi> But he died in the 77th. year of his age, and his body was buried in the Baths of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> lately converted into a Church by him, and called <hi>Sancta Maria Angelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> And the Sea was vacant twenty nine days.</p>

This <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Ghiſler</hi> ſo called by <hi>Papyrius Maſſonius,</hi> but by <hi>Cicarella</hi> named <hi>Michael,</hi> was born of mean and ordinary Parents at a Town called <hi>Boſchi,</hi> not far from <hi>Alexandria della paglia,</hi> which lies between <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the State of <hi>Milan</hi>; he was entered into the Order of <hi>Jacobin</hi> Friers at the age of fourteen years, and then changed his name to <hi>Michael</hi>; he was ordained Prieſt at <hi>Genua,</hi> and proved a moſt ſtrenuous Preacher, and Maſter of a moſt powerful, and moving Eloquence; he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſtituted Prior of his Convent of <hi>Vigevani,</hi> and Commiſſary of the Inquiſition; he was by <hi>Paul</hi> the 4th. made Biſhop of <hi>Nepi,</hi> and then Cardinal <hi>de Sancta Sabina,</hi> but in regard, that he was born at <hi>Boſchi</hi> not above ſix miles diſtant from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he was commonly ſtiled Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Aleſſandrino</hi>; and then as we have ſaid, without much faction, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, he was with common conſent on the 7th. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1566. created Pope.</p>
               <p>All the Writers of his Life, give him the commendation of unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed Virtue, of a ſtrict, and ſevere Devotion, and of a moſt excellent Spirit in the government of the Church; but for a more perfect Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of him take the words of <hi>Papyrius Maſſonius,</hi> which are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>He did neever ſeek, or purſue honours, but walking always in the direct, and even path of Virtue, he was always courted and overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them: the Dignity of Cardinal had changed nothing in his humour, and ſerved onely to render his Virtues more conſpicuous to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50681:306"/>
the World: for he ſtill reſerved the ſame ſweetneſs and affability in his nature, the ſame ſeverity in his life and diſcipline, and the ſame freedom, and candour in his advice and Counſel, as he had maintained in his private condition, having always a more ſtrict regard to Juſtice, and Truth, than to the favour, and flattery of great Perſonages; and in delivering his Advice, as his words were plain, and ſincere, ſo his geſtures, and countenance enforced them with prevailing Authority. Thus was his advancement to the Papal Authority raiſed on the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal of his own merit, ſo that there is no place left for doubt, but that his Election proceeded from Divine Providence, or Inſpiration, rather than from the judgment, or direction of Men: for he had no fumes, or vanities of an antient Family to boaſt of, no grandeur of richneſs, nor favour of Princes, which might aſſiſt, and concur to his Inſtalment, and prepare his way to the Papal Sea; onely the ſame Vertue which had accompanied him from his youth, gave him favour in the eyes of the World, and lead him by the hand to this degree of Sovereignty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the Feſtival of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> being then of the age of ſixty two, he was Crowned Pope but not without the fears, and apprehenſions of the World, who imagined, that his quick, and hot nature being prone to ſudden anger, being conjoyned with that ſeverity of Life which he had always profeſſed, would render him as froward, and impetuous as <hi>Paul</hi> IV. but his teaſty nature which was ſubject to ſudden anger, was as eaſily, and quickly paſt; and then his good nature returning again, he would execute his paſſion, which being free from Pride and Ambition, and worldly conſiderations, did never tranſport him beyond the limits of Decency, and Reaſon. Being now ſeated in the Papal Chair, the Eſtabliſhment, and Ornament whereof he eſteemed to be holineſs of Life in himſelf, and purity, and religious deportment in the Clergy; he endeavoured to put thoſe Rules of Piety into practice, which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> had preſcribed for reformation of Manners, and Diſcipline amongſt Prieſts, and religious Perſons. In order unto which, he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to baniſh all the <hi>Corteſans</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> which was a work of no ſmall adventure at that time, when thoſe Ladies of pleaſure poſſeſſed the moſt ſumptuous, and magnificent Palaces of the City, and were favoured by the Patronage of ſome Senators, and Cardinals, who to hinder that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind action, alledged, that the Church would not onely loſe a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Revenue, which did ariſe from the pains of that induſtrious ſort of People, but alſo Strangers be deprived of thoſe entertainments of Muſick, and Dancing; which they promiſed to themſelves during their reſidences at <hi>Rome:</hi> howſoever, though theſe conſiderations did not wholly avail with the Pope, yet they did moderate the rigour of his Sentence; ſo that ſome of the <hi>Corteſans</hi> were permitted Licenſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and abide in a certain corner of the City being forbidden to paſs through the high, and publick ſtreets, and to frequent any of the Churches, excepting two or three which were appointed for them, where Maſſes were allowed and Sermons preached on Texts proper to their condition, and in order to reduce them to contrition, and converſion of life.</p>
               <p>As he was ſevere in this manner againſt the <hi>Corteſans,</hi> ſo he carried a ſtrict Eye over all the Clergy; enjoyning all ſuch as enjoyed any Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50681:306"/>
from the Church to have the Crown of their head conſtantly ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and never to wear Silk in any of their Habits and Garments, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in their Stoles and Veſtments in which they officiated, or celebrated Maſs; the like modeſty, and grave deportment he ordained amongſt all the Officers of his own Family, where he appointed three Lectures of Divinity to be read every Week for entertainment of the Clergy: and commanded his <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> and Soldiers of his Life-guard to comport themſelves with Civility towards all, without Extortion, or Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>As to his own Relations, he commanded them all to retire from <hi>Rome,</hi> having provided for them in other places with ſmall Penſions; excepting onely one young Nephew, who was a Student in the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> College; and an other called <hi>Michael Bonnello</hi> who being a youth of excellent parts, and a hopeful diſpoſition, was at the great inſtance of Friends promoted to the degree of a Cardinal.</p>
               <p>A certain rich <hi>Jew</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> called <hi>Elias,</hi> one learned in the <hi>Rabbins</hi> and <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, and Maſter of a Synagogue, did uſually frequent the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of this Cardinal <hi>Alexandrino,</hi> before he came to be Pope; between whom queſtions being often controverted about Religion: the Cardinal by the force of Reaſon and the Example of his holy life ſo prevailed at length upon the <hi>Jew,</hi> that he promiſed to become a Chriſtian, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that faith, ſo ſoon, as this Cardinal ſhould be created Pope: the which promiſe <hi>Alexandrino</hi> immediately challenged ſo ſoon as he was promoted to the Papal Chair: the <hi>Jew</hi> was not able to reſiſt or deny the engagement; but believing that this unexpected advancement of his Friend to the Popedom, was an impulſe of the Holy Ghoſt for his converſion, did immediately profeſs the Chriſtian Faith; and together with his Wife, three Children, and a Nephew were all baptized by the Pope himſelf about the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> in the year 1566. And thus much ſhall ſerve for a Character in general of the humour, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of this Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V.</p>
               <p>Now as to the management of his temporal Power; he was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zealous againſt the Proteſtants on the one ſide, and againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> on the other: For as to the firſt he ſent Cardinal <hi>Commendone</hi> to be preſent at a General Diet in <hi>Germany,</hi> convened by the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> and be their aſſiſtant to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, and offer ſuch cautions, and Caveats in their proceedings, as might defend, and ſecure the Papal Authority, as much as was poſſible.</p>
               <p>Then to ſubject and ſubdue the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> he furniſhed King <hi>Charles</hi> IX. with an Army of four thouſand four hundred Foot; and nine hundred Horſe under the command of the Count St. <hi>Fleur:</hi> and farther to ſupply the occaſions of this King with Money, he gave licenſe to ſell, and alienate ſo much of the Church Lands in <hi>France,</hi> as might ſuffice for the carrying on of this War, in which Truſt of Sales the Cardinals of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and <hi>Bourbon,</hi> being made Commiſſioners, the Lands belonging to the Church, which were then ſold amounted to the value of one hundred and fifty thouſand Crowns of yearly Revenue.</p>
               <p>In the next place, it was this Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. who out of his great zeal, excommunicated <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> with all her Subjects of the ſame profeſſion. And in the year 1569. conferred on <hi>Coſmo de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> the Title of Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>; in Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50681:307"/>
for which the Duke coming to <hi>Rome</hi> to acknowledg the honour done him, was there crowned with a Ducal Crown by the hands of the Pope, about the Circle of which this Motto was engraven, <hi>Pius quintus Pont. Max. ob eximiam Dilectionem, ac Catholicae Religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Zelum praecipuumque Juſtitiae ſtudium donavit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then to demonſtrate his zeal againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> the prevailing Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies over Chriſtianity under the conduct of <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, who at that time was entered into <hi>Hungary</hi> with an Army of two hundred thouſand fighting Men: He inſtantly deſired, and exhorted the Chriſtian Princes unto Unity amongſt themſelves, that they might repulſe the common Enemy of the Chriſtian Faith: and to ſhew that he would not perſuade others to that performance, in which he did not readily offer himſelf to be an Example; he freely ſent unto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour a Preſent of ninety thouſand Ducats, with promiſe to furniſh fifty thouſand Crowns more every year, ſo long as the Wars ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</p>
               <p>And indeed at that time there needed Counſel, and Arms, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to reſiſt <hi>Solyman,</hi> who had beſieged the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Segeth,</hi> which was then commanded by Count <hi>Serini,</hi> whoſe Family like that of <hi>Hanibal</hi> againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> had ever ſworn enmity, and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable hatred to the <hi>Turks.</hi> It happened, that though <hi>Solyman</hi> died in the Siege againſt this City, yet the aſſaults, and force were continued by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> who concealed the death of <hi>Solyman,</hi> until he had firſt adviſed the news thereof unto his Succeſſour <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> the Second, during which time, he plied the Town with ſuch continual ſtorms, as reduced the Defendants to the laſt extremity; and to a reſolution of ſelling their Lives at the deareſt rate; which they accordingly performed by a Sally of five hundred Men, in which all of them being ſlain with their Leader Count <hi>Serini,</hi> the Town was ſoon after ſurrendered into the hands of the <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was now the year 1570. when <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> ſucceeding his Father the Great <hi>Solyman,</hi> and being a Prince as ambitious and as deſirous to enlarge his Empire, as was his Predeceſſour, reſolved upon the Conqueſt of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> then belonging to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Dominions. But that he might not ſeem to attempt the Countries of his Neighbour, before he had firſt denounced War; he diſpatched a <hi>Chiaus</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> demanding the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> as a dependance on the City of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and a Member of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Empire, to which he had gained a Title by the power of his Sword. This Meſſage or Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons being delivered in full Senate, was ſeconded by many Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> and great preparations for tranſporting Soldiers into <hi>Cyprus.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> being thus aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the potent Enemy of Chriſtendom, applyed themſelves to the Pope, deſiring him that he would be pleaſed out of his paternal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration to the Chriſtian Cauſe, to adminiſter ſome effectual help from his own hand, and exhort all other Chriſtian Princes to enter into a League, and unite their Forces againſt the common Enemy of the Chriſtian Faith: In compliance with this Requeſt, the Pope prevailed with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to furniſh the <hi>Venetians</hi> with fifty Sail of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys under the Command of <hi>John Andrew d' Oria,</hi> a valiant, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced General, requiring him to obey <hi>Mark Anthony Colonna</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50681:307"/>
in Chief of the Pope's Gallies; and accordingly in the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1570. a very conſiderable Force met at the Rendezvouz in <hi>Candia</hi> conſiſting of one hundred and eighty Gallies, eleven Galeaſſes, and ſix Ships of War. But the <hi>Turks</hi> being more forward in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, had a Month before that time landed a formidable Army in the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi>; where after having taken the Cities of <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> and <hi>Famagoſta</hi> with great effuſion of blood, they made themſelves Maſters of the whole Iſland; whileſt in the mean time the two great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>Colonna</hi> and <hi>D' Oria,</hi> being at variance, for <hi>D' Oria</hi> refuſed to yield to <hi>Colonna,</hi> the deſign was fruſtrated, and the Fleets returned home without any Action conſiderable in that Voyage, which verified the truth of that ſaying of <hi>Livy, Quam plurium imperium bello inutile.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his ill ſucceſs did not diſcourage theſe Allies from making farther trial of their fortune; for being all concerned to reſiſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their League again for the ſucceeding year which was <hi>An.</hi> 1571. And that they might prevent the miſunderſtandings which the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had happened between the two Generals; it was agreed, that <hi>Don John d' Auſtria,</hi> who was natural Brother to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould be Commander, or Generaliſſimo of the whole Navy, that <hi>Mark Anthony Colonna</hi> General of the Pope's Gallies, ſhould be his Lieutenant, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly preparations being made, <hi>Meſſina</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Sicily</hi> was appointed for the place of Rendezvouz, where about the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the whole Fleet joined together, conſiſting of one hundred <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> light Gallies, 6 Galleaſſes, two Ships, beſides Brigantines, Felucas and other ſmaller Veſſels under <hi>Dominico</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Venice.</hi> The Pope's Gallies were twelve, commanded by <hi>Mark Anthony Colonna,</hi> and the Fleet or <hi>Spain</hi> commanded by <hi>Don John d' Auſtria</hi> conſiſted of eighty one Gallies, amongſt which the three Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> were comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and twenty two Sail of Ships. With this Force this mighty Fleet departed from <hi>Meſſina</hi> on the 16th. of <hi>September</hi> 1571. and ſailed to <hi>Corfu</hi> a ſafe Port belonging to the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea: where having advice that the <hi>Turks</hi> Armata, was in the Gulf of <hi>Lepanto</hi>; they weighed Anchor, and ſtood directly for that place, where on the 3d<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>October</hi> they joined Battel with the <hi>Turks,</hi> and gave them that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable overthrow; which hath ever ſince diſabled them from forming any conſiderable Force at Sea againſt the Chriſtians: for in that fight the which continued not above five hours, the moſt formidable Fleet that was ever equipped, or ſet out from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was deſtroyed; for they loſt one hundred and ſeventeen Gallies, eighty Brigantines, or ſmaller Veſſels which were ſunk, or burn'd, or put aſhoar, forty Sail of Gallies, or thereabouts were taken in the purſuit. Of the <hi>Turks</hi> were killed thirty two thouſand Men, amongſt which were many <hi>Baſhaws,</hi> and <hi>Beglerbeges,</hi> and three thouſand five hundred Captives were taken, and fifteen thouſand poor Chriſtians were releaſed, who had been chained to the Oar in the Gallies of the <hi>Turks:</hi> Of the Chriſtians after the fight was ended, upon the numbers wanting in every Veſſel, the account of the ſlain amounted to ſeven thouſand ſix hundred fifty ſix. This ſignal Victory was attributed as much to the devout Prayers, and Benediction of the Pope, as to the valour of the Soldiers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Captains: the report of which as it filled all <hi>Europe</hi> with joy, ſo it made way for the glories of <hi>Don John,</hi> who was received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <hi>Meſſina</hi> with all the Triumphs, and Feſtivals which that City could expreſs; alſo <hi>Antonio Colonna</hi> was with the like honour, and triumph re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at <hi>Rome.</hi> Nor did the <hi>Venetian</hi> General want ſuch encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and honours, as that Republick commonly beſtows in reward of Valour and Merit; In memory of which ſignal Victory, they ſtamped divers Medals with this Inſcription, <hi>Anno Magnae Navalis Victoriae Dei gratiâ contra Turcas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This memorable Victory was obtained in the time of this <hi>Pius</hi> V. who was certainly one of the beſt of the Popes, and therefore I know not why we may not ſay without offence to any; that this happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs might be given in reward of the Devotion, and Piety of this Pope; for I am perſuaded that God hath a particular care of godly Kings, and Princes, for whoſe ſake as he often bleſſeth their people, ſo he beſtows ſome memorable bleſſings on them of ſignal Remark in their Reign. On which perſuaſion, I am apt to believe, that as God beſtowed this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory on the Chriſtians in the time of this <hi>Pius</hi> V. againſt that great <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> II. So now in theſe our days, he hath given Victory, and unexpected ſucceſs to the Chriſtians before the Walls of <hi>Vienna</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Mahomet</hi> IV. in reward of the great Piety, and Devotion of <hi>Leopold</hi> the Emperour, whoſe Devotion, and Prayers joyned to the Arms of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and of other Princes have operated Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and delivered <hi>Germany</hi> in a wonderful manner from the power of the <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet notwithſtanding the religious temper of this Pope, we find that he excommunicated Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as far as his Bull would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate he depoſed her from Royal Dignities, and conferred her Crown on <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>; and perſuaded <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to ſeize on the effects of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and other parts of the Low-Countries, and to aſſiſt the Catholick Subjects in <hi>England</hi> in their godly,<note place="margin">

               <p>This Pope added alſo to his other Excellencies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Virtue of loving wife, and learned Men, and ſuch as were endued with a vivacity, and acuteneſs of parts; for he ſcarce preferred any to conſiderable Dignity, but ſuch as were excellent in ſome degree or other; and of the twenty one Cardinals which he created at three ſeveral times, there were five of them at leaſt who were Men of extraordinary Abilities, and famous in their Generation.</p>
               <p>He founded certain publick places for Learning, and Piety, amongſt which he endowed a College in the Univerſity of <hi>Pavia,</hi> for the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Youth, and affixed over it the Arms of the <hi>Ghiſlers</hi>; at <hi>Boſchi</hi> the place of his Birth, he built a Monaſtery for <hi>Dominican</hi> Friers, and endowed it with a competent Revenue; and to demonſtrate his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to his Antient Benefactors, he created a Magnificent Sepulcre in memory of <hi>Paul</hi> V. by whom he was created Cardinal: and in ſhort

he made many new Buildings, and repaired ſeveral that were decayed in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and both within, and without the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all which about the middle of <hi>March</hi> 1572. he became indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed by a ſtoppage of Urin, of which he commonly had a fit in that Month; the which illneſs encreaſing upon him gave him notice, that his end approached, from which time converting all his thoughts to holy, and pious meditations, he ſpent the ſhort remainder of his time in the preparation of his Soul for death, which happened on the firſt of <hi>May</hi> following; the ſame day he died, his Body was embowel'd, and three little ſtones found at the neck of his bladder, which the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans declared to be the cauſe of his death.</p>
               <p>He was generally lamented by all, and eſpecially by vertuous Men for conſidering his principles, his Enemies had nothing worſe to object, than that he gave a Diſpenſation to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> to marry with the Daughter of his Siſter and of <hi>Maximilian</hi> his near Kinſman, and yet would never be induced to conſent unto the Marriage of <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois</hi> Siſter of the King of <hi>France,</hi> with <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> making the difference of Religion a greater bar to Marriage, than the degrees of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity forbidden by the Levitical Law.</p>
               <p>The day after his death his Body being clothed in the habit of a <hi>Jacobin</hi> was carried into the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> where the people aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in great numbers to render him Honour, and Veneration, every one touching their Beads, and Roſaries at his Body in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as was their practice at the Reliques of Saints; and afterwards he was honourably buried in the ſame Church; where his Body lay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, until afterwards <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. in grateful remembrance of the benefits he had received from him, tranſported it to the Church of <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> and erected a ſtately Monument over it in a Chappel built for that purpoſe with this Epitaph inſcribed upon it.</p>

It being now about the 7th. of <hi>October,</hi> that the Winds were high, the Rains falling in great abundance, and the Seas unſafe for Gallies; and no hopes appearing, that the Enemy would be drawn to an Engagement; it was reſolved to conclude the Deſigns of

this year; And ſo the Chriſtian Fleet ſailing to the <hi>Weſtward, Don John</hi> and <hi>Colonna</hi> directed their courſe to <hi>Meſſina</hi> and <hi>Foſcarini</hi> to <hi>Corfu.</hi> When the ſucceſs of this year was told the Pope, his Anſwer was; That it was well it was no worſe, for if the firſt year of his Reign had been celebrated with the like glory, as was the former; his beginning would have been too happy, and auſpitious. Therefore that the enſuing year might prove more fortunate, he intended to make it his chief employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Winter, to offer his Prayers, and ſupplications to God with faſting, Maſſes, and Proceſſions, that he would be pleaſed to favour, and aſſiſt the Cauſe, and Arms of the Chriſtians againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Croſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But whilſt the Pope was meditating of theſe things, and contriving means to proſecute the War with moſt advantage; the <hi>Venetians</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly about the beginning of the year 1573. clapt up a Peace with the <hi>Turks</hi> by the mediation of their <hi>Bailo,</hi> who then with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had treated the Conditions with good ſucceſs; to which <hi>Sultan Selim</hi> the more readily inclined; for having done right to his honour by the Conqueſt of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and by taking ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fortreſſes in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> he more eaſily condeſcended to terms of Peace without diminution, or diſparagement as was ſuppoſed to the greatneſs of his Power. But both the Pope and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not ſatisfied with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for having without their conſent and privity, and contrary to the Articles of their League made this Peace with the <hi>Turk:</hi> In excuſe for which the <hi>Venetians</hi> diſpatched their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours to the Pope and King of <hi>Spain,</hi> giving them to underſtand, that the extream urgency of their Affairs, which by many circumſtances were rendered difficult had forced them to an Accommodation with the <hi>Turk</hi>; and in like terms they expreſſed themſelves to Cardinal <hi>Buon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compagno</hi> the Pope's Nephew, whom <hi>Gregory</hi> had in the year 1574. ſent unto <hi>Venice</hi> to complement <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who by the death of <hi>Charles</hi> IX. was returning by that way into <hi>France,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>In this manner the Pope being eaſed of his expenſive War againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> converted the current of his Treaſure to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Henry</hi> III. againſt his Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>France:</hi> for ſupply of which, he raiſed the ſum of four hundred thouſand Crowns by Impoſitions, which he laid on Cities belonging to the Church; and confirmed the Bull given by <hi>Pius</hi> V. for ſale of Church-Lands; of which there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining as yet to the value of fifty thouſand Crowns of yearly Rent, unſold: he conſtituted the Cardinals of <hi>Bourbon, Guiſe,</hi> and <hi>Lewis d' E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But the Pope at the requeſt and upon the applications made by <hi>Senarega,</hi> diſpatched a Letter to <hi>Don John,</hi> exhorting him to deſiſt from his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which was ſo diſpleaſing to him, that in caſe he perſiſted therein, he was reſolved to raiſe all the force of <hi>Italy</hi> to oppoſe his Enterpriſe; the which Menaces having given a ſtop to the proceedings of <hi>Don John</hi>; ſeveral perſons were ſubſtituted Arbitrators in theſe differences by the Pope, the Emperor, and the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; namely, Cardinal <hi>Morone, Caſtacciaro, Borgia,</hi> and <hi>Idiaquez</hi>; who taking the ſtate of the whole matter into their conſideration, rectified, and reformed many antient Statutes, eſtabliſhed new in their places, and ſo governed all things with that even hand, that an accord was made and concluded in the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1576. with that ſatisfaction to both Parties, that the Citizens, and Inhabitants who had retired from <hi>Genoua</hi> for fear of the civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions, returned again to enjoy their repoſe and eaſe according to their accuſtomed Liberty.</p>
               <p>Nor was the Pope leſs concerned for the Peace of <hi>Poland,</hi> where great differences aroſe amongſt the Nobility (as hath been accuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) about the election of a King. For <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France,</hi> having (as we have ſaid) reſigned his Elective Government to take poſſeſſion of his hereditary Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>; the Election of a new King ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred great cauſe of diſpute, and argument; by reaſon of the many powerful Princes which ſtood in competition, and were Candidates for the Election; as namely the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> II. and <hi>Erneſt</hi> his Son, with his Brother the Arch Duke of <hi>Auſtria, Stephen Battori</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania, Alphonſo</hi> II.

in favour of <hi>Anne</hi> Daughter of the Royal Family of <hi>Jagellona</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> intending in right of her to confer in Marriage the Crown upon <hi>Battori</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania:</hi> but theſe diſſentions were ſoon after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by the death of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor; <hi>Battori</hi> being after his Marriage with <hi>Anne</hi> by general conſent of all the Nobles received, and crowned King of <hi>Poland</hi>; and thereupon ſent his Ambaſſadours to <hi>Rome</hi> to pay his reſpects, and obedience to the Papal Chair.</p>
               <p>In the year 1576. a grievous Peſtilence afflicted moſt parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Trent, Milan,</hi> and <hi>Venice:</hi> it is recorded of Cardinal <hi>Borromeo</hi> who was Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> that he was in a moſt pious manner charitable to the Poor, and others of his City at that time of common Calamity, to whom he not onely contributed a maintenance for their food, and Medicines for their ſickneſs, but in perſon viſited ſuch as were afflicted with the Peſtilence, and adminiſtred to them the Sacraments of the Church and other ſpiritual comforts; for which and other works of like piety he was afterwards canonized for a Saint. Nor was <hi>Venice</hi> leſs afflicted with this ſpreading Contagion, of which moſt of the Friers, and other Religious, whoſe duty it was to viſit the ſick, died of the ſame Diſeaſe; for which reaſon the Pope ſent his Indulgences into the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned places, that all ſuch who died with a ſorrow for their ſins, ſhould obtain the ſame pardon, as if they had confeſſed, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and received the other Sacraments of the Church required for dying perſons.</p>
               <p>It will not be very pertinent to this Hiſtory to relate the Troubles which happened in <hi>Portugal</hi> in the days of this Pope; which in reality were very great, cauſed by the raſhneſs of <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> King of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; who ſuffering himſelf to be perſuaded by <hi>Mahomet</hi> King of the <hi>Moors,</hi> who was expelled his Kingdom, tranſported an Army of thirty thouſand Men into <hi>Africa,</hi> to reſtore again the expelled King to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. But as this Deſign was commenced againſt the Opinion, and counſel of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the other Friends of King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>; ſo accordingly the ſucceſs was unfortunate, for his whole Army was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated near the City of <hi>Alquivir,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1578.</note> and himſelf ſlain in the year 1578. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> dying in this manner without Iſſue, Cardinal <hi>Henriquez</hi> Uncle to the deceaſed, and Son of King <hi>Emanuel</hi> was Crowned King; but he being at that time Aged and infirm, and unfit for Matrimony convened an Aſſembly of eleven Barons of the Land, to conſider of a Succeſſour, that ſo future Conteſts, and civil Wars for the Crown might, if poſſible, be avoided. Whilſt this matter was under conſideration the Cardinal King died, and then all things were in confuſion; the Commonalty cryed up for <hi>Don Antonio</hi> who was the baſtard Son of <hi>Don Alvize</hi> Brother to the Cardinal; but the Nobility declared for King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom the right of ſucceſſion to the Crown did legally appertain according to the Opinion of all the Doctors of the Civil Law, this Controverſie came at length to be decided by the Sword, in which King <hi>Philip</hi> having the advantage, ſent an Army of thirty thouſand Men under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> into <hi>Portugal,</hi> where having taken ſeveral Towns, at length made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Lisbon</hi>; where <hi>Philip</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter arriving was acknowledged King, and Fealty paid him by all the Nobles, and Commonalty of the Land; and having remained ſome ſhort time at <hi>Lisbon</hi> returned in peace to his Court at <hi>Madrid.</hi> Whilſt theſe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50681:311"/>
things were in action the Pope ſent Cardinal <hi>Riario</hi> to accommodate dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and moderate between both Parties; but coming too late, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Controverſie was decided, he changed his Office of Mediation to Complements, and joy for the ſucceſſes of the Conquerour.</p>
               <p>About this time Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> confirmed the Excommunication which <hi>Pius</hi> V. had publiſhed againſt <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England</hi>; and outed <hi>Gilbert Truckheſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cologna</hi> of his Arch-Biſhoprick, for marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for adhering to the Confeſſion of <hi>Augsbourg:</hi> He alſo rectified the Kalendar, which we call the <hi>New Stile</hi> or <hi>Gregorian Account,</hi> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten days from that which we uſe in <hi>England,</hi> called the <hi>Julian Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:</hi> the which was to commence in all places where they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in the year 1583.</p>
               <p>About this time alſo there happened an irreconcileable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Grand Maſter of <hi>Malta</hi> and the chief Knights of that Order; which aroſe to that degree and height, that the Knights depoſed their Maſter, put him into Priſon, and having accuſed him of many enormous Crimes, they created <hi>Marturin Romagaſſo</hi> a <hi>Gaſcon</hi> to ſucceed him in his place. On the other ſide the Grand Maſter appealed to the Pope, and complaining of the many injuries he had ſuſteined, deſired that he might be removed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and his cauſe heard before the Apoſtolical Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal. The Pope highly reſenting this inſolence, and indignity which the Knights had exerciſed towards their Maſter, diſpatched his Legat to <hi>Malta,</hi> who by virtue of a Writ from the Pope, brought the Grand Maſter to <hi>Rome</hi>; and with him came three hundred Knights on three Gallies; where being arrived, the Pope favoured the Cauſe of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and in evidence thereof, ſent eight hundred Horſe to meet him, which with great pomp, and triumph conducted him to the Palace of Cardinal <hi>d' Eſte,</hi> where he was lodged with much honour. After a few days allotted for his refreſhment he was admitted to Audience with the Pope, and having in humble manner kiſſed his feet, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated the Hymn of <hi>Nunc dimittis,,</hi> or, <hi>Lord letteſt thou now thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant depart in peace, for mine eyes have ſeen thy Salvation.</hi> Which piece of flattery ſo pleaſed the Pope, that he would give no credence to the Calumnies, and charge of his Accuſers, but diſmiſſed his Cauſe, and returned him back to his Lodging with honour, and entire ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. After which <hi>Romagaſſo</hi> his Rival coming to <hi>Rome</hi> to hear, and ſee how matters were carried; and finding himſelf diſcountenanced both by the Clergy and by the Princes, conceived ſo ſad a reſentment of this miſcarriage, that falling ſick with grief, he ſoon after departed this life about the beginning of <hi>November</hi> 1581. Two Months after which the Grand Maſter being alſo tranſported with a different paſſion died at <hi>Rome</hi>; both which accidents ſo happily concurring obviated all the difficulties which might offer about a new Election, <hi>Hugh de Verdal</hi> a <hi>Gaſcon</hi> being choſen by common conſent without trouble, or other tumult.</p>
               <p>The year 1583. began with two unfortunate Calamities which much afflicted the Pope, and the City of <hi>Rome:</hi> the firſt was Famine, and want of Bread-corn which ſo miſerably pinched the poor, for the ſpace of two Months, that many of them were ſtarved to death. The other was a ſad, and doleful Tragedy which began at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ended at <hi>Padoua</hi>; the cauſe and matter thereof in ſhort was this. The Head
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50681:312"/>
Bayliff of <hi>Rome</hi> with his Followers, underſtanding that a certain Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dito was come for a Spy to <hi>Rome,</hi> and for Sanctuary was fled to the Palace of the <hi>Orſini</hi>; by one means, or other he ſeized, and brought him from that place; but it happened that as he was carrying him from thence, <hi>Raimond, Orſini, Savillo,</hi> and <hi>Ruſtici</hi> being on Horſe-back with their Servants unhappily met the Bayliff, and commanded him to releaſe the Priſoner, who was illegally ſeized within the priviledges of the <hi>Orſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni.</hi> The Bayliff refuſing ſo to do, <hi>Ruſtici</hi> ſtrook him over the Head with his Cane, which ſo incenſed the Bayliff that he commanded his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to revenge this affront with their Arms; which they readily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying immediately ſhot <hi>Ruſtici</hi> dead from his Horſe; and ſo mortally hurt <hi>Orſini,</hi> and <hi>Savello,</hi> that in two days after they died of their wounds. This unhappy accident troubled all <hi>Rome,</hi> but eſpecially incenſed the party, and Creatures of <hi>Orſini</hi> to that degree, that riſing in a tumult, they ran with Weapons in their hands to kill all the <hi>Sbiri</hi> or Bayliffs they could find, and having way-laid all the Avenues, where they could make an eſcape, the confuſion continued for the ſpace of two days, and rendered the City a ſad ſpectacle of blood, and maſſacre. In the mean time the Pope, and civil Government not being able to apply a Remedy gave way to the fury of the people, which (as it was believed) would have been inflamed higher by oppoſition of the civil Magiſtrate; The Head bayliff having hidden himſelf for ſome days was at length taken, and beheaded at <hi>Rome.</hi> But this evil ended not here: for from this fatal accident, another quarrel aroſe between <hi>Vitelli</hi> who was Deputy to <hi>Buoncompagno</hi> General of the Church and <hi>Lodwick Orſino</hi> Brother of <hi>Raimond,</hi> who was lately killed; in proſecution of which, <hi>Orſino</hi> taking with him ſeveral perſons in diſguiſe, and Masks, aſſaulted <hi>Vitelli</hi> in his way from <hi>Monte Magnopoli</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſhot him dead with a Carbine in his Coach, for which offence <hi>Orſino</hi> being condemned to baniſhment, he departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> and went to live at <hi>Padoua,</hi> where having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up his Lodgings, he ſoon after committed a like murther on <hi>Vitto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> the Wife of <hi>Paul Giordano,</hi> and her Brother; for which Crime being proſecuted by the Juſtice of <hi>Venice,</hi> he fortified himſelf within his Houſe, reſolving to preſerve himſelf by force of Arms; but not being long able to hold out againſt the Soldiers which were ſent againſt it, the Houſe was almoſt levelled to the ground, and the Defendants taken Priſoners, which being all puniſhed by death, or other Sentences of Juſtice, this fatal Tragedy was at length ended.</p>
               <p>After theſe ſorrowful Stories, the Pope being willing to cheer and comfort the City, created nineteen Cardinals, amongſt which his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew was made one with the title of St. <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and <hi>John Anthony Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chineſti</hi> of <hi>Bologna,</hi> who was afterwards made Pope by the name of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> IX.

               <p>Nor were theſe favours ill beſtowed on the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who had always been ſo induſtrious, and true Drudges to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they brought Proſelytes from the moſt remote parts of the World; and in the year 1585. after a long Navigation of three years, conducted four Ambaſſadours to <hi>Rome</hi> from the Iſland of <hi>Japan</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> ſent from ſome great Lords, and from the Community of Chriſtians convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Country to the Faith of the Goſpel. The arrival of ſuch Strangers at <hi>Rome</hi> filled all the City with Diſcourſe, and Novelty; and were entertained with free treatment at the expence of the Church, being lodged in the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> College, who were the Authors, or Apoſtles of their converſion: though ſome years afterwards by the indiſcreet management of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who uſurped too much on the civil Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and temporal Power of that Kingdom, Chriſtianity was totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated by the moſt cruel perſecution that the moſt fierce Enemies to the Goſpel of Chriſt had ever exerciſed againſt his People: for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars whereof which are moſt doleful, and Tragical to relate, and not pertinent to this Hiſtory, we ſhall refer the Reader to the Writers of the Deſcription of <hi>Japan.</hi> But as to theſe four Ambaſſadours who were all young Men, not much exceeding the age of twenty years, they had remained but few days in <hi>Rome</hi> before Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> departed this life. He was rather ſurprized with death, than reduced thereunto by long ſickneſs, his indiſpoſition being diſcovered by his countenance, before he was really ſenſible thereof within himſelf; his Diſtemper was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Phyſitians to be a Quinſy with which he was ſuffocated, and died the tenth day of <hi>April</hi> 1585. being aged eighty three years, and three months.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50681:313"/>
impertinent adherence to his own Opinion. When at any time he had been reviled, as once he was in the Conſiſtory, where one of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals called him, the Aſs of <hi>la Marca,</hi> he laughed, and took it for a jeſt, and as an effect of that intimacy, and familiarity which was between them. In ſhort, his plauſible carriage made him acceptable to all and opened a way to his Election, which happened the 24th. day of <hi>April,</hi> the Sea having been vacant fourteen days onely.</p>
               <p>This Pope was named <hi>Felix</hi> or <hi>Felice</hi> born of poor, and obſcure Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents at <hi>Montalto</hi> in the Marches of <hi>Ancona:</hi> at the age of fourteen years he took the habit of St. <hi>Francis</hi> and became a <hi>Cordelior</hi> Frier, in a Convent at <hi>Aſcoli</hi> not far diſtant from the place of his birth. As he grew forward in years, he became a good proficient in his Studies, and ſo ſubtil a Diſputant, that he was always challenging and provoking his fellow Students to Diſputations, which moved them to that anger, and envy againſt him, as made them often to fly into paſſions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile him with the meanneſs of his birth, terming him with the reproach of being the Son of a Hog-driver, or the Boy of a Swineherd; all which he took very mildly, and without diſpleaſure to be accounted of mean Parentage; for he would often in jeſt, ſay, that he was born of an Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Houſe which was ſo conſpicuous, that the very Sun-beams darted through it. But when he had paſſed from his Sophiſtry to more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Learning; he took his Degree of Doctor of Divinity in the City of <hi>Fermo</hi>; and ſoon after in company with certain other learned Fathers he went to a publick Diſputation held at <hi>Aſciti,</hi> where in preſence of Cardinal <hi>Carpi,</hi> who was then Protectour of the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Order, he ſhewed ſo much ſubtlety, and acuteneſs of Wit in defending certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, that he acquired the eſteem both of a learned Diſputant and an elegant Oratour. In the year 1551. he was ordained Preacher, at <hi>Siena,</hi> and the year following at <hi>Camerino</hi>; and afterwards by order of his General he was appointed one of the <hi>Lent</hi> Preachers, in the Church of the Holy Apoſtles at <hi>Rome,</hi> and therein acquitted himſelf with great honour and applauſe. Afterwards he was made one of the Council of the Inquiſition, and conſtituted by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. Vicar General of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and together with Cardinal <hi>Buon-compagno</hi> made Legat Apoſtolical in <hi>Italy. Pius</hi> V. created him Biſhop of St. <hi>Agatha,</hi> and Cardinal with title of St. <hi>Jerome:</hi> And laſtly (as we have ſaid) he was on the 11th. of <hi>April</hi> 1585. choſen Pope, giving himſelf the name of <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. though deſired by others to aſſume the name of <hi>Nicholas</hi> in honour to <hi>Nicholas</hi> IV. whoſe memory he was obſerved much to affect, as appears by a ſtately Monument, which he at his own charge, when Cardinal, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected over the Sepulcre of that Pope in the Church of <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore</hi> at <hi>Rome:</hi> But the name of <hi>Sixtus</hi> prevailed with him, both in Complement to Cardinal St. <hi>Sixtus,</hi> as alſo in honour to the memory of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. who was a Frier likewiſe of the ſame Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtus</hi> being thus Elected, he contrived to be crowned on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the firſt of <hi>May</hi>; which day had often proved auſpicious to him; for on a <hi>Wedneſday</hi> he was firſt initiated into the habit of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and on a <hi>Wedneſday</hi> he was created Vicar General, Cardinal, and Pope; on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> following he went to St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Lateran</hi> (according to uſual cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom) to take poſſeſſion of his ſublime Office. But before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the particular Affairs which occurred in his Government;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50681:314"/>
it may not be unpleaſant to the Reader to recite ſome delightful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages which happened upon his Election. For when the Scrutiny was paſt and that <hi>Montalto</hi> thought himſelf ſecure of his Election, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately began to caſt off his diſguiſe of Humility, with which he had for above fifteen years cloaked his Ambition: for no ſooner were half the Votes recited in his favour, by which he found himſelf ſecure of his Election; but being impatient to enjoy the honours of the Papal Throne; he aroſe on his Feet, before the Scrutiny was wholly finiſhed, and placing himſelf in the middle of the Hall; he threw away his little Staff, which he uſually carried for a ſupport of his crooked old Age, and then ſtrut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſtretching himſelf bolt upright, he ſeemed a foot higher than before, that all wondered to ſee the Pope grown in a moment ſo much taller, than when he was Cardinal: and with that he began to hum, and ſpit with as much force as any young Man of thirty years of Age and of ſound Lungs was able to do. At which the Cardinals looking one upon the other, wondred at this ſtrange Metamorphoſis ſhewing ſome kind of diſſatisfaction at their Choice; and therewith the Cardinal Deacon cryed aloud, Hold, fair and ſoftly, here is an Errour in the Votes, the Scrutiny is not good. But <hi>Montalto</hi> would by no means be ſo put off, but boldly replyed, It is good, it is good, and began to ſing <hi>Te Deum Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus,</hi> with ſuch a clear and Audible Voice, that he made the whole Hall ring again; though an hour or two before, he did not ſpeak a word without Coughing, or ſpitting three or four times.</p>
               <p>And therewith placing himſelf before the Altar, with his Eyes on a Crucifix, he ſaid a ſhort mental Prayer, as was accuſtomary; and then the Maſter of the Ceremonies asked him, Whether he was pleaſed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Papal Office? At which turning about with a Majeſtick, and grave Countenance; he replyed: We are not now to receive that which we have already accepted; but if you had another Popedom to confer, we were capable alſo to receive that, for by the Grace of God, we are well aſſured, that we have force, and vigour ſufficient to Rule, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern two Worlds with as much facility, as we can do this one Popedom.</p>
               <p>When the Maſters of the Ceremonies veſted him in his Pontifical Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, they obſerve;d with what marvellous vigour he extended his Arms, to cloth himſelf with his Robes, which he performed with ſuch haſte and agility, as if he feared to loſe his Office, and honour, by appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlow and unactive, which Cardinal <hi>Ruſticucci</hi> attentively obſerving, ſaid to him, Moſt Holy Father, the Papal Dignity is a moſt admirable Medicine, for it turns old Cardinals into young Men, and ſickly and unfirm Perſons, it makes ſound, and robuſtious; To which the Pope replyed, That it was very true, for he found it ſo by good experience. But what was moſt remarkable in this Pope was, that no ſooner was the Scrutiny paſt, than immediately the Scene was changed with him; for he was now no longer the humble, modeſt, and infirm Cardinal <hi>Montalto,</hi> but the haughty, Majeſtick, and grave Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi>; he was now no longer familiar, and jocular with the Cardinals, but ſevere, and moroſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to maintain an eaſie converſation with any, nay even with thoſe who had promoted him to the Papal Dignity.</p>
               <p>Being thus habited in his Pontificalibus, and conducted to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, where was a great concourſe of People from all parts of the City to behold the new Pope; and being come to the <hi>Portico,</hi> he was met by

the Canons of that Church ſinging that <hi>Antiphona. Ecce Sacerdos Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, qui in diebus ſuis placuit Deo, &amp; inventus eſt Juſtus</hi>; which is, Behold the High Prieſt, who in his days, was pleaſing unto God, and was found juſt. As he paſſed forward into the Church, he went ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Croſſes, and ſcattering his Benedictions on the People, with ſuch firmneſs of Hand, and ſtrength of Arm; that they all wondered at the change, and as if they could not give credit to their Eyes, they cryed aloud, which is the Pope? which is the Pope? Others alſo running to one, and other, ſaid, is this the Cardinal, who the other day was ſo feeble and decrepit, that he ſeemed ready to fall at every ſtep? is this he, who walked always ſtooping, with his Head hanging down, and awry to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one ſhoulder, but how is he now changed! with what vigour and Majeſty doth he now walk like another <hi>Aaron!</hi> It is reported, when his Phyſitians came to pay him their reſpects and adoration, as he ſat in his Throne in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, that one of them ſhould ſay to him, Your Holineſs ſeems to have another garb, and meen, than when you were Cardinal: to which the Pope replyed; 'Tis true indeed, for when we were Cardinal, we went always ſtooping, and poring on the ground, to find the Keys of Heaven gate; but now having found them, we need not to look ſo low, but rather caſt our Eyes aloft towards Heaven; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving need of no other matter now upon Earth.</p>
               <p>The Ceremonies in S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s being over, he was conducted by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals to the uſual Lodgings of the Pope, where having left him alone, he refreſhed himſelf onely with a little Bisket, paſſing the whole day with great abſtinence: and being alone, his Servants obſerved him to walk in his Chamber quick and faſt, but in a thinking and penſive manner, at which they much wondered; becauſe they never knew him before to move from his Chair, to walk in that manner; and being in this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly motion, the Steward of his Houſe came to him, (as uſually) to know what he was pleaſed to order for his Supper; whereunto the Pope replyed, with his Eyes fixed on him, and with a ſtern countenance.
<q>It is not accuſtomary to demand of great Princes what it is that they are pleaſed to eat; but prepare us ſuch a Supper as is Royal, and then we ſhall chooſe that Diſh, which is moſt agreeable to our Palate.</q>
Then he commanded, that the Cardinals <hi>Aleſſandrino, Medici, Ruſticucci, Eſte, San-Siſto</hi> and <hi>Altemps,</hi> ſhould be invited with him to Supper: which being accepted by them, they all appeared, except onely <hi>Eſte,</hi> who for ſome reaſons excuſed himſelf; and being ſat down at the Table, the Pope began a Diſcourſe of the great honour which was due to the Papal Dignity; and of the high favour which Chriſt had beſtowed on the Pope in making him his ſupreme Vicar on Earth, repeating often thoſe words, <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock will I build my Church.</hi> And then with vehemence of Speech, he proceeded: O ſaid he, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found are the Judgments of God: Chriſt would not ordain on Earth more than one <hi>Peter,</hi> one high Prieſt, one Vicar, one Head; To one ſingle Perſon onely, he gave Authority to govern his Flock, and to feed his Sheep. <hi>Tu es Petrus.</hi> Thou, Thou onely art High Prieſt: <hi>To thee will I give the Keys of Heaven,</hi> To thee onely do I give the Keys to open, and ſhut, and to bind and looſe. To thee, to Thee onely do I give Authority to ſuſtain, and govern my Flock: to Thee only who art my Vicar, and not to others, who are Servants, and ſimple Miniſters of thine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:50681:315"/>The Cardinals had all this while wit enough to underſtand, that this whole Diſcourſe was levelled onely at them, and at the beginning to take them off of all expectation of governing, or managing Affairs for him. For he was willing to eradicate that Opinion out of their minds, which they had conceived of him; that being a weak, and an infirm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he would eaſily have ſubmitted to the management and direction of his Cardinals; which was true enough, and which doubtleſs was the chief motive at his Election. And to evidence farther his reſolution to rule alone, he would ſcarce ſuffer any of them to interpoſe a word, but he would take them ſhort; and ſtill repeat that ſaying, <hi>That in the Church there ought to be but one Commander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this ſatisfaction the Cardinals after Supper returned to their own Lodgings, diſcourſing as they went of the Complement the Pope had paſſed on them, and of the manner how he had unfolded his mind and thoughts; but above all, Cardinal <hi>Medici</hi> ſeemed to be moſt concerned, having had the faireſt game in all appearance at the Election; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not contain himſelf from ſaying: I ſee a great ſtorm coming towards us, but who is to be ſaved, ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>The day following, or ſome ſhort time afterwards, the Pope called before him the Governour of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Judges of civil and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Cauſes, to whom he recommended with great fervour and zeal of ſpirit an impartial, and ſevere Adminiſtration of Juſtice, but uttered his words with ſuch vehemence of ſpeech, that they ſeemed rather like Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces, than gentle Exhortations, concluding at their diſmiſſion with theſe words: <hi>Non veni pacem mittere, ſed gladium,</hi> I came not to bring Peace into the World, but a Sword.</p>
               <p>The reception he gave to Ambaſſadours and forein Miniſters as alſo to Princes, and great Lords of <hi>Rome,</hi> was with a cheerful Aſpect, and Countenance; but their Audience was but ſhort, excuſing himſelf, that the firſt days of his Pontificate were taken up with ſo much ſolid buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he had not leiſure to beſtow much time on ſuperficial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements. Howſoever he ſhewed himſelf more benign, and obliging to the Ambaſſadours from <hi>Japon,</hi> who (as we have ſaid) arrived in the latter days of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> late deceaſed; and to whom <hi>Sixtus</hi> was very ambitious to ſhew the glory of his Coronation, which being now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring with great pomp and magnificence, he was deſirous to have the report of his State and Grandeur extend to the remote confines of the World.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Sixtus</hi> being ſeated in his Chair, he was affected with the ſame deſire, which commonly poſſeſſed the mind of Popes, of ſhewing his greatneſs, and glory to his near Relations; in compliance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, he gave orders for conducting his Siſter <hi>Camilla</hi> with her Sons to <hi>Rome,</hi> warning them beforehand, that they ſhould content themſelves with that ſober modeſty which became the meanneſs of their birth, and the gravity of thoſe who were related to the Papal Chair, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but decency, and awful reverence did reſide. But ſo ſoon as news came, that the Lady <hi>Camilla</hi> was near the City, the Cardinals <hi>Medici, Eſte,</hi> and <hi>Aleſſandrino,</hi> intending to oblige the Pope, went forth to meet her, and having detained her at a Palace near adjoyning, until ſhe was dreſſed in the habit of a Princeſs, they afterwards conducted her to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Pope expected her with great impatience: but being preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50681:315"/>
before him in that garb and habit, by Cardinal <hi>Aleſſandrino</hi>; the Pope would not ſeem to know her, ſaying, where is my Siſter? Behold her, quoth the Cardinal, Moſt Holy Father here before you. No, replyed the Pope, this cannot be ſhe; for I have but one Siſter and ſhe a poor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Woman living in a Cottage; but this wherewith you preſent me here, is a Princeſs of <hi>Rome:</hi> when I ſee her, in ſuch a homely, and Country habit, as I left her in, I ſhall then own her, and ackowledg her for my Siſter.</p>
               <p>The next day <hi>Camilla</hi> returned to him again in her own ſimple, and Country habit, accompanied onely with her Daughter, and the two Sons from that Daughter; and then when he ſaw her he tenderly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her, and ſaid, This indeed is my Siſter, we now acknowledg you in this habit; and none ſhall make you a Princeſs but my ſelf; for his humour was to be obliged by none, nor would he have his Cardinals to boaſt and glory in a report of having clothed, and adorned his Siſter, and ſetting her up in the garb and ſtate of a Princeſs.</p>
               <p>The firſt of <hi>May</hi> was now come, which was the day appointed for his Coronation, which was performed with all the ſolemnity and pomp that could be contrived. After which he proclaimed that publick Prayers ſhould be made, that God would be pleaſed to illuminate his Vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent here on Earth with Grace and Wiſdom ſufficient to govern the vaſt extent of his Univerſal Church, granting to ſuch as were devout Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants in his behalf Indulgences, and Pardons in a moſt ample manner. Which being performed, he armed his mind with ſuch conſtancy, and reſolution in the adminiſtration of Juſtice, as ſeemed to ſurpaſs the uſual ſeverity of former Popes; and for the firſt Aſſay, and proof thereof, he cauſed four Men to be hanged, for carrying prohibited Arms, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the great Interceſſions, and Intereſt which particular Friends made in their behalf. The which piece of Juſtice was moſt ſeaſonable in thoſe days, conſidering the inſolence of the <hi>Banditi,</hi> or baniſhed Men, who in the late times of <hi>Gregory,</hi> did ſo infeſt all parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the City, nor Country could ſecure the Eſtates or Lives of honeſt Men from their rapine and violence.</p>
               <p>Nor was he rigorous onely in his own proceedings, but required the like ſeverity in all the Officers and Miniſters of Juſtice, that acted under him: ſo that if he obſerved any of his Judges either remiſs in their duty, gentle, or inclinable to mercy, or moderation in what the Law inflicted; he would preſently diſcharge them from their Office, and place others more ſevere, and moroſe; and in caſe he obſerved any of a Saturnine, tetrical aſpect; he would preſently enquire after him, and having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any tolerable character of his condition, he would eſteem him a Man ſit for his turn, and prefer him before a mild and gentle temper, which he thought very diſagreeable to the conſtitution of Magiſtracy.</p>
               <p>As to his Politicks, he thought Intelligence to be the life of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore would have Spies over every Cardinal to watch his moſt private actions; that nothing was either ſaid at his Table, or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered in his Bed-chamber, but what was reported to the Pope. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed alſo Spies over the Princes and Barons of <hi>Rome</hi>; and over the Prelats of the Court who obſerved their actions, and remarked their Diſcourſes: others alſo crept into Shops, and inſinuated themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the vulgar at publick Meetings; others had a Station allotted in
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50681:316"/>
the Monaſteries, that the very Secrets of the Cells were diſcovered: the like courſe was taken in all Towns and Cities of <hi>Italy</hi>; and with ſuch ſecrecy was every thing managed, that one Spy was not acquainted with the walks, nor buſineſs of the other. To all the Nuntios, and Inter-Nuntios reſiding in the Courts of forein Princes, it was ever an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the moſt warmly recommended of any, to be diligent in their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; and not to content themſelves with the common reports of the Town; but to penetrate into the ſecrets, and Cabinets of Princes; to which end, no Mony was ſpared which might corrupt the chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and Secretaries of Councils.</p>
               <p>He ordained certain Viſitors to review all criminal Caſes, which for the ſpace of ten years paſt, had been recorded in any Court within the Eccleſiaſtical State, with power to reverſe the ſame, and proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Offender, in caſe the Sentence upon due examination ſhould be found remiſs, or moderated below that rigour which the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: In proſecution of which, many who were already dead were mulct, or fined in the Patrimony they had left; others who for the ſpace of four or five years paſt had been releaſed from Priſon, either by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Friends, or by Bribery, or by other indirect means, were remanded back again, until the extream rigour of the Law was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
               <p>He farther iſſued out Warrants of diſcovery of all Thefts and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries committed; charging the people upon pain of Excommunication to reveal, and inform every matter of bribery, corruption, or misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which they knew, or of which they could accuſe their Judges, who had for the ſpace of five or ſix years ſat in the Seat of Judicature. By theſe means every day one poor Judg or other, who perhaps alſo was out of employment, was dragged away to Priſon, and cloſe ſhut up for what Crime he knew not, or perhaps had forgot the Sentence he had paſſed in the Caſe, for which he was accuſed. Theſe and many ſuch like caſes of ſeverity ſtrook ſuch a terrour into the minds of thoſe who ſat on the Tribunals of Juſtice, or managed any publick employment; that every one became cautious, and nice in the Sentences he gave, or how, by fear, or bribery he remitted the leaſt ſcruple, or ſeverity which the Law enjoyned, or required.</p>
               <p>Farther, he gave ſtrict charge to all Sindics and Governours of Towns, and Caſtles, to give in, a particular Liſt, or account of all Felons within their reſpective Precincts, who had for the ſpace of ten years paſt been accuſed, or branded with Capital Crimes; and alſo of all ſuch, who had been convicted for ſcandalous, and infamous perſons, and Incorrigible du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of their Sindicate; In which Liſts he required ſuch an exact impartiality; that upon Information given againſt the <hi>Sindic</hi> of <hi>Albano,</hi> how in the Liſt of the Diſſolute and Incorrigible, he had omitted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the name of his Nephew; he was ſentenced by the Pope himſelf to undergo the Strapado in the publick Market-place, from which puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all the Interceſſion, and Prayers, and Intereſt which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour could make in his behalf, was not able to deliver him. By theſe means the Liſts of Diſſolute Perſons which were immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the hand of the Pope, were ſo very exact, that no perſon was exempted, who was guilty of the leaſt Crime. Which when the Pope ſaw, and obſerved every Week, as they were ſent him, he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:50681:316"/>
pleaſed, and eſpecially with thoſe which were filled with a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of names; for in reading of them, he would often ſay, Oh happy Gallies, which I intend to build: O happy I, who have firſt found Men for my Gallies, before I found Gallies for my Men. The which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the Pope, (from whom there could never be any expectation of Pardon) ſo terrified all ſorts, and conditions of People; that every one comported himſelf with the greateſt modeſty, and gravity imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that an Oath, or a rude, or uncivil word was not heard through any of the ſtreets of <hi>Rome:</hi> but every one being alarm'd, and dreading, as if he had always a Conſtable, or a Purſuivant at his back, walked with his beads in his hand, repeating a Pater-Noſter, or ſome other Prayer, with a ſorrowful and penitential countenance.</p>
               <p>By theſe Methods all the <hi>Banditi,</hi> who being grown licentious under the gentle Government of other Popes, and who ſpoiled and deſtroyed all <hi>Italy,</hi> were now by the Juſtice of this Pope almoſt wholly extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for ſuch as fled out of the State of the Church to the Dominions of other Princes, he ſo proſecuted, by laying Fines on any who ſecured, or ſuccoured them, and ſetting a price on the head of every conſiderable <hi>Bandito</hi>; that in a ſhort time he reduced them to a ſmall number, and totally ſuppreſſed the pride and inſolence of that peſt of mankind. And thus reſolutely was <hi>Sixtus</hi> bent to puniſh the Enormities of wicked Men; that whereas it had been the cuſtom of former Popes to ſhew acts of mercy and pardon on the day of their Coronation, opening the Priſon Gates, and enlarging the Priſoners; this <hi>Sixtus</hi> abſolutely refuſed to grant releaſement to any, though inſtantly urged by the Cardinals; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, That there were Rogues ſufficient about the ſtreets, without ranſacking the Priſons for them: That he had taken a reſolution, when he was firſt made Pope, to chaſtiſe the wicked, and not ſuffer their Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies to corrupt, and intermix with the Vertues of good Men. By theſe ſeverities all people lived in quiet and peace one with the other: no Sword was drawn in the City, nor quarelſom words, or uncivil lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage uttered: it being a common ſaying to Men at variance together, Remember theſe are the times of <hi>Sixtus.</hi> Thus when the <hi>Banditi</hi> were ſuppreſſed, the good and benefit was ſo great to all <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Rome</hi> erected a Statue of Braſs to the memory of this <hi>Rome,</hi> on which theſe words were engraven.</p>

               </q>
               <p>And farther, to demonſtrate the inflexible humour of this Pope; it is obſervable, that a poor Youth of about ſeventeen years of age, making a reſiſtance againſt the Bayliffs, who came to diſtrain an Aſs, for ſome Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties owing, and by Law ordained to be paid; in which ſeizure though the Officers made a miſtake, for that the Aſs did not belong to the party who owed the Mony; yet becauſe he offended againſt the courſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, by making oppoſition to it, he was condemned to die; nor could the perſuaſions or Interceſſions of the G. Duke's Ambaſſadour, nor of the Cardinal of <hi>Medici</hi> prevail in his behalf, or mitigate the rigour of the Sentence: and when the Governour of <hi>Rome</hi> alledged that the youth
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:50681:317"/>
being under age could not by Law be put to death for this Crime: the Pope replyed, If he want years, I will lend him ten of mine.</p>
               <p>Nor did <hi>Sixtus</hi> exerciſe this ſeverity onely towards his own People; but he was brisk, and haughty towards all Chriſtian Princes, for in a few days after his Coronation, or at moſt in two months after, he quarrelled with <hi>Henry</hi> III. King of <hi>France,</hi> with <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and with <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain.</hi> The occaſion of his quarrel with <hi>Spain</hi> ſeemed to have had no other cauſe or foundation, than his own pride, and deſire of uſurpation, and which happened in this manner. It had been the cuſtom ever ſince the time of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> V. for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by his Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> to preſent yearly on the 29th. day of <hi>June,</hi> which is the Feſtival of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> a white Horſe, with a Purſe of ſeven thouſand Ducats in Gold to the Pope, for a Tribute, and acknowledgment for the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which that King holds, as feudatary to the Eccleſiaſtical State: And now on the uſual day <hi>Sixtus</hi> appearing on a Throne with pomp, and mignificence to receive his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, which the Ambaſſadour in a quaint Speech, and with fine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements preſented: he ſeemed not very well ſatisfied therewith, but returned this tart, and Satyrical Reply: You think now, ſaid he, that you have made a fine Speech, and indeed ſo you have, for you have made us change a Kingdom for a Beaſt; and ſtill ſeeming uneaſie, as he was about to riſe; he added theſe ſuſpitious words: But we believe, that this buſineſs will not proceed long in this manner. Theſe words immediately touched the Ambaſſadour to the quick; and giving him juſt cauſe of reflection thereupon, he diſpatched them for <hi>Spain</hi> by the firſt Poſt, and to the Duke of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> then Vice-King of <hi>Naples</hi>; the which adminiſtred not onely cauſe of jealouſie, and incited the Vice-King to be watchful againſt the leaſt commotions; but was the cauſe of miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and ill correſpondence between <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the quarrel which he had with the <hi>French</hi> King was of another nature, and grounded on more ſubſtantial differences: and conſidering the fierce reſolution of <hi>Sixtus</hi> might have produced more prejudicial conſequences. The Diſpute had its beginning from a Meſſage ſent by the Pope to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, ſignifying to him by break of day in the morning; that it was the Pope's pleaſure, that in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſpace of two days time he ſhould depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> and from the juriſdiction of the Eccleſiaſtical State: the occaſion of this intimation was this. The Pope for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, had recalled from the Court of <hi>France</hi> his Nuntio the Biſhop of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> with intention to diſpeed <hi>Fabio Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Nazaret</hi> to reſide in his place; for he being a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of prudence, and noted for his admirable conduct, and dexterity in the management of Affairs, the Pope took an extraordinary liking to him, eſpecially for having managed the Office of Nuntio at other times with great ſucceſs: but the <hi>French</hi> King ſo ſoon as he received Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that this Arch-biſhop of <hi>Nazaret</hi> was coming Nuntio to <hi>Paris,</hi> and underſtood by his Character, that he was a Perſon zealous, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted to the Intereſt of the Pope; he immediately diſpatched an Expreſs to him with Letters, deſiring him, that whereſoever thoſe Letters ſhould be delivered to his hands, he ſhould remain, and abide, until new Orders ſhould come to the Pope, whom he had inſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that the Biſhop of <hi>Bergamo</hi> might ſtill continue in his Office. The
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:50681:317"/>
Arch-biſhop of <hi>Nazaret</hi> being proceeded as far as <hi>Lions,</hi> when he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King's Orders, ſeemed greatly ſurprized with this unexpected interruption; ſaying, that his Maſter the Pope, who was impatient of Injuries, would highly reſent an Affront of this nature; and that whereas he had Inſtructions to return back from what place ſoever, he found the leaſt difficulty, or interruption in his Journey; he was reſolved the next day to ſet his face towards <hi>Rome</hi>; the which would produce an ill correſpondence with <hi>France</hi>; for the Biſhop of <hi>Bergamo</hi> would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be recalled, and the Kingdom left without the reſidence of a Nuntio.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as this News was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope reſented it in a fierce manner, and with high words againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, threatned revenge with Thunderbolts of Excommunication, and other Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Cenſures: and in the heat of this fury without the conſultation of a Conſiſtory, he ſent immediately to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour to depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> and out of the Dominion of the Church. On the other ſide when this news arrived at the <hi>French</hi> Court, the King expreſſed his reſentments thereof to his Council, and calling together all the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of forein Princes, he in their preſence, ſtated the difference in the caſe between himſelf and the Pope, proteſting againſt the Injuries he had received. In fine, after ſeveral Letters which paſſed by Expreſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the Pope, without any good underſtanding on either ſide, for the Pope was reſolved not to yield his Point; at length by the mediation of forein Ambaſſadours at <hi>Paris,</hi> and the interpoſition of Cardinal <hi>d' Eſte,</hi> and other Cardinals at <hi>Rome</hi> the matter was accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, ſo that the King received the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Nazaret</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Pope recalled the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour the <hi>Sieur St. Godart</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> whom in his fury he had lately diſpeeded from thence.</p>
               <p>But ſuch quarrels as theſe, were like the fallings out of Friends, which are eaſily reconcileable; and of ſmall importance in reſpect of thoſe grand Feuds which were commenced between the Pope, and <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Navarre</hi> on the ſcore of Religion: for in regard, that in the Reign of <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. a League was made againſt the Proteſtant Religion, and directed againſt the Perſon of the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi>; which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to ſubſcribe: but now this <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. who was of a towring Spirit, and one, who delighted out of the pride of his heart, to mortifie Princes, and contend with great Perſonages, not onely ſubſcribed to the League in a moſt ſolemn manner; but with terrible maledictions iſſued out his Bulls of Excommunication againſt the perſon of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> declaring them guilty of Hereſie, and to be the chief Fomenters and Protectors of the heretical party: and that conſequently the ſaid <hi>Henry,</hi> his Heirs, and all deſcended from him was by the juſt Cenſures of the Canonical Law rendered uncapable to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the right of any Principality, and particularly to the Crown of <hi>France</hi>; and accordingly he did abſolve all his Subjects from their Oath of Allegiance, and the Obedience they had ſworn to him.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe Menaces of the Pope, and the power of the League, <hi>Henry</hi> comported himſelf with that Courage, and generoſity of mind; that the Pope could not but much admire the heroick ſpirit of that King, and conceived ſuch an extraordinary Opinion of his Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and worth, that he would frequently ſay, that there were onely
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:50681:318"/>
two Princes in the World, namely the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe friendſhip, and correſpondence he would court and deſire; but that the guilt of Hereſie had rendered them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of his Acquaintance. And in ſuch eſteem thoſe two were with him, (notwithſtanding the prejudice he had to them, for the cauſe of Religion,) that in his ordinary Diſcourſe he would uſe this ſaying: That to make things go well in the World, there was need onely of three Perſons, <hi>viz. Elizabeth, Henry,</hi> and <hi>Sixtus.</hi> It is ſaid alſo that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> conceived ſuch an eſteem for this Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> that ſhe would often commend his Talent, and excellent Qualities for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that when ſome would diſcourſe of her Marrying; ſhe would often ſay, that if ſhe did marry ſhe would have no other Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, than Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi>; which being reported to him again, he replyed thereupon, That if they two ſhould lie one night together, they ſhould beget an other <hi>Alexander</hi> for the World.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> in the time of this <hi>Sixtus</hi> was Vice King of <hi>Naples,</hi> a Perſon eſteemed the wiſeſt Governour, and the beſt Politician of his Age; and yet was highly blamed by this Pope, for not revenging the murther of <hi>Starace,</hi> who in a popular Inſurrection was aſſaſſinated by the people, for no other reaſon, than that he was eſteemed a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and a Creature of <hi>Oſſuna:</hi> upon which neglect, and default the Pope entertaining Diſcourſes frequently with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, would often ſay, That two Inſtruments were neceſſary for the people, that is, Bread and cold Iron, repeating thoſe words often, Bread I ſay and cold Iron. But <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> who had no need of thoſe Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not long after, (or ſo ſoon as it was convenient) revenged the blood of his Friend <hi>Starace</hi> in ſuch a ſignal manner; that the Pope chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Note, and began to applaud him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe Commotions happened at <hi>Naples</hi> ſome few days after <hi>Sixtus</hi> was elected Pope; and before he was ſcarce warm in his Chair: for had he been well ſetled therein, it may reaſonably be collected from ſome ſayings of his; that he would rather have nouriſhed, and ſomented thoſe broils, then inſtigated the Vice-King to puniſh the Authors of them: for having always had an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to convert the feud of that Kingdom into an actual poſſeſſion, he would have made uſe of thoſe late diſturbances, to inflame the minds of the people and exaſperate them againſt the Government, as a means to introduce his own Authority into the place thereof; and ſo much may be collected from his words one day to Cardinal <hi>Ruſticucci</hi> when diſcourſing of the death of <hi>Starace.</hi> This Man, ſaid he, might have done us great Service, had he lived at leaſt one year longer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtus</hi> all this time would not ſuffer, or endure any Counſellour to adviſe or direct him in his Affairs, but affected to manage all by his own wiſdom and conduct: howſoever he was deſirous of Confidents, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Acquaintance, with whom he might diſcourſe matters, and uſe for Spies to inform him of all paſſages in the World: amongſt this ſort of Creatures, his Nephew Cardinal <hi>Montalto</hi> poſſeſſed a conſiderable ſhare of his affection; for though he was but a young Man, yet he was of a mature judgment, and for his years well practiſed in the Affairs of the World: howſoever he gave him this caution, that he ſhould beware how the kindneſs he had for him, did encourage him to a confidence
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:50681:318"/>
of making any requeſt for Benefits, or favours either for himſelf, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: the like Admonition he gave alſo to his Siſter, and his other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, whom he tenderly loved, and laboured to make rich; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forbidding them, to ask any thing of him: For, ſaid he, <hi>I charge you, never to make any motion to me in behalf of any; for we reſolve to do all our ſelves; and conſider, that what bribes ſoever you take, are but unlawful, and ill-gotten goods; but what Money you receive from us, will be hallowed, and bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this ſeverity, and moroſe humour of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> he would ſometimes divertiſe himſelf with more pleaſant and delightful entertainments; amongſt which he took a particular contentment to read a Book of Memoirs, or recital of ſeveral paſſages, which in the time, when he was a young Frier, he had wrote for his own remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; the which being now Pope, he was much pleaſed to read, and contemplate. One whereof was, That being at <hi>Macerata,</hi> he had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to buy a pair of ſhooes, for which the Shoo-maker demanded ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Giulios or three ſhillings and ſix pence <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Frier <hi>Montalto</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to get them cheaper, offered him three ſhillings, and aſſured him, that ſome time or other he would bring him the other ſix pence: Yes, ſaid the Shoo-maker, and when? when you are Pope, I warrant you. Yes, ſaid he, ſtay but till then, and I promiſe to pay you the Money with full Intereſt until that time. The Shoo-maker laughing, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the ſhooes, and ſaid, ſince I find you diſpoſed to accept the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, be ſure you remember to pay this Debt, when you are exalted to that Dignity. <hi>Sixtus,</hi> as I ſay, reading this paſſage in his Book; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately wrote to <hi>Macerata,</hi> to know if this Shoo-maker were living; which when he underſtood, he ordered the Governour of the place to ſend him up by one of his Officers. The poor Shoo-maker ſurprized, and affrighted with the news, that the Pope deſired to ſee him in <hi>Rome,</hi> for he neither remembred any thing either of the ſhooes, or of the Giulio, it being a matter of forty years ſtanding; ſo that at every ſtep he made, he was ſtill thinking, and wondring at theſe Summons, recalling to mind all the ſins he had committed in his life, conſidering for which of them he was thither cited. Being come to <hi>Rome,</hi> and introduced to the Pope's preſence; He asked him, whether he remembred ever to have ſeen him at <hi>Macerata?</hi> the poor Shoo-maker trembling, told him, No. Nor do you remember ever to have ſold me a pair of ſhooes? No, ſaid the poor Fellow ſhrinking up his ſhoulders: but, ſaid the Pope, we well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that we are your Debtor, and have ſent for you to pay you your Money; for we owe you a <hi>Giulio</hi> on account of a pair of ſhooes, which we are now to pay you with Intereſt according to agreement: and ſo calling for the Steward of his Houſe to pay him the <hi>Giulio,</hi> with the Intereſt upon it for forty years which amounted to two <hi>Giulios</hi> more, he then diſmiſſed the Shoo-maker, bidding him go in peace. The Shoo-maker having received his three <hi>Giulios</hi>; murmured, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained very much, that the Pope ſhould ſend for him, and bring h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The news of the Shoo-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's laments being brought to the Pope by his Spies; he preſently
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50681:319"/>
ſent for him again, and demanded of him, if he had a Son? the Shoo-maker anſwering, yes, and that he was an honeſt good Prieſt of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Servi</hi>; whereupon the Pope cauſed him to be called to <hi>Rome,</hi> and before the departure of his Father, inveſted him in a ſmall Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick within the Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> and then bid the Shoo-maker make up his Account, and ſee, to what ſum the Intereſt of his <hi>Giulio</hi> had amounted. Many are the ſtories of this nature recounted of this Pope, which we ſhall omit, contenting our ſelves to have given the Reader this familiar Tale, which ſeems too light, and frivolous for Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory: yet ſince it is our end, and deſign to give a Character of the Popes; their humour, and diſpoſition, may ſome times be more clearly ſhewn by familiar paſſages, than by the more profound tranſactions of buſineſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who formerly were in high eſteem with <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. and influenced his Counſels in ſuch manner, as that he acted nothing but by their pleaſure, and direction: were very ſtudious to inſinuate themſelves in the like good Opinion of <hi>Sixtus</hi>; and to that end courted Cardinal <hi>Montalto,</hi> inviting him often to the Recreations, and Exerciſes of their Schools, that (if poſſible) they might prefer a Confeſſor to the Pope: which motion when it was made to <hi>Sixtus</hi>; he in great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation anſwered, That it were better, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> confeſſed to the Pope, than the Pope to the <hi>Jeſuits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howſoever, they ſtill continued their courtſhip towards him, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him one day to hear Maſs in the new Chappel built by <hi>Gregory</hi>; and being introduced thereunto by way of the Cloiſters, he was detained a while by the young Scholars who rehearſed many Verſes in honour of their great Benefactor Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> particularly recounting the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Benefits and Donations they had received from him; hoping by this example to excite <hi>Sixtus</hi> to the like bounty; but he not being a Perſon to be wheedled with fine Verſes; after he had heard all they could ſay, he told them plainly: <hi>Fathers,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>you are much miſtaken, you take us to be</hi> Gregory, <hi>and we are</hi> Sixtus, <hi>and We promiſe you ever to remain the good</hi> Sixtus, <hi>and never to be the bad</hi> Gregory.</p>
               <p>At another time being perſuaded by them to come to a ſolemn Feſtival celebrated at their College; they with that occaſion ſhewed him the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, and neatneſs of their Houſe, and the convenience of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: all which <hi>Sixtus</hi> much approving, merrily told them, <hi>That he would rather ſee their Treaſury, than their Refectory:</hi> to which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rector anſwered: <hi>That they had never been ſo poor, as at preſent. Continue ſo ſtill,</hi> ſaid <hi>Sixtus, for unleſs you be poor, you ſhall never be truly Religious; for your Poverty is beneficial to the Church, and your Riches prejudicial to the Popes.</hi> By theſe ſharp Replies, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had touched the pulſe of the Pope, and finding that nothing was to be gotten by him, would never trouble him afterwards with Requeſts or begging Petitions. Howſoever <hi>Sixtus</hi> in his heart loved and affected this People, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eing excellent Spies, and ſuch as brought him the beſt Intelligence; and therefore he was often heard to ſay, <hi>That the</hi> Jeſuits <hi>were the beſt ſort of Religious Orders, and uſeful in the Church, and that he loved them heartily, becauſe they asked him nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtus</hi> had for a long time got a fancy, or project in his head to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine all the <hi>Courteſans,</hi> or Whores in <hi>Rome</hi> within a place, or circuit of the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50681:319"/>
City, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were; and having communicated this Deſign to the Governour of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was made ſenſible by him of the great difficulty of the thing; for that their numbers filled the greateſt part of the City: howſoever, not being able to ſuffer the propudious, and ſhameleſs <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſans</hi> to live intermixed with the honourable, and vertuous Matrons; he baniſhed the moſt common and impudent ſtrumpets from the City, confining the remaining part within a certain limit, and quarter of the Town. But this remedy of Vice, enereaſed two great Evils: for the ſmall number of <hi>Courteſans</hi> did not abate the ſin, but procured greater cuſtom and Trade to the Ladies of Pleaſure, who having more employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than they could turn their hands unto: the looſer ſort of <hi>Italians</hi> for want of Women burned in luſt one towards the other, and addicted themſelves to that abominable, and unnatural Crime of <hi>Sodomy</hi>; of which the Pope being made ſenſible, he reverſed his ſentence, and gave licenſe to the baniſhed Whores to return to their uſual ſtations: howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtrict Orders were given, that Prieſts ſhould not entertain Wenches in their Houſes under the notion of Servants, or Houſe-keepers; which yet was ſo connived at, that when it was told the Pope, that a certain Cardinal kept a Miſtris; <hi>The better,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>for having his Conſcience ſtained with this ſcandal, he will be the more cautious, how he ſpeaks boldly, or with freedom in our preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This firſt year of the Pontificate of <hi>Sixtus</hi> was in the Month of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> ended with the promotion of eight Cardinals, all Men of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and merit; amongſt which <hi>Hippolito Aldobrandino</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> was one, with title of Cardinal <hi>Pancratio,</hi> who was afterwards created Pope, and called <hi>Clement</hi> VIII.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtus</hi> being now at eaſe in his Chair, began his ſecond year with the long deſired work of raiſing the <hi>Obeliſke,</hi> called by the <hi>Italians Aguglia,</hi>

This <hi>Obeliſke,</hi> as ſome Writers affirm, was made by <hi>Nycoreus,</hi> who reigned in <hi>Egypt</hi> about the time of <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi>; and that at firſt it was one hundred and fifty Cubits high, but in raiſing of it, it broke, and ſo was ſhortned fifty Cubits, which afterwards with ſeveral others of leſs mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſecrated to <hi>Octavianus Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> his adopted Son, as may be ſeen by this Inſciption now remaining,

                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:50681:320"/>To erect this <hi>Obelisk</hi> without breaking it, was accounted a matter of that difficulty, and Art, that none would undertake it: till at length <hi>Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico Fontana</hi> a rare Architect of <hi>Como</hi> contrived the Engines to perform the work, which were ſo many, that the materials of them, the labour, and the workmanſhip coſt thirty ſix thouſand Crowns; there is a Book extant in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, which I have ſeen, that deſcribes all the Inſtruments, and Engines which were formed for that Deſign.

               <p>Beſides this great Work, <hi>Sixtus</hi> alſo was very induſtrious this year, and intent in great and mighty works of Munificence and Charity.

To which Aqueduct he gave the name of <hi>Felice,</hi> which was the name he owned, when he was a Frier.</p>
               <p>He built alſo the Portico of the <hi>Lateran</hi> which is a Noble Sructure.

He built a very ſtately Church and dedicated it to St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and endowed it with a plentiful Revenue. But amongſt all the magnificent ſtructures which he hath raiſed, there is none ſo famous, and worthy of his Name as the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, being about three hundred and eighteen foot in length, and ſixty nine in breadth; on the Walls are painted all the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils in <hi>Freſco,</hi> with the famous Libraries mentioned by antient Authors, as alſo the manner of raiſing the <hi>Guglia</hi> or <hi>Obeliſque</hi> before St. <hi>Peters.</hi> At the entry to this Library are two Statues of Marble, that on the right hand repreſents <hi>Ariſtides</hi> an antient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> that on the leſt is <hi>Hypolitus</hi> who firſt invented the perpetual Kalendar, he lived fourteen hundred years ago.

               <p>Thus far have we diſcourſed concerning the humour and diſpoſition of this Pope, his Conduct, and Wiſdom in the management of Affairs rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church, together with his Munificence, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Soul in matters of building, and ſtately Structures, which have perpetuated his memory to theſe times.

               </p>
               <p>In order whereunto, in the firſt place, he formed and ſetled the Militia of the Church in ſo good a method, that he was able within the ſpace of one Month to bring twenty thouſand fighting Men into the Field; and in the next place, he conſulted with the moſt knowing Enginiers in what manner the Eccleſiaſtical State might be moſt commodiouſly, and with moſt advantage fortified, the which was executed with moſt Labour, and Art on that ſide which borders on the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>; which was a juſt cauſe of jealouſie to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who by the words, and actions of this Pope, had long ſuſpected, that his Intentions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns tended towards that Kingdom, the poſſeſſion of which he had for a long time ſwallowed in his thoughts, reſolving not longer to content himſelf with the bare feud, or tribute for it: the which jealouſie was encreaſed, when they found the Pope intent in building ten new Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, for defraying the coſt of which, and of their maintenance, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a new Tax on the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the whole Eccleſiaſtical State.</p>

The Pope with all readineſs embracing the Propoſition, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched <hi>Baptiſta Santorio</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Fricarico</hi> and Steward of his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to be, and remain his Nuntio within the Dominions of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Cantons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Santorio</hi> being there arrived, found all things in great diſorder, the people living without, (as it were) any reſpect, or dependance on the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea, by reaſon that for many years the Popes had not thought this Country worthy the charge or maintenance of a Nuntio therein. But now <hi>Santorio</hi> appearing there with the Character, and in the quality of a Nuntio, cauſed ſpeedily a Diet to be convened in the Month of <hi>October</hi> 1586. at which two things were agreed, and concluded highly advantageous to the Papal Authority. The firſt was, that all the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which were preſent in great numbers received the Communion from the hand of the Nuntio, and then entered into ſtrict League and Confederacy together, ſolemnly ſwearing before the Altar to maintain, and uphold the Papal Authority, and to ſacrifice their lives and fortunes in the defence thereof. In the ſecond place, they gave full power and Authority unto the Nuntio to exerciſe a free, and Arbitrary Juriſdiction over all Eccleſiaſtical perſons within their Dominions, ſubjecting them to his Courts as well in criminal, as in civil Cauſes: which was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, that the Wiſe Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> did never judge fit to grant, notwithſtanding all the bluſter, and noiſe with which the Popes requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and challenged it from them. But this Power given to the Nuntio, was the cauſe ſoon after of ſome diſturbance amongſt the <hi>Cantons</hi>; for it happened, That one day the Nuntio having Complaints brought him againſt a certain Prieſt for ſcandal, and misbehaviour, he immediately iſſued out his Warrant to the chief Conſtable and his Officers to take, and ſeize the perſon of that Prieſt, and put him into ſafe cuſtody: the Prieſt hearing of this proſecution, fled into the Dominions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant <hi>Cantons,</hi> where the Officers purſuing him, took him, and by violence and force brought him thence, and ſecured him in the Nuntio's Priſon. The news of this Attempt allarm'd all the Proteſtant <hi>Cantons,</hi> who by way of Repriſals ſeized the firſt Prieſt they could meet, and confined him within their own Priſon, reſolving not to ſet him at liberty, without the releaſe, or enlargement of the other. This Accident cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great diſturbance and commotions both amongſt the Proteſtants, and Catholicks: Diets being called on both ſides, matters ran ſo high, that a general rupture, or War was feared of all the <hi>Cantons.</hi> The Nuntio being alſo ſenſible of theſe diſorders, and not knowing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what they might amount, wrote to the Pope the whole ſum of this matter, to which he returned anſwer in this manner: <hi>We have ſent you to pacifie, and quiet matters, and not to make diſturbances, to give eaſe, and repoſe to the Catholicks, and not to put Arms into the hands of the Hereticks, to convert the one, and not to put the others into danger, no people will be contented to loſe their own right; the point of Juriſdiction is more nice, and brittle than a Chriſtal Glaſs, and therefore thoſe caſes are to be managed tenderly, and with ſevere caution: troubles, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets are dangerous to Catholicks, but to Hereticks it may be profitable
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50681:321"/>
to fiſh in troubled Waters: to give to Hereticks is a great evil, but to take from them is highly dangerous. Be therefore prudent in this caſe, both for your own quiet, and for mine.</hi> The Nuntio collecting from this Anſwer, that it was the Pope's pleaſure to accommodate theſe matters; He ordered it ſo, that the Prieſt ſhould be ſet at liberty, but by way of eſcape, rather than by formal enlargement; the like expedient the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants took, as to the other Prieſt, by which means theſe matters were pacified, and concluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> III. King of <hi>France,</hi> (as before related) having compoſed his quarrel with the Pope about reception of his Nuntio the Biſhop of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaret</hi>; ſo good and fair a correſpondence paſſed between them, that the King adventured to demand licenſe of the Pope to raiſe a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns from the revenue of the Church. <hi>Sixtus</hi> who was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to deprive the Church of ſuch a ſum, nor yet to diſoblige the King by a plain and poſitive refuſal; entertained his Ambaſſadour the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Piſani</hi> with a delatory Anſwer, ſuch as this, <hi>We ſhall conſider, we ſhall do nothing raſhly, but with Mature conſideration</hi>; which being often repeated, and the Ambaſſadours wearied with ſuch inſignificant puts off, which according to the ſtile of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> imported no leſs than a civil denial, acquainted the King with their Sentiments in the caſe, which were, that nothing could be expected from the Pope's bounty or conceſſion; upon which advice, and upon a belief, that this refuſal was inſtilled by ſuch Inſtruments, as were employed in the Catholick League, and particularly by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and his party: the King reſolved to ſtand on his own bottom and to ſteer a courſe between the League, and the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> for as he durſt not confide in the Catholick League, ſo he feared the iſſue of the War againſt his Proteſtant Subjects, both which though to appearance were equally dangerous, yet a peace with the latter ſeemed moſt ſafe, and deſireable; in purſuance of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, a peace being concluded with the Proteſtants by negotiation of the Queen, the promotors of the League, of which the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was the Chief, diſpatched an Expreſs immediately to <hi>Rome,</hi> giving the Pope to underſtand the matter in theſe preciſe words:
<q>That the cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was betrayed: That the Cauſe of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> was openly, and publickly favoured: That the meaſures of the War were broken, and all expectation of good, and benefit loſt, which might redound by means of the League to the Catholick Cauſe: That the heart of the King ſeemed much eſtranged to the Catholick party, reſolving to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſe, protect, and maintain the Hereſie in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope, ſo ſoon as he received this Intelligence, called the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, to whom with words full of diſdain, and fury he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the proceedings of the King, whom he mentioned as one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Hereſie, and already alienated and eſtranged from the Papal Sea; and having called a Conſiſtory, Letters were wrote to the Nuntio <hi>Nazaret,</hi> with Orders to intimate the Pope's juſt complaints to the King, giving him to underſtand, how much he did reſent the Reſolution he had taken to the prejudice of the Catholick Church, which was of ſuch ill conſequence, as took deep impreſſion in the mind of the Pope, and would be recorded with everlaſting Characters of Infamy in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Reign. The Nuntio having received theſe Inſtructions, and being backed by the inſtigation of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> repreſented the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50681:322"/>
Pope's ſence in warm, and paſſionate terms: In return unto which, the King, contrary to the equal temper of his nature, retorted an Anſwer in brisk and ſharp Expreſſions: <hi>That it was a fine, and eaſie matter for the Pope to ſtand and behold at a diſtance the miſeries and afflictions of his Country, and to give Counſel without aſſiſtance, or contribution to the War; for want of which, and of a licenſe to alienate ſo much of the Lands of the Church, as might ſerve to raiſe the ſum of a hundred thouſand Crowns, he was forced for preſervation of his Kingdom, and Regal Dignity, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe Conditions, which they called, ruinous to the Church.</hi> And then moderating his paſſion a little, in more gentle, and mild terms, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the Nuntio, <hi>to aſſure the Pope; That he would ever adhere, and remain conſtant to the faith of the Catholick Church, and act in every thing to the advancement of it, ſo far, as he was able, and that the want onely of Money had forced him to this reſolution.</hi> Theſe particulars being wrote to <hi>Rome,</hi> quieted a little the mind of the Pope, who did all the time before, do nothing either in the Conſiſtory with the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, or in his Diſcourſes with the forein Miniſters, but rail and ſtorm againſt the <hi>French</hi> King. But being now ſatisfied by his Nuntio that the King had changed his mind, and would be induced to continue the War againſt the Proteſtants, provided he could be aſſiſted with Aid from the Church; the Pope immediately appointed a Bull to be drawn up, and ſealed, giving Authority and Power to the King, not onely to raiſe a hundred thouſand Crowns out of the Eſtate of the Church, as the King had demanded, but alſo twenty thouſand Crowns more for better encouragement to continue, and perſevere in the aſſurances given; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the Nuntio to raiſe thoſe ſums on the Clergy, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, or delatory proceedings.</p>
               <p>Thus as <hi>Sixtus</hi> was zealous, and profuſe in ſuch Expences, as he judged conducive to the ſupport of the Papal Authority; ſo he was no leſs generous in works, which might tend to the honour and ornament of it: In which conſideration reflecting one day on the manner, and garb, in which he deſired his Nuntios might live in the Courts of forein Princes; he thought it would be more magnificent to buy, or purchaſe Palaces for them, in the Capital Cities, and Courts, rather than to rent Houſes which appeared mean and low in the Eyes of the World. The <hi>Venetians</hi> ſo ſoon as they underſtood the Pope's Deſign herein, which they were extreamly forward to gratifie, immediately wrote to their Ambaſſadour reſiding at <hi>Rome,</hi> ordering him to acquaint the Pope, that the Senate out of their good will, and affection to the Papal Sea, had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to beſtow on the Nuntios Apoſtolical a Palace, wherein to reſide at <hi>Venice,</hi> and to remain to them, and their Succeſſours for ever: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly gave poſſeſſion, to <hi>Matteucci</hi> the Pope's Nuntio then reſiding, of a magnificent Palace in the ſquare of St. <hi>Francis</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi>; and by Deeds, and conveyances under the Seal of St. <hi>Mark</hi> paſſed over the right, and title thereof unto the preſent Nuntio and his Succeſſours for ever. The Pope having received the news hereof, confirmed by the authentick Copy of the Deed, was ſo greatly pleaſed, that with a Letter full of kind Expreſſions he returned his thanks to the Republick for their generous Preſent; and leſt he ſhould ſeem to be backward or defective in the like liberal returns, he aſſigned to the Miniſter of <hi>Venice</hi> an other Palace at <hi>Rome,</hi> in lieu of that which they had preſented to his Nuntio
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50681:322"/>
at <hi>Venice.</hi> Other Princes according to this Example were inclined to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the Papal Miniſter with a Habitation; in expectation of a like exchange at <hi>Rome</hi>; but the truth was, the Pope began to grow ſenſible of an inconvenience in this ſort of Preſents; for that he could neither find Palaces in <hi>Rome</hi> ſufficient to receive ſo many Miniſters, as were ſent him from forein Princes, in lieu of thoſe which were allotted to his Nuntios in the reſpective Courts; nor ſituation of places ſo fitted to the humour and rank of each Repreſentative, but that the condition of the Palace being more, or leſs magnificent might adminiſter cauſe of exception, and quarrel to the reſpective Miniſters: for which reaſon the Pope conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better of this matter, refuſed after the Preſent made him by <hi>Venice,</hi> to accept the like from any other Prince, declining the Obligation with a Complement, and an Excuſe; and that rather than put the Prince to ſo great an Expence, he was reſolved to purchaſe Houſes for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of his Nuntios with his own Money.</p>
               <p>Thus as <hi>Sixtus</hi> was haughty in his nature, and affected high, and glorious matters; ſo he was ſevere, and moroſe, judging every criminal action, or misbehaviour in Men to proceed from a contempt, or want of fear, which Men ought to bear towards his Government. Several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of which might be given; but becauſe we would not enlarge into many particulars, we ſhall only mention one Story not unpleaſant to be related, which was this: The Statue of <hi>Paſquine</hi> (into the hand of which all Libels are put at <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence they are called <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quils</hi>) was one day covered with a very dirty Shirt; and that other Statue called <hi>Marforio</hi> asking the reaſon of it, <hi>Paſquine</hi> anſwered, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Landreſs had left him to be made a Princeſs,</hi> alluding to the Lady <hi>Camilla</hi> the Pope's Siſter, who from a Landreſs was promoted to be a great Lady. The report of this <hi>Paſquil</hi> was immediately brought to the Pope, who conceiving thereat a ſecret indignation, endeavoured by his Spies to detect the Author of it; but this being a ſecret known only to the Party himſelf, the diſcovery ſeemed impoſſible by other means, than the Confeſſion of the Author; to procure which, the Pope pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed an Edict, wherein he promiſed upon the word of a Pope to give two thouſand Piſtols, together with the ſafety of his life to any perſon, who ſhould reveal the matter and confeſs himſelf to be the Author of this <hi>Paſquil</hi>; and on the contrary threatned the Gallows, and Torments to whomſoever ſhould be diſcovered, and by ſufficient teſtimony be proved guilty.</p>
               <p>The Author being more covetous of the two thouſand Piſtols, than wiſe, went directly to the Pope, and confeſſed and acknowledged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the Perſon, who made the <hi>Paſquil:</hi> which when the Pope heard; he admired not a little at the boldneſs of the Man, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looking on him gave him this Anſwer: <hi>We are obliged to maintain the word and faith we have given you, and therefore we order, that the Money promiſed you, ſhall be paid:</hi> which being performed, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt given for it, the Pope farther added: <hi>It is true,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>We promiſed you the Money, and your life, both which we have performed, but howſoever we have reſerved another Reward for you in our breaſt, which is a Sentence that both your Hands, and Tongue be cut off, that ſo you may not be able to ſpeak, or write more Satyrs of this kind.</hi> In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this intention of the Pope, this perſon was taken into cuſtody<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:50681:323"/>
and immediately his Confeſſion produced as a teſtimony againſt him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judges; by which being convicted, immediately without delay his Hands were cut off, and his Tongue bored through; which ſort of ſevere poceedings affrighted all <hi>Rome,</hi> which was not accuſtomed to ſuch Cruelties; the which action, with ſeveral others of the like nature ſtrook an awe, and fear into the minds of all Men, ſo that generally people walk'd with great circumſpection, leſt they ſhould fall into the mercileſs, and unrelenting hands of <hi>Sixtus.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Buoncompagno,</hi> who was conſtituted Gran Penitentiary by <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. dying this year with great Riches; that Office by his deceaſe becoming vacant, it was expected, that the Pope would have conferred the place on Cardinal <hi>Montalto</hi> his Nephew: but to convince the World, that merit, and not affection prevailed in his mind, he readily conferred that Office on Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Aldobrandino,</hi> a perſon of ſingular prudence and Learning, and one whom he gladly found an occaſion to gratifie the ſervices he had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Church; the choice of a perſon ſo deſerving was acceptable to all Men, and of whom the Pope conceived ſuch an eſteem, that he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him all the ſecrets of his Counſels, being confidently aſſured of the prudence, ſincerity, and profoundneſs of his judgment.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">87.</note>The year 1587. being the third year of the Pontificate of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> was now entered, when the People of <hi>Rome</hi> reflecting on the great plenty, and abundance of all proviſions within the City, cauſed by the care and wiſe contrivance of the Pope, whileſt all the neighbouring Dominions laboured under want, and ſcarcity: And alſo beholding the City of <hi>Rome</hi> by the munificence of this Pope adorned with ſtately Edifices; the Citizens received ſo much ſatisfaction thereby, that they erected a Statue of Braſs to him in the Capitol with this Inſcription: <hi>Sixto</hi> V. <hi>Pont. Max. ob quietem publicam compreſsâ Sicariorum, Exulumque licentiâ, reſtitutam Annonae inopiam, ſublevatam urbem, Edificiis, Viis, Aquaeductu illuſtratam,</hi> S.P.Q.R.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtus</hi> for his divertiſement did often uſe to walk about the City In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito, or in diſguiſe; in which kind of perambulation paſſing once in his Coach by the Convent of the Holy Apoſtles he was pleaſed to alight and enter into the Convent; the Gate being open, he went firſt into the Porters Lodge, who was then a <hi>Probationer,</hi> or in the firſt year of his Novitiate: the Pope ſurprizing him, whileſt he was eating a diſh of Beans, was pleaſed with the remembrance of his own poor condition, when in the like poſture he was forced to content himſelf with the ſame Diet; in contemplation of which, he ſat down on the ſtairs, and taking a wooden Spoon began to eat heartily, and help the Porter to make an end of his Meſs. The ſtanders by wondered at the humour, and fancy of the Pope, and eſpecially to ſee him eat up the oiled Beans ſo heartily; which when he had done, he aroſe up and thanked the Porter: ſaying, <hi>Theſe Beans will add two years of life to us, becauſe we have eaten them with a good appetite, and without fear.</hi> And then lifting up his eyes to Heaven, he ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be thy Name moſt Almighty Father, that thou haſt grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this favour to thy High Prieſt to eat once in peace and quietneſs.</hi> Thus much he was apprehended to ſay, out of the caution and fear he had of Poiſon; for he was confident, that the Porters Beans were free from ſuch Ingredients; though he could not be ſecure of his own Diſhes at home; of which living in continual ſuſpition, he confined his Cook al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50681:323"/>
ways to his Kitchin, keeping a Guard always upon him to keep him from all correſpondence or communication with others. The Pope thus pleaſed with his Entertainment, commanded that the Porter, who was a <hi>Probationer</hi> onely, ſhould be immediately veſted in the Friers habit; which being performed; in his preſence he gave him his Bleſſing at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, adding theſe words: <hi>We have been what you are, do you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be what we are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we muſt not omit to recount one pleaſant paſſage, before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to more ſerious, and important Affairs. <hi>Sixtus</hi> out of an affection to the Friers of his own Order, had a deſire to celebrate this year a Chapter General, over which he would preſide in Perſon, giving licenſe not onely to ſuch Friers as were invited thereunto; but alſo to all others, who had the curioſity to be there preſent: and not to burden the Order with the expence, which ſuch a concourſe of people might bring, he declared that he would bear the charge on his own account; by reaſon of which, never was any Chapter at <hi>Rome</hi> celebrated with ſuch State, and Magnificence as this. At this Chapter a new General of the Order being choſen; the Pope commanded, that after the Election all the Friers ſhould walk in proceſſion to kiſs his Feet at the <hi>Vatican</hi>; giving the Friers to underſtand the day before, that he gave licenſe to every one of them to demand ſome grace, or favour from him, by which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Act of benevolence, he might give ſufficient teſtimony to the World of that love, and affection which poſſeſſed his heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Companions of his Order.</p>
               <p>The Friers receiving this gracious Meſſage by their Cardinal Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, were highly exalted in their ſpirits, and every one began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with himſelf what Boon, or Gift, or priviledg would be moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding to his own convenience. In the mean time the report of this exceſſive Grace flying about into all Convents of the City: the Friers of other Orders began to envy the happineſs and fortune of the <hi>Cordeliers:</hi> the <hi>Dominicans</hi> murmured againſt <hi>Pius</hi> V. who had never evidenced the like reſpect towards them: the Cardinals alſo repined, and blamed the prodigality, and exceſs of the Pope in promiſing favour to every individual Frier of his Order; when on all the Cardinals together he never beſtowed one ray of his bounty, nor granted one priviledg to the whole Sacred College.</p>
               <p>But theſe Diſcourſes little touched the mind of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> who the next day gave admiſſion to the Friers one after the other, as they were in Precedency, and Seniority; at the reception of whom the Pope ſat in his Chair of State, and his Secretary on his left hand at a little Table to take their Names, and a brief of the Petitions, and Requeſts they made, the which for the moſt part were ſo ridiculous, and extravagant, as yielded the Pope, ſubject ſufficient for laughter, and paſs-time: For one being a <hi>Napolitan</hi> whiſpering in the Pope's Ear, deſired, that he might have licenſe to renounce his Order, and marry, or elſe, that he might have a Diſpenſation to keep a Wench, and not be liable to the Cenſure of his Superiours: ſome of them demanded to be made Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, others to be made Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, and Abbots with other Dignities: ſome would have crept into the Offices which belonged to other Orders: one particularly demanding to be made Chief Maſter of the Sacred Palace, which belongs to the <hi>Dominicans:</hi> and an other deſired
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:50681:324"/>
to have Biſhops removed to make places for them. In ſhort, their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts were ſo exorbitant, that to ſatisfie them all, <hi>Sixtus</hi> muſt have overturned the whole Order of Friers, and unhinged all the Dignities, and Rules of the Church. Only it is obſervable that a poor Lay-Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had been a Cook, and Butler in a Convent, being one of the laſt to kiſs the feet of the Pope; ſhed many tears of joy at his admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to ſo unexpected an honour, which having done, the Petition he made was this: <hi>That ſince his Holineſs was pleaſed to ſuffer ſuch a poor wretch as he, to ſpeak to him, all he had to deſire, was onely this, that he would vouchſafe out of his great bounty to build a Fountain for his Convent, which ſuffered very much (as his Holineſs well knew) for want of Water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Friers having thus in their order expoſed their ſeveral Petitions, they were called in together: and then in a full Aſſembly, the Pope made this general Anſwer to them all; <hi>Had your petitions, and demands been correſpondent to our expectation, we ſhould have made no difficulty of giving ſatisfaction to your deſires: We imagined, that you, who are perſons ſequeſtred from the World, would have entertained no thoughts of particular intereſt: for Friers having their wills reſtrained, and bound up with chains of Obedience; can poſſeſs nothing in reference to their own perſons, but onely with regard to the publick benefit; to which Rule had you confined your deſires, our bounty had been enlarged to the ultimate conceſſion of what you could demand; which we are now forced to deny, leſt we ſhould offend againſt the Rules of your primary Inſtitution and Vows, which require you to mortifie, rather than me to gratifie your Ambition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus were the Friers all diſmiſſed from the Pope's preſence, where Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions and Deſires became the common talk and laughter of the Town, and ſerved to diſcover the ſecret, that the minds of mortified Friers are as capable of vain thoughts and ambitious deſires, as thoſe of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Men, who profeſs not the like ſtrictneſs of mortification and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Howſoever, the poor Lay-brother's requeſt for a Fountain was taken into conſideration; for that being agreeable to the Munificent hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Sixtus</hi> was received, and immediately ordered to be put in execution by bringing Water to the Convent from the Pope's Gardens at <hi>Monte-cavallo,</hi> which flows there in plentiful ſtreams. But now to proceed unto more ſerious matters.</p>
               <p>Towards the end of this year 1587. <hi>Stephen Battory</hi> Prince of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania,</hi> and King of <hi>Poland,</hi> having reigned in that Kingdom for the ſpace of nine years, departed this life: his death was univerſally la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by all, having proved a moſt excellent Prince, and a zealous Champion of the Chriſtian Religion againſt the <hi>Turk:</hi> for he recovered the Dukedoms of <hi>Suevia,</hi> and <hi>Smolensko</hi> from the <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> and united them again to the Crown of <hi>Poland.</hi> He alſo behaved himſelf with conſtant reſolution againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> who having in the year 1584. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded according to antient Articles aſſiſtance of ſome <hi>Poliſh</hi> Troops againſt the <hi>Perſians: Battory</hi> reſolutely denied them to him, ſaying, <hi>That, whereas the white Eagle of</hi> Poland <hi>had lately moulted her feathers, and was diſplumed, and become weak, ſhe had now recovered her wings, and her train, and had ſharpned both her beak, and her talons:</hi> Which brisk Reply and bravery of <hi>Battory</hi> in all the actions of his Reign,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50681:324"/>
did calm the ſpirit of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and checked thoſe frequent Incurſions, which they made into <hi>Poland.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Battori,</hi> as we have ſaid, dying this year, the Nobility of that Kingdom were very deſirous to elect a King, who might in Wiſdom, and Courage prove equal to the valour of the deceaſed Prince. Many there were, who offered themſelves Candidates for that Election. <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi> the Son of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, was one, who for being of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> ſeemed qualified for that Crown: Some caſt their eyes on the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who for his prudence, and experience in War, was one of the moſt renowned Captains of thoſe days: but being an <hi>Italian,</hi> it was ſuſpected, that his humour would not be agrre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the cuſtoms of <hi>Poland.</hi> The Vaivod of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Battori</hi> were others, who appeared fitly qualified for this Dignity: the firſt being a young Man, and full of ſpirit, aſſiſted with the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his own Riches, and in great reputation with the <hi>Turk,</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a luſtre deſerving a Crown, but having been Nephew to the late King, his Alliance prejudiced his pretentions, not being conſiſtent with the policy of that Nation, to have a ſucceſſion in the ſame Family; the ſame conſideration alſo was an impediment to the Cardinal, though otherwiſe a Prince of excellent Endowments.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> was an other propoſed, but he, as well as the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was an <hi>Italian,</hi> whoſe humour was inconſiſtent with the Poles.</p>
               <p>Many Nobles alſo of <hi>Poland</hi> it ſelf ſeemed fitly qualified both in Riches, and Vertue for that Dignity; amongſt which <hi>Zamowski</hi> the Grand Chancellour had a moſt conſiderable party: for, he having managed all the Affairs of that Kingdom during the Reign of <hi>Battori,</hi> who commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated all his Counſels with him, and entruſted him with the greateſt ſecrets of State; by which he became the moſt experienced in Affairs, and high in Reputation, living little inferiour to the Royal pomp: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Nobles not enduring at that time ſubjection to any of their own degree, and Country; and having never for the ſpace of ſix hundred years admitted a Prince of their own to reign over them, they would neither now introduce a Novelty repugnant to their antient cuſtoms, and conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>Upon the preceding conſiderations the election falling on none of the foregoing Princes; the Votes came at length to concenter between the Prince of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria</hi> called <hi>Maximilian,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Emperor <hi>Ridolphus,</hi> a perſon of that affable, and obliging deportment, as took much with the humour of the <hi>Polanders.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, the contrary party and the moſt prevalent objected; that being Brother to the Emperor, he might be too potent, and in time by the power of <hi>Germany</hi> ſubvert the Government, and turn it from an elective to an hereditary Kingdom: wherefore totally declining <hi>Maximilian,</hi> this party reſolutely fixed on the Prince of <hi>Sweden</hi> a youth of twenty years of age, greatly favoured by the <hi>Poles</hi> for being deſcended from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of <hi>Jagellona</hi>; which for having added the Dukedom of <hi>Lituania</hi> to their Commonwealth, was ſo highly eſteemed by them, that the merit to that Family could be no otherwiſe extinguiſhed, than by transferring the Crown to the Prince thereof. But theſe conſiderations in favour of <hi>Sweden</hi> were turned to quite contrary Sentiments by the differing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:50681:325"/>
ſo that the whole body of the Nobility being divided between theſe two Princes, the Election ſtill remained in ſuſpenſe; both deſigning to determine the Diſpute by force of Arms.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the Election remained under theſe doubtful circumſtances, <hi>Sixtus</hi> wrote to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Naples,</hi> then Nuntio reſiding at the place of Election, ſecretly to favour the ſide of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> but yet with ſuch caution, as not too far to engage himſelf, but that, in caſe fortune favoured the Prince of <hi>Sweden,</hi> he might without a blemiſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf for that party, that ſo he might own in ſome meaſure his Election unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maximilian</hi> to make good his cauſe appearing before <hi>Cracovia</hi> with an Army of ſixteen thouſand fighting Men, demanded of the Citizens to receive him in; but they refuſed it, and ſent with all diligence to the Prince of <hi>Sweden</hi> to expedite his March, for that delays in this caſe were dangerous, and that the day of his Coronation was fixed to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Feaſt of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> then near approaching: In the mean time, they repaired their Fortifications, and ſtrengthened their Suburbs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king daily Sallies on the Forces of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and moſt commonly were ſucceſsful therein to the great encouragement of the Citizens.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time after, Ambaſſadours arrived at <hi>Cracon</hi> from the Prince of <hi>Sweden,</hi> adviſing that the Prince, though detained by contrary Winds, was come as far as <hi>Donzilca,</hi> and that though it was impoſſible for him to be ſo ſoon with them as St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s day; yet certainly he would not fail to be there by St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s, which was on the 15th. of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and be ready to receive that Dignity on the <hi>Sunday</hi> following; for according to the cuſtom of that Country the Coronation muſt always be ſolemnized on the Lord's Day.</p>
               <p>During all this time the Army of <hi>Maximilian</hi> was greatly weakned for want of proviſions; and having neither Wine, nor good Beer, they were forced to drink bad Waters, which with the cold and moiſture of the ſeaſon cauſed Fluxes and Dyſenteries and other diſtempers amongſt the Soldiery, which reduced them to ſmall numbers. Howſoever <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximilian</hi> leaving the City of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> marched towards <hi>Pietricovia</hi> with intention to ſtop the march of the Prince of <hi>Sweden:</hi> but finding that the Army of his Enemy was greater, than his own, and that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the worſt in many Skirmiſhes, he retreated to <hi>Bellone,</hi> and thence to <hi>Pitſchen</hi> of the frontiers of <hi>Sileſia</hi> belonging to the Duke of <hi>Briga.</hi> But being purſued thither by the Enemy, he was there beſieged, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken Priſoner towards the end of <hi>January</hi> 1588.</p>
               <p>The Pope who was greatly concerned for this diſgrace of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> diſpeeded Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> into <hi>Poland</hi> to treat a Peace, and an Accommodation between <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and the Prince; the which after various difficulties, and Diſputes was happily concluded, about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>March</hi> 1589. The Articles of which were, that <hi>Maximilian</hi> ſhould renounce all Title, and pretence to the Crown of <hi>Poland</hi> by reaſon of the late Election, or any other demand whatſoever; and that the Prince of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould remain the lawful and undoubted King: which being agreed the Prince took poſſeſſion, and was named <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> III.</p>
               <p>The Pope, who was no leſs zealous for the ſucceſs of the King's Arms in <hi>France</hi> againſt his Proteſtant Subjects; ſent a Sword to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was chief of the Catholick League, as he had lately done
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50681:325"/>
to the Prince <hi>Farneſe,</hi> who was Governour of <hi>Flanders</hi>; the which was delivered by a Biſhop who was purpoſely ſent to preſent it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to tender his paternal love, and benediction to the Duke, aſſuring him that he poſſeſſed a large room in the heart and breaſt of the Pope. The Ceremony of delivering this Sword was performed with ſuch pomp, and triumph at <hi>Paris,</hi> and with ſuch popular acclamations of the multitude in favour of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> as adminiſtred juſt cauſe of jealouſie, and fear to the King; and though <hi>Guiſe</hi> was ambitious enough to be pleaſed therewith, yet being immoderate, and irregular, his modeſty told him, that they were undecent. The King in the mean time being eclipſed by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular grandeur of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and by the troubles of a Civil War with which his Kingdom was infeſted, did ſeem to reſent the favours which the Pope ſhewed to <hi>Guiſe,</hi> as unſeaſonable; of which when <hi>Sixtus</hi> had knowledg, and of the popular acclamations at the delivery of his Sword, he was much troubled; for he being of a humour always deſirous to maintain Sovereignty in its higheſt degree of Honour, and Power, did by a Letter to the King exhort him to maintain his Prerogatives, and conſerve the honour of his Crown againſt the Inſolencies, and rebellions of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: adding, <hi>That a Canker in the bowels of his State was curable onely by cauterizing, and by fire, and Sword: and that it was neceſſary to vent ſome of that blood, which was too redundant in the veins of his Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King made frequent reflections on this Letter, and often gave it to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to read, and conſider: and being one day in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, where many Debates aroſe touching the ways, and means by which the Civil Wars might be accommodated, and a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing produced between him and his Subjects; the King declared the great averſion of his mind to blood, or other extremities; which though he might juſtly by the Counſels, and perſuaſions of the Pope, yet he was more tender of the lives of his Subjects, than to cure his troubles by ſuch ſevere Remedies; and to confirm the truth thereof, he produced the Pope's Letter, cauſing it publickly to be read in that Aſſembly: which when the Parliament heard, they Bleſſed themſelves, and as well the Catholicks, as Proteſtants remained aſtoniſhed and ſcandalized at this cruelty of the Univerſal Paſtor, who with ſuch little remorſe could ſuck the blood of Chriſt's Sheep, as if he had rather been the Wolf, than Shepherd of the Chriſtian Flock. Which when the Pope un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and was informed of all the Satyrs, and Libels which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants had compoſed on this occaſion, he was greatly diſturbed, that the King ſhould ſo publickly expoſe his Counſels, which he deſigned for his ſecret directions; and having ſignified his reſentment thereof by his Nuntio, he would never afterwards adventure to write him a Letter, but on all occaſions of buſineſs referred himſelf by word of mouth to the report of his Nuntio.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Sixtus</hi> whoſe thoughts were ever employed on means which might enlarge, or make great the Church; did much incite <hi>Philip</hi> II. King of <hi>Spain</hi> to make War on <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>England,</hi> preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to re-aſſume his Right to that Kingdom which he had once go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; and for encouragement thereunto, he promiſed Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> the King's Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſo ſoon as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army ſhould be landed on any part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhoar, he would immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50681:326"/>
a million of Crowns to that Deſign. Nor was the Pope moved hereunto out of a zeal onely to Religion, but out of a ſecular Deſign; ſuppoſing that the chief Flower of the Nobility and Soldiery of <hi>Naples</hi> being drained thence on this Enterprize, he might have a more facil paſſage to the poſſeſſion of that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>In purſuance therefore of this Deſign, a great and wonderful Fleet of vaſt Caracks to the number of one hundred and fifty Sail being ſet to Sea, on which were twenty three thouſand Land Soldiers, with two thouſand pieces of Cannon, of which the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> was made General; they entered the Channel of <hi>England,</hi> where being met by a ſmall Fleet of Ships under the Command of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> ſeveral broad-ſides paſſed between them: but at length the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence aſſiſting <hi>England,</hi> and defending the Proteſtant Cauſe; the valour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the ſucceſsful direction of the Fire-ſhips prevailed with admirable fortune over the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> againſt whom alſo God himſelf fighting, (as we may ſay) by his Storms and Tempeſts: totally defeated, and deſtroyed this invincible Armada, as we may more at large read in our Chronicles of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtus</hi> having received the news of this unhappy defeat, wrote Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to <hi>Philip</hi> to condole with him for the loſs: and therewith taking an occaſion to blame the management and conduct of his Officers, he attributed the miſcarriage of all to the want of care, and experience of the Chief Commanders: by which reflection of diſgrace his intent was, to prevent all Demands from him of reparation for this loſs; and on this ſubject he proceeded in a publick Conſiſtory to blame, and tax every Individual Chief both in the Army, and in the Council of ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; onely he took upon him to excuſe <hi>Alexander Farneſe</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and to anſwer the aſperſions which his Enemies had charged upon him, declaring him to be the onely perſon, who for his perſonal Valour, and excellency of his Conduct was the moſt approved Captain of that Age.</p>
               <p>This Letter of Condolance wrote by the Pope was diſpatched to his Nuntio at <hi>Madrid</hi> to be delivered to the King, whoſe conſtancy of mind, and evenneſs of temper was ſuch, that though the Nuntio well knew he had no need of Cordials, or conſolatory Exhortations, yet the Commands of his Maſter, were to be obeyed, and the formality obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Whileſt King <hi>Philip</hi> was reading the Letter, he often ſmiled, as if the Stile had rather been to congratulate his Victory, than to condole for his loſs: Howſoever he thanked the Nuntio, and promiſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn an Anſwer thereunto ſpeedily, the which he accordingly did in the ſpace of two days after in words to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That his Holineſs would be pleaſed together with him to render thanks to God Almighty, for being pleaſed to conſerve the remnant of his Fleet from ſuch dreadful ſtorms, and tempeſts, and for beſtowing on him Riches, and Power ſufficient to ſet out, and equippe an other equal to the former. That he had ſent his Fleet to fight againſt the Enemies of Chriſt, but not to Combat with the Seas, and Winds, and therefore ſaw no cauſe to blame his Officers either Civil or Military:</q>
And in fine, perceiving the ſubtil manner of the Pope to foreſtall his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of ſuccours, or reparations, he concluded his Letter in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
<q>That the loſs did as well concern the Pope, as himſelf, by whoſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50681:326"/>
directions, and encouragement he had undertaken that Enterpriſe: That he having had the glory to have loſt a Fleet in the ſervice of Chriſt; had already performed his part; and that now for the future the next attempt belonged to the Church, in which he promiſed to follow, but not to precede.</q>
It was believed, that the King wrote with this reſolution, and indifferency of mind to the Pope; to let him know that this misfortune did not abate his Courage, or force in defence of his own Dominions; for the King was jealous, and had cauſe ſufficient to ſuſpect, that the Gallies which the Pope had lately built, and the vaſt ſums of Money, which he had lately amaſſed were with deſign on the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>; on which the Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> having always a vigilant Eye, did conſtantly inculcate to the Pope in his Diſcourſes: <hi>That ſo much as his Maſter had loſt in ſeeking the Conqueſt of others Kingdoms, as much he did not doubt but to recover on any Prince, who ſhould attempt on his Dominions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This year 1588. famous for the deſtruction of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armada, was ſignalized alſo towards the end thereof on the 23d. of <hi>December</hi> by the death of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> a Prince of ſuch popular eſteem, that he appeared greater than the King, and to eclipſed the Sovereignty, that not longer enduring to be ſo clouded, he reſolved to break through the obſcurity, by the deſtruction of the Duke, whom the King cauſed to be aſſaſſinated by eight Executioners, as he was entering into his Cloſet, being thereunto called by his Command; theſe Officers of the King's diſpleaſure ſo effectually performed their work, by the mortal ſtabs they gave him, that he had not time to utter one word, but onely breathed out his life with dying groans: the ſame day the Cardinal his Brother was impriſoned, and the next day being the Eve of <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> was put to death: the which misfortune to the Houſe of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was followed by the impriſonment of the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> the Pope's Legat at <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> and of the eldeſt Son of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The news of the Duke's death was diſpeeded to <hi>Rome</hi> with ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence by an Expreſs, that the Pope received it on the 3d. of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 1589. at the ſame time, that he was diſcourſing with the Cardinal <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> touching the Affairs, and intereſt of <hi>France.</hi> The Pope at the arrival hereof, did not ſeem troubled, or in the leaſt manner ſurprized; for though the Duke was a zealous Defender of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion, yet conſidering that he was ambitious, and popular, and one who checked the Sovereign power; the Pope who was a great Aſſertor of the Monarchical Authority in its Supreme degree, received the news of his unhappy fate without any remorſe, or reſentment; and ſo ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his ſhoulders, ſaid: <hi>Had we been King of</hi> France, <hi>we ſhould have done the ſame.</hi> And when the particulars were all recounted, he added, <hi>Such is commonly the deſtiny of Men, who committed many Errors with ſubtil Arts, but then know not how to conſerve themſelves with mature judgment, and due caution.</hi> But when about four days after that Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence came, how that the Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was likewiſe put to death, and that the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned; he then began to fume and ſtorm like an enraged Bear, venting his paſſion with ten thouſand violent expreſſions againſt the King, clapping his hands, and ſtamping with his feet on the floor, in ſuch manner as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted all his Servants, and Attendance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:50681:327"/>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> III. of <hi>France</hi> being acquainted with the humour of <hi>Sixtus</hi>; and how apt he was to reſent the leaſt injuries towards Eccleſiaſtical perſons, and encroachment on his Authority; diſpatched <hi>Girolamo Gondi</hi> a <hi>Florentine</hi> Gentleman with all expedition to <hi>Rome</hi> to join with his Ambaſſadour the Marqueſs <hi>Piſani</hi> in making excuſes for the death of the Cardinal, and the impriſonment of the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Lions,</hi> being thereunto neceſſitated contrary to his own nature for the conſervation of his own life, and Crown. <hi>Gondi</hi> being arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> and having conſulted together with the Ambaſſadour, the way, and manner, to addreſs themſelves unto the Pope; and being admitted to Audience, the Pope with a ſtern Countenance looked on them, and with ſharp, and ſevere terms began to reproach the King, wondering how he could dare to violate the immunities, and priviledges of the Eccleſiaſtical State, and the dignity of Cardinals, and againſt all Laws both Divine, and humane, could entertain ſo much wickedneſs in his heart, as to murther a Cardinal, and impriſon two others of eminent dignity in the Church, as if they had been ſubjected to the Secular power.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Ambaſſadours for Reply hereunto in modeſt terms, but yet with grave, and unmoved conſtancy began to relate the Treaſon, and Plots of which the Cardinal was guilty contrary to the Faith, and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance which he owed unto the King, with whom alſo the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> had been Complices. It is true, ſaid they, it would have beſt become the righteouſneſs, and judgment of a King to have proceeded in a juditiary way according to all the methods, and rules of Law, but the Cardinal aſſiſted by the power of his Brother, and by the Authority of the two other potent Prelates, was become too ſtrong for the Law, or to be treated by the uſual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of common Proceſs; for they having forced the King to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his Palace, and fly in diſguiſe through the ſtreets of <hi>Paris,</hi> there remained no mild terms of Accommodation, but either the King muſt become a Subject unto them, and diveſt himſelf of his Dignity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign his Power into the hands of thoſe Guardians, as if he were in his pupillage, or years of minority, or elſe he muſt ſerve himſelf of thoſe means, which God appointed him for conſervation of his Crown, and Regal Office in which he was anointed. In fine, they concluded, that the King was an obedient Son of the Church, and was ready to ſatisfie the deſires of his Holineſs to the utmoſt of his power; and to that end he had expreſly ſent this <hi>Gondi</hi> now preſent before him, humbly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech his Holineſs to pardon what was paſt, and as a teſtimony, and evidence of his reconciliation to ſend him his Bleſſing.</q>
But <hi>Sixtus</hi> having neither by theſe reaſons, nor yet by the gentle and ſubmiſſive terms of the Ambaſſadours, abated the fury and anger which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his countenance: Replyed with a loud Voice;
<q>That, he was well aſſured, that <hi>Gondi</hi> was diſpatched on an other Errand, than this; and that by any thing they had ſaid, there was no judgment to be made of ſorrow, or repentance in the King for the Crimes he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or of ſuch obedience, which they profeſſed to the Apoſtolical Sea, ſo long as contrary to the priviledges thereof, he detained the Prelates in Priſon; and that in caſe he expected abſolution, he was to ſeek it with tears, and by a Perſon expreſs, and employed to no other purpoſe, and that there ought to be a Seſſion of Prelates thereupon,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50681:327"/>
to conſider, whether ſuch repentance were real, and unfeigned.</q>
And at laſt concluded with theſe ſharp words.
<q>You, ſaid he, think you have to do with ſome poor ſimple Frier, that is unacquainted with Men, and the World; but you ſhall find, that you have to do with <hi>Sixtus,</hi> who is ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend blood in defence of the Dignity of the Holy See.</q>
After which he diſmiſſed the two Ambaſſadours, and the next day called a Conſiſtory, in which he appeared with a countenance full of Choler which boiled in his breaſt; and then began to exclaim againſt his Legat <hi>Moroſini</hi> reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at <hi>Paris,</hi> as if he had conſented to the death of the Cardinal, or at leaſt might have prevented both that and the impriſonment of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, in caſe he had vigorouſly appeared againſt ſuch indirect Counſels: In the next place he railed againſt ſome Cardinals, who had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to excuſe the murther which the King had committed; wondering that Cardinals ſhould ſo little eſteem their Dignity, and degree, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſanctity of their purple to be profaned, by the unhallowed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences of an uſurped juriſdiction. As to us (ſaid he) it concerns little what affronts are put on the Cardinals dignity, but we are ſure, that it is of a high conſequence to you: for we cannot believe, that you would readily conſent to be diſpoiled of their Authority, your liberties, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, and other priviledges with which you are adorned: of which you will certainly be, if this murther of a Cardinal be connived at, or paſſed by without any reſentment. We therefore are reſolved to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our duty, and do that which God, and his Laws require at Our hands: and if from thence, as you may poſſibly object, ill conſequences enſue to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> we ſhall remain acquitted in the ſight of God; for juſtice muſt be done, though the World ſhould be ruined, and diſſolved thereby.</p>
               <p>The Cardinals remaining all ſilent, none daring to make a Reply. The Pope proceeded, and ſaid: We ſhall depute a Congregation of Cardinals to examine this caſe, and ſearch farther into this matter, and accordingly the perſons nominated were <hi>Anthony Sorbellone,</hi> the Arch bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Santa Severina, Facchinetto, Lancilotto, Saſtagna</hi> and others; the which Deputation was now the common Diſcourſe, and filled all the World with high expectation of the ſucceſs, and iſſue thereof.</p>
               <p>The King being informed of theſe proceedings, redoubled his Guards, and cautions in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which place he diſpatched the Biſhop of <hi>Mans,</hi> a perſon of ſingular probity, and eloquence to make his defence: and having received his Inſtructions, and being fully informed of all the reaſons, and arguments which might be produced in behalf of the King, he arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> where having firſt conſulted the Ambaſſadours, he was with them admitted unto Audience with the Pope: to whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with moſt profound humility to argue and plead: That the King had not incurred the puniſhment of any Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure, having in no manner violated, or infringed the Liberties, or Immunities of the Church. For that the Cardinal having been found guilty of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the King, was by the fundamental Laws, and conſtitutions of <hi>France,</hi> ſubjected to the Secular Power: and in regard he was a Peer of that Realm, his Cauſe was more immediately triable in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris,</hi> and in a grand Aſſembly of all the Princes, and Officers of the Crown; ſo that if the King had treſpaſſed againſt any Laws, it was againſt the priviledges of his own Parliaments, and not againſt the

juriſdiction of the Eccleſiaſtical State. In the next place he argued, that a King of <hi>France</hi> according to the priviledges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church could not incur the Cenſure of Excommunication.</p>
               <p>But theſe Arguments, and ways of reaſonings were in no wiſe pleaſing to the humour of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> being againſt the Idea, and Scheme that he had figured to himſelf of the Power of the Church and Keys: but rather ſerved to inflame his paſſion, and therefore ſetting aſide all thoſe Arguments, as not worth an Anſwer, he declared, and ſentenced, That in caſe within a certain time limited, the King did not free, and ſet at liberty the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lions:</hi> and that in caſe within the ſpace of ſixty days after ſuch releaſement, the aſſurance thereof were not intimated to himſelf and the Apoſtolical See, by writings under the King's own hand, and the Royal Signet, That then in ſuch caſe the King remained actually Excommunicated, and incurred all the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, as expreſſed in the Sacred Canons, and Conſtitutions of the Church. Farther, The Pope cited the King to appear at <hi>Rome</hi> either in perſon, or by his Proxy within the ſpace of ſixty days after intimation of theſe Summons ſhould be given him; to render an account, and to give anſwer to the accuſation charged upon him, for having murthered the Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and impriſoned the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lions:</hi> and for default of ſuch appearance, that then the King did actually incur the pain of Excommunication, from which he could not be abſolved by any other perſon whatſoever, than onely by the Pope himſelf, unleſs at the point of death; nor then neither, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon a confident, and faithful aſſurance and Vows to act, and obey all matters and Injunctions whatſoever which ſhould be enjoyned, and commanded by the Holy Church.</p>
               <p>Two Months, and ſome few days after the Pope had iſſued out this Excommunication; it happened, that the King being at the Head of a great Army near St. <hi>Clou</hi> about two Leagues from <hi>Paris</hi> was on the firſt day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1589. ſtabbed in the Belly by a <hi>Dominican</hi> Frier, who was a youth of about twenty three years of age: and with him ended his quarrel with the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1589.</note>Such being the fate of <hi>Henry</hi> III. the news thereof flew ſpeedily to <hi>Rome,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cauſed a report to be ſpread: that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> were reduced to a mean, and a low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and almoſt deſperate; and that not onely thoſe of the League, but alſo the whole Kingdom had declared the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon</hi> to be King by the name of <hi>Charles</hi> XI. Upon this grand Criſis of Affairs, the Pope reſolved to diſpeed Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> in quality of his Legat into <hi>France</hi> with a numerous train of Prelats famous for their Wiſdom, and Learning, intending to furniſh him with the ſum of a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Piſtols to defray the charge, and pomp of his ſublime Character.</p>
               <p>Whileſt things were thus preparing, Advices came from the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> that <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Vandoſme</hi> King of <hi>Navarre</hi> having been victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in many bloody Battels, was acknowledged by all the Nobility to be the true, and lawful King of <hi>France:</hi> and that he, (namely the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg</hi>) was deſigned Ambaſſadour by the ſaid Nobility unto his Holineſs, to inform him of the reaſons, which moved them to ſuch an acknowledgment, and to demand his Counſel and direction, as the common Father, how, and in what manner they might apply ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50681:328"/>
as might tend to a happy, and a well grounded peace. The Pope diſcovering hereby, that the Agents of the League had falſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the ſtate of Affairs to him, immediately diſpatched a Letter in anſwer to the Duke of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> acquainting him, that his Perſon ſhould be welcome at <hi>Rome</hi> and civilly treated; together with an other to the Nobility of <hi>France</hi> in the Camp of <hi>Navarre,</hi> exhorting them to remain firm and conſtant to the Catholick Religion; adding, that as to the perſon of the King, it was indifferent to him, who it was that reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, provided, he were a true Son of the Church, and ſuch as the Nobility deſired.</p>
               <p>And now the Legat being upon departure, the Pope altered many particulars of his former Inſtructions, and expreſly warned him to keep, as much as was poſſible, an even, and ſteady hand in all the pretenſions of Secular Princes; but that he ſhould be ſure always to incline towards the ſide of the Church, and Religion: that he ſhould not ſhew himſelf an open Enemy to the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> until his caſe was deſperate, and paſt all hopes of being reclaimed to the Church; but that ſo ſoon as he found him wavering, he ſhould then encourage him; but ſtand a Neuter, until he profeſſed himſelf a true Convert, and from that time to declare for his Perſon, and Intereſt.</p>
               <p>But the Legat not well obſerving theſe Rules, but running quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in favour of the League, and making his aboad at <hi>Paris,</hi> which had declared it ſelf againſt the King of <hi>Navarre</hi>; did greatly incur the diſpleaſure of the Pope, who not approving his Negotiations, gave a ſtop to thoſe ſums of Money which he had deſigned for him.</p>
               <p>In ſhort therefore this deportment which the Pope uſed towards <hi>Henry,</hi> did greatly contribute towards his eſtabliſhment: for the World obſerving, that ſo wiſe a perſon as the Pope, profeſſing no other quarrel to him, than onely on the ſcore of Religion; and that this ſcruple being removed, he was ready to ſide with him againſt all other Intereſts; and that he had induced the wiſe, and politick Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg him for King of <hi>France:</hi> there is no doubt, but that theſe favourable appearances did bring great reputation to the Arms of <hi>Henry,</hi> and much facilitated his aſcent to the Crown.</p>
               <p>Having in this manner laid down the Methods, and ways of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in Secular Affairs, and with forein Princes; let us now before we conclude the Life of this great Man, return to the treatment which he exerciſed towards his own People, and the rules he obſerved in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and nouriſhment of his own natural Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtus</hi> having now for five years obſerved many things relating to Government: nothing appeared more extravagant than the gallantry which people uſed in their Clothing; which was become ſo exceſſive, that for the regulation thereof, he conſtituted Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> to be the Reformer; by whoſe care, and wiſdom ſuch ſumptuary Laws were enacted, as reduced all perſons into a modeſty of dreſs, and habit; which being impoſed with ſevere penalties on the Tranſgreſſour, which <hi>Sixtus</hi> would never remit, all the Rules were obſerved and obeyed, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of this Pope, who did not ſupervive for many Months after.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable that this <hi>Sixtus,</hi> when he was a Frier, and a Cardinal, and not incumbred with a load of buſineſs, was very temperate, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50681:329"/>
abſtemious in his Diet: but being made Pope and burdened with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe application of mind to buſineſs, he ſeemed to want greater nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to keep up his ſpirits, which otherwiſe might have ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of Affairs; and therefore did eat much, and drink often of divers ſorts of delicious and exquiſite Wines, and would often ſit two or three hours at Meals diſcourſing of Theological, and political Subjects: howſoever his Diet was ordinary, and courſe, and his Table as frugal, as of any Pope that ever preceded him. He ſlept little, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his mind always intent to Studies, or buſineſſes, giving Audiences to forein Ambaſſadours, or hearing the Conſults, and Advices of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, or adminiſtring Juſtice, ſo that he was never obſerved to be idle, or at leiſure.</p>
               <p>He was ever chiding in a clamorous manner with his Servants, and yet he loved them, preferring many of them to high degrees, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, having made three of them Cardinals, and Biſhops beſides <hi>Caſtruccio Ardas</hi>; as he was forward to advance thoſe who had merited well from him, ſo he was rigorous and ſevere againſt any, who offended either out of negligence, or malice: An example of which, he ſhewed in the condemnation of <hi>Bellochio</hi> his Cup-bearer, to the Gallies, for having affixed the <hi>Annulus Piſcatorius,</hi> or the Pope's Seal to a certain writing, which <hi>Sixtus</hi> had refuſed to paſs; nor could he be diſſuaded by all the Intreaties which the Friends of <hi>Bellochio</hi> uſed, and being caſt into the Gallies, he died miſerably in two Months time of his diſgrace, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.</p>
               <p>He was extreamly tender and affectionate to his own Kindred and Relations, and in an eſpecial manner to his Siſter <hi>Camilla,</hi> one of whoſe Grandſons by a Daughter, a youth very young he raiſed to be a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in the firſt Month that he was made Pope, who ſo well improved himſelf by time, in the dexterous management of all Affairs, that he became ſo very uſeful to his Uncle the Pope, that he beſtowed a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue upon him of an hundred thouſand Crowns of yearly Rent. The Palace of <hi>Montalto</hi> is to this day to be ſeen at <hi>Rome</hi> rarely furniſhed, and famous for the abundance of rare Pictures, Statues, and Urns, and the Garden one of the beſt in all <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was infinitely covetous, and contriving for Money, for raiſing of which he laid Taxes on thoſe things which were never before charged, and ſold thoſe Offices, which were never until his time ſet to ſale; ſo that he advanced the Papal Revenue to above ſix hundred thouſand Crowns a year, above the ordinary Income: and in the firſt year of his Reign, he laid up a million of Gold in the Caſtle of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this Money ſhould never be employed in any thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, unleſs it were towards maintenance of a War for recovery of the Holy Land. In the third year alſo of his Pontificate, he laid up another million to the ſame end and purpoſe, ſwearing himſelf never to make uſe of the ſame, but for that War, or for ſome other War in defence of the Church againſt Infidels, or Hereticks; and this Oath of his, he would have all Popes obliged to conſerve, and keep inviolate. And that he might the better accumulate Wealth in this nature, as he was ſparing in his Diet, ſo he was alſo in his Clothing, cauſing his very Shirts to be patched before he would give them to his Servants: and beſides theſe two millions, he laid up three other in the ſame Caſtle; ſo that at his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50681:329"/>
death five millions were found of his hoard, and heaps. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this Riches, which he had ſpared, he had been moſt profuſe in his publick Buildings, and magnificent in Noble Structures, Aqueducts, and other things of common uſe, and benefit; and beſides all this, he employed a ſtock of two hundred thouſand Crowns to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain plenty in <hi>Rome,</hi> during the times of ſcarcity and famine in other parts of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ordained that the number of Cardinals ſhould not exceed ſeventy in all, amongſt which four at leaſt ought to be Doctors in Divinity, choſen out of the ſeveral Orders of Friers as well <hi>Mendicants</hi> as <hi>Regulars</hi>: and that Cardinals ſhould never be ordained, but in the <hi>Ember Week</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> as had been obſerved from the time of <hi>Clement</hi> I. though in the promotions of Cardinal <hi>Allen,</hi> and <hi>Moroſini</hi> he himſelf tranſgreſſed that Rule: and created in his time thirty three Cardinals.</p>
               <p>For more ſpeedy deciſion of matters of Law, and that Suits might not ſpin out into many years, he erected a Court of Conſcience, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of wiſe and godly Men, and ſuch as feared God. He enacted that Adultery ſhould be puniſhed with Death; and prohibited judicial A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology.</p>
               <p>About four Months before his death, he began to find himſelf indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, and complained of an illneſs in his Head; of which diſtemper and of the nature of his Diſeaſe he often diſcourſed with much reaſon according to the Rules of <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi>; howſoever during the time of this indiſpoſition, he omitted nothing of his buſineſs, and ate and drank of ſuch Meats, and Liquors, as are uſual for Men of the beſt health; having often in his Mouth the ſaying of <hi>Flavius Veſpatian</hi> the Emperor, <hi>That a Prince ought to die on his feet, and in action,</hi> ſignifying that a Prince ought to die in the work of his Vocation. But being more grievouſly feiſed by a malignant Fever on the twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1590. on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of the ſame Month in the Evening he died, being in the ſeventieth year of his Age, having governed the Papal Sea five years, four months, and three days. The Night after, his Body was carried in a Hearſe to the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> near the <hi>Vatican,</hi> for he died at his Palace of <hi>Monte Cavallo</hi>; from whence Cardinal <hi>Montalto</hi> cauſed it to be tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſolemn and Princely equipage to a Chappel which <hi>Sixtus</hi> had built adjoyning to the Church of <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore.</hi> After whoſe death the Sea was vacant eighteen days.</p>

At his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was made Counſellour of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical State, and aſſumed into the number of Prelats of the Office of the Inquiſition; in which Employments he continued until the year 1583. when he was created Cardinal by the ſaid <hi>Gregory</hi> with the Title of Saint <hi>Marcellus</hi> at a promotion of nineteen Cardinals, and ſoon after he was ſent Legat to <hi>Bologna.</hi> He was alſo held in great eſteem by <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> V. and entruſted by him in the management of the moſt important Affairs both in Church and State; and by him judged the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable perſon to ſucceed him in the Papal Chair; the which he expreſſed one day, when contriving in what manner to enlarge the Street from <hi>Santa Croce</hi> to <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> and thence how it might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in a direct line to <hi>Santa Maria del popolo,</hi> he turned about to Cardinal Saint <hi>Marcellus,</hi> and told him, That to finiſh that work, would belong to him; meaning, that the ſucceſſion being his, it would apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to him to compleat what he had happily begun.</p>
               <p>Nor was it onely the Opinion of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> that Cardinal <hi>Marcellus</hi> was to be his Succeſſour; but the common Voice, and rumour of the people fixed the Papal Dignity upon him; the which accordingly ſucceeded: for ſo ſoon as <hi>Sixtus</hi> was dead, and the uſual Obſequies of his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſolemnized; the Cardinals to the number of fifty four on the 7th. of <hi>September</hi> 1590. entred the <hi>Conclave,</hi> where a very great party la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured much for the election of Cardinal <hi>Colonna</hi>; who though he were a perſon of merit and worth, yet he was ſo highly oppoſed by a contrary faction; that both parties being intrigued in difficulties, did, as it were by mutual conſent concur in their ſuffrages for Cardinal St. <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who was a perſon without exception, and grateful both to Princes, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and People; for no ſooner was the Scrutiny begun, than all things ſo appeared in his favour, that on the 14th. of <hi>September</hi> at Night, the Cardinals were aſſured of the perſon, on whom the Election ſhould fall; more Votes appearing for him than the Complement requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; howſoever, though the Election was deferred until the next day at Noon; yet ſo unanimous, and conſtant was every perſon to his Vote, that the delay of time produced no alteration: ſo that on <hi>Saturday</hi> the 15th, he was with common conſent declared Pope.

               <p>So ſoon as he was promoted to this Dignity, he made large Preſents to many of the Cardinals, giving a thouſand Crowns to each, telling them, that it was to defray the charges they had been at, during the long time they had reſided in the <hi>Conclave.</hi> He beſtowed alſo great ſums to pious uſes: and ordered that the domeſtick Servants of his Family ſhould be clothed in new and rich Habits: He provided againſt the ſcarcity, and dearneſs of Corn and other proviſions; and reſtored thoſe <hi>Romans</hi> to their Places, and Offices which <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. had taken from them. Howſoever the day but one after he was choſen, finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf indiſpoſed, he refuſed to give Audience either to Cardinals, or to the Ambaſſadours of Princes; yet notwithſtanding on the 18th. of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> being the Feaſt of the conception of our Lady, he forced himſelf in deſpight of his diſtemper to paſs all the Ceremonies of his Coronation,

and on the 13th. to take ſolemn poſſeſſion of the Papal Chair at the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi>; all the ſtreets through which he paſſed were hung with Tapiſtry, and other Ornaments, and thronged with people to receive his Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; at which great honours, though he was obſerve;d to ſmile, and carry a countenance not becoming the gravity of a Pope, yet he would often praiſe God, and ſay, <hi>Lord, I thank thee, that with all theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and worſhip, thou haſt not ſuffered the heart of thy ſervant to be puffed up, or tranſported with worldly glory.</hi> And for the greater ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this Proceſſion, the People of <hi>Rome</hi> erected a triumphal Arch, with this Inſcription,

               <p>On the 6th. of <hi>March</hi> following he created ſix Cardinals; and a ſhort time afterwards he made his Nephew Count <hi>Sfrondati</hi> Duke of <hi>Mont-Marcian,</hi> and General of the Forces of the Church, ſending him into <hi>France</hi> with an Army for aſſiſtance of the League, in which War he ſpent five hundred thouſand Crowns of Gold.

               <p>In the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Inveſtiture into the Dukedom from the hands of the Pope; where he was received with great pomp, and honour, and his Table, and other Charges defrayed at the expence of the Pope.</p>

Pius</hi> IV. created him Biſhop of <hi>Nicaſtro</hi> a City in <hi>Calabria,</hi> and in the year 1561. employed him at the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> In the year 1566. <hi>Pius</hi> V. delegated him his Nuntio at <hi>Venice,</hi> where he was a ſucceſsful Inſtrument in making a League, and confederacy between the Pope, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> againſt the <hi>Turk.

               <p>The firſt thing he did after his Election, and which he was ſo ready to perform without loſs of time, that even then, when he was veſting himſelf in his Pontifical Habit, he ſigned the <hi>Bolle, De non alienandis bonis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae</hi>; and then declared with words proceeding from the depth of his heart, that he was reſolved to provide for the afflicted people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and contrive ſome effectual means to relieve the neceſſities of the City, which laboured almoſt under a Famine, or ſcarcity of Bread: To which end he ſummoned a Congregation, and commanded that the Barons of

               </p>
               <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the ſecond of <hi>November</hi> he was Crowned, but not on the ſtairs aſcending to St. <hi>Peters,</hi> but in a little Apartment which looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe ſtairs, by which means a thouſand Crowns were ſaved of the expence: the next day he held the firſt Conſiſtory, at which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned his hearty thanks to the Cardinals for favouring his Election, propoſing ſeveral things which he eſteemed convenient for conſervation of the Eccleſiaſtical State; amongſt which he gave them to underſtand, how neceſſary it was to keep always a conſiderable ſum of Money in the Treaſury, as a reſerve at all times to ſupply the neceſſities, and emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the Church: the which had been an antient practice in the Republick of <hi>Rome,</hi> where as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, they ever reſerved a ſecret Treaſure diſtinct from their running Caſh, never to be uſed, but then only, when the ultimate exigencies of State required it.</p>
               <p>In the next place, he wrote Epiſtles to all Patriarchs, Arch-biſhops, and Primates, giving them advice of his promotion to the Papal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, exhorting them within their reſpective Juriſdictions to make Prayers for him, that God would inſpire him in ſuch manner with his heavenly grace, as might enable him to ſupport the great, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant burthen of Eccleſiaſtical Government.</p>
               <p>The 29th. of this Month of <hi>November,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> to do him homage, and was received with a chearful welcome, being lodged in the Pope's Palace, in the Apartment belonging to his Nephews.</p>
               <p>On the 11th. of <hi>November</hi> he iſſued forth a regulation of the prices of all Proviſions, which were mounted to an exceſſive rate: On the 18th. he created two Cardinals, namely <hi>Segas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Fachinetti</hi> his great Nephew, whom he alſo conſtituted Referendary of both the Seals.</p>
               <p>On the 21th. he began to find himſelf indiſpoſed in his health, which encreaſing to a high degree did on the 23th. give indications of a malignant Fever, which in eight days time put an end to his life, and dying on the 29th. of <hi>December</hi> 1591, his Body was buried in the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> having reigned only two Months: and the Sea was vacant a month, and a day.

               <p>The Funeral Obſequies of <hi>Innocent</hi> being performed, the Cardinals having celebrated the Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt, and heard an Oration pronounced by the Biſhop of <hi>Traw de eligendo Summo Pontifice,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the <hi>Conclave</hi> on the 10th of <hi>January</hi> to the number of fifty two, ſinging the Hymn of <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus.</hi>

this aſſent from the mouth of others: told him, That his conſent could not be recorded from the words of others, but onely from his own; wherefore being thus urged, he with abundance of tears expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this manner:
<q>O Lord God, who ſeeſt the hearts of all Men, and from whom no ſecrets are hid, and knoweſt what is preſent, and what is to come; if this Election which thou haſt made of me, to be thy Vicar on Earth, ſhall not be to thy glory, and ſervice, and good of thy faithful people, Grant, I beſeech Thee, that my Tongue may cleave to the root of my Mouth, <hi>

               </p>
               <p>And thus being, as accuſtomary, veſted in his Habit, and placed in the Chair, he was with great joy of all the Cardinals adored by them; calling himſelf by the name of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. he was afterwards condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to St. <hi>Peters,</hi> where he was met by the Canons, ſinging the uſual <hi>Antiphona: Ecce Sacerdos Magnus, qui in diebus ſuis placuit Deo, &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus eſt Juſtus.</hi>

               <p>Howſoever the Wars between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> ſtill continuing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any probable appearance of accommodation, the <hi>Turk</hi> availed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of thoſe unhappy diviſions; and forced the Emperor to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Raab</hi>; and ſhamefully cauſed the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> to retreat from <hi>Temeſwar,</hi> and being victorious in all parts of <hi>Hungary,</hi> threatned to enter <hi>Germany</hi> by force of Arms: with which the Pope being greatly alarm'd, and fearing the ſucceſs of the common Enemy of Chriſtendom, bended all his thoughts towards making a Peace between <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which he hoped to effect in that juncture of time, when the circumſtances of Chriſtendom made it almoſt neceſſary to put an end unto the War: In this grand Affair he employed Cardinal <hi>Alexander de Medicis,</hi> (who was afterwards his Succeſſour) to be his Legat to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> IV. of <hi>France,</hi> and by his Nuntio who reſided with <hi>Philip</hi> II. in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> he uſed many inſtances, and warm Exhortations, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading both of them that laying aſide the hatred, and animoſities which were between them, they would ſeriouſly apply themſelves to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſuch Conditions, which might produce Amity and a Chriſtian peace between them, that ſo they might join in a League againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> who was now victorious, and breathed out ruin, and deſtruction to all Chriſtendom: but becauſe theſe two Princes were high ſpirited, and haughty, as not to be the firſt to condeſcend, and ask a peace, the General of the <hi>Cordelier</hi> Friers was employed by the Pope, to carry the Offers, and propoſals of mediation between one, and the other, in which he had ſuch ſucceſs, that labouring with the Legat, and Monſieur <hi>de Sillery,</hi> who was aftewards made Chancellour of <hi>France,</hi> they agreed at
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:50681:334"/>
St. <hi>Quintin</hi> on the moſt difficult, and diſputable Points and Conditions, which were afterwards perfected, and concluded at <hi>Vervins</hi> in the year 1598.</p>
               <p>But that which had like to have interrupted and ſpoiled all this Treaty, was the reſtitution of the Marquiſat of <hi>Salluces,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> King demanded of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>: but leſt this pretenſion ſhould fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and defeat the former Agreement, the King was contented to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Pope ſole Arbitrator and Judg of this difference, promiſing to ſtand to his Umpirage and Award, provided, that his Sentence were publiſhed in one year after the Date of this preſent Peace. But this Peace did not produce that union of Arms againſt the common Enemy, as the Pope expected; the Kings reſolving to make uſe of this Peace, for the quiet, and repoſe of their Subjects; and therefore taking no notice of any preparations againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> they diſpatched their reſpective Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Pope, freighted with Salutes and Thanks for the good Offices he had performed towards the happy eſtabliſhment, and concluſion of a Peace.</p>
               <p>But before this Peace was agreed in the Month of <hi>October</hi> 1599. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo d' Eſte</hi> the ſecond of that Name Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> died without iſſue Male, by which the City of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and the Territory thereunto belonging devolved to the Papal Chair, which the Pope made known to the Cardinals in a full Conſiſtory; with his Claim thereunto, according to antient Articles agreed between the Anceſtors of the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> and the Sea of <hi>Rome:</hi> But news coming afterwards that <hi>Ceſare d' Eſte</hi> Baſtard brother of the Duke deceaſed, had made ſeiſure, and taken poſſeſſion of the Dukedom by vertue of his Brother's Teſtament, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to defend his Title thereunto by force of Arms; the Pope was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled, and incenſed, and immediately gave Orders to raiſe an Army of twenty five thouſand Foot and three thouſand Horſe, to march under the Command of his Nephew Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandino</hi>; (<hi>John Francis Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobrandino,</hi> being, as we have ſaid, at that time in <hi>Hungary</hi>) and to make theſe temporal Arms the more available, he accompanied them with the Spiritual Artillery of Excommunication, which he cauſed to be thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and affixed in all the publick places of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> The Cardinal being proud of the honour to be ſo great a General, uſed ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in raiſing and providing his Army, that in leſs than two Months after his departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> he had compleated his Leavies, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his general Rendezvouz at <hi>Rimini.</hi> With the unexpected news of this ſpeedy diſpatch, <hi>Ceſare d' Eſte</hi> was much ſurprized, and being now in great fear, and doubt of his ſucceſs, began to conſult of what moderate, and reaſonable propoſitions he might offer unto the Pope: wherefore he deſired his Friends at <hi>Rome</hi> to intercede for him, and by their hands offered many, and various expedients, condeſcending every day to Conditions more favourable to the Pope than the former: but the Pope refuſing all other terms than thoſe, which made him Maſter of the City, and juriſdiction of <hi>Ferrara</hi>; he was at length obliged to yield thereunto, whereby that Dominion devolved to the Church, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery thereof was agreed by Articles ſigned at <hi>Faenza</hi>; of which when the Pope received advice, he ſang <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and rendered thanks pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to God; and with the general concurrence and Counſel of the Cardinals in a full Conſiſtory, he conſtituted Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandino</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:50681:335"/>
his Legat at <hi>Ferrara</hi>; giving him order to take poſſeſſion of the City; which about the end of <hi>February</hi> 1598.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1598.</note> was accordingly ſurrendered with all quietneſs, and peace, not ſo much as with a Sword drawn, or a Musket fired: before which time <hi>Don Ceſare</hi> retired to <hi>Reggio,</hi> and <hi>Modena,</hi> of which Cities he was ſhortly after created Duke by the Emperor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in the Government thereof, and alſo made Prince of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire. Afterwards the Pope reſolving to make a Journey to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> to ſettle, and eſtabliſh Affairs in his new Dominions, he cauſed on <hi>Sunday</hi> being the 12th. of <hi>April</hi> (according to the uſual Cuſtom, when Popes travel) the Sacrament of the Altar to be carried the day before his departure; and then the next day after Maſs, laying his Veſtments aſide, and clothing himſelf with his ſhorter Garments, the <hi>Antiphona</hi> was ſung: <hi>In viam pacis,</hi> with other ſhort Prayers for the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this Journey: and then mounting into his Horſe-litter he was accompanied to the Gate of the City by the Cardinals, where turning towards them he gave them his Benediction, and proceeded on his way, in this order. Firſt, after the Baggage, belonging to the Kitchin, the Horſe-litters, and Horſes appertaining to the Pope preceded, led by the Grooms of the Stables, clothed in red: next followed the Carriages with the Robes: next to them a Squadron of Light-Horſemen with four Trumpets before them, then the Pope's Family, with the Guard of <hi>Switzers</hi> on foot armed with Carbines, and Halberts: after followed the Governour of <hi>Rome,</hi> who accompanied his Holineſs as far as <hi>Ponte Molle,</hi> then went the Standard-bearer carrying a Crucifix, and immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him went the Pope in his Litter, and then followed the Cardinals <hi>Baronius, Arigoni, Monte,</hi> and St. <hi>Georgio</hi> on Mules with Ombrelles in in their hands, with a great number of other Prelats, ſome on Horſes, and others in Coaches: In this manner they travelled until <hi>Thurſday</hi> in the Evening, (being treated on the way by ſeveral Cardinals) when they arrived at <hi>Loretto,</hi> and there for Devotion, and for refreſhment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained until <hi>Sunday.</hi> When the Pope being on his departure, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi> a ſtately Croſs with ſix Silver Candleſticks, and two Baſes of maſſive Silver, with a thouſand Crowns in Money, and rich Veſtments with which the Pope was clothed, when he ſaid Maſs in that Chappel. Departing on <hi>Sunday</hi> from <hi>Loretto</hi>; they arrived that Evening at <hi>Ancona,</hi> where being received with Triumphant Arches and ſplendid entertainment, they were pleaſed to remain until the <hi>Friday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; during which time Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> arrived, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Pope with all the demonſtrations of kindneſs, and reſpect imaginable. On <hi>Thurſday</hi> being <hi>Aſcenſion day,</hi> and the day before the Pope's departure, the Sacrament of the Altar took its journey forward for <hi>Sinigag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> where the day following it arrived, as alſo did the Pope, being received by the Duke of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> with a ſumptuous, and ſplendid entertainment. From <hi>Sinigaglia</hi> they came to <hi>Fano,</hi> which being the City where the Pope was born, he was received with all demonſtrations of joy, and triumph; from thence they travelled to <hi>Peſaro,</hi> where the Duke of that place was not wanting in his reſpects and duty, and next day to <hi>Rimini</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> came to kiſs the feet of the Pope. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> they came to <hi>Ravexna,</hi> on <hi>Thurſday</hi> they arrived at the Church of St. <hi>George,</hi> not far diſtant from <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where was a ſtately Monaſtery poſſeſſed by Monks of the Order of <hi>Mount Olivet</hi>; the Sacrament being there arrived in the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:50681:335"/>
Morning, was met about a Mile diſtant from the Church, by the Clergy, and Religious of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> with all reverence, and devotion: where the Pope coming afterwards about an hour before Sun-ſetting, retired into the Convent, where his Lodgings were prepared, being the very ſame, in which <hi>Clement</hi> VII. had formerly been received: and here all things were prepared for the ſolemn <hi>Cavalcade,</hi> and entry into <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall not need to entertain the Reader with the Order and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous manner of this <hi>Cavalcade,</hi> as we have done of the Pope's Journey to this place; it is ſufficient to mention that the Entry into <hi>Ferrara</hi> was truly Royal, and Magnificent, and what might ſuit with the State, and glory of the greateſt Monarch of <hi>Europe.</hi> During the time of the Pope's reſidence in that place which was from the Months of <hi>April,</hi> until the middle of <hi>December</hi> following, ſeveral matters, and actions of importance ſucceeded: and particularly a contract of Marriage between four per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the ſame Name, Family, and bearing the ſame Eſcutcheons, and Arms; to wit, between <hi>Philip</hi> III. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> Siſter of the Arch-Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi>; and between the Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria Albert,</hi> late Cardinal, with the <hi>Infanta Iſabella Clara Eugenia</hi> Siſter of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>; the which moſt illuſtrious Perſons were joyned together by the hands of the Pope, during the time that the Pope reſided at <hi>Ferrara.</hi> For though in the life of <hi>Philip</hi> II. the Marriage was agreed between his Son, and the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> yet not being celebrated before his death, the conſummation thereof was deferred until the days of mourning for the deceaſed King were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed: which happening to be at the time, when Pope <hi>Clement</hi> was at <hi>Ferrara</hi>; it was thought fit, that the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> in her paſſage to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould take <hi>Ferrara</hi> in her way; which accordingly ſhe did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſplendidly treated by the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> as ſhe journied through their Dominions, and being conducted by the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> with a numerous train ſhe entered the City of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where ſhe was mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently received by the whole College of Cardinals, and lodged at the expences of the Pope. The ſame Evening that ſhe arrived, ſhe made her viſit to the Pope, and being admitted to his preſence, ſhe kiſſed his feet; and then his Holineſs vouchſafed to ariſe, and bow to her, and give her his bleſſing: after her the Arch-Dutcheſs preſented her ſelf; who was received with the like forms of bleſſing. On the <hi>Sunday</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, which was the day appointed for the Marriage, the Queen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared richly adorned like a Bride, and being conducted into the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, which was magnificently prepared, ſhe was there by the hand of the Pope eſpouſed to <hi>Philip</hi> the third King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Arch-Duke <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> repreſenting the perſon of the ſaid King; and then the Arch-Duke himſelf eſpouſed the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her ſtead, and in repreſentation of her perſon. After all which Ceremonies and Feſtivals were ended, at which there was a concourſe of almoſt all the great perſonages of <hi>Italy</hi>; the Queen took her journey by way of <hi>Mantoua</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> where ſhe was ſplendidly treated by that Duke. And the Pope alſo having reſided for the ſpace of eight Months at <hi>Ferrara</hi> to the great ſatisfaction of his new Subjects, who were not uſed to ſuch ſights, not to ſuch plenty of Mony, as the concourſe of ſuch great Perſonages had brought them, were high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed with the Eccleſiaſtical Government. At length the Pope in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:50681:336"/>
for <hi>Rome,</hi> departed from <hi>Ferrara</hi> with many expreſſions, and evidences of love, and affection towards his people, recommending them to the care of Cardinal St. <hi>Clement,</hi> whom he had made Governour of that City, and juriſdiction belonging to it. On the 20th. of <hi>December</hi> the Pope arrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> full of joy, and triumph for the happy acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of his new Dukedom; but this contentment was much allayed by the ſudden irruption of the <hi>Tybur,</hi> which overflowing all its banks, made ſuch an inundation as drowned all the City, and the Country round about; which was not onely of damage to many in their Eſtates and ruin of their Houſes; but divers perſons were drowned with all their ſubſtance, and Eſtate; never did <hi>Rome</hi> endure ſuch deſolation; for on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Day the Churches being filled with Water, there was neither Maſs nor Prayers, nor Prieſt, that was heard, or ſeen within thoſe Walls, and the Pope himſelf was forced to pray on the tops of the Hills of <hi>Rome:</hi> the poor that had ſaved themſelves, were yet in great miſery and want, and though ſpared by the Waters, might have periſhed by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine had not the charity of the Pope, and Cardinals adminiſtred a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to them; and herein eſpecially Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> was ſignally uſeful; for he viſited the Houſes of the poor in Boats, and ſupplied them with Bread and other Victuals, as their occaſions required. The like almoſt we read of in the Life of <hi>Adrian</hi> I.</p>
               <p>And now the year of 1599.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1599.</note> being entered, the Pope began to make preparations for the following year, which was called and appointed for the year of Jubilee; and in order thereunto he exhorted all Chriſtian Princes to peace, and unity, eſpecially his labours were more intent, and concerned for peace, and good correſpondence in <hi>Italy,</hi> inviting all Sovereign Princes by his Apoſtolical Letters (as they called them) to <hi>Rome</hi> to gain the Jubilee, promiſing all thoſe Bleſſings, Indulgences, and Pardons which are of as high moment, as the Salvation of their Souls. And becauſe I am of Opinion that the form of this general Letter may be curious, and pleaſing to the Reader, I have undertaken to tranſcribe the ſame, as tranſlated from the <hi>Latin,</hi> the words are theſe:
<q>
                     <hi>Clement</hi> the Biſhop, Servant of the Servants of God, to all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Chriſt, who ſhall read theſe preſent Letters, be Health, and the Apoſtolical Benediction.</q>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:50681:336"/>
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul:</hi> and becauſe that this Cuſtom ſhould not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by the World, as a vain, and ſuperſtitious rite of Gentiliſm, <hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. our Predeceſſour thought fit to confirm the ſame by his Apoſtolical Decree to all Ages: howſoever other Popes who were our Predeceſſours have undertaken to reduce the ſame to a ſhorter term of years.</p>
               <p>And indeed, it hath not without the Divine, and myſterious Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion been enacted, and decreed, that within the Age, and memory of Man, this great benefit of God to mankind ſhould be celebrated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred: who when like the Sun of Righteouſneſs, he aroſe from the Incloſures of the Virgins Womb, to beſtow eternal Salvation on all the World, he was pleaſed to appoint, that the remembrance of this Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſhould be celebrated in no other place, than this (of <hi>Rome</hi>) which is the Rock, and the receptacle of the Chriſtian Religion, where all the Subjects, as Sons of one Father, and Sheep of one Shepherd, reſort to the Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the firm Rock of Faith which ſhall never by the continued Courſe of Ages, nor variety of times be altered, or changed: that the World may ſee one Sheep-fold, and one Shepherd, and the true ſplendour of one Faith, and all the members thereof joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cemented together under one Head with the bonds of Love, and Charity: and laſtly, that they may ſee, with what unity in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the religious Solemnity of this year is obſerved in its due courſe which we may truly ſtile the Holy year. This year therefore we may reaſonably call the Holy year of Our Lord, and the acceptable year; becauſe that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who is the Author of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the Son of God, who was ſent by the Eternal Father in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Grace, and of the Holy Ghoſt, hath ſo named it:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>To heal the contrite in heart, to proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Priſon to them who are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of our Lord.</hi> And whereas we though unworthy, do ſit in the Seat of Chriſt upon Earth, and are ſtated in this ſublime Place, watching as a Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and a Guard Apoſtolical, do declare, publiſh and preach to all you who are the faithful in Chriſt this year of Jubilee; which though it be a year of repentance, yet it is alſo a year of Jubilee, and of ſpiritual joy and comfort.</p>

               <p>But the Pope was not ſo buſily employed in his preparations for the Jubilee, but that he attended to the deciſion of the Controverſie of the Marquiſat of <hi>Saluces,</hi> which (as we have ſaid) was at the late Treaty at <hi>Vervins</hi> put into his hands and power to be concluded, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the ſpace of one year: In order unto which the Preſident <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlard</hi> was diſpatched to <hi>Rome</hi> in behalf of the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Count <hi>d' Archonas</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and both met there about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this year 1599. the Cauſe being pleaded before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Pope, both Parties preſſed the Arguments ſo home in favour of the right of their reſpective matters: that the Pope eſteeming the Point difficult to be decided, required ſome longer time before he would undertake to paſs his judgment: and in the interim propoſed, that the Marquiſat
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:50681:337"/>
ſhould remain in his hands as a Depoſitary, and an indifferent perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both Parties. And though neither the King nor the Duke were well pleaſed with theſe delatory proceedings, yet the King was content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to allow two Months for ſuch determination; but the Duke, who had been poſſeſſed by the ſuggeſtions of his Miniſter at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope required to be the Depoſitary with deſign to beſtow the Marquiſat on one of his Nephews, conceived ſuch a jealouſie of the Pope's intentions, that he began to decline the Umpirage; which when the Pope under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood he with great indignation refuſed to interpoſe farther, reſolving neither to meddle with the Arbitration, nor the Depoſite. The King who knew well, in what manner to do right unto himſelf by his Sword, was not much concerned for the rejection which the Pope had made of the Arbitration: and the Duke being contented to have his Cauſe paſs by other formalities than that of the Conſiſtory, judged his right more ſecure, and more eaſily convincing by a perſonal Treaty with the King himſelf; which matter being now taken out of the hand of the Pope, we leave to the temporal determination of theſe Princes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to other matters more agreeable to this Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi> being in good favour, and correſpondence with <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. treated with him about obtaining a Divorce, or rather a diſſolution of marriage between him, and <hi>Margaret</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Valois</hi>; to which this Pope might perhaps be more inclinable and eaſie on ſome reflections he made on the ill conſequences which the delays of the like Divorce to <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. of <hi>England,</hi> produced to the Papal Power. The Cardinal <hi>d' Oſſac</hi> with the Preſident Monſieur <hi>de Silery,</hi> having Orders to proſecute this matter in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> repreſented to the Pope the ſtate of the marriage with Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> and that though the King their Maſter had ever ſince his converſion to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion entertained reverend, and obedient thoughts towards the Papal Sea, and might on ſcore of being the eldeſt Son of the Church expected more than ordinary favours, yet on conſideration of the Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this Marriage, he deſired nothing more than common juſtice. The Pope who was very deſirous to favour, and oblige the King, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the diſquiſition, and examination of the Marriage to the Cardinal <hi>Joyeuſe,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Modena,</hi> who was Nuntio for the Pope in <hi>France,</hi> and the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> whom he delegated to conſider of thoſe reaſons which were offered to invalidate the legality of the Marriage. In the mean time <hi>Henry</hi> treating a Contract of marriage with his Miſtris <hi>Gabriele d' Eſtrees,</hi> God diſpoſed otherwiſe of that intention; and the Delegates who were willing to comply with the deſires of the King, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the Marriage Null having been in the third degree of conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, by which both parties were ſet at liberty, and put in the ſame eſtate and condition as before their Matrimony. Of which the King having received information from his Ambaſſadour Monſieur <hi>de Sillery</hi> then reſiding at <hi>Rome,</hi> he immediately diſpatched the <hi>Sieur d' Alincourt</hi> Governour of <hi>Pontois,</hi> to render his humble thanks to the Pope for his obliging determination, and to demand his Counſel concerning the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance which he intended to make with the Houſe <hi>de Medicis,</hi> having placed his affections on the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> Niece to the Grand Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi> The <hi>Sieur de Sillery</hi> taking Poſt upon this Errand arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> the 6th. of <hi>February</hi> being <hi>Aſh-wedneſday</hi> in the year 1600.<note place="margin">

the year of Jubilee, which made that <hi>Lent</hi> the more Solemn, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, than that of common years: for it was commanded that Prayers of forty hours continuance ſhould be made in the Churches of the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits:</hi> the Pope himſelf with the Colledg of Cardinals began the firſt hour, and every hour afterwards was employed in Prayers, and ended with an Exhortation made by ſome Cardinal, or Learned Prelat.</p>
               <p>To gain the Indulgences of this Jubilee though many perſonages of great quality did reſort to <hi>Rome,</hi> yet none was of higher dignity than the Duke <hi>de Bar,</hi> who Incognito and with a ſmall train, and equipage tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled to <hi>Rome</hi> to gain a Diſpenſation for his Marriage, which he had ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated between himſelf, and the Princeſs <hi>Catharine</hi> the Onely Siſter of the <hi>French</hi> King: for having performed the ſame within the degrees of conſanguinity forbidden by the Church, the Biſhop of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and others had refuſed to admit him to the Sacrament, and Communion of the Church. Thus we ſee, whileſt the King ſues for a Divorce, the Duke deſires a confirmation, and diſpenſation of his Marriage and both were granted, though the ſame reaſons, and conſiderations were in both caſes; the ſame ground which might diſſolve the one might null the other, and the ſame ſalve might ſerve for both Cures: In ſhort, the Duke <hi>de Bar</hi> applyed himſelf with all the humility, and ſubmiſſion imaginable to the Papal Chair, and carrying with him the King's recommendatory Letters to the Cardinals <hi>Aldobrandino, Oſſac,</hi> and his Ambaſſadour, he obtained as much favour in his Cauſe as he could expect, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, in purſuance of the late Divorce, the <hi>Sieurs de Sillery,</hi> and <hi>Alincourt</hi> went to <hi>Florence</hi> to treat a new Marriage between the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Princeſs <hi>Mary de Medicis.</hi> As the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> received the honour of this Match with great readineſs, it being an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the grandeur of his Houſe; ſo the Pope to forward the ſame, contributed on his part a hundred thouſand Crowns with many Jewels by way of Dowry, or Portion, which was agreed to be ſix hundred thouſand Crowns in ready Mony. So ſoon as the Articles were ſigned, the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> publiſhed the intended Marriage; and the King to bring it to a conſummation, being then at <hi>Lions</hi> in order to his Journey to <hi>Grenoble</hi> deputed <hi>Bellegarde</hi> his Grand <hi>Eſcuyer</hi> with Commiſſion to the Grand Duke, to eſpouſe <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> in his name: and the Pope to have a farther hand in this work, deputed his Nephew Cardinal <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobrandino</hi> to be his Legat at <hi>Florence,</hi> and to be preſent at the Nuptials, which he accordingly performed, and beſtowed the Benediction in the Pope's Name.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal having performed this piece of ſervice haſtned away by order of the Pope to <hi>Tortona,</hi> there to find the Duke and ſtipulate with him the conditions of a firm Peace; for the King had already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced a War, and taken ſeveral places both in <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Breſſe.</hi> The Cardinal repreſenting before the Duke the danger, and inequality of a War with <hi>France,</hi> perſuaded him to reſign his pretenſions and intereſt to the Marquiſat of <hi>Saluſes</hi>; and having obtained this promiſe, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Lions,</hi> where managing this Affair with the King, a Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and publiſhed in the year 1601. on Conditions, that the Duke ſhould quit all claim to the Marquiſat of <hi>Saluces</hi> in exchange for <hi>Breſſe,</hi> and ſome other Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:50681:338"/>In the mean time the Queen embarqued at <hi>Ligorne</hi> with ſeventeen Gallies, arrived happily at <hi>Marſeille,</hi> and thence was conducted with great honour and pomp to <hi>Lions,</hi> where meeting with the King the marriage was conſummated, and the Nuptial Benediction given by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> the Pope's Legat before the great Altar of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church in the City of <hi>Lions.</hi> All theſe kindneſſes paſſed between the Pope, and the King; the Pope reſolved to make uſe of this good Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence to intercede in behalf of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> whoſe whole Order having for certain reaſons been baniſhed, and exterminated from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of <hi>France,</hi> was now at the inſtance and deſire of the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored again under certain Conditions to their poſſeſſions, and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in that Kingdom.</p>
               <p>And in regard the Emperor was at the ſame time hardly preſſed by the <hi>Turk,</hi> the Pope, as at other times furniſhed him with a hundred thouſand Crowns, which was a ſeaſonable Recruit and ſupply in thoſe exegencies of the Empire.</p>
               <p>And now it was about the year 1603.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King did greatly urge the Pope for a promotion of Cardinals, recommending ſeveral of his own Creatures, and Friends to that Dignity: And though the Pope was very deſirous to have reduced the Order of Cardinals to their ancient number, yet being overcome by the inſtances of ſome Friends, he beſtowed a Cardinals Cap on the Son of one of his Nephews, being a Youth of about fourteen or fifteen years of age; and ſuffering himſelf to be prevailed with by the paſſion of Princes, he created in this very year at leaſt eighteen Cardinals, amongſt which there were not above two <hi>French,</hi> and two <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The firſt which was found in this Liſt was <hi>Serafim Olivari</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who was originally of <hi>Italian</hi> extract, but born at <hi>Lions,</hi> and proved to be a Prelat of Incomparable parts, and Learning, being always educated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, and buſineſs; the Biſhop of <hi>Eureux</hi> was an other promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this Dignity, which were the two <hi>French</hi>-Men, who received this honour by the recommendations of their King: all the others were <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> unleſs the Biſhop of <hi>Cracovia</hi> who was a <hi>Polander,</hi> and <hi>Madrutio</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Trent,</hi> who was a <hi>German,</hi> and two <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobrandino</hi> preferred alſo his Secretary <hi>Erminio</hi> to this honour; and the Pope himſelf forced <hi>Anſelme Marzat</hi> a <hi>Capucin</hi> to accept the red Hat; which he had often refuſed, proteſting that ſuch preferments were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:50681:339"/>
the Rules, and a violation to the Orders of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> but the expreſs commandment of the Pope prevailing; he unwillingly, (or at leaſt ſeemed ſo) from the mere conſideration of obedience ſubmitted to the promotion.</p>
               <p>About this time three Queſtions were moved, and diſcuſſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> the firſt was managed by a notable Diſputant, and a great Sophiſter; his poſition was this: That it was not an eſſential, or a fundamental point of Faith, to believe that <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. was the true and lawful Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of St. <hi>Peter:</hi> it was a bold Theſis for that time, and place; for he was impriſoned for his impertinence, and it had coſt him dearer, had not the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour interceded for him. An other publiſhed an Opinion, That Confeſſions wrote in Letters and ſent by the Poſt, were as available, as thoſe, which were whiſpered into the Ear of the Prieſt. A third was about Grace, and Free-will, in ſuch manner as held, and maintained by <hi>Pelagius</hi>; which latter was debated in the preſence of the Pope and Cardinals but remained without determination, by reaſon of more important matters which at that time lay before the Conſiſtory.</p>
               <p>For then the Canonizing of <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> for a Saint was firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: and alſo the Deputies of the Clergy of the City of <hi>Milan</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves before the Pope, and Cardinals, deſiring that their antient Arch-biſhop <hi>Charles Borromeo</hi> might be canonized. Upon theſe two motions the Pope conſtituted a certain Committee of Cardinals to enquire into the ſanctity of the Lives, and of the Miracles which were done at the Invocation of the Names, and at the Sepulcres of theſe Saints.</p>
               <p>After which an Ambaſſadour was introduced into the Conſiſtory from the Emperor, repreſenting the many occaſions of advantage which were loſt in <hi>Hungary</hi> for want of Money to carry on the War; to which the Pope gave Anſwer, That his Coffers at the preſent were empty, but howſoever he would lay a Tax of decimation on the Clergy, whereby to ſupply the urgencies of the Emperor againſt the common Enemy.</p>
               <p>Thus did this Pope, (who in reality merited the name of a good Man) employ his whole time in the Conſiſtory, either deſigning to make peace between Chriſtian Princes, or to carrry on a War againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> who is the common Enemy of Chriſtians; and in theſe good works of Piety he inceſſantly laboured, being frequently in conſultation concerning the temporal, and ſpiritual Affairs in the Church; in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of which his fortune was to be aſſiſted with many wiſe, and able Cardinals, ſuch as <hi>Joyeuſe, Serafim Olivari,</hi> and <hi>Perron</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours, who amongſt ſeveral other matters adviſed him to take a Guard of <hi>Corſi,</hi> or Men of the Iſle of <hi>Corſica,</hi> who being quartered in ſeveral parts of the City might be ready to ſuppreſs the <hi>Banditi</hi> who began again to be troubleſom and to infeſt <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as other parts of <hi>Italy</hi>; from which time until the reign of <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. this Guard was maintained, when upon ſome Affronts, and violences offered to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, they were disbanded and diſmiſſed never afterwards to appear in <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>On the 10th. of <hi>April</hi> being <hi>Eaſter</hi> day he was ſolemnly Crowned, but the day of Proceſſion to St. <hi>John de Lateran</hi> where the Pope takes the poſſeſſion was deferred until the ſeventeenth inſtant, when the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines,</hi> and the ſeveral Orders of the City did endeavour to outvy each other in ſuch demonſtrations, as might evidence the ſatisfaction, and contentment they received by this Election: amongſt which the <hi>Florentines</hi> erected a Triumphal Arch with this Inſcription on the one ſide thereof:

But this joy, and contentment did not continue long; for the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wearied with the tedious length of theſe Ceremonies, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated with the Weather, and weight of his Veſtments took an extream cold which turned to a Fever, which encreaſing daily on him, he expired his laſt breath on the 25th. day after his Election, and in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his age; the ſame Evening his Body was carried to the Chappel of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and the next day being the 28th. of <hi>April</hi> to the Church of St. <hi>Peters,</hi> where according to the uſual cuſtom great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of people thronged to kiſs his feet.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>EO</hi> the Eleventh being deceaſed, the ſame Cardinals who had elected the preceding Pope to the number of ſixty one, entered the <hi>Conclave</hi> on the 8th of <hi>May,</hi> where the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the firſt Scrutiny was made; but without effect, by reaſon of the diverſity of Votes, and diviſions amongſt the Cardinals. <hi>Sauli</hi> was then propoſed, but excluded: <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was then next who in all probability might have carried the Prize, had not the Scrutiny been deferred, after the Pratica was made for him. <hi>Camerino,</hi> and <hi>Clemente</hi> were alſo put to the Votes, but excluded; only Cardinal <hi>Toſco</hi> had gained ſo great a Party, being aſſiſted by <hi>Aldobrandino, Montalto</hi> and others of the beſt Intereſt, that his Election had certainly been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, had not <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Farugio</hi> croſſed the matter, which cauſed a loud cry for <hi>Baronius,</hi> but by a like accident of contradiction, as well <hi>Baronius,</hi> as <hi>Toſco</hi> was excluded: at length after diverſity of Succeſſes Cardinal <hi>Borgheſe</hi> being nominated, ſuch unanimous conſent appeared in all the <hi>Conclave,</hi> that every one ſeemed to aſſent having no other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt him, than the ſmall number of his years, having ſcarce attained to the age of fifty three, but that ſcruple not availing, he was conducted to the Chappel of <hi>Paolino,</hi> where he was elected, and having veſted himſelf in his Pontifical garments was worſhiped as Pope on the 16th. of <hi>May,</hi> which being performed he took on himſelf the name of <hi>Paul.</hi> V.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Camillo,</hi> for ſo was his Chriſtian Name, was born at <hi>Rome,</hi> his Father was <hi>Antonio Borgheſe</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> but his Mother was a <hi>Roman</hi> Lady. His Studies were chiefly in the Civil Law, in which having taken his degree of Doctor he became ſo famous, that he was made Referendary both of one, and the other Signet. In the year 1588. he was conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Vice Legat of <hi>Bologna. Gregory</hi> IV. made him Auditor of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which is an Office that requires great dexterity, and experience in Affairs. <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. created him Cardinal with the title of St. <hi>Chru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſogono,</hi> and afterwards made him his Vicar, which is one of the four principal Dignities of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner he ſtill advanced in greatneſs and honour, until he came to the height of the Papal Dignity, ſeeming to have ariſen thereunto rather by the force of his own merits, and Virtue than by fortune, or the favour and recommendation of Friends or Patrons. On the 29th. of <hi>May</hi> being <hi>Whit-ſunday</hi> he was Crowned with all the uſual Ceremonies; and then he beſtowed freely his general Indulgences, exhorting all people to pray for the encreaſe of God's Church, the tranquillity and peace of the Chriſtian State, and extirpation of Hereſie. He abated, or took off ſome of the Taxes, which lay moſt heavy on the People, moderated the price of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions at <hi>Rome,</hi> and contrived a great abundance of all things neceſſary, or convenient for humane life. And to give ſome indication to the World of his magnificence, and generous Mind, he built a Chappel in the Church of <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> juſt oppoſite to that of <hi>Sixtus</hi> V.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:50681:341"/>
which he enriched, and adorned with Porphiry, and Marble, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed afterwards with a conſiderable Revenue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> V. being thus ſetled in the Papal Chair, and inveſted with all the Power attendant on that ſupreme degree, made it the ſcope, and chief end of all his deſigns, and Counſel to ſcrue up the Eccleſiaſtical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the ſublime pitch of greatneſs; or (to uſe his own words) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore <hi>it to that State from which his Predeceſſours, and particularly</hi> Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment VIII. <hi>had by their remiſsneſs, or want of care ſuffered it to elapſe, and decay.</hi> And indeed his own natural diſpoſition, and the courſe of his life ſeemed to have fitted him for ſuch a work as this; for having been educated a Lawyer, and made Auditor of the Chamber, whoſe title is, <hi>Sententiarum, &amp; cenſurarum intus, &amp; extra latarum univerſalis Executor,</hi> he made ſuch uſe of his Trade, that all the Popes his Predeceſſours, for above fifty years before, had not thundered out ſo many Briefs, Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and Excommunications, as he had done, in the ſpace onely of five years: In order to this deſign of advancing the Eccleſiaſtical Power, (to which all his thoughts were applyed) he conſtituted a new Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation at <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it was to contrive ways and means to amplifie, and enlarge the Authority, and Dominion of the Church: and all the Nuntios, or Miniſters which he ſent to Chriſtian Princes were all prepared, and compoſed of the ſame humour, having ſpecial Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to cry up the Vertue and ſacred force of the Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; amongſt theſe Champions none was more zealous than <hi>Oratio Mathei</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gierace,</hi> whom the Pope had made his Nuntio at <hi>Venice</hi>; where one day making a Speech before the <hi>Doge</hi> and Council; he had the impertinence, or rather the impudence to ſay, <hi>That Alms-deeds, and other works of Charity and Piety, and frequent Communion in the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the moſt ſublime works of Chriſtian devotion,</hi> ad nihilum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>were all nothing, unleſs they were attended with reſpect, and favour to the Eccleſiaſtical liberty and authority.</hi> To which he added: <hi>That the Pope had commanded him to perſiſt in this Opinion to the death, and accordingly he was reſolved to endure martyrdom, rather than be remiſs or cold in advancement of the Papal Authority.</hi> And theſe words he delivered with ſuch arrogance, and ſupercilious affectation, that he ſeemed to ſay, I am Pope in this place, and expect no Reply, or Conteſt, but onely O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>
               <p>Howſoever at firſt for ſeveral Months this deſign was not proſecuted with ſuch heat as the importance of the matter did require; for we muſt allow ſome abatement, and allay for the joy, and ſatisfaction which the Pope would take within himſelf for his late Atchievements: And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon farther thoughts, he judged it not convenient to erect the Congregation he deſigned; for that it would be a means to lay open, and diſcover his contrivances, and make Princes more jealous: a proof whereof was given by the Congregation, which was conſtituted for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Affairs of <hi>England</hi>; which ſerved onely to give better light and aim to King <hi>James</hi> than reigning, and to render him more watchful, and obſerving over all the actions, and deſigns of the Papiſts in <hi>England.</hi> And moreover, the Pope having paſſed ſome few days of joy after his Inauguration, was poſſeſſed with a melancholly cauſed by an hypocondriacal Fancy, that he ſhould ſpeedily depart this life, which gave ſome retardment for a while to the heat of his actions: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:50681:341"/>
the ground of his apprehenſion proceeded from a common report about <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Image of the Virgin of <hi>Subiaco</hi> had ſweated, which commonly fore-runs the death of Popes: alſo a <hi>Dutch</hi> Aſtrologer had predicted, that <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. ſhould die in <hi>March,</hi> and that after him <hi>Leo,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſucceed, and both Reign for a ſhort time. The thoughts hereof ſo diſturbed, and perplexed his mind, that for the ſpace of five Months he could not apply himſelf to any buſineſs of moment; until in the Month of <hi>September</hi> certain of his Friends being deſirous to cure this melancholly aſſembled all the Aſtrologers, and Diviners toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Houſe of the Pope's Brothers, where having had a Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they all concluded, that there had been certain black and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Influences which threatned the life of the Pope, but being now paſt and blown over, there remained nothing but chearful, and auſpitious Omens, which promiſed long life, and happineſs, and great ſucceſſes unto him.</p>
               <p>Thus being relieved of his Melancholly, his thoughts were at liberty to reaſſume the deſign to advance the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which his firſt beginning was to perſuade the King, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> might be received in <hi>France.</hi> In <hi>Spain</hi> he laboured to gain an exemption for the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> that they might be freed from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Tenths. At <hi>Naples</hi> he endeavoured to have had the Marqueſs of <hi>Morcone</hi> called the Regent of <hi>Ponte,</hi> ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning a Book-ſeller to the Gallies, for printing libellous Pamphlets, the which he pretending to belong to the Inquiſition, was an encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the Eccleſiaſtical Power, and therefore merited the Cenſure, and puniſhment of the Church. He alſo took away certain Rents, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices belonging to the religious Order of <hi>Malta,</hi> and conferred them on Cardinal <hi>Borgheſe,</hi> who was his Nephew by the Siſters ſide, called <hi>Scipio,</hi> of the Family of <hi>Caffarelli</hi> a youth of twenty three years of age. But theſe, and other matters of this nature made no great noiſe, and only ſerved to open the gate or way to particulars of greater importance, the which ſoon afterwards happened in two conſiderable Inſtances. The firſt related to the Republick of <hi>Luca,</hi> which obſerving that many of their Citizens having profeſſed the Proteſtant Religion were retired from their Habitations and Country, had in the times of former Popes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and interdicted them from all Commerce, or correſpondence with their fellow-Citizens: the which Act though well approved by the Pope to be in it ſelf both pious, and commendable, yet he pretended, that ſuch Act of Interdiction belonged to the Eccleſiaſtical, and not to the Civil Power; and therefore required that the ſame ſhould be cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and made void, that ſo place, and room might be opened for the Cenſure of the Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond related to the City of <hi>Genoua,</hi> where at the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg an Oratory or Chappel was ſet up for Chriſtian exerciſes, and here the Citizens of this Congregation agreed amongſt themſelves to favour none with their Votes at the Election of Magiſtrates, but ſuch as were entered and enrolled in this Confraternity. This reſolution being made known to the Supreme Rulers of the City, they immediately diſſolved the Congregation, not knowing what might be the ill effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch Sedition. This, and other matters of like nature were ill reſented by the Pope, as encroachments on the Eccleſiaſtical liberty;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:50681:342"/>
wherefore he commanded that ſuch Orders be reverſed, and if not, then he threatned them with Cenſures, and Excommunications.</p>
               <p>But the Pope began to deal more roundly with the State of <hi>Venice</hi>; for being very urgent with them to aſſiſt the Emperor with Money to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Wars againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> he exacted it in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as Kings, and Emperors require contributions from their Subjects; which though the <hi>Venetians</hi> could not digeſt without ſecret reſentments, yet their Anſwer was with much modeſty: <hi>That though the Senate would gladly contribute towards a War againſt the Turk, yet being at high charge, and expence to conſerve their own State, and ſecure themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe fears, and jealouſies which were given them by their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they could not apply their nerves and ſinews of War to any deſign, but what tended to their own ſecurity at home.</hi> This Anſwer ſeemed very ſtrange to the Pope, who had learned from the doctrine of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Caſuiſts, That Popes might lay any Tax or Impoſition on Chriſtian Princes, and require from them whatſoever they judged for the common good, and welfare of Chriſtendom. But the Pope did not think this ground to have ſufficient foundation, on which to build, and commence a quarrel, but rather on the matters, which did more neerly relate to the Intereſt of the Papal Sea.</p>
               <p>It was not long before an occaſion of this nature offered it ſelf by means of one <hi>Scipio Saraceno</hi> a Prebend of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> who had contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly torn off, and broken the Seals which the Magiſtrates had fixed on the Epiſcopal Chancery, during the vacancy of that Office: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe finding that he could not debauch a Lady of known Vertue, whom he tempted in the Churches, and Streets, and in all places where he could have any convenience to meet her; he became ſo enraged with luſt, and malice, that he beſmeared with filthineſs and tar the Gate, and front of her Houſe; which being a high affront, and diſgrace to the Lady, ſhe with the advice of her Friends cited this inſolent Prebend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court of Juſtice at <hi>Venice,</hi> who as readily and willingly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being encouraged and bolſtred up by the Biſhop of <hi>Citta Nuova,</hi> a perſon of great eſteem in <hi>Venice,</hi> and one who was Director of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of all the Nuntios and Papal Miniſters at that place. The Nuntio who was deſirous to obtain a licentious exemption of all Prieſts from the Secular Power, embraced the cauſe of the Prebendary with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs imaginable, and immediately diſpatched the news hereof to the Pope, and to the Biſhop of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> who was then at <hi>Rome</hi>; where after divers Conſultations, it was reſolved as an eſſential Point relating to the Eccleſiaſtical liberty, that the Cauſe of the Prebend ſhould be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and defended: and therefore the Pope who was glad of this occaſion to aſſert the Authority and Rites of the Churches, ſtormed, and raved with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadour, telling him, that he would not endure or ſuffer the impriſonment of an Eccleſiaſtical Perſon by the Precepts of a Secular Tribunal; nor would he admit that a Judg of temporal matters ſhould take cogniſance of any Cauſe, wherein a Prieſt, or Churchman was concerned. Of all which, the Ambaſſadour gave advice to the Senate.</p>
               <p>The Pope at an other Audience complained to the ſaid Ambaſſadour, that the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> had ſince the death of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. made a Statute of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> whereby Lay-perſons were forbidden, and reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:50681:342"/>
from bequeathing, or beſtowing their Eſtates on the Church; which Statute though it were founded on an old Law, yet the new one was more reſtrictive: but both of them being againſt the antient Canons, Councils, and Imperial Laws were in themſelves void, and null, being ſcandalous, and impious, in that they made the ſtate, and condition of Churchmen worſe than that of infamous perſons; and therefore thoſe who made theſe Laws did incur the Cenſures of the Church: in the like terms the Nuntio at <hi>Venice</hi> explained the mind of the Pope unto the Senate: and when the Ambaſſadours arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> to congratulate the Pope for his exaltation to that dignity, he could not refrain even before the Ceremony was ended, to make his reſentments, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of thoſe Laws made in derogation of the Rites, and immunities belonging to the Church. And thus we have laid down the true ſtate of the quarrel between the Pope, and the <hi>Venetians:</hi> to which we ſhall add a third Point, namely a Law made at <hi>Venice</hi> in the year 1603. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the building of Churches without conſent, and licenſe for it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from the Senate; which the Pope termed a piece of Hereſie.</p>
               <p>Theſe being the three Points in Controverſie, the Senate for anſwer thereunto commanded their Ambaſſadour to repreſent in their name unto his Holineſs; That the juſt Right, and Title they had to judg Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Perſons in Secular Cauſes was founded in the natural Power of the Supreme Prince, and confirmed by an uninterrupted courſe of a thouſand years, the which may be proved by the Pontifical Briefs extant in their publick <hi>Archives,</hi> or Records. That the Law of <hi>Mort-main,</hi> or Statute reſtraining Laymen from alienation of their Eſtates to the Church, was not onely enacted at <hi>Venice</hi> or peculiar to the Cities under that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, but exerciſed in other Chriſtian Kingdoms, and States; and that this Law was more conducing to the welfare of <hi>Venice,</hi> than to any other people; being that which could onely conſerve its Forces entire againſt the common Enemy of Chriſtendom, which would otherwiſe be enfeebled by thoſe daily Legacies, and Endowments which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed, and conferred on the Church.</p>
               <p>The Pope was ſo netled with this way of reaſoning, that he ſat all the time uneaſie in his Seat, ſhrugging his ſhoulders, and turning his head which intimated the unquietneſs of his mind. At length he replyed: That thoſe arguments were invalid, and of no force: for that there was no foundation to be made on the accuſtomed courſe of their Judicature, which was ſo much the worſe, by how much more they pretended An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. And as to the Briefs, there was no authentick Regiſter or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of them, but what was found at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the others were forged Copies, and cheats impoſed on the Clergy. And as to their Acts, and Ordinances, he was ſo well acquainted, and verſed in them, ſince the time of his youthful Studies; and that having paſſed the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of Vice-Legat, Auditor of the Chamber, and Vicar of the Pope, he was ſufficiently aſſured, that that Law could not ſtand, and that the old Act made in the year 1536. which takes from the Laiety a power of diſpoſing of their own private Eſtates, was in it ſelf void, and of no force, and a tyrannical impoſition on the Subject. That the Senate themſelves were ſo ſenſible of this injurious Law, that they were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to iſſue forth any Copies of it: and if in caſe a Law of this nature, were found in any other Country, it was eſtabliſhed by the Authority
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:50681:343"/>
and with the concurrence of the Popes; and then he concluded, that he was reſolved not to make a long work of it, for that in caſe he were not obeyed, he would make uſe of ſuch Remedies as he thought convenient, being ſo poſitive in this matter, and zealous for the Church, that he was ready to ſpill his blood in this righteous Cauſe, and in the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; That in caſe it were neceſſary to give a ſtop to the alienation of Lands, or a reſtraint of building Churches, he would always have been ready to have followed the ſentiments of the State, and to have concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in juſt cauſes with the deſires of the Secular Council: but as to the point of drawing the Clergy to the Secular Tribunals he would never admit, that ſuch as were his Subjects, ſhould be liable to the ſentence of an other Juriſdiction; this in fine was his reſolution on the three foregoing Caſes, in which he was reſolved to be obeyed, and make uſe of that Power which God had given him over all things, and over all Princes to depoſe them, and could command Legions of Angels to come to his aid and aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Senate having received theſe Informations from their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour did well weigh, and conſider the anger, and furious diſpleaſure of the Pope on the one ſide, and the publick liberty, and the neceſſity of upholding their Government on the other: and having put both theſe conſiderations into the balance, they returned this anſwer to the Pope's Nuntio, and wrote alſo to their Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> to this effect. That they could neither releaſe the Priſoners lawfully arreſted, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, or diſpence with thoſe Laws which were juſtly eſtabliſhed, leſt they ſhould violate that natural liberty which God had beſtowed on their Republick, and which had been conſerved for many hundreds of years by the wiſdom, and with the blood of their Anceſtours. For that to admit ſuch a breach into their Power, would breed ſuch confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in their Government, as could not but end in a dangerous Sedition. The which reſolution was ſo unanimous, and general that not one Vote in the Senate was diſſenting, and accordingly it was ſignified to the Nuntio, that ſo they might diſabuſe and take off the Pope from thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, which the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had promiſed, of making a diviſion, and Schiſm amongſt the Senators.</p>
               <p>But theſe reaſons made little impreſſion in the mind of the Pope, or did in the leaſt move him from proſecuting the violent courſe he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and accordingly he ordered two Briefs to be drawn up; one rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the two Laws, and the other to the two Priſoners; for beſides the Canon or Prebend whom we have formerly mentioned, the Abbot of <hi>Nerveſa</hi> was alſo apprehended by the Secular Juſtice. The Crimes laid to the charge of this Abbot were ſuch as were flagitious, and of a high nature, being accuſed of having exerciſed an unlimited tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny upon his Neighbours, and Tenants; that he had robbed, and taken away their goods at the prices he was pleaſed to ſet; that he lived in Whoredom, and committed Rapes on the Bodies of vertuous and chaſt Women; and that in order thereunto he uſed Magical Spells, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, and compounded ſubtle Poiſons, by which he had deſtroyed his own Brother who was an <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Frier, and with him his Servant; that by his Poiſons he had macerated the Body of his Father in ſuch manner, as had reduced him to the laſt extremity of life. That he had committed Inceſt with his own Siſter, and poiſoned her Maid, leſt his
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:50681:343"/>
Crime ſhould be detected by her; beſides many other Murthers, and wickedneſs of the deepeſt dye of which he was guilty: and this was the pretious Fellow, with his Comrade the Canon of <hi>Vicenza</hi> whom the Pope was ſo inſtant to defend and exempt from the Sentence of the Secular Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The Breviates (as we have ſaid) being wrote, and Sealed were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in this manner, <hi>Marino Grimano Duci, &amp; Reipub. Venetorum,</hi> and then diſpeeded with all ſecrecy by the Pope to his Nuntio at <hi>Venice:</hi> which when he had done he called a Conſiſtory of Cardinals, and then firſt publiſhed, and made known the whole matter to them, enlarging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſuch heat, and vehemence on every particular Point, as that he ſeemed impatient of any contradiction, not admitting any debate, or conſultation thereupon. The Cardinals not being uſed to this manner of treatment, who according to the antient conſtitution of Conſiſtories were not only reputed Counſellours, but Parties alſo in all matters of this moment, did murmure at this raſh and precipitate reſolution of the Pope: and having underſtood the reaſons of the Pope on the one ſide, and of the Republick on the other, were divided into various Opinions: The Conſiſtory being ended, the Cardinals <hi>Baronius,</hi> and <hi>Perron</hi> uſed many arguments in private to the Pope perſuading him to deſiſt from ſo difficult and hazardous an Enterpriſe; at leaſt that he ſhould expect a more favourable conjuncture of Affairs, rather than adventure all by a haſty and inconſiderate advice: but the Pope who was fixed on his Deſign became deaf to all Counſels which concurred not with his ſenſe.</p>
               <p>The Nuntio having received the Briefs, delivered them on <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day in the Morning to the Counſellours at the time when they were aſſembled, to hear the high Maſs; but the <hi>Doge Grimani</hi> lying at that time on his Death-bed, and dying the next day, the Senate delayed to open the Briefs, until according to their uſual Methods, they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the election of a new Prince. Of which the Pope having advice he immediately diſpatched Orders to his Nuntio, commanding him to proteſt againſt the Republick, and againſt their Election, as being void, and invalid, and of no power, whileſt they remained under the Cenſure of Excommunication: with this new device the Pope expected to make a diviſion, and a confuſion in their Councils; for he meaſuring the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Venice</hi> at the death of their Prince with thoſe at <hi>Rome</hi> during the vacancy of the Sea, did imagine that ſuch a Bone as this thrown into ſo numerous an Aſſembly would beget great diſturbances, and diverſity of Opinions; but this Government which hath always been firm, and conſtant, and which admitted of no <hi>Interregnum</hi> kept conſtant to their antient Principles, refuſing to give Audience to the Nuntio or any other forein Repreſentative, unleſs it were to paſs the Offices of Condolance for the death of the Prince.</p>
               <p>Thus (as we ſay) this Election admitting of no interruption, the ſame was compleated on the 10th. of <hi>January</hi> 1606.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1606.</note> by the unanimous conſent of the Nobles concurring in the choice of <hi>Leonard Donato</hi> a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour of great eminence, and eſteem for the probity of his life, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in Government, and knowledg in Learning: beſides his heroick Vertues, and qualities which recommended him to all mankind. After this Election all the Ambaſſadours from forein Princes went to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:50681:344"/>
with the new <hi>Doge</hi>; onely the Pope's Nuntio refrained from this Office; notwithſtanding which the <hi>Doge</hi> according to the uſual form wrote to the Pope giving him advice of his Election; to which the Pope contrary to his former intentions returned a favourable anſwer, giving his Nuntio Order to paſs the Complement, and in perſon to congratulate with the <hi>Doge</hi> for the honour with which he was inveſted.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing which after the election of the Prince was tranſacted in the Senate, was the Controverſie between the Pope, and the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and in the firſt place the Cavalier <hi>Peter Duodo</hi> was appointed Ambaſſadour to be diſpeeded to <hi>Rome,</hi> Then the Pope's Briefs were in the next place to he conſidered: the which being opened, and read, were found to run almoſt in the ſame ſtile, and tenure; one having reference to the Laws, and the other to the Priſoners, the Contents whereof were as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whereas for ſome years paſt the Senate had in their publick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, tranſacted, and eſtabliſhed ſeveral matters againſt the Liberties and Immunities of the Church, and againſt the Canons, Councils, and Pontifical Conſtitutions: And whereas the Council of the</hi> Pragadi <hi>in purſuance of ſuch Laws made by their Predeceſſours, had in the year</hi> 1603. <hi>Ordered, and enacted, That no Churches, or religious Houſes ſhould be built, or ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted without licenſe firſt obtained from the Senate: And whereas ſuch Laws being in themſelves void, ought to have been repealed, and cancelled; the ſaid Council did not onely confirm but enlarge the ſame, making thoſe Laws which were once reſtrained, and limited to the City of</hi> Venice <hi>onely, to reach, and extend to all parts and places ſubjected to that Dominion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſevere forfeitures, and penalties to the Offenders; as if both Churches, and Eccleſiaſtial perſons were ſubjected to the temporal Juriſdiction, and as if it were a capital crime, nnd wickedneſs to build a Church. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in purſuance of an other Law made in the year</hi> 1536. <hi>whereby a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of</hi> Mortmain <hi>was made, and penalties laid on ſuch, who ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licenſe obtained from the Senate alienate the Lands of Lay-perſons and beſtow them to pious uſes; which Law, as it ought to have been repealed, ſo on the contrary in the Month of</hi> March <hi>laſt paſt the Senate did not onely confirm the ſame, but did likewiſe enlarge, and extend the power thereof to all parts within their Dominions: as if that Signory which is but a temporal power had Authority with conſent, or concurrence of the Pope to diſpoſe of Eccleſiaſtical Eſtates, Goods, or Revenues, though left by pious, and faithful Believers as an Offering for ſin, and as an eaſe to their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened Conſciences. The which things being damnable, ſcandalous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Eccleſiaſtical liberty are null, and void in themſelves, and from the obſervance of which, all perſons are diſobliged. And it is hereby farther declared, that thoſe who have been contrivers, or Legiſlators of theſe or the like Statutes, have incurred the cenſure of the Church, and a forfeiture of all thoſe Lands which they hold of the Church, and their States, and Dominions are alſo liable to other puniſhments. So that unleſs every thing be reſtored to its priſtine State, perſeverance in the ſame will be an aggravation of the crime, for which no abſolution can be given, but on terms of reſtauration of all matters to their original condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore being exalted on our ſupreme Throne, on which we cannot nor ought to diſſemble any matters, We admoniſh you to conſider the danger of your Souls, for which this Republick is obliged to provide: for we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:50681:344"/>
under pain of Excommunication that the aforeſaid Laws, whether an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, or modern be revoked and cancelled, and that the ſame be publiſhed in all parts of your Dominions; and in caſe you refuſe to perform the ſame, We ſhall then be forced to proceed to the execution of this Our Sentence, ſo ſoon, as we have underſtood the preſentation of theſe Our Letters, from the report of Our Nuntio; and afterwards you are not to expect any other citation, or proceſs from us: for we are unwilling, that God ſhould in the laſt day of Judgment demand an account of this matter, and condemn us for want of performance of Our duty in this caſe. Wherefore we, whoſe end, and deſign it is to govern the Chriſtian State in peace, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cannot diſſemble in caſes, where the Apoſtolical Sea is offended, the Eccleſiaſtical liberty trampled under foot, the Canons neglected, the Rites of the Church and the priviledges of the Clergy violated, which is the ſum of this Our accuſation againſt you. And We do farther make known unto you, that we are not moved to paſs this Our Cenſure out of any worldly reſpect, having onely an ambition of zeal to exerciſe our Apoſtolical Government as far as we are able, in its due perfection. And as we would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench on the temporal Authority, ſo neither will we permit that the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical ſhould be infringed. But in caſe the Republick would be obedient to theſe Our Commands, they would free <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s from great troubles, and anguiſh of mind which we ſuſtain for their ſakes: And they alſo may conſerve the Lands which they hold from the Church: nor can this Republick defend themſelves from the force, and violence of Infidels by any better, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing means, than by doing right, and juſtice to the Clergy, who day and night watch over them, and pray unto God for this Republick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Senate having read, and conſidered theſe Briefs, thought fit to confer, and conſult with the moſt judicious, and able Lawyers of their age, ſuch as <hi>Antonio Pellegrini,</hi> and <hi>Eraſmus Gratiani,</hi> together with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul</hi> of the Order of the <hi>Servi</hi> a perſon profoundly learned in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and the Canons of the Church: unto theſe three, they added ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other learned Men, eminent for wiſdom and piety of Life, not Subjects onely to the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> but belonging to other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> namely <hi>Menocchio</hi> Preſident of <hi>Milan,</hi> and others; in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which caſe, they peruſed, and ſearch'd the Books, and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the moſt famous Doctors of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>: and according to the Opinion, and ſence of all thoſe learned Men in the Law, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between the Pope, and the Republick did relate wholly to temporal matters, unto which the Papal Authority did not extend; and that the Republick might in ſuch caſes order, and determine according to the nature, and exigency of their Affairs: and in farther proof and teſtimony hereof, many Laws were cited, which had been enacted in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian Countries, and Dominions, of the ſame ſubſtance, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure with theſe. And in this manner the Senate having received and underſtood the Opinion, and report of their Doctors returned their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto the Pope to this effect, dated the 28th. of <hi>January.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>With much aſtoniſhment and trouble of mind this Republick hath been informed by Letters from your Holineſs, that thoſe Laws which for ſome ages have been obſerved with much benefit to this Republick, and never queſtioned by your Predeceſſors, ſhould now be reprehended, and repealed by the Authority of the Apoſtolical Sea, the which Laws are ſo ſound, and ſafe for us, that the alteration of them would ſhake the very foundation of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:50681:345"/>
this Government; And we are troubled to think that thoſe Perſons who were of excellent piety, and vertue, that made and eſtabliſhed theſe Laws, and who are now in Heaven, ſhould be termed, and branded as violators of the Eccleſiaſtical liberty. And now according to the deſire of your Holineſs, we have cauſed all our Laws, both antient and modern relating to the points in Controverſie to be reviewed, and examined; and we find nothing which hath been eſtabliſhed by the Power of the Supreme Prince, in the leaſt derogatory to the Papal Authority: it being apparent, that it is the duty of the Secular Magiſtrate to inſpect and conſider what kind of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are fit to be admitted into the City; what Edifices are fit to be erected, and what are not, and what may in time prove hurtful to the publick ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for in regard the Dominion of</hi> Venice <hi>doth abound with Churches, and religious Houſes, as much as any other part, and that when it was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to erect more, a licenſe to build was not onely granted, but contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made thereunto by the publick liberality, and munificence; ſo when it was neceſſary to ſet bounds and limits thereunto, this Senate made uſe of their own Power alone without any diminution to the Canons of the Church. And whereas the Pope hath a Power to reſtrain the Clergy from alienating their Lands, and Eſtates to the Laiety without his conſent, and diſpenſation, ſo alſo hath the temporal Prince the like Authority to forbid and inhibit all Lay-perſons from making alienation of their Eſtates unto the Church. Nor do Eccleſiaſtical perſons loſe any thing by this reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but rather procure a benefit; for when the temporal Power is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſuch alienation, this State which is the Bulwark of Chriſtendom, will not be able to withſtand the common Enemy, nor afford due protection either to the Clergy, or Laiety. And therefore the Senate doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they have incurred the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure, conſidering that Secular Princes have received that Power from God of making Laws, which no other humane Authority is able to take from them: and much leſs have the Briefs of your Holineſs any place, or prevalence in matters purely temporal, which are clearly diſtinct from thoſe which are ſpiritual, to which the Papal Power doth ſingly extend. Nor can this Senate imagine, that your Holineſs, who is full of Piety, and Religion, will perſiſt in theſe your Comminations, until the cauſe hath firſt been fully examined, and diſcuſſed. And thus much they thought fit in ſhort to make known unto your Holineſs, referring all things to be treated and explained more at large by their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour Extraordinary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Letters of the Senate being arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> were preſented to the Pope by the hands of the Ambaſſadour, who immediately opened, and read them; but the Contents ſo little pleaſed him, that he was angry, and froward all the time that they were in reading: and in fine, he told the Ambaſſadour, that thoſe Letters were no Anſwer to his Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Briefs, that the Anſwer was frivolous and inſignificant; that the matter was clear and evident on his ſide, and that therefore he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to proceed unto Sentence: that the Senate muſt reſolve to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and obey, for his cauſe was the cauſe of God. <hi>Et Portae Inferi non praevalebunt adverſus eam.</hi> If the Monks of <hi>Padoua</hi> had purchaſed more Lands than were requiſite, or conſiſtent with the welfare of the State, upon addreſs made to him he could have applyed a Remedy, but the Senate proceeding in another manner were Tyrants, Uſurpers, and Men of Principles different from their Anceſtours: wherefore he exhorted
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:50681:345"/>
them not to deceive themſelves with the thoughts of protracting the time, in hopes of deciding the Diſpute by his death, for that in caſe he received not ſatisfaction therein, in the ſpace of fifteen days he would then proceed to execution of his Sentence. The fifteen days were ſcarce expired when the Ambaſſadour <hi>Nani</hi> acquainted the Pope that <hi>Duodo</hi> was diſpatched from <hi>Venice</hi> in quality of Ambaſſadour Extraordinary to inform his Holineſs more amply of all matters; to which the Pope replied, that there was no need of farther expoſtulations, the matter was clear, and he would be obeyed.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the Pope's haſt time was protracted till towards the end of <hi>March,</hi> when <hi>Duodo</hi> the Ambaſſadour Extraordinary arrived at <hi>Rome</hi>; to whom the Pope would not have patience to grant all the methods of Complements, but immediately at his arrival admitted him to Audience; when the Ambaſſadour largely diſcourſing on every point in Controverſie, concluded that the Senate could not yield to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of his Holineſs, without betraying that Power which God had put into their hands. But the Pope making no reply to the Arguments in particular, adhered cloſe to the Concluſion, that Eccleſiaſtical perſons were exempted <hi>Jure Divino</hi> from the Secular Dominion, that he had heard enough from <hi>Nani</hi> of this kind of reaſoning, that the Cauſe was God's, and muſt prevail.</p>
               <p>This reſolution of the Pope being made known at <hi>Venice,</hi> the Senate thought fit to communicate theſe their differences to the Miniſters of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein Princes, deſiring their Opinions on thoſe Points. From which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour excuſed him, not deſiring to concern his Maſter in thoſe matters, which might yield the leaſt diſpleaſure to the Pope; but the Imperial, and <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours were much more frank and open in their Opinions; for the firſt did allow and approve the reaſons of the Senate, alledging the Cuſtoms of his own Country the <hi>French Comte,</hi> where the ſame things were practiſed, and Monſieur <hi>de Freſnes</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour declared, that he could not underſtand thoſe Papal Laws which deny unto Princes the Government of their own State, and therefore the Republick was much to be commended for preferring their liberty before any other reſpect.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Rome</hi> the Cardinals of <hi>Verona,</hi> and <hi>Vicenza</hi> uſed all the Intereſt, and perſuaſions they were able to induce the Pope to defer the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of his Sentence for ſome time; putting him in mind, that the Spiritual Arms were not to be exerciſed, but in caſes where they were ſure to prevail; Then ſaid the Pope, I ſhall make uſe of the Temporal: and in the mean time to manifeſt to the World my patience, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs towards them, I ſhall grant them the term of twenty four days to conſider, and repent: and accordingly having formed and printed his Monitory on the 17th. of <hi>April,</hi> he cauſed it to be read and publiſhed in the Conſiſtory. After which he added, That he had greatly ſtudied this Point, and having conſulted with the moſt famous Canoniſts, the general Opinion of them all, was, that the Republick acted contrary to the Authority of the Apoſtolick Sea, and againſt the liberties, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of the Church; alledging in his favour the Council of <hi>Simmaco,</hi> and of <hi>Lions</hi> under Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> with other Decrees made by the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil:</hi> and that the ſame was ſo declared in the caſe againſt <hi>Henry</hi> II. againſt the Kings of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and other Kings;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:50681:346"/>
and cauſed a Conſtitution made by <hi>Innocent</hi> III. to be read; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the more regularly in this important matter, the Votes of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals were diſtinctly required: the number of Cardinals then preſent in the Conſiſtory were forty one, all which did either in few words aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or more at large produce the Authority of the Canoniſts in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Pope's reaſons. And indeed little leſs than this free concurrence could be expected from them: for though ſome few out of a zeal towards the Eccleſiaſtical liberty, might really be poſſeſſed with this Opinion; yet the generality were guided by other Principles; ſome perhaps were unwilling to diſpleaſe the Pope in expectation of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of themſelves, or Friends; others had a proſpect of ariſing to the Popedom, and for that cauſe were willing to exalt its Power: every one had ſome conſideration or other for his own benefit, but not ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration as was required in ſtudy of the caſe, or to find out the truth of the matter under debate. For Popes in the Conſiſtory are always ſure to find the Cardinals pliant, and ready to yield aſſent unto whatſoever they propoſe, that is <hi>Aſſentiri in Aſſentari.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conſiſtory being riſen the Monitory was affixed in all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places of <hi>Rome</hi>; of which a multitude of Copies both in <hi>Latin,</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> were printed, and diſpatched into all the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Dominions of <hi>Venice,</hi> and diſperſed into all parts by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> accompanied with ſeditious Letters, and Pamphlets derogatory to the honour of the Republick. The Monitory was directed to the Patriarchs, Arch-biſhops, Biſhops, Vicars, and all Eccleſiaſtics either Secular, or Regular, who held any Dignities, and preferments of the Church within the Dominion of <hi>Venice,</hi> and therein it was expoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whereas ſome Months paſt he was given to underſtand, (that is the Pope) how that the</hi> Doge, <hi>and Senate of</hi> Venice, <hi>had for many years paſt made ſeveral Decrees in prejudice of the Apoſtolical Sea, and priviledges of the Church, notwithſtanding that the ſame were repugnant to the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and to the antient Canons, and Conſtitutions of the Popes of</hi> Rome: <hi>and now more lately a Law was made in the year</hi> 1602. <hi>whereby Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical perſons are incapacitated to appropriate to themſelves any Lands, or Eſtates. Secondly, He mentioned the Law made in the year</hi> 1603. <hi>which reſtrains, and prohibits the erecting or building any Churches, or religious Houſes without the leave or licenſe of the Senate. Thirdly, He mentioned the Law in</hi> 1605. <hi>which extends theſe Laws over all the Dominions of the Republick which formerly were terminated to the City of</hi> Venice <hi>onely; and laſtly, the impriſonment of the Canon of</hi> Vicenza, <hi>and the Abbot of</hi> Nerveſa: <hi>by which particular offences the Eccleſiaſtical liberty being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed, the</hi> Doge, <hi>and Senate of</hi> Venice <hi>have to the danger of their own Souls and ſcandal of the World incurred the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures to the forfeiture of their Lands, and Juriſdiction, from which they cannot be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved but by the Pope himſelf, who being ſatisfied with their repentance, demonſtrated by a repeal of thoſe Laws, and reſtauration of all things to their priſtine condition, hath the ſole power to receive them again into the boſom of the Church. And whereas the</hi> Doge, <hi>and Senate after many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Admonitions, have not repealed thoſe Laws, nor releaſed the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he could in no wiſe ſuffer, that the liberties and immunities of the Church, and the Authority of the Apoſtolical Sea ſhould be violated, and infringed: And though thoſe Laws are in themſelves void and of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:50681:346"/>
yet by the example of ten Popes and more his Predeceſſours in confirmation hereof, and by and with the conſent, and counſel of the Cardinals (with whom he had adviſed hereupon) he doth farther declare thoſe Laws to be null, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled: and doth farther declare, and denounce Excommunication againſt the</hi> Doge, <hi>and Senate in general, in ſuch manner, as if they had been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly named, and againſt their Succeſſours, Councellours, Adherents, and Abettors, in caſe the ſaid</hi> Doge <hi>and Senate ſhall not within the ſpace of twenty four days after the publication hereof, (aſſigning eight days for each term of Admonition) repeal, cancel, and make void the aforeſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, with all Writs, and Orders proceeding thereupon: and without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delay or Excuſe, ſhall not reſtore all things to their former, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal condition, with promiſe never to do, or perform the like again; And ſhall not conſign into the hands of his Nuntio both the Canon, and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, giving advice, and notice of all unto the Pope himſelf: and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault thereof the Excommunication to remain in force, from whence no Abſolution can be granted, but by the Pope himſelf, unleſs at the point of death: from which State in caſe the perſon ſo abſolved ſhall recover, and ſtill continue, and perſiſt in the ſame obſtinacy, he ſhall again be liable to the ſame Excommunication as before; and in caſe he die his body notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhall not be interred in any conſecrated place, until obedience be yielded unto theſe Commands by all others concerned. And in caſe after the expiration of twenty four days the</hi> Doge, <hi>and Senate ſhall ſtill perſiſt in their contumacy for other three days, then he did Interdict all their Dominion, forbidding all Maſſes, and divine Offices to be performed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; unleſs in ſuch places, manner, and caſes as are granted by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law: And farther, he did deprive the</hi> Doge, <hi>and Senate of all their Revenue, and poſſeſſions which they hold of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, or other Churches and of all the priviledges granted them in favour thereof; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſtill unto himſelf, and his Succeſſours a Power to aggravate and encreaſe the Cenſures, and penalties againſt them, their Adherents, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors therein,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And to proceed unto farther puniſhments, and Remedies in caſe of continuance in ſuch like contumacy. Notwithſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all Patriarchs, Arch-biſhops, and Biſhops, and other Inferiour Clergy upon penalty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That after the receipt of theſe Letters, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof given, that they publiſh the ſame in the reſpective Churches, at ſuch times, as when the greateſt concourſe of people is preſent, and to affix the ſame at the Church doors,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After publication was made of this ſevere Excommunication thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out againſt a Republick of ſuch greatneſs and eſteem in the World: all the Ambaſſadours and Miniſters of foreign Princes reſiding at <hi>Rome</hi> were greatly troubled, and concerned, conſidering that an Act of this nature had ſome oblique reflection on every Prince, that profeſſed obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or devotion for the Papal Sea. Wherefore every one of thoſe Miniſters reſiding at <hi>Rome</hi> made their applications, and addreſſes to the Pope, deſiring him to moderate, and prorogue the Sentence until the matter were examined, and conſidered by the Republick, and ways or means contrived for an accommodation. To whom the Pope returned this general Anſwer, That the way to compoſe, and accommodate theſe differences were to incline the Republick to a reſolution of becoming obedient; but that word Obedient would not well paſs with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who made ſome reflections thereon, as unbeſeeming the degree of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:50681:347"/>
Sovereign Princes, and therefore perſuaded the Pope rather to uſe ſome more moderate, and gentle terms, and enlarge the time allotted for ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Sentence.</p>
               <p>The news hereof being come to <hi>Venice,</hi> the Senate immediately and in the firſt place ordered, that Prayers ſhould be made in all Churches, and Chappels imploring the Divine aſſiſtance in that great emergency of Affairs; and in the next place they reſolved to recall their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour Extraordinary from <hi>Rome,</hi> leaving <hi>Nani</hi> to reſide there, leſt they ſhould ſeem to deſpiſe, and ſtand in open defiance againſt the Apoſtolical Sea. Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> was at that time Reſident for the King of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> when the Senate thought fit to communicate to him the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Pope's Sentence, for until then they had never mentioned any thing with him of their Controverſie with the Pope, as they had alſo ordered their Ambaſſadour in <hi>England</hi> not to diſcourſe any thing of that Point unto his Majeſty or his Counſellours. But when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came to be adviſed to Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> he complained that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate had been much more free, and open to other Ambaſſadours than to him; and as to the pretenſions of the Pope, he ſaid, <hi>That he could not underſtand that piece of</hi> Romiſh <hi>Divinity, which was contrary to Juſtice, and moral honeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to provide againſt all thoſe inconveniences, and miſchiefs which might be the conſequences of this Excommunication, the Senate commanded all Prelats, and Eccleſiaſtical perſons not to permit or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Bulls, Briefs, or any other Writing to be affixed at any Church door, or publick place whatſoever, ordaining upon pain of the Prince's diſpleaſure that every perſon whatſoever, who had any of the Copies of that Brief, which was lately publiſhed at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the Republick, ſhould immediately deliver them up into the hands of the Magiſtrates in <hi>Venice,</hi> and to the Rulers, and Governours reſpectively in all places ſubject to that Dominion: which the people ſo readily obeyed, that in a ſhort time ſo great a number of Copies were brought in, as was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to conſider, how ſo many could be printed: and ſuch diligence was uſed by the Magiſtrates, and by the people themſelves, that not one Brief was affixed in any publick place; the perſons who endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act therein being diſcovered, and prevented.</p>
               <p>And farther, the true ſtate of that difference, which the Republick had with the Pope was adviſed, and intimated to all the Miniſters for foreign Princes reſiding at <hi>Venice:</hi> and the ſame alſo ſignified to all the Agents reſiding for that Republick in forein parts. In like manner the Senate wrote to all their Governours, and Magiſtrates of Towns, and Cities ſubjected to their Dominions, acquainting them with the injuries they had received from the Pope, and with the reaſons they had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their Laws, and Liberties, all which being ſignified as was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded unto the Counſels, and Magiſtracy of the Cities; it took ſuch impreſſion every where that the people yielded a moſt entire, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience thereunto, ſhewing themſelves ready to defend the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liberty, and in maintenance thereof every one offered Money, and Arms according to his ability: and in purſuance of ſuch Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, furniſhed the ſame, as time required.</p>
               <p>After publication made of the Monitory Brief, the Pope's Nuntio ſpent moſt of his time in the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> College, where many of thoſe Fathers

were received, who had been eminently known for the confuſions, and diſturbances they had created in the World: and particularly amongſt the reſt was one <hi>Bernardino</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> who had lately acted the like part at <hi>Paris,</hi> when the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were expelled from that City: and <hi>Antonio Poſſevino</hi> who was famous for his Actions in <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> and skilful in the management of Intrigues: there was alſo <hi>Barone</hi> a <hi>Venetian</hi> a bold confident Fellow, one that would have a hand in every matter of publick diſturbance: likewiſe <hi>John Gentes,</hi> who made profeſſion of truly ſtating all caſes of Conſcience, being endued with an excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, of finding fault, and of condemning, and reproving every thing which was acted without his concurrence, and of juſtifying every thing which was appointed, and directed by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>; all of them being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Inſtruments in their way, and faithful performers of the fourth Article of their Vow.</p>
               <p>But the Nuntio having thus frequented the Society of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and learned his Leſſon in every particular made a viſit to the <hi>Doge,</hi> to whom having in the firſt place expreſſed his grief for the unhappy eſtate of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, he deſired his Serene Highneſs to conſider of ſome ways, and means, by which theſe differences might be compoſed, and in order thereunto he promiſed his ultimate endeavours, and all the good Offices which his authority, and intereſt were able to perform: which Diſcourſe he ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the moſt perſuaſive, and affectionate expreſſions imaginable, often invoking the name of Almighty God; of whom when he had occaſion to ſpeak, he called him <hi>Our Lord,</hi> and in like manner, when he had occaſion to mention the Pope, he called him, <hi>Our Lord,</hi> ſo that in his Diſcourſe, it was difficult to diſtinguiſh which of the two Lords he meant; onely ſome obſerving perſons, had taken notice, that when he intended the name of God, he kept his head covered, but when he meant the Pope, he always took his Cap off.</p>
               <p>The Pope having underſtood how reſolute the Senate ſeemed in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their Laws, and Liberties, and with what chearful readineſs the people obeyed them, conceived little hopes at the preſent of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſires; and therefore judging that his Nuntio could not continue longer with honour at <hi>Venice,</hi> he diſpatched his Letters to recal him from thence, and intimated to the Ambaſſadour <hi>Nani</hi> by the biſhop of <hi>Soana</hi> that he ſhould depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> not leaving any of his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, or Subſtitutes in his place.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Venice</hi> the Superiours and Priors of Monaſteries, and other Churches were convened before the Council of <hi>Ten,</hi> who ſignified to them, that the pleaſure of the Prince was, that they ſhould ſtill continue to officiate and perform the Divine Offices, and that none of them ſhould leave the State without licenſe obtained. It was alſo declared, that protection ſhould be given to ſuch as remained, and that ſuch as would depart, ſhould not carry with them the Utenſils, or Veſtments, or Riches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Church. And that in caſe any Brief ſhould be ſent them from <hi>Rome,</hi> or Order from their Superiors, they ſhould firſt preſent it to the Magiſtrates, before it was read by themſelves; and the like Command was given to all Governours of Cities, and places under Dominion of <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As yet the <hi>Capucins, Theatins,</hi> and other Religious, had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained thoughts of departure; for when the Monitory was firſt publiſhed at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Provincial, and other <hi>Capucins</hi> held a Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:50681:348"/>
together, where it was concluded, that in regard the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Pope and the Republick had no relation to matters of Faith, they were not obliged to follow the Pope's dictates ſo far in this caſe, as to abandon their Habitations, and ſubſiſtence: yet afterwards the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours obeying the pleaſure of the Pope expreſly commanded all ſorts of Religious Orders to depart, and leave their Dwellings within the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of <hi>Venice</hi>; ſaying unto them, <hi>Come forth from them, O my People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The term of twenty four days being almoſt expired, when the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitory was to Commence, the Senate called the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to know their reſolution whether they would continue in the City, or not: to which they made anſwer, That they had intentions and deſires to ſtay, but could not promiſe to ſay Maſs, excepting which, they would engage to perform all other Divine Offices, and Service. The Senate taking this Anſwer into conſideration; reſolved that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſhould either cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate Maſs, as formerly, with all the other functions of Prieſthood, and not remain in a kind of indifferency between the Pope, and the Republick, ſerving God and Mammon, or otherwiſe ſhould have inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to depart. The which Order was ſignified to them by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal Vicar, with poſitive Orders immediately to depart, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign into his hands all the Plate, Veſtments, and goods belonging to their Church: and in like manner Orders were given to all Governours to execute the ſame Decree in their reſpective juriſdictions. This Command being ſignified to the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> they aſſembled all their Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into their Church, and gathered great Contributions from them; and perſuaded the <hi>Capucins,</hi> that when they departed, they ſhould march two and two in a rank, as in Proceſſion, with a Crucifix on the breaſt of every one which perhaps might move ſome diſturbance in the minds of the Commonalty, who beholding ſo many Crucifixes departing from them, might apprehend alſo, that Chriſt himſelf, and the light of the Goſpel was leaving their City, which Opinion might be the beginning of ſome happy Sedition.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> themſelves were haſtned away, and forced to depart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hours in the Night, every one carrying his <hi>Chriſt</hi> as they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it about his Neck; the People flocked in great numbers to ſee their departure, and accompanied them to the Boats, ſhouting, and crying aloud, <hi>Let them go to the Devil.</hi> In divers parts of the City they had concealed, and hid away the Veſſels, and pretious Ornaments of their Church, and their beſt Houſhold-ſtuff with their Library: leaving their College empty, and void of all Furniture whatſoever, or of any thing of moment, unleſs the Library given to them by the late Arch-biſhop <hi>Lewis Molino,</hi> with an other Library of prohibited Books. And though the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> had burnt many of their Papers, yet at <hi>Padoua</hi> they left divers Copies of a certain Book containing eighteen Rules, with this title, <hi>Regulae aliquot ſervandae, ut cum Orthodoxâ Eccleſiâ verè ſentiamus.</hi> In the ſeventeenth Rule of which, they were commanded, not to inſiſt overmuch in their Sermons, on the force and energy of the grace of God. And in the third Rule, they were enjoyned to believe according as the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of the Church believed; that is, if the Church determined any thing to be white, they ſhould believe it ſo to be, though the colour appeared black to the ſight of their own eyes. And laſtly,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:50681:348"/>
they left unto their Diſciples and Votaries certain Rules, whereby to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves during this Interdict.</p>
               <p>But though the <hi>Jeſuits, Capuchins,</hi> and other Orders of St. <hi>Francis</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed had abandoned <hi>Venice,</hi> and were retired to other Convents in <hi>Milan, Mantoua, Bologna,</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi>; yet the <hi>Capuchins</hi> of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi> (where were no <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to ſeduce them) remained in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Concord and Obedience; and ſecuring themſelves with that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection which they received from the Senate, remained reſolute, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to their Principles againſt all the Cenſures of Excommunication, and other Spiritual penalties iſſued againſt them by their Superiours; and in regard many of them were ſober and learned Men, they retort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all thoſe Spiritual Arms with great force, and power of argument and reaſon.</p>
               <p>It was certainly believed at <hi>Rome,</hi> that this Monitory would have produced three notable Effects: Firſt it was given for granted, that all the Religious Orders would immediately abandon the Dominions of <hi>Venice,</hi> by which the Interdict muſt of neceſſity have been obſerved. Secondly, That the City, and People finding themſelves deprived of all the Divine Offices, would riſe in a mutiny againſt the Government, and compel them to give ſatisfaction to the Pope. Thirdly, That it would beget a miſunderſtanding amongſt the Nobility, and cauſe them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into ſeveral Factions, towards which the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> (though abſent) did labour with all the Art, and induſtry imaginable. But the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> againſt their expectations finding that all matters had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect, that Maſs, and other Offices of the Church were Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without interruption, that the people frequented the Churches with greater Devotion than before; that the Senate were unanimous in their Counſels, and the Commonalty quiet, and obedient; they began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them of this proceeding, and many ſeverely blamed the Pope for being over-raſh, and haſty: for that though there might be reaſon in the merit of his Cauſe, yet the proſecution of it was of that importance, as ought to have been attempered with prudence, and the conſequences well weighed, before matters were ſcrewed up to that Degree, as admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of no indifferent terms, or accommodation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore now it concerned the Pope, and Clergy to labour with Art, and power of the Spiritual Arms in vindication of their Cauſe, in order whereunto the Cardinals were ſet at work to prevail with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory Friers, and Monks to leave their Dwellings, and Party and come over to them, promiſing in reward of that good Service, honours, and preferments in the Church; and on the contrary threatned them with Cenſures, and puniſhments both Spiritual and Temporal. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, they obſerved a different manner in treating with the rich Friers, and the poor <hi>Mendicants.</hi> For to the Poor they ſaid, that if they could not obſerve the Inderdict, they ſhould then depart, and leave all they had for ſake of the Goſpel; and if that were not permitted, they ſhould then ſeek after the glorious Crown of Martyrdom; But to the Rich, they thought better than to uſe this hard ſaying, <hi>Durus eſt hic ſermo,</hi> for though they were commanded to obſerve the Interdict, yet were advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to leave, or abandon their Monaſteries, and Revenues; and the better to inculcate theſe perſuaſions, Commiſſaries were appointed out of the ſame Orders privately to convey themſelves into the Dominions
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:50681:349"/>
of <hi>Venice,</hi> to inſtil, and foment this Doctrine in the minds of the <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi>; but the ways were ſo obſtructed by the diligence, and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Governours in their reſpective Dominions: that not a Frier durſt adventure to ſteal in, and engage in that Errand.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that this courſe would not take: the next expedient was to raiſe a duſt, and diſturbance in the Court of forein Princes. And in the firſt place, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> (who were and ſtill are very prevalent in <hi>Poland</hi>) laboured to put an affront on <hi>Foſcarini</hi> Ambaſſadour for the Republick to that King; cauſing two of the Gentlemen belonging to his Retinue to be diſturbed at Maſs, and expelled the Church: And the Nuntio made very warm Inſtances to the King, that the Monitory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Venice</hi> might be affixed in all publick places of his Dominions: but the King on the contrary did not onely refuſe to grant this requeſt, but highly reſented the late Affront offered to the two <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentlemen, in ſatisfaction for which by the King's Order, the Marſhal of the Court, and the Cardinal of <hi>Cracow,</hi> having aſſembled the Friers together, and duly reprehended their inſolence, commanding them the next day to ſing High Maſs in their Church, to which having invited the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour they obliged the Friers to ask his Pardon for the affront offered to his Servants: And farther the King, with approbation of his Council gave Orders to all his People to treat the Ambaſſadour, and his Retinue with all kindneſs, and due reſpect: and moreover wrote a Letter to the Pope, complaining of the late deſign of his Nuntio, attempting to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures againſt forein Princes within his Kingdom, which was a new and an unknown practice within his State; and had been refuſed in the Caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> III. King of <hi>France,</hi> and in the Cauſe of <hi>Ceſare d' Eſte</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> much leſs could he be induced to allow of ſuch proceedings againſt the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe Cauſe was the ſame with that of his own Kingdom. And conſidering that that State had merited well of Chriſtendom by the oppoſition they made with their Arms againſt the common Enemy, he exhorted his Holineſs to ſuperſede farther proceedings, for Cauſes which ought to be ſtifled, and which for better peace of the Church ought never to be brought into queſtion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1606.</note> or Diſpute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Francis Soranzo</hi> a Cavalier of <hi>Venice</hi> being at this time Ambaſſadour at the Emperor's Court, did rightly inform the <hi>Imperial</hi> Miniſters with the true ſtate of the difference between the Pope, and that Republick: and in regard the Conſtitutions of all <hi>Germany</hi> were the ſame, they could not do leſs than approve the Cauſe of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and condemn the Cauſe of the Pope, which confirmed the Proteſtants in their reaſons which they alledged, for detaining Eccleſiaſtical Benefices in their own hands. Howſoever, the Great Chancellour, and Marſhal <hi>Prainer</hi> were of different Opinions, taking part with the Pope againſt the affections, ſence, and Intereſt of the whole Court.</p>
               <p>When news came firſt to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> of the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Pope, and the <hi>Venetians</hi>; the conſtancy and firmneſs of that State to the Principles of their Government, was highly applauded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common Cauſe of all Secular Princes. Howſoever, the Nuntio made it his buſineſs to have the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadour declared in all Pulpits to be under Excommunication: The <hi>Genoeſes</hi> alſo who were powerful in that Court, being touched with envy on old grudges, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:50681:349"/>
for having lately yielded that Point of their liberty to the Pope, which <hi>Venice</hi> ſtill conſerved, did all the ill offices they were able againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick: but above all the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> joyning with the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi> ſhewed himſelf an open Enemy, and ſo prevailed with the King, and Council, that a Congregation of twelve Divines was held at <hi>Madrid</hi> in preſence of the Cardinal of <hi>Toledo</hi> to conſider, whether the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of <hi>Venice</hi> ought to be admitted into the Church at the time of Celebration of Divine Offices? the reſult of which was, that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour ſhould not be excluded, every one concurring in that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the Nuntio, and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> onely excepted.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the news came to <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Monitory was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed againſt <hi>Venice, Barberino</hi> the Pope's Nuntio made urgent addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the King, that <hi>Priuli</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadour ſhould be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from admiſſion into the Church; but his deſire was poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; both becauſe the King was willing to remain Neuter, and becauſe it was and is a Maxim of that Kingdom. That Popes have no power over the Temporal Government of Princes, and have no Authority on account for Secular matters to proceed againſt them, or their Officers by Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures.</p>
               <p>In <hi>England</hi> we may eaſily imagine what Opinion was conceived of theſe proceedings: for when <hi>Giuſtiniano</hi> the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Venice</hi> had acquainted King <hi>James</hi> with the ſtate of the difference between the Pope and the Republick: the King did much applaud the Laws and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the conſtancy, and reſolution of the Senate in the maintenance of them: adding, That he would gladly ſee a free Council eſtabliſhed, which was the onely means to reform the Church of God, and put an end to all Controverſies amongſt Chriſtians, which had no other original, or ſource, than onely from the uſurpation of Popes, and ambition of the Clergy: in which holy, and ſacred Deſign, he did not doubt but that the <hi>French</hi> King, and all other Chriſtian Princes would readily concur; and that perhaps a beginning thereof might ariſe from theſe troubles, and labours of the Republick. And farther the King added, That the Popes exalting themſelves above God were the ruin of the Church, and that it was no wonder, that their Pride admitted of no ſerious reflections, or moderate advices, being puffed up, and elated by the common adulation, and flattery which was uſed towards them.</p>
               <p>The States of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> wrote very obliging Letters to <hi>Venice,</hi> proffering to aſſiſt them with Arms, and Proviſions, in caſe they came to an open rupture, and acts of hoſtility with the Pope.</p>
               <p>In the mean time many effectual good Offices were performed both at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> by the Dukes of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> and by <hi>Guicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardin</hi> Ambaſſadour of the Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi>; and more eſpecially by Monſieur <hi>de Freſnes</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Venice:</hi> To all which inſtances, and applications from ſeveral Princes the Senate thought fit to make this general Anſwer: Firſt, they returned thanks for the good endeavours, and labours towards a Mediation, and then complained of the firm reſolutions of the Pope, which could not be ſhaken, or made plyable by any reaſonable terms which the Republick could offer. That there could be no hopes of accommodation until the Pope by taking off his Cenſures, did open a way to Treaties, and terms of Peace. That the Pope had proceeded ſo far in his injuries and affronts, as were
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:50681:350"/>
paſt all manner of reconciliation, and yet the Republick which was truly Catholick would ſtill bear their due reſpect to the Pope, ſo far, as was conſiſtent with their liberty, and with that right of Government which was committed to them by God.</p>
               <p>But whileſt matters were thus in Treaty at <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the Courts of Princes; the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> who were vigilant, and intent to do all the miſchiefs they were able againſt the Republick; did not ceaſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe Scandals, and Libels as well without <hi>Italy,</hi> as within, and to preach, and rail againſt them in their Pulpits, and Schools, endeavouring to poſſeſs their Auditories with the moſt malicious impreſſions they could beget, or frame in minds of Men; they alſo wrote Letters into all places defaming the Republick; ſome who would not adventure into the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of <hi>Venice,</hi> treated on the Confines with their Diſciples and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries: and others in diſguiſe entered within the Dominions ſowing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, and Faction in all parts, promiſing extraordinary Indulgences to all ſuch as ſhould obſerve the Interdict. They alſo forged ſeveral Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters entitling one from the Republick of <hi>Genoua</hi> to the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> another from the City of <hi>Verona</hi> to the City of <hi>Breſcia</hi> which were moſt ſcandalous, and abominable Papers. Then in other Writings they ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified themſelves for having in their Sermons inveighed againſt the Republick, calling it a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> Heretical, and tyrannical Government, with infinite other abominable Epithets. In fine, it was proved, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were the cauſes of all theſe diſturbances, having inſtigated the Pope to this Deſign, upon aſſurances, that they were able to divide the Senate, and by confuſion of their Councils to make way for the Pope's Authority. It was farther proved, That they had kept correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with the Enemies of the Republick to the great damage, and prejudice of the State, always interpoſing, and inſinuating themſelves into publick Affairs. That they were always contriving to inveigle ſick and dying Perſons, perſuading them for the ſake of their Souls to beſtow their Eſtates, and Inheritance on them, to the ruin, and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their lawful Heirs and Families. And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> farther, the Senate took into their conſideration, their Principles, which were always Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, in prejudice, and depreſſion of <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> and dangerous to the Maxims, and principles of their Government. It was farther alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> had been the Cauſes, and Inſtruments of all the tolerations, ſeditious diſorders, and evil ſucceſſes which had happened in our age in all the Kingdoms, and Provinces of the World: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not only ſome particular perſons were culpable, but even the whole Society, and order of them were dangerous and rotten in their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and deſtructive to the Government under which they lived. All which being proved, and made good in the Senate againſt them; It was deliberated,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1606.</note> and carried in the Affirmative by Decree of the 14th. of <hi>June,</hi> That the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who from their firſt beginning had been received into <hi>Venice,</hi> and there cheriſhed and favoured, and having in recompence of ſuch Indulgence and reſpect returned nothing but Ingratitude: being at preſent the Authors of all the troubles incumbent on the Republick, vilifying the ſame with all the Obloquy which could be uttered from the blackeſt Tongue of malice, and having been falſe Traitors, and Men of inſupportable Inſolences; the moſt Serene Republick did therefore ſpue them out, and baniſh them for ever the precincts of the State; and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:50681:350"/>
did Decree, and Enact, that they ſhould never be again received with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a concurrence of five Sixths at leaſt of the Senate, the number of which was to conſiſt of one hundred and eighty Votes. In paſſing of which Act, it is moſt apparent that their Crimes were as enormous, as they were clear and evidently proved; for the Scrutiny being made by the <hi>Ballot,</hi> their baniſhment was paſs'd with an unanimous concurrence, and a Decree made for their eternal Excluſion; though perhaps ſome few might be excepted who had been their Votaries and Penitents.</p>
               <p>This perpetual baniſhment of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> made the breach wider, and more difficult to be reconciled: and the Pope being ſenſible, that the hopes he conceived from the contrivances of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> were vain and fruitleſs, he applied himſelf to ſome other new Inventions; one of which was a Jubilee, which was publiſhed on the 19th. of <hi>June,</hi> inviting all Chriſtian people to pray unto God for the unity and peace of the Church, granting Indulgences, Abſolutions, and Remiſſions unto all, excepting ſuch as belonged to <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Interdicted Churches, to which none of thoſe graces, bleſſings, and pardons were to be diſpenſed. Now in regard that nothing is ſo deſireable in <hi>Italy,</hi> as the benefit of a Jubilee, It was conceived to be a moſt admirable Artifice to make the <hi>Venetian</hi> People ſenſible of their ſeparation from the Church, when they ſhould find themſelves uncapable to receive the Indulgences, and excluded from all the priviledges of the faithful: upon which advantage the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſhewed all their Art in the Towns bordering on the Dominions of the Republick, preaching up the Bleſſings of a Jubilee, and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miſeries of that People, who by their diſobedience, and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy had extruded themſelves from without the Pale, and become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of ſuch myſterious graces. Notwithſtanding which, the World was ſo well ſatisfied with the Cauſe, and ground of this Jubilee, that though at other times Men were fond of this priviledg, and held it in great eſteem and Devotion, yet the Indulgences granted hereby were coldly received in every place: nor did the <hi>Venetian</hi> Commonalty ſo much repine at this loſs, as to quarrel or mutiny with their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for want of that Spiritual Benefit.</p>
               <p>Thus when all religious Arts failed, and the Weapons of the Church were not keen enough to do Execution, the Pope reſolved to try what might be effected by the temporal Sword; but in regard his own was not ſharp enough, for the <hi>Venetians</hi>; he applied himſelf to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> deſiring to write to his Maſter the King; giving him to underſtand, that he did entirely caſt himſelf under his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, deſiring his favour and Aid againſt his Enemies; and therewith delivered him two Letters, one directed to the King, wherein he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Reaſons for his proceedings againſt the <hi>Venetians:</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> chief Miniſter of State, in which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended himſelf, and his Affairs to his care and defence, and with many obliging Expreſſions and acknowledgments, called him <hi>the Baſis of the Crown of</hi> Spain, <hi>on which the Catholick Monarchy was eſtabliſhed, and on which the foundation of the Church ſolely was repoſed, and depending.</hi> This kind Letter ſo pleaſed the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> that an Anſwer equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſing was returned from the King to the Pope, and with much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality delivered by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour attended with three Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, the ſubſtance of which was: That the King was extreamly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

to obſerve, that the breach and differences between him and the <hi>Venetians</hi> were ſo widened, and ſo far proceeded: but in regard the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Holineſs was far engaged, he was reſolved to vindicate the Dignity of the Apoſtolical See with his Arms; and accordingly had wrote to his Miniſters, and Officers in <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Princes depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his Crown. This Letter being read, was the ſubject of great joy and ſatisfaction to the Pope, and all his Party, and was proclaimed through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>all <hi>Italy</hi> much to the reputation of the Papal Cauſe; howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the triumph, and joy hereof was ſomewhat attempered by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals which were made by <hi>Spain</hi> in recompence of the troubles, and inconveniencies they were to receive by a War: the which Demands were; A releaſe of the yearly Tribute for the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>; a ſurrender of <hi>Ferrara</hi> for a Garriſon to offend the Enemy, and of <hi>Ancona</hi> for an <hi>Arſenal</hi> and <hi>maritime</hi> Proviſions. The which Conditions being grievous, and difficult to the Pope were only anſwered in general terms; but the report hereof was like a Trumpet of War which alarm'd all parts of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Dominions: and cauſed the Senate to write im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to their Proveditor General in <hi>Candia</hi> to ſend all the Gallies under his Command into the Gulph: Orders alſo were given to the Proveditor General in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> to raiſe four hundred <hi>Albaneſes,</hi> and <hi>Croats</hi> under four Captains, and to embark them on ten Veſſels which were built for that purpoſe, placing forty on each Veſſel. Likewiſe thirty Captains were nominated and appointed to be ready as occaſion ſhould require.</p>
               <p>The Pope on the other ſide, repaired his Fortifications at <hi>Rimini,</hi> and <hi>Ancona,</hi> and reinforced his Garriſon at <hi>Ferrara</hi> with a thouſand Foot; he likewiſe baniſhed all Strangers from <hi>Marca,</hi> and <hi>Romagna,</hi> and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Natives thereof to return into their own Country. But to the management of this War deſigned, many difficulties occurred: for in the firſt place, there was an exceſſive ſcarcity of all Proviſions in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Eccleſiaſtical State as alſo in <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> by reaſon of which the People cryed out nothing but Peace, and Bread: and on the contrary, there was great abundance of all things within the Dominions of <hi>Venice,</hi> from whence the People of the Pope's Country receiving the moſt part of their Proviſions were kindly affected to the <hi>Venetian</hi> State: but notwithſtanding all theſe difficulties, the Pope reſolved to proceed in his War, and to recruit his Troops; and for maintenance thereof new Impoſitions were laid on Salt, Fleſh, and Paper, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention alſo to lay a Tax on Wine, and Timber, if occaſion ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And in the mean time the Count <hi>de Fuentes</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> gave out, that he would have an Army ſpeedily in the Field conſiſting of twenty five thouſand Men, compoſed of <hi>Germans, Napolitans, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Venetians</hi> did not neglect all due care towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of War, and to make their Defence whenſoever they ſhould be attacked; yet with more eſpecial regard they had an Eye to Plots, and Conſpiracies within the State; giving Orders to their Sea-Captains to ſtop all Veſſels which ſailed in the Gulf, unleſs ſuch as had Paſſes from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for his own particular Affairs; which cauſed great embroils along the Coaſt of <hi>Romagna,</hi> and the <hi>Marca d' Ancona,</hi> which ſeemed, (as it were), to be blocked up: Orders were likewiſe given
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:50681:351"/>
to hinder all exportation of Corn out of the Dominions of <hi>Venice</hi>; and Sequeſtrations laid on the Revenues of the Clergy who had quitted, or abandoned the <hi>Venetian</hi> Countries; for which cauſe many Prelats at <hi>Rome</hi> were forced to retrench their Families.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the Promiſes made by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Aid to the Pope, which at the firſt heat were poſitive and large; yet the Court at <hi>Madrid</hi> coming to make more mature reflections on the tenure of their former Letters, thought fit to explicate their ſence more at large, and to ſignifie to the State of <hi>Venice, That it was not the intention of his Catholick Majeſty to make a War on the Republick, but onely to demonſtrate unto the World, that that Crown, would on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions be joyned to the Apoſtolical Sea.</hi> And accordingly <hi>D. Inigo de Cardenas</hi> Ambaſſadour reſiding in Ordinary at <hi>Venice,</hi> did on the 13th. of <hi>July</hi> preſent a memorial to the Senate. ſignifying: That the King being deſirous of doing good Offices in the mediation of Peace between the Pope, and that Republick, had commanded him his Ambaſſadour to interpoſe therein, aſſuring him, that whatſoever he ſhould act in order thereunto would be moſt pleaſing to his Majeſty. And that ſome Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might be made in order to this Accommodation, <hi>Cardenas</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that for a beginning thereunto, the Senate would give him leave, in their name, to deſire and ſupplicate the Pope, that he would be pleaſed to take off his Cenſures from them, being much troubled that they had ever given his Holineſs any cauſe of diſpleaſure; which being words of formality, and Complement onely, could not in reality be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the right of their Cauſe; and yet were in this ſtate of things of importance, and abſolute neceſſity. To which the <hi>Doge</hi> made An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That neither by himſelf, nor by the Senate was there ever any juſt cauſe of diſpleaſure given to the Pope; and therefore to Scandals, and Diſguſts voluntarily taken, and not given, there was no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, than voluntary Acknowledgments.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour urged the Senate, to be the firſt to make Overtures of Peace to the Pope, which could be no diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Republick, conſidering with what reſpect, and duty all Chriſtian Princes treated the Pope, and that it is, <hi>Jus Commune,</hi> to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and humble themſelves before his Holineſs for other matters, they might with all confidence rely on the directions of his Majeſty herein, whom they had always found a true Friend, and a faithful Ally. That conſidering on what terms the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſtood with them, and how he had declared himſelf of the Papal Party; it was not now ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to diſguſt the King his Maſter, and that therefore they would be pleaſed to think of ſome Anſwer, which he might with confidence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the King.</p>
               <p>The Senate having taken theſe particulars into conſideration, gave almoſt the ſame Anſwer, as they had newly done to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour; Adding onely to the <hi>French,</hi>
                  <q>That by way of Mediation, he would be pleaſed to repreſent unto the Pope; That the Senate was troubled, that his Holineſs would take diſpleaſure at the actions of a Republick, which was entirely devoted, and dedicated to the glory, and ſervice of God, to the publick quiet, and tranquillity of the World, and to the maintenance of that liberty, and Power which was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them by Divine Right.</q>

                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:50681:352"/>Theſe Negotiations being ineffectual, and fruitleſs; the Senate gave Order to <hi>Giuſtiniano</hi> their Ambaſſadour in <hi>England,</hi> to inform King <hi>James</hi> with the progreſs and ſucceſs of all theſe Affairs, and differences with the Pope: which when the King had rightly underſtood, he returned this Anſwer:
<q>That he was highly ſatisfied with the conſtancy of the People, and unanimous reſolution of the Senate in defence of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive liberty, and juſtice, and of that Power, which God hath beſtowed upon Princes. That the Declaration made by <hi>Spain</hi> in a Letter was ridiculous, and that matters of ſuch importance required more than words: That he was highly ſenſible of the honour which the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick had done him in ſending him an Ambaſſadour Ordinary, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; wherefore that he might return them the like demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſincere Friendſhip, he promiſed to grant and condeſcend to all the deſires of the Senate; for that he ſhould be very ungrateful, and unjuſt in caſe he ſhould deny protection to that righteous Cauſe of the Republick, which was engaged in the maintenance of that liberty and Authority, which is the common Right of all Princes in the Univerſe. And therefore in caſe the Senate ſhould at any time be engaged in War for this Cauſe, they might be aſſured, and rely on the word of a Prince, that he would aſſiſt them with all the power he was able, and that he had given Commiſſion to his Ambaſſadour at <hi>Venice</hi> to aſſure the Senate the like in his name: And farther, the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> by the King's Order added, That the King was not induced to grant them theſe ſuccours, on expectation, that they ſhould leave Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but onely from a principle of Juſtice, by which he eſteemed himſelf obliged to vindicate the Cauſe of Princes, and the Authority of the Secular Power; as alſo from a Spirit of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity, being reſolved to take that ſide, to which <hi>Spain</hi> was declared an Enemy: in return for which the Senate made their due acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the King.</q>

The news hereof coming to <hi>Venice,</hi> did much trouble the Senate, who apprehending leſt the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould attribute this act of Hoſtility ro the <hi>Venetians,</hi> would in revenge thereof make War upon them: to prevent which they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſpatched advice to their <hi>Bailo</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> giving him to undeſtand the truth of this Aggreſſion, which being performed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and not by them, ought to be repreſented to the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi> in ſuch manner, as might not be occaſion of any Rupture. The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> being rightly informed of the truth of this matter, did
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:50681:352"/>
believe that this attempt was performed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with Artifice, and deſign, and therefore gave Order to the Captain <hi>Paſha</hi> or Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his Gallies, to entertain a perfect good correſpondence with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and joyn with them to the confuſion of the Pope, and the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Some few days after this, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet conſiſting of fifty five Gallies came to an Anchor not far from <hi>Corfu,</hi> commanded by <hi>Gieffier Paſha,</hi> to whom General <hi>Paſqualigo,</hi> who then commanded the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet and was at <hi>Corfu,</hi> ſent a Complement by his Secretary to the <hi>Paſha,</hi> which was in like manner returned with many obliging Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, telling him of the great Eſteem and honour which the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had for the Republick; and as a demonſtration thereof had given him Commiſſion to joyn with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, and to make War on the Pope, and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in ſuch manner, as he ſhould receive direction from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> acting a part, or in the ſame body with them, as they ſhould think convenient and neceſſary: and in farther aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hereof he diſpeeded three Gallies commanded by the <hi>Bei</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata</hi> to inform <hi>Paſqualigo</hi> of theſe Reſolutions, which he had received in Commiſſion from his Maſter the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi> to which friendly offer, <hi>Paſqualigo</hi> returned a like courteous acknowledgment; ſaying howſoever, that he could neither do, nor act any thing herein without Orders, and directions from the Senate; and in the mean time, whileſt theſe Advices were in going, and Anſwers expected, he prevailed with the <hi>Turks</hi> to withdraw their Forces from thoſe Seas, promiſing to give them timely notice,<note place="margin">

               <p>About this time being in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Pope in juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe his proceedings, employed <hi>Scipio Gobellucci</hi> to write the reaſons, and arguments which moved and directed him in this Cauſe, which Papers were diſperſed over <hi>Mantoua, Milan, Cremona,</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> and Copies thereof ſent into <hi>Spain,</hi> and other parts: which Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings the Senate taking into conſideration, It was propoſed that they ſhould be anſwered by ſome learned Hand, and that all the Letters, Reaſons, and Proceedings in this Cauſe ſhould be printed, and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the World: but this Propoſal was generally diſliked by the Senate, as a matter which would exaſperate, and keep alive the difference, and rub on the Sore which already ſmarted too much: that the Cauſe of the Senate was ſufficiently known to the World; and that ſilence would look more like contempt, eſteeming ſuch Pamphlets not worthy the publick notice, or conſideration; and would argue greater reverence to the Apoſtolical Sea, than to expoſe and lay it open even in thoſe matters, wherein the Republick had received moſt manifeſt Injuries. Howſoever, it was impoſſible to reſtrain the Wit, and Pens of ſome working Heads and Spirits, who ſtill were writing Papers on one ſide, and the other, which being as yet onely in Manuſcript could not be ſo publick to common view, as when they were iſſued from the Preſs: howſoever in <hi>Milan</hi> there was a ſcandalous Pamphlet printed, and ſet out by ſome Churchmen; in which againſt the Rules of all Senſe and Reaſon, it was intimated; that during this Interdict, all Marriages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Sacrament of the Church, were invalid, the copulation adulterous, and the Children Baſtards; the which Paper being ſpread over all <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo, Breſcia,</hi> and <hi>Crema,</hi> it was thought fit that in confutation hereof
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:50681:353"/>
a Treatiſe wrote about one hundred and fifty years ago by <hi>Gerſon,</hi> ſhould be re-printed, and divulged; which was ſo oppoſite to the matter in hand, and ſo properly accommodated to the preſent times, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, that nothing could then have been better, nor more fitly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: to which was annexed a Letter without name, exhorting all Curates to attend their Flock, and Charge, without fear of giving any offence to God by not obſerving the Interdict. This Treatiſe of <hi>Gerſon</hi> being wrote ſo many years paſt, carried ſuch Authority, and weight, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> eſteemed it worth his Anſwer; and <hi>Baronius</hi> cryed it down, with ſuch paſſion, as if the belief thereof had been a total ſubverſion of the Chriſtian Religion: The Authority of theſe two learned Cardinals was ſo great, and conſiderable; that the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> thought fit for the better eaſe of pious, and tender Conſciences, to give a Licenſe to certain learned Writers to publiſh their Reaſons, and Arguments in defence of the Republick, reſtraining themſelves always within the compaſs of thoſe Rules which the Laws preſcribe: that is, That nothing ſhould be aſſerted contrary to Faith, good Cuſtoms, and manners, and the Authority of the Prince; for peruſal, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of which, five Divines were appointed to aſſemble in the Houſe of the Patriarchal Vicar; and to allow all writings of that nature, with their Imprimatur, before any Printer ſhould dare to put them in the Preſs, or publiſh the ſame.</p>
               <p>Thus were all the Wits ſet at work in writing, ſome on one ſide, and ſome on the other: the chief Heads which thoſe who wrote in favour of the Republick were theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That God had conſtituted two ſorts of Government in the World, one Spiritual, and the other Temporal: The Spiritual was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their Succeſſours; the Temporal unto Princes, and both were reſtrained within ſuch limits, as that one ought not to meddle, or interfere with the other. That the Pope hath no Power to annull the temporal Laws made by Princes, nor to depoſe them, or free their Subjects from their Allegiance to them; the which practice though endeavoured for the ſpace of above five hundred years to be introduced, is yet contrary to the Scriptures and the Example of Chriſt, and his Saints. That the Doctrine which teaches, that in caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between the Pope, and a Prince, it may be lawful to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute ſuch a Prince either by open War, or ſecret Treaſon, and that Diſpenſations may be given to Subjects to rebel againſt ſuch a Prince; is a damnable, ſeditious, and ſacrilegious Poſition. That by Divine Law the Clergy are not exempted from ſubjection to the Secular Power, either as to their Perſons, or Eſtates though by many immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and priviledges granted to them by the favour of pious Princes, from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to <hi>Frederick</hi> II. ſeveral exemptions have been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the exigence of times, and convenience of places. That the Exemptions which Popes have given to the Clergy from the Secular Power have not been received in many places; and where they have been received, the Conceſſions, and Grants are no farther obligatory to the Prince, than whileſt they are conſiſtent with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, and convenience of the Publick.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another Point inſiſted upon was this:
<q>That the Pope was not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, but onely in ſuch matters wherein God had promiſed him
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:50681:353"/>
his Divine aſſiſtance: which according to the Doctrine of ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divines was onely in neceſſary points of Faith. And that the Power of binding, and looſing, was onely, <hi>Clave non Errante.</hi> That according to the Doctrine of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> An Excommunication againſt a multitude, or againſt any one who Commands in Chief is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and ſacrilegious. That the new name of Blind Obedience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> was unknown to the antient Church, and every good Divine, the which as it takes away our Election, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of knowledg in every good work, ſo it expoſes Men to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of offending God, and hath been the cauſe of thoſe many Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have ariſen in the World for the ſpace of forty years paſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Popiſh Party on the other ſide proceeded on theſe Maxims:
<q>That the temporal Power of Princes is ſubject to the Eccleſiaſtical; on which ground the Pope hath Power to depoſe Princes from their Authority for Errours committed in their Government, when the Pope judges it may be beneficial to the Church. That the Pope hath Power to abſolve Subjects from Allegiance to their Prince, the which ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and modeſt Men explaining, ſaid, not that Chriſt had given this temporal Power abſolutely to the Pope, but indirectly as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the better Government of the Spiritual; but others who were more bold did not think it worth the while to mince the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but confidently wrote, That the Pope was endued with all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority both in Heaven and Earth, and made Supreme over all Princes of the World, who were his Vaſſals, and may puniſh them for their faults, and errours; that he is the Supreme Temporal Monarch over all the World and appeals may be made to the Pope from all Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes. That he can give Laws to all Princes, and annull theirs; As to the Exemption of the Clergy, they all denied that they were ſubject to the temporal Law; and that this priviledg was not given them by the favour of Princes; but (as ſome would have it) <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> others by the Conſtitutions, and Decrees of Councils, and Popes; but in this they all agreed, that they were not ſubject to the Prince, not ſo much as in caſes of Treaſon; and that they were not obliged to obey the Laws of the Land wherein they lived, but onely <hi>Vi Directivâ.</hi> And ſome were ſo bold as to proceed ſo far, as to ſay, that the Clergy were Judges, whether the Laws of Princes were juſt or not, and whether the people were obliged to obey them. That in regard the Pope who hath the Spirit of God cannot err, his Sentences are to be obſerved, whether they be juſt, or unjuſt. That ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and authentick is the Opinion of the Pope, that it ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt all other determinations of the World. That the Pope is God upon Earth, the Sun of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> Pope are the ſame, and their Tribunal the ſame: but it is very obſervable, what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> aſſerted; That to reſtrain obedience due to the Pope unto matters appertaining onely to the Soul is to reduce it to nothing; that St. <hi>Paul</hi> appealed unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> who was not his Judg and not to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> was becauſe he would not make himſelf in thoſe days ridiculous. That the antient Popes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſubjection to the Emperours was to comply with the humour, and affection of thoſe times. Others alſo have added, That the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:50681:354"/>
of the Pope was to be introduced by degrees, and inſiſted upon with ſome moderation out of reſpect to the infirmities of Princes who were lately become Proſelytes to the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to return now to the matter of Treaty. Towards the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> an other Overture was made, which was the ſummary of all this Negotiation, though various things were afterwards treated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any effect. For about the 17th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Freſnes,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Venice</hi> did in the name of his Maſter propoſe, as entrance to an Accommodation; That the Senate ſhould ſuſpend the Execution of thoſe Laws, which gave offence to the Pope, conditionally that the Pope ſuſpend the Cenſures of his Monitory for the ſpace of four or ſix Months: but if this Expedient would not be accepted, then it was propoſed, That the Priſoners ſhould be conſigned into the hands of the Pope at the inſtance, and deſire of the King without prejudice to the Right, and Reaſon of the Senate; for that it was neceſſary to give ſome colour of ſubmiſſion, and condeſcention to the demands of the Pope; there being no Preſident, that any Pope did ever recal his Boles unleſs that which by Authority of the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</p>
               <p>Theſe Propoſals being debated in the Senate, it was in the firſt place concluded, and agreed, <hi>That the liberty of the Publick was to be conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and preferred before all other worldly reſpects whatſoever.</hi> That the Priſoners indeed might be reſigned into the hands of the Pope at the inſtance, and requeſt of the <hi>French</hi> King, without being made a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent in like caſes, or be a prejudice to the Liberty in times to come; but that to ſuſpend the force of the Laws, was a certain violation of it, and a ſhake of the Foundation of that Government which had for many hundreds of years been rooted, and eſtabliſhed; for that every ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a Law doth argue either weakneſs in the Authority, or in the Council, which being the ſubſtance of this Conſult, it was given for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Monſieur <hi>de Freſnes</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, as alſo to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour <hi>de Cardenas,</hi> who inſiſted on the like Terms.</p>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 1606.</note>Whileſt theſe things were negotiating by the forein Miniſters; and that the Senate was reſolved to adhere to that Principle, That <hi>no way or conceſſion was to be given to the leaſt point or particle which might prejudice the publick Liberty</hi>; News came about the beginning of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> that a new Congregation was erected in <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of War,</hi> which was appointed to aſſemble twice every Week to conſult of the manner, and means of waging the Temporal War; This new term of a <hi>Congregation of War,</hi> which was never heard of before in <hi>Rome,</hi> adminiſtred ſubject of Diſcourſe to all <hi>Italy,</hi> both becauſe it was contrary to the antient practices of that Court, which did always cover their temporal Deſigns with Spiritual names; and becauſe the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement thereof was committed to the care of fifteen Cardinals, who were all Men of Letters, but not of Arms: howſoever they ſerved the preſent turn, for being Men of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> faction, and depending upon <hi>Spain,</hi> it was believed, that their Intereſt and Power would have been very available in that Court for carrying forward the War, and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the principal Miniſters in their quarrel.</p>
               <p>All Princes of Chriſtendom being now concerned in this difference, and great endeavours made for reconciliation; it was encharged to

                  <hi>Giuſtiniano</hi> Ambaſſadour to the Court of <hi>England</hi> to repreſent unto that King the proviſions which were making at <hi>Rome</hi> for a War, deſiring, that his Majeſty would prepare thoſe Forces, which he had already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in defence of their Republick; for that <hi>Spain</hi> was arming, and threatned on all ſides to invade them: To which the King anſwered,
<q>That he was reſolved to defend their Cauſe, not out of any grudge or quarrel of his own with the Pope; but, (as he called God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) out of a principle of duty to conſerve that Liberty which God had given to Princes: nor had he any reſpect to his own particular benefit, or hopes to receive Rewards from the Republick; but onely to the juſtice of that Cauſe which was moſt juſt, and pleaſing to God: and that therefore he would ſpeedily perform his Promiſe with more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and conſtancy of mind towards the Republick, than the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had done to the Pope, whoſe Letters, and Promiſes contained nothing but froth, and vanity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus were all Chriſtian Princes concerned in this quarrel on one ſide, or the other, ſome being intent to accommodate differences by middle, and moderate terms, and others to take Parties, and aſſiſt with Arms, and open Violence: until at length about the middle of <hi>October,</hi> the Pope taking it into his conſideration, that ſo much the longer, that this quarrel continued, and that the <hi>Venetians</hi> remained in their ſeparation from the Church, ſo much more did his Reputation ſuffer, and the Power of the Spiritual Authority diſcover its own weakneſs: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore calling Monſieur <hi>d' Alincourt</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour unto him, he declared, and proteſted, that he was infinitely deſirous of an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, and was ready to accept of any terms which were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, or derogatory to the honour of the Papal Sea: Upon which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lincourt</hi> entering into conſultation with the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals, ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals were ſent to the Republick, and communicated by the hand of <hi>de Freſnes,</hi> containing a Project, for making, and eſtabliſhing a Peace. Nor was the King of <hi>Spain</hi> unactive herein; but to ſhew his zeal, he diſpatched an Ambaſſadour Extraordinary to <hi>Venice</hi> upon this occaſion, who declared in the Senate, that his Maſter was ſo paſſionate in this buſineſs, <hi>That if he had two Sons he would be contented to ſacrifice one of them on condition, it might be an offering of atonement, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation between the Pope and the</hi> Venetian <hi>State.</hi>

               <p>The Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> obſerving, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> armed, did not think it agreeable to the Rules of good Government for them to ſit idle, but to put themſelves in a poſture of War to repel Force with Force, and to be in a readineſs on all occaſions which might happen.

               <p>And indeed this Cardinal was the moſt fit and proper Inſtrument of any to effect this accord: for he was not onely a Perſon of great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and Authority in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> being a Cardinal of the firſt degree, and rank; but alſo of great reputation with the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi>; who being deſirous to commit the Office of mediation to the Intereſt of the <hi>French</hi> King, whom they had found more ſincere, and real to them, than the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Adherents, they received the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal with entire ſatisfaction, who arrived at <hi>Venice</hi> about the middle of <hi>February.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal ſpending little time in formal Ceremonies, and Viſits, immediately entered on his buſineſs, delivered his Credential Letters, and opened his Commiſſion: and in the firſt place inſiſting that as it was neceſſary to provide for the ſecurity, and reputation of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; ſo alſo it was neceſſary to contrive ſuch means as might give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Pope, whoſe Propoſals were theſe: That an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour be ſent from the Republick to deſire his Holineſs, that he would be pleaſed to take off the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures which he had paſſed upon them; That all the Religious, as well <hi>Jeſuits</hi> as others, who had left, and abandoned their dwelling, and Habitations, ſhould be again reſtored. That the King ſhould give his word to the Pope, that during this Treaty at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Laws about which this Controverſie aroſe, ſhould be ſuſpended: And the Cardinal inſiſting more on this Point, than on any other, earneſtly urged that ſome reſolution might be taken ſpeedily, and with ſecrecy on which the King might with confidence eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this his promiſe and aſſurance. On this laſt Point the Cardinal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with more than ordinary preſſures, declaring, that the ſeaſon of the year which was now only proper for Conſultations, and Treaties was but ſhort; and that the time of War, and action approached, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was neceſſary to come to a determination; and that the Senate would more eſpecially declare themſelves concerning the Laws: for as the King did not deſire, nor approve, that any Decree, or Law ſhould be made and recorded for ſuſpenſion of theſe Laws, nor any other thing which might prejudice the dignity of the State, and the publick Liberty: ſo he alſo did conſider: That as the Pope had paſſed theſe Cenſures open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in the ſight of the World, ſo he could not take them off, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome apparent reaſons and cauſes, which might ſalve his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his honour. And becauſe the King his Maſter did well know,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:50681:355"/>
that the Republick was extreamly averſe to ſuch ſuſpenſion, he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to touch that Point very tenderly, and eaſe them therein by taking the whole burden on his own ſhoulders, giving his word to the Pope, that thoſe Laws ſhould be ſuſpended during this Treaty, without any Decree, or Declaration on part of the Republick: conditionally, that as the Pope ſhall hereupon without farther delay take off the Cenſures; ſo the Republick ſhall promiſe unto the King not to execute theſe Laws during the time of this Treaty: the which being aſſented unto by the Senate, he did not doubt but to give ſatisfaction unto the Pope, and maintain and ſecure their Liberty, and conclude all with a happy and bleſſed Peace. As to that Article, which concerned the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> his Maſter's deſire was, that they ſhould be reſtored; it being an ordinary conceſſion and grant in the concluſion of all Treaties; that ſuch as have been Parties, Fomenters, or Abettors on either ſide ſhould be remitted, and included in the Articles, for that indeed it was not conſiſtent with the honour of the Pope, that thoſe, who had ſuffered for his Cauſe, and for their Obedience to the Apoſtolical Sea ſhould be excluded, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for the performance of their duty.</p>
               <p>To this Speech of the Cardinal the Senate made this Anſwer, That the expulſion of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> was reſolved, and decreed upon very ſound, and mature conſiderations, and the Law againſt them ſo firmly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as could not be repealed: and yet to ſalve the Pope's reputation herein; all other Religious, ſuch as Friers, and others, who were Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Abettors of the Pope's Cauſe, ſhould be included, and reſtored to their priſtine ſtate, and condition: but as to the Point of giving their word to the King for non-execution, or ſuſpenſion of the Laws during this Treaty, they could not recede from the determination ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, which was, <hi>That in the uſe of theſe Laws, they will not depart from their antient Piety, and Religion profeſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Cardinal inſiſted, and deſired to have had ſome thing more plain, and agreeable to his Propoſition: but howſoever (being well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Pope's mind to agree almoſt on any terms) he made this Reply to the Senate, that though he expected to receive an Anſwer more ſatisfactory to his Demands; yet conſidering that it was the King's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that the Republick ſhould have entire contentment, he reſted ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this Anſwer, which he deſired might be kept as a Secret, leſt being divulged, it might be interrupted by the contrivances of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and malitious ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Howſoever, the Senate reſolved to communicate all that paſſed to <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, who had offered a like Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; and having been to make the Cardinal a Viſit had deſired to joyn with him in this Negotiation; which the Cardinal refuſing, <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco</hi> was very urgent to know all particulars, which the Senate very readily communicated to him.</p>
               <p>Thus were the Treaties ſo far proceeded, as adminiſtred great hopes of Peace, had not the great preparations made for War by the Count <hi>de Fuentes</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the diſturbances amongſt the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> rendered all things cloudy, and tending to a ſtorm: howſoever the Cardinal <hi>Joyeuſe</hi> with ſuch Anſwer, and Propoſals, as he had obtained from the Senate, reſolved for <hi>Rome,</hi> and accordingly departed from <hi>Venice</hi> on the 17th. of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:50681:356"/>The Cardinal was no ſooner departed, but the Marqueſs <hi>de Caſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lione</hi> arrived at <hi>Venice</hi> with Character of Ambaſſadour from the Emperor to the Pope; And though the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was employed for the Emperour, and then reſided at <hi>Venice</hi> in quality of his Ambaſſadour, yet <hi>Caſtiglione</hi> had Orders in his way to ſtop there and encline the Senate, (as well as he was able) towards a Peace; but this Marqueſs could obtain nothing more than what was delivered to the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; of which the Ambaſſadour <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> made col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections in writing, with the proceedings of all the Treaty, Copies of which he ſent with diligence to <hi>Rome,</hi> and were not onely ſhewed to the Pope, but diſperſed through all the Court, to the intent, that it might be made known to the World, that the <hi>French</hi> were not able to procure, or gain other terms from the Senate, than ſuch as had been already granted to the Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> and other Princes. Of which the Senate having information, thought fit for prevention of falſe Reports to ſend authentick Copies of all proceedings to their Miniſters in forein Courts, and particularly that of their laſt reſolution.</p>
               <p>The arrival of the Cardinal at <hi>Rome</hi> filled all the Town with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; every one ſpeaking variouſly as his paſſion guided, ſome being of Opinion that the matters were all concluded; others of different ſentiments believed, that they were impoſſible: and indeed the Pope himſelf being diſtracted by both ſides, remained unreſolved for the ſpace of three or four days; during which time, he confeſſed himſelf to have been as it were tormented on the wrack: For he conſidered, that to yield unto the <hi>Venetians</hi> almoſt in every Point, was a ſcandalous dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution to the Papal Power; and to abandon the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> his faithful Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers was yet more hard, and intolerable; for if for two Clergymen onely there had been ſuch a clutter, how much more ought he to be concerned for a whole Order, and for the conſervation and re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his moſt beloved Emiſſaries. But in regard the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſeemed reſolute in that Point, the Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> perſuaded the Pope to wave the Diſpute, leſt when all other Points were agreed, it ſhould be ſaid, that the particular Cauſe of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſhould become the Univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of the whole Church; and that it was neceſſary in the firſt place to eſtabliſh the Papal Authority in <hi>Venice,</hi> before he could hope to gain admiſſion for the <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> and that herein he would do well to follow the Example of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. who in a Controverſie he had with <hi>France</hi> on the ſame Subject, was contented to wave the Point concerning the reſtoration of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and in the time obtained that, which at that preſent ſeemed impoſſible: upon which Advice the Pope was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to leave that matter wholly to the management of the Cardinal, with Inſtructions to perform the beſt he could therein, but not to break off upon the refuſal of it.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal having agreed all matters with the Pope, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Inſtructions how to manage his Intereſt, (for he confided more in the Cardinal than in any other of the Miniſters:) he in the firſt place gave account to the King his Maſter of his ſucceſs; and then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Poſt rode very hard to <hi>Ancona,</hi> from whence taking a Boat he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in haſt at <hi>Venice,</hi> hoping in the Holydays of <hi>Eaſter</hi> to operate bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in favour of the Pope, and prevail on the minds of the Senate, which he expected to find more gently diſpoſed in the days preparatory to that Feſtival.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:50681:356"/>The next day after his arrival the Cardinal had Audience of the Senate, to whom he declared the ſubſtance of his Negotiations, but did not yet ſo far open himſelf, as to ſpecifie the particulars, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Pope's Breviate, though the Senate was well adviſed, that the Cardinal had no other Writing, than certain Inſtructions ſubſcribed by the Pope's own hand: but yet the reputation which the Cardinal had of being one of the firſt Degree in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> forbad all farther enquiry into his Power or Authority. The Cardinal therefore in the firſt place enlarged himſelf in a Rhetorical Speech concerning the good will, and intention of the Pope, which was directed to no other end, than the good, and welfare of the Chriſtian Church, being deſirous to ſupport, and maintain the Papal Dignity with a conſtancy becoming the Apoſtolical Chair: and though the Pope had long ſince endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to accommodate his differences with the Serene Republick, yet the concluſion had been often interrupted by the ill Offices, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of Men not well inclined to the publick Peace; Howſoever his Holineſs being willing to ſurmount all Controverſie, the difficulties were reduced unto two Heads: The firſt Point was, that an Ambaſſadour ſhould be deſigned unto <hi>Rome</hi> before the Cenſures were taken off; and the ſecond, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> ſhould be reſtored: howſoever, ſince the Senate had made ſo much difficulty on the firſt Point; he had received Inſtructions to yield it unto them, and in the firſt place to take off the Cenſures; but as to that concerning the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> it admitted of longer Diſpute, of which he deſired to be heard at a more private Audience.</p>
               <p>In concluſion, after that matters were debated for three or four days in the Senate, all came to be reſolved in this manner:
<q>That the Cardinal ſhould publickly in the Palace of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and in the face of the whole Senate declare that the Cenſures were taken off, or that he did then make them void, and null.</q>
For though the Senate did ſtill inſiſt on their Innocence, and that they had never juſtly incurred the penalty of the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure, yet however it being judged an Act of no prejudice to their Cauſe, the Cardinal's Declaration was admitted: though the Senate would not conſent, to accompany the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal to St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Church, and there after Maſs was ended to receive a Benediction from him, leſt it ſhould appear to the People, as if the Cenſures were taken off by that Benediction, which would be a tacite Confeſſion that the State was guilty of ſome fault, which they in no wiſe yielding unto, would not admit of the leaſt colour, or appearance of Abſolution.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That at the ſame time when the Cardinal declared the Cenſures taken off, the <hi>Doge</hi> ſhould deliver to his hand a revocation of the Proteſt which the Senate had made, when the Cenſures were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The manner, and form was agreed for delivery of the Priſoners.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It was agreed, that all Friers and other Religious ſhould be reſtored again to their Monaſteries, and Convents, excepting onely the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and fourteen other Friers who were fled for their Crimes, and not on account of the Pope's quarrel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, It was agreed, that an Ambaſſadour ſhould be immediately choſen, and with all convenient ſpeed ſent to the Pope.</p>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 1607.</note>The Articles being thus agreed, and confirmed, the 21th. of <hi>April</hi> was the day appointed for putting matters in Execution, which were performed in this manner:</p>
               <p>The Cardinal being lodged in the Palace of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Freſnes</hi> early attended him at that Houſe, where <hi>Mark Ottobon</hi> the Secretary, accompanied with two Notaries belonging to the <hi>Ducal</hi> Office of <hi>Chancery,</hi> and with other Officers of the Priſon, brought before the Ambaſſadour the two Priſoners, <hi>viz.</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Nerveſa,</hi> and <hi>Scipio Saraceno</hi> Canon of <hi>Vicenza:</hi> and then the Secretary having made his Obeyſance to the Ambaſſadour; ſaid, <hi>Theſe are, my Lord, the Priſoners, which our moſt Serene Prince, according to a late agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath ſent to be conſigned to your Excellency:</hi>
                  <q>Proteſting howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that the ſame was done with intent, and deſign onely to gratifie his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, without prejudice, or infringment of that Authority and Right which the Republick hath to paſs Judgment on Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, and to cite them before their Secular Tribunals of Juſtice.</q>
To which the Ambaſſadour replyed, That he underſtood it ſo, and in that manner he received them; Of which the <hi>Ducal</hi> Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries taking notice, entered the ſame in their publick Regiſters. This being done, the Priſoners recommended themſelves to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour's protection, who promiſed them his favour; and cauſing them to follow him into a withdrawing Room where the Cardinal was ſeated; He ſaid to him, Theſe are the Priſoners, which are to be delivered into the hands of the Pope; Then ſaid the Cardinal, conſign them into the hands of this Perſon (pointing to the Officer, who was <hi>Claudio Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tano</hi> the Pope's Commiſſary, ſent to that end and purpoſe;) who having touched them in token of ſeizure, and poſſeſſion, he deſired the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Juſtice that they would be pleaſed to take the care, and cuſtody of them.</p>
               <p>This matter being paſt, the Cardinal with the Ambaſſadour went to the <hi>Doge,</hi> who after Maſs returned to the College, attended with the Signory, and the <hi>Savii</hi>; and having there taken their Seats the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal entered, and declared himſelf in theſe words:
<q>I rejoyce much to ſee this moſt happy day, greatly deſired by me; in which I declare to your Serene Highneſs, That all the Cenſures of the Church are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off from you, as in reality they are; and hereof I cannot but te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie a moſt ſenſible ſatisfaction, in reſpect to that great benefit which all Chriſtendom, and <hi>Italy</hi> in particular will receive thereby.</q>
Then the <hi>Doge</hi> delivered into the hands of the Cardinal the revocation of the Proteſt, which was in this form directed to all the Prelats, to whom the Proteſt was ſent, and was to this purpoſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That whereas expedients and means have been found to make the Pope ſenſible of the true candour of mind, and the ſincere actions of this Republick; ſo that all Cauſes are removed of the preſent differences: And whereas this Republick hath always endeavoured to maintain a perfect good underſtanding with the Apoſtolical Chair; ſo now more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially it remains ſatisfied in having at length obtained this their moſt juſt deſire, of which it is thought fit to give them notice. Adding far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>That all matters being performed on both ſides, which were moſt equal, and the cenſures taken off, the Proteſt alſo was revoked.</hi>
                  </q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:50681:357"/>In the Evening the Senate aſſembled for choice of an Ambaſſadour to be ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> and reſide with his Holineſs; the Perſon elected was the Cavalier <hi>Contarini,</hi> who in Company with three others had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been employed to congratulate with the Pope for his aſſumption to the Papal Chair: and herewith ended this great Controverſie between the Pope, and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which had diſturbed all Chriſtendom, and might have been the ruin, and deſtruction of the Papal Authority, had not the Pope wiſely in time been made ſenſible thereof, and granted every thing almoſt, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> required: In the beginning and progreſs of this whole matter, we may obſerve the ſpirit of this <hi>Paul</hi> V. who aſpired to make himſelf as great, as <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to follow much of his way, and method; but he undertok an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe which was too difficult, and out of his power: his Errour in which was grounded on a miſtake; that he was better able to cope, or deal with a Republick, than with a Monarch; for that the firſt being compoſed of divers Heads, and humours might ſooner admit a diviſion in Councils, than in a ſingle perſon; and that many of them being zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and moſt of them ſuperſtitious in Religion might be affected by Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, and terrified by Excommunications. But the contrary was made to appear by the effects, which moſt evidently have ſignalized the Wiſdom, and Conſtancy of this Republick, which would never be obliged to become pliant, and flexible by all the fires of Hell, and damnation which the Pope could threaten. And indeed it farther appears, that as the Republick was of Opinion, that the Cenſures of the Pope were invalid, when they were not eſtabliſhed on juſt, and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal cauſes; ſo likewiſe they believed, that they could not depart from the leaſt ſcruple of their temporal Power which God had given them, without betraying that Truſt, which God had committed to their charge; and herein they were ſo reſolute and conſtant, that leſt they ſhould ſeem to acknowledg a fault in any one ſtep of the late tranſactions, they would not ſo much as accept of the Cardinals Bleſſing, leſt it ſhould ſeem to be given in form of Abſolution.</p>
               <p>This Controverſie being ended, which had hitherto allayed all the joy, and contentment which the Pope conceived for his late exaltation to the Papal Dignity: the <hi>Venetians</hi> in purſuance of the Articles agreed, diſpatched the four Ambaſſadours to <hi>Rome,</hi> namely <hi>Franciſco Molino</hi> Procurator of St. <hi>Mark, John Mocenigo, Peter Dudo, Franciſco Contareno,</hi> all Knights, and Senatours of Chief Renown; whom the Pope received with all imaginable honour, being overjoyed to have put an end to a buſineſs ſo full of danger to himſelf, and in which his meaſures having failed him, he no longer argued in defence of his Cauſe, nor entertained the Ambaſſadours with Expoſtulations concerning matters paſt, which having had little foundation in any reaſons, he was deſirous to preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and to have buried in ſilence.</p>
               <p>Soon after the promotion of this Pope, in the Month of <hi>November</hi> 1605. that diabolical Plot of the Gun-powder Treaſon to blow up the King and Queen of <hi>England,</hi> all the Nobles and Commons aſſembled in Parliament was happily, and by God's immediate Providence diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the particulars of which being recorded in our Chronicles, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, to have been contrived at <hi>Rome,</hi> we ſhall not need to relate in this place: onely that King <hi>James</hi> for ſecurity of himſelf and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:50681:358"/>
iſſued forth a Proclamation commanding all <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts, Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baker</hi>'s Hiſt.</note> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> as being the chief Incendiaries of troubles to depart the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and not to return upon pain of the ſeverity of thoſe Laws which were made againſt them: as alſo all Recuſants to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home to their Dwellings, and not to remain in <hi>London</hi> or come within ten miles of the Court without ſpecial Licenſe. After which Proclamation, the Oath of Allegiance was preſently adminiſtred to all ſorts of people, and their names certified to the Lords of the Council, who refuſed to take it. The form of this Oath adminiſtred to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants in <hi>England</hi> was brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and examined, and diſcuſſed by the College of Cardinals, who after mature, and ſerious deliberation did unanimouſly concur, that the ſaid Oath could not be lawfully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by any true Catholick with a ſafe Conſcience. Wherefore the Pope ſignified ſo much by his Brief, exhorting his people in <hi>England</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the ſaid Oath, and with patience, conſtancy, and faith to ſuffer thoſe perſecutions which for this cauſe were laid upon them.</p>
               <p>In the year 1607. the King of <hi>Congo</hi> ſent an Ambaſſadour to this Pope called <hi>Anthony Emanuel Vunthi,</hi> for ſo the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and other Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries into thoſe parts had named him; he was received honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Pope promiſed to furniſh him with ſeveral learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and godly Preachers, which ſhould return with him into his own Country, and there labour to encreaſe and propagate the Goſpel; but this Ambaſſadour falling ſick ſoon after his arrival at <hi>Rome,</hi> was buried in the Church of <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> and with him ceaſed the deſign of ſending Apoſtles into thoſe parts. Howſoever the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Goa,</hi> in imitation of the late Ambaſſadour from <hi>Congo,</hi> procured Letters from the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to this Pope dated at <hi>Spahaun</hi> the 20th. day of <hi>January</hi> 1608. and were afterwards followed by an Ambaſſadour called <hi>Ali Golikek Mordar,</hi> who arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> in the year 1609. and was received into the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where the Pope ſate on his Throne, and on each ſide the Cardinals in form, and manner of a Conſiſtory.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Writers who favour the Papal Cauſe, pretend that the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſent then to acknowledg Obedience to the Pope, who for that cauſe returned ſolemn thanks to God for having enlightned thoſe remote parts with the rays of his Goſpel, and that the Sun of Righteouſneſs was ariſen in thoſe parts, after ſo long a Night of obſcure Gentiliſm, and falſe Religion. But the ſucceſs of following times proved the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of this matter, the King's of <hi>Perſia</hi> continuing ſtill in the Doctrine of their Prophet <hi>Ali</hi>; and therefore it may with more reaſon be aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and believed, that this Ambaſſadour from <hi>Perſia,</hi> was ſent in favour and at the inſtigation of ſome of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Subjects, who were, or had been Chriſtians of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Church, which by ſome Friers crept in amongſt them had been ſeduced from their own to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; which was not difficult to perform, if we conſider the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of thoſe poor <hi>Armenians,</hi> who were eaſily inclined to the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Faith upon promiſes of preferments in the Church, ſo that until theſe days there are ſeveral Biſhops of the <hi>Roman</hi> rite in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and Monaſteries of <hi>Dominican</hi> Friers.</p>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 1610.</note> this Pope beatified <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> who was the firſt Founder, and Inſtitutor of the Order of <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> giving them leave and permiſſion amongſt themſelves and publickly in their own Churches

to invoke him as a Saint, or as one of thoſe happy Souls who live, and reign in Heaven with God; but not to be prayed unto, or invoked by the Univerſal Church. But with more Ceremony, and joy he canonized the ſame year <hi>Charles Borromeo</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Milan.</hi> In the time of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. the people of <hi>Milan</hi> had earneſtly deſired this grace, and had begun the methods, and rules of proceedings obſerved in that caſe, the which being continued until the time of this <hi>Paul</hi> V. were then at the deſire and requeſt of the Kings of <hi>Spain, Poland,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> as alſo of the College of Cardinals, and Biſhops of the Province of <hi>Milan,</hi> conſummated, and finiſhed with great pomp, and expence. In the Month of <hi>May</hi> of this year 1610. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. King of <hi>France</hi> was wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and traiterouſly aſſaſſinated by <hi>Ravillac,</hi> the particulars of which are ſpecified in the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtory, the which diabolical Act, as it aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the whole World, ſo it ſadly affected Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many Obligations from that King, being endeared to him by many late circumſtances in the Controverſie with <hi>Venice,</hi> and upon this ſcore he deeply lamented this unhappy fate, which he ſaid was a loſs to all Chriſtendom, and the Univerſal Church; and underſtanding that ſome young <hi>French</hi> Men, then at <hi>Rome</hi> rejoyced at the fact, and ſtiled the villanous Aſſaſſinate The Deliverer of their Country, he cauſed them to be ſeized, and upon Proceſs made againſt them, he condemned them to the Gallies. And though Popes do ſeldom aſſiſt at the Obſequies of deceaſed Princes, yet he was reſolved to be preſent at theſe, which were celebrated at <hi>Rome</hi> with great ſolemnity, where one <hi>Sequier</hi> preaching the funeral Sermon of this great Prince, he beſtowed on him theſe Titles of Praiſe, and Dignity, calling him The Protectour of the publick Peace, the Ornament of the Catholick, Apoſtolick, and <hi>Roman</hi> Church, the ſole Arbitrator between Chriſtian Kings and Princes, and the delight of the Univerſe; with which the Pope was ſo well affected, that he acknowledged all that was ſaid of him, to have been true, but yet that this Elogium came far ſhort of the merit of this great Prince.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe honours performed to the three forementioned Parties, he beatified <hi>Phillippus Nerius</hi> Founder of the Order of the <hi>Fathers of the Oratory,</hi> called in <hi>French Les peres d' Oratoire,</hi> and in <hi>Spain</hi> known by the name of <hi>Obſervantes Minores</hi>; as alſo the Virgin <hi>Tereſa,</hi> who for it inſtituted the Order of deſcalced <hi>Carmelites,</hi> with divers others.</p>
               <p>But now to enumerate the many publick works done by this Pope, we ſhall find none to have exceeded him in Magnificent Structures. For in the firſt place, he highly beautified the <hi>Vatican Baſilicon</hi> called by us the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> which being begun by <hi>Julius</hi> II. and amplified and encreaſed by <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. and <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. was not yet perfected until the time of this Pope, who by the help, and contrivance of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Angelo de Bonarora,</hi> cauſed the old Building of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to be demoliſhed, and began a moſt ſtupendous work, erecting from the very foundation the whole body of the Church from the Chappel of <hi>Gregory</hi> to the fartheſt end, building the Quire, Chancel, and both the lower and upper <hi>Portico,</hi> from whence the Pope on certain days bleſſed the People: and in remembrance whereof this Inſcription is engraven within the Church.</p>

               <p>But beſides this foregoing work of great Magnificence and charge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, he enlarged the <hi>Vatican</hi> Palace, adding ſeveral convenient Stairs, and paſſages into the Garden called <hi>the Bel vedere</hi>; by which in a more direct way he might paſs into it; for that Palace is ſaid to be ſo great, as to contain five thouſand ſix hundred and fifty Chambers: He alſo enlarged the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, and adorned it with the Pictures of many Men famous in their Ages, made, and drawn by excellent hands; to this Library he added a place to keep the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the ſecret tranſactions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea, which he called, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chivium Apoſtolicum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor did his Munificence end with this work, but with more State and charge he erected a Chappel called the Chappel of <hi>Burgheſe,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> dedicated to the Bleſſed Virgin; the outſide of which though built of Stone digged from Quarries on the banks of the <hi>Tybur,</hi> yet the inſide was enriched with <hi>Numidian,</hi> and <hi>Carian</hi> Marble, and with <hi>Granite</hi> Marble, and Alabaſter fetched from <hi>Chios,</hi> and <hi>Phrygia,</hi> the High Altar was ſupported with four lofty Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of Jaſper-ſtone beſet with Topaces, Rubies, Emeralds, Chryſolites, Onyx, Amethyſts, and divers other pretious Stones from <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>India:</hi> and dreſſed up the Image of our Lady upon it, with rich em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered Cloths, with Chains of Gold, and Pearl, and the rareſt Gems. To this Chappel he gave a Croſs of Silver weighing one hundred twenty eight pounds, coſting two thouſand one hundred and fifty Ducats; He alſo erected the Statues of the Twelve Apoſtles in Silver, which coſt ſix thouſand Ducats of Gold, with ſix ſilver Candleſticks gilded, which coſt three thouſand Crowns: alſo two maſſy Candleſticks of Silver, which were placed at the foot of the high Altar, weighing one hundred and fourteen pounds, and coſt one thouſand four hundred Ducats of Gold. Moreover, he gave the heads of ſix Saints in Silver, which coſt two thouſand and thirty Ducats, and the Arms of ſix Saints, which coſt one thouſand two hundred Ducats; and alſo two Silver Baſons, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twenty three pounds, and which coſt five hundred pieces of Eight, the Crown which he beſtowed on the Image ſtudded with precious Stones, was valued at twelve thouſand Ducats of Gold, before which
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:50681:359"/>
was hanged a Lamp of Silver weighing thirty one pounds, with many other rare and rich gifts, which amounted in all to 31725 Ducats of Gold. I remember my ſelf to have ſeen, and obſerved this Chappel with great admiration, and particularly noted the four Pillars of <hi>Jaſpar</hi> and Baſes of Braſs, and that the back of the Altar was all of <hi>Lapis Lazuli,</hi> and the Cupolo of the Chappel was painted by <hi>Guido Rheni</hi> of <hi>Bologna:</hi> this Chappel is juſt oppoſite to another built by <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. the chief Architect, of which was <hi>Domenico Fontana,</hi> and coſt ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Crowns, they are both additions to the <hi>Sancta Maria Maggiore,</hi> which is one of the greateſt Churches in <hi>Rome,</hi> it is ſeated on <hi>Mons Eſquilinus,</hi> and by ſome is nam'd <hi>Sancta Maria ad Nives,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in the heats of the month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> it was revealed in a Viſion to thoſe, who firſt founded this Church, that they ſhould build it in that place where at that ſeaſon they found Snow, which it ſeems appeared within the compaſs of that Church, and gave meaſures for all the dimenſions of it, there being no Snow in any other part of all the City or Country.</p>
               <p>And in regard the <hi>Vatican</hi> Palace was eſteemed to be ſituate in an unhealthy Air, and almoſt peſtilential in the heats of the Summer, it was accuſtomary for the Popes in the hot ſeaſon of the year to remove themſelves to a ſmall Houſe on the <hi>Mons Quirinus,</hi> hiring to the great inconvenience of the Inhabitants, ſeveral Houſes for accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Servants, and followers of the Court. But this Pope <hi>Paul</hi> who was of a great and large Soul, not enduring to be confin'd within ſo narrow a compaſs; bought ſeveral Houſes belonging to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, the which having pulled down, he in the place thereof erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that large and ſtately Palace, now called <hi>Monte Cavallo,</hi> from the two Horſes which are erected on a Pedeſtal before this Palace; in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of which Building on the Eaſtern ſide thereof there is this Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption engraved,

There was no Pope that was ever more magnificent in Building than this, or who delighted more in publick Works, which tended to the common benefit of the City, either for uſe or Ornament; for he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged the ways on the Mount <hi>Quirinus</hi> leading to this Palace, which were before very narrow and inconvenient, and brought ſeveral Aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts to it with plentiful ſtreams; many ſtreets of the City which were before crooked, he made direct and ſtreight with much Beauty and Ornament. All that part of the City which is ſituate on the other ſide of the <hi>Tybur</hi> called at preſent <hi>Fraſtevere,</hi> ſuffering much for want of Water, he refreſhed with admirable Streams flowing in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, <hi>Ex Agro Braccianenſi,</hi> which he brought by Aqueducts at thirty five miles diſtance, partly under ground, and part with arched Work; which was divided into four Fountains, or rather Rivers of Water, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from the top of that Hill where is now a Church, and Monaſtery of <hi>Franiſcan</hi> Friers: and there they ſhewed us a Chappel built over that place, where St. <hi>Peter,</hi> (as they ſaid) was crucified, and the very
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:50681:360"/>
hole where his Croſs was fixed. On the high Altar of this Church, was that excellent and famed Piece of our Saviour's Aſcenſion made by <hi>Raphael <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi>; he was himſelf ſo pleaſed with it, and ſo much admired it, that he ordered it ſhould be carried next to his Coffin when he went to be buried.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe, and many other publick Works which this Pope per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, he was much to be commended for his charitable Gifts, and Alms to the Poor; amongſt which it was none of his leaſt acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that he eſtabliſhed a Revenue, out of which every month there was raiſed a convenient Portion whereby to beſtow an honeſt and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Maid in Marriage. He was greatly pleaſed with <hi>Freſcati,</hi> a Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage about ten miles diſtant from <hi>Rome,</hi> called anciently <hi>Villa Tuſculana,</hi> where <hi>Cicero</hi> was much delighted, and made it the place of his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Studies; and for that reaſon this Pope enlarged the Papal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace there, and brought it into great reputation with the Cardinals, and Nobles of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the Wars between the Emperour and the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which happened in the Reign of this Pope, he laid a Tax on all the Clergy towards the maintenance and ſupport of the Catholick Cauſe: and a new Order of Knighthood was created under the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of the Bleſſed Virgin, St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and St. <hi>Francis,</hi> who entered into a Vow to make War againſt the Hereticks, and extirpate them and the Hereſies they profeſſed: And about this time began that great Controverſie between the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> concerning the immaculate Conception of the Bleſſed Virgin, which was rather ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, than decided.</p>
               <p>Thus did this Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. paſs his time in Peace; for the quarrel he had with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> having given him ſome taſte of the inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of War, he ever afterwards attended to a pacifick and repoſed Life, which produced thoſe excellent effects of Peace, ſuch as great Structures, and munificence towards the Poor, which by unquiet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are always diverted by the expences of War: And thus having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his days, he departed this life on the 24th. of <hi>January</hi> 1621. and in the ſeventieth year of his Age, having reigned fifteen years, eight months and thirteen days, he was buried for a while in the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but his Body was in a ſhort time after removed from thence to his Chappel, which he had erected and added to the great Church of <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore.</hi> During his Reign he created ſixty Cardinals.</p>

When the firſt Scrutiny was made <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had far the greater number of Votes, but falling ſhort of two Thirds he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>Campori</hi> made the greater buſtle, and ſo alſo did <hi>Aquino,</hi> but great and ſtrong Parties oppoſing againſt them vacated their Elections. At length Cardinal <hi>Borgheſe</hi> naming <hi>Ludoviſio,</hi> was followed by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral concurrence of almoſt all the Cardinals, almoſt we may ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Campori</hi> upon the news thereof, turned pale and ready to fall into a ſwoon, <hi>Aldobrandino</hi> alſo and <hi>Aquino</hi> fell ſick, and were carried out of the <hi>Conclave</hi>; and <hi>Aquino</hi> having now loſt all hopes of being made Pope, took it ſo grievouſly to heart, that in two days he depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this life. Thus <hi>Ludoviſio</hi> being elected, he was conducted into the Chappel <hi>Parlina,</hi> where he was veſted in his Pontificalibus, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, and adored for Pope on the 21th. of <hi>February</hi> 1621. and took the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> XV.</p>
               <p>This Pope was born at <hi>Bologna</hi> on the third of <hi>January</hi> 1554. his Father was Count <hi>Pompeo Ludoviſio,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Camilla Blanchina,</hi> he was in his youthful years educated in the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Colledg at <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was inſtructed in all ſorts of Humane and Philoſophical Learning: returning afterwards to <hi>Bologna</hi> he ſtudied the Civil Law, in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:50681:361"/>
which he arrived to the degree of Doctor, and thence again ſetling himſelf at <hi>Rome,</hi> he gained the friendſhip of three ſucceeding Popes: by <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. he was choſen and created Principal Judg of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol</hi>; by <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. he was made Referendary of both Signatures, and preſided in all Civil Cauſes, in the place of Deputy to Cardinal <hi>Ruſticuccio</hi> the Pope's Vicar; he was afterwards aſſumed into Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with the Auditors of the <hi>Rota,</hi> which Office one of his Anceſtors named <hi>Lodowick Ludoviſio,</hi> had about one hundred and fifty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with great ſatisfaction, and prudence admitted. He was likewiſe by the ſame <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. adjoyned in Commiſſion with <hi>Maffeo Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barini</hi> Clerk of the Apoſtolical Chamber, (who afterwards was Pope) and ſent to <hi>Beneventum</hi> to appeaſe Tumults and Seditions ariſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Officers of the Pope, and thoſe of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And laſtly <hi>Paul</hi> V. created him Arch-biſhop of <hi>Bologna</hi>; upon promotion to which Prelacy, he wrote a Letter to his Dioceſans full of Charity, and paternal affection, which was printed at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and is extant at this day. About this time a War was begun between <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> grounded on certain diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences about ſome places in the Dutchy of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which were the cauſe of great trouble in <hi>Milan,</hi> and other places of <hi>Italy,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that <hi>Philip</hi> III. King of <hi>Spain</hi> took part with the Duke of <hi>Mantoua:</hi> to appeaſe which diſturbances, and compoſe which differences Pope <hi>Paul</hi> employed this <hi>Alexander Ludoviſio,</hi> qualifying him with the Title of his <hi>Nuntio</hi> in thoſe three Provinces to confer with the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; in which negotiation he ſo well acquitted himſelf, and with ſuch honour towards the Papal Sea, that Peace being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and all Diſputes ended, the Pope in reward of the pains and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Ludoviſio,</hi> on the 20th. of <hi>November</hi> 1616. promoted him to the degree of Cardinal, with which Title he reſided in his Dioceſe, until news came of the death of <hi>Paul</hi> V; when he immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to <hi>Rome,</hi> and entred the <hi>Conclave,</hi> on the 8th. of <hi>February</hi> with the other Cardinal, and on the 21th. of that month was himſelf crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pope.</p>
               <p>Some few days after which, being crowned in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church with the uſual pomp, he took poſſeſſion of the Sovereign Power of the Church in the Church of St. <hi>John de Lateran:</hi> which Ceremonies being paſt, he publiſhed Jubilies, and Pardons over all Chriſtendom to all ſuch, who ſhould with ſincere minds pray for the proſperity and happineſs of his Reign.</p>
               <p>At this time a War began to be inflamed between the Inhabitants and Neighbours of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> in which the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> became involved, the cauſes and original of which doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to this Hiſtory: <hi>Spain</hi> being deſirous to intereſt <hi>Gregory</hi> in this Cauſe, offered to depoſite the Forts of the <hi>Valteline</hi> in his hands, making great oſtentations of their deſires to Peace and quietneſs: but in <hi>Rome</hi> the Opinions and Counſels upon an offer of ſuch importance were doubtful, and divided; for thoſe who penetrated the moſt deeply into matters of Policy, were not willing that the Authority of the Church and Power of the Pope ſhould be ſo far engaged, or that the profeſſed neutrality, and mediation ſhould run ſo much hazard, for that being once accepted by the Pope, the Conditions of Peace would
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:50681:361"/>
be rendered more difficult, and perhaps impoſſible: for if in caſe an agreement ſhould happen between two Kings of reſtoring all things to their former eſtate; it would be difficult to conceive with what decency the Pope could reſtore into the hands of the Proteſtants, (whom he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed Hereticks) thoſe places which were committed to his Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianſhip and cuſtody. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Republick being of the ſame O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion ſent <hi>Soranzo</hi> Ambaſſadour Extraordinary to <hi>Rome</hi> to diſuade the Pope from lending his Name, and Authority to the intereſts of <hi>Spain:</hi> but he yielding an Ear to his Nephews, who were overcome by Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Benefices from <hi>Spain,</hi> was poſſeſſed with an Opinion and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that at the appearing of his Colours, all the Arms of the Enemy, would out of Veneration fall from their hands; upon which the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious memorial of Peace preſerved, and Religion protected would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as an Ornament to his Name, and a Crown upon his Sepulcre. But the <hi>French</hi> ſhewed themſelves diſpleaſed, that <hi>Gregory</hi> had not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the ſence of that Crown upon the matter, before he reſolved to accept the Depoſite: howſoever in the <hi>French</hi> Councils the Opinion prevailed, that the Pope ſhould accept of the Depoſite with certain li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations and reſerves; and it was declared, <hi>that the Depoſite ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main until the end of</hi> July (it being now the month of <hi>May</hi>) <hi>within which time, the Forts being demoliſhed, and all reſtraints upon the</hi> Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>and Armies removed which did oppreſs them, affairs ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their former State; which not being performed, the League ſhould ſupplicate the Pope to join himſelf to their Arms, thereby to obtain the effect.</hi> In purſuance of theſe reſolutions the Duke of <hi>Fiano</hi> the Pope's own Brother, a dull and ſottiſh Man, was ſent with fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and five hundred Horſe to take poſſeſſion of the Towns to be depoſited; but had been reſiſted in the Valley had not the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> removed all obſtacles, but theſe matters came to no maturity: for amidſt theſe tranſactions the Pope departed this life.</p>
               <p>In the year 1622. <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. of <hi>France</hi> was involved in great Wars againſt his Proteſtant Subjects, and rendered himſelf Maſter of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Poictou, Xantonge, Gaſcony, Dauphino,</hi> and <hi>Languedoc. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> IV. King of <hi>Spain</hi> was employed in Wars againſt the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> likewiſe the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II. waged Wars with the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany,</hi> and with aſſiſtance of Marquis <hi>Spinola,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> deſpoiled the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine</hi> of his Dominions; and having the plunder of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſent the Library antiently belonging to the Princes <hi>Palatines</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> which by this Pope was tranſmitted into the <hi>Vatican</hi> with this Inſcription: <hi>Sum De Bibliotheca Quam Heidelberga Capta Spolium Fecit, Et Pont. Max. Greg.</hi> XV. <hi>Trophaeum Miſit, Maximilianus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>triuſque Bavariae Dux S.R. Imperii Archi-Dapifer Et Princeps Elector Anno</hi> M.DCXXIII. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, ſeveral Standards taken at the Battel of <hi>Prague</hi> were ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there by the Pope's order hanged up, in the Church of <hi>Sancta Maria de Victoria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſucceſs of the Catholick Princes being to the great comfort of the Pope thus fortunate, he encouraged the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to make War upon <hi>Geneva,</hi> and render himſelf Maſter of that place, whereby he would not only do juſtice to his own Right and Title, but alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the capital Seat of Hereſie, and <hi>Calviniſm.</hi> With the like zeal
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:50681:362"/>
did the Pope require of the four <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadours, ſent according to cuſtom to congratulate his promotion to the Papal Chair; that the Republick would again admit into their State thoſe Religious People of the Society of Jeſus, which had been baniſhed from thence in the time of his Predeceſſor <hi>Paul</hi> V. But this requeſt being repugnant to many Laws and formalities, and the indiſſoluble bonds of Government, could not be obtained; though it was preſſed more home by the Marquis <hi>de Coevre,</hi> who paſſed from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> in the name of his Maſter King <hi>Lewis</hi> III. and ſeconded with earneſt importunity by the Biſhop of <hi>Monte Fiaſcorie</hi> the Pope's Nuntio, and the powerful Letters of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Ludoviſio.</hi> For the Senate declared, that they could not depart from their firſt reſolution, which being founded on Decrees, and ſolid conſiderations could in no wiſe be altered; and therefore Princes in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with them, ought not to preſs them unto that, which was neither permitted to them to grant, nor could they deny without doing a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to themſelves.</p>

               <p>In this year alſo <hi>Antonius de Dominis,</hi> who was Arch-biſhop of <hi>Spala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> deſerting his Biſhoprick and all his Eccleſiaſtical Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the ſake of the Goſpel, and the true Proteſtant Religion, went into <hi>England,</hi> where he wrote a Book againſt the Eccleſiaſtical State: but being unconſtant, and wavering in his Principles, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Rome</hi> where he renounced all the Principles of the Proteſtant Faith; and yet afterwards in the year 1624. in the time of <hi>

               <p>The Congregation <hi>de Propaganda Fide</hi> was firſt inſtituted by this <hi>Gregory</hi> V. as appears by his Letters Patents for the ſame dated the 10th. of <hi>July</hi> 1622. and for maintenance thereof he ſetled a certain Revenue to ſupport ſuch, as employed themſelves in that important work.</p>
               <p>In the ſame year alſo he canonized <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> firſt Founder of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> who was formerly beatified; likewiſe <hi>Philip Neri</hi> Founder of the <hi>Oratorians,</hi> called in <hi>French, les Peres d' Oratoire,</hi> with <hi>Iſidore</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who had been a Husbandman, <hi>Tereſia</hi> a Nun that reformed the Order of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> and <hi>Francis Xaverius</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit,</hi> whom they call <hi>Apoſtle of the Indies.</hi>

               <p>Moreover, this Pope at the inſtance and deſire of King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. advanced the Biſhoprick of <hi>Paris</hi> to be an Arch-biſhoprick.</p>
               <p>But what is more obſervable in his time, was a Diploma, which he made for the more orderly, and eaſie Election of Popes by way of ſecret Suffrages, which divers had attempted to perform, but could never be perfected until this Pope wrote and publiſhed the ſame, the which Rule was afterwards practiſed at the Election of <hi>

                  <hi>Sunday,</hi> and the day of the Feſtival obſerved in remembrance of the Transfiguration of Chriſt, they all concurred with common Voice in the Election of <hi>Maffeo Barberini,</hi> who was the fourth Pope, which the City of <hi>Florence</hi> had given to the Church, namely three of the Houſe of <hi>Medicis, Aldobrandino,</hi> and this <hi>Barberini</hi> who was the fifth. This Pope was of the age of fifty ſix years when he was choſen; much to the wonder of the Electors themſelves, who were amazed to have deceived their own hopes by promoting a Perſon, who for his complexion, and vigour might out live the greater part of them.</p>
               <p>This Family of <hi>Barberini</hi> had flouriſhed for the ſpace of five hundred years in the little Republick of <hi>Simi-Fontana,</hi> which was ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Siena,</hi> and not above two miles diſtant from the Town of <hi>Barberini:</hi> but this Republick being afterwards deſtroyed by the <hi>Florentines,</hi> the Family of <hi>Barberini</hi> tranſplanted themſelves to the City of <hi>Florence,</hi> where they lived with great honour and eſteem, and being employed in honourable places of charge and truſt, they rendred their Houſe moſt illuſtrious by their faithfulneſs, and dexterous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs.</p>
               <p>But it will not be pertinent to our purpoſe to enumerate the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Men of this Family; we ſhall onely name <hi>Antonio Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi> who was the firſt of this name, who ſetled his Houſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> and was the Father of two Sons <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Antonio.</hi> This latter was the Father of our <hi>Maffeo</hi> who was born at <hi>Florence</hi> the fifth day of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> 1568. he had five Brothers, three of which died in their youth, but two of them had the ſatisfaction to ſee <hi>Maffeo</hi> inſtalled in the Papal Throne, one of which being a <hi>Capuchin,</hi> was called from his Cell to the College of Cardinals, and dignified by his Brother with the Title of St. <hi>Onufrio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to <hi>Maffeo,</hi> having been carefully educated in his youth, and having applied himſelf to all ſorts of Learning, and Vertue; he was ſo greatly beloved, and admired by <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. that at the age of twenty one years, he was made Abreviator of the principal Tribunal of Juſtice, and <hi>Gregory</hi> XIV. conferred on him the Signet Office for Grants of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Grace. <hi>Clement</hi> V. ſent him to <hi>Fano</hi> to be chief Governour of that City and of the Marches of <hi>Ancona,</hi> where by his modeſty, and ſweetneſs of his carriage he acquired the friendſhip, and good will of all the Inhabitants of thoſe parts. Afterwards he was made one of the ſeven Pronotaries of the Records of <hi>Rome</hi>; in execution of which Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, he faithfully delivered in writing all the particular Acts, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies obſerved at the two illuſtrious Marriages celebrated at <hi>Ferrara</hi> between <hi>Philip</hi> III. King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi>; as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Albert</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and <hi>Iſabella Clara Eugenia Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain:</hi> and being made afterwards Clerk of the Apoſtolical Chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was joyned in Commiſſion with <hi>Alexander Ludoviſio</hi> Auditor of the <hi>Rota</hi>; with whom it was his good fortune to compoſe the Differences which aroſe about the limits, and borders of the Eccleſiaſtical State, and the Dominions of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> in determination of which, the Propoſals, and offers of <hi>Maffeo</hi> were applauded, and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the great contentment and ſatisfaction of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. who afterwards ſent him in quality of his Nuntio into <hi>France,</hi> to carry the Bleſſed Clouts to the <hi>Dauphin</hi> who was born in the year 1601. and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:50681:363"/>
to his Father <hi>Henry</hi> IV. with the name of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. On this occaſion <hi>Maffeo</hi> obtained the re-eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who had been baniſhed from thence in the year 1594.</p>
               <p>Having thus acquitted himſelf with great honour in <hi>France,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to <hi>Rome</hi>; from whence he was again ſent into <hi>France</hi> with the character of Nuntio in Ordinary, Cardinal <hi>Bubalo</hi> (who had held that place formerly) being recalled from thence. Upon receiving this charge, <hi>Maffeo</hi> was farther dignified with the Title of Arch-biſhop of <hi>Nazaret</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples; Clement</hi> VIII. being dead, as was alſo his Succeſſour <hi>Leo</hi> XI. <hi>Maffeo</hi> was ſtill continued by <hi>Paul</hi> V. in his Office of Nuntio; but in the year 1607. after the differences between that Pope, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> were compoſed, he was recalled to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he received the honour of the Cardinals Hat in <hi>October</hi> of the ſame year with Title of St. <hi>Peter de Monte Aureo,</hi> which he afterwards changed for that of S. <hi>Onufrio,</hi> and kept the ſame until the time that he was elected Pope, when he conferred it on his Brother, as we have before-mentioned. After he was Cardinal, he was conſtituted the Pope's Legat at <hi>Bologna</hi> where he reſided for the ſpace of three years; he was Protectour of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation; and having reſigned his Arch-biſhoprick of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> he was created Biſhop of <hi>Spoleto,</hi> where he kept his reſidence, and ordered all matters according to the Orders, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Council of <hi>Trent:</hi> and to keep up the force of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Canons, he erected a Congregation of Caſuiſts, by whom all difficult, and doubtful Caſes were explicated, and determined.</p>
               <p>He was alſo a Man of that great Vertue, and Learning, that his Houſe was a <hi>Muſaeum,</hi> and the <hi>Aſylum</hi> of vertuous and learned Men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch Strangers with great humanity, who were Perſons of parts and Learning. Wherefore <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. declared him Patron, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and all the Oriental Nations, who coming to <hi>Rome</hi> repreſented their Cauſes and Conditions without the help, and interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Interpreter. And thus <hi>Maffeo Barberini</hi> having made many ſteps in the degrees of Honour, and prepared himſelf for the Pontifical Dignity by the many Services he had rendered to the Eccleſiaſtical State; his turn came to aſcend unto the Popedom; for (as we have ſaid) <hi>Gregory</hi> being deceaſed, this <hi>Barberini</hi> was on the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> elected Pope, taking the name of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. with applauſe of the World by reaſon of the high conceit then had of his Learning, and Ability.</p>
               <p>The Pope ſoon after his Election fell ſick of a violent Fever cauſed by the inconveniencies he had ſuffered in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> and the unhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Air, to the great grief, and fear of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> who being extreamly rejoyced with his Election, were much dejected with the danger of his death; but being recovered again, he took this Motto: <hi>In Domino ſperans non Infirmabor.</hi> He was of the age of fifty five years, when he was firſt elected; at which time before he would retire to cloath himſelf in his Pontifical Veſtments, he proſtrated himſelf before the Altar, and with tears did earneſtly intreat of God, that in caſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Omniſcient Providence, he foreſaw that he were unequal for ſo great a charge, or ſhould not prove an uſeful Inſtrument to the Church, that he would rather be pleaſed to ſtrike him dead, than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to go forth, and cloath himſelf with thoſe hallowed Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. After which, as if he would aſcribe all to the glory of God,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:50681:364"/>
he ſtamped this Motto on his Coyn: <hi>Facit mirabilia magna ſolus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſickneſs of the Pope was the cauſe that his Coronation was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred until the 29th. of <hi>September,</hi> which was the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel, whom the Popes commonly have taken for their Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angel. <hi>Alexander d' Eſte</hi> Prince of the Cardinal Deacons had the honour to plant the triple Crown upon his head, at which time the people made loud ſhouts, and acclamations. And now <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> having a particular devotion for St. <hi>Michael,</hi> he erected the Image of that Angel in Braſs upon the Altar of <hi>Sancta Petronella</hi> in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, and his own perſon on his knees in an humble poſture before him with theſe words: <hi>Te Mane, Te Veſpere.</hi> And becauſe it was the cuſtom for Popes on the 19th. of <hi>November</hi> to go in Proceſſion from the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> to St. <hi>John de Lateran,</hi> he performed that Cuſtom with ſuch Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, beyond what was uſual, that one <hi>Maſcardus</hi> thought it worthy his deſcription in a particular Treatiſe of that pompous Subject; in memory of which the People of <hi>Rome</hi> erected a Triumphal Arch in the <hi>Capitol</hi> with this Inſcription on the one ſide thereof:</p>

               <p>At the beginning of his Pontificate he confirmed the Decree of <hi>Pius</hi> V. againſt alienation of Church-Lands, as alſo of the Towns, Places and Demeſnes belonging to the Church. And for imploring the bleſſing of God on his Rule and Government: He ordered Prayers of forty hours continuance to be held in the Churches of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> and St. <hi>Mary ad praeſepe,</hi> vulgarly called <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> and in two other Churches in ſeveral quarters of the City. He inſtituted alſo a new Order of Militia with the Title of <hi>Knights of the Conception of our Lady,</hi> who took the Vow, and obſerved the Rules of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> under the protection of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and St. <hi>Baſil.</hi> This Order was firſt honoured by <hi>Charles Gonzaga,</hi> and <hi>

Of this Order were ſeventy Knights, whoſe Banner was a Red Croſs, carrying a Flag faſtned to it with a Golden Chain, in which was a bright Image of the Virgin with the Devil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her feet with theſe words: <hi>Vince Hoc Inſigni Vere Noſtro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further at the beginning of his Reign, he appointed a ſelect number of religious, and grave Men to viſit all the Monaſteries both of Men, and Women, as alſo all Colleges, and Hoſpitals, and other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick places, to take an account, and knowledg of the abuſes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders committed therein, and to give their Opinions and advices for

a redreſs of them: and of their proceedings herein, their Inſtructions were to render weekly an account unto the Pope.</p>
               <p>He exhorted alſo all Biſhops to reſide in their reſpective Dioceſes: and not to excuſe the Cardin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now according to the Bull of <hi>Paul</hi> II. reducing the Jubilies to every twenty five years; the time was return'd in this year 1625.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1625.</note> for a Jubily, the laſt having been held in the year 1600. under <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. To make a preparation hereunto, a Bull was iſſued under the date of the 29th. of <hi>April</hi> 1624. to adviſe the World that the following year was the holy year of Jubily, that ſo all thoſe who were deſirous to gain the benefit of Indulgences, might have timely notice ſo to diſpoſe their Affairs, as with convenience to repair to the Holy City, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the fruits of the Holy year; and accordingly on the 24th. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 1624. he opened the Holy Gate, in conformity to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies deſcribed in other places.</p>
               <p>But before the beginning of this Jubily the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſent their Ambaſſadours to kiſs the Pope's feet, and make tender of their Obedience to the Apoſtolical Sea, the like was performed by Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours from the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> the Republicks of <hi>Genoua, Luca,</hi> and other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi>: And when in the month of <hi>July</hi> 1625. the Ambaſſadours from the Catholick King came to perform their Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, <hi>Don Bartolines de Caſtro</hi> uttered himſelf in this manner. <hi>By this Man</hi> (meaning the Duke of <hi>Alcala</hi> who was Ambaſſador in chief) who is

Howſoever, in favour to Pilgrims the Pope thought ſit to continue the benefit, and priviledg of his Indulgences until the firſt day of the year 1626.</p>
               <p>And now the Pope, who at the beginning of his Pontificate had created <hi>Francis Barberino</hi> his Nephew Cardinal Deacon of St. <hi>Onufrio</hi>; was ſtill deſigning greater honours for him; and in the year 1624. gave him the Title of Cardinal of St. <hi>Agatha,</hi> and made him Pretor of the Cities of <hi>Tiburtia,</hi> and <hi>Firmiana,</hi> Patron, and Protector of <hi>Aragon, Portugal, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. Library-keeper of the Apoſtolical Sea, and Vice-Chancellour of the Holy Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; and farther to exalt him with higher honours, in the year 1625. he ſent him into <hi>France</hi> with the character of <hi>Legat à Latere,</hi> and to make his reception more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, he diſpatched <hi>Bernardino Mari</hi> a Patrician of <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to intreat <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. that he would be pleaſed to receive his Nephew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that degree, and quality. At his departure from <hi>Rome</hi> the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him a Croſs with his Benediction; and the Cardinals accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him to the gate of St. <hi>Angelo.</hi> At his arrival in the Suburbs of <hi>Paris,</hi> he was viſited in the name of the King and Queen by the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and other chief Peers of <hi>France</hi>; and at his entry he was accompanied by the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the King's only Brother with a great train of Nobility of the firſt rank, and Order in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. This Legat who was young and but lately admitted into the Order of Prieſthood reſerved his firſt Maſs, wherewith to treat the King, and Queen, which he offered to them as the firſt fruits of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifices, celebrating it at <hi>Fontainbleau</hi> on the 15th. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which is the day of the Feſtival of the Aſſumption of our Lady.</p>
               <p>Being returned afterwards to <hi>Rome,</hi> his preſence was deſired by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> III. King of <hi>Spain</hi> under the ſame quality, and character at his Court, to be Godfather in place of the Pope to the Daughter of the King, who was afterwards baptized with the name of <hi>Maria Clara Eugenia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But not to confer all the ſtock of honour on one ſingle perſon of his Kinred, the Pope called <hi>Anthony Barberini</hi> his other Nephew, Son of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Brother from his <hi>Capuchin</hi>'s Cell, to rank him together with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals; it was he, who was called for a long time Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> he was eſteemed a very upright Man, and one who obſerved the rules of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> notwithſtanding that his degree of Cardinal excuſed him in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from the ſeverity of them. During the abſence of <hi>Franciſco Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berino</hi> in <hi>France, Antonio</hi> was Chief Miniſter with the Pope in his ſtead, which at his return, he did moſt voluntarily reſign into the hands of <hi>Franciſco</hi>; in the execution of which, it is reported of him, that he would never be preſent at the conſultations of War, which at that time
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:50681:365"/>
infeſted <hi>Italy</hi> upon a Diſpute concerning the <hi>Valteline,</hi> ſaying, that his Order obliged him to the exerciſe of Peace, and works of Charity, the affairs of War being incompatible with his Vow, and his Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>In the year 1626. this Pope had the honour to conſecrate the great <hi>Baſilicon</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, which having been created by <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Great, was afterwards enlarged and adorned by the munificence of many other Popes; and now being compleatly finiſhed by this, he with great Pomp in preſence, and with the aſſiſtance of twenty two Cardinals, of which three were Biſhops, performed all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and rites of conſecration; in memory of which this Inſcription was engraven over the Walls:</p>

                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:50681:366"/>Now as to matters of political Government, and his management thereof: the Pope found himſelf much engaged by <hi>Gregory</hi> his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour, who, (as we have ſaid in his life) had accepted the <hi>Valteline</hi> in Depoſite; which bringing an unſeaſonable charge upon him, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained thereof, but found no way to get out, for <hi>Ludoviſio</hi> had ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tied the knot, both of buſineſs, and decency. And though <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> by reaſon of employments exerciſed in <hi>France,</hi> was judged inclinable, and in a manner partial to that Court, yet it was fit that he ſhould appear ſerviceable, at leaſt in name to the deſigns of <hi>Spain</hi>; and indeed he was ſo in reality; for though the Depoſite of the <hi>Valteline</hi> was ſaid to be in the hands of the Pope, yet <hi>Leopold</hi> continued in poſſeſſion, and enjoyed the conveniencies and advantages, and the <hi>Griſons</hi> groaned under the burden, to remedy which the Pope propoſed divers expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, but the preliminary to all, and his chief condition, was a reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſement of the Money which he had expended, before he would quit or part with his Truſt. The Confederates readily accepted the proffer, and willingly would have reimburſed the Pope, provided the Valley were put into their hands, and rendred to the firſt Owner when the Forts were razed, and Religion reſtored. But the Pope being fearful to offend <hi>Spain,</hi> propoſed, that a ſtrong body of Soldiery belonging to the <hi>Valteline</hi> ſhould be razed, and united either to the Catholick <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> of <hi>Helvetia,</hi> or as a fourth League to the three <hi>Cantons</hi> of the <hi>Griſons.</hi> But the Confederates propoſing to themſelves the end of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring things to their former ſtate, judged, that by theſe means, they ſhould be wanting to the protection, which they had promiſed to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould ſtill enjoy the predominancy, and liberty of paſſage to the excluſion of all others: upon which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and ſeveral others, the Diſpute ſtill continued until the year 1627, when the Pope acquainted the Cardinals in a full Conſiſtory, that the Diſputes, and Wars ariſen about the <hi>Valteline</hi> were compoſed, and ended, on the conditions, that the Fortifications of thoſe places which were committed to his Truſt, were by conſent of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to be ruined and demoliſhed. To which he added theſe words: <hi>At length</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>we have attained that which we much wiſhed, and deſired, for by mutual conſent of both Kings, the Peace is concluded, and eſtabliſhed; we have omitted nothing, which might conduce to the good of the Church, and it hath been our principal care that the Catholick Religion ſhould ſuffer no detriment, the Kings themſelves are witneſſes hereof, and God himſelf knows, that we have always had his glory, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour before our eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now that the Grandeur of the Apoſtolical Chair be advanced, and the Conſiſtory gratified and pleaſed; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> in the year 1631. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the Title of <hi>Eminence</hi> upon the Cardinals, forbidding them to receive any other diſtinction of honour, and for eſtabliſhment thereof a Decree was made and entred into the Records of the Congregation of Ceremonies that the Titles of <hi>Cardinals</hi> ſhould be, the moſt Eminent and moſt Reverend; but as to the Order of the Knights of St. <hi>George</hi> inſtituted by <hi>Paul</hi> V. he wholly aboliſhed it. The <hi>Illyrian</hi> Colledg founded at <hi>Loreto</hi> by <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. but tranſlated afterwards to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. conſiſting in all but of twelve perſons, he reſtored again to <hi>Loreto</hi> with augmentation of the Revenue, and of the Scholars
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:50681:366"/>
to the number of thirty ſix. And in regard his hand was now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in giving, and taking away Honours, he was pleaſed to declare, that the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> was a crowned Head, and was to be treated with a Dignity equal to that of Kings.</p>
               <p>About this time great combuſtions, and terrible Wars threatned <hi>Italy</hi>; for the Houſe of <hi>Gonzaga</hi> which reigned in <hi>Mantua,</hi> was now conſidered without iſſue male, and as a dead Corps without hopes of any branches ſpringing from thence, neither could <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the elder Brother, nor <hi>Vincenzo</hi> the preſent Duke leave after them any other, than the young Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> their Niece, who as a Woman was excluded from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture of the Dutchy, had yet ſome reaſon, though doubtful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to that of <hi>Montferrat.</hi> In her marriage therefore the pledges of Peace, or the ſeeds of great contention ſeeming to be lodged, many believed it expedient to marry her to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Rhetel,</hi> Son of the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> the neareſt and lawful Heir: for this Branch, though tranſplanted to a forein Soil, was ſprung from the ſame Root, enjoying in <hi>France</hi> the revenue of three large Dukedoms, <hi>viz. Nevers, Rhetel,</hi> and <hi>Maine.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> who were jealous of this Houſe, and above any thing apprehended this Succeſſion, leſt it ſhould introduce the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> promiſed the pretenſions of <hi>Ferrand</hi> Prince of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalla,</hi> a branch alſo of the Houſe of <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> but derived farther than that of <hi>Nevers</hi>; but by how much the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> favoured <hi>Guaſtalla</hi> with benefits, and declarations, by ſo much the more was <hi>France</hi> earneſt to ſtrengthen the rights of <hi>Nevers</hi>; with whom the <hi>Venetians</hi> alſo concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Opinion, put the Duke in mind to eſtabliſh the Succeſſion in his life-time, and therewith confirm the Peace of <hi>Italy.</hi> Nor was <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> leſs attentive to his intereſt, and game, than the others, deſigning upon the death of <hi>Vincenzo,</hi> (now crazy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, not ſo much with age, as with riot, and luxurious living) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive his pretended title to <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and colour it with the marriage of <hi>Mary</hi> to his Son <hi>Maurice.</hi> To pervent which, <hi>Vincenzo</hi> with great ſecrecy called to him <hi>Rhetel,</hi> that he might marry him to the Princeſs, declaring him immediately upon his arrival Lieutenant General, and his Heir by ſolemn Teſtament: To perfect this Marriage nothing was now wanting, but the Pope's Diſpenſation in matter of conſanguinity or near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of kindred; which being obtained, the Bull ſeaſonably arriv'd the night before that Duke <hi>Vincenzo</hi> died, ſo that the marriage was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated, whilſt the Corps were yet warm; and the day following, the Bridegroom, together with his mourning aſſumed the Title of Prince of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and having in his power the Garriſon, and the Cittadel called <hi>Porto,</hi> required from the people an Oath of Fidelity in the name of his Father. <hi>Guaſtalla</hi> in the mean time publiſhed a Patent from the Emperour, empowering him to take poſſeſſion of <hi>Mantua,</hi> until the right ſhould be declared, and commanding the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> to maintain this Decree by force, if need ſhould require: <hi>Guaſtalla</hi> alſo had thoughts of going himſelf to <hi>Mantua,</hi> but the paſſage was already ſtop'd by the anticipations of <hi>Rhetel:</hi> wherefore he practiſed upon <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi> endeavouring to alienate the minds of that people from their new Prince; but all in vain, becauſe the name of <hi>Nevers,</hi> was univerſally cryed up both at <hi>Caſal,</hi> and in the Country of <hi>Montferrat.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:50681:367"/>The intereſt of Princes being now diſcovered, reaſon or juſtice were no longer debated in the cauſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but calculations made of Force, opportunity, and advantage. The Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to joyn with <hi>Nevers,</hi> as the ſafeſt intereſt in which to maintain the liberty of <hi>Italy:</hi> howſoever being willing to decline the aſſiſtance of <hi>France,</hi> and other Strangers, they deſigned a middle party compoſed of a League with the Pope, and other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> by which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it eaſie to protect the Juſtice of <hi>Nevers</hi> by Negotiation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves on all occaſions againſt violence. This Remonſtrance of the <hi>Venetians <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> approved, and offered his interpoſition with powerful Offices: <hi>But what,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>can be promiſed from Reaſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arms, in dealing with him who places Reaſon, and Juſtice in nothing but Arms? the exceſs of Power in Princes makes little account of the Pope's Prayers, and their Mediation is reduced to almoſt nothing elſe, but to adorn the Frontiſpiece of Treaties with his Name.</hi> The intentions of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> were in reality conformable to his expreſſions: for he deſired to maintain <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> in the ſucceſſion of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but abhorred to engage himſelf ſo far, as to be obliged to come to the extremity of taking up Arms. But whileſt theſe things were in meditation and diſcourſe between the Pope, and other the Friends of <hi>Rhetel</hi>; the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the diverſion, which the Arms of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. found againſt his Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>France,</hi> entered with his Army into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and hoped to be ſpeedily Maſter both of that Country, and of the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Caſal</hi> which was beſieged already by Marquis <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> Lieutenant General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces in <hi>Italy</hi>; as was <hi>Mantua</hi> alſo at the ſame time by the Forces of the Emperour. At length on the 18th. of <hi>July</hi> 1630. in the Night the City of <hi>Mantua</hi> was by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery taken by the <hi>Germans,</hi> and for the ſpace of three days committed to the pillage, and cruelty of the Soldiers, with all the outrages, which luſt, impiety, and licence could ſuggeſt to mercileſs Conquerours: the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> retired into a Monaſtery, where being reſpected for her Sex and Quality, ſhe obtained licence to be carried to the Empreſs, to whom ſhe was nearly related; the Duke retired haſtily into <hi>Porto,</hi> where the Ammunition for full accompliſhment of the Treaſon taking fire, he was forced to ſurrender on condition, that he ſhould be convoyed by two Companies of <hi>German</hi> Horſe into the Country of <hi>Ferrara</hi> to remain at <hi>Melara,</hi> where the Duke was ſupplied with Mony for his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from the <hi>Venetians.</hi> The taking of <hi>Mantua</hi> in this terrible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner increaſed the hopes of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who beſieged <hi>Caſal,</hi> that they ſhould ſpeedily become Maſters of that important place, but their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were diſappointed by the coming of the <hi>French</hi> Troops under the command of <hi>Mareſchal Schomberg</hi> ſent by <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. for relief of his Ally the Duke of <hi>Mantua; Thoiras</hi> who was Governour of <hi>Caſal</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the place with great gallantry, which gave ſuch diſcouragement to the Enemy, that upon approach of the <hi>French</hi> Troops the Siege was raiſed, and the Town conſerved to its lawful Maſter.

From this common diſtaſt of Princes, aroſe an other of a private na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, between the Cavalier <hi>Giovanni Peſari</hi> Ambaſſadour for the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Taddeo</hi> the Prefect; the occaſion was this: the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect caſually meeting in the ſtreet with <hi>Peſari,</hi> cauſed his Coach to ſtop; (as the cuſtom is always in <hi>Rome,</hi> that when the Coaches of Cardinals, Ambaſſadours and other Great Men meet, they always ſtop, and ſend Meſſages of Complement one to the other) but <hi>Peſari</hi> not obſerving it by reaſon that it was in the dusk of the Evening, drove on without no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Prefect; which though <hi>Peſari</hi> ſent afterwards expreſly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, yet the Prefect was ſo offended, that he purpoſely deſigned to meet him an other time; and that he might requite the late neglect, he corrupted the Ambaſſadours Coachman to ſtay his Horſes, feigning that his Hat was fallen off; and ſo in the mean time, the Prefect paſſed without notice of the Ambaſſadour. <hi>Peſari</hi> intended to have chaſtiſed his Servant for this piece of treachery, but that he was reſcued by ſome armed Men from the puniſhment he deſerved.</p>
               <p>The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> which is always talkative, and figuring a ſtrange kind of effects from ſuch ſhadows, and appearances made great account of theſe Formalities, diſcourſing of them with the ſame direful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, as Men in other parts uſe to conclude from bloudy Battels, and important Conqueſts. But the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> having notice hereof, was well aſſured, that by ſupport of the Uncle, the party of the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berins</hi> would be too ſtrong in <hi>Rome</hi>; ordered their Ambaſſadour <hi>Peſari,</hi> that for evidence of a publick Reſentment, he ſhould immediately leave the City without taking the leaſt notice either of the Pope, or his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews; and in the mean time at <hi>Venice</hi> the Nuntio was ſuſpended from Audience. To this diſguſt an other quarrel was annexed, occaſioned by a Bull made the laſt year by <hi>

The Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> which have always adhered to their antient Forms, and Stile, and will upon no occaſion whatſoever be induced to alter, and change their Cuſtoms, would never give other Title to them, than of <hi>Reverendiſſimo, &amp; Illuſtriſſimo,</hi> which gave great diſguſt, and mortification to the Pope, and ſerved to increaſe the former diſcontent. To theſe were added other ſharp conteſts between thoſe of <hi>Loreo,</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the <hi>Venetians</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where Cardinal <hi>Palotta</hi> the Pope's Legat, encroached on the undoubted confines of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and impriſoning the <hi>Venetian</hi> Subjects, ſhewed an intention to attempt greater Novelties; and by erecting, and changing the High<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ways, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the courſe of the Waters in ſuch manner, as made the River <hi>Po</hi> almoſt uſeleſs. The <hi>Venetians</hi> provoked by theſe miſchiefs, laboured to repair themſelves with like returns: for <hi>Luca Peſaro</hi> Captain of the Gulf, entring into the <hi>Sacca di Goro</hi> with ſome Gallies, and armed Barks, ſtopped the Ships, which with Victuals, and Merchandiſe paſſed by Sea towards <hi>Ferrara:</hi> He deſtroyed alſo the works, which were lately made in the River to divert its courſe. The Troops alſo encreaſed on both
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:50681:368"/>
ſides; and the Pope raiſed on his Confines a Fort called <hi>della Bocchette,</hi> to which the <hi>Venetians</hi> oppoſed another calling it <hi>della Donzella</hi>; ſo all things looked turbulent, as if they would have proceeded farther than words.</p>
               <p>But to give a ſtop to the heat of Arms the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and both the Pope, and the Republick giving their promiſe to King <hi>Lewis</hi> not to offend each other in a hoſtile manner, there remained a large field for Treaty. The Pope aſſured the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Briſac,</hi> that of what had hapned at <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Peſar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> he had had no information until afterwards, much leſs that his Nephew had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the reſcue of the Coachman, and was a ſtranger to both mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; expreſſing himſelf much diſcontented for what had hapned, and that for evidence hereof he had puniſhed the Offenders with baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That as to the Title given to Cardinals of <hi>Illuſtriſſimo</hi> by the Republick, he was well ſatisfied, nor did he require them to alter their Stile, for that the Republick having always been connumerated with crowned Heads, they were comprehended with Kings in exception of the Title of <hi>Eminence,</hi> and ſo commanded the Cardinals to receive Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the State of <hi>Venice</hi> in the uſual Form; with which the Senate being ſatisfied, admitted the Nuntio to Audience.</p>
               <p>But the Diſpute about the Confines being of more Antient date, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of greater difficulties: For the Pope came to lay claim to certain Lands which the <hi>Po,</hi> and the Sea had left, called <hi>Alluvioni:</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſeemed of no great value; but the Parties, eſpecially the <hi>Venetians</hi> judged it of great importance, becauſe it carried with it the rights, and juriſdiction of the Sea. The buſineſs at laſt was brought into <hi>Venice</hi> by the mediation of the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, and the Treaty continued part of the year following; at length the <hi>Venetians</hi> declaring themſelves ready to accept any Conditions, which were conſiſtent with the juriſdiction of the Sea, to which alſo the mouths of Rivers and the <hi>Sacca di Goro</hi> did appertain, preſerved the antient Covenants with thoſe of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and the Power to divert the prejudices of Ports, and Channels, which are the Veins, and life of the Capital City. Yet ſtill the differences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and though they broke not forth into acts of violence, and War, yet the Diſpute was not determined.</p>
               <p>In the year 1633. one <hi>Centini</hi> a Cardinals Nephew, hoping that if <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> were dead, his Uncle would be choſen into his place, contrived the Pope's death by Witchcraft, and Negromancy; for having faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Pope's Image in Wax, he wounded it with Pins and Needles, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the antient manner of Witchcraft, <hi>In jecur urget acus,</hi> but the Villany being diſcovered, <hi>Centini</hi> and a Frier his aſſociate, were puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their demerit.</p>
               <p>But we muſt not omit to mention, in the great Hall of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where the Embaſſies of Kings, (termed the Embaſſies of Obedience) are received by the Pope; there is that famous Picture, repreſenting the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Alexander</hi> III. and under it was written an Elogy in honour of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Commonwealth, by whoſe aſſiſtance the Pope prevailed over the Emperour <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa</hi>; which Elogy, this Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> cauſed to be blotted out, and defaced. <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was amazed at ſuch a Novelty, becauſe the Inſcriptions, by which the Picture in the Hall of the moſt memorable Actions of Chriſtendom were explained, had been
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:50681:369"/>
choſen and ſelected in the time of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. and had been appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by a Conſultation of Cardinals, and other learned Perſons, and that in particular had been extracted out of the moſt Antient proofs, the conſent of Authors, Inſcriptions, Pictures, Marbles, and out of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick, and infinite Memorials: and though in theſe later times Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> (who would juſtifie the Pope, and the Church in all things, which either they would ſay, or act) hath called the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in queſtion, yet the credit of the Hiſtory remains, and the praiſe of that Republick never to be forgotten. Now in regard this Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> had defaced, and blotted out the <hi>Elogium,</hi> he ſeemed to deny the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, and ſuppreſs the fame of that Victory which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had gained, and deprive them of that merit, and gratitude which was owing to them from the Church, aboliſhing out of the World the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, and as much as he was able, cancelling the glory of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, to which his Predeceſſours had not diſdained to confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged. The advice hereof greatly diſturbed matters at <hi>Venice,</hi> and gave an interruption to the Negotiation about the Confines which in the year 1635.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1635.</note> was again reaſſumed by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de la Thuillerie</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> and by <hi>Nani,</hi> and <hi>Soranzo</hi> deputed by the Senate; the Treaty was far advanced, it being agreed to draw a line, which ſhould terminate the Land; ſo that there remained no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty concerning the change which the <hi>Po</hi> ſhould make in its Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, for that if the <hi>Po</hi> ſhould change its courſe and paſs the line to the <hi>Donzella,</hi> then it ſhould be eſteemed to belong to the Eccleſiaſtical State, but if contrariwiſe, it ſhould paſs to the <hi>Goro,</hi> then it ſhould belong to the <hi>Venetians:</hi> but this, and all other Negotiations were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off by defacing the <hi>Elogium,</hi> which was ſo hainouſly reſented at <hi>Venice,</hi> that the Senate immediately commanded their Ambaſſadour <hi>Roſſi</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> with Orders neither to take leave of the Pope, nor of his Nephews, nor Cardinals, and that Audience alſo ſhould be denied to the Pope's Nuntio at <hi>Venice:</hi> for all confeſſed, that the Republick could no more ſend Ambaſſadours to venerate in that Hall (as was cuſtomary) the Vicars of Chriſt, ſo long as their Illuſtrious Memorials were ſuſpended, if not condemned: wherefore the Republick would maintain no other Miniſter at <hi>Rome,</hi> than onely <hi>Girolamo Bono,</hi> with Title of <hi>Secretary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe matters were acting in <hi>Italy,</hi> all other Countries of Chriſtendom were for the moſt part engaged in War; for compoſing of which, and in performing acts of mediation tending to Peace, the Pope was engaged; until towards the year 1640. the War, and troubles came nearer home, cauſed by Conteſts, and reſentments between him and <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> the beginning, and end whereof we ſhall here relate.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> being much impaired with age, and weakened in the vigour of his Authority, and Power, the <hi>Barberins</hi> his Nephews, took upon them to manage all matters with an exceſs of Arbitrary Command: He that poſſeſſed moſt of the Pope's favour, and affection was Cardinal <hi>Franciſco,</hi> who was deep in his Deſigns, conceited of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and eager and violent in the proſecution of what he affected. On the other ſide, <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was of a high and active Spirit, apt to reſentments, but yet being adorned with Arts both Civil and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:50681:369"/>
Military, might have been eſteemed a moſt admirable Prince, had either fortune given him an Empire and Power equal to his mind, or prudence equalled his mind to his power and fortune. Many ſecret piques, and diſguſts had for ſome time paſſed between him and the <hi>Barberins,</hi> which were concealed, and covered; until at length in the year 1639. Duke <hi>Edward</hi> going to <hi>Rome,</hi> the antient diſcontents brake forth more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for in the firſt place the Duke thought he was not treated with that Ceremony, and reſpect which was due to his condition and quality; then that his Brother Prince <hi>Franciſco Maria</hi> was not created Cardinal, as was promiſed: but what was moſt important of all, was the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of many favours, and conceſſions expected from the Pope; and particularly an abatement of half <hi>per cent.</hi> on the revenue which the Duke paid to <hi>Monti,</hi> which is an Annual rent antiently aſſigned by the <hi>Farneſi</hi> Dukes of <hi>Parma</hi> upon the revenues of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> a Dukedom they held in <hi>Fief</hi> of the Church: for though the Pope had made this Grant, and had not recalled it, yet is was croſſed by the Nephews, and with ſundry delays, difficulties, and excuſes prolonged and diminiſhed. The Duke reſenting theſe neglects, and unkindneſſes, departed angrily from <hi>Rome,</hi> without taking leave either of the Pope or Nephews, inveighing violently againſt Cardinal <hi>Franciſco,</hi> and his Government. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal to requite the Duke, perſuaded the Pope to recal the Grant he had given for exportation of Corn out of the Eccleſiaſtical State into the Country of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> by which the people were not onely ready to be famiſhed, but the beſt revenues of <hi>Caſtro</hi> ceaſed; for the Duke having farmed the Exportation of Corn to certain Merchants for ninety ſeven thouſand Crowns <hi>per annum</hi>; the Exportation being forbidden, the Merchants renounced the agreement: whereupon the ſum failing to pay the <hi>Montiſts,</hi> they complained to the Courts of Juſtice, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Duke being a Vaſſal, and ſubject to the Church ſhould be juridically cited. The Duke imputed all to the malice and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Barberins</hi> to deſpoil him of his Country, and believing that he ſhould be overborn by his Enemies, who were both Judges and Parties, reſolved to fortifie himſelf againſt force, and accordingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched a Gentleman of <hi>Montferrat</hi> to be Governour with a Garriſon to <hi>Caſtro,</hi> cauſing Half-moons, and Redoubts to be caſt up about the place. This being judged a Crime by the <hi>Barberins,</hi> and a rebellion againſt his Sovereign, a Monitory was publiſhed by the Auditor of the Chamber, limiting unto the Duke thirty days to demoliſh the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> and disband the Garriſon, and otherwiſe declared him to have incurred Rebellion, and Excommunication.</p>
               <p>The quarrel being thus begun, the <hi>Barbarins</hi> raiſed ſix thouſand Foot and five hundred Horſe with all ſpeed under the command of <hi>Taddeo,</hi> the Prefect of <hi>Rome,</hi> appointing their Rendezvouz at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> where they fortified their Camp with a train of Artillery, and provided it with all ſorts of Victuals, and Ammunition. Theſe preparations adminiſtred occaſions of various Diſcourſe, and reflections to the people, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the blame of all to the pride, and ambition of the Nephews; for the World would not be induced to believe, that the Pope, who, when he was young cultivated peace in all parts, and was naturally of a quiet Spirit, muſt needs be affected with ſtrange thoughts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, if now in the extremity of his age, he ſhould be perſuaded to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:50681:370"/>
it; and ſo much the more in a conjuncture, when all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was torn in pieces with War and Diſſenſion, and ſtood rather in need of his paternal mediation to produce Concord amongſt Princes, than to ſee him the Author and contriver of War in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> ſeemed above all jealous of the event of this War, believing that the <hi>Barberins</hi> had engaged the <hi>French</hi> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> was alſo diſpleaſed to ſee the Pope armed on his Confines with intention to make new Conqueſts. Wherefore both the Viceroy and the Grand Duke interpoſed in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of mediation; to which the Pope making ſome ſhort replies, that his reſolution was onely to humble his Vaſſal, and make himſelf obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, gave no place or opportunity for Treaty.</p>
               <p>The Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> kept themſelves ſilent for a while, which the <hi>Barberins</hi> interpreted, (as indeed it was) an effect of their diſcontent, rather than a token of their ſatisfaction: but being at length ſollicited much by the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to intereſs themſelves in the quarrel, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter various Debates, it was reſolved with general conſent, to intreat the Pope, that he would yield to the inſtances and common ſatisfaction of the Princes, who with unanimous deſires interpoſed themſelves for the Peace, by giving time and expedients for a Treaty. To the Duke they gave Counſel of moderation, and to humble himſelf in ſuch decent ſort to the Pope, as might pacifie him, and bring him honourably off from his Engagements and Enterpriſe. But in the mean time the <hi>Barberins,</hi> that they might prevent the importunities of Princes, haſtned their march towards <hi>Caſtro,</hi> upon an Opinion, that having once taken the place, the fervour, with which the Mediators interpoſed for a Peace, would be abated, and matters reduced to ſuch intricacies, as that in the end the glory of the Counſels, and the merit of the Enterpriſe would fall out to their advantage. Howſoever, to make the matter more plauſible, another Bull was publiſhed in which the time preſcribed to Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was prolonged for fifteen days; and yet at the ſame time on the 27th. of <hi>September</hi> 1641.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1641.</note> the Pope's Army entered the the territories of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> and appearing before <hi>Rocca Montalto</hi> which is towards the Sea, the Guard conſiſting of fifty Soldiers abandoned the place; and ſoon after <hi>Caſtro</hi> it ſelf ſurrendered, upon conditions of life, and enjoyment of goods to the Soldiers and Inhabitants; and ſo the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon being two hundred and fifty in number marched forth, on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day after the Siege was laid: which news much troubled the Duke, coming to him juſt at the time that he in perſon, and Count <hi>Palmia</hi> by permiſſion of the Grand Duke, was conducting Forces, through <hi>Tuſcany</hi> for relief of the place.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Edward</hi> being thus foiled, made new applications to the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> fearing leſt he ſhould be attacqued in his Dominions of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza:</hi> and in the mean time to keep himſelf from thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, which in the way of Judicature, the Acts which had paſt might bring upon him, he cauſed a Proteſt to be preſented to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor <hi>della Camera,</hi> wherein he declared, that the <hi>Barberins</hi> being his Enemies, he had no other Judg left him, but Force, nor hope of favour, but from his Friends.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Barberins</hi> being flattered by all upon theſe ſucceſſes, and elated with vanity and pride, denied to give admittance to any Treaty; the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:50681:370"/>
Pope ſeemed to hear with trouble the Offices brought to him by Order of the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> ſcorning to admit Mediators betwixt Sovereign, and Vaſſal.</p>
               <p>Nor were the <hi>French</hi> either ſilent, or unactive upon this occaſion; but laying hold on this turbulent conjuncture of Affairs, proffered the Pope the powerful Forces of their Crown to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Italy</hi>; and raiſing his thoughts to a more noble Deſign, than that of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> proffered to leave the diſpoſal of the Conqueſts to his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the Crown of <hi>Naples</hi> to his Nephews.</p>
               <p>But <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> looking on theſe Propoſitions, as more ſpecious than eaſie, abſolutely refuſed them; and in deſpight of all the applications and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes made by ſeveral Princes in favour of <hi>Parma,</hi> the Duke was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to have incurred the greater Excommunication, and in vertue thereof to be deprived of his Dominions, and <hi>Fiefs,</hi> and of the Dignity he held of the Holy Sea, and condemned in all charges, done, or to be done: in purſuance of which Sentence, his Palaces, and Goods in <hi>Rome</hi> were expoſed to ſale, and <hi>Caſtro</hi> taken into the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Camera,</hi> though not annexed to the Popedom by vertue of the rigorous Bull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> which forbids all alienations of Lands, or Goods, which were once united to the Papal Chair.</p>
               <p>The Princes were highly moved, to find all their interceſſions, and inſtances ſo little eſteemed by the <hi>Barberins</hi>; and much more alarm'd when they underſtood, that the Pope demanded paſſage for his Army through the Dominions of <hi>Modena,</hi> againſt <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> which being places unprovided for War,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1642.</note> and the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> not having force to reſiſt the powerful Army of the Pope conſiſting of eighteen or nineteen thouſand Men, conſented to grant a paſſage; provided, <hi>That there ſhould be ſix days before the Army moved, and that in other four it ſhould have paſſed his Confines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the Grand Duke, who were averſe to Arms, and not inclined to uſe them, but as their laſt remedy: yet not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that the Duke ſhould periſh, or the <hi>Barberins</hi> be accuſtomed to the happy iſſue of their Counſels, ſent a ſupply of ſeventy thouſand Crowns to <hi>Parma,</hi> which gave courage to the Soldiery and credit to the cauſe amongſt the Subjects, who thence conceived ſome hopes of greater ſuccours.</p>
               <p>In the mean time all the Offices, and warm inſtances imaginable of mediation, were employed at <hi>Rome</hi> by the Miniſters of <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> which produced nothing but uncertain, and ambiguous anſwers, and to the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> it was plainly declared, that a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Arms ſhould be granted, when promiſes, and aſſurances ſhould be given by the Duke's Friends, that he ſhould teſtifie due reſpect, and obedience to the Eccleſiaſtical State; and that no words, or inſtances ſhould be made for the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> which by reaſon of the Debt to the <hi>Montiſts</hi> and the charge of the War, was already forfeited to the <hi>Camera,</hi> and condemned thereby.</p>
               <p>But ſuch Anſwers as theſe not ſatisfying the Princes; the <hi>Venetians</hi> reſolved to ſend three thouſand Foot and three hundred Horſe, to joyn with two thouſand Men ſent by the Grand Duke, to oppoſe the march of the Pope's Army into the State of <hi>Parma.</hi> The news of theſe Forces, and their march, and the rumour of Treaties, and Leagues forming
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:50681:371"/>
in favour of <hi>Parma</hi> greatly perplexed the <hi>Barberins</hi>; becauſe that their Army, which was compoſed of new Men, and which expected to enter the Country of <hi>Parma</hi>; as to an eaſie, and ſecure Triumph, was ſo terrified with the noiſe of an Enemy, marching to oppoſe them that they ran away in full Troops, ſo that their numbers were very much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed in a ſhort time.</p>

But Duke <hi>Edward</hi> entering reſolutely into the <hi>Bologneſe,</hi> ſtrook ſuch terrour into the people, and the Army of the Pope, that all was in a moment ſeen in confuſion, and diſorder: for the Prefect retired flying into <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the Soldiers quit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted their Quarters, the Authority, threats, or intreaties of the Officers prevailing nothing againſt their cowardiſe, and fears. Thus without bloud, and without a Battel <hi>Edward</hi> prevailed, and became Maſter of the Field, which is a paſſage the more memorable, becauſe that in an Enemies Country, nothing could have been more done by an Army ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo powerful. For <hi>Bologna</hi> it ſelf a great and populous City ſent Letters to him full of reſpect; the Governour of <hi>Smola</hi> ſent the Keyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Town to meet him. <hi>Faenza</hi> opened its Gates, and the Governour deſcended from the Walls to meet, and pacifie him. <hi>Furli</hi> ſeemed as if it would make ſome reſiſtance; but ſoon ſurrendred at diſcretion; where he lodged only for one whole day to refreſh his Soldiers wearied with their march, and incommoded with the Rains.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe ſucceſſes, the fear, and terrour which poſſeſſed the minds of the people at <hi>Rome,</hi> is not to be expreſſed; for that City being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a cowardly ſort of Inhabitants, ſuch as Prieſts who are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to danger, and Strangers who are pleaſed with Reports, and Novelties, ſeemed diſtracted by various affectations: for ſome feared plunder, others deſired diſorder, and all reproached the Government. During theſe troubles, and diſtractions, Guards were placed in the ſtreets, and the command of them given to ſeveral Prelates, Soldiers were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied in all places, and the Coach-Horſes in <hi>Rome</hi> ſeiſed to mount the Soldiers. The Prefect alſo was recalled to Court, and great murmurings againſt him for having ſhewn as much baſeneſs in danger as he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Avarice in the Government: in his place Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> was ſent, but Cardinal <hi>Franciſco</hi> attended to the Arts of Negotiation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with hopes of Peace to amuſe the Duke, and fruſtrate the League.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> made his head quarters at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> whileſt the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was at <hi>Aqua Pendente:</hi> and the Cardinal having put conſiderable Garriſons into the Towns, advanced with ſeven thouſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe to <hi>Montefiaſcone,</hi> intending to ſtreighten
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:50681:371"/>
the Duke in his quarters, and obſtruct his paſſage into the State of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro:</hi> But the Duke mounting on Horſeback, and making a ſhew as if he would advance towards him, though much inferiour to the Enemy in force; yet the Cardinal retired, and would not ſtand the ſhock, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rather to overcome with Prudence, than run the hazard of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. So that now the month of <hi>October</hi> being come, and the Rains having fallen in great abundance, the approach of the Winter ſeemed a ſeaſon more proper for Treaty than for War. In the management of which Cardinal <hi>Barberino</hi> laying more ſtreſs on tricks, and deluſions, than on the ſubſtantial points of ſolid Reaſon in Treaties, diſpatched the Abbat <hi>de Bagni</hi> to the Great Duke at <hi>Florence</hi> with Propoſals. That abſolution of the Cenſures ſhould be given to <hi>Edward</hi> with the forms contained in the Ceremonial. The inveſtiture of his Dominions ſhould be given to his eldeſt Son, with reſtitution of all that was paſt, except <hi>Caſtro</hi> and <hi>Montalto,</hi> with ſo much of the Country round about as was within Cannon ſhot.</p>
               <p>Theſe Propoſitions being tranſmitted from the Great Duke to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> were by common conſent rejected,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1643.</note> ſeeming unreaſonable to be offered to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and diſhonourable to the League; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Treaties at <hi>Venice</hi> were more cloſely confirmed between <hi>Gondi</hi> the Great Duke's Secretary, the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> and the Senate, being reſolved not to abandom their firſt intentions of protecting the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi> But amidſt theſe Negotiations Duke <hi>Edward</hi> moved by the fury, and impatience of his diſpoſition, diſpeeded three thouſand Foot to croſs the <hi>Appenines,</hi> with deſign to embark them on ſome <hi>Tartanes,</hi> and other Veſſels, which were laid ready to receive them at that place, where the River <hi>Magra</hi> falls into the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea; that ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing the Rock of <hi>Montalto</hi> they might eaſily make themſelves Maſters alſo of the City of <hi>Caſtro:</hi> but not only the Snows on the Mountains hindred the paſſage of the Soldiers ſo long, that the deſign was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at <hi>Rome,</hi> and proviſions made againſt it: but alſo the Soldiers being embarked were encountred with ſuch a ſtorm of contrary Winds as drove them to <hi>Genoua,</hi> and <hi>Porto fino,</hi> where being unprovided of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and Mony, part of them periſhed, and the remainder was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into pay by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, who ſeaſonably ſent them to ſtrengthen the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who beſieged <hi>Fortona.</hi> Duke <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> angred with this ill ſucceſs, deſigned to enter the Country of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> which beyond the <hi>Po</hi> confines with the Republick; but being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed herein, he demanded paſſage through <hi>Tuſcany</hi> to go with one thouſand five hundred Horſe, and a few Foot for recovery of <hi>Caſtro:</hi> but the Great Duke denied it, until matters were agreed, and better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on more ſolid, and more probable grounds at <hi>Venice</hi>; becauſe that he going forth with weak Forces, and often foiled, his unhappy ſucceſs diminiſhed the vigour, and reputation of the Arms of the Confederates equally with his own.</p>
               <p>Thus the minds of Men being on all ſides irritated, the War proceeded: and the hot Spirit of Duke <hi>Edward</hi> not being capable of reſtraint, he with ſix weak Regiments of Foot, and as many of Horſe, compoſed of ſeveral Nations, and one of Dragoons entered the Country of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and came to <hi>Bondeno,</hi> defended by <hi>Mauriconi</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan</hi> with five hundred Foot, and four hundred Horſe; but he no ſooner heard a Volley of the Duke's
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:50681:372"/>
Men, which in the duskineſs of the Evening approached his Fort, but he immediately abandoned his Poſt, and ran away to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where he was followed by his Garriſon: then the Duke attaqued <hi>la Stella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> which making ſome ſmall reſiſtance, afterwards ſurrendred. But Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> that he might hinder the Duke's farther progreſs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped at <hi>Oſteria Nuova,</hi> a convenient place between <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna.</hi> Wherefore the Confederates haſtned the reſult of all their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, thinking they had no time to loſe, but to cloſe with this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, before the people were delivered from their preſent fears, or that Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> ſhould have defeated, or made the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to retire. Wherefore it was agreed:
<q>That their Forces ſhould be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to eighteen thouſand Foot, and two thouſand ſix hundred Horſe: Theſe were to be divided into two Bodies, one in <hi>Toſcany,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Dominions of <hi>Modena,</hi> and in both, the colours of the League were to be diſplayed: What was taken was to be held in the name of all, until the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was reſtored to his own Dominions. It was alſo farther agreed, That the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould ſeize the Banks of the <hi>Po,</hi> and when there was occaſion of taking the Field, the Troops in <hi>Modena</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Parma,</hi> if they could joyn, ſhould at the ſame time ſecond the Enterpriſe. From <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> the Nuntios were to be diſcharged, and the Revenues of the <hi>Barberins</hi> were to be ſequeſtred.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And now ſeveral feats of Arms paſſed with various ſucceſſes: for Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> had removed his Camp to <hi>Cento,</hi> where he ſo well fortified himſelf, that he equally defended the territories of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and <hi>Bologna:</hi> The Confederates to make ſome advance deſired to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodg him; but the Cardinal being better fortified than was imagined, gave ſome demur unto their Counſels in what manner to act. But in the mean time the <hi>Venetians</hi> employed part of their Forces at Sea, infeſting the Coaſt with ſix Gallies, and ſome armed Barks even to the City of <hi>Ancona</hi>; they took alſo the Tower of <hi>Premiero,</hi> which being recovered afterwards by the Eccleſiaſticks was demoliſhed: the Prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor <hi>Delfino</hi> ſurpriſed alſo in the Night that ſmall Fort, called <hi>delle Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chette,</hi> which the Pope, (as we have ſaid) had lately built. The Towers likewiſe of <hi>del Abbate,</hi> and <hi>di Goro</hi> were rendered; as was <hi>Arriano</hi> a great Town, which in a fear drove out their Garriſon, and yielded to <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fino.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> on the other ſide intending to carry the War into <hi>Modena,</hi> took in <hi>Spilimberto, Vignivola,</hi> and St. <hi>Ceſario</hi> open places of the Ftontier: but the Duke, with the Proveditor <hi>Corraro</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with all their Army, deſirous to draw him to a Battel: and to provoke him thereunto they reſolved to inveſt <hi>Crevalcuore</hi> (a good Town in the Country of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> but not ſtrong) in the view, and ſight of the Cardinal: but this Exploit being put into execution with one thouſand Foot and four hundred Horſe, only the Cardinal oppoſing them with a great Force, conſtrained them to retire in diſorder, leaving one of their Cannon ſticking in the mire.</p>
               <p>The Great Duke of <hi>Toſcany</hi> in the mean time coming in perſon as far as St. <hi>Caſciano,</hi> had put the Army into the Field under the command of Prince <hi>Mathias,</hi> but with direction of <hi>Alexander del Borro</hi> a valiant and experienced Soldier: Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> ſent a Body of five or ſix thouſand Men againſt them commanded by the Duke of <hi>Savelli</hi>; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:50681:372"/>
which the <hi>Florentines</hi> advanced into the Eccleſiaſtical State, and having taken the ſtrong Paſs of <hi>Buterone,</hi> attacked the City <hi>della Pieve,</hi> where a Garriſon of one thouſand five hundred Men without force of Cannon, ſoon capitulated and ſurrendered on conditions, that they might march forth with their Swords only; From thence <hi>Borri</hi> with two thouſand Foot, and eight hundred Horſe made an Incurſion as far as <hi>Orvieto,</hi> forcing <hi>Savelli</hi> to retire farther into the Country.</p>
               <p>Howſoever not long after, the Cardinal ſent <hi>Valanze</hi> to enter <hi>Toſcany</hi> with three thouſand Foot, and one thouſand Horſe; which he did with ſuch expedition that he attacked <hi>Piſtoia</hi> before the Great Duke could ſupply it with ſuch ſuccours as it required, yet the courage of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and Soldiers was ſuch, that they repulſed the Enemy, and preſerved their City: Howſoever the news hereof ſtrook a terrour into the hearts of the people of <hi>Florence,</hi> who for a long time had not been accuſtomed to ſo near an approach of the Enemy: but the news of the ſucceſs ſoon quieted their minds; and the Great Duke to ſhew a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his people, put Arms into their hands, which had not been accuſtomary for many years paſt.</p>
               <p>Thus did matters paſs with various ſucceſſes, but moſt commonly in favour of the Confederates, until the ſeaſon proper for action ended; when the Winter approaching, the Treaties interrupted by the War, were again reaſſumed: And indeed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> diſcovered not only an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but a deſire of Peace; for being burthened with years, and weary of the cares which War carries with it, was deſirous to end his days in calmneſs, and quiet: and though his Nephews endeavoured to diſguiſe matters which were the moſt tragical, and ſad, yet the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the people, which had ſuffered under the devaſtations, and preſſures of War had come to his Ears: wherefore he conſented to a Treaty with the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> entreating the Cardinal <hi>Bichi,</hi> who was ſent by the Court of <hi>France</hi> for the Office of Mediation, to haſten the Peace, that the ſhort reſidue of his life might terminate in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The Congregation of State erected purpoſely for direction of the Military Affairs concurred in their deſires with the Pope, to which Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Barberin,</hi> though much againſt his will, was forced to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, knowing that with the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro</hi> a diſhonourable Peace was to be the conſequence of an unhappy War. With theſe diſpoſitions towards a Peace, Cardinal <hi>Bichi</hi> departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> and in his way to <hi>Venice</hi> paſſed through <hi>Florence,</hi> where in Diſcourſe he underſtood from the Great Duke, that ſaving his own Rights, and Intereſts the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates would be ſatisfied with the full reſtoration of the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi> The Cardinal being arrived at <hi>Venice</hi> was followed by the Dukes of <hi>Modena,</hi> and <hi>Parma; Gondi,</hi> and <hi>Teſti</hi> were already there, debating with <hi>Nani,</hi> and <hi>Guſſoni,</hi> whom the Senate had deputed for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>It was now the beginning of the year 1644.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1644.</note> when the Cardinal <hi>Bichi</hi> propoſed, That Abſolution and Pardon ſhould be demanded by <hi>France</hi> for Duke <hi>Edward,</hi> and that <hi>Caſtro</hi> ſhould be reſtored to him, and that the rights of the <hi>Montiſts</hi> ſhould remain, as before: and that the Confederates ſhould reſtore that which they poſſeſſed belonging to the Church: And to take off the diffidence which the Confederates conceived of non-performance of Articles by the <hi>Barberins</hi> he propoſed the word of <hi>France</hi> for <hi>Guarantie,</hi> upon declaration and promiſe, that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:50681:373"/>
their Arms ſhould be employed againſt him, that ſhould fail in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Agreement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> falling extreamly ſick, whilſt matters were in Treaty, <hi>Bichi</hi> haſtned the concluſion, conſidering, that his death would cauſe great alteration in the Treaty: and as a preparation thereunto propoſed a ceſſation of Arms; to which the Confederates aſſented, being ſenſible that ſuch an accident could not happen without great revolutions in the Dominions of the Church; and that with the death of the Pope, the Authority of the Nephews ceaſing, thoſe motives would vaniſh, which had been the Original and cauſe of the War: but the Pope's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery altered all thoſe Counſels which were contrived in caſe of his death; and induced them to haſten a concluſion of the Peace. The Articles therefore propoſed by the Cardinal being debated in ſeveral Aſſemblies, were at laſt concluded, and agreed; and ſubſcribed at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> by Cardinal <hi>Bichi</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Giovanni Nani</hi> for <hi>Venice,</hi> by <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta Gondi</hi> for the Great Duke, and by the Marquis <hi>Faſſoni</hi> for <hi>Modena</hi>: and though the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> refuſed to ſubſcribe upon certain diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties he made; yet being over-ruled by the Confederates he was forced to concur. The Cardinal with this Agreement poſted in all haſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> being entertained in all places of the Eccleſiaſtical State, with the Acclamations, and Prayers of the People longing for Peace.</p>
               <p>The Articles ſubſcribed by the Confederates began with a Preamble, and Declaration;
<q>That they had entered into this War with no other Deſign than for the reſtoration of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> reſerving in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters their moſt conſtant Obedience to the Pope, and the Holy See: That all acts of Hoſtility be ſuſpended, and that the Confederate Princes withdraw their Forces into their own Dominions. That all Fortifications raiſed during this preſent War ſhall be demoliſhed on one ſide and the other. To the Perſons and Places which had ſerved, or rendred themſelves to any other Party, Pardon was granted: Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were ſet at liberty, the Religious Perſons who had withdrawn themſelves were permitted to return, and the Sequeſtration was taken off from the Rents of the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> and all Rights were clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſerved to the Parties as aforeſaid. For execution of all which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages were given to the <hi>French</hi> King, and the King for ſatisfaction of both Parties, declared, that he having become <hi>Guarantie</hi> for the Peace, his Arms ſhould be employed againſt thoſe, who obſerved not the Articles, and in favour of thoſe, who executed the Accord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Caſtro</hi> was rendered, and the Accord on all ſides executed, and Peace enſued to the ſatisfaction of the Pope, and quiet of <hi>Italy</hi>; but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> did not long enjoy the happineſs of this Peace; for being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the ſeventy ſeventh year of his age, he died on the 29th. of <hi>July</hi> in the year 1644. having reigned twenty one years, wanting eight days. He was certainly a Perſon of high prudence, generoſity, and fit for Buſineſs; in his youth he was eſteemed a great Poet; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well verſed in all the Books of Antient Poeſie. He was very munificent in his publick Buildings: and in his own private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments he was no leſs ſplendid, having in his life-time erected a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Monument for himſelf in a corner of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church near the Sepulchre of <hi>Paul</hi> III. and adorned it with pillars of Marbles according to the contrivance, and direction of Cavalier <hi>Bernini,</hi> with this Inſcription.

After mature conſideration of this Point, the whole Congregation of Cardinals (excepting ſome few) agreed, that it was not fit to remove <hi>Taddeo</hi> either from one, or the other Office; but in regard the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, who were cloſe Adherers to the Houſe of <hi>Medicis,</hi> were of Opinion, that ſome ſatisfaction ought to be given to the Grand Duke herein, it was concluded, and agreed; That the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Colledg of Cardinals ſhould by a Writing ſubſcribed with their own hands, give Security, and Aſſurance to Cardinal <hi>de Medecis</hi> that nothing ſhould be attempted in <hi>Rome</hi> againſt his Perſon.

                  <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuncio vobis gaudium magnum, habemus Papam Eminentiſſimum, &amp; Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendiſſimum Joannem Baptiſtam Pamphilium, qui ſibi nomen impoſuit In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius Decimus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 4th. of <hi>October</hi> Cardinal <hi>de Medicis</hi> ſet the tripple Crown on his Head, with great applauſe, and acclamations of the People: for though this Cardinal had excuſed himſelf from carrying the Croſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him after his Election, as his Office of Arch-Deacon did require, upon imagnations perhaps, that the Pope would become a favourer of the <hi>Barberins</hi> his mortal Enemies; as his gratitude to that Family might require: yet having in that Interval of time which was between his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and Coronation diſcovered, that his inclinations were otherwiſe diſpoſed (as we ſhall hereafter make appear) he then altered his Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the Pope, and became willing to plant the Crown upon his head. On this occaſion ſome Medals were ſtamped with the Image of our Lady with this Inſcription, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde venit Auxilium mihi.</hi> But his own Motto was: <hi>Da Servo Tuo Cor Docile, ut Populum Tuum judicare poſſit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now all the Ceremonies of his Inauguration being paſt, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to apply his mind to the Government of Church and State; and in the firſt place he ordained a Congregation to inſpect and ſtate the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the Church, and contrive ſome ways, and means for payment of Debts: and then according to the cuſtom of former Popes, he provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a cheap year, and to make Bread, and other Victuals plentiful in the City; than which nothing can be more acceptable to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> who always labour under the ſcarcity of Bread, unleſs ſupplied from <hi>Sicily,</hi> or other parts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Barberins</hi> did now believe, that this Pope being ſenſible of the many Obligations he had to their Uncle <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. whoſe Creature he had been; and to themſelves for his advancement to the Papal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, would have protected and defended the greatneſs, and Riches they had gained during the long Pontificate of <hi>

               <p>For ſo it fared with the <hi>Barberins:</hi> For whileſt matters were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Coronation of the Pope, the Ambaſſadours from Chriſtian Kings demanded the place of precedency at that Ceremony before <hi>Tad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo Barberini</hi> Prefect of <hi>Rome</hi>; for though in the time of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> that place was granted to him in quality of a Prince, for the relation he had to the Pope his Uncle; which now expiring, the ſole Office of Prefect could not entitle him to a precedency before Ambaſſadours. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of St. <hi>Chamont</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> appeared moſt vigorouſly againſt the Prefect, and was ſeconded by the Emperour's and the King
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:50681:375"/>
of <hi>Spains</hi> Ambaſſadours, who by ſeveral memorials given to the Pope, did proteſt that they would be preſent at the Solemnity of the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and poſſeſs their due rank and place which belonged to them; and if his Holineſs ſhould think fit to reſtrain them by force from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their attendance there, they would counſel their Maſters to recal them, and never ſend others to perform the Embaſſies of Obedience. For anſwer hereunto the Pope made no great matter of heſitation, or doubt, but immediately determined in favour of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</p>
               <p>Though this indifference, and coldneſs of the Pope to the <hi>Barberins</hi> was a great mortification to them; yet they were more ſenſibly touched, ſo ſoon as Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> was informed by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, how ill his matter was ſatisfied with the late actions of his Family; in reſentment of which, he had Orders to require from him the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which conſtituted him Protectour of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to take down the Arms of <hi>France</hi> from the Portal of his Gate; declaring that his unfaithfulneſs to his Majeſty was the cauſe of his diſpleaſure, for that in the late <hi>Conclave</hi> he had been an active Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the promotion of <hi>Pamfilio</hi> to the Papal Dignity, whom he knew to be an Enemy to him, and entirely dedicated to the intereſt of <hi>Spain.</hi> The two Cardinals <hi>Barberins</hi> finding themſelves thus abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>France,</hi> made their ſupplications to the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Spain</hi> for protection; but here alſo they found their way obſtructed by the Cardinal <hi>de Medicis,</hi> who gave the Cardinal <hi>Albornos,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour to underſtand, that both he, and his Nephew the Grand Duke ſhould be forced to abandon the Intereſt, and Service of <hi>Spain,</hi> in caſe they ſhould think fit to eſpouſe the quarrel of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> and receive them into the protection of the Catholick King. And thus being forſaken by theſe two powerful Crowns, they were deſirous to caſt themſelves into the Arms of the Pope, as their laſt refuge and Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: to gain which, they propoſed a Marriage between the Daughter of the Prefect, and <hi>Don Camillo</hi> the Son of <hi>Donna Olympia</hi>; offering to give her in Dowry all the Lands of <hi>Montelibreto,</hi> which they had purchaſed from the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> for a million of Livers, together with a Revenue of thirty thouſand Crowns of yearly Penſion to be raiſed out of the Benefices which they held from the Church, beſides ſuch a ſum of ready Money as his Holineſs ſhould reaſonably require. And though <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> was well enough pleaſed with theſe Propoſitions, yet the Project was croſſed by the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, who having repreſented unto the Pope the ill ſatisfaction his Maſter would receive from this Alliance, quite broke off the Match; the Pope declaring, that he had too much conſideration for his Majeſty to be overborn by any Intereſt which might be diſpleaſing, or inconſiſtent with that of <hi>France:</hi> and farther to take of all ſuſpition, and jealouſies of this Match, and to put it almoſt into a ſtate of impoſſibility, he created <hi>Don Camillo</hi> Cardinal, to the great trouble, and diſappointment of the <hi>Barberins</hi>; who being now without Friends, or protection, remained expoſed to the ſcorn, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of the People; and to the covetous deſires of the Pope, who now caſting off all conſiderations to the Family of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> in deſpight of the Obligations he had to them, ſought for a pretence, or colour to ſeize th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:50681:375"/>The <hi>Barberins</hi> eſteeming their condition deſperate, unleſs they could regain the Protection, and favour of <hi>France,</hi> adventured to try their antient Friend Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> to whom they diſpatched a Courier Expreſs with a Letter, repreſenting their caſe to the Court of <hi>France</hi>; The Cardinal who was a dexterous Miniſter, and ſoon hit that point of Intereſt which concerned his Maſter, did with a moſt quick and piercing judgment conſider that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was then for the moſt part compoſed of a Faction entirely devoted to the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> and the Grand Duke, and of which the Pope himſelf was Chief: and that to counterpoiſe ſo prevailing a Party, it might be adviſeable to ſupport, and make uſe of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> who having ſtill ſome Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and Adherenrs of their own, might be able upon the credit of <hi>France,</hi> to keep the Cardinal <hi>Pamfilio,</hi> (formerly <hi>Don Camillo</hi>) the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and <hi>Florentines</hi> within ſome tolerable terms of modeſty, and moderation. This Propoſal being debated in the Council of <hi>France,</hi> was judged reaſonable, and agreed, that the <hi>Barberins</hi> ſhould be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into Protection, and favour, provided, that as pledges of their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Fidelity, they ſhould oblige themſelves to purchaſe Lands, and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes</hi> within the Dominions of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The unexpected news of the reſtoration of the <hi>Barberins</hi> to the favour of the <hi>French</hi> King, was ſtrangely ſurprizing at <hi>Rome,</hi> and much changed the Scene of Affairs; for the Commonalty converting their hatred into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, did much lament the perſecutions, which the <hi>Barberins</hi> undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly ſuſtained; but the Pope, and his Party being highly incenſed againſt Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> by whoſe ſole contrivance a Pardon was granted to the <hi>Barberins,</hi> laboured underhand with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> againſt him, moving him by a thouſand ill ſuggeſtions to deſtroy the Cardinal, and for his encouragement and reward, promiſed to advance his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Abbat <hi>de la Riviere</hi> to the degree of Cardinal; but all theſe Artifices produced little effect, for Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> without taking leave of the Pope ſecretly departing from <hi>Rome</hi>; arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> where caſting himſelf at the feet of the King was upon his ſubmiſſion received to Pardon, and favour. And now the reſtoration of the <hi>Barberins</hi> to the protection of <hi>France,</hi> being no longer a ſecret, both the Prefect, and Cardinal <hi>Franciſco</hi> with that whole Family loudly profeſſed themſelves Servants to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and in teſtimony thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed the Arms of <hi>France</hi> again over their Gates.</p>
               <p>The reception alſo of the <hi>Barberins</hi> to favour was ſignified by the King in a Letter to the Pope,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1645.</note> which was delivered by the hand of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Grimaldi,</hi> who was at that time employed in the Affairs of <hi>France</hi>; but this Letter operated little of good, but ſerved rather to irritate the mind of the Pope: for within three days afterwards he erected a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of five Cardinals, all Enemies to the <hi>Barberins</hi> to inſpect the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that Family, and to proceed by the methods of Law againſt them: ſo that Cardinal <hi>Franciſco,</hi> who was eſteemed innocent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable in his Converſation, and had not as yet been attacked by any, was cited to make his perſonal appearance before this Court, where an Act was intimated unto him, which annulled, and made void the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation which his Uncle <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> had made to indemnifie his Nephews, and exempt them from rendering an account of the publick Moneys which had paſſed through their hands: and in purſuance hereof <hi>Taddeo</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:50681:376"/>
the Prefect was enjoyned to bring in all the Accounts of Expences and Moneys which had iſſued out of the Chamber during the time of his Uncle, though the Books and Receipts were in the hands and Office of the Paymaſters. And in regard that Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> was abſent in <hi>France,</hi> a Brief was ſent him to appear perſonally at <hi>Rome</hi> within the ſpace of two months under pain of Excommunication, and forfeiture of all his Eſtate, Revenues, and Benefices which he held of the Church; and in the mean time Cardinal <hi>Franciſco,</hi> and the Prefect were obliged in a Bond of thirty thouſand Crowns to advertiſe Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> of theſe proceedings, and not to remove any of their Goods, Houſholdſtuff, Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, &amp;c. out of their Houſes at <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other place, ſequeſtring alſo the whole revenue of Cardinal <hi>Antonio.</hi> And whereas Cardinal <hi>Franciſco</hi> had been ſuperintendent over the Revenues of the Church, he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not only to give an account of the Moneys, but of all other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagements, and tranſactions during the Government of his Uncle.</p>
               <p>Theſe violent, and ſevere proceedings againſt the Nephews of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Pope, ſeemed a Policy diſagreeable to the inclinations and deſigns of <hi>Innocent,</hi> who intended to advance his Nephew Cardinal <hi>Pamfilio,</hi> and was as paſſionate towards his Relations as ever <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> had been, and more perhaps than he; for being wholly guided by the directions of <hi>Donna Olympia Mildachini,</hi> a Woman of untamed Pride and unſatiable Avarice; it was not to be imagined, that the Revenues of the Church ſhould be better employed, or uſed with more moderation than they were in the times of the late <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> was but of an ordinary extraction in <hi>Rome,</hi> but being married to Signior <hi>Pamfilio</hi> Brother to this Pope, made the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring which came from her to be illuſtrious; and for governing one, who governed the Church hath made herſelf famous in all the Hiſtories of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Eccleſtaſtical State. She was a Woman which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally affected Rule and Dominion; and therefore, becauſe her Husband croſſed her deſires, and would ſubject her to Obedience, ſhe had a quarrel to him, and held him in abhorrence and deteſtation, though his perſon was comely and handſom enough to be beloved: on the other ſide, none was more pleaſing, and acceptable to her than her Husband's Brother, firſt Abbat, and then Cardinal <hi>Pamfilio</hi>; for though he was one of the moſt ugly, and ill-favoured perſons in the World, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he never entered on any Affair either publick or private, before he firſt conſulted his Siſter-in-law, making her his Oracle, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with the entire diſpoſal of his Will, ſhe became perfectly ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of his Perſon, and Soul, and would never be ſeparated from his company. After he was created Pope, ſhe then took upon herſelf the State and Garb of a Princeſs, and ſeizing with abſolute Dominion, and Authority on the perſon of the Pope, exerted her Power to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that ſhe made the whole Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſubſervient to her Beck, and obſequious to her Commands. The greedineſs of the <hi>Barberins</hi> in amaſſing Money was the moſt exorbitant, that ever had been known before in <hi>Rome:</hi> but when this Woman came, ſhe ſwept with both hands, making the rapine, and extortion which had been uſed before, ſeem to be attempered with ſome qualifications of modeſty, and mercy. For no Judg of criminal Cauſes being made without her recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they all received their Inſtructions from her, which ſhe gave with
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:50681:376"/>
ſuch Rules and Methods, as conduced to her Avarice. She ordered them to bleed the Purſe, rather than the Veins of Malefactors; that all the Fines, and redemptions of the Guilty ſhould be ſent to her, that ſhe might employ them to the uſe and benefit of the Poor; by which means, and to ſatisfie the Judges, who would always have their ſhare in the Booty the Fines were raiſed beyond all the meaſures of Juſtice, and though complaints hereof were made unto the Pope, yet neither were the oppreſſed relieved, nor the Judges puniſhed.</p>
               <p>We have ſaid before, that the Pope had created his Nephew <hi>Don Camillo</hi> Cardinal, who was the Son of <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> and at her inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was declared Cardinal Patron, being a Title commonly confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the Pope's neareſt Relation; the which was done, to diſappoint the match between <hi>Camillo,</hi> and the Daughter of the Prefect. But this young Gallant being of a gay and light temper, and uncapable of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts, and buſineſs, was weary of his Cardinal's Hat, which againſt the conſent and without the knowledg of the Pope, and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he laid aſide to marry the Princeſs <hi>Roſſana,</hi> who by the death of her Husband the Prince was become a Widow. The news of this Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was ſtrangely ſurpriſing to all <hi>Rome,</hi> but more eſpecially to the Pope and his Siſter, who after a conference of two hours together in private, reſolved that Prince <hi>Camillo,</hi> and his Lady ſhould be baniſhed from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The diſgrace of theſe two perſonages, was as ſurpriſing to the World as was the Marriage; for there was in reality no Objection to the match, eſpecially ſince he was the onely branch of the Houſe of <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filio,</hi> whoſe noble change to joyn himſelf with a Lady of Beauty, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Riches, and Underſtanding, was conducing to that common deſire of mankind, which is to keep up, and perpetuate their Families: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there being no juſt reaſon why the Pope ſhould be diſpleaſed at the match; the cauſe of baniſhing the new married couple was attributed ſolely to <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> who being jealous of having the Princeſs Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or Corrival with her in the Government, thought fit to keep her at a diſtance from the Court. But the World in the mean time, could not but remain aſtoniſhed at this paſſage: for, it was wonderful to ſee a Pope ſo ſenſleſs, as to puniſh his Nephew for having directed his love to a Princeſs of equal quality with himſelf; whileſt he himſelf was ſo beſotted as to be given up to the extravagancy of an aſpiring Woman; permitting her to govern his Perſon, Church, State, and Court with an Imperious hand; and yet at the ſame time not to indulge his Nephew the love of a young, Noble, and beautiful Lady, who brought a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Patrimony to the Houſe of <hi>Pamfilio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> more kind, or leſs jealous of <hi>Nicolo Ludoviſio</hi> Prince of <hi>Piombino,</hi> who was married to her ſecond Daughter, on hopes that as Nephew to the Pope, he ſhould enter into Offices, and Affairs: for this Prince having been Nephew to <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. and Brother to that Cardinal Patron, who ſince the time of his Uncle abſolutely diſpoſed of all the Affairs of the Church, did now hope to find the ſame fortune, and reap the ſame benefit under this <hi>Innocent</hi> X. But <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> was too wiſe to admit a Nephew into the privacies of the Pope, or a Partner with her in buſineſs: for ſhe entirely beſtowed all Benefices, whether great or ſmall; the Officers of the Datary being charged to keep them
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:50681:377"/>
in hand, till ſhe had fully informed herſelf of the value: whatſoever Biſhoprick fell void, they that pretended to it, were to addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to her; Abbeys, Canons, and all other Dignities and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, were all conferred at the pleaſure, and command of <hi>Donna Olympia:</hi> there was no appearing with empty hands before her. The Rates of all Places were ſet, an Office of one thouſand Crowns a year for three years was valued at one years Revenue, and for ſix years at double; and ſo proportionably: if for life, then it was valued at twelve years, and the moiety thereof to be paid in hand.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Panzirolo</hi> who was then the great Favourite of the Pope and who tranſacted all Affairs, durſt yet act nothing without the conſent of this Lady, for ſuch an abſolute Aſcendant ſhe had over the Pope, that his Soul ſeemed to be animated with hers, and his Will ſubſervient to her dictates; and ſtrange it was to ſee her ſit in Council with the Pope with bundles of Memorials in her hands, to receive his Aſſent for formally onely unto that which ſhe had already determined: ſo that it is believed, ſhe had charmed him with ſome ſtrange diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Arts, Hiſtories having never given us an Example of the like nature.</p>
               <p>And now to give farther inſtances, and miracles of her Power, ſhe introduced into the place of Cardinal <hi>Pamfilio,</hi> (who had laid aſide his Scarlet to marry with the Princeſs <hi>Roſana</hi>) a certain Nephew of hers Son to her Brother, a youth of about eighteen years of age; who was afterwards called Cardinal <hi>Maldochino: Olympia</hi> intended once to have made him Cardinal Patron, but he was ſo great a Sot, and ſo ſtupid a Fool, that he was uncapable of Buſineſs, abhorred by the Pope, and a ſhame to the College and Dignity of Cardinals. The Office of Cardinal Patron was ever eſteemed of great Honour, and importance, and when managed by a Wiſe and dexterous Perſon, was of great eaſe, and relief to him who ſate in the Papal Chair: for if the Pope were ſick, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he gave Audience to Ambaſſadours, and preſided in the Council; ſubſcribed Letters to the Nuntios, Legats, and Governours of Provinces. But this help being as yet wanting to <hi>Innocent,</hi> for want of a Cardinal Nephew endued with ſome tolerable underſtanding; <hi>Olympia</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to adopt <hi>Camillo Aſtalli</hi> Brother of Marquis <hi>Aſtalli,</hi> who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her Niece into the Family of the Pope; with whom ſhe ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, that he created him Cardinal Patron, and gave him the name of <hi>Pamfilio,</hi> though not of the bloud, nor allied to his Family. It was wonderful to the Court, to ſee a young Man of twenty ſeven years of age, raiſed on a ſudden to ſo important a preferment. 'Twas true, he was endued with a gentile behaviour, and good addreſs, and with qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of mind ſufficient to make himſelf acceptable; but yet neither his years, nor his practice in Affairs enabled him to ſupport the great burden of Church, and State. In making of this Creature, as well <hi>Panzirolo,</hi> as <hi>Olympia</hi> was believed to concur; ſhe with a deſign to advance the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of him that had married her Niece; but he, to have an influence over all his actions, being well aſſured, that this young Man would act nothing without his direction. But whileſt <hi>Olympia</hi> thus governed all Affairs, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> became ſcandalous, nothing but libellous Jeſts to the diſparagement of the Pope were daily put into the hands
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:50681:377"/>
of <hi>Paſquin</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; In the Courts of the Emperour, of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the Nuntios ſeemed to loſe much of that Reverence, which was formerly given them; and when any of thoſe Princes were refuſed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands they made, and expected from the Pope; it was often ſaid with raillery, <hi>That if</hi> Donna Olympia <hi>had made the requeſt, it would readily have been granted.</hi> It was the common Diſcourſe in the Pulpits of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> that a Woman was Head of the Church, and the Univerſal Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and that now the myſtery of the Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> was plainly diſcovered. In the Proteſtant Countries, the Comedies, and Farces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Loves, and Intrigues of <hi>Innocent</hi> X. and <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> upon the Stage: all which the young Cardinal Patron, at the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Panzirolo</hi> made known to the Pope, who being conſcious of the truth thereof, and inwardly aſhamed, reſolved often to forbid <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympia</hi> the Court, and all concernment, or intermedling in Affairs; but knowing not how to come out with it, his inward grief ſuppreſſed his words: but at length taking courage and reſolution, he burſt out into tears, and therewith into words Interdicting <hi>Olympia</hi> all farther communication with the Court.</p>
               <p>After this, Cardinal <hi>Aſtalli,</hi> I ſhould have ſaid <hi>Pamfilio,</hi> gained ground in the affections of the Pope, and being guided by <hi>Panzirolo</hi> took daily deeper root in his eſteem; <hi>Panzirolo</hi> likewiſe himſelf kept in great credit, and unſhaken by his Adverſaries; but being tired with the burden of buſineſs, and continual watches, until after midnight in conſultations with the Pope, he fell ſick and died, Nature effecting that which his Enemies endeavoured.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal Patron above all lamented his loſs, preſaging thereby the miſchief, which afterwards enſued: for now <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> began, though <hi>Incognita,</hi> to frequent the Court, and by degrees to repoſſeſs her firſt Station. But we ſhall for a while leave this Lady weaving her Webbs, and managing Intrigues, and return again to the <hi>Barberins,</hi> whoſe Cauſe was taken into the defence and protection of <hi>France.</hi>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 1646.</note> and <hi>Taddeo</hi> the Prefect, in compliance with the Pope's Brief preſented their accounts, having had but fifteen days time allotted to bring them in; and in failure thereof were to forfeit five hundred Crowns a day for every day, until they were delivered. The Accounts being given, the Pope caſt his eyes upon them with much indignation and prejudice, not allowing them for true and legal, excepting againſt the ſum with which they had charged themſelves, which the Auditors would have to be eight Millions; But Counſel pleading in behalf of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> deſired for juſtification of them, it might be permitted to examine the Books of Accounts which were remaining in the Apoſtolical Chamber, to which for their own diſcharge they referred themſelves. But this Demand gave no ſatisfaction or ſtop to the proceedings of Court, whereby in an extraordinary manner, and without form of Law, the Eſtate belonging to the <hi>Barberins</hi> in the <hi>Monte,</hi> was ſequeſtred with all the other Rents belonging to them within the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other place within the Eccleſiaſtical Dominions: wherefore the <hi>Barberins</hi> being apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of farther proceedings againſt their Perſons, (after conſideration held with their Friends) both Cardinal <hi>Franciſco,</hi> and <hi>Taddeo</hi> the Prefect retired from <hi>Rome,</hi> and other parts within the Dominions of the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:50681:378"/>
Church to places of Sanctuary, and Refuge. In the mean time proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Court againſt them were carried on with greater rigour, and ſeverity; ſo that the news of their arrival in <hi>France</hi> was the common Diſcourſe of all <hi>Rome,</hi> and their reſolution therein greatly applauded by all indifferent perſons, to be prudent and agreeable to their preſent circumſtances, conſidering that the <hi>French</hi> King had eſpouſed their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and taken them into his care, and protection. But the little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and great neglect which the Pope ſeemed to ſhew to thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which the King made in behalf of the <hi>Barberins</hi> were ſo highly reſented by his Majeſty; that both the Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Great Duke (though an Enemy to them) greatly fearing that this Cauſe might introduce the <hi>French</hi> Arms into <hi>Italy,</hi> interceded with the Pope to moderate the anger he had conceived againſt the <hi>Barberins,</hi> and to allow of ſome Conditions, and expedients of Reconciliation; but all their good Offices were not able to give any ſtop, or arreſt of judgment, ſeiſure being made of their Eſtates, and Revenue, without any other reaſon, than <hi>quia hic placet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The news hereof being extreamly ill reſented at the Court of <hi>France</hi>; it was judged fit to ſend the Biſhop of <hi>Angiers</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> to confer with Cardinal <hi>Grimaldi</hi> upon this matter, that ſo a greater Authority might be given to his Negotiations. The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Venice</hi> being recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from <hi>Rome</hi> by the Senate, before his departure thence, conſulted with Cardinal <hi>Grimaldi,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Angiers</hi> in what manner to govern his Diſcourſe at his laſt Audience; and having taken his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from them, he warmly applied himſelf to the Pope, repreſenting the danger of a War with <hi>France,</hi> and that it was not prudent for the Cauſe of a private Family, and to gratifie ſome particular grudges, to engage the Church, and all <hi>Italy</hi> in publick calamities: but the Pope ſeeming regardleſs of all thoſe conſiderations, replied, That it became not his greatneſs to capitulate with his Subjects; but in caſe the <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins</hi> would voluntarily come in, and throw themſelves at the feet of his mercy, he would ſhew them ſuch favour, as the World might take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, how much the inſtances of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> in their behalf had prevailed upon him.</p>
               <p>But theſe general terms and uncertain expreſſions giving no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the <hi>French</hi> Court, the King wrote to his Ambaſſadours at <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> where the general Peace of Chriſtendom was then in Treaty, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them to give that Aſſembly to underſtand the Paſſion he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the Cauſe of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> was ſuch as would obſtruct all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, unleſs ſome Expedients were contrived, and ſome Conditions provided for their ſecurity, and reſtoration: by which the Pope was made ſenſible that the King reſolved to carry theſe matters to the higheſt extremity.</p>
               <p>The Abbot of St. <hi>Nicolas</hi> having now for ſome time remained at <hi>Rome,</hi> and informed himſelf of the true ſtate of the Controverſie with the <hi>Barberins,</hi> he demanded Audience, and being thereunto admitted, he preſented his Letters of Credence, which the Pope received with many obliging expreſſions; letting fall a few tears from his Eyes, when he declared how much he loved the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and how affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate he had ſhewed himſelf thereunto, even to a Paſſion; of which his Chriſtian Majeſty was ſo ſenſible, that had the whole Power of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave</hi>
                  <pb n="303" facs="tcp:50681:378"/>
been in the King, he was perſuaded, he would have created him Pope, in excluſion of all others in the World. But the Abbat was little ſurpriſed with thoſe tears, eſteeming them no indications of his mind, but his uſual preparations to important Treaties; proceeded to diſcourſe in favour of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> whom he beſeeched to receive again into his grace, and good will; which though his Maſter might expect from him, as a point of Juſtice, yet he would take it as an act of kindneſs, and Obligation to himſelf.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Barberins</hi> ſhould make their ſubmiſſion in ſuch humble terms, as he ſhould require, and direct; and all things ordered to the greater reputation, and glory of his Holineſs; that the refuſal hereof would diſturb the quiet of Chriſtendom, obſtruct the general Peace in Treaty at <hi>Munſter,</hi> and hinder the ſuccours, which were then preparing to give the Catholicks in <hi>England</hi>; and in fine, would be the cauſe of great confuſion and diſturbance in <hi>Europe.</hi> In anſwer hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, the Pope deſired the Abbat to repreſent unto the Queen Regent how much the <hi>Barberins</hi> had ruined the Church by the expence of more than twenty Millions, which they had charged upon the People by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable Impoſitions, to maintain a War againſt the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> for which no juſtifiable account could be given; that they had ſo abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Authority and Government of the Church in the laſt years of their Uncle's Pontificate, that all the World cryed out for juſtice and vengeance againſt them: and if now after all theſe miſchiefs they ſhould find refuge, and protection for their crimes in <hi>France,</hi> the Nephews of Popes would for the future become licentious, and not fear what they acted, or deſigned, when after the example of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> they might hope to find a Sanctuary and impunity for their crimes, if not in <hi>France,</hi> yet at leaſt in <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> or ſome other Prince, where they were able to make an Intereſt, or a friendſhip. That the Avarice, and ambition of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> was beyond all example; having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a Revenue of above two hundred and fifty thouſand Crowns a year, beſides their many Benefices and immenſe Riches, which they had concealed, and the magnificent furniture of their Palaces, which out of reſpect to their Majeſties of <hi>France</hi> he had ſuffered to remain without ſeiſure or confiſcation. With theſe and the like Arguments was the cauſe of the <hi>Barberins</hi> debated between the Pope, and the Abbat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any effect, and the Audience ending without ſatisfaction to either ſide; the Cardinals of the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt concluded, that nothing would be done until ſuch time, as that the ſucceſs of the Siege of <hi>Orbetello</hi> were known, and the Fate of that place determined.</p>
               <p>For now the Faction of the <hi>Barberins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1646.</note> and particularly Cardinal <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maldi,</hi> being ſenſible that nothing would operate ſo eaſily with the Pope, as the near approach of the <hi>French</hi> Arms to the Dominions of the Church, prevailed with Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> to ſend a Fleet to the Siege of <hi>Orbetello.</hi> In purſuance of this deſign (which was kept with great ſecrecy) the <hi>French</hi> Fleet commanded by the Duke <hi>de Breze,</hi> and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with ſome Troopes by Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> landed their Forces at the Port of St. <hi>Steffano,</hi> of which they eaſily made themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as alſo of the Lands of <hi>Talamone,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> had guarded with a very inconſiderable Garriſon; and afterwards the Duke <hi>de Breze</hi> came to an Anchor before the Port of <hi>Orbetello.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:50681:379"/>The news of the <hi>French</hi> Arms before <hi>Orbetello</hi> alarm'd the City of <hi>Rome</hi> with great terrour; and ſo ſenſibly affrighted the Pope himſelf, that he evidently diſcovered a mind much more flexible to the Cauſe of the <hi>Barberins</hi> than formerly, moderating his Sentence, and granting many things in their favour, which he had lately refuſed. The other Princes alſo of <hi>Italy,</hi> who were their implacable Enemies, growing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the near approach of danger, became earneſt Interceſſours with the Pope to give all the ſatisfaction he was able to the Crown of <hi>France</hi>; to which the Pope lending a gentle Ear, was contented that the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> ſhould make of himſelf at his City of <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> ſhould be eſteemed as a point of ſubmiſſion; and from thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Letters from him, he ordered the Commiſſioners of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to take off the Sequeſtrations which were laid on their Revenue, and Eſtate; for which firſt ſtep of Grace Cardinal <hi>Grimaldi</hi> returned thanks to the Pope in a full Conſiſtory. But no ſooner was <hi>Orbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tello</hi> ſuccoured by the Marquis of <hi>Torrecuſo,</hi> who was diſpeeded with a conſiderable body of Men by the Vice-King of <hi>Naples</hi>; and the <hi>French</hi> forced to raiſe their Siege and return to <hi>Tolon,</hi> with the loſs of the Duke of <hi>Breze</hi> their Admiral; but the Pope reaſſuming again his antient diſpleaſure and hatred againſt the <hi>Barberins,</hi> retracted all the favours, and conceſſions he had lately granted to them, and inveighing againſt Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> with bitter words, called him a Betrayer of his Country, and unworthy the Purple with which the Church had cloathed him; having for the ſake of his own ambitious deſires, and envy to the flouriſhing Eſtate of the Houſe of <hi>Pamfilio,</hi> endeavoured to involve <hi>Italy</hi> in a moſt ruinous, and dangerous War.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1647.</note>But theſe invectives which the Papal party uſed againſt the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſerved to no other end than to provoke his choler, and whet his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of revenge: ſo that having fitted out another Fleet not inferiour in number, and ſtrength to the former, commanded by the <hi>Mareſchals de Milliarey,</hi> and <hi>Pleſſis Praſlin,</hi> they quitted the deſign againſt <hi>Orbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tello,</hi> and <hi>Portohercole,</hi> and ſailed to <hi>Piombino,</hi> and <hi>Portolongone</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Elba</hi>; the firſt being a place bordering on <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a paſſage into the Dominions of the Pope, was eſteemed convenient and advantageous againſt the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſuch as might curb the Pope, and render him more reſpectful to the Intereſt of <hi>France</hi>; the other being ſituate between <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> was judged of great importance for intercepting ſuccours, and correſpondencies between one and the other Territory. The firſt attempt therefore was made upon <hi>Piombino,</hi> which being defended by ſome few Troops of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe, and a weak Garriſon within, upon appearance of a Battery of five Pieces of Cannon raiſed againſt it, capitulated, and ſurrendered itſelf. The ſucceſs of <hi>Piombino</hi> ſtrook a terrour into the Defendants of <hi>Portolongone</hi>; which notwithſtanding was for ſome time defended by the Garriſon; but the <hi>French</hi> having prepared ſome Mines, and being ready to make a general ſtorm the Defendants demanded a Parly, and ſurrendered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on honourable Conditions; the which places the <hi>French</hi> looked upon, as ſo conſiderable, as might be worth the labour, and charge of ſtronger Fortifications.</p>
               <p>The news hereof being brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> did immediately ſilence the Party oppoſite to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and again mollifie the mind of the Pope in
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:50681:379"/>
ſuch manner, that he began to give favourable Audiences to the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, and to hearken again with ſome gentleneſs to thoſe Propoſals, which were made in behalf of the <hi>Barberins</hi>; howſoever, he could not frame his mind to the promotion of Frier <hi>Michael Mazarin</hi> to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Cardinal, for his heart was ſo full of diſtance againſt his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Chief Miniſter of <hi>France,</hi> that he could not contain his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but ever vented them, ſo often, as he had occaſion to diſcourſe with any of the <hi>French</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>It happened at that time that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being at <hi>Rome,</hi> was admitted to Audience with the Pope, and received with all the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of joy, and tenderneſs imaginable, it being the cuſtom of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> to abound in his exceſſive demonſtrations of love towards that Nation, which he inwardly abhorred and deteſted. The Duke having this opportunity took the liberty to lay before <hi>Innocent</hi> the preſent State of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and particularly that of <hi>France,</hi> which was now governed entirely by Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> a Perſon ſo wedded to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of that Crown, that it were injuſtice to ſeparate one from the other, and that indeed he was ſo riveted in the favour of the Queen Regent, and of all the great Men of that Court, (ſome few perſons only excepted) that his Holineſs could not exerciſe effects of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt the perſon of the Cardinal without diſobliging the noble Court, and Nation of <hi>France.</hi> That the Cardinal deſired nothing more than the favour of his Holineſs, and to live in peace and amity with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> on which condition and upon the leaſt demonſtration of kindneſs, the Cardinal would be ready to yield all obſequious ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his moſt Holy Perſon, and would adore, and reverence him with higheſt eſteem. But to make the firſt ſtep herein he told him, that it was neceſſary to call Frier <hi>Mazarin</hi> from <hi>Aix</hi> where he was Arch-biſhop, unto <hi>Rome,</hi> and freely and generouſly to confer upon him the Dignity of Cardinal; for that by this means obliging the Arch-biſhop, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining him by preferments near his Perſon, he would eaſily become his Creature, and probably ſo influence his Brother, that all miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and diſguſts between the Courts of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, a happy correſpondence, and peace would enſue for the future. The Pope approving this Diſcourſe, and propoſal of the Duke, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gave order to call Frier <hi>Mazarin</hi> then reſiding at his Arch-biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Aix,</hi> unto <hi>Rome,</hi> with promiſes of advancement; of which the Duke gave advice to Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> his Brother; but this Expedient was ſo little ſatisfactory to the Cardinal, who was ever ſuſpicious of the Pope's good inclinations to himſelf and Family, that he endeavoured to diſſuade his Brother from the danger of an affront, being perhaps unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive any Obligations from the Pope, whom he believed, could never be heartily reconciled to his Perſon, and Intereſt: but the Arch-biſhop was ſo ambitious of the Scarlet, that contrary to the perſuaſions of his Brother, he poſted to <hi>Rome,</hi> where after ſome few months, he was created Cardinal, to the great ſatisfaction, and joy of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and of all the <hi>French</hi> Party, who expected from thence the happy fruits of Peace, and of a perfect underſtanding between <hi>France</hi> and the Papal Sea.</p>
               <p>Howſoever the mind of the Pope was not yet quieted,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1648.</note> nor could he forget his quarrel to the <hi>Barberins,</hi> though he ſeemed to be ſo far ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:50681:380"/>
as to admit of the return of Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> which grant was obtained by the Marquis <hi>de Fontena,</hi> who ſucceeded the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> in the Agency for <hi>France</hi>; but howſoever he could not ſo far prevail, as to obtain the like favour for Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> whom the Pope deteſted, and would not hear of his admiſſion, until he had given in his Accounts, and anſwered the Crimes of which he was legally accuſed, as his Brother had already performed. Nor would the Pope admit the Son of <hi>Taddeo</hi> the Prefect, a youth of about eighteen years of age, to execute that Office, during the abſence of his Father, retired (as we have ſaid) to the Court of <hi>France</hi>; though preſſed with the moſt warm inſtances imaginable, by the Marquis <hi>de Fontena,</hi> the Pope poſitively refuſing it as a judged caſe already by the College of Cardinals in the time of <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. when the Son of <hi>Antonio Colonna,</hi> though in joint commiſſion with his Brother, was declared uncapable to exerciſe that charge in the time of his Minority.</p>
               <p>For indeed the Pope did not much conſider the applications made from <hi>France</hi> in any Affair, nor was he greatly concerned to ſatisfie their Miniſters, knowing that the Civil Wars at that time, had ſo employed the hearts and hands of that Kingdom that no miſchief could be derived from thence. Nor did <hi>Innocent</hi> ſhew himſelf much more favourable to any Nation, for the Emperour could obtain no other help in his Wars againſt <hi>Sweden,</hi> than a few Indulgences, ſo that he was forced to patch up a Peace to the diſadvantage of the Empire, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> received nothing but flat denials to all demands, as the <hi>Conte d' Ognate,</hi> and the Duke <hi>dell' Infantado</hi> who were then Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours did often complain. The <hi>French</hi> required nothing beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> for if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could obtain nothing, who had been chief Inſtruments in the Pope's Election, what could the <hi>French</hi> expect who remained as out-lawed people, and as Enemies to himſelf, and party. Nor did <hi>Innocent</hi> after the Example of other Popes intereſt, and concern himſelf much in the quarrels between the Chriſtian Princes: or like thoſe who eſteeming themſelves the univerſal Fathers, interpoſed by their Agents in the Offices of Peace, and Mediation; but <hi>Innocent</hi> caſting off thoſe cares, and by the advice, and counſel of <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> being deſirous to excuſe the charge, and expence of Nuntios in forein Courts, as uſeleſs and unneceſſary, took up new Maxims, and grounds of State: having an Opinion, that the interceſſions of Popes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed little with Princes, until their own conveniences, and preſſures by War inclined them to a Peace.</p>
               <p>It is reported, that <hi>Innocent</hi> looking out one day at his Window ſaw two Porters at Fifty-cuffs; ſome that were ſtanders by, would have part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, but the Pope forbad it, giving Order that they ſhould fight it out: They, after half an hours ſcuffle, being weary, and out of breath, gave over of themſelves, and without other mediation parted: which when the Pope ſaw, he turned to <hi>Pan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irolo</hi> (who was then living) <hi>So,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>will the</hi> French, <hi>and</hi> Spaniards <hi>do; for when they are well wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with beating one another they will part, and agree of themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mediation of others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Innocent</hi> was not ſo wholly averſe from ſending Nuntios into forein parts, but that with concurrence and approbation of his <hi>Olympia,</hi> he was ready to ſpend Money in Negotiations, which were judged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:50681:380"/>
and neceſſary for the welfare of the Eccleſiaſtical State: in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of which aim, conſidering it of abſolute neceſſity to have a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at the Treaty of <hi>Munſter,</hi> where the general peace of Chriſtendom was in debate; he appointed <hi>Fabio Chigi</hi> a <hi>Seneſe</hi> to be preſent at that Meeting, who with <hi>Aloiſio Contareni</hi> a <hi>Senator</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and both Men of experience, were by general conſent admitted Mediators: The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Commiſſioners were <hi>Lodowick</hi> Count of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> Doctor of the Civil Law, to them afterwards Count <hi>Trotmanſdorff</hi> a perſon of extraordinary Abilites was ſuperadded. <hi>Avoſſie</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient</hi> appeared in behalf of <hi>France.</hi> Count <hi>Pignoranda,</hi> and one <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio â Sequanis,</hi> who with his two Pages in a ſlaſhed Suit, and a tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Coach, was of greater importance to the Work, than half the Meeting beſides, were Commiſſioners for the <hi>Spaniard</hi>; and Count <hi>Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne,</hi> and <hi>John Sauge Oſnabrugge</hi> for the <hi>Swede</hi>; who being Proteſtants had a Seat appointed for them apart, that they might not mingle with the Catholicks. <hi>Paw</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and <hi>Knute</hi> the <hi>Zelander,</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for <hi>Holland,</hi> were of greater eminency than thoſe from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces: to <hi>Avoſſie</hi> and <hi>Servient, Longueville</hi> of the bloud Royal of <hi>France,</hi> was afterwards added, entering <hi>Munſter</hi> with a train like an Emperour. Theſe were the chief Miniſters which graced the Meeting at <hi>Munſter,</hi> beſides ſeveral Acceſſories ſent by their reſpective Princes. <hi>Fabio Chigi</hi> being of a mild, and patient temper, did diligently remove all ſuch things, as he judged might obſtruct, or retard the buſineſs of Peace; but <hi>Contareni,</hi> though a Man of able parts, yet being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, did ſometimes proceed with more violence, than warineſs.</p>
               <p>It will not be pertinent to this Hiſtory, to relate the particulars of this Treaty, what jugling, and what Sophiſtry was practiſed. How much Money; how much time was idly thrown away; how many Letters were written in Ciphers, and how many deciphered; what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon Punctilios; never did an Aſſembly more gloriouſly play the Mad-men, as if this Serious Meeting had been held about the place of Princes, not for the peace of Chriſtendom. In ſhort therefore as to what concerns our purpoſe, The <hi>Hollanders</hi> impatient for a peace, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the <hi>French</hi> ſucceſſes with a jealous Eye, reſolved to improve the preſent opportunity, and without the advice, and conſent of the <hi>French,</hi> to ſtrike up a perpetual Peace with <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> reſenting this manner of proceeding by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> ſent to the <hi>Hague</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but without any effect, that people after their uſual cuſtom, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring their quiet, and eaſe from War, before the Leagues, and faith, and promiſes made with, and given to their Allies. And thus this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly the moſt famous next to that of <hi>Trent,</hi> for the reſort of divers Nations, was diſſolved without any effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chigi</hi> the Pope's Nuntio, labouring much toward the general Peace, had ſtill in his Eye the deſign of conſerving the Revenue, and immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Church free, and entire; but finding that by the Articles of this haſty Peace, a great part of the Eccleſiaſtical Revenue was remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and many Benefices of the Church abandoned to the diſpoſal and poſſeſſion of Enemies to the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea, did in a ſolemn manner pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt this Peace, remonſtrating all the damages, and loſſes, which did thereby accrue to the Apoſtolical Chair: And ſo well, and with ſuch Art did <hi>Chigi</hi> manage this, and other Affairs, that at his return

to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was promoted by this Pope to the degree of Cardinal; and afterwards had the good fortune to ſucceed him in the Papal Throne.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Oſnaburgh</hi> almoſt at the ſame time, was the agreement of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Peace concluded, without the intervention of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; by which means the <hi>Swedes</hi> gained the <hi>French</hi> Aſſent to the Capitulations, but the Princes, and Free-States of the Empire having little to ask beſides the exerciſe of their Religion, reſted ſatisfied with the enjoyment thereof, and liberty of Conſcience to ſerve God after their own faſhion, which ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred <hi>Chigi</hi> the Nuntio, that he tore the papers about the Peace, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never more to interpoſe therein.</p>
               <p>During theſe tranſactions abroad, the Pope continued in his perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the <hi>Barberins</hi> to the utmoſt ſeverity, and yet being in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with Cardinal <hi>Barberin,</hi> he would with much tenderneſs weep, and lament the unhappy fate of their Houſe, terming his tears effects of compaſſion (which he had always ready to vent) which others cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led tears of joy, to ſee the poor Cardinal at his feet, reduced by him to the utmoſt extremity of Fortune. All which ill treatment was againſt the former pretenſions and Promiſes of the Pope, who had given faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſurances to the Marquis <hi>de Fontenay</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi>; that in caſe this Cardinal would return to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo as that he might have one hours diſcourſe with him, he would forget and pardon all the late quarrels, and would enter into as ſtrict Friendſhip with him, and his Family, as he had ever entertained with them before he was Pope; but contrary to this faith given, the Cardinal was entertained with all the contempt and ſcorn imaginable, notwithſtanding that <hi>France</hi> had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it ſelf engaged in the quarrel, and reſented all the Affronts given to that Houſe in the ſame manner, as offered to their own natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or to any Family of higheſt quality, and eſteem with that Court. Notwithſtanding which, it had been the ultimate conſummation of all the joys which could have happened to the Pope, could he have onely allured the Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> by promiſes, and perſuaſions to <hi>Rome</hi>; for then in deſpight of all his Vows, and Engagements, he would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed his Family, his Reputation, and his very triple Crown in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his Revenge, and for deſtruction of that perſon whom, (Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> excepted) he hated above all things in the World.</p>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 1651.</note>Never was the Intereſt of <hi>France</hi> in that low ebb in <hi>Rome</hi> as it was in this year, when the Civil Wars and diſtractions of that Kingdom ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered its Power leſs formidable abroad. And ſo the Pope preſuming on the ill ſtate of thoſe Affairs, little eſteemed the character of Ambaſſadour which the Bailly of <hi>Valency</hi> maintained at <hi>Rome</hi> for the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> ſuffering him to receive many Affronts from his Soldiers without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, or ſatisfaction; for which cauſe the Ambaſſadour retired to <hi>Tivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> whileſt the Pope contrived to diſpoſſeſs him of the Palace of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> which he inhabited at <hi>Rome:</hi> telling the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Venice,</hi> that whenſoever a reconciliation ſhould be made between him and <hi>France,</hi> the firſt Article ſhould be, that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour ſhould quit that Palace.

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:50681:381"/>
and ſcornful treatment, which his Majeſty had received from him ſince his aſſumption to the Papal Chair; and accordingly being admitted to Audience, he repreſented, That all thoſe Cardinals, whom <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. his Father of glorious memory had gained to his Party, and allied by his friendſhip, were now become the only mortal Enemies of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſome of which he had exiled from <hi>Rome,</hi> and others, whom he had permitted to remain in the City, he had rendered ſo uneaſie in their Habitations, that baniſhment was much more deſireable, than the liberty he gave them to reſide and breath within the precincts and air of his Court. Witneſs the Cardinals, <hi>Brichi, Grimaldi, Antonio,</hi> and <hi>Mazarine,</hi> all which received ſuch daily affronts, and diſcountenances, for devoting themſelves to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> that it was a capital crime ſo much, as to own a concernment for that Party. That he had made <hi>Medicis</hi> the Protectour of <hi>Spain,</hi> but <hi>Barberin</hi> retained no more than a ſhadow of it, for <hi>France.</hi> In ſhort, he omitted no inſtances whereby he might make known the injuſtices done to the Houſe of <hi>Barberin:</hi> and the Affronts offered to the King, and particularly by the ſuccours given to <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Portolongone</hi> to the prejudice of <hi>France.</hi> But the Pope returned no ſolid Anſwer hereunto; but broke out into paſſion and a hundred exclamations, which after his manner he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with tears, and in fine complained of the Cardinals devoted to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt to be perſons in whom he could not confide, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſatisfaction in their Society or correſpondence.</p>
               <p>The Pope being in this manner diſturbed, and tormented with the continual importunities of the <hi>French</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into conſultation with his moſt intimate Confidents of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction concerning the means, whereby he might eaſe himſelf, and throw off theſe daily vexations. This matter being conſidered, an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient was projected, to draw off the <hi>Barberins</hi> totally from the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt; and having joined them by the <hi>Pamfilian,</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Party, the Faction of <hi>France</hi> would be inconſiderable in the <hi>Conclave</hi>; and to give a beginning hereunto the Pope would often ſmile, and caſt a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Eye on Cardinal <hi>Barberin,</hi> ſo often as he ſaw him in the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, ſeeming as it were to entertain ſome thoughts of entire reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with his Family. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo to inſtil this Opinion, and make it to be ſwallowed more glibly down, offered ſome advantageous Propoſitions of Marriage for the Princeſs <hi>Paleſtrina</hi> with a conſiderable Perſon of their Country; not that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had any ſuch real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, but onely by this Overture to give occaſion unto <hi>Barberin,</hi> to write unto Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> giving them to underſtand, that ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had offered a convenient Match for his Niece; it was not reaſonable to neglect that Propoſal, unleſs they reſolved to provide more honourably for her in <hi>France,</hi> where ſhe was depoſited as a Pawn for the fidelity of her Family with the Queen Regent.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> obſerving by theſe paſſages, that <hi>Barberin</hi> was ſtaggering in his adherence to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, ſignified his thoughts thereupon to the Count <hi>de Brienne</hi> principal Secretary; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing it as abſolutely neceſſary for confirmation of the <hi>Barberins</hi> in their engagements to <hi>France,</hi> that the Queen ſhould match the Princeſs with one of the moſt illuſtrious Families of the Kingdom; not that any Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:50681:382"/>
was required from her Majeſty; for that this Lady had ſufficient of her own Eſtate beſtowed by her Uncle <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. to make her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the greateſt Peer of <hi>France</hi>; onely that ſhe would be pleaſed as a Jewel from her Cabinet, and with other obliging circumſtances to beſtow her on ſome great Lord, that was moſt devoted to the Intereſt of her Majeſty. And farther the Ambaſſadour preſſed, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give the Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> ſome ſpeedy anſwer hereunto, leſt deſpairing of any ſubſtantial benefit from <hi>France,</hi> he ſhould cloſe with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had promiſed to reſtore him forty thouſand Crowns a year, which he held in Abbies within the Dominions of his Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Majeſty, ſo ſoon, as he had given teſtimony of his detachment from the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt. That the Cardinal apprehended, that <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rine</hi> had no real kindneſs for him, and would never aſſent to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Princeſs <hi>Paleſtrina</hi> with any conſiderable Match, which he reſerved for one of his own Nieces.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of the Ambaſſadour's Letter being well conſidered; it was judged neceſſary to gratifie the <hi>Barberins</hi> with ſome thing more than words; and accordingly Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> was made Grand Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner of <hi>France,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> created Biſhop of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour ſignified to the Pope with ſuch formality, as gave matter of diſcourſe to all the Court. But notwithſtanding all theſe evidences of favour the conſtancy of the <hi>Barberins</hi> was not able to withſtand the favourable conjuncture which offered it ſelf for an entire reconciliation with the Pope: for none was more ready to embrace this offer than Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> who now having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt eight years an Exile from <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> and living in forein parts at the expence of ſome Millions, beſides the ſequeſtration of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue from the Church, was infinitely deſirous to cloſe with any reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Propoſitions which might reſtore him to favour, and his Eſtate.</p>
               <p>The deſign hereof was projected by <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> who made this Propoſition to Cardinal <hi>Franciſco:</hi> that in caſe he would aſſent to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Son of <hi>Taddeo</hi> the Prefect with the Daughter of her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Prince <hi>Juſtiniani,</hi> ſhe would reſtore the <hi>Barberins</hi> to all their Offices, Revenues, and intimate favour with the Pope; provided that this Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation ſhould be valued the price of her Portion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Barberins</hi> looking on this unexpected Offer as a bleſſing from Heaven, made this ſpeedy and ſhort Anſwer, <hi>That they ſhould eſteem themſelves much honoured, and happy in ſuch an Alliance</hi>; for having been for almoſt eight years under a Cloud, and a great part of their Revenue ſeized; they began to fear, that if <hi>Innocent</hi> ſhould die, his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour would detain their Revenues, and confer them on his own Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> had contrived to have the match with the eldeſt Son of <hi>Don Taddeo</hi>; but the <hi>Barberini,</hi> though very earneſt to have the matter concluded, yet pretended, that the eldeſt reſolving to be a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, had relinquiſhed his Birthright to his youngeſt Brother, who in recompence thereof had made a reſignation of his Abby to him, that was the elder. This was a ſubtle Maſterpiece of their Art, for by this means being reſtored, they got another Red Cap, a thing not known of before, to have three Cardinals at the ſame time of the ſame name and Family.</p>

                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:50681:382"/>Theſe reſolutions being carried on with great ſecrecy, advices thereof were diſpeeded in Characters to Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi>; who wearied with the promiſes, and expectations of <hi>France,</hi> and with the delays of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who, (as he was perſuaded) deſigned no good to his Family; joyfully embraced the Propoſition, and immediately with privacy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed his Niece the Princeſs <hi>Paleſtrina</hi> unto <hi>Padoua:</hi> the unexpected news whereof, and the ſtrange change of Affairs in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſurpriſed the whole World, but more eſpecially the Queen Regent of <hi>France,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> the chief Miniſter, who now began too late to conſider of the cold entertainment given the <hi>Barberins,</hi> and that more ſubſtantial preferments ſhould have been beſtowed on them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and ever oblige them to the Intereſt of <hi>France:</hi> for indeed they were were grown very high in their own imaginations, and could not ſtoop to a mean, or to an indifferent way of living; for when they conſidered of the long R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And now Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> being returned to <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1653.</note> the Scene was miraculouſly changed; for not only was <hi>Charles</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Taddeo</hi> created Cardinal, and their Niece married to the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> a Prince of a noble deſcent, but Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> was admitted to the Cabinet-Counſel which was compoſed of the Pope, <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> the Cardinal-Patron, and <hi>Monſignor Azzolini,</hi> who was Guard of the Briefs a place of great care, and truſt: they now governed with <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> all the important Affairs of the Church; and were in ſuch high eſteem with the Pope, who denied them no favours, that being Men well practiſed in the Government, and in the manner of Popes Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites they ſo well managed their own affairs, that in the two laſt years of <hi>Innocent</hi>'s Reign, they licked themſelves whole, and repaired the loſſes, which their eight years abſence, and diſgrace had brought upon their Eſtates. Nor is it to be wondred, that the Pope ſhould add an other Cardinal to this Family, though there were two already of great eſteem therein, ſince there was this juſtice, and reaſon for it. It hath been an antient and common cuſtom, for Popes to beſtow their own Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Hat on the kindred of that Pope, from whom he had received his: ſo that <hi>Innocent,</hi> who was created Cardinal by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII, and being obliged to relinquiſh his Red Hat, ſo ſoon as he was created Pope, was alſo obliged to beſtow it on one of the <hi>Barberins</hi> at their inſtance; but they being under a cloud of his disfavour, could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this juſt requeſt, until after their reconciliation, when, it was not farther to be delayed, or refuſed to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:50681:383"/>So ſoon as the <hi>Barberins</hi> were fully reſtored, and received into inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate favour with the Pope, the Power of the Cardinal Patron began to decline, being ſeldom, or never admitted to ſecret Conſultations: ſo that Ambaſſadours to make the ſhorter work, omitting the uſual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs by way of the Cardinal Patron, applied themſelves to the <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,</hi> to whom the Pope began to diſcloſe all the ſecrets of his heart, being confident of ſucceſs by the reputation they had gained in the management of Affairs for the ſpace of twenty two years of their Uncle's Reign; ſo that there remained but a ſhadow of Power to the adopted Nephew. For as the Authority and Intereſt of the <hi>Barberins</hi> encreaſed, ſo that of the Cardinal Patron abated: at firſt the Pope ſeemed very cold, and neglective of him, but at length burſt out into ſtorms of rage, and indignation againſt him: he forbad him his preſence, baniſhed him the Court, deprived him of the title of <hi>Cardinal Patron,</hi> diſclaimed the Adoption to be his Nephew, with expreſs Order, that he ſhould no longer be called <hi>Pamfilio,</hi> but <hi>Aſtalli:</hi> all his Revenues, Offices, and Preferments were ſequeſtred, and at length was baniſhed from <hi>Rome,</hi> and not permitted to carry any of his moveables with him. Theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant changes, and ſports of fortune made moſt Men laugh, none being able to aſſign the Cauſe or Original thereof. For they could not attribute it to his Avarice or his unjuſt gains: for beſides his ordinary Emoluments, which might be worth to him about fifty thouſand Crowns a year, attended with a great expence, he had not laid up one farthing: the poor Man had once made a little Money of a vacant Benefice, which ſo ſoon as <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> had ſmelt out, ſhe ran with open mouth to the Pope, and complained, and cauſed him to refund all into her Apron.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Azzolini</hi> by excluſion of <hi>Aſtalli</hi> being created Cardinal was admitted into the Cabal, where deep deſigns, and plots were hatching; the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berins</hi> ſuggeſted the conquering of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> blaming the Pope, for not making his advantage of the Inſurrection of <hi>Maſinello</hi> in the year 1647. Howſoever in this declining Eſtate of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the deſign upon <hi>Naples</hi> ſeemed very feaſible. The <hi>Barberins</hi> promiſed to maintain an Army of ten thouſand Men at their own coſt, until they had reduced that Kingdom to the Dominion of the Church: provided that the principality of <hi>Salerno</hi> might remain to their Family, independant of any other Prince: and with ſuch fancies, and projects as theſe, did they tire, and torment the decaying carcaſs of the dying Pope. But as the Pope daily languiſhed, ſo <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> was ever more induſtrious, taking bribes with both hands, beſtowing Benefices, and Livings in all parts of <hi>Italy</hi>; having in the <hi>Marca</hi> onely which is but a ſmall Province, diſpoſed of three hundred thirty ſix Benefices, which were commonly known, beſides what had paſſed underhand: and at that time the Sin of Simony was become ſo ſcandalous, and common, that People began to abhor Churchmen, and hate their Miniſtery, to which they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by abominable practices.</p>
               <p>Theſe tranſactions at <hi>Rome</hi> were equally diſpleaſing to the Courts both of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>; who now conſidering that the two Parties and Families of <hi>Pamfilio,</hi> and <hi>Barberin</hi> were united in one, they imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them able to ſtand on their own bottoms, and to have power ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to elect a Pope, in deſpight of thoſe two Kingdoms, or oppoſition
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:50681:383"/>
of the <hi>Medices</hi>; The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were moſt of all vexed at this Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, entertaining an inveterate hatred againſt the <hi>Barberins,</hi> to whom they attributed all the Affronts, and neglects paſſed upon them, in the time of their Uncle, and judged the loſs of <hi>Piombino,</hi> and <hi>Portolongone</hi> to proceed from them, and on ſcore of their quarrel with the Pope: the <hi>French</hi> alſo though angry enough with the perſon of Cardinal <hi>Barberin,</hi> whom they conſidered as unconſtant, faithleſs, and wedded to his own Intereſt; yet entertained more gentle thoughts of Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> whom having obliged with the honour of <hi>Grand Almoner</hi> of <hi>France</hi> with the Biſhoprick of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and the Order of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that the impreſſions they had made upon him, by ſuch obliging favours could never be defaced by time, or altered by a new Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Nor did they wholly loſe all hopes of conſerving this Intereſt, which was the cauſe, that when the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome</hi> made his Complement to young <hi>Barberin</hi> Son of the Prefect on his promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the degree of a Cardinal: he put him in mind of the good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence which had paſſed between his Uncle <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. and the Court of <hi>France</hi>; what affection that good Pope demonſtrated to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> IV. and after him to <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. and afterwards to his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty now reigning; the memory of which was ſo grateful to him, and the Queen Regent, that they could not but rejoice in all the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of their Family, wiſhing it might ſtill advance, and be exalted to a greater height of grandeur, and glory. And now all the Art was, and great labour uſed by the Pope, <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> to draw off Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> from his patiality, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment which he had a thouſand times vowed in the Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> the which abated much of their confidence in him, and gave a ſtop to many of their great deſigns: the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to keep him firm by many obliging favours; the Pope perſuaded him to a neutrality, which was moſt agreeable to a good <hi>Italian,</hi> and a religious Cardinal: his Brother urged him to caſt off the blue Ribbon of his Order, as incompatible with the great Croſs of <hi>Malta,</hi> and to entertain no intimate communication with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, nor to affix the Arms of <hi>France</hi> over the gate of his Palace: but <hi>Antonio</hi> giving no ear to any of theſe inſinuations, <hi>Franciſco</hi> plainly told the Pope, that the onely way to reclaim his Brother from the <hi>French,</hi> was to ſhew his diſpleaſure by refuſing to reſtore to him the Offices and Places of Truſt which <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. had conferred upon him, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow that of Great Chamberlain on his Nephew <hi>Charles</hi> lately made Cardinal: but this courſe ſeemed too violent both to the Pope, and <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> they took a contrary way, and cauſed a Brief to be carried to Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> for reſtitution of all his Offices and Places; the which was delivered him by the Prince of <hi>Paleſtrina</hi> his Nephew, that ſo he might ſeem to have gained theſe favours from the <hi>Pamfilians</hi>; and not from the <hi>French:</hi> After which Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> with all liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty avowed his concernment for <hi>France</hi>; which appeared much more generous to the Pope, than the diſſimulations of Cardinal <hi>Barberin,</hi> in whom the Pope could never retain a perfect confidence, nor an entire affection; that it is believed, had the Pope lived but ſome years lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he would have been as weary of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> as he had declared himſelf ſatisfied in them, after ſome few months experience of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:50681:384"/>
the misfortune of this Pope was, that he never knew how to make choice of a wiſe Chief, or Directour of his own Party. Cardinal <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filio</hi> was ever eſteemed as a Partiſan of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the <hi>Medices.</hi> His whole Family, Mother, Children, Daughters, Sons in law and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in law were engaged in mortal Feuds one againſt another. The Faction of the <hi>Barberins</hi> was not well united: for the greateſt part of the Creatures of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. entertained a ſecret rancour, and venom againſt Cardinal <hi>Francis Barberin,</hi> who after having vowed himſelf a thouſand times to the Intereſt of the Pope, of <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> and that Family, turned his Coat, and endeavoured with all obſequious diligence to be received into the Service and friendſhip of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having continued the Hiſtory of the <hi>Barberins</hi> with almoſt an uninterrupted courſe, or mixture of other Affairs, we muſt return a little back to other paſſages of moment which intervened in the Reign of this preſent Pope.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> which happened in the year 1649. the <hi>Montiſts</hi> wanting the uſual payments agreed by the Duke in the time of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. and afterwards confirmed by him at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the late Peace, made their complaints to the preſent Pope; upon which licenſe was obtained, and Briefs were iſſued from the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera</hi> to proceed againſt the Lands, and Eſtate poſſeſſed by that Duke in the ſtate of <hi>Caſtro.</hi> The proſecution of this matter was more violently carried on by the perſuaſions of <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> becauſe ſhe was diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with that Duke for not ſelling to her his <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, which was a certain Caſtle in the Dominion of <hi>Caſtro</hi>; and becauſe, as ſhe ſuppoſed, he had been inſtrumental in perſuading the Princeſs of <hi>Roſſano,</hi> who was his kinſwoman to take Sanctuary under the protection of <hi>France,</hi> from the Wiles, and Plots of her Step-mother; The Officers and Soldiers of the Duke made reſiſtance againſt the Commiſſioners of the <hi>Camera,</hi> who came to make ſeiſures for payment of the <hi>Montiſts</hi>; which greatly enraged the Pope, who was impatient, and frowned at the leaſt oppoſition made to his Commands; but the Great Duke of <hi>Toſcany</hi> apprehenſive, that the conſequences hereof might be an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a ſecond War, he endeavoured by means of Cardinal <hi>Albornozzi</hi> to compoſe the differences, making divers propoſitions to facilitate the payments, and ſatisfie the <hi>Montiſts:</hi> but whileſt theſe matters were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, it unfortunately happened that the Biſhop of <hi>Caſtro</hi> was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by certain Aſſaſſinates, who attended his paſſage on the confines of the Eceleſiaſtical State. The Pope being furiouſly enraged by the perpetration of this impious fact, which he attributed to the machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>; immediately diſpeeded certain Troops un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of <hi>David Vidman,</hi> and <hi>Girolamo Gabriel</hi> to lay Siege unto the City of <hi>Caſtro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time the <hi>French</hi> being Maſters of <hi>Piombino,</hi> and <hi>Portolongone,</hi> and having an Army in <hi>Lombardy</hi> under the command of the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> and <hi>Mareſchal du Pleſſis Praſlin,</hi> kept the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in awe, and gave countenance to the deſigns of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his right invaded by the Pope: the Duke encouraged by hopes given him by the <hi>French,</hi> and with an opinion that the Pope, who was aged, and loved eaſe and quietneſs would gladly compound upon reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable terms, ſo ſoon as he found himſelf preſſed by any vigorous oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition:
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:50681:384"/>
he therefore imitating the example of his Father raiſed a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Army, which he committed to the conduct of Marquis <hi>Gaufrid</hi> with Orders to march directly into the Dominions of the Pope; and leſt in their paſſage thither they ſhould commit Violences, or acts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility, or burden the people, he furniſhed Money ſufficient to defray all the charges neceſſary for maintenance of the Army; whereby he might make appear the caution he uſed to give no offence, and that his War was onely defenſive, and deſigned to no other end, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and maintain his own Subjects and Eſtate. This tenderneſs of doing hurt to any, had been well accepted, and interpreted, if the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had anſwered the hopes and expectations of the Duke: but the contrary happened out; for ſo ſoon as <hi>Gaufrid</hi> was entered into the Dominions of the Church, he was encountred by the Marquis <hi>Mattei</hi> a knowing, and an experienced Captain, to whom the Pope had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the charge, and defence of thoſe Countries; and being ſtrengthened by a conſiderable force, and with many Gentlemen Voluntiers, who came from <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Bologna</hi> to ſignalize their Valour; he gave Battel to the Enemy, and ſoon routed and defeated the Army of <hi>Parma</hi>; the General <hi>Gaufrid</hi> ſhamefully flying, fell under the heavy diſpleaſure and diſgrace of his Prince; and being accuſed by his Enemies of many enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crimes, and miſcarriages, and of not having obſerved the Orders of his Maſter, he was with much ignominy put to death; whereby he gave a new Example to the World of the mutability of fortune, which from an obſcure beginning and birth being raiſed on a ſudden to the higheſt degree of reputation and eſteem with his Maſter, was with as ſwift a turn tumbled, and precipitated down to an abyſs of ſhame and diſhonour.</p>
               <p>The Garriſon of <hi>Caſtro</hi> loſing all hopes of relief and ſuccours by this defeat, ſurrendered the Town upon Articles into the hands of the Pope; who being enraged for the murder committed on the Biſhop, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for expiation of that Offence, that the City ſhould be demoliſhed; and accordingly it was ſo entirely ruined, that not one ſtone remained upon another. The Duke in the mean time being terrified with theſe acts of ſeverity, and with the victorious Arms of the <hi>Pamfilians,</hi> who threatned the other Dominions of <hi>Parma</hi>; and finding that neither <hi>French,</hi> nor <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nor other Princes did much take his cauſe and ſufferings to heart, he reſolved to compound with the Pope by a ſale of the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Caſtro</hi> and <hi>Ronciglione</hi> with all the Territories and dependences thereunto belonging, with Power howſoever of Redemption within the ſpace of eight years. And thus ended theſe differences for the preſent, which ſeveral years afterwards broke out into new troubles; and will ever remain an occaſion of quarrel and ſcandal, until ſuch time as equal expedients and proportionate to juſtice are given for mutual ſatisfaction. After the City was thus deſtroyed, the Pope ſet up a Pillar with this Inſcription: <hi>Here was</hi> CASTRO; and ſeveral Croſſes in the places, where Churches had been with the ſame Motto: The Biſhoprick of <hi>Caſtro</hi> with all the Benefices, and emoluments thereof was afterwards annexed to the neighbouring Metropolis of <hi>Aquapendente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very certain, that this Pope was extreamly rigorous in doing juſtice, well vers'd in buſineſs, and might have deſerved the character of a skilful, and an underſtanding Perſon, had he not blemiſhed his
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:50681:385"/>
Reign with his unpardonable weakneſs towards a rapatious Woman: and therefore we ſhall as well repeat his good actions, as his bad, and give the Reader ſome inſtances of his Vertues, as well, as of his Vices.</p>
               <p>He was a ſevere lover of Juſtice in his Officers, and would puniſh thoſe Crimes in them which ſavoured of partiality, or corruption, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples hereof we have in many kinds: and particularly it is not to be forgotten, that a certain Nobleman of <hi>Rome</hi> having been guilty of many enormous Crimes, could not be protected from his Juſtice by the Power and Intereſt of his Friends, and Relations; for having threatned one of the Judges to be revenged one day upon him, in the vacancy of the Sea; he was apprehended, and accuſed upon thoſe words; which though they would bear no action in rigour, yet they were ſo ſeverely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted againſt him, being aggravated by his former Offences, that he was condemned to die, and accordingly ſuffered in the publick face of all the City. Another inſtance we have of his fortitude in the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Judg of the Court for Bribery, whom he committed to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and afterwards condemned to the Gallies. With the like impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and reſolution, he puniſhed the people of <hi>Firma,</hi> for having in a Mutiny, and Sedition killed Viſcount <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bert</hi> their Governour: in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of which juſtice, he ſent Count <hi>Vidman</hi> his chief Captain with ſome Troops againſt the City, that thoſe, who were the principal leaders in this Sedition might without fear, or favour be brought to condign puniſhment: and accordingly ſome were impriſoned, others baniſhed, others fined, or ſent to the Gallies, or put to death; and that he might attemper in ſome meaſure Clemency with his Juſtice, he enclined a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Ear to the ſubmiſſive petitions of that People, and received them into his gracious favour, and mercy. Nor was his juſtice leſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent in the puniſhment of <hi>Maſcambruno,</hi> who was Sub<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>datary of the Apoſtolical Chamber, in which Office having behaved himſelf without regard to the faith, and integrity required; he forged many falſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, affixing the Pope's Seal to them, and counterfeited his Hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other accuſations of bribery, and corruption; all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proved againſt him, he was deveſted of his Office, and dignity of Prieſthood, and publickly executed in the face of the whole City.</p>
               <p>It is alſo farther to be added in commendation of this Pope, that he reſtored the Elogy, which <hi>Alexander</hi> III had inſcribed in the great Hall of the <hi>Vatican</hi> in memory of the aſſiſtances, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had given to the Church; and which <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. without any juſt cauſe, or reaſon had blotted out, and defaced.</p>
               <p>He was alſo munificent in publick Buildings, and adornments of the City, and according to the generous temper of his nature had been much more, had not his Moneys been intercepted by <hi>Olympia.</hi> Howſoever he enlarged the common Priſons of the City, and built others, which were before ſo narrow, and ſtreight as to be noiſom, and unhealthy to the Priſoners. He alſo finiſhed the Walls of the City on the other ſide of the <hi>Tyber,</hi> which were begun by his Predeceſſour <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. He farther repaired, and adorned the Church of St. <hi>John Lateran,</hi> being much decayed ſince the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, who had built it for a Chappel to his Palace, and had been neglected by former Popes. But more eſpecially munificent was he towards the great Church of St.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:50681:385"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi>; for that a Memorial might remain of his Beneficence amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popes, to that place he added many and various Works, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified thoſe places which wanted Ornament; but what the particulars were will beſt appear by this following Inſcription, which was engraven over the great Gate of this Church.</p>

               <p>In the beginning of 1649. the year of Jubily approaching, he cauſed great proviſions to be made for entertainment of Pilgrims, and that there ſhould be no want of Bread, and Wine in the City, he ſent Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and Purveyors into all the neighbouring Countries to buy up the Corn, and fill up the granaries of the City; and leſt in ſo general a concourſe of people who flocked to enjoy the Indulgences, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons granted at that ſeaſon, Proviſions ſhould be raiſed to exceſſive Rates, care was taken to moderate the prices, and render every thing cheap and commodious for Pilgrims. On the 24th. of <hi>December</hi> 1649. the year of Jubily began, when the Pope in preſence of all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, Ambaſſadours, and Magiſtrates of the City opened the Holy Gate, which being again ſhut by him at the end of the following year, this Inſcription was engraven upon a Croſs of ſtone over the portal of the Gate:

About this time a Book was publiſhed in <hi>France,</hi> written by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Author, which aimed to ſubvert the Pope's Authority, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that there was an equality in Order, and Government between the Apoſtles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi>; or that the Authority of St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not ſubordinate to that of St. <hi>Peter.</hi> This Book falling under the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and ſcrutiny of the Inquiſition was condemned as heretical;
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:50681:386"/>
and the ſame Cenſure was paſſed thereupon by the Pope, who cauſed a Brief againſt it to be affixed in all publick places of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Opinions of <hi>Janſenius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ypres</hi> more ſucceſsfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi>; for prevention whereof, and to give a ſtop to the farther ſpreading of thoſe Tenents which were five in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, a Congregation compoſed of Cardinals, and Divines was appointed by <hi>Innocent</hi> to examine the ſeveral Articles, and to give their Opinion upon the ſame. And to quicken the Pope, and make him more zealous in the Work; both the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Queen Regent ſent their Letters to the Pope, deſiring him in a matter of ſuch importance (the determination whereof would tend to the ſettlement and quiet of Mens minds, and Conſciences) to interpoſe with the final Sentence of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, and Apoſtolical Doctrine. In like manner moſt of the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> deſired the Pope's diſtinct determination of every one of thoſe five Propoſitions: for though <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. of happy memory had in general terms publiſhed a Bull againſt the Book of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> and had confirmed the Decrees of <hi>Pius</hi> V. and <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. againſt <hi>Michael Baius,</hi> whoſe Doctrines concurred with thoſe of <hi>Janſenius</hi>; yet were not convincing to the multitude for want of a diſtinct explication, and particular Sentence againſt every one of thoſe five Propoſitions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope after diſcuſſion of all thoſe Points by the aforeſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, at which he was for the moſt part perſonally preſent; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged theſe his determinations thereupon, and affixed theſe diſtinct Notes, and Cenſures to every Propoſition; which we have thought fit to deliver in <hi>Latin</hi> in ſuch manner, as they are ſet down by <hi>Ciacconius: in vitâ Innocentii</hi> X.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:50681:386"/>Towards the end of this Pope's Reign <hi>Francis Piccolomini</hi> General of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Order ſignified to <hi>Innocent</hi> the intentions of <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> to relinquiſh her Kingdom, and embrace the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Faith, which that ſhe might profeſs in greater liberty, and more to her Chriſtian Edification, ſhe reſolved to make the Holy City of <hi>Rome</hi> the place of her habitation, where ſhe reſolved to ſpend the remainder of her days. This news was received with great joy at <hi>Rome,</hi> but more eſpecially by the Pope, who finding his ſtrength decaying and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was much troubled, that his life would not laſt until he could ſee the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and a general peace reſtored amongſt Chriſtian Princes.</p>
               <p>This Pope at ten promotions created thirty nine Cardinals accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Livello,</hi> but <hi>Ciconius</hi> enumerates forty; of which two of them were afterwards Popes; namely <hi>Fabio Ghigi,</hi> who was <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. and <hi>Benedetto Odeſcalchi,</hi> who is <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. now at preſent reigning.</p>
               <p>After the month of <hi>September</hi> 1654. the Pope began to decline paſt all hopes of recovery; and though he were nurſed by <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> with all tenderneſs and care, yet old age was ſuch an incurable Diſeaſe, that there was no Herb, or Medicine in Nature to cure it: and yet this good Lady did what ſhe could to prolong his life, ſhe kept him from the diſturbances of Buſineſs, not admitting any Perſon to diſcourſe at his Bed-ſide, unleſs in her preſence, and then ſhe would mind them of the Pope's weakneſs, and interrupt Ambaſſadours in the midſt of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, deſiring them to defer their Buſineſs until a time that he might be in a more ſtrong and able diſpoſition of health. It is ſaid, that the Pope continued ten days without any uſe of Reaſon, in which time <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> got at leaſt half a Million; for ſhe made uſe of her time ſetting every thing at low and mean Rates, ſo that ſhe did not want Chapmen for all vacant Benefices, and Eccleſiaſtical preferments. At length on the 7th. of <hi>January</hi> 1655. <hi>Innocent</hi> died at his Palace of <hi>Monte Cavallo,</hi> which is <hi>Mons Quirinalis,</hi> after he had governed ten years, and three months and twenty three days, being aged eighty years and eight months. His Body was interred for ſome time in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, but was afterwards removed by Prince <hi>Pamfilio</hi> to the Church of St. <hi>Agnes,</hi> where he erected a ſtately Monument in memory of his Uncle <hi>Innocent</hi> X.</p>
               <p>The death of the Pope was no ſooner divulged through the City, but all People began to rejoice; the Cardinals were pleaſed in expectation and hope of their own promotions: the Clergy were pleaſed becauſe the Church was freed from the Simony, and ſcandal of <hi>Donna Olympia</hi>; and the Commonalty rejoiced for the enjoyment of that liberty, which is commonly indulged at the vacancy of the Sea; and every one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> would be torn in pieces by the multitude, who had long ſince threatned her, being the perſon whom they perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hated. Howſoever nothing happened, for as they ſay in Rome, <hi>When the Dog is dead, all the malice dies with him.</hi> And ſo it fared with <hi>Donna Olympia</hi>; who being allied to many great Families was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected by them, none daring to offer her any injury, leſt it ſhould be revenged by her more powerful Relations.</p>

For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the uſual factions of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> there aroſe a third, called <hi>the Flying Squadron,</hi> which conſiſted of the new Colledg of ſuch Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals as had been created by <hi>Innocent</hi> X. and conſequently the friends of <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> who reſolved if poſſible to continue an Oar in the Boat of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſtickled very hard to have the Election fall on ſome of the new Colledg, under whom ſhe hoped to find good quarter, and to enjoy the ill-gotten Goods, and Riches ſhe had amaſſed by Simony, and other Villanies; to effect this, and to manage this Party to beſt advantage, ſhe propoſed to put this <hi>Flying Squadron</hi> under one Head, which ſhe nominated to be <hi>John Carlo de Medicis,</hi> who for his Noble Birth and Seniority, having been the firſt Cardinal that was created by the late Pope, might deſerve to be the Chief Directour of that Intereſt; but the <hi>Squadron</hi> refuſed that formality, ſaying, <hi>That each of them had a Head of his own, and feet to walk upon</hi>; nor would <hi>Maldachini,</hi> who was Nephew to <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> be perſuaded into this Combination; but rather declared himſelf openly to be her Enemy; howſoever his Power was little in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> though he made more noiſe than all the reſt, which his Aunt termed <hi>the braying of an Aſs, whoſe Voice never reached to Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To prolong the length of this <hi>Conclave,</hi> there were twenty two Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, moſt of them having conſiderable Intereſt, and all of them high expectations. The wiſe and antient Cardinals, ſuch as <hi>Sachetti, Barberino,</hi> and <hi>Chigi,</hi> reſolved to ſuffer the fury of the <hi>Conclave</hi> to vent it ſelf, by divers Excluſions, before they were offered to the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny. So <hi>Maculano</hi> and <hi>Palotta</hi> otherwiſe called Cardinal of St. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was excluded, with <hi>Gualtieri, Cherubino, Corrado,</hi> and others: At length <hi>Sachetti</hi> was nominated, but was excluded by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Party, who for the ſake of the <hi>Conde Duca Olivarez,</hi> with whom he had maintained a quarrel ever ſince the time he had been Nuntio in <hi>Spain,</hi> bore a perfect hatred to him: and though by means of the <hi>Flying Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron</hi> thirty three Voices appeared for him, yet <hi>Spain</hi> was ſtronger, by
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:50681:387"/>
the addition of other Cardinals to the <hi>Conclave,</hi> namely the Arch biſhops of <hi>Naples, Prague, Genoua,</hi> and others, all which were united to the intereſt of <hi>Spain:</hi> Cardinal <hi>Barberino</hi> was the next that was put to the Scrutiny, in favour of whom appeared ſo great a number, as affrighted Cardinal <hi>de Medices</hi> the inveterate Enemy of that Family. It was once alledged againſt him, that his Uncle had been lately Pope, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it was ſcarce practicable to have the triple Crown planted on the head of the Uncle, and ſo ſoon after on the head of the Nephew: for though <hi>Paul</hi> II. ſucceeded his Uncle <hi>Eugenius</hi> VI. yet it was after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intermediate ſucceſſions of other Popes, in like manner <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. ſucceeded <hi>Calixtus</hi> III. ſo did <hi>Pius</hi> III. to <hi>Pius</hi> II. and <hi>Julius</hi> II. to <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. and <hi>Clement</hi> VII. to <hi>Leo</hi> X. But for <hi>Barberino</hi> to ſucceed ſo ſoon after to his Uncle <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. only with the interpoſition of one ſingle Pope, would have been an action without Example, and unknown to former Ages. At length the Cardinals weary of a three months impriſonment, reſolved to come to a concluſion; and the rather becauſe that the People would not longer endure to be without a Governour: there having been ſuch Villanies committed during the vacancy of the Sea, that none deſired the prolongation thereof, but diſſolute Perſons, whileſt Men of honeſty, and ſubſtance lived in danger, and without protection: wherefore, I ſay, they were reſolved to make an end by the Election of one, who ſhould be grateful and acceptable to all Parties, and this was <hi>Fabio Chigi,</hi> who afterwards called himſelf by the name of <hi>Alexander</hi> VII.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Chigi</hi> was one of the new Colledg, being created Cardinal by <hi>Innocent</hi> X. and therefore it was not probable that he would prove an Enemy to the Houſe of <hi>Pamfilio,</hi> nor conſequently to <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> if he were endued with a Soul inclined to gratitude. On the other ſide, the Enemies to that Lady, were ſo well aſſured of the juſtice, zeal and vertue of <hi>Chigi,</hi> that he would never ſuffer ſuch Scandals and Villanies offered to the Church to remain unpuniſhed, that they could not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend he would ever favour the cauſe of that Woman. The <hi>Medici</hi> fearing leſt <hi>Sachetti</hi> ſhould at laſt be elected, concurred in <hi>Chigi.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> always eſteemed him of their Party, and partial to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; <hi>Barberino</hi> likewiſe deſirous to do ſomething which might put a Complement, or an Obligation on <hi>Spain</hi> concurred with the others: the only difficulty was that of <hi>France,</hi> to overcome which, Cardinal <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi> who was extreamly active in this Election undertook to deal with <hi>Sachetti,</hi> who was one of the Leaders of the <hi>French</hi> Party, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to a concurrence: in management of which, he highly exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Wiſdom, Religion, and Vertue of <hi>Chigi,</hi> to be in every reſpect qualified for this eminent Dignity; that being every way fitted to do ſervice to God and his Church, it would be a blemiſh to Religion, and the Catholick profeſſion to have ſuch a Perſon laid aſide, from a mere punctilio of diſtaſt, or unreaſonable dis-ſatisfaction: With theſe and ſuch like Arguments he prevailed with <hi>Sachetti</hi> to write a Letter to Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> to encline him to a good Opinion and eſteem of <hi>Chigi</hi>; whom <hi>Sachetti</hi> repreſented ſo effectually, that <hi>Mazarine</hi> gave his aſſent, and approbation. So that all difficulties being overcome, <hi>Chigi</hi> was with the common Votes of the whole <hi>Conclave</hi> elected on the 7th. of <hi>April</hi> 1655. in which they were ſo unanimous that there was not one diſſenting Voice found in the Scrutiny, which ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens;
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:50681:388"/>
and <hi>Roſetti</hi> himſelf, who once ſwore, that he would cut his hand off before it ſhould contribute to <hi>Ghigi</hi>'s Election, gave his Vote alſo in the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fabius Chigi</hi> was born at <hi>Siena</hi> in the year 1599. his Father <hi>Flavio Ghigi,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Laura Marſilia</hi> both of <hi>Patrician</hi> Families, but by misfortunes of the World and other accidents were much declined from their antient ſplendour: his Father dying when he was young, his education was committed to his Mother, who took care to have him inſtructed by the beſt Maſters in Grammar, Philoſophy, Divinity and ſtudies of the Civil Law. Being arrived at the age of eighteen years, his Brother <hi>Auguſtine</hi> perſuaded him to try his fortune in <hi>Rome,</hi> which is commonly the place which raiſes Men of parts and induſtry to higheſt preferments: his Eſtate was indeed very low and mean, the Patrimony of his Father being divided amongſt a numerous iſſue of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Siſters: wherefore to help his fortune <hi>Auguſtino</hi> procured him Letters of recommendation to Marquis <hi>Sfortia Pallavicinio,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great Wit and Parts, then living at <hi>Rome,</hi> who diſcovering more than ordinary ingenuity, and vertue in <hi>Chigi,</hi> introduced him to acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Pope <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. who ſoon took a great liking to him for his faculty in Poeſie, and particularly for being an Admirer of <hi>Horace</hi>; in imitation of whom he compoſed many Odes, which were extreamly delightful to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> who himſelf was an excellent Poet, and in his youthful days had wrote many Poems with much Elegancy. By theſe means <hi>Chigi</hi> became a chief Favourite of the Pope, who diſcovering in him a mind capable of higher matters than a ſtrain of Poeſie, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him with much affection to his Nephew <hi>Franciſco Barberino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chigi</hi> being of a gentle and tractable diſpoſition, and extreamly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, comported himſelf towards <hi>Barberino</hi> with a behaviour free from affectation and flattery; and yet in ſuch a ſincere and pleaſing manner, that <hi>Barberino</hi> preferred him to the Charge and Office of Inquiſitor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, in which capacity he was ſent to <hi>Malta,</hi> where he ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf to the ſatisfaction of thoſe Knights, that having finiſhed the time allotted him by his Commiſſion; he returned to <hi>Rome</hi> with Letters, and teſtimonials from the Grand Maſter applauding his actions, and comportment during the whole time of his reſidence; and with this particular character, <hi>That</hi> Malta <hi>had never before been made happy with any Perſon equal to him in merit.</hi> And having given this firſt Eſſay of his abilities, the Pope conſtituted him his Vice-Legat in <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where he alſo ſo well demeaned himſelf, that in the ſpace of three years, there was not any who complained againſt his juſtice; but was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all for a juſt, and an impartial Judg.</p>
               <p>Being returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> it was not long before he was diſpatched to <hi>Cologn</hi> in quality of Nuntio: which employment may ſerve for an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof of the great eſteem which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> conceived of him; when in that conjuncture of affairs, all the World being diſunited and at variance, there required a Miniſter of more than ordinary conduct, and dexterity to manage the difficulty of Treaties then in action; for having to deal between the Catholicks, and Proteſtants, he could not act with due Equity towards the latter, without giving ſcandal to the former, and granting that which was detrimental, and derogatory to the Power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And though the Negotiations of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:50681:388"/>
                  <hi>Chigi</hi> for the Intereſt, and in favour of his Maſter the Pope were ſuch, as rather obſtructed than forwarded the concluſion of the Treaty; yet the Emperour and King of <hi>Spain, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> growing weary with the troubles of a bloudy War, agreed of themſelves without being obliged to the Pope for his Offices of Mediation: for on the contrary the Articles agreed were ſo detrimental to the Eccleſiaſtical State; that the Pope was ſo far from having a hand in the making of them, that he wholly diſowned and proteſted againſt them, by his Nuntio <hi>Ghigi</hi>; who in that dexterous, and diſcreet manner ſo well repreſented his Maſter's complaints to the Imperial and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, that they could not but allow the reſentments of the Pope to be juſt for which they had no excuſe, but the unhappy ſtate, and urgency of their affairs: but as to the perſon of <hi>Ghigi,</hi> and his conduct, every one remained ſatisfied, giving him the character of a prudent, wiſe, and an able Miniſter.</p>
               <p>Theſe Negotiations at <hi>Cologne</hi> rendered him more capable to ſerve the Papal Intereſt at <hi>Munſter,</hi> in quality of the Pope's Legat, in which he behaved himſelf with ſuch equality of mind and good temper towards the Proteſtants without offence to the oppoſite party, that with general ſatisfaction he acquitted himſelf in this great charge: all which being obſerved and known to <hi>Innocent</hi> X. he was in reward of his many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices promoted to the degree of Cardinal; and afterwards was made Secretary in the place of Cardinal <hi>Panzirolo</hi> deceaſed, a perſon of that judgment, and quickneſs of parts fit for buſineſs; that his equal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was not again to be found in any part of the World. And yet <hi>Ghigi</hi> pleaſed the Pope as well, or perhaps better than <hi>Panzirolo</hi>; for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> being on his death-bed, where Men commonly put off all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes of diſſimulation, declared, that of all the Cardinals, there was none more fit to ſucceed him, than <hi>Chigi.</hi> Howſoever in the <hi>Conclave</hi> there was ſcarce any task, or diſcourſe of <hi>Chigi</hi> for the firſt three months; until at length being named, the whole Colledg concurred with unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Votes in his Election; the news of which was received in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> with extraordinary joy and ſatisfaction of the People.</p>
               <p>The firſt ten days after his promotion he ſpent in ordering the ſtate of his publick and private Affairs, giving Audience to Ambaſſadours, and receiving Viſits, and Complements from Cardinals and Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: And on the 18th. of <hi>April</hi> he was Crowned after the manner of other Popes, in the great <hi>Portico</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church; after which Ceremony was ended he was publickly heard to uſe this ſaying, <hi>Vivo Ego, jam non Ego, vivit verò in me Chriſtus:</hi> I live, but not I, but Chriſt who liveth in me, which was the Motto he commonly inſcribed over the Chambers of his private retirements.</p>
               <p>In the next place, he wrote his Letters to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> acquainting them with his promotion to the Apoſtolical Chair; and having given them the paternal Benediction, he perſuaded them to Peace, and Concord amongſt themſelves, and ſo turn their Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> for aſſiſtance of the <hi>Venetians</hi> who were a match une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to contend with ſo mighty an Emperour.</p>
               <p>But before we proceed farther, it is to be expected that we ſhould make an end of the Story of <hi>Donna Olympia,</hi> who remained all this while between hope, and fear, in what manner <hi>Alexander</hi> would deal with her. Prince <hi>Pamfilio</hi> was one of the firſt who went to congratulate
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:50681:389"/>
with him: and her Ladyſhip that ſhe might not be the laſt, to expreſs her joy, ſent her <hi>Maggiordomo</hi> or Steward to pay her Reſpects, declaring the great joy ſhe conceived to ſee one created Pope, to whom her Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had opened the way by making him Cardinal, and her joys were conſummate, in that ſhe had always repreſented him to <hi>Innocent</hi> as a Perſon of extraordinary Abilities, ſo that ſhe could not but ſhare with him in the advance of his fortunes. The Pope anſwered little and in ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous terms; ſo that to diſcover his more deep, and real thoughts, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> was employed, who making great profeſſions in her behalf endeavoured to draw from the Pope ſomething of his intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her. But <hi>Alexander</hi> who profeſſed always to do things leiſurely, was not very open in declaring himſelf, which gave <hi>Olympia</hi> the firſt occaſion of diſtruſt: and indeed ſhe had very much reaſon, for every day made new diſcoveries of the corruptions and abuſes ſhe had exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed both in Civil, and Eccleſiaſtical matters. The Datary was wholly corrupted by the Simonies ſhe had introduced, all Places ſold, no Treaſure left, beſides a thouſand other Villanies, and miſchiefs ſhe had committed.</p>
               <p>There was not a day paſſed, but the Pope had his hands filled with Memorials againſt her; ſo that his zeal for the Church could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcandal fit ſtill, and let ſlip ſuch horrid Crimes without Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>At the report hereof the Lady trembling with fear ſent Cardinal <hi>Barberino</hi> to diſcourſe the Pope before matters were gone too far: but the Pope was too zealous, and wife to hearken to any ſmooth and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Speeches in her behalf: and therefore poſitive in his reſolutions ſent his expreſs Commands to <hi>Olympia</hi> to leave <hi>Rome</hi> in three days, and in eight to be at <hi>Orvieto,</hi> which is a City about thirty miles diſtant from <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence ſhe was not to remove without new Orders from the Pope. There was no oppoſing theſe poſitive Commands, which were neither to be queſtioned nor delayed; ſo that her Ladyſhip privately departed the City, for fear of being affronted by the Rabble, who every where made Songs, and Jeſts of her; the ſame day that her Ladyſhip quitted <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope began to take the examination of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for drawing up the Proceſs, but the work was too tedious to be ſpeedily finiſhed; for ſo many ſeveral Charges, and Impeachments came daily againſt her that there was no end, nor could the Books be ſhut up though ſwelled to incredible Volumes. Wherefore to make ſhort work, the Pope commanded ten of the moſt material Points to be filed againſt her, to which ſhe was in the firſt place to give anſwer, before a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Charge was to be formed: and in the mean time, it was the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Town, that the Pope reſolved to ſequeſter her Eſtate, and impriſon her Perſon.</p>
               <p>But whilſt Affairs went on in this manner a dreadful Viſitation of Peſtilence in the year 1656. fell upon <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſo afflicted the City, that not onely Trade and Commerce was interrupted, but the common Courts of Juſtice were ſhut up, ſo that the farther proſecution of <hi>Donna Olympia</hi> ceaſed: but the Juſtice of God took up the Cauſe againſt her, and the divine Vengeance reached this guilty Wretch by a ſtroak of the Plague, of which ſhe died at <hi>Orvieto</hi> ſome few months after her perſecution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:50681:389"/>It was computed that ſhe left more than two millions of Crowns in ready Money, beſides Land, and moveables ineſtimable, and what ſhe had already beſtowed on her kinred. After her death there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more done, and not much more talk'd of her, for the Prince <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filio</hi> as Heir to her Eſtate quietly poſſeſſed himſelf of all, taking his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in her Palace in the <hi>Piazza</hi> of <hi>Navona,</hi> which is the faireſt in all <hi>Rome:</hi> onely it is ſaid, ſhe left ſome few Legacies amongſt her other kindred, which did not exceed three hundred thouſand Crowns.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Alexander</hi> came firſt to the Papal Chair he publickly declared againſt <hi>Nepotiſm,</hi> and with ſome direful aſſeverations that he would never rule by his Kinred, nor enrich his Family with the ſpoils of the Church: whilſt he continued in this humour he proſecuted <hi>Donna O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympia</hi> with as much ſeverity and rigour, as the methods, and courſe of Law would allow; ſo that after her death, it was believed, he would have confiſcated all her Eſtate to the uſe of St. <hi>Peter:</hi> but it ſeems, the deteſtation of her Crimes, and his anger for all her evils, died, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with her perſon; only 'tis ſaid, that he drew away about a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Crowns from Prince <hi>Pamfilio</hi> her Heir, to beſtow on his own Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred (robbing <hi>Peter,</hi> as we ſay, to pay <hi>Paul</hi>)</p>
               <p>But this ſturdy humour againſt his Kindred continued not long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſuffered himſelf to be overcome by the yerning of his own bowels towards them, and by the perſuaſion of ſome Cardinals his Confidents, who obſerving a deſire in him to break his late proteſtation met his wiſhes with their arguments of love towards his own Bloud, and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for why ſhould he be ſingular, and leſs kind to himſelf, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily than other Popes? or why ſhould the Houſe of <hi>Chigi</hi> remain onely obſcure, and mean? whileſt the <hi>Barberini,</hi> and <hi>Pamfilii</hi> were opulent, and exalted, and all the Princes of <hi>Rome</hi> derived their Riches, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the favour and benefice of Popes, who had been their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations melted the tender heart of <hi>Alexander</hi> in ſuch manner, that towards the end of the firſt year of his Pontificate, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Brother <hi>Don Mario</hi> with his Son <hi>Flavio,</hi> and <hi>Don Auguſtino</hi> the Son of his Brother <hi>Auguſto,</hi> unto the Court; and being now provided with a Brother, and two Nephews he uſed them with as much indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as other Popes had ſhewn to their kindred; giving the World to underſtand, how little Men are acquainted with their own hearts, and how eaſily they change their reſolutions, and affections with the alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their fortunes, and encreaſe of their honours: but leſt it ſhould ſeem ſtrange to the World, that after ſuch ſolemn proteſtations againſt <hi>Nepotiſm,</hi> he ſhould without other methods introduce his Nephews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Offices, and the principal benefits, and profits of the Church, he with much formality in a publick Conſiſtory demanded the Opinion of the Cardinals, whether the admittance of ſuch faithful friends, as his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Nephews might not rather be uſeful, than detrimental to the Church? The Cardinals who are always civil to the Pope and ready to concur with his deſires; every one entertaning an expectancy of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pope himſelf, when it might be his own caſe and might feel the like warm inclinations towards his own bloud; would not be ſo rude as to exclude his Family from their ſhare in the Government; but rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him to indulg his own Family, and be as kind to his, as his
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:50681:390"/>
Predeceſſours had been to their Relations: and leſt the World ſhould by this admittance of a new <hi>Nepotiſm,</hi> imagine, or ſuſpect that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the Church ſhould be employed to the raiſing of the Family of <hi>Chigi,</hi> and that the times of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. and <hi>Innocent</hi> X. were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; he ordered Briefs to be iſſued againſt Simony, and other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions with more ſevere terms, and under other more execrable male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions than had formerly been uſed: He renewed alſo antient Decrees againſt Penſions and Gifts: and farther Ordained, that ſeveral vacant Benefices ſhould not be ſupplied, but that the Revenue of them being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Apoſtolical Chamber, ſhould be employed towards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing the vaſt Debts of the Church.</p>
               <p>And that he might farther engage, and inſinuate himſelf into the minds and good will of the People, who conceived high thoughts of him, and demonſtrated unuſual expreſſions of joy at the beginning of his Inauguration; he exerciſed his paternal Love, and Charity towards them in three ſeveral calamities which befel the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and followed one, as it were, on the neck of the other.</p>
               <p>In the year 1656. the City (as we have ſaid) was viſited with ſuch a raging Peſtilence, which continued for two years, as rendered it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſolate; during which time the Famine had been as deſtructive, and made an end of thoſe which the Plague had left, had not the Poor been relieved and comforted by the generous care, and pious charity of this Pope. No ſooner was the Peſtilence ceaſed, but the <hi>Tyber</hi> ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with inordinate Rains, ſurpaſſed its banks with ſuch a deluge, as drowned all the <hi>Campagne,</hi> and lower Villages of <hi>Rome:</hi> but thoſe which were ſeated on higher elevations of Hills, were environed ſo with the Waters on all ſides, that for the ſpace of fifteen days, they could have no communication with their Neighbours for relief, and ſuſtenance; onely the Pope taking compaſſion on his People, employed great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of flat-bottomed Boats, laden with Proviſions to paſs from one Village to another, for the ſuccour, and ſuſtenance of the Inhabitants; after which, he took all the courſes, and expedients poſſible to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the price of Wheat, that the People might be ſupported, and not die with Famine.

               <p>Soon after the enſtalment of Pope <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Chriſtian Princes ſent their reſpective Ambaſſadours to <hi>Rome</hi> after the uſual cuſtom, to pay (as they call it) their Acts of Obedience, and homage to the Pope.

his onely fault was, that he was haughty, and of an humour ſo fierce, as became a Camp better than the more polite, and gentle comportments of an <hi>Italian</hi> Court, or the converſation of Eccleſiaſtical Perſons.</p>
               <p>Howſoever, his deportment was pleaſing enough to the Pope and Cardinals, ſo long as <hi>Don Mario</hi> and the Nephews comported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (as they did at firſt) within the limits of ſome reaſonable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty; but ſo ſoon as they began to paſs thoſe terms, and become inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, this Ambaſſadour could not long ſuſtain their pride, before their reſentments broke forth into outragious violences: as we ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to diſcourſe when we come to the year 1662.</p>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 1657.</note> the <hi>Venetians</hi> were hardly preſſed by the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Power of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms; and being unable by their own force to wage a War againſt that potent Enemy; the Senate omitted no appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, or addreſſes to perſuade forein Princes to yield them ſuccour either by Men, or Money. But Wars raging in all parts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom adminiſtred trouble, and care ſufficient for every Prince to conſult and provide for his own affairs and ſafety. The <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> to whom the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſent their Ambaſſadour, promiſed fair, and gave good words, but with little other effect; it being difficult to concert matters, or engage affections, or reconcile the Intereſt of Princes ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote. Thus the <hi>Venetians</hi> becoming deſtitute of all ſuccours from forein Powers, addreſſed themſelves to the Pope, as their ultimate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in all their diſtreſſes, beſeeching his Holineſs to grant them ſuch ſums of Mony as might ſupply their preſent occaſions. But alas, <hi>Rome</hi> being but newly recovered from a languiſhing ſtate of Peſtilence and from other calamities before mentioned, during which immenſe ſums had been iſſued from the publick Treaſury to ſuſtain the Commonalty in their ſcarcity and want; the Pope alledged juſt Cauſes to excuſe the disburſment of Money from his Treaſury, which had of late years been miſerably exhauſted by the Avarice of thoſe who had had the management of it: Howſoever though the Pope pretended himſelf not able to iſſue out Money from his own Exchequer; yet he hearkened to ſome Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals and expedients for raiſing it, by the ſale of certain Lands, and Rents belonging to the two Orders of the <hi>Crociferi,</hi> and of the <hi>Santo Spirito</hi>; which the Pope's Authority, and the cauſe for which they were ſold, being for maintenance of a War againſt Infidels, and of the Chriſtian Cauſe againſt <hi>Turks</hi>; was ſufficient to warrant and hallow the ſale, and give a lawful Title to any Purchaſer. The Order of the <hi>Crociferi</hi> was very ancient, and poſſeſſed ſeveral Monaſteries diſperſed in all parts of <hi>Italy</hi>; but that of the <hi>Spirito Santo</hi> conſiſted of three Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries onely, and all within the Dominion of the Republick, by which they had been endowed under the protection and government of the Council of Ten: howſoever the deſolation of theſe Monaſteries could not paſs without the ſevere Cenſures and reflections of the World: and though the Friers of thoſe Orders were much fallen from the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of their antient inſtitution, and become corrupt and debauched in their lives, and manners, yet their clamours could not be ſuppreſſed, nor the calumnies which they daily uttered againſt the Pope, and the Republick be quieted. Howſoever a Bull being paſſed, and a Decree of the Senate for ſale of the Lands, together with thoſe of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſmaller Monaſteries; the Pope's Nuntio with three Senators were commiſſionated to ſell, and paſs the Title to the Purchaſers, whereby the Senate raiſed above a million of Ducats, which were all employed to carry forward a War againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi> Whileſt this good correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence paſſed between the Pope and the Republick, and that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had daily need of ſuccours, and aſſiſtances from the Church; it was thought a convenient ſeaſon in the heat of theſe Negotiations, for the Pope to propoſe the reſtoration of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> to their poſſeſſions on the Dominions of <hi>Venice,</hi> from whence they had been baniſhed on occaſion of the differences between <hi>Paul</hi> V. and the <hi>Venetians.

deſires herein at a full Senate, laying before them the conveniences they might expect, and benefits they might reap, by cloſing with the Pope's demands in this Caſe, which ſeemed to be much changed, ſince the firſt Original Decree, and bando againſt them; for that thoſe <hi>Jeſuits</hi> who had fomented the diviſions, and Sedition were already dead; and that thoſe who were to ſupply their places would be more cautious, and careful for the future in what manner they incurred the diſpleaſure of the Republick: theſe conſiderations being ſeconded by warm inſtances of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour to the ſame purpoſe, the matter was carried in the Senate for reſtoration of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and though the antient Decrees of the Senate in this caſe were poſitive, and rigorous to the contrary, and that Cavalier <hi>Soranzo</hi> greatly oppoſed the admiſſion; yet the preſſure of Affairs, and the neceſſity of gratifying the Pope was ſuch, that the former Decrees were repealed, and the Laws againſt the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> made void; and in this manner and on this occaſion in the year 1657. they again reſtored to their poſſeſſions within the <hi>Venetian</hi> Dominions, the Church of the <hi>Crociferi</hi> being conferred upon them in the City of <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Court of <hi>Rome</hi> being gratified by this conceſſion; not onely the Pope, but the Cardinals alſo concurred in their liberal contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions towards maintenance of the War againſt the <hi>Turk</hi>: of which five eſpecially were ſignally bountiful, and munificent above the others; namely, <hi>Antonio Barberino,</hi> who gave one hundred thouſand Ducats in Gold; Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> gave two hundred thouſand; <hi>Franciſco Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berino,</hi> and <hi>Flavio Ghigi</hi> agreed to maintain three Gallies at their own expence; and laſtly Cardinal <hi>Nicholas</hi> who was a Count of the Bath, not having ſufficient Eſtate in ready Money to make ſuch a contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he deſired, ſold his Palace and Houſhold-ſtuff, and Vineyards, that he might be regiſtred amongſt the Benefactors to this War.</p>
               <p>At this time alſo the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms prevailed againſt the Emperour in the upper parts of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſo that <hi>Varadin</hi> was taken, and the <hi>Turks</hi> became very formidable: Wherefore that Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> might not ſeem leſs ſollicitous for conſervation of the Emperour than he was for the <hi>Venetians</hi>; he iſſued conſiderable ſums out of his Treaſury, and laid a Decimation on the Revenue of the Clergy over all <hi>Italy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to aſſiſt the Imperial Arms: and farther wrote Letters to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> then buſily employed in a Treaty at the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans,</hi> that having concluded a Peace amongſt themſelves, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſtrengthned the Alliance by the ties, and Obligations of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they would have reſpect to the Wars in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which were carried on by the <hi>Turk</hi> to the deſtruction, and ruin of the Chriſtian Cauſe.</p>
               <p>But we are not here to omit, that this Treaty of the <hi>Pyreneans</hi> which was held in the Iſland of <hi>Pheaſants,</hi> where the Marriage was concluded between the preſent King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. and <hi>Maria Tereſa Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> was acted and carried on between Cardinal <hi>Mazarini,</hi> and <hi>Don Luis d' Haro,</hi> without the mediation and concurrence of this Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>: which ſeems the more ſtrange, in regard that this very Pope was Nuntio at <hi>Munſter,</hi> and once managed that Treaty there in behalf of <hi>Innocent</hi> X. with great applauſe, and proof of his abilities and integrity, and was perſonally known to the Cardinal; many therefore and various were
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:50681:392"/>
the reflections on this Point by the Politicians of thoſe times; and many Writers on this Subject have aſſigned divers Cauſes, and reaſons for it. Some would have it, that during the time that Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> and the Pope, then in quality of Nuntio were together in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſeveral differences had ariſen between them, not then reconciled; and that the Nuntio had always ſhewn ſome partiality towards the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>; for which cauſe <hi>Mazarine</hi> had oppoſed the election of him to be Pope; and though afterwards he had been ſweetned by the character, and commendations which <hi>Sachetti</hi> had given of him; yet ſtill ſome acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remained on the ſpirits of the Pope, becauſe he obſerved an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Cardinal to treat the Peace in any part, where the Pope did reſide; he alſo obſerved with what indignity to the Papal Sea he had treated the Cardinal of <hi>Retz:</hi> and with what neglect, and almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt he comported himſelf towards his Nuntio at <hi>Paris.</hi> Moreover, the Pope was not a little diſpleaſed to obſerve what backwardneſs, and delay was uſed by the Court of <hi>France,</hi> no onely in ſending the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Embaſſy of Obedience to <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Ordinary alſo of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency; nor was the Pope ignorant of thoſe ſlight, and contemptible expreſſions, which both the Cardinal, and his Favourite the Biſhop of <hi>Omodei</hi> publickly uttered with ill reflections on his Perſon. On the other ſide the Cardinal complained of the Pope's Ingratitude; for that after he had ſo freely concurred in his Election, he always evidenced an averſneſs to comply with him in the moſt reaſonable Demands, and ever favoured that Party which interfered with the Intereſt of <hi>France</hi>; ſo that the Cardinal would often ſay, that the Pope offered him frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injuries, that ſo, if at any time, he did him right, it might ſeem to proceed from favour rather than from the motives of Juſtice. Theſe matters, and the like occaſioning coldneſs of correſpondence, it is no wonder, that Writers ſhould attribute the reaſon of the Pope's excluſion from this Treaty of Peace to the preceding Cauſes; Whenas the moſt reaſonable Obſtacle might be, the Pope's incapacity to moderate, and concur in the terms of this Peace: for whereas the foundation of this Peace between the two Crowns, was eſtabliſhed on the Articles conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and agreed at the Treaty of <hi>Munſter</hi>; which the Pope having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, diſanulled, and proteſted againſt, it could not be expected, that the Pope ſhould be called, and made a Party to that Treaty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had reſolved to raiſe difficulties, by that oppoſition, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which would have been made by the Pope, and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the Marriage being celebrated between the moſt Chriſtian King; and the <hi>Infanta Maria Tereſa,</hi> the onely cauſe, and Object of the Peace; was afterwards the original of many quarrels, and diſorders in Chriſtendom. For the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not having been ſo ſtrict, and wary as the importance of the matter required, did not take care to pen the Inſtrument of <hi>Renuntiation</hi> which the <hi>Infanta</hi> ſigned to the Dominions of her Father, and all her Paternal Inheritance with ſuch ſtrict terms, but that there was ſtill a Gate open to pretenſions: nor was the form of the Oath ſo ſtrict, and expreſſive, but that there was place left for evaſions, as the ambition of Men, and their deſire of Dominion ſhould govern and tranſport them; from whence great confuſions, and bloudy Wars have ariſen, as the Annals of our times are able to atteſt.</p>

And not content with this outrage put themſelves into a Body, and in Military order with their Colours flying, and Drums beating, came and preſented themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain before the Palace <hi>Farneſe</hi>; on which appearance the Ambaſſadour cauſed the Gates to be ſhut: During this tumult, it happened that the Lady Ambaſſadreſs returned home, whom when the <hi>Corſi</hi> eſpied, theſe barbarous beaſts fired a Volley of ſhot into her Coach, and killed a Page, who attended at the Boot; with which unexpected accident the Lady being affrighted, fled for refuge into the Palace of Cardinal <hi>d' Eſte</hi>; who ſoon afterwards, with a Guard of two hundred Men convoyed her ſafe to the Duke her Husband, though Cardinal <hi>Imperiale</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had ordered the Captain of the <hi>Corſi</hi> to obſtruct the paſſage of Cardinal <hi>d' Eſte</hi>; but when this Cardinal ſent <hi>Imperiale</hi> word, that he ſhould anſwer the leaſt diſorder, which ſhould happen hereupon, with the loſs of his life, he conſidered better upon it, and deſiſted from giving farther interruption.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> paſſed all the Night following in conſultation with the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Spain, Venice, Malta</hi>; and with others whom he eſteemed well affected to the Crown of <hi>France</hi>; all which agreed that the Dignity and Character of ſacred Embaſſies was wounded and violated by this outrage. On the other ſide, the Cardinal <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riale, Don Mario,</hi> and others of that faction held long conferences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the management of this Affair: for to juſtifie it, the matter was too foul, and barbarous to admit of any plea, or excuſe: and therefore it was reſolved to give it the name of a <hi>Riot,</hi> and tumult raiſed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of the Soldiery; and that all the Family of the <hi>Ghigi</hi> both Men and Women ſhould make their Viſits of Condolence to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and his Lady, expreſſing abundance of ſorrow and trouble for the late misfortune, which they ſolely attributed to the inſolence and fury of Soldiers, and not to any deſign, or premeditated Act of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders. But this Wound was too freſh, and ſore to be ſalved with a remedy of ſuch vain excuſes; conſidering that the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> were by expreſs Order left open all the Night, to afford means, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for the <hi>Corſi</hi> to retire, and make their eſcape.</p>
               <p>The news of what had paſſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> was brought to the King whilſt he was performing the Ceremonies of his Birth-day at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains</hi>; which though it diſturbed his Majeſty, and took much off from the Revels and jollity of the day; yet no ſudden reſolution was taken until ſome days after. In the mean time Letters arrived both from the
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:50681:394"/>
Pope, and the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> repreſenting the matter, as a mere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident cauſed by a ſudden, and an unreaſonable outrage of the Soldiery, for which neither the Pope, nor his Kinred, nor the Commanders could be accountable; and with this account the King began to be ſo well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that he had once thoughts to paſs it by, and ſhew no farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments of it. But whileſt this was meditating, Letters came from the Duke of <hi>Crequi,</hi> adviſing, that by reaſon of the ill treatment he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the common proviſions for the ſupport of his Houſe were in a great meaſure reſtrained; ſo that he ſhould be forced with his Family to leave <hi>Rome,</hi> and to retire into the Dominions of the Duke of <hi>Toſcany.</hi> This Advice and new matter of Affront ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the mind of the King, that he immediately commanded the Nuntio to depart his Dominions, which was executed ſo effectually, that he was conducted by a Guard to the confines of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the Pope being deſirous to excuſe, and protect Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Imperiale,</hi> was contented to take the blame upon himſelf; and to mannage the matter, he conſtituted a ſelect Congregation of Cardinals, <hi>viz. Roſpiglioſi, Chigi, Borromeo, Imperiale, Pio, Sachetti, Corrado,</hi> and <hi>Farneſe,</hi> to examine, and diſcourſe the matters in Diſpute in a Political manner, and to give their Opinions by what ways and means, things might beſt admit of an Accommodation. The Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained licence to be admitted to a Viſit with the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour: but it ſignified little, for the Ambaſſadour appeared ſullen, and reſerved; ſaying, that he had no quarrel with the <hi>Corſi,</hi> nor had he reaſon to blame them for executing onely the commands of their Maſters.</p>
               <p>On the firſt of <hi>September Crequi</hi> departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> in company with the Duke of <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> who having ſhewed ſome concernment, and partiality for the <hi>French</hi> Party, lay under the diſpleaſure and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope. So ſoon as the Ambaſſadour was gone, diſcontents ſlew yet higher than before; for it was not onely adviſed to commit Cardinal <hi>d' Eſte</hi> into the Priſon of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> but alſo to deprive both him, and <hi>Mancini</hi> of the degree and dignity of Cardinals.</p>
               <p>But howſoever, it was thought neceſſary to appeaſe the King by ſome pleaſing Lenitives, and by means which might pacifie his juſt Anger and diſpleaſure: To which end, the Pope diſpatched divers affectionate Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to him, full of ſorrow, and reſentment for the late unhappy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs: divers Propoſals were alſo diſpatched to the Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> tending to an Accommodation: and Edicts publiſhed againſt the <hi>Corſi,</hi> who were criminals in this Action, deſiring all Princes into whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions they were fled, not to allow, or grant them protection. And farther in deteſtation of this late fact, a Company of the <hi>Corſi,</hi> which were not concerned in the Riot, were disbanded, and caſhiered from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Pope.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Crequi</hi> remained at <hi>Radocofani</hi> (which is within the Dominions of the Great Duke) expecting Orders from the King in what manner he was to behave and govern himſelf: which being come with the forms of adjuſtment, and ſome private inſtructions in favour of the Dukes of <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Modena</hi>; the Abbat <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> (Nephew of the Cardinal of that name) was diſpatched to the Ambaſſadour with Inſtructions, and Propoſals: but this Treaty taking no effect, <hi>Raſponi</hi> was employed: but then the Duke propoſed two Alternatives, the one
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:50681:394"/>
was totally excluded, and the other admitted of ſo many exceptions; that <hi>Crequi</hi> deſpairing of any reconciliation, went to <hi>Luca,</hi> and thence to <hi>Ligorne,</hi> from whence paſſing into <hi>France,</hi> he added more fuel to the Fire, encreaſing the differences which were as yet too freſh, and new to be reconciled. The two Alternatives were as follow:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That <hi>Caſtro</hi> and <hi>Rociglione</hi> ſhould be reſtored to the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and the Valley of <hi>Comachio</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi>: the moſt Chriſtian King requiring no other ſatisfaction for the late injuries he received, than that he might be able to do juſtice to the two Princes his Allies and Friends, who had reſigned themſelves to his defence, and protection. And to the end that Ambaſſadours from his Majeſty and other Princes might for the future live quietly at <hi>Rome</hi> with their Families, and enjoy the priviledges and immunities which appertain to them according to the Law of Nations; no Deſign ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſed againſt them, without the conſent, and knowledg of the Sacred Colledg.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Proceſſes at Law againſt the Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> ſhould be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded; and reparations made him for all detriment done to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and diſparagement to his Honour. And that likewiſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at Law, whether Civil, or criminal againſt any Perſon on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhould ceaſe, after the twentieth of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> That all Corps of Guard after that time, and quarters of Soldiers be removed out of <hi>Rome</hi>; and after this, That the manner, how the Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into <hi>Rome,</hi> be treated, and agreed with himſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But in caſe the Pope did not judg fit to aſſent, and agree to theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals, then this Alternative was offered:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That <hi>Don Mario</hi> be baniſhed to <hi>Siena</hi> for five years. That Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Ghigi</hi> be ſent Legat into <hi>France,</hi> to make the Pope's excuſe at his firſt Audience, upon the matters which lately happened in <hi>Rome.</hi> That at his ſecond Audience, he ſhall ſupplicate his Majeſties Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don both for himſelf and his whole Family; and that the form, and circumſtances of this Addreſs, ſhall be ordered and concerted with the Ambaſſadour <hi>Crequi.</hi> That Cardinal <hi>Imperiale</hi> be degraded, and deprived of his Hat. That the Captain of the Guards be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiered, and for ever baniſhed. That a <hi>Pyramid</hi> be erected amidſt the late quarters of the <hi>Corſi</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> with an Inſcription ſpecifying the Crime for which they were baniſhed, and for which they were rendered uncapable for ever more to ſerve, or bear Arms in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe were the firſt draughts of thoſe Propoſals which <hi>France</hi> offered in order to an Accommodation; which being brought to <hi>Rome</hi> did greatly trouble the mind of the Pope, with many melancholly and diſtracted thoughts; of which he eaſed himſelf in a full Conſiſtory, complaining of the hard terms exacted from him by the King of <hi>France:</hi> For reply where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſome of the Cardinals, and particularly <hi>Azzolino,</hi> ſpake loudly againſt the Propoſals, encouraging the Pope to a fortitude of mind, and to ſtand ſtiff upon his terms, rather demanding ſatisfaction from the King, than yielding to terms derogatory to his Honour. Howſoever the Pope being ſtreightned in his thoughts, and being divided between the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions he conceived of a War againſt the Church, and the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had for his Relations, his own Honour, and the reputation of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:50681:395"/>
the Sacred Colledg, which he eſteemed wounded in the perſon of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Imperiale</hi>; he inclined rather to the ſecond Alternative, than to the firſt: and accordingly he deſigned to ſend Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> his Legat into <hi>France:</hi> and <hi>Imperiale</hi> was to be removed from his Government in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent Legat into the <hi>Marca.</hi> But becauſe this change appeared to the King rather a promotion, than a puniſhment, he was ſent to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> there to reſide, until he could contrive means to reconcile himſelf to the King: but becauſe the Brief did not denote this diſmiſſion under the term of Baniſhment, exceptions were made thereunto as diſſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous from the pleaſure of his Majeſty: but as to <hi>Don Mario</hi> the Pope ſeemed to grant whatſoever was deſired, and to ſacrifice him, and all his Relations, for the quietneſs and peace of the Church; but this was only a flouriſh, and an exceſs of words as afterwards appeared in the ſequel, when matters came to be put in execution. As to the <hi>Corſi,</hi> whatſoever was demanded, was condeſcended unto.</p>
               <p>But things being in this imperfect manner agreed; this year ended with fears, and apprehenſions of an enſuing War. And in the mean time <hi>Avignon</hi> revolting from the Pope, the Inhabitants pulled down the Arms of the Church, and expelled the Papal Officers from the City: the People crying aloud for <hi>France,</hi> and their return to that Dominion, from whence they had been unjuſtly alienated by connivance, or indulgence of former Kings: and now they erected the Arms of <hi>France</hi> in all publick places; and reſtored, or renewed the Antient Inſcriptions, which vindicated, and atteſted the Right which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> held unto that City.</p>
               <p>To augment all theſe difficulties, <hi>Spain</hi> ſeemed inclining to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of <hi>France</hi>; for which reaſon the <hi>Venetians</hi> appeared the moſt proper Inſtruments to be employed in the Offices of Mediation; and accordingly the Ambaſſadour of that Republick reſiding at <hi>Paris</hi> called <hi>Luigi Grimani</hi> received Inſtructions to treat in favour of the Pope; and indeed the way of Treaty was the onely remedy which <hi>Rome</hi> could propoſe; for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the great admiration of the World, had granted leave for the <hi>French</hi> Troops to march through <hi>Milan</hi> into the Eccleſiaſtical State. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> adhered to the <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; <hi>Genoua</hi> being weak, and unable to reſiſt, durſt not deny a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance; the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Modena</hi> for their own convenience, and hopes of benefit, became parties in combination againſt the Pope. So that <hi>France</hi> nouriſhing vaſt Deſigns by this conjuncture of Affairs, kept up their disſatisfactions in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they pretended to have been augmented, and enflamed by that honourable treatment and reception, which the Pope had given to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Loraine,</hi> who was fled from <hi>France,</hi> and ſhrouded himſelf under the protection of the Church.</p>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 1663.</note>About the beginning of this year Cardinal <hi>d' Eſte,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> where they gave a full relation of all matters which had lately paſſed in that Outrage, committed by the <hi>Corſi</hi>; with all the particulars of the Treaty which had been acted at St. <hi>Quirico:</hi> But they repreſented things in ſuch ſevere terms, as greatly exaſperated the mind of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>: ſo that nothing was now diſcourſed of at <hi>Paris</hi> but War,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:50681:395"/>
and the manner how to carry, and manage the <hi>French</hi> Arms in <hi>Italy</hi>; which were ſo feared and apprehended at <hi>Rome,</hi> that all the conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Conſiſtory were to facilitate the Negotiations, and give ſuch ſatisfaction, as might prevent a War.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Aloiſé Grimani</hi> Ambaſſadour for the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> then reſiding at <hi>Paris,</hi> uſed all means poſſible to bring matters to a reaſonable underſtanding: in which he ſo well ſucceeded, that he procured a new Deputation for Plenipotentiaries to be nominated, and appointed by both ſides, and the place for Treaty to be <hi>Lions:</hi> So on the twentieth of <hi>February</hi> an Inſtrument was ſigned by the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour <hi>Grimani,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Crequi,</hi> and ſubſcribed alſo by Monſieur <hi>Tellier</hi> Secretary of State, and War; whereby it was concerted, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to enter upon a Treaty at the place aforeſaid, and that Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries ſhould be ſent thither with Commiſſions from his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Thus for ſome time whileſt the troubles were a little appeaſed, and quieted; the Court of <hi>France</hi> paſſed the <hi>Carneval</hi> with their uſual jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and entertained it ſelf with celebration of the marriage, between <hi>Madmoiſelle de Valois,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Count <hi>de Soiſſons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the perſon of the Duke at the ceremony of Eſpouſals. The which few days after was followed by the marriage of <hi>Madmoiſelle Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana Mancini</hi> Niece of Cardinal <hi>Mazarini,</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Buglion</hi> great Chamberlain of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the Plenipotentiaries preparing for their meeting at <hi>Lions: Aloiſé Sagredo</hi> arrived at <hi>Paris</hi> in quality of Ambaſſadour for the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and to ſucceed in the place of <hi>Grimani,</hi> who was to be aſſiſting in the Office of Mediation at <hi>Lions; Grimani,</hi> and Monſignor <hi>Raſponi</hi> Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary from the Pope met at the time, and place appointed; but the Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> on pretence of the Queen Mother's ſickneſs, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he deſired to be waited, and attended for, came not to <hi>Lions</hi> till towards the middle of <hi>May:</hi> where entering on their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, matters were proceeded to a hopeful condition of agreement; when on a ſudden they were unhappily interrupted, by the Title which the Pope ſent to <hi>Raſponi</hi> to be his Nuntio Extraordinary to all Chriſtian Princes: for whereas the <hi>French</hi> King had abſolutely determined, not to receive any perſon from the Pope with Title of Nuntio until the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences were accommodated between himſelf and <hi>Rome</hi>; the Treaty was by Order of the King broken off upon that punctilio; but afterwards was by Order renewed again at <hi>Bonvicino,</hi> a place ſituate on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Savoy</hi>; the Parochial Church of which is in the Dominions of <hi>France</hi>; and on the other ſide of the Bridg, (which is the Territory of <hi>Savoy</hi>) is an antient, and famous Monaſtery of <hi>Carmelite</hi> Friers; thither as we have ſaid the Treaty was transferred, where beſides <hi>Crequi, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponi,</hi> and <hi>Grimani,</hi> there were preſent the Agents for <hi>Modena,</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and the twelve Conſuls of <hi>Avigion; Raſponi</hi> took his quarters on the ſide of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the other on that of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the particulars were again debated; and the Pope was perſuaded to condeſcend to all the pretenſions of <hi>France,</hi> excepting onely to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of <hi>Caſtro</hi>; on which the King peremptorily inſiſted, becauſe he had engaged his Honour and Authority therein, by the Articles of Peace made at the <hi>Pyreneans.</hi> The Pope on the other ſide inſiſted. That it was not in his Power to paſs an Act ſo prejudicial to the Apoſtolical
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:50681:396"/>
Chair, and contrary to the many Bulls of his Predeceſſours. And thus whileſt both ſides inſiſted reſolutely on this Point with many delays and punctilios, which obſtructed a concluſion, the King diſpatched an expreſs to <hi>Rome,</hi> to know the ultimate reſolution of the Pope on that Point: and when anſwer was returned, that by reaſon of the Sentences paſſed by the Tribunals of Juſtice, and that <hi>Caſtro</hi> was in the <hi>Camera</hi> annexed to the triple Crown, and incorporated into the Dominions of the Church; he could not aſſent to have it diſmembred from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony: ſo ſoon, I ſay, as this news came, the Treaty broke off, every one returning to his Place and Country.</p>
               <p>During this Treaty at <hi>Buonvicinio,</hi> great preparations were making at <hi>Rome</hi> for a War; and when it broke up without agreement, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all expectation the Troops were disbanded, and the Officers Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; though in the mean time the <hi>French</hi> Troops began to march into <hi>Italy,</hi> which was the occaſion of a witty ſaying: <hi>That at</hi> Rome <hi>they armed, when they knew not with whom they were to have War, and diſarmed, when they knew not with whom they ſhould have Peace.</hi> And yet it is probable, and by moſt believed, that there was never any real deſign of Rupture by either ſide; but that the pretenſions, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for this War, were onely in appearance, and made ſubſervient to other Projects: though to make it appear real, the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> was ſent with a Fleet of Ships on the Coaſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> the approach of which gave an Allarm at the very Gates of <hi>Rome</hi>; but afterwards diſappeared, and ſtood off again into the Sea, pretending to be driven to <hi>Calari</hi> in <hi>Sardinia</hi> by Tempeſts and contrary Winds.</p>
               <p>And though neither the Pope, nor King (as was believed) were in earneſt in matter of a War; yet the ill correſpondence between them was judged prejudicial to Chriſtendom, and obſtructive to thoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which were intended againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> who had then lately made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Newhauſell,</hi> and was triumphant in <hi>Hungary.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Venetians</hi> with more warm inſtances than ever, laboured to renew the Treaty; in which Office the <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo judged themſelves obliged to join, becauſe they deſired to keep the Arms of <hi>France</hi> diſtant from <hi>Italy:</hi> and both one and the other uſed their endeavours ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually with the Pope and the King; that they both conſented to enter into another Treaty: and accordingly the <hi>French</hi> King conſtituted <hi>Monſignore Bourlemont</hi> then at <hi>Florence</hi> to be his Plenipotentiary, and the Pope ordained <hi>Raſponi</hi> with a like Power from him; <hi>Piſa</hi> being the place appointed for the Treaty: where after ſome few days of debate, all matters came to be concluded, and agreed in form, and manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That his Holineſs to pleaſe the moſt Chriſtian King, had aſſented to diſmember <hi>Caſtro</hi> from the Patrimony of the Church: conditionally that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> within the ſpace of eight years pay the ſum of eight millions ſix hundred and nineteen Crowns to the <hi>Camera:</hi> Of which ſum having paid one half, he ſhall be inveſted, and reſtored into one half of the Principality. And in caſe that any diſpute ſhall ariſe touching the diviſion of the moiety, the ſame ſhall be determined by two Arbitrators indifferently choſen, and they not agreeing, the difference ſhall be referred to the Umpirage of a third Perſon. Or otherwiſe the <hi>Camera</hi> making the diviſion, the Duke ſhall have Power to chuſe;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:50681:396"/>
or otherwiſe if the Duke makes the diviſion, then the choice ſhall be in the Power of the <hi>Camera.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> ſhall renounce all his pretenſions to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macchio.</hi> And the Pope at the inſtance of the King ſhall in lieu there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of give and ſurrender unto the ſaid Duke <hi>Mount d' Eſte,</hi> which was valued at two hundred and fifty thouſand Crowns or thereabouts; and ſhall remit to him the Intereſt which he owes to the <hi>Montiſts,</hi> which was eſtimated at fifty thouſand Crowns; together with a donative of forty thouſand Crowns, or in lieu thereof ſome Palace in <hi>Rome</hi> to the Duke's ſatisfaction. And that the Pope ſhall give a Bull of <hi>Jus Patronatus Perpetui</hi> to the Houſe of <hi>Eſte</hi> of the Abby of <hi>Pompoſa</hi>; and <hi>Bondeno,</hi> to which the Popes ſhall never pretend Right or Title.</q>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <q>That ſo ſoon as the Ratification of this Treaty ſhall arrive at <hi>Rome, Don Mario</hi> ſhall immediately depart from thence, and ſhall by a Writing under his hand, and upon the faith of a Gentleman declare, that he was no ways concerned in the late Riot of the <hi>Corſi</hi>; the which ſhall be confirmed by a Brief of the Pope avouching, and giving aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his innocence of that Fact: And that he ſhall not return to <hi>Rome</hi> until ſuch time, that his juſtification being carried to the King by the hand of the Legate, his Majeſty ſhall declare his pleaſure therein.</q>

                  <q>That <hi>Don Auguſtino</hi> ſhall upon approach of the Duke of <hi>Crequi</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> go forth to meet him as far as St. <hi>Quirico</hi> in caſe he comes by way of <hi>Toſcany:</hi> if by Sea, then he ſhall meet him at <hi>Civita-vecchia</hi>; if by <hi>Romagna,</hi> then at <hi>Narni</hi>; and ſhall there make known to him the great trouble, which the Pope hath conceived for the late accident.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That <hi>Donna Beronice,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Farneſe,</hi> ſhall go and meet the Lady Ambaſſadreſs, as far as <hi>Ponte Molle,</hi> where they ſhall both teſtifie the extraordinary ſorrow they conceived for the late misfortune which cauſed her departure, and the joy they have for her return, and happy underſtanding of all matters.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>That his Holineſs ſhall in a moſt effectual manner inſtruct his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to make known unto the Ambaſſadour, the high eſteem he hath for a perſonage of his Quality who repreſents the Perſon of ſo great a King, who is eldeſt Son of the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Duke of <hi>Ceſarini</hi> ſhall be reſtored to the poſſeſſion and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>joyment of his Goods, and Eſtate.</q>

                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:50681:397"/>
                  <q>That the like ſhall be obſerved, and practiſed towards all Perſons who have had any concernment in the late matter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the whole Nation of the <hi>Corſi</hi> ſhall be declared uncapable to ſerve not onely in <hi>Rome,</hi> but in any other part of the Eccleſiaſtical State. And that the Captain of the Guards in <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be caſhiered from his Office.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That a Pyramid ſhall be erected in <hi>Rome</hi> over againſt the place where the <hi>Corſi</hi> held their Corps of Guard, with an Inſcription de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the Crime for which they were baniſhed from the Eccleſiaſtical State.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That ſo ſoon as the Cardinal-Legat ſhould arrive at <hi>Paris,</hi> and the former particulars were accompliſhed, that then the King would again reſtore <hi>Avignon</hi> to the Pope: It being agreed that neither any of the Inhabitants, Strangers, or Sojourners there living, ſhall be troubled, or queſtioned for any thing they ſaid or acted in in the revolt of that City, which happened on the twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1662. or for any thing which paſſed on this occaſion from that time, until the day that his Majeſty reſtored it to the Pope.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Particulars thus agreed, and ſigned by the Plenipotentiaries were ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> to be ratified and confirmed; and in the mean time the Pope laboured to excuſe the baniſhment of <hi>Don Mario,</hi> and the ſending of Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> in quality of his Legat into <hi>France</hi>; but neither the one nor the other would be diſpenſed with. Wherefore <hi>Don Mario</hi> retired to <hi>Sora</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>; and Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> began his Journey with a noble Equipage and Attendance of Prelates and Gentlemen, amongſt which was Monſignor <hi>Colonna,</hi> appointed to reſide at <hi>Avignon</hi> in quality of Legat for the Pope. The Cardinal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entered into <hi>France,</hi> was received in all places with great honour, and ſplendid entertainment; and being conducted to <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> where the Court then reſided, he had his firſt Audience with the King; all things paſſing to the mutual ſatisfaction of both Parties. Some days after, Cardinal <hi>Imperiale</hi> arrived at <hi>Paris,</hi> to accompliſh another Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Treaty; where having juſtified himſelf according to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the King accepted his ſubmiſſion, and returned him with teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials, ſignifying the entire ſatisfaction he received by his Addreſs.</p>
               <p>The other Points in the Articles being to be executed at <hi>Rome</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Crequi,</hi> the Cardinals <hi>d' Eſte</hi> and <hi>Maldachino</hi> arrived there, and were received by the Pope, and the Court according to the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities agreed. And the Duke being likewiſe mollified by the Addreſſes which the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> made to him, as alſo by the Application made to him by the Cardinals <hi>Corrado,</hi> and <hi>Azzolino,</hi> who always ſpake loud and boldly againſt the <hi>French</hi>; all Animoſities were appeaſed, and theſe troubles ended, which had adminiſtred great vexation and unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the ſpirit of the Pope, during three years that they had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</p>
               <p>The Controverſies of <hi>France</hi> being thus happily compoſed, <hi>Don Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> had licence to return again to <hi>Rome</hi>; and the Pope had time to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the turbulencies in <hi>Spain,</hi> which were growing into dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, upon Diſputes raiſed concerning the Immaculate conception of the Bleſſed Virgin. The <hi>Dominicans</hi> violently maintained the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Tenent, in oppoſition to the <hi>Jeſuits</hi>; in which the Diſciples of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:50681:397"/>
both ſides became ſo concerned, that what could not be determined by a Moderator in the Schools, was in danger to be decided in the Fields, or Streets by the Sword. To prevent which, the King ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Piacenza</hi> to the Pope, deſiring his Sentence and determination of the queſtion, as being the Oracle to whom they were to have recourſe for ſolution in all difficulties of this nature. The Pope who was a great Favourer of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and their Doctrines, conſulted the queſtion with ſuch, who were inclined to that Opinion; and after ſome days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, he determined for the Immaculate Conception: which though he would not enter, or enumerate amongſt the Doctrines of Faith; yet he publiſhed a Bull, denouncing ſeveral Penalties, and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures againſt thoſe, who ſhould either publickly or privately maintain the contrary. And in the ſame year, he canonized <hi>Francis Sales</hi> Biſhop,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1665.</note> and Prince of <hi>Geneva</hi>; who by his Treatiſe called <hi>an Introduction to a Holy Life,</hi> hath given ſufficient teſtimony of a devout, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Soul.</p>
               <p>This year alſo the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> undertook to cenſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn two Books, the one of <hi>James Vernant,</hi> who aſſerts the Pope's Power, and Infallibility of the Pope in derogation of Councils, Kings, and Biſhops, and the other of <hi>Amadeus Guimenius,</hi> who defends the Morals of the <hi>Jeſuits:</hi> the Pope being diſpleaſed with this confidence of the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boniſts,</hi> who being but a Colledg only, ſhould preſume to determine Caſes of ſuch high nature, complained to the King, who in compliance with his Holineſs, aſſembled a Congregation of Biſhops at <hi>Pontoiſe</hi>; the which being met, paſſed a Cenſure on the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi>; not condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Opinion, but their preſumption for that being but a private Colledg, they ſhould uſurp a Power which appertained to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and not unto them. The Pope not ſatisfied with theſe imperfect proceedings, amends them at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by a Bull condemns the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi> under penalty of Excommunication. But this Doctrine of the Pope's could not be digeſted by the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> who appeared Favourers of the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi>; howſoever leſt theſe que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions ſhould engender diſcords, and cauſe great trouble in the State, they were ſilenced, and by the King's Authority ſuppreſſed, every one being under ſevere penalties forbidden to diſpute, or handle queſtions of this dangerous conſequence. Wherefore theſe Points being laid aſleep, rather than eradicated are ſometimes revived, and ſuffered to be ſtarted, whenſoever they are ſeaſonable, and judged commodious for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the State.</p>
               <p>The ſame year likewiſe the Pope condemned the five Propoſitions of <hi>Cornelius Janſenius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ypres</hi> concerning Grace, and Free-Will; and confirmed the Edict, which <hi>Innocent</hi> X. had made againſt them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, ſo little regard was had thereunto, that thoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are ſtill maintained and defended both by words and Writings. But now to proceed to his Acts and publick Works.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. might not appear leſs ſplendid in his publick Monuments, than other Popes: he repaired many Ruins, enlarged and adorned many Streets, much to the Ornament of the City, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:50681:398"/>The Pantheon which was a famous Temple of Old <hi>Rome,</hi> built by <hi>M. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa</hi>; and afterwards by <hi>Boniface</hi> IV. dedicated to the Bleſſed Virgin, he repaired, and altered with much advantage: for whereas formerly they deſcended unto it by ſteps, he filled the low places with rubbiſh, ſo that an entrance was made thereunto upon a level; and having raiſed the Pillars which were almoſt buried in the Earth, he therewith erected a ſtately <hi>Portico,</hi> making it a magnificent ſtructure, which before was filled up with dirt and rubbiſh caſt thereunto by the neighbouring Market.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Forum</hi> or Market-place, where the <hi>Columna Antoniana</hi> ſtands, he cleanſed, and removed all rubbiſh from it, and ſo beautified it on all ſides, that it is now a pleaſant, and convenient part of the City.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Archigymnaſium Romanum</hi> which was begun by <hi>Leo</hi> X. he finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and adorned with a ſumptuous Library; the Chamber for which, he erected at his own charge, and ſupplied it with excellent Books, for the common uſe of learned Men.</p>
               <p>He alſo deſigned to build a Colledg, wherein to entertain the moſt learned and famous Men of the Age, invited thereunto from all parts of the World. So that where any one was eſteemed excellent and famous in any Science, and eſpecially if he were learned, and an acute Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in Divinity; he might be here entertained with a convenient ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence: to ſupport which, and make a Revenue for this Colledg, he deſigned the deſolation of ſome Monaſteries, which having formerly been ordained with holy Diſcipline, and to a good end, were now fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from their original, and primary Inſtitution: but whileſt he was contemplating, and contriving this deſign, he became infirm, and afflicted with a Chronical Diſtemper, which abated the heat of his proceedings, which afterwards ended, and were wholly laid aſide by his death.</p>
               <p>He erected a noble, and magnificent Hall adjoyning to the <hi>Vatican,</hi> which he called an <hi>Archivium,</hi> or a place to lodge all Papers and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings relating to the Apoſtolical Sea; that is, all Papers rendering an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Negotiations of Nuntios in the Courts of forein Princes: Likewiſe the Letters written to Popes from the Governours, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Provinces belonging to the Church; ſuch Letters alſo as had been written concerning the Rights and Priviledges of the Papal Chair: for which there having formerly been no certain place allotted, wherein to conſerve them, they were diſperſed, and ſcattered in divers places, and many of them in the hands of ſuch, whoſe Uncles, or Relations had been Popes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Vatican</hi> Library he encreaſed with an addition of all the Books of the Dukes of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> both Manuſcripts, and Books printed; And leſt whileſt he was intent to the adornment of <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſhould ſeem for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful of his own City, he beautified the Cathedral Church of <hi>Siena,</hi> which by demoliſhing the Houſes which ſtood near it, he made a large, and open <hi>Area</hi> to it, removing all impediments which obſcured, or obſtructed the Proſpect. The barbarous <hi>Latin</hi> which is written about the outſide of this Church is very obſervable, the words are theſe:
<q>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:50681:398"/>
                     <l>Omnis centenus Romae ſemper eſt Jubilenus</l>
                     <l>Crimina laxantur, cui paenitet iſta donantur,</l>
                     <l>Et confirmavit Bonifacius, &amp; roboravit.</l>
                  </q>
Whileſt <hi>Alexander</hi> was employed in theſe, and other greater Works, he was eſteemed to have neglected thoſe aſſiſtances which former Popes have uſually given and contributed for ſupport of thoſe Princes, which have been borderers, and in War with the <hi>Turk,</hi> who is the grand Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Chriſtendom. Wherefore that he might give ſome inſtances to the contrary, in the year 1666.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1666.</note> he equipped his Fleet of Gallies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der command of <hi>Bichi,</hi> and having joined them with the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> (which by their Inſtitution are obliged to ſerve under the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the Church,) they entered the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and committed ſome ſpoils on the <hi>Maritime</hi> Towns, or places under Dominion of the <hi>Turk</hi>; in which having paſſed that Summer without any action very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable, they returned towards the end of the year to their Winter quarters: and this year the Pope recruited the Regiment which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> with two hundred Soldiers.</p>
               <p>During the twelve years of this Pope's Reign he created thirty eight Cardinals, of which eight were made in the laſt year of his life; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Roberti</hi> his Nuntio in <hi>France, Viſconti</hi> his Nuntio in <hi>Spain, Julio Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> his Nuntio to the Emperour, <hi>Caracciolo</hi> Auditor of the <hi>Camera</hi>; likewiſe <hi>John Dolfino</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Aquileia</hi> was made Cardinal at the inſtance of the <hi>Venetians, Ghidobald de Thun</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Saltzburg</hi> at the deſire of the Emperour, the Duke of <hi>Vendoſme</hi> in compliance with <hi>France,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Montalto</hi> to pleaſe <hi>Spain.</hi> And farther to exalt and dignifie the degree of Cardinals, he appointed a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacred Colledg to conſider, and direct ſome Formulary, or Rules which might ſerve to augment the Prerogatives of Cardinals in oppoſition to the pretences of the <hi>Roman</hi> Barons: one amongſt which was, that the little Bell, which was carried and ſounded before the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, ſhould be no more in uſe; for that the luſtre of their Purple was ſo evident, as needed no ſuch mean Signal to make them known.</p>
               <p>In fine, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> having reigned twelve years with frequent fits and agonies of the Stone; at length being worn out with buſineſs, and extremity of his Diſeaſe, he died on the twelfth day of <hi>May</hi> 1667. in the ſixty ninth year of his Age, having reigned twelve years, one month, and ſixteen days. Some time before his departure out of this World, he made a ſhort Diſcourſe to the Cardinals concerning the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of humane life, from which the greatneſs of Popes was not exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and which was more demonſtrable in him, by reaſon of the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical diſtemper under which he had for many years laboured; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the laſt with exhortations to elect ſuch a Pope, who might cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and make amends for thoſe Infirmities to which he had been ſubject.</p>
               <p>This Pope was naturally of a good habit of body, but much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a diſſection which was made for the ſtone in his Bladder, when he was at <hi>Colen</hi>; he was lean, and not very robuſt in his limbs, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever had ſuch ſtrength in the gripe of his hands, that ſcarce any one could quit himſelf from him, whom he had ſeized. He was of a middle
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:50681:399"/>
ſtature, of a pleaſant Air in his Countenance, and of excellent grace in Elocution, which was not much altered by the loſs of his teeth, which were looſened, and falled out by a continual defluxion of rheum upon his gums. He was very facetious and pleaſant in his Converſation, and delighted himſelf very much in reading the antient <hi>Latin</hi> Poets: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Cardinals came to congratulate his Election to the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate, he made uſe of that Verſe out of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>—Dies, quem ſemper acerbum</l>
                  <l>Semper honoratum (ſic vos voluiſtis) habebo.</l>
               </q>
               <p>This Pope was endued with natural parts in an extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and was very polite in his dreſs, and in his way of living: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover in the courſe of his years he gave an inſtance, and example to the World what difference there is in thoſe qualifications which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make up the virtues of a Prince, and of a private Perſon, or of a Pope, and a Prelate. For whileſt he onely wore the Purple of a Cardinal, he governed himſelf in ſuch a mean between the defects bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Pope that Reigned, and the Virtues deſired and expected in a Succeſſour, that he appeared the onely deſireable Perſon in the World, to whom with moſt confidence the Keys of St. <hi>Peter</hi> might be delivered. But being arrived at the top, and ſummary point of his Ambition, of his deſires and deſigns, he lived with much leſs caution and induſtry than before, and giving way to that vanity of Genius, which he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſuppreſſed or diſguiſed; he ſo amuſed himſelf in the oſtentation of Buildings, that he neglected both the concernments of Princes and the care of his People: And whileſt he laboured to exalt and enrich his Nephews and Kindred, he died unlamented, and much abated in that reputation, with which he entered into the Papal Chair.</p>

But firſt, and before they entered, a great Diſpute aroſe concerning the place where the <hi>Conclave</hi> was to be held; for that the <hi>Vatican</hi> being ſeated in a bad Air, was at that ſeaſon of the year reputed almoſt contagious, at leaſt ſo incommodious by reaſon of the exceſſive heats of the Summer, that it was judged pernicious to the health of all the Colledg; and therefore <hi>Monte Cavallo</hi> was propoſed, as a ſituation more ſecure, and which with the expence of two thouſand Crowns might be rendered as commodious as the <hi>Vatican:</hi> The Perſons appointed to overſee this Work, were the Cardinals <hi>Barberino, Orſino,</hi> and <hi>Eſte</hi>; who having conſidered thereof, made their report, that the

Notwithſtanding the badneſs of the Air, and the heat of the ſeaſon, which ſerved to haſten the Election; for though the Cardinals were divided into many Parties, and adhered to their ſeveral Intereſts; yet being wiſe Men, they knew to prefer health, and long life before other conſiderations whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Cardinals entering the <hi>Vatican</hi>; the third of <hi>June</hi> was the firſt day of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> which was divided into five ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Factions: the firſt was that of the <hi>Chigi,</hi> which was the moſt numerous of any, conſiſting of thirty four Votes; the ſecond was that of the <hi>Barberini,</hi> compoſed of ſixteen; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of nine, and the <hi>French</hi> of ſeven; and laſtly the <hi>Flying Squadron</hi> made up of the <hi>Pamfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> and other male-contents, formed a party of about ten Voices: of which <hi>Imperiale,</hi> and <hi>Azzolini</hi> were the chief, who joyning themſelves to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cardinals oppoſed at the firſt Scrutiny the election of <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> in ſuch manner, that he ſeemed excluded from all poſſibility of being Pope: howſoever his Party had certainly prevailed, had not <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berino</hi> with his Aſſociates oppoſed the Choice: for though <hi>Farneſe</hi> was a Perſon qualified with all the knowledg of Political Laws, and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Canons; yet the memory of what had paſſed, between his Uncle <hi>

And having hereunto joined the Cardinals of the <hi>Flying Squadron,</hi> with ſeveral others; he went to the Apartment of Cardinal <hi>Chigi,</hi> to whom in the name of his Party, he gave him to underſtand, that they were ſufficiently ſenſible, that the Power of his Enemy in the <hi>Conclave</hi> was ſuch; that none was in a poſſibility of being created Pope, without his aſſent and concurrence; and therefore they were come to know which of his Creatures he judged worthy of his ſuffrage. To which <hi>Chigi,</hi> after having returned thanks to <hi>Barberino,</hi> made this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, That all his Friends were beloved, and eſteemed by him with that equality of affection, that he knew not how to prefer one before ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or by the nomination of one to diſoblige others. Whereunto <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berino</hi> made Anſwer, That ſince his Eminence was not pleaſed to name any, he would propoſe <hi>Roſpiglioſi,</hi> which <hi>Chigi</hi> ſeemed readily to accept; but in reality his mind was contrary, as appeared by the Scrutiny, in which his Vote was otherwiſe diſpoſed. And indeed <hi>Chigi</hi> had no great affection for the perſon of <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi>; having not only taken ſome diſguſt againſt him in the time that he ſerved in quality of Secretary to his Uncle <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. but alſo had diſcovered the bad inclination which many others of the <hi>Chigian</hi> Party had to him: at which <hi>Barbarino</hi> did not openly demonſtrate any great reſentment, hoping that by ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays and Controverſies, he might ſpin a Clue ſo fine, as would lead and conduct him to the heighth of his deſires; and indeed he had improved
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:50681:400"/>
his intereſt ſo well, that he had attained to nineteen Votes. In the mean time endeavours were made for the Cardinals <hi>Brancacci, Spinola, Elci,</hi> and others which prolonged the iſſue of Affairs, which every Cardinal by reaſon of the heats, and ill Air deſired to conclude, that ſo they might be enlarged from their confinement, which began to be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthful that many of the Cardinals fell ſick, as alſo their <hi>Conclaviſts</hi> who attended them, and Cardinal <hi>Sforſa Palavicino</hi> died: the which gave ſuch an allarm to the whole <hi>Conclave,</hi> that the Cardinals reſolved on a diſpatch, which in all probability appeared moſt eaſie in the Perſon of <hi>Roſpiglioſi.</hi> The intereſt which moſt oppoſed it, was that of <hi>Chigi</hi>; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the other Cardinals uniting their Power, induced <hi>Chigi</hi> to concur, leſt a Pope ſhould be choſen in deſpight of his oppoſition, and againſt his conſent; wherefore <hi>Chigi</hi> and <hi>Barbarino</hi> agreeing upon the matter concerted with the factions of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> though the Cardinal <hi>Vandorme</hi> was not well pleaſed with the Choiſe.</p>
               <p>In fine, all Parties agreeing, the Cardinals haſtned into the Chappel; where <hi>Barbarino</hi> and <hi>Azzolino,</hi> having procured thirty one Votes for <hi>Roſpiglioſi; Chigi</hi> and his Party came in, and concurred with the reſt, ſo that of ſixty four Cardinals then in the <hi>Conclave, Roſpiglioſi</hi> was elected, and created Pope by ſixty one.</p>
               <p>Thus after eighteen days that this <hi>Conclave</hi> had continued, <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> was on the twentieth of <hi>June</hi> proclaimed Pope by Cardinal <hi>d' Eſte</hi> with theſe words, which are according to the uſual form:</p>
               <q>Annuncio vobis Gaudium magnum. Habemus Eminentiſſimum, &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verendiſſimum Dominum Cardinalem Julium Roſpiglioſum in Summum Pontificem, qui vocatur Clemens Nonus.</q>
               <p>After which the uſual Adoration followed which was performed by the Cardinals, and the Pope being habited in his Pontifical Veſtments, was carried in proceſſion with attendance of all the Cardinals to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Church. And on the 26th. of <hi>June</hi> he was there Crowned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all the Rites and Ceremonies of Popes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Julio Roſpiglioſi</hi> was born at <hi>Piſtoia,</hi> a City in the Dominions of the Great Duke of <hi>Toſcany</hi>; his Family was Noble, and much more illuſtrated by his own Vertues and Fortune. For being naturally of a quick and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtanding, he plentifully anſwered the expectation of his Parents, rendering abundant fruits in return of that care, and expence they had employed in his Education: and being arrived at ſome maturity of age, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. then reigning, obſerved a genius in him fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for buſineſs; ſo that the firſt ſtep he made to preferment was by the favour of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> who made him Auditor to his Nephew Cardinal <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berin,</hi> when he ſent him in a ſolemn manner with the Character of his Legat into <hi>France,</hi> and then into <hi>Spain</hi> with Inſtructions to compoſe the differences about the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and eſtabliſh a happy Peace between the two Kings: in which Employment he ſo well diſcharged and acquitted himſelf, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> made him his Nuntio in Ordinary to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>; the which Office, though commonly conferred but for three years, yet <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> made himſelf ſo pleaſing unto and eſteemed by his Catholick Majeſty, and ſo uſeful to the Intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> that his Commiſſion was continued for the full ſpace of eleven years, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and plenary ſatisfaction both of the Pope, and the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:50681:400"/>After the death of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. thoſe who had taken the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into their hands under <hi>Innocent</hi> X. beholding <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> with an Eye of envy, and emulation, cauſed him to be recalled from his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Nuntio, to make room for ſome other Favourite. After which returning to <hi>Rome,</hi> he lived in a private manner without other prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than of one of the Canons of <hi>Santa Maria Maggiore,</hi> until the death of this Pope, when during the vacancy of the Sea, he was by the unanimous conſent of the Colledg of Cardinals conſtituted Governour of <hi>Rome</hi>; which at that time is always ſo licentious, that it requires a ſober, ſevere, and vigilant Officer to reſtrain the abuſes and outrages which are daily committed in the City.</p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. being elected Pope, to whom the Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Vertues of <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> were ſufficiently known, he choſe him for his Secretary of State; and to render him the more conſiderable in that Office, he conferred on him the honour of the Cardinals Hat; in which employment he gave ſuch teſtimonies of his abilities and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, that <hi>Alexander</hi> would uſually ſay, <hi>That he was ſerved by a Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary after his own heart, on whom he could confidently rely, and repoſe all his cares.</hi> And indeed his Services were not onely pleaſing to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but in ſuch manner conſpicuous to the whole Colledg of Cardinals, and to all <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſerved him for a ſtep to that high promotion to which he ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> being Elected, Crowned, and eſtabliſhed in the Papal Chair (as we have ſaid) under the name of <hi>Clement</hi> IX. he in the firſt place rendered thanks to every Cardinal in particular, for the ſuffrage he had given him, and then to them all in general in a full Conſiſtory; where he delivered himſelf with ſuch eloquent expreſſions, and with ſuch excellency of Speech, as gave ſufficient proof of the gift of Rhetorick, with which he was naturally endued, and which with an admirable elocution adorned all the Speeches which he made in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>It hath been the cuſtom of Popes to perform ſome Act after their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, which may reconcile the minds of the people to them; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly this Pope, that he might give ſome Eſſay of his liberal and generous inclinations towards the Publick; he in the firſt place took care, that Proviſions might be cheap and plentiful at <hi>Rome,</hi> and eaſed the People of ſome Taxes with which they were burdened; and on this occaſion he cauſed certain Medals of Gold and Silver to be ſtamped, with the impreſſion of a Pelican, and with this Motto: <hi>Non ſibi, ſed aliis Clemens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, To give ſome indications of his Mind to the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe reſolutions, which he had taken to govern with Prudence, Wiſdom, and ſevere adherence to Righteouſneſs and Judgment, he ſtamped this Motto on the firſt Money he coined: <hi>Conſtantia Silverii ad imitandum propoſita.</hi> For he himſelf being elected Pope on <hi>Silverius,</hi> or St. <hi>Sylveſters</hi>'s day, who was a Pope firm and ſteady to his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and unmoveable in matters which related to the welfare of the Church, he took this Omen for an Admonition, obliging him to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern with the ſame Spirit, which animated his Predeceſſour <hi>Sylverius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:50681:401"/>Wherefore, attending to the welfare of his Subjects, and to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Chriſtian Cauſe, he eaſed (as we have ſaid) his People of ſeveral Taxes, and in lieu thereof charged himſelf with a Debt of a million of Crowns: to extinguiſh which, and to make that proviſion which the <hi>Venetians</hi> required againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> who that year hardly preſſed the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> he aſſented to the diſſolution of certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſes, which ſeemed ſuperfluous and of little benefit, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the Church; namely, the Canons of St. <hi>George</hi> in <hi>Alga,</hi> the <hi>Geſuati,</hi> the <hi>Jeronimites</hi> of <hi>Fieſole</hi>; which being places remote, and of no great uſe, were formerly under the conſideration of <hi>Innocent</hi> X. and <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. and by both marked out with deſign to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, when the emergent preſſures of the Republick ſhould require a ſupply. And now that time being come: for the <hi>Vizier Kuperlee</hi> had for above the ſpace of a whole year beſieged the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> had ſtrongly intrenched himſelf, and being daily re inforced with new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, was in a probable and fair way to gain the Town, and therewith to become Maſter of all the Iſland of <hi>Candia.</hi> Wherefore the Pope iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his Bull, granting licence to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Republick to ſell the Lands and Revenues belonging to thoſe places afore-mentioned within their Dominions, and to make uſe of the Money to carry on their War, and expel the <hi>Turks</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>Candia.</hi> In this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture the Pope intended to avail himſelf of the urgencies, and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Republick; and to induce them thereby to conſent to the abolition of certain Laws, which were, and had been very derogatory to the Power of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>: but the wiſe Republick adhering to the ſame principles which influenced them in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> V. declared their unſhaken conſtancy, and reſolution to admit no innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a nature as was demanded: of which the Pope being well adviſed, relinquiſhed his pretenſions; it ſeeming unſeaſonable to take an advantage on the preſent emergencies of the Republick, to obtain that from them, which could not be granted without unhinging the whole frame of the publick Liberty.</p>
               <p>And though the ſuppreſſion of theſe Convents proceeded currently within the Dominions of the Republick; yet on this occaſion great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Diſputes aroſe between the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Naples.</hi> For at <hi>Milan</hi> they pretended that theſe Convents being of Royal foundation could not be diſſolved without the King's conſent; and at <hi>Naples</hi> they refuſed to admit, that the Money ariſing from the diſſolved Convents, ſhould be diſpoſed according to the will and pleaſure of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; denying all Power to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop to intermeddle therein, as Delegate to the Pope, by vertue of his Eccleſiaſtical Authority: and this Controverſie was maintained with that heat, that the Provoſt of <hi>Naples</hi> oppoſed the Arch biſhop with arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bands, when he came to execute the Decrees of <hi>Rome</hi>; on which the Pope made uſe of his thundering Excommunications: howſoever they availed little; for the heats were blown into a flame, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters become ſo intrigueſom, as not to be compoſed, until the time of <hi>Clement</hi> X. the ſucceeding Pope.</p>
               <p>Howſoever, this Pope being in an extraordinary manner zealous for the ſucceſs of the Chriſtian Cauſe againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> and ſollicitous for the preſervation of <hi>Candia,</hi> omitted no means which might conduce to the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:50681:401"/>
ſafety of it. And therefore after the example of his Predeceſſours, he laboured to engage the Chriſtian Princes in a holy League againſt the <hi>Turk:</hi> but in regard that it could not poſſibly be performed, until ſuch time as a Peace was concluded between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> the Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called his Nephew Cardinal <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> from <hi>Bruxels,</hi> where for the ſpace of three years he had reſided in quality of Internuntio, by Commiſſion from <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. ordering him in his return home to paſs through <hi>Paris,</hi> and in a private manner to complement the King, endeavouring to diſcover the inclinations of his Majeſty to a Peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> and how he was diſpoſed to yield thoſe ſuccours, which were neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for the preſervation of <hi>Candia.</hi> In purſuance hereof <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> performed the Offices enjoined him by his Uncle ſo well, that he incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the mind of his Majeſty to ſuccour <hi>Candia,</hi> which was languiſhing and almoſt ready to expire, and to yield itſelf to the prevailing Arms of the <hi>Turk:</hi> and hence it was, that Count S. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur la Fenillade,</hi> with many other Cavaliers adventuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this generous Enterpriſe, at leaſt prolonged the fate, though not able to divert it, or reſcue <hi>Candia</hi> from the ſubjection of it's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Enemies. Moreover, <hi>Roſpiglioſi</hi> made thoſe impreſſions of kindneſs, and good correſpondence between the King and the Pope, as continued during the whole term of his Uncle's Reign: and as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this friendſhip, the Pope upon return of his Nephew at <hi>Rome,</hi> diſpatched the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Thebes</hi> in quality of Legat in Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary into <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Frederick Borromeo</hi> with a like Character into <hi>Spain</hi>; which Legats finding a diſpoſition in both Kings towards a Peace ſo well negotiated in behalf of the intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. of <hi>France,</hi> and the Queen Regent of <hi>Spain</hi> (her Son being in his mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) appointed <hi>Aquiſgrane</hi> for the place to treat a Peace, of which the Pope was by mutual conſent of both Kings ordained the ſole Umpire and Moderator. The zeal which affected the Pope for the ſuccour, and relief of <hi>Candia</hi> was ſo great, that he laboured with all his Power to bring the Peace between the two Crowns to a ſpeedy iſſue; but the <hi>French</hi> King proceeding in a proſperous courſe of his Arms, concluded that his ſucceſſes did merit, and require the grant of ſuch conditions from his Catholick Majeſty, as were not conſiſtent with the honour and welfare of that Crown, and therefore reſolved to make an entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Franch Compte,</hi> before he entered into farther Treaties, or reſtrain himſelf within any narrower bounds or limits than thoſe he deſigned.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being declared General for this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in the beginning of the year 1668.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1668.</note> he marched to <hi>Digion</hi> in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> to prepare military Affairs in a readineſs to begin early the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Campaign: the King alſo, notwithſtanding the inconvenience of the Winter ſeaſon, thought fit to be there preſent in Perſon, which gave that life to action; that neither cold, or rains, or ſhortneſs of the days in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted the progreſs of the War; the Officers and Soldiers iſſuing from their Winter quarters, with the ſame chearfulneſs as in the Summer, readily inveſted the moſt conſiderable places of the <hi>Franch Compte,</hi> which in a few days ſurrendred themſelves to the victorious Arms of the <hi>French</hi>; leaving the World to wonder at thoſe effects of fear, which a ſudden ſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prize had produced; for thoſe Cities and Fortreſſes which in other times
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:50681:402"/>
had valiantly ſtood out for many months againſt the Sieges and ſtorms of their Enemies; did now ſhamefully yield ſo ſoon as they diſcovered the <hi>French</hi> Banners diſplayed before their Walls. To this ſucceſs the ſurpriſe of the action did much contribute; for had the King deferred this enterpriſe until the Summer, 'tis more than probable, that he might have encountred a greater oppoſition by the union of the <hi>German</hi> Princes, who in a ſeaſon fit for Armies to take the Field, would ſcarce have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo conſiderable a part as the <hi>Franch Compte</hi> to be lopped off, and diſmembred from the Body of the Empire.</p>
               <p>This ſudden and unexpected ſucceſs begat a jealouſie in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes; and was the firſt moving Cauſe which gave beginning to the Triple League between <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> leaving a door open to other Princes to be comprehended (as they ſhould ſee cauſe) in the ſame Agreement.</p>
               <p>This Sacred Alliance became the common diſcourſe of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and many happy effects were expected as conſequences thereof. In which conjuncture our <hi>Clement</hi> IX. renewing his former ſollicitations for Peace, procured a ſuſpenſion of Arms; and though he deſired that <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> ſhould be the places appointed for this Treaty: yet <hi>Aquiſgrane</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſteemed a place more convenient for the Electoral Princes, who were much concerned in this Accommodation, it was by common conſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the onely place of Treaty.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>France</hi> at the inſtant preſſures of ſo many powerful Princes inclining to hearken unto Propoſitions of Peace; and the King calling to remembrance his Articles with the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> not to make a Peace with <hi>Spain</hi> in excluſion of him; he immediately ſent his Advices to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> adviſing that King to diſpatch his Plenipotentiary to <hi>Aquiſgrane</hi> which was appointed for the place of Treaty.</p>
               <p>This intimation being given to the Court of <hi>Portugal</hi>; the Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> Son of the late Favourite, being then a Priſoner at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> taken at the Battel of <hi>Canal,</hi> began to propoſe ſeveral Conditions in order to a Peace; for which afterwards receiving a Commiſſion from <hi>Madrid</hi>; a Treaty was ſeparately ſet on foot without concerning <hi>France</hi> in it. At this time the Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> reſided at the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Ambaſſadour from his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> a Perſon ſo well affected by both Courts, that by mutual conſent of both Parties he was in the place of the King his Maſter, choſen Umpire of the Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Kingdoms. This Overture being acceptable to our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious King, he ſent his Orders and Inſtructions to the Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> to remove from <hi>Madrid</hi> to <hi>Lisbon</hi>; there to be Arbitrator of the Peace, and in order thereunto to perform all the good Offices of Mediation. The Plenipotentiaries being accordingly aſſembled at <hi>Lisbon</hi>; after ſome few Conferences between the Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and Count <hi>Olivarez</hi> a Peace was concluded, and publiſhed in the month of <hi>March,</hi> without any reſpect or conſideration to the agreement contracted the year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with <hi>France,</hi> or the endeavours of the Abbat of St. <hi>Romain</hi> to the contrary. And indeed the People were grown ſo weary of a War, which had continued for the ſpace of twenty eight years, that they were ready to have broken out into a common mutiny, had the leaſt interruption been given thereunto, the Commonalty ſcarce tempering their rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter, for labouring to diſappoint that happineſs they had ſo long deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:50681:402"/>Some few days after the Peace was proclaimed: a Sentence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, declaring the Marriage void between the King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> and the Queen was publiſhed, grounded on the ſuppos'd impotency of the King her Husband, whereby the Matrimonial knot was diſſolved, and both Parties freed, and ſtated in a lawful ſeparation with power to diſpoſe of their own Perſons. The confirmation of this act of Divorce was a ſubject of ſerious conſideration to the Pope, but afterwards when it was to extend ſo far, as to make the Prince lawful poſſeſſour of his Brother's Wife and Dominions, it was ſo much the more weighty and worthy conſideration: but at length reaſons of State, and conveniences of that Kingdom overſwayed the ſtrict Rules and Canons of the Church.</p>
               <p>But in the firſt place, we muſt underſtand that this Divorce was the conſequence of a general revolt of the People from their King; for they being guided by a prevailing Party in oppoſition to the <hi>Conde de Caſſel Meglior</hi> Chief Miniſter of State, murmured againſt the Government, and perhaps not without ſome cauſe; for the King himſelf being given to Wine, practiſed ſuch extravagancies as were intolerable, and which did not paſs without ſome reflections on the Favourite, though as to himſelf he managed all things with prudence and good conduct: Moreover, the <hi>Conde</hi> oppoſing the Peace with <hi>Caſtile,</hi> on other terms, than ſuch as were agreeable to the method, and Articles concluded with <hi>France,</hi> became ſo diſpleaſing to the People, that he was diſplaced from his Office, and the Prince admitted to the ſole management and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Affairs. But the Conſpiracy ſtopped not its courſe at this period: for the Queen hereupon retiring into a Monaſtery, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the diſſatisfaction ſhe had to the King her Husband, demanded the juſtice of the Country (upon the cauſes given) to diſſolve the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial knot by a ſentence of lawful Divorce. The People at this news were ſtirred with great commotions, and being naturally enclined to Novelty joined with the Prince's Party to chuſe him Governour of the Kingdom, committing the Perſon of the King to ſafe cuſtody, until the States of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſhould otherwiſe provide in caſes of this great emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency. The States being aſſembled about the beginning of the year, approved the reaſons for depoſing the King, and confirmed the Regency on the Prince: and upon hearing the Cauſe between the King and Queen. the Marriage was found void, and null; and accordingly an Inſtrument of Divorce was formed and publiſhed, and licenſe given to the Prince to take the Queen for his Wife, on ſuppoſition that ſhe was ſtill a Virgin, and unknown to his Brother. The caſe though ſtrange to ſcrupulous Ears, and Conſciences was not yet without former examples. For in <hi>Poland John Caſimiro</hi> ſucceeded to the Crown, and to the Wife of his Brother <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus.</hi> And in former Hiſtories of <hi>Portugal,</hi> it is recorded, that the Nobility deſired <hi>John</hi> III. to match with the Queen <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>ora,</hi> relict of King <hi>Emanuel</hi> his Father: and therefore this caſe was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Precedent, which after diſſolution of the Marriage, and publication of the Queen's divorce from <hi>Alfonſo</hi> VI. might confirm, and make law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the eſpouſals with the Prince his Brother.</p>
               <p>A particular account of all theſe Occurrences being given at <hi>Paris,</hi> by the <hi>Sicur Verius</hi> who then reſided at <hi>Lisbon</hi> for the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> The Cardinal <hi>Vandoſme</hi> then Legat <hi>à Latere</hi> from the Pope to the moſt Chriſtian King, immediately diſpatched a Brief of diſpenſation into

                  <hi>Portugal,</hi> in the name and by the Authority of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> IX. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the former Sentence given by the States, and Juſtitiaries of that Kingdom; leaving this example to the World, that there may be a Caſe wherein a younger Brother may lawfully uſurp the Dominion of his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and righteouſly poſſeſs himſelf of his Wife, and of his Crown. But the Prince <hi>Don Pedro</hi> not ſatisfied with the ſingle diſpenſation of the Cardinal <hi>Vandoſme,</hi> who for the ſpace of two months only was commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated to be Legat <hi>à Latere</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> to aſſiſt at the Baptiſm of the <hi>Dolfin</hi> in behalf of the Pope: did for better aſſurance diſpatch Father <hi>Villa</hi> a <hi>Jeſuit</hi> the Queens Confeſſour unto <hi>Rome</hi> to procure a more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick diſpenſation from the Pope himſelf. The Caſe being new, and ſtrange and difficult to find a way, how to make this matter with its preſent circumſtances to become legal: the Pope troubled within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf propoſed the caſe in publick Conſiſtory, where after long debates on both ſides, the queſtion ſtill remained dubious and undecided; until it was averred, that the Queen was ſeveral months gone with Child: the which circumſtance altered the caſe, and then the convenience of the Marriage was not farther alledged, but the neceſſity thereof urged, both for the reputation of the Queen and ſafety of that Kingdom, which could not otherwiſe be ſetled but by the Pope's definitive Sentence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the legality of the Divorce; and though the Pope hereupon granted his Bull, diſpenſing both with the Marriage and tranſlation of the Power, yet the minds of the contrary Party were not ſo quieted, but that ſeveral Conſpiracies were contrived againſt the life of the Prince; and particularly a certain Prieſt was apprehended with a Dagger in his Pocket, and confeſſed, that he deſigned therewith to ſtab the Prince, judging it an action meritorious and pleaſing to God, to deſtroy a perſon guilty of Rebellion, and Inceſt, who had uſurped the Kingdom, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed away the Wife of his Brother. Wherefore the Prince was in a manner conſtrained for his own ſecurity, and for ſettlement of himſelf in the Adminiſtration of Affairs to remove the King from the Eyes of the people, and accordingly he was tranſported into the Iſlands of <hi>Teraeras.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> (as we have ſaid) having gained their point by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Franch Comte,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having concluded a Peace with <hi>Portugal</hi>; and the triple League being well formed and concluded, the conjuncture of Affairs ſeemed propitious, and tending towards the calm of Peace; to improve which, the Pope laboured with inceſſant ſollicitations between both Kings to commence that Treaty which was once propoſed to be held at <hi>Aquiſgrana</hi>; and now more inſtantly deſired by him, not only in relation to his Office of Mediator between Chriſtian Princes: but in zeal to the Chriſtian Cauſe which then ſuffered in the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> which with the whole Iſland was then in danger, and ready to yield to the Arms of the <hi>Turks</hi>; hoping that upon concluſion of the Peace, the force of Chriſtendom would be converted from itſelf, and employed againſt the common Enemy (as we may believe.) But the Interceſſion and good Offices of the Pope did not ſo effectually operate towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of Peace as the Negotiations of the triple League were avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: by means of which the Peace was projected firſt on the 15th. of <hi>April</hi> at St. <hi>Germans,</hi> and afterwards concluded between both Crowns on the 27th. of <hi>April</hi> at <hi>Aquiſgrana,</hi> otherwiſe called by the <hi>French Aux la Chappelle</hi> in form following:</p>

               </p>
               <p>This was the ſubſtance of matters agreed at <hi>Aix la Chappelle,</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the <hi>French:</hi> but antiently <hi>Aquiſgrana,</hi> from <hi>Grano</hi> (as ſome think) the Brother of <hi>Nero</hi>; who for the convenience of ſome hot Waters, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing near thereunto, built a Town and a Fortreſs; to which he gave his own name, with the adjunction of <hi>Aqua</hi> in reference to the Waters: it is now an Imperial Town ſituate between the <hi>Moſel</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for being the place where the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours were firſt Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Inaugurated; and where <hi>Charles</hi> the Great was interred, whoſe Monument is there to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:50681:404"/>But now having touched on the Treaty concluded at this place, ſo far as concerned <hi>Clement</hi> IX. who was a promoter thereof, it will be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to this Hiſtory to recount the Councils, the ſucceſſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings which iſſued thereupon. Nor will it be to our purpoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe the Inſtrument by which the Triple League was eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the States of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> with the various Acts, and ſucceſſes thereupon. Nor is it to our purpoſe to declare the diſturbances given to this Peace by the pretenſions which the <hi>French</hi> made to the dependencies, which were ſo comprehenſive, as took in almoſt all the Dominions belonging to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries</hi>; for the better interpretation, underſtanding and limitation of which word (<hi>Dependencies</hi>) a meeting was appointed at <hi>Liſle,</hi> at which the Commiſſioners for both Crowns were to be preſent, and debate the Controverſie. Wherefore to return now to the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the actions of <hi>Clement</hi> IX. we find him after the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Peace extreamly intent and zealous for the relief of <hi>Candia,</hi> and urgent both with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> to ſend ſuccours thereunto. In purſuance of which, his endeavours in <hi>France,</hi> (as we have ſaid) were very ſucceſsful, great ſuccours being ſent to <hi>Candia</hi> as we have related in our Hiſtory of the <hi>Turks</hi>; and indeed the correſpondence was ſo good between his Chriſtian Majeſty and this Pope during the whole time of his Reign; that nothing ſeemed to be denied which was requeſted by either: for the Pope at the King's deſire granted a Bull, allowing him to nominate, and conſtitute ſuch perſons as he ſhould judg fit, in all Churches, Benefices and Monaſteries, and in all Biſhopricks and Arch-biſhopricks within his own Dominions. In return of which kindneſs, and as a ſignal of this good correſpondence, the <hi>French</hi> King allowed the Pope to demoliſh the Pillar, which was erected at <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. for a memorial of the baniſhment of the <hi>Corſi,</hi> and to deface the Inſcription engraven thereon; In like manner the Pope gave licenſe to the <hi>French</hi> to take away and demoliſh the Croſs which was erected at <hi>Rome</hi> over againſt the Church of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> in the time of <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. in memory of the converſion of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Faith. So that now the other particulars concluded at the Treaty of <hi>Piſa</hi> not as yet executed began to wear out, and to be forgotten, and the late warm interpoſition of <hi>France</hi> in behalf of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> for what related to <hi>Caſtro,</hi> became cold and remiſs. For though in the days of <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. the Duke had provided his Money according to the time allotted him by the Treaty, upon payment of which <hi>Caſtro</hi> was to have been redeemed; yet the Pope found out ways to avoid the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving thereof; pretending that other Creditors were ready to attach and ſequeſter the Money, ſo ſoon as it ſhould be brought within the Walls of the City: but this being only an excuſe, and an artificial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Pope, the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> reſolved to expect the arrival of the Duke of <hi>Chaunes</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> then coming in quality of Ambaſſadour from <hi>France,</hi> to whom making his complaint, he might moſt properly by his means challenge a performance of that part of the Treaty, which was in his favour concluded and agreed at <hi>Piſa.</hi> But this Expedient failing, and the Ambaſſadour taking this matter a little to heart: the Duke ſupplied his Money at <hi>Rome</hi> by Letters of Credit, and Bills of Exchange, which though refuſed by the Court notwithſtanding the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:50681:404"/>
addreſſes, Proceſſes made according to the Methods and formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Law; yet all proved ineffectual, and little regarded by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>France,</hi> even to the very time of this preſent Pope; of which coldneſs, and unconcernment of his Chriſtian Majeſty in this matter, wherein he once ſhewed ſo much zeal and affection, various cauſes have been aſſigned; of which none ſeems to be more probable, than the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of <hi>France</hi> in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> during the time of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> VII. and afterwards the kind correſpondence held with this <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> IX. of which the Crown of <hi>France</hi> being entirely ſatisfied, was unwilling to be importunate, or diſturb the quiet of the Church for the ſake of a forein Prince, whoſe intereſt had no influence, or concernment at that time with the welfare and conveniencies of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Pope was inſtant with his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to ſend Forces into <hi>Candia</hi>; and obtained by his ſollicitations a ſtrong Fleet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> which carried the Banner of the Church: ſo alſo he was not remiſs, or backward to ſend and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his own Fleet of Gallies, under the conduct and command of his Nephew <hi>Vincenzo Roſpiglioſi,</hi> which with the Gallies of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Malta</hi> made up the number of twenty nine. Nor was <hi>Clement</hi> leſs urgent with <hi>Spain,</hi> than with other Princes to enter, and engage in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe of Chriſtianity; ſo that having occaſion to ſend the Abbat <hi>Arroldi</hi> who was Biſhop of <hi>Milan</hi> in quality of his Internuntio to <hi>Bruxels,</hi> he gave him particular Inſtructions to ſollicite the Catholick Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> to concur with the reſt in contribution towards the relief of <hi>Candia:</hi> in which Act the Internuntio ſo well ſucceeded, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Argentina,</hi> or <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes of the <hi>Rhine</hi> adminiſtred effectual ſuccours to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity of that languiſhing place. But the ſucceſſes of this War and the fate of <hi>Candia</hi> have been our Subject, and Theme in an other Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>In the mean time whilſt theſe Affairs were in agitation, the Cardinals <hi>Palotta,</hi> and <hi>Farneſe,</hi> two of the chief Ornaments of the College de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this life: in place of whom the Pope promoted Prince <hi>Leopold</hi> of <hi>Toſcany</hi> to the dignity of Cardinal; a Perſon though of excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of mind, and of unblameable converſation in the days of his youth, yet reaſons of State had prevented his juſt advancement, and Title to the Purple, until the time of his old Age. After which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted <hi>Portocarrero</hi> with ſeven others to the ſame degree of Cardinals, <hi>viz. Altieri</hi> who was Maſter of the <hi>Camera, Nerli,</hi> who was Secretary of the Briefs, <hi>Pallavicino</hi> Dean of the Clerks of the <hi>Camera, Certi</hi> Dean of the <hi>Ruota, Bonaccorſi</hi> Treaſurer General, <hi>Acciaoli</hi> Auditor General of the <hi>Camera,</hi> and Father <hi>Buona</hi> Abbat of St. <hi>Bernard</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> beſides which he created <hi>James Roſpiglioſi</hi> his Brother's Son, and <hi>Emanuel Theodoſio,</hi> who draws his pedigree from the Dukes of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> ſo that during his Reign at three promotions he created twelve Cardinals, and not more.</p>
               <p>The moſt important Affair during the Reign of this Pope, was the Siege of <hi>Candia,</hi> which (as we have ſaid) ſo affected him, that he employed all his thoughts and endeavours towards the relief thereof; <hi>Nicholas</hi> the fifth was not ſo much troubled for the loſs of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> nor <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> VI. for the ſubjection of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> nor <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> for the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:50681:405"/>
of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> as our <hi>Clement</hi> IX. for the ill ſucceſs and concluſion of the <hi>Cretian</hi> War; in which the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> being loſt with many <hi>French</hi> Cavaliers, and other generous Heroes from divers parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, the City was delivered into the hands of the <hi>Turks:</hi> the fatal news of which being brought to him by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadour; the Pope (as is reported) was ſo affected therewith, that grief taking a deep impreſſion in his heart, he ſuddenly fell into a ſpecies of Apoplexy, from which firſt Fit, though he at preſent revived, yet melancholy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his ſpirits in ſuch manner, that in the ſpace of one month fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, he on the ninth of <hi>December</hi> 1669. expired his laſt breath, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving lived ſeventy one years or thereabouts, and governed the Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate two years, five months and eighteen days. He was univerſally la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, being a Man of a publick Spirit, and great generoſity, ſo that his Family was rather impoveriſhed than enriched by his advancement to the Papal Authority. He was a Perſon not ambitious or deſirous of the vain glory of this World, of which that he might give a teſtimony at his death, he forbad his Relations to raiſe any magnificent Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in recommendation of him to poſterity, leaving behind him ſome few words for a ſhort Epitaph to be inſcribed on the Marble, which was to cover him; which were ſcarce ſufficient to denote the Character by which he was to be known and recommended to Poſterity: to ſupply which his Succeſſour <hi>Clement</hi> X. at the deſire of the Publick, and in gratitude to the memory of his deceaſed Friend and Benefactor inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed on the pedeſtal of a Pillar (which <hi>Clement</hi> IX. at the foot of the Bridg <hi>Aelius</hi> had repaired at his own charge) a brief Narrative of his life; and having likewiſe erected a ſtately Monument with his Statue thereupon in the Church of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> he adorned it with this Inſcription:

This Pope being dead was generally lamented by all People of what Degree, or Nation, or Quality ſoever: for he was of a moſt gentle and eaſie temper, delightful and pleaſant in his Converſation, and ſtudied ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely the welfare of the Church, without much regard to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Family: in his Diet he was very abſtemious, and lived much after the faſhion of the Primitive Chriſtians. He was ever zealous of a good correſpondence with Kings and Princes ſubjected to the Papal Sea, and always endeavoured to reconcile them one to the other; as appears by
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:50681:405"/>
his endeavours at <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> where a Peace was concluded between the two Crowns of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> And when the difference aroſe between the Queen Regent, and <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> he interpoſed in ſuch manner by his Nuntio Cardinal <hi>Borromeo,</hi> that with much ſucceſs he reconciled matters, and diverted a ſtorm which might have engaged <hi>Spain</hi> in ruinous troubles.</p>
               <p>Though this Pope from the humility of his Spirit, was not very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to raiſe Columns of his own praiſe, or engraven Inſcriptions like other Popes on every fair Marble, that was erected in the moſt publick and conſpicuous places of the City: yet the People of <hi>Rome</hi> did volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, and of their own accord ſupply ſeveral Euloges to the honour of his memory, of which we ſhall add this one, which is worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed; for being engraven in the <hi>Area</hi> of the Capitol on the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Arch of <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> being a compariſon of this Pope with that Emperour in theſe words:</p>

                  <hi>Chigi</hi> to ſtrengthen his Party made his addreſſes to the <hi>French,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending great ſervices for that Crown; and in the mean time deſpiſed the intereſt of the <hi>Flying Squadron:</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Scion,</hi> being then arrived from <hi>France</hi> in quality of Ambaſſadour, made ſcorn of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of <hi>Chigi,</hi> ſo ſoon as he diſcovered his practices with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards:</hi> and indeed his double dealing abated much of his reputation in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> where he might have formed a ſtrong Party, had not his ambition to become ſole Arbitrator weakened his Intereſt, and brought all his words, and actions under a ſuſpition.</p>
               <p>This Opinion of <hi>Chigi</hi> gave a beginning to a Combination between <hi>Barberino, Roſpiglioſi,</hi> and the <hi>Flying Squadron</hi>; which ſtrong Parties ſtanding in oppoſition each to other, fifty days were paſſed without any effect, and ſo reſolved were <hi>Chigi,</hi> and <hi>Barberino,</hi> that one ſaid, <hi>He would eat Cherries, and the other Figs in the Conclave</hi>; with which ſayings, all Parties growing warm, Cardinal <hi>Eſte</hi> declared openly with excluſion againſt <hi>Chigi, Retz</hi> againſt <hi>Medici,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King againſt <hi>Elci</hi>; with which <hi>Medici</hi> growing angry replied, that if <hi>France</hi> excluded <hi>Elci,</hi> that <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould do the like by <hi>Vidoni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Factions daily increaſing, and new difficulties ariſing, <hi>Chigi</hi> and <hi>Medici</hi> the two great ſticklers in the <hi>Conclave</hi> grew more calm, and leſs concerned for thoſe, whom they had once deſigned to promote; and to make appear how diſintereſted they were, put every Perſon, that was qualified, into ſome hopes of being choſen.

Which conſiderations being weighty, and prevalent with the <hi>Conclave,</hi> his excluſion was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly declared.</p>
               <p>After which every one was at a ſtand, and in expectation of what time and the power of <hi>Barberino,</hi> and others would produce. <hi>Chigi</hi> had laboured to the utmoſt of his power to advance one of his Friends; but all proving ineffectual, he gave them at leaſt the ſatisfaction, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had been wanting on his part. <hi>Medici</hi> was well contented with the excluſion of <hi>Nerli,</hi> who was a Creature of <hi>Roſpiglioſi,</hi> becauſe <hi>Altieri,</hi> who was under the ſame notion of a Friend, and dependant on that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, was ſtill in nomination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:50681:406"/>In the mean time the aged Cardinals zealous for the honour, and ſanctity of the <hi>Conclave,</hi> exclaimed againſt the delatory proceedings, which gave ſcandal to the World, and cauſe of complaint to the People, who by reaſon thereof were impoveriſhed by a deadneſs of Trade, and oppreſſed by the extortions of the <hi>Mons Pietatis,</hi> which during the vacancy of the Sea, exacted four times more from indigent Perſons, than the known rates allowed by Law, and the juſtice of the Popes.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain</hi> more concerned than any other for theſe delays, having Audience in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> requeſted the Cardinals in the name of his Maſter to agree in their Election: for whereas they had an Authority free and independent of temporal Crowns, and ſecular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, they were obliged to proceed in the ſpeedy choice of a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and of a Paſtor to the Univerſal Church, and not ſuffer the ſame to become ſubſervient to Intrigues and private Intereſts; which as they were daily more ſcandalous, they gave occaſion to the World of diſcourſe, as if the inſpirations of the Holy Ghoſt were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the <hi>Conclave,</hi> the divine Illuminations damped, and eclipſed by the interpoſition of Secular deſigns.</p>
               <p>It was ſtrange to obſerve, how on a ſudden after this diſcourſe, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the <hi>Conclave</hi> was altered: the old Cardinals weary of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint would yield to the Election of any, provided, they might gain their liberty; and the young Men were ready to give their ſuffrages for whomſoever the Leaders of their Party, and Intereſt ſhould direct: ſo that now merit, and Vertue, and experience in Government were laid aſide and a Pope choſen by thoſe who were moſt obſtinate, and tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of their Opinion, and could hold out longeſt.</p>
               <p>Thus different Intereſts began to agree; and <hi>Chigi</hi> and <hi>Medici</hi> to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſcourſe with <hi>Barberino,</hi> propoſing to pitch upon the Creature, or favourite of the Houſe of <hi>Roſpiglioſi,</hi> to which both theſe leading Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were well inclined: the Perſon nominated was Cardinal <hi>Emilio Altieri</hi> generally grateful to the whole <hi>Conclave,</hi> for his great Age, having paſſed the years of eighty: <hi>Chigi</hi> took occaſion hereupon to complement <hi>Barberino,</hi> declaring, that rather by divine Inſpiration, than humane fanſie, he had fixed on the ſole Perſon of the World, whom he had reſerved in his breaſt as the moſt worthy of this Dignity, for that he was a Man who never concerned himſelf in embroils, and Intrigues of different Parties; never was a Penſioner of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the favour of <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, or was obliged by any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Families. <hi>Barberino</hi> on the other ſide, vowed, that the nomination he had made of <hi>Altieri,</hi> was rather an effect of his good wiſhes towards <hi>Chigi,</hi> than to his own Family: for that he was not ignorant of the great Obligations, which Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi</hi> the Creature of <hi>Emilio Altieri</hi> had unto him, by whoſe means onely he was firſt preferred to be Auditor of the <hi>Camera,</hi> then to be a Prelate, and laſtly to be a Cardinal; all which were ſuch good Offices, as would certainly oblige <hi>Altieri</hi> in caſe that to the preceding kindneſſes which he had performed towards his Favourite he ſhould add, that alſo of being an Inſtrument to advance himſelf unto the Papacy.</p>
               <p>In the mean time great Intereſts were made for <hi>Odeſcalchi,</hi> and his Party was ſo earneſt thereupon, that they deſigned ſecretly to elect him by Acceſſion, as a more ready way than by Treaties, or making Parties.
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:50681:407"/>
But <hi>Barberino</hi> was zealous for <hi>Altieri,</hi> and inſtant to have his Election paſſed without other diſpute, or conſideration. Howſoever <hi>Chigi</hi> was a little wavering, becauſe he doubted, whither <hi>Paluzzi</hi> would prove conſtant to him, and bear him the ſame reſpect in the time of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and under the circumſtances of the Pope's favour as he had te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified to him in his former condition of fortune: wherefore that he might ſecure him the better, he addreſſed himſelf to <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> perſuading him to believe, that his endeavours for the promotion of <hi>Altieri,</hi> were in a great meaſure founded on that friendſhip, and good will which he owed to him; and for that reaſon before he would engage his Party and Intereſt in his Election, he would be aſſured that <hi>Altieri</hi> ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to adopt <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> and create him Cardinal Nephew, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more juſt and due to a Perſon of his Wiſdom, and Talents, and practiſed in all Affairs of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Having ſaid thus much, <hi>Chigi</hi> conducted <hi>Paluzzi</hi> to <hi>Medici,</hi> and they together with <hi>Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> and <hi>Barberino</hi> went to the lodging of <hi>Altieri</hi>; to whom the Dean Cardinal <hi>Barberino</hi> with a loud Voice, and profound reverence made the ſame Complements, as were accuſtomary to Popes elect: with which <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri</hi> being ſurpriz'd, made Anſwer with tears in his Eyes, <hi>That he was unfit for the performance of ſo great a function, which might more eaſily be ſuſtained by any of their Eminencies than by himſelf,</hi> and pointing to Cardinal <hi>Brancacci: Behold,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Man, whoſe Virtues, Godlineſs, and Abilities have rendered worthy of this high Exaltation.</hi> By this time the Cell, or Lodging was filled with Cardinals, who with one Voice, (two onely excepted) proclaimed <hi>Altieri</hi> Pope on the twenty eighth day of <hi>April,</hi>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 1670.</note> and having performed the uſual Ceremonies of Adoration, and other matters practiſed at the Election of Popes; he took the name of <hi>Clement</hi> X. to the great joy and ſatisfaction of the People of <hi>Rome</hi>; who praiſed God for having given them a Prince choſen from the number of their own Patricians, who was of a gentle and placid nature and temper, and grateful to all the Princes of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Pope now <hi>Clement</hi> X. was born at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. and in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> V. was firſt admited into Eccleſiaſtical Orders. <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. teſtified a high eſteem for his Perſon, and recommending him to his Nephew <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. diſpeeded him into <hi>Poland</hi> with the charge of Auditor to the Nuntio; and after his return conſtituted him Governour of <hi>Loretto,</hi> and of all the <hi>Marca,</hi> and laſtly of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> to which he added the Biſhoprick of <hi>Camerino. Innocent</hi> X. ſent him his Nuntio unto <hi>Naples,</hi> where he reſided, at the time when <hi>Maſanello</hi> made an inſurrection of the People. Whilſt the Sea was vacant by the death of <hi>Innocent</hi> X. the College of Cardinals gave him a Commiſſion to treat with the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and with the Governour of <hi>Milan. Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> VII. ſo ſoon as he was promoted to the Papal Dignity, made him Secretary of the ſacred Congregation of Biſhops and Regulars; and had therewith conferred on him the dignity of Cardinal, had not ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were emulous of his worth, prevented the good intentions of the Pope towards him. But <hi>Clement</hi> IX. having received ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his Abilities by a long courſe of Services to the Church, made him Chief of his Bed-Chamber, and on the 29th. of <hi>November</hi> 1669. promoted him to the dignity of Cardinal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:50681:407"/>The firſt action performed by this Pope, after his Election was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi</hi> his Nephew by Adoption, obliging him to take the name of <hi>Altieri,</hi> and the Arms of his Family; which were ſix Stars Argent in an <hi>Azure</hi> Field; the which he performed in ſo much haſte, that before he deſcended from the ſtairs of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> he embraced his new Nephew, and publiſhed his Title before all the College; he alſo declared Signior <hi>Carpegna</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> to be <hi>Datario</hi> then already Auditor of the <hi>Rota,</hi> and <hi>Frederick Borromeo</hi> to be Secretary of State; the which are the three greateſt Offices, and preferments in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But nothing occaſioned ſo much diſcourſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> as the choice and adoption of <hi>Paluzzi</hi> into the Family of <hi>Altieri</hi>; to which he had no other Relation, than that his Nephew <hi>Don Gaſparo Paluzzi</hi> was married to <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Laura Altieri</hi> Niece to the Pope. The Politicians, and ſpeculative Men of <hi>Rome,</hi> who undertake to prognoſticate ſtrange events of things from ſmall and inconſiderable matters, formed diverſe Judgments on this new Adoption. Some reflecting on the poverty of the Houſe of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzzi,</hi> which was greatly indebted; and on the humour of the Cardinal who had employed his whole Eſtate in purchaſing Offices, and was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous in his nature; (as moſt <hi>Romans</hi> are) did conclude, that the Court would be inclined to a ſordid Parſimony, the Officers mercenary, and all Benefices ſet to ſale in a manner as ſcandalouſly Simoniacal, as they were in the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> X. But others framing a more charitable Opinion of <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> believed, that he conſidering himſelf no other than as an adopted Nephew, from whom the World expects a gentle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment, would contain himſelf within narrower terms of modeſty than Nephews of the natural bloud to whom Men with leſs envy allow more freedom, and licentiouſneſs in their actions; and that calling to mind the fate of Cardinal <hi>Aſtalli</hi> adopted into the Family of <hi>Pamfilio,</hi> would ſerve himſelf of that Example, to govern in all the exerciſes of his Power. On the other ſide, ſome reflecting on the old Age of the Pope, who was entered into a Station of Life, which inclined to repoſe, and freedom from turbulent thoughts, imagined, that the Pope would caſt all his cares, and troubles into the hands of his ſuppoſed Nephew, who conſidering the life of this <hi>Clement,</hi> which according to the courſe of Nature could not be of long continuance, would make uſe of his time and amaſs Riches after the Example of the <hi>Ludiviſi,</hi> who were of the Kindred of <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. and had in the ſpace of two years ſo well impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their fortunes, that beſides immenſe ſums of ready Money, which they had accumulated and heaped up, they had alſo erected many ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous Palaces, and purchaſed Lands, Mannors and Seignories, by means of evil Arts well known to the World.</p>
               <p>Thus every one framed his Predictions of the event of matters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own conceit and fanſie; the truth of which was ſoon il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by the Negotiations of <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> (whom for the future, we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to call by the name of Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi>) for now to give the firſt Eſſay of his Power and management, it was obſerved, that when the Pope (as is uſual at the time of Coronation) received Memorials, and granted Favours, and Benefices to ſeveral Petitioners, ſuch graces ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freely given, and accepted with a thankful mind; until the Grants coming to be executed, <hi>Altieri</hi> gave an unexpected ſtop to them, denying them to paſs the Seal; on pretence, that the Pope was ſurprized
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:50681:408"/>
and ill informed, or had paſſed them to others before for want of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, incident to old Age; by which Artifice this good Cardinal diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of all Offices, Benefices, and places of Truſt, according to his own pleaſure, which was always regulated by the rules of greateſt Profit. Though this early manner of Negotiation made a noiſe, and cauſed great murmuring at Court; yet <hi>Altieri</hi> continuing firm to his Principles, and to the method which he had chalked out unto himſelf, gave expreſs Orders to the Maſter of the Pope's Chamber, and to all the Attendants near his Perſon, not to admit of any Addreſſes, or ſuffer Petitions to be preſented to the Pope without his knowledg and permiſſion; ſo that the Pope ſeemed to be (as it were) beſieged in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> and ſerve onely for a Cipher, or a property to <hi>Altieri,</hi> and remain as a Statue without Eyes, or Ears. This manner of dealing gave occaſion to many witty Men at <hi>Rome</hi> (according to their cuſtom) to publiſh <hi>Paſquils</hi> (which we call Libels) one of which was affixed on the Pope's Picture, hanging over the door of his Bed-Chamber, and was this, <hi>Qui ſlô,</hi> per <hi>Inſegna,</hi> that is, I am here for a Sign; alluding to the perſon of the Pope, who ſerved onely for a ſhadow, whileſt <hi>Altieri</hi> governed all with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotical Power. In like manner they affixed a Paper at the door of <hi>Altie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> with this Inſcription: <hi>To the moſt Eminent Cardinal Signor</hi> Paluzzi Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri, <hi>by title</hi> Cardinal Patron, <hi>but in reality Pope himſelf.</hi> Another of like nature was affixed at the Pope's Chamber door: To His Holineſs <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> X. our Lord, and Prince, living under the tuition of Cardinal <hi>Altieri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the eleventh of <hi>May</hi> after his Election, he was Crown'd in S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Church with the uſual Ceremonies; three days after which, he held a private Conſiſtory, whereat he returned thanks individually to every Cardinal for his good will, and ſuffrage at his Election: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Politicks of former Popes, he made ſome Laws, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for regulation of the Markets, and for ſupplies of the City with Victuals, and Proviſions, that the People might at the beginning of his Government, find Peace and plenty.</p>
               <p>But theſe plauſible, and ſpecious appearances which coſt little to the Pope, great diſcontents aroſe in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by reaſon of the exorbitant Power of the Cardinal Nephew; who aſſuming all matters into his own hands, ſuffered no applications to be made unto the Pope but by his means, and interceſſion: nor would he ſuffer the Seals to paſs for any Livings, or Benefices without a payment of Mony for and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration thereof unto himſelf, in which he was ſo ſtrict, that a Living of ten Crowns a year did not eſcape him without ſome acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And for better management of this Simonaical Traffick, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Brokers in the Palace to ſet up an Office, and there publickly to profeſs and without ſhame, to bargain, and contract for Offices and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices. This ſcandalous manner of dealing diſcouraged all Men of Virtue and Merit, from hopes of obtaining Employments, for ſince Money, and not Deſert, was the ſtep to all preferments, good Men for the greateſt part were excluded, and none but a ſort of progging, and traffiquing Clergymen advanced to Benefices and Places of Truſt.</p>
               <p>Thus did this adopted Nephew play his part, when a great ſwarm of Kindred appeared at Court, pretending to be allied either by bloud, or alliance to the Pope: for though when he was onely a ſimple Prelat, and had no great matter to diſpoſe of, few or none would own his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:50681:408"/>
but being now advanced to the Pontifical Chair every Citizen of <hi>Rome</hi> would be his Kinſman, and frame a Scheme, or Tree of his Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, deducing their linage by one Branch, or other from the Family of <hi>Altieri:</hi> all which finding an adopted Nephew ſurreptitiouſly crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the favour of their Kinſman, and themſelves excluded, openly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> and complained of the injuſtice and ill fortune: but he little regarded their clamours, ſuffering none of them to approach the Pope, or challenge kindred, unleſs the Family of the <hi>Maſſimi,</hi> of which he advanced ſome to Places of Truſt and Profit.</p>
               <p>The College of Cardinals, though much divided in their inclinations, yet the greateſt part of them could not ſupport the deſpotical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Altieri</hi>; who though he could not abſolutely reſtrain the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals from acceſs to the Pope; yet he made their Audiences difficult to be obtained, and often cauſed them (upon I know not what excuſes) to be deferred until other days, and times, when he contrived to be always preſent, that he might be a witneſs of their diſcourſes, and prevent that freedom, which they deſigned with the Pope.</p>
               <p>This deſign of Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> was greatly promoted by the retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Perſons powerful for their Riches and Intereſt from <hi>Rome:</hi> for ſoon after the Election of the Pope; the Ambaſſadour of the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, and the Cardinals of <hi>Retz</hi> and <hi>Boglion</hi> were returned into <hi>France,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>de Eſte,</hi> whoſe Power was ſufficient to ſhake the mightieſt Favourite, was gone into his own Country: Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> was ſick, and languiſhing in his Bed; and the <hi>Flying Squadron</hi> whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences were onely pure zeal for the univerſal good of the Church, were contented to let matters paſs according to the humour of <hi>Altieri,</hi> hoping that the Pope by reaſon of his age could not hold out long; and that therefore it were better to employ their time in forming Parties againſt the next <hi>Conclave,</hi> than to contrive means and Artifices to defeat and ruin the Power of <hi>Altieri</hi>; but they were much deceived in their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, for the good old Man was ſo luſty and hearty, living without much care, that he was likely to out-live the youngeſt of the <hi>Squadron.</hi> Nor was the Marquis of <hi>Aſtorgas</hi> Ambaſſadour for <hi>Spain</hi> much more concerned than others, for he having other deſigns of gaining the good will and favour of the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> little cared in what nanner the Intrigues and Affairs of the Court ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the onely dangerous, and formidable Enemy was the Dean Cardinal <hi>Barberino,</hi> a perſon of that Reputation, and Wit as was only capable to ſtand in competition with the Power of <hi>Altieri.</hi> But neither his Policy, Art, nor Intereſt could be available againſt this Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Nephew, who exerciſed a more abſolute Power than any other Favourite had enjoyed in the Place before him; the continuance of which being very uncertain, he caſt about him divers ways, whereby to advance and eſtabliſh the greatneſs of his Family, which under the happy circumſtances of his preſent flouriſhing condition, was not difficult to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure. For in <hi>Rome</hi> there are many Noble and rich Families, which aſpire to an alliance with the kindred of the Pope's Regnant; which though it be an honour of no long continuance, yet they have commonly had the opportunity to accumulate Riches during the life of the Pope, and afterwards remained with the priviledg of being numbred amongſt the Princes after his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:50681:409"/>The Prince <hi>Carbognano,</hi> who was a principal branch of the Houſe of <hi>Colonna</hi> (which for its Power, Riches, and Nobility yields to none in <hi>Rome</hi>) had two Sons, the eldeſt of which was called the Duke of <hi>Baſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello,</hi> and the ſecond Duke of <hi>Anticoli,</hi> the firſt was married to the Siſter of the Conteſtable <hi>Colonna</hi>; but having no Children, or Heirs, the Riches, and opulency of all that Family was to devolve by right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to the Duke of <hi>Anticoli</hi>; of which Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> having well conſidered, treated of a marriage between him, and <hi>Donna Tarquinia</hi> Great Niece to the Pope, eſteeming it the beſt and moſt advantageous Match in all <hi>Rome.</hi> Prince <hi>Carbognano,</hi> the Father, who was of an open and eaſie temper, gave ear to the Propoſal with much ſatisfaction; but the Duke of <hi>Baſanello,</hi> not ſuffering his younger Brother to be advanced by theſe means to a degree above himſelf, refuſed to give his aſſent unto the Match, unleſs he alſo might be received into en equal rank with his Brother, and enjoy the honour of thoſe prerogatives, which appertain to Nephews, and Princes allied to the Papal Throne. <hi>Altieri</hi> declining all rubs, and difficulties which might obſtruct the Match entertained <hi>Baſanel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> with hopes and expectations of the conditions he deſired: but ſo ſoon as the Marriage was celebrated and conſummated; he then excuſed himſelf, ſaying, that upon better thoughts, he found, that ſuch an inſtance could not be given without drawing many ill conſequences with it; howſoever, that the Pope would think upon it, and do what was poſſible; but in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſuch words gave no ſatisfaction, being interpreted for a flat and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat denial.</p>
               <p>Hence at firſt aroſe ſome coldneſs, which afterwards proceeded to an open quarrel, and defiance between <hi>Baſanello</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>Altieri,</hi> and <hi>Anticoli</hi> on the other: ſo that both parties exerciſed their thoughts in ways of revenge upon each other. The genius of <hi>Italians,</hi> which is naturally ready in ſuch contrivances, prompted <hi>Baſanello</hi> to a matter wherein he might moſt ſenſibly wound <hi>Altieri</hi>; for knowing that the expectation of Riches was the ſole aim and deſire of the Cardinal; he laboured to diſappoint his hopes, by defeating his Brother <hi>Anticoli</hi> of all that Eſtate which deſcended to him by the death of the Prince <hi>Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano,</hi> which amounted unto three thouſand Piſtols a year beſides Plate, Jewels and other Riches; and were bequeathed to <hi>Baſanello,</hi> and at his abſolute diſpoſal, without regard to any deſcendency: but that ſo much Riches might not be loſt, or be alienated from the Family of <hi>Colonna,</hi> he ſettled them upon the Duke of <hi>Sonnino</hi> Brother of his Wife, and of the Conſtable <hi>Colonna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This unexpected defeat to the prejudice of <hi>Anticoli,</hi> touched <hi>Altieri</hi> in the moſt ſenſible part, which was his own intereſt and honour; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of which he contrived a Revenge ſpun with a like thread, and of the ſame nature with the former; in which becauſe moſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Princes, and forein Miniſters were concerned, it may not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to this Hiſtory to make a ſhort relation thereof.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Ceſarini</hi> lately deceaſed, had left immenſe Riches to his Family; but wanting Heirs male, and leaving only two Daughters, the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance deſcended to Monſignor <hi>Ceſarini</hi> Brother to the Prince, who was Clerk of the <hi>Camera</hi>; which to enjoy with ſo many Seignories, Baronies, and Lordſhips thereunto belonging this good Prelat made no ſcruple to abandon his Offices, and the expectations of a Cardinals Cap to enter
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:50681:409"/>
into a fair Revenue of above ſixteen thouſand Piſtols <hi>per annum</hi>; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving waſted his body by the ſins of his youth, he found himſelf not fit to marry and conſequently without hopes of legitimate Heirs: for which reaſon, theſe Riches deſcending to the two Daughters, the Prince their Father left in his Will and Teſtament, that ſuch, as ſhould have the fortune to marry his Daughters, ſhould be perſons devoted, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely adhering to the party, and intereſt of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Sonnino</hi> formerly called Abbat of <hi>Colonna,</hi> and Brother of the Conſtable had forſaken his Eccleſiaſtical preferment to marry with the ſecond Daughter, on condition that the eldeſt, engaging herſelf by promiſe to be a Nun, ſhould renounce all right and title to the moiety of the Eſtate with her younger Siſter.</p>
               <p>The condition of this Affair being known to <hi>Altieri,</hi> he took his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to reek his revenge on the Houſe of <hi>Colonna,</hi> judging it a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to pay them off in the ſame coin; for as the Duke of <hi>Baſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello</hi> had formerly defeated <hi>Anticoli</hi> of the Eſtate of Prince <hi>Gallicano</hi>; ſo now he contrived to deprive <hi>Sonnino</hi> of the Inheritance belonging to the Princeſs <hi>Ceſarini,</hi> and which ſhould inevitably have devolved unto him, in caſe the Princeſs had remained conſtant to her reſolution, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the World, within the incloſures of a Nunnery. But <hi>Altieri</hi> ſuggeſting to the young Lady the pleaſures, and conveniencies of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage made eaſie impreſſion into her frail heart, cauſing her to waver and ſtagger in her late reſolutions: and whereas the Vow ſhe had made of perpetual chaſtity, was the chief ſcruple which obſtructed the change of her Will; that knot was eaſily untied by the ſolution of her ſpiritual Father and Confeſſor, and other Prieſts, and Friers, who were made the Inſtruments of this deſign; and in caſe there ſhould ſtill remain any ſcruple of Conſcience, the infallible power of the Pope himſelf was at hand to clear the doubts, and diſpenſe with all the Engagements, Vows and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to God, or Man, by which ſhe ſuppoſed herſelf bound and obliged, and to make all this good, the Pope proffered to take her into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
               <p>The Princeſs <hi>Ceſarini</hi> being thus overcome, and reſolved to marry, the Cardinal provided her with a Husband, giving her the opportunity to ſee <hi>Don Frederico Sforza</hi> his Nephew, who was a brisk young Gallant, and capable to make impreſſion in the tender heart of a Lady diſpoſed towards the thoughts of marriage. The Conſtable of <hi>Colonna</hi> on the other ſide deſpairing of all hopes to perſuade the Princeſs to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of her Vow, concurred with the other party in his aſſent to her marriage, provided ſhe would accept of <hi>Don Lelio Orſini.</hi> This Propoſal much alarm'd the Cardinal, as alſo the Duke of <hi>Gravina,</hi> who though he was one branch of the Houſe of <hi>Orſini,</hi> yet having married one of the Pope's Nieces with a conſiderable Portion in ready Mony, and with aſſurances of a Cardinal's Cap for his Brother, (who was a <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Frier) was eaſily perſuaded to concur with <hi>Altieri</hi> in the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pope's Family. The Intrigues of this Affair were various, and admitted of more particulars than are required in this Hiſtory; but in ſhort, the power of <hi>Altieri</hi> was not onely ſuperiour to that of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lonna,</hi> and his plots more ſubtle, and his labours more indefatigable; (for he was the moſt aſſiduous Man in the World to promote his own intereſt) but alſo he had a greater Aſcendant over the affections of
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:50681:410"/>
the Princeſs, in the perſon of <hi>Sforza,</hi> who was young, gentle, and of good addreſs, whereas <hi>Don Lelio</hi> was a Man in years, and of a weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm complexion, and ſo given over and inclined to devotion, that they gave him the name of <hi>Mangia Santi,</hi> or the Saint-Eater, wholly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely applying his mind to gain Indulgences, and Jubilies, and Pardons: howſoever upon the propoſals of this Marriage, he ſtrained his humour into the Mode of a Gallant, feigning a brisk and aiery behaviour, which being forced, and affected became him ſo ill, that it ſeemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ridiculous, and could ſtand in no competition with the more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral garb and comelineſs of <hi>Don Frederico.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Howſoever the Intereſt which was made in behalf of <hi>Don Lelio</hi> by importunity of the Mother, and the perſuaſion of other Friends, was ſo prevalent that the young Lady remained in a doubtful condition, which of the offers ſhe ſhould embrace. This indifferency much troubled <hi>Altie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi>; and therefore to ſecure his point againſt all attempts and affaults of the Mother, and others; he removed the Princeſs from the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Katharine</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> wherein ſhe reſided, to that of S. <hi>Anne</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Tiber,</hi> where <hi>Sforza</hi> had an Aunt that lived a profeſs'd Nun: and for better ſecurity from ſecret practices, Guards were ſet by expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Pope to hinder all communication with the Princeſs. But not onely was it thought neceſſary to prevent all private ſuggeſtions; but the affection of the Lady towards <hi>Sforza</hi> was to be kept up by ſome lively repreſentations of Love, which were conſtantly to be inſtilled into her mind by ſome able and proper Inſtrument: to perform this Office, none ſeemed more able, nor better qualified than Monſignor <hi>Altoviti</hi> the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch of <hi>Alexandria</hi>; who was highly eſteemed in the City, and of great reputation for the devotion and ſanctity of his life, and for the experience he had in the affairs of the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> moreover, he was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent over this Convent of St. <hi>Anne,</hi> and lived in hopes of being a Cardinal, and of other promotions in the Eccleſiaſtical State, ſo that no perſon could be more proper for this Employment, than this good Prelat.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Princeſs thus remained cloſely watched, and beſieged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Convent; the Family of <hi>Colonna</hi> murmured, and talked loud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cardinal, complaining of his injuſtice and inſolent violence which was intolerable to Princes of <hi>Rome:</hi> but ſay what they could, <hi>Altieri</hi> was reſolved to hold his prey faſt, and improve his Intereſt with her by means of the good Prelat <hi>Altoviti</hi>; who having the care and protection of that Convent committed to his care and Truſt, had the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity without much ſuſpition to make frequent Viſits to the Lady, and to carry Billiets from her to the Cardinal, declaring her reſolution to be entirely governed by him and his Holineſs. But this daily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and intercourſe of Letters had not long continued, before the Spies of <hi>Colonna</hi> had diſcovered the Intrigues, which were managed by this Prelat, and the Aunt of <hi>Don Frederico,</hi> who alſo was as ſubtle as any Woman, and the more cunning for being a Nun. The Conſtable of <hi>Colonna</hi> and others of that Family being well informed of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and of all theſe affairs, diſſembled them by a more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpect to the perſon of <hi>Altoviti,</hi> whom, whenſoever they met, they ſaluted with ſuch profound reverence, as if he had been Pope, profeſſing more than ordinary reſpect to his perſon, and ſanctity of his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:50681:410"/>The good Prelat believing theſe demonſtrations of kindneſs to be all real, openly paſſed over the Bridg of Saint <hi>Siſto</hi> without fear, or ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the ſight and view of the Lords of <hi>Colonna</hi>; when ſome bold Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians, or Aſſaſſinates aſſaulted him in his Coach firing two Carbines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, one of which ſhot him with a Bullet, which paſſed his Neck, and came out under his ſhoulder: the poor Prelat finding himſelf thus mortally wounded cryed out for help; at which lamentable Voice many Prieſts and Friers came about him, to prepare him for death; but Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions coming in, and finding that the wound was not mortal, he took courage, and in a few weeks his wound was perfectly cured. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident afforded matter of diſcourſe to the whole Town, and Libels or <hi>Paſquils</hi> were ſcattered, and affixed in all publick places: others wrote Verſes and Elegies on <hi>Altoviti,</hi> as if he had been already dead; of which we ſhall only repeat this Diſtick:
<q>Barbare! quid violas violento tingere tentas Sanguine? quas tingi Murice Roma dabat.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This violent attempt on the ſacred perſon of a Prelat was ſcandalous to all the World; and every one believed that the Pope would have ſo highly reſented it, as in deſpight of the Family of <hi>Colonna,</hi> and of their greatneſs, have revenged an Act ſo infamous, as this, by juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Offenders: but contrary to all expectation, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Rome</hi> went to the Pope's Palace to receive Orders, in what manner to govern himſelf in this important Affair; the Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> ſeemed very cold and remiſs, giving little or no encouragement, or dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Magiſtrates to examine, or enquire into the matter, ſaying, <hi>That Officers of Juſtice ought as well to be Politicians, as Judges.</hi> In the mean time the Conſtable <hi>Colonna</hi> ſeemed little concerned, and neither gave outward demonſtrations of joy, nor affected a diſſembled ſorrow; but reſerving himſelf in a moderate mean, appeared publickly at Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, <hi>Operaes,</hi> and other divertiſements, as uſual; nouriſhing a ſecret contentment, that he had revenged himſelf on his Adverſary, and that his power, and greatneſs had ſeated him above the reach of the Cardinal. On the other ſide, the Cardinal rejoyced to hear <hi>Colonna</hi> evil ſpoken of, and that he had incurred the Odium, or hatred of all the good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Men of <hi>Rome,</hi> and eſpecially of the Clergy; and farther to dilate and heap an infamy of this deteſtable Act on a Family which he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; he cauſed a Narrative thereof to be wrote and ſent unto all Courts, and Countries, by ſuch Pens as he had choſen and cauſed to be dipped in the moſt bitter Ink of Invectives.</p>
               <p>This was all the ſatisfaction that <hi>Altoviti</hi> could obtain, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſacredneſs of his Perſon, being a Prelat, and Patriarch, and one that had ſacrificed his reputation and life for ſervice of the Court. And though the Nephews of other Popes have on occaſions leſs injurious and diſhonourable to the Papal Sea, hazarded the quiet and ſafety of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical State; yet <hi>Aliteri,</hi> ſcorning to inſiſt on ſuch low, and trivial punctillios delighted himſelf with the thoughts, that in deſpight of all the power and contrivances of <hi>Colonna,</hi> he ſhould gain his point and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently mortifie that Family by the marriage of <hi>Sforza</hi> with the Princeſs <hi>Ceſarini.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:50681:411"/>And indeed the matter ſucceeded accordingly; for after all theſe, and many other particulars, which cauſed diſturbance; the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour who was the Duke <hi>de Eſtreé,</hi> and the Duke <hi>Ceſarini</hi> Uncle of the two Ladies interpoſed between both parties, and in fine made this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That both Siſters with their Husbands ſhould live under the protection of <hi>France</hi> (as determined by the Will of their Father) and ever more profeſs and adhere to that Intereſt. That their Uncle <hi>Ceſarini</hi> who was infirm, and impotent in his Bed without hopes of poſterity, ſhould leave the Inheritance of his Eſtate to his two Nieces, to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided between them; Which terms of Accommodation being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented and ſubſcribed reciprocally by both Parties: the Cardinal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his ends, and the rage of <hi>Colonna</hi> appeaſed, and Prince <hi>Sonnino</hi> ſatisfied, who had married the younger Siſter upon the Promiſes, and Vows which the Elder had given to renounce the World, and the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and live within the retirement of a Convent.</p>
               <p>Thus ended the embroils of this Intrigue, injurious to none, but poor <hi>Altoviti</hi>; which having been acted in other parts, might have produced many Tragical Effects; but in regard the Scene was at <hi>Rome,</hi> where love and juſtice give way to Policy, and to deſigns for conſervation of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; Arms and paſſion were overcome by Plots and ſubtil Contrivances.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever matter occurred in the time of this Pope, we muſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the perſon, paſſion and conduct of <hi>Altieri</hi>; for <hi>Clement</hi> being an old Dotard, and not deſirous to be troubled with buſineſs, was ſerved by a Nephew, which fitted his humour, and only made uſe of his name and Authority to govern with an abſolute, and deſpotical Will. The firſt movement which regulated all his Actions was a paſſion, and an exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant deſire to agrandize his own Name and Family; and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as he was naturally partial to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, ſo he believed a conſtant adherence to that Intereſt to be moſt correſponding to thoſe deſigns.</p>
               <p>In the year 1671. four Cardinals died at <hi>Rome,</hi> of which <hi>Antonio Barberino</hi> was one. At <hi>Genoua</hi> new differences aroſe concerning the Inquiſition, which were afterwards compoſed to the mutual ſatisfaction both of the Pope, and that Republick. This year being the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after the Inauguration of the Pope, <hi>Don Pedro d' Aragon</hi> Vice-King of <hi>Naples</hi> appeared at <hi>Rome</hi> with a ſplendid Retinue, to perform the Embaſſy of Obedience (as they call it) which is done by the yearly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of a white Genet; this Ceremony was at other times performed by the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain</hi> reſiding at <hi>Rome,</hi> but to ſhew a greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour perhaps to the Pope, the Vice-King was qualified with the Title of <hi>Ambaſſadour Extraordinary</hi>; after whoſe return into <hi>Spain</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Aſtorgas</hi> was conſtituted Vice King of <hi>Naples,</hi> and Father <hi>Nitardo</hi> Inquiſitor-General of <hi>Spain</hi> was dignified with the Character of <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour</hi>; and becauſe that honour is inconſiſtent with the ſimple condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a religious perſon, the Pope adorned him with the Title of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Edeſſa</hi>: who the year following with ſeveral others was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the dignity of Cardinal.</p>

Howſoever that he might afford ſome teſtimonies of his care, and affection towards <hi>Poland</hi>; he raiſed the ſum of three hundred thouſand Crowns, by impoſitions on Eccleſiaſtical Benefices in <hi>Italy,</hi> of which he ſent fifty thouſand into <hi>Poland,</hi> and the remainder he inveſted in buildings, furniture and moveables for his own ſervice. Soon after which King <hi>Michael</hi> dying, the confuſions of that Kingdom increaſed, and ſo other Seditions and Controverſies amongſt them, was added that grand point of diſpute concerning a Succeſſour to the Crown; for conſervation of which, though <hi>Altieri</hi> was not ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as to contribute great ſums of Money; yet to pleaſe and gratifie the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he was deſirous to have a hand in the preferment of a King to them, naming Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorain</hi> as a perſon qualified with all Royal abilities, and endowments required in a King: and indeed though none was more worthy of a Crown, than that generous Prince: yet the Nobles of that Kingdom informed of the Pope's endeavours, reflected thereon, as prejudicial to their right of Election, having never received Kings at the nomination, or recommendation of <hi>Rome</hi>; and therefore proceeded to the election of <hi>John Sobieski,</hi> a perſon capable to ſuſtain a Crown to the benefit and glory of that Kingdom, which being invaded by the formidable Arms of the <hi>Turk,</hi> could never be reſcued from ruine, and deſtruction, but by the valour and fortune of <hi>Sobieski,</hi> whom God raiſed not onely for the protection of <hi>Poland,</hi> but for the defence of <hi>Germany</hi>; having by his Heroick march from his own Country in the year 1683. to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſignalized his Valour and proweſs, to ſuch a degree as Romances deſcribe Heroes, and the generous Actions and atchievements of mighty Princes.</p>

               <p>In this year the moſt Chriſtian King deſigned to reform the Order of St. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and caſt it into ſome other model; for that this Order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt worn out, and the conſtitutions of it, either abrogated or out of uſe; his Majeſty judged it more convenient to renew it again, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it upon ſome other foundation; and in purſuance of this reſolution a new Chief, or General was appointed for this Order. This right of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia</hi> or <hi>Jus Patronatus</hi> which his Majeſty had on this occaſion exerciſed in the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church greatly offended Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> who to vindicate the Papal Authority, in oppoſition to the King's uſurped pretences, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded a certain <hi>Gaſcon,</hi> who was come to ſeek preferment at <hi>Rome,</hi> to accept the honour of Abbat of the Order of St. <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and to qualifie him for this dignity, the Title of Abbat of <hi>Colombiere</hi> was conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. This ſimple <hi>Gaſcon,</hi> for no other would be ſo vain, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of an Employment ſo intrigueſom and difficult as this, not having the Talent, or capacity to manage an Affair of this weight and moment, ſigned and diſpatched away the Orders requiſite for regulation of his Abby; and though his friends and acquaintance diſſuaded him from an Enterpriſe ſo offenſive to the King; yet this bold <hi>Gaſcon</hi> perſiſted in his folly, being therein encouraged by the Creatures of <hi>Altieri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> then Ambaſſadour for <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented this pretence of the Pope in derogation to the Right of his Maſter, but more eſpecially was offended with the <hi>Gaſcon</hi> who had conſpired with the Cardinal to deprive the King of his Right and Prerogative. Wherefore the Duke being highly incenſed, ſeized the Scrivener who had drawn up the Abbat's Memorial to the Pope, and after ſevere words, and Reproofs cauſed him to be impriſoned: the Abbat in the mean time fearing the like treatment, retired into a priviledged place within the juriſdiction of the Pope's Palace, and under the protection of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, who allowed him a Penſion for his neceſſary maintenance. At length the Abbat inſtigated by his Friends, and encouraged by <hi>Altieri</hi> departed from <hi>Rome,</hi> and paſſed the <hi>Alps</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> where ſo ſoon as he was arrived, he was ſeiz'd by the King's command, and committed to Priſon, where we ſhall leave him to the Law, and the diſpoſal of the Order of St. <hi>Lazarus</hi> to the pleaſure of his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>This, and other diſcontents encreaſed the ill correſpondence between the Duke <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> and the Cardinal; which <hi>Altieri</hi> though an <hi>Italian</hi> could not conceal, or diſſemble; for being paſſionately affected to the Intereſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> received the news of the <hi>French</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and ſucceſſes againſt <hi>Holland</hi> with regret, and diſpleaſure; either diſapproving the intelligence as falſe, or otherwiſe relating it with ſuch circumſtances, as much abated, and eclipſed the glory of thoſe Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: all which ſerved to inflame the differences between the Duke and the Cardinal.</p>

The Farmers had often complained of theſe abuſes in the times of other Popes, and though many remedies, and expedients were propoſed for prevention of the Cheat; yet they produced no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides Affronts, and blows to the Officers.</p>
               <p>At length <hi>Altieri</hi> who eſteemed himſelf more politick, and powerful than all the Nephews of preceding Popes; reſolved on occaſion of the approaching Jubily to raiſe the Farm on proviſions to a more exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant price, than ever was known: and to obviate the complaints of the Cuſtomers; he publiſhed an Edict, That all Ambaſſadours and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals ſhould for the future pay the Taxes, and Impoſitions on their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick proviſions, in ſuch manner as all other perſons, not exempted by priviledges were obliged to pay.</p>
               <p>This Edict being publiſhed, greatly ſurprized, not only the Miniſters from forein Princes, but the whole College of Cardinals, who finding themſelves hereby deprived of their chief benefit and priviledg, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured, and talked loud againſt the arbitrary and irregular Government of Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi>; who little regarding the empty air of words, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned no other anſwer: than that <hi>the Pope was Maſter of his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and Dominions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadours then reſiding at <hi>Rome</hi> were the Cardinal <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe</hi> for the Emperour, the Duke <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Nitardo</hi> for <hi>Spain,</hi> beſides the Repreſentatives of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Grand Duke, <hi>Genoua,</hi> and other leſſer Princes, all theſe being diſobliged, and ſenſibly touched by the loſs, or ſuſpenſion of their priviledg, entered into conſultation together of the method, whereby to proceed; when after ſome debate they agreed to go together to the Palace of <hi>Monte Cavallo,</hi> where the Pope was then lodged; and there without any previous Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, or notice taken of the Cardinal Nephew to demand Audience immediately of the Pope. Accordingly theſe forein Miniſters being on their way thither, which made a great noiſe, and combuſtion in the City of <hi>Rome</hi>; the Cardinal at the alarm rouſed up himſelf, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly commanded the Chains of the City to be drawn, the Gates of the Palace to be ſhut, and Guards placed at all Avenues, to hinder and obſtruct the paſſage of the Ambaſſadours: who being in this manner diſappointed of their Audience returned home full of anger and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, reſolving in revenge of this Affront never more to acknowledg the Cardinal for Nephew of the Pope or treat with him under thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or give him the name of <hi>Altieri,</hi> but of <hi>Paluzzi</hi>; and in the mean time they cauſed a relation and ſtate of the whole matter to be drawn up
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:50681:413"/>
in writing, ſubſcribed by the hands of all the Ambaſſadours and forein Miniſters, the which was diſpatched by every one of them to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Prince.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the late Obſtructions given them by <hi>Altieri,</hi> the Ambaſſadours found a way to obtain Audience of the Pope, to whom having gained admittance, they repreſented, That the cauſe and ſubject of their diſcontent was the exorbitant and irregular Government of his Nephew, who to the prejudice of their honour had laid thoſe impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon them, from which they were exempted by the priviledg of their Character; and though both their Maſters, and themſelves were well-affected and zealous towards the Apoſtolical Sea, yet they could not but make a great difference between the duty they owed to his Holineſs, and their ſubmiſſion to the Cardinal <hi>Altieri</hi> in all his indirect proceedings. For Anſwer hereunto, the Pope, who was of a mild and gentle temper replied with his uſual ſoftneſs, in juſtification of his Edict, that the Debts which lay on the Apoſtolical Chamber were vaſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to many Millions of Gold; for eaſe of which, he was enforced to intrench for a ſhort time on their priviledges; which ſhould not longer continue, than until the end of the Jubily, which would be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated at the expiration of the following year; during which, the Chamber being obliged to more than ordinary charges, and expence, was enforced to exerciſe unuſual means for its reimburſments: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hoped, that they would become ſuch charitable Benefactors to the Church, as for its better ſupport, and ſubſiſtence to part with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their own rights for advancement of ſo great a good; eſpecially conſidering, that during the time of his Pontificate, the Eccleſiaſtical State had not been charged with any new Taxes, or Impoſitions.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like diſcourſes uſed by the Pope in favour of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and his proceedings, gave no ſatisfaction to the forein Miniſters; who therewith diſpleaſed, returned immediately from their Audience to their own dwellings, without the leaſt notice taken of the Cardinal Nephew; which neglect was intended as an affront to him, it being the cuſtom for Ambaſſadours after they came from Audience with the Pope, to viſit the Nephew, and communicate their Affairs to him, craving his aſſiſtance and furtherance in their buſineſs; but now the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to evidence their farther reſentments, judged it not only fit to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own <hi>Altieri</hi> by omiſſion of this Ceremony, but even (as far as they were able) to diveſt him of his Adoption, vouchſafing no other name to him, than that of <hi>Paluzzi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This neglect, and ill correſpondence with <hi>Altieri,</hi> continued for the ſpace of ſeveral months, which much abated the reſpect of the people towards the Cardinal, and cauſed him to fall low in the eſteem of the Court; and as a conſequence thereof Kings and Princes returned no Anſwer to his Letters, though accompanied with the Pope's Briefs, and worded with all the terms of ſubmiſſion, and humility, that could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. <hi>Altieri</hi> conſidering the circumſtances of his condition, and the age of the Pope, (who according to the courſe of Nature could not laſt long) endeavoured by all means poſſible to procure a good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between himſelf, and the Ambaſſadours, and eſpecially to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf right with <hi>France:</hi> in order hereunto a Congregation of Cardinals was deputed, conſiſting (as was believed) of Men diſintereſſed, and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:50681:414"/>
unbiaſſed by any faction, whoſe incumbence it was to propoſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive middle, and indifferent terms towards an accommodation. In like caſes, as well as in this, it hath been the practice, to ordain a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of this nature; which being compoſed for the moſt part of aged, and unactive Men, ſuch as had given over the World, moved ſlowly in all their determinations, and with that phlegm, that their Conſults, and Propoſals commonly concluded in nothing: the like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs this Deputation found, the meeting, and debates of the Cardinals being delayed from day to day without other iſſue, or effect, and in the mean time the execution of the Edict ſeemed to be ſuſpended, or to die of it ſelf; the Cuſtomers, and Collectors of the Taxes not daring to exerciſe their power in virtue of this Edict. <hi>Altieri</hi> alſo had given them ſome intimation not to inſiſt with too much reſolution and rigour thereupon, with promiſes of abatements on their Farm, ſuppoſing that time would compoſe the differences, and allay the indignation which the Ambaſſadours had conceived againſt him: but finding to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that their anger was kept alive with ſcorn, and diſreſpect to his Perſon and Office: and that though the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were engaged in Wars one againſt the other, and that their Ambaſſadours at <hi>Rome</hi> were on that ſcore at odds and unfriendly one with the other: yet they agreed, and entertained a good underſtanding together in what concerned the quadruple knot which they had ſealed againſt him. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri</hi> fearing the conſequences of theſe matters, reſolved to caſt himſelf into the hands of <hi>France,</hi> but the Duke <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> refuſed to accept of any terms, or Conditions with him; wherefore he applied himſelf to the other Ambaſſadours with deſign to break the Combination; but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring the ſame difficulties he applied himſelf to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> where the Counſels and conſiderations being of a different nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the quiet of <hi>Italy,</hi> rather than animoſity to the perſon of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieri,</hi> Orders were diſpatched to Cardinal <hi>Nitardi</hi> to cloſe with him, and to enter again into a good correſpondence with the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperour taking the ſame meaſures, gave Orders to the Cardinal <hi>Landgrave</hi> to acknowledg <hi>Altieri</hi> as formerly for the Pope's Nephew, and to retain a good correſpondence with him: the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of theſe two great Monarchs, ordered their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter alſo to accept terms of reconciliation; by which means <hi>Altieri</hi> ſtood fair again with all the Ambaſſadours excepting onely the Duke <hi>d' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreé,</hi> who had other ſcores to reckon with him.</p>
               <p>When the news came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had given Order to their Ambaſſadour to reconcile himſelf with <hi>Altieri:</hi> thoſe who in that City have little more to do, than to diſcourſe of the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and make their reflections on the Acts of Princes; were of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>Altieri</hi> had made ſome offers to aſſiſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining the City of <hi>Meſſina</hi> from the <hi>French</hi>; which the Duke <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> having diſcovered, adjoined that quarrel to other matters of diſcontent: but ſuch conjectures as theſe could have no foundation, nor gain belief amongſt thoſe, who underſtand the conſtitution of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Cardinal, who was more inclined to heap up for himſelf, than ſow for others. But the more probable Opinion was, that <hi>Spain</hi> was deſirous to ſtand fair with the Pope, becauſe <hi>France</hi> was at odds with him, giving thereby a teſtimony to the World of the unquietneſs of that
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:50681:414"/>
Nation, which is contentedy with nothing of moderation; and in fine, that their behaviour towards all is inſolent, and inſupportable.</p>
               <p>The year 1675.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1675.</note> which was the Jubily, or holy year, being enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was after the uſual manner filled with multitudes of Pilgrims and Strangers, who crowded to obtain the benefit of Pardons and Indulgences which are plentifully iſſued, and beſtowed at that time. That year ſix Cardinals were created, namely, <hi>Alexander Creſcentio</hi> a <hi>Roman, Mareſcotti</hi> of <hi>Bologna, Rocci</hi> a <hi>Roman, Albritii</hi> a <hi>Neapolitan, Spada</hi> a <hi>Roman,</hi> and <hi>Philip Howard</hi> of the Illuſtrious Family of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who was a <hi>Dominican,</hi> having been Great Almoner to the Queen of <hi>England</hi>; this advancement was much facilitated by her Majeſties recommendations The which promotions the <hi>French</hi> King would not own, becauſe the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Marſeglia</hi> whom the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had recommended, (as we have related at the beginning of this Pope's Reign) was rejected to pleaſe the humour of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And indeed herein his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſeemed to have juſt cauſe of diſcontent: for though in the year 1671. <hi>Ceſar d' Eſtreé</hi> Brother of the Duke of that name and called Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> was created Cardinal; yet that honour being conferredat the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in recompence of ſome ſervices rendered to that Crown; and united onely to the bare recommendations of <hi>France</hi>; it was not eſteemed as a favour done to that King, but to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> onely, of which Kingdom <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> was made Protectour. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>Altieri</hi> would not underſtand it for other, than a favour done to <hi>France,</hi> without which and the intereſt of the Duke <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> it had ſcarce been obtained: for that Duke amongſt other Commiſſions brought from <hi>Rome,</hi> had particular inſtructions to demand of the Pope the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro</hi> and <hi>Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciglione</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> according to the Treaty of <hi>Piſa</hi>; but that being a morſel not eaſily digeſted by the Pope, <hi>Monſieur d' Eſtreé</hi> made his way thereupon to gain the Cardinal's Cap for his Brother, by a relaxation of that demand.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the year 1676.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1676.</note> there aroſe a Controverſie between the Pope and the Vice-King of <hi>Naples</hi> concerning the ſeizure of certain <hi>Banditi</hi> within the juriſdiction of the Eccleſiaſtical State, by Officers from the Vice-King; upon which Diſpute the Son of the Duke of <hi>Sora</hi> was baniſhed from <hi>Rome,</hi> upon pain of death in caſe he ſhould return.</p>
               <p>This Pope Canonized <hi>Cajetan Tienne</hi> founder of the Order of <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Clarks, Francis Borgia</hi> General of the <hi>Jeſuits, Philip Beniti</hi> reſtorer of the Order of the <hi>Servillians, Lewis Bertran,</hi> and <hi>Roſe</hi> of St. <hi>Mary</hi> both of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Order.</p>
               <p>Under theſe Circumſtances <hi>Altieri</hi> remained with <hi>France,</hi> when Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 10th. died; ſome few hours before whoſe death <hi>Altieri</hi> preſſed him to fill up the four vacant places of Cardinals, and though the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Barbarino</hi> joyned with him in the ſame requeſt; yet the Pope would not hearken to them, nor grant their deſire. And when at laſt, <hi>Altieri</hi> became more importunate with him than before, deſigning to ſupply the four vacant places with Creatures of his own, who might be able to fortifie his Intereſt againſt the next <hi>Conclave:</hi> the good Pope turned to him, and with ſome Anger ſaid: <hi>You may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelf, that you have been Pope for ſix years, Suffer me now to follow my own inclinations, and be Pope for ſix hours onely.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:50681:415"/>It was now generally concluded, and believed, that <hi>Altieri</hi> was ſo fallen into diſreputation with the whole College of Cardinals, and with the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo hated by all the Prelates, that immediately after the Pope's death, he would be removed from all his Offices, and deprived of his Suffrage in the enſuing <hi>Conclave.</hi> But <hi>Altieri</hi> had ſo well feathered his Neſt during his Reign under his reputed Uncle, that his Riches procured him Friends, and reconciled the minds of thoſe who were moſt eſtranged from him; ſo that he conſerved his Office of Chamberlain with other honourable Charges; and obtained a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for his Nephew <hi>Don Gaſparo</hi> in his place of General, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards entered triumphant into the <hi>Conclave:</hi> onely his main task was in what manner to reconcile himſelf to the favour of the moſt Chriſtian King; in regard the Cardinals of that Party declared, that they would neither act nor treat with <hi>Altieri,</hi> until he had firſt given ſatisfaction to his Majeſty.</p>

Howſoever things were ſo promiſing and favourable, that <hi>Chigi</hi> who chiefly managed this Affair in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of <hi>Corſini,</hi> certainly believed, that he had gained his point, but Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Nitardo</hi> Ambaſſadour for <hi>Spain</hi> oppoſing the Election drew off all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> party, which being followed by the faction of the Grand Duke <hi>Corſini</hi> was wholly abandoned, and but one Vote left him at the Evening when Acceſſion was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chigi</hi> not diſcouraged with this ill ſucceſs was ſtill plotting to bring in the <hi>French</hi> party to his aſſiſtance; but was countermined by <hi>Altieri</hi> and the <hi>Flying Squadron.</hi> During which, another party was ſet up cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>New Squadron</hi> conſiſting of certain Cardinals, who pretended great Zeal, and to be ſolely moved from a ſincere and godly principle to promote a Perſon to the Chair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who was eminent for his Religion, and Wiſdom without any regard to worldly or ſecular intereſt. The Chief, or Head of theſe Profeſſours was Cardinal <hi>Gravina,</hi> who having from his firſt entrance into the <hi>Conclave</hi> fixed his Eyes on Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Odeſcalchi,</hi> could never by any oppoſition, or difficulty to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary be removed from his deſign of promoting (as he judged) the moſt worthy perſon of all the <hi>Conclave.</hi> On this occaſion <hi>Gravina</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing all his intereſt and art, Scrutiny was again made, and then thirty ſix Votes appeared in favour of <hi>Odeſcalchi</hi>; which number being great, and ſufficient to ſecure the Pope's Election; a rumour was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſpread, that the Pope was choſen, which drew ſuch a concourſe of people to the gates of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> that the Guards were doubled, to keep off the throng from crowding into the precincts of the <hi>Conclave.</hi> Notwithſtanding which, at the Acceſſion ſome of the aforeſaid number ſell off; for <hi>Altieri,</hi> and <hi>Chigi</hi> had laboured under hand, ſeducing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with vain hopes to promote ſome Creature of their reſpective Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on farther conſiderations ſpan out the time with delays, expecting firſt to receive directions from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> before they proceeded to a final reſolution.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Cardinals inclined chiefly to the election of <hi>Roſpiglioſi,</hi> but in caſe his intereſt ſhould fail, they approved of none ſo well as of <hi>Odeſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi>; for though he was a ſubject of <hi>Spain,</hi> yet his Vertues, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere intentions of his mind towards the welfare of the Church, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to all Parties, and Intereſts. The Cardinals which compoſed this <hi>New Squadron</hi> were ſixteen in number, the Chief of which was <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina,</hi> who ever remained immoveable, and would never nominate, or propoſe other than <hi>Odeſcalchi</hi>; the other Cardinals were <hi>Cibo, Barberigo, Litta, Buonviſi, Caraffa, Howard</hi> of <hi>Norfolk, Roſpiglioſi, Acciaioli, Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei, Albici, Nitardo, Roſetti, Pio, Vidone,</hi> and <hi>Odeſcalchi:</hi> the which Party with their Adherents was ſo ſtrong, as to balance at any time the Election, and to exclude any whom they were pleaſed to reject.</p>
               <p>Howſoever the party of <hi>Odeſcalchi</hi> was not ſo ſtrong, but that it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of another balance; for <hi>Barberino,</hi> and <hi>Chigi</hi> began a negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in favour of <hi>Fachenetti,</hi> which was in ſo probable a way to ſucceed that Srutiny being made in the Morning, twenty two Votes appeared for him, and at the Evening eleven onely upon the Acceſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:50681:416"/>Whereupon <hi>Gravina</hi> and the zealous Cardinals renewed the Scrutiny again for <hi>Odeſcalchi,</hi> by which twenty nine were given in his favour; which number with the former favourable Scrutinies did clearly manifeſt, that the <hi>Conclave</hi> was generally inclined to this Perſon: which occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a common rumour through all the Town that the Pope was made and that <hi>Odeſcalchi</hi> was choſen; which was ſo confidently reported, that the people began to aſſemble, with intention to rifle and plunder the Palace of that Cardinal, had it not been defended by a Guard of Soldiers. And indeed the <hi>Conclave</hi> had then really proceeded to have compleated their Choice, and by Acceſſion created him Pope, had not Cardinal <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> ſuſpended the proceedings, by a Requeſt he made; that their Eminencies would be pleaſed for ſome ſhort time to defer the ultimate point which determines their Election, until the arrival of ſome <hi>French</hi> Cardinals, who by order of the King were now on their journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Conclave:</hi> which he propoſed (as he ſaid) not to thwart, or alter the Choice they had made of ſo worthy a Perſon, in which he alſo concurred; but that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty might have opporunity thereby to join with them in ſuch a ſacred Election by the conſent and approbation which he was ready to yield thereunto.</p>
               <p>In the mean time not to remain idle, ſeveral Deſigns were put in practice in behalf of divers Cardinals: <hi>Conti</hi> was one that was ſet up, and his intereſt promoted by Cardinal <hi>Azzolino</hi>; but this perſon failing, the next in nomination was <hi>Piccolomini</hi> ſupported by <hi>Chigi</hi> and <hi>Azzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino,</hi> and founded on the intereſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Great Duke; who to allure <hi>Altieri</hi> to a concurrence with them, they engaged that <hi>Piccolomini</hi> being elected Pope, he ſhould advance <hi>Bichi</hi> (who was the intimate Friend of <hi>Altieri</hi>) to the degree, and dignity of Cardinal Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew: but this offer prevailed not upon <hi>Altieri,</hi> who had other deſigns and intentions in his proſpect. <hi>Chigi</hi> failing herein reſolved to try the fortune of Cardinal <hi>Spinola,</hi> who though a <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> was yet a perſon of great worth, and learning, and well practiſed in publick Affairs, having reſided for ſome time with the Emperour in <hi>Germany,</hi> in quality of Nuntio from the Pope; but this would not do neither, for being put to the Scrutiny, no more than ſeven Votes were preſented for him. Then Cardinal <hi>Creſcentio</hi> was propoſed, and offered to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to the Faction of <hi>Pamfilio:</hi> but this intereſt being manifeſtly oppoſite to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and to the Duke <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> Ambaſſadour for that King, and by conſequence to all the <hi>French</hi> party; there remained little hopes of ſucceſs for him, or his Promoters. Then new Scrutinies being again made: <hi>Odeſcalchi</hi> had fourteen Votes, <hi>Alberici</hi> nine, old <hi>Carpegna</hi> had ſeven, <hi>Albici</hi> five, <hi>Gaſtaldi</hi> nine, and <hi>Creſcentio</hi> three.</p>
               <p>Thus did the <hi>Conclave</hi> trifle away their time until the thirtieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the Cardinals <hi>Retz, Buglion, Bonſi,</hi> and <hi>Maldachino,</hi> arrived at <hi>Rome</hi>; ſo that it was expected, that very ſpeedily an Election would follow, and that according to common Opinion, the perſon would be no other than <hi>Odeſcalchi,</hi> though at the ſame time <hi>Albritio</hi> by the dexterous management of <hi>Altieri, Carpegna,</hi> and <hi>Colonna,</hi> was put into a fair courſe of promotion: but his hopes were ſoon daſhed by oppoſite par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the different intereſts became ſo embroiled, and intrigueſome, that in all probability the Election was not likely to ſucceed in ſeveral months.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:50681:416"/>On the firſt of <hi>September</hi> the Cardinals <hi>Retz, Buglion, Bonſi,</hi> and <hi>Muldachino</hi> entered the <hi>Conclave,</hi> accompanied with a numerous train, and a concourſe of people, crying out after them for a ſpeedy Election, and for a <hi>Roſpiglioſi,</hi> or an <hi>Odeſcalchi.</hi> Thus were the people as well without, as the Cardinals within inclined generally to the election of <hi>Odeſcalchi</hi>; with whom alſo the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals agreed, and by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Votes ſtrengthened his Party: but in regard his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty carried at that time a mighty ſtroak in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> as he did in all the Councils of <hi>Europe,</hi> it was judged convenient not to conclude on this important matter without the aſſent, and approbation of his Majeſty. To this end Corriers or Poſts were expreſly diſpatched with advices, and informations from the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals; and in the mean time, (as is very obſervable, and never before practiſed) the whole <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave</hi> fixed their Eyes on <hi>Odeſcalchi</hi> as the perſon deſigned, and marked out for this eminent employment; and from that very time paid him the ſame honour, duty and reverence, as if he had been already promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Papal Throne.</p>
               <p>And now the Cardinals had little more to do than to quarrel amongſt themſelves; <hi>Colonna</hi> and <hi>Maldachino</hi> had a Diſpute with very ſharp words, reviling each other, with Fool, and Beaſt; but the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable was that between Cardinal <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Buglion</hi>; for that the latter had not returned the Viſit, which the former had made to him; in excuſe for which <hi>Buglion</hi> freely declared, that it was his King's poſitive Command to him, not to acknowledg the Cardinals of the laſt promotion, either by Ceremony, or Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any Treaty, or Negotiation whatſoever. But the Cardinal of <hi>Norfolk</hi> would not allow of this Excuſe, inſiſting on the King's good will, and gracious favours towards his Perſon; when in his journey, and paſſage through <hi>France</hi> from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> he was pleaſed to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him with his own Coaches, and to give Orders to the Governours of all Cities, through which he was to paſs to treat him with a reſpect due to the Character of a Cardinal, and to the dignity of his Illuſtrious Family; the which favours his Majeſty would never have beſtowed in that gracious manner had his intentions been different, and not incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to allow him for a Cardinal, under which notion he was treated, and received in all parts of <hi>France.</hi> But this was not the private, or ſingle caſe of the Cardinal of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> for all that promotion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the quarrel, which the <hi>Conclave</hi> conſidering as dangerous, and ſuch, as might cauſe great diſorder and confuſion, they immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched a Letter to his Majeſty ſubſcribed alſo by the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals, beſeeching his Majeſty that he would be pleaſed to order his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour the Duke <hi>de Eſtreé,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals, and all his other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Miniſters at <hi>Rome,</hi> to own, and viſit the ſix Cardinals of the laſt promotion, created by the late Pope <hi>Clement</hi> X. which would avoid many inconveniences, and diſturbances in the <hi>Conclave</hi> to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and hindrance of that important Affair now incumbent upon them until anſwers were returned to the foregoing diſpatches. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave</hi> not to be idle, employed themſelves upon ſeveral Scrutinies, in favour of <hi>Maſſimi, Cerri, Fachinetti,</hi> and others, but none of them ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to that number of Votes, which on all occaſions appeared for <hi>Odeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calchi,</hi> all other trials became faint, and inſignificant. So that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:50681:417"/>
inclination of the <hi>Conclave</hi> ſeemed in deſpight of <hi>Altieri,</hi> and the endeavours of his Adherents to the contrary, to be entirely fixed, and ſetled on the perſon of <hi>Odeſcalchi</hi>; to whoſe promotion nothing was now wanting, but the concurrence and approbation of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, on the 19th of <hi>September</hi> the Corrier returned from <hi>France,</hi> of which ſecret intelligence was given to the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals in the <hi>Conclave,</hi> and that the anſwers were highly in favour of <hi>Odeſcalchi,</hi> as a Perſon grateful, and in every kind acceptable to his Majeſty. On the twentieth the Duke <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> was introduced into the <hi>Conclave,</hi> where he preſented the Letters from his moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Majeſty to the College of Cardinals in anſwer to thoſe lately ſent by them: and then in a moſt eloquent Speech he repreſented unto them the neceſſity there was to proceed to the ſpeedy election of a Pope, whoſe Government was now more than neceſſary to the Chriſtian World. That in the College of Cardinals there was ſo many perſons of Vertue, that they had an ample Field for their Election; yet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that the Vicar of Chriſt was to be of the number of thoſe, who did tranſcend in all the Vertues, and Graces of Religion, and ſuch as would reform the abuſes, and corruptions, which to the ſcandal of the Chriſtian Church, were crept into the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>: he would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto them one who was of a publick Spirit, ſincere, and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, deciphering unto them thereby, though without naming, the very perſon of <hi>Odeſcalchi:</hi> and having praiſed and applauded Cardinal <hi>Barberino,</hi> and giving God thanks for the great piety and zeal of that Man, he retired, leaving the <hi>Conclave</hi> to their free Election, in which now there appeared no farther difficulty, in regard the major part had received a plenary inſpiration from <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here on this occaſion it would be no impertinent Query, whether the Court at <hi>Paris</hi> was not as much concerned in the choice of a Pope, as the <hi>Conclave</hi> was at <hi>Rome.</hi> But this will not be ſtrange, or new; for <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Leo</hi> the 3d. gave a power to approve, or diſallow the election of the Pope unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; and <hi>Leo</hi> the 8th, confirmed the ſame priviledg to <hi>Otho:</hi> And when the Church hath been powerful it hath made Emperours; and when Emperours have been victorious, and proſperous, they have made Popes.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, that Evening a great number of Cardinals went to the Cell of <hi>Odeſcalchi,</hi> and kiſſed his hand, which was the irretractable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, and engagement of their Votes for him: but the good man ſhewed ſome unwillingneſs and reluctance thereunto, deſiring them with tears in his Eyes to chuſe ſome other Subject more able to ſupport the great load and burden of ſo mighty a weight. Howſoever being at length overcome by the Arguments, and perſuaſions of his Friends, he conſented thereunto, upon condition, that they would aſſent unto, and ſubſcribe certain Articles for reformation of the Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he then propoſed to them; which the Cardinals approving, a great part of them ſubſcribed that Night and ſwore to maintain them, as did the others in like manner the day following. And now <hi>Altieri</hi> finding that it was to no purpoſe to ſtruggle, and contend longer; and fearing leſt the Election ſhould be made without him, he became the moſt forward of any to make the Scrutiny, being followed by all his
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:50681:417"/>
Creatures, who were nineteen in number; ſo then the Choice was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately determined by the Acceſs; and on the 21th. of <hi>September</hi> 1676. the whole <hi>Conclave</hi> with one Voice and Mind declared <hi>Odeſcalchi</hi> to be the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Vicar of Chriſt, and the true and undoubted Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour of St. <hi>Peter:</hi> and then Cardinal <hi>Barberino</hi> who was Dean of the College, was the firſt by the duty of his place to lead the others to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration; and was afterwards followed by all one after the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Offices, and Seniority.</p>
               <p>The Adoration being performed, he was veſted in his Pontifical Habit, taking the name of <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. in remembrance of his Benefactor, who had aſſumed him into the Degree, and Order of Cardinals; after which he was conducted into the Chappel with the accuſtomed Ceremonies, and being placed by the Altar, he there received the ſecond Adoration, which being finiſhed the Maſter of Ceremonies demanded, whether it was the pleaſure of His Holineſs that the Nobility then attending with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, deſirous to kiſs his feet, ſhould be admitted in, to pay the duty, and devotion which they owed to the Succeſſour of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which being granted the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> was the firſt introduced to perform that Complement; after her followed the Ambaſſadours and Miniſters of the crowned Heads, after whom came the Princes, Prelates and Nobles, all which having kiſſed the feet of the Pope, teſtified the exceſs of joy they conceived for the promotion of a Perſon ſo worthy of all honour unto the Papal Chair.</p>
               <p>After which a Door was opened over the Great <hi>Portico</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, into which the Maſter of the Ceremonies led the way carrying a Croſs before the Pope and Cardinals, which the people with great reverence adored at a diſtance, and the Cardinal <hi>Maldachino,</hi> who was firſt Deacon, preſenting the Pope before them, pronounced with a loud Voice theſe following words after the accuſtomed manner, <hi>Annuncio Vobis gaudium magnum: habemus Pontificem Eminentiſſimum, &amp; Reverendiſſimum Dominum, Cardinalem Benedictum Odeſcalcum, qui ſibi Nomen impoſuit Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> XI. It is not to be expreſſed with what joy the common people, and the City entertained the news of this Pope's advancement; the Bells were rung, and all the Cannon of the City were fired, and the Soldiers diſcharged many Vollies of their Muſquets with ſounds of Drums and Trumpets; and ſeized on the Coach and Horſes, and the very Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Cloak, which they challenged to themſelves for their fees. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which Solemnity, and whileſt <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung, no alteration appeared in the countenance of the Pope, unleſs it were a more than uſual penſiveneſs and mortification, not diſcovering the leaſt vanity, or loftineſs in his looks which other Popes were never able to conceal; but bleſſed, and croſſed the People with a floud of tears which fell from his Eyes. Some perſons may weep for joy, but tears from what paſſion ſoever they proceed are always the Indications of a ſoft, and gentle temper, when men of a more hardy nature, evidence the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and elations of their Heart by a proud and a ſupercilious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Benedictus Odeſcalchi</hi> was born at <hi>Como</hi> a City in the Dukedom of <hi>Milan</hi> in the year of our Lord 1611. hi Father was called <hi>Livio,</hi> and his Mother <hi>Paula Caſtella,</hi> and both of Noble, and Patrician Families in <hi>Como,</hi> with a Revenue of thirty thouſand Crowns a year, belonging to
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:50681:418"/>
the Houſe of <hi>Odeſcalchi.</hi> In his youth he was educated by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and by them inſtructed in Grammar, and humane learning. He aftewards ſtudied the Civil and the Canon Laws, partly at <hi>Rome,</hi> and partly at <hi>Naples</hi>; and though he was never eſteemed for a Polemical Divine, yet he had the reputation of one who knew the World well, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the nature of Mankind, and the Art of Government. In the time of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. he was made one of the <hi>Prothonotaries</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Chamber, and afterwards was created Preſident of the ſame: he was alſo made Chief Commiſſary for gathering the Taxes, and Duties ariſing in the Province of <hi>Marchio</hi> which were laid on the people at the time of Wars in <hi>Italy.</hi> After this buſineſs was over, he was conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Governour of <hi>Macerata,</hi> and the Province thereunto adjoyning. By <hi>Innocent</hi> X. he was made one of the Clarks of his Chamber, and not long after in the year 1645. he was aſſumed into the College of Cardinals having the Deaconry beſtowed on him of the Saints <hi>Coſma,</hi> and <hi>Damianus:</hi> and being afterwards tranſlated into the Order of Prieſts, he had the Title conferred on him of St. <hi>Onuphrius,</hi> and by the ſame <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> ſent to <hi>Ferrara</hi> with the Title of Legat: in which Office having acquitted himſelf with great honour, he was made Biſhop of <hi>Novareſe,</hi> where he reſided for ſome years, but afterwards was removed from thence at his own deſire, by reaſon of the heavineſs of the Air in that place, which did not well agree with the conſtitution of his body. Being at <hi>Rome</hi> he was employed in many Affairs of the Church, and called to ſerve in diverſe Congregations of Cardinals: on which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he was made Protectour of ſeveral Colleges and Monaſteries; and in all he behaved himſelf with ſingular prudence, modeſty and vertue, until he was aſſumed into the Supreme degree of the Papal Throne: to which having (as we have ſaid) been elected on the 21th of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> he was Crowned with the uſual Ceremonies on the 4th of <hi>October</hi> following.</p>
               <p>After the Election and Coronation of the Pope were finiſhed, the <hi>French</hi> Cardinals prepared for their return to <hi>France</hi>; but before their departure they paid their Viſits to the Cardinals of the laſt promotion, who had not hitherto been acknowledged by the King, for the reaſons before mentioned. But thoſe quarrels being now vaniſhed by the change of Affairs in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Viſits were returned, and a good correſpondence again renewed, and eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as this Pope had taken the Government of Affairs into his own hands, he began a reformation in ſeveral particulars: and in the firſt place conſidering that <hi>Nepotiſm,</hi> or the advancement of Nephews both in Riches, and Power was odious to the People, and of great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Church; of which examples had been given by thoſe Popes, who having been over tender, and indulgent to their own Families, had ſuffered their Nephews to blemiſh the honour of the Church by Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal corruptions, and by their Avarice and Ambition to exhauſt the Treaſure of the Apoſtolical Chamber; this Pope therefore (as we ſay) conſidering theſe matters, reſolved to give the firſt Example hereof in his own Family; and accordingly refuſed to receive his Nephew <hi>Don Livio</hi> into any part of the Government, forbidding him to receive, or return Viſits under the Notion of Nephew to the Pope. But that this Nephew might not complain of the ſeverity of his Uncle, or judge his
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:50681:418"/>
Eſtate nothing improved by this fortune of his Family, he relinquiſhed unto him all his Temporal Eſtate amounting unto thirty thouſand Crowns of yearly Revenue.</p>
               <p>But in regard that Princes are not able to ſupport the whole burthen of their Government on their own ſhoulders: the Pope not having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his own Relations, but to ſuch as were fit, and adequate to theſe great undertakings; made choice of Cardinal <hi>Cibo</hi> for his Secretary of State, being a perſon endued with a great and generous Soul, and a clear underſtanding, zealous for the welfare of the Church, and dexterous in the management of politick Affairs. This beginning gave encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to good and wiſe Men who conceived hopes by an inſtance of this nature that Vertue and wiſdom would return again into uſe, and faſhion: and the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in general rejoyced to find themſelves freed from the pride, inſolence, and covetouſneſs of Nephews. Howſoever the Family of <hi>Altieri</hi> was continued in their Military Employments, and others confirmed in their reſpective Offices: but becauſe War was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal and not the Trade, or profeſſion of the Church which was now in peace with all the World, he retrenched the pay, or Penſion belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Officers of the Papal Army; cauſing them to remain ſatisfied with the Name, and Dignity, without the benefit, or profits of their reſpective Commands; which proved of great eaſe to the Apoſtolical Chamber. Howſoever knowing that Authority is not to be maintained without Power, and force; and reſolving to become Maſter of <hi>Rome,</hi> he encreaſed the number of his Archers; in the liſting of which, he took not every fellow that came to offer his ſervice, but ſuch onely as were ſober Men, not given to quarrels, or to commit ſuch inſolences as the <hi>Corſi,</hi> who were the cauſe of great diſturbance to <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever on the other ſide not to receive inſults from Ambaſſadours or other Repreſentatives of Kings, or Nobles and Princes of <hi>Rome</hi>: in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to Juſtice, and the rules of ſevere Government, he abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to them the priviledg to protect Miſcreants, and Criminals within the Precincts, or certain limits aſſigned by themſelves to be Sanctuaries for all Villains and Murtherers, that ſhould fly for refuge to thoſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and in purſuance of this reſolution, he ſeized a certain famous <hi>Bandito</hi> at <hi>Riccia,</hi> where the Prince, and Princeſs <hi>Chigi</hi> have a Seat, and poſſeſſion; the which was admitted without any oppoſition made thereunto.</p>
               <p>Farther, the Pope confirmed the ſeventeen Articles which were ſigned (as we have ſaid) in the <hi>Conclave</hi> by all the Cardinals; being ſuch as for the moſt part tended to a Reformation of manners, and to an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe abuſes which were crept into the Church. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to demonſtrate his great zeal for the welfare and reputation of the Papal See, he openly reproved the vanity of thoſe Cardinals, who pleaſed themſelves with fine Coaches, and rich Liveries, giving them to underſtand the incongruity there was between thoſe worldly Gayeties, and the profeſſion of thoſe, who had devoted themſelves to that ſober, and ſerious life which becomes the gravity of a good and a holy Prelat. And in regard that in times of preceding Popes, many unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by the force of Money, and Simonaical dealings were ariſen to Epiſcopal Dignities: the Pope appointed four Cardinals, and four other Clergymen, to examine the lives, and manners of ſuch, who aſpired to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:50681:419"/>
the degree of Biſhops; ordering them to admit none thereunto, ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or in the leaſt blemiſhed with an ill fame, or taxed of ignorance, as well as of a debauched converſation. And in order to a thorough reformation the Pope drove out all the Courteſans, and Strumpets from <hi>Rome,</hi> and perſons openly ſcandalous and diſſolute in their manners; and amongſt others he baniſhed a Gentleman of quality into <hi>Germany,</hi> for having made a violent attempt on the chaſtity of a Lady of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved modeſty: All Houſes of Play, or gaming for Money were put down, and all leud and unlawful Aſſemblies were fobridden. And in regard the Barons of <hi>Rome</hi> had by the priviledg of their Nobility, raiſed themſelves above the reach of their Creditors. The Pope ordered Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Cibo</hi> to make a narrow inſpection thereinto, and to pay the Debts of the Barons out of the Money of the Chamber; by which means theſe Debts being aſſigned over to the Chamber, a payment of the ſame might more eaſily be forced by vigour of that Law, which enforces the proceedings of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe Acts of Juſtice the Pope added one of great generoſity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who having by the late Wars loſt the greateſt part of her Revenue in <hi>Sweden</hi>; in recompence thereof he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto her a Penſion of twelve thouſand Crowns a year. And having laid theſe firſt foundations, and beginnings of good Government: the Pope's next work was to labour in the promotion of a Peace between the two Crowns, and all other Chriſtian Princes; that laying aſide all differences, and quarrels amongſt themſelves they might unite their forces for the good and welfare of Chriſtendom againſt the common Enemy the <hi>Turk:</hi> to this effect he wrote Letters to the Emperour, and to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> exhorting them to Peace and Concord, of which he offered himſelf to be the Mediator, and to be aſſiſtant thereunto in Perſon, provided that the place appointed for the Treaty, were aſſigned in ſome City of the Catholick Religion: On the other ſide he animated the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to continue his War againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> and not to lay down his Arms until he had recovered <hi>Kaminiec,</hi> and revenged himſelf of the Affront put upon him by the late <hi>Viſier Kuperlee,</hi> who had taken Contribution under the notion of Tribute from his City of <hi>Leopolis</hi>; and to enable and encourage him thereunto, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him the ſum of fifty thouſand Crowns.</p>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 1677.</note>But whilſt the Pope laboured for Peace abroad, he was not able to keep himſelf, nor his Court free from diſturbances at home: for the Marquis <hi>del Carpio</hi> who reſided at <hi>Rome</hi> in quality of Ambaſſadour for his Catholick Majeſty, being informed of the great want his Maſter had of Soldiers to ſend into <hi>Sicily,</hi> adventured to make ſome levies of men in <hi>Rome,</hi> pretending that the <hi>French</hi> on ſome occaſions had practiſed the like; but the People not being ignorant of the bad pay, and ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came very ſlowly to enroll their names: and moreover a report was rumoured abroad, that many people were want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who were hid in Cellars by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> till an opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to tranſport them into <hi>Sicily.</hi> This report, whether it were true, or falſe, yet ſerved the turn of ſuch who delighted in troubles and Seditions; for being entertained with ſome malice in the minds of the people, they conceived ſuch an abhorrence of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nation, that they affronted them in all places, which ſometimes proceeded to fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:50681:419"/>
and ſcuffles, in which ſeveral were killed and wounded; but the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> being few in number and the weaker ſide, were at laſt forced to keep within their quarters, for fear of the multitude. The Pope to ſuppreſs theſe tumults, and prevent diſorders, puniſhed ſeveral perſons, who were guilty of the Riots, with juſt ſeverity; but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour not contented herewith pretended ſome higher and more exemplary ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; at which the Pope grew angry, declaring that the Ambaſſadour was in arrear to him, and obliged rather to give than to demand ſatisfaction: upon which the Ambaſſadour to ſhew his reſentment, refuſed to appear at Court, and at the ſame time the Vice-King of <hi>Naples</hi> without any cauſe, or reaſon denied Audience to the Pope's Nuntio at that City. This manner of proceeding was highly diſpleaſing to <hi>Innocent,</hi> whoſe anger was the more encreaſed on the ſcore of other abuſes introduced into <hi>Rome</hi> by pretended priviledges of forein Miniſters; who aſſumed to themſelves a juriſdiction, (as we have ſaid) within certain limits, which they chalked out to themſelves, to make a Sanctuary, or place of refuge for Criminals, and out-lawed perſons. And conſidering by how much more the Franchiſes, and priviledges of publick Repreſentatives encreaſed in <hi>Rome,</hi> by ſo much was the Pope's Authority diminiſhed and abated, he therefore grievouſly took occaſion to complain in the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the ill uſe, which Ambaſſadours and other Miniſters made of their priviledges to the great ſcandal and reproach of the Government; that he had long expected that the Princes themſelves ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced ſuch irregular pretences, and out of love to juſtice have become inſtrumental to bring wicked men to puniſhment, rather than to be Protectours of Aſſaſſinates and out-lawed perſons; but ſeeing that his expectations, and patience was all in vain; he was now reſolved for diſcharge of his Duty and Conſcience to provide for the ſecurity of his own People. Howſoever he could not without ſome ſad reflections on the indiſcreet, and unreaſonable importunities of ſome forein Miniſters, find himſelf conſtrained to take ſuch meaſures in his Affairs, as would prove diſpleaſing to them; for that it was unreaſonable, whilſt his mind was employed in cares and contrivances for the propagation of the faith, for reformation of the Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Peace and Concord between Chriſtian Princes, and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters conducing to the good and benefit of the Commonweal of all Chriſtendom; he ſhould be diſturbed and interrupted in theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by the very Miniſters of thoſe Princes, for whoſe welfare, and for the peace of whoſe People, he was in continual care and labour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not being able longer to ſupport ſuch impertinences; he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to become Maſter in <hi>Rome,</hi> as other Princes were in their own Dominions; and in purſuance thereof he publiſhed an Edict, forbidding all perſons whatſoever to affix the Arms of any great perſonage over his Shop; it being a mark, that that Family had renounced the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Prince the Pope, and put themſelves under the protection of that Ambaſſadour, or Prince, or Nobleman, whoſe Arms they had affixed over the Portal of the Houſe, or entrance to the Shop. This reſolute Act much ſurprized the minds of thoſe whom it concerned, and eſpecially the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who made a falſe judgment of the temper of <hi>Odeſcalchi</hi>; conceiving him to be ſo wary and cautious in his actions, that he would never engulf himſelf in the ſame circumſtances of Affairs,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:50681:420"/>
which had given a diſturbance to his Predeceſſour, during the whole courſe of his Pontificate. Howſoever the Pope continuing firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in his reſolution, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> remitted ſomething of the ſtiffneſs of their pride; for conſidering that the circumſtances of their preſent Affairs would not admit of a diſunion with <hi>Rome,</hi> the Ambaſſadour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have Audience of the Pope; the which was refuſed to him, until the Nuntio had received Audience at <hi>Naples</hi>; and that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> by ſpecial Letters under his own hand, had deſired that his Ambaſſadour might be heard on ſome emergencies, and urgent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; upon which, and at the perſuaſions of the Cardinals <hi>Barberino,</hi> and <hi>Cibo,</hi> the Ambaſſadour was admitted to Audience; which having produced a true and right underſtanding between both Parties, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour departed with ample ſatisfaction acquieſcing in the late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Court.</p>
               <p>The Thorns which have ever been moſt prickly and pungent in the ſides of Popes, were their Conteſts with Kings, or crowned Heads, or when the Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical Authority contended with the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, as may appear by that notable Controverſie between <hi>Paul</hi> V. and the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and in other matters of ſmaller moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Kings, and Popes, both before and ſince that time. The point of the <hi>Regalia</hi> hath been an antient Diſpute for many Ages in <hi>France</hi>; the which was in ſome ſort determined in the year 1431. by the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> where it was ordained that Cathedral Churches and others ſhould have a freedom of Elections: This afterwards was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a great Aſſembly of <hi>French</hi> Clergy gathered at <hi>Bourges,</hi> and addreſſed to the King <hi>Charles</hi> the 7th. deſiring him to undertake the protection of that Council: At that time, the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> ſent to the King an abſtract of their Decrees conſiſting of thirty ſeven Articles, by which Decennial Councils, and the Authority of Councils above the Pope was eſtabliſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with an abſtract of the Decree they had made concerning Elections. All which were conſidered at that Aſſembly, where the Dauphin and the chief Nobility of <hi>France</hi> were preſent, and by their advice the famous Pragmatick Sanction was made in confirmation of thoſe Articles; which was obſerved during the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the 7th. but <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh eſteeming it the Intereſt of <hi>France</hi> to maintain a good correſpondence with the Papacy, was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to wave the advantage of this Sanction.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1478.</note>In the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the 8th. an Aſſembly of States being called at <hi>Tours,</hi> the third Eſtate petitioned, that the Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Sanction might be again renewed, and confirmed; calling thoſe who were preferred by the Court to be Court-Biſhops; ſo it was again put into force and practice, much to the diſpleaſure of the Pope; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which, <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12th. made a perpetual Edict in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it. <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt ſucceeding to the Crown, and having vaſt deſigns in <hi>Italy,</hi> thought it not his intereſt to ſtand at a diſtance with the Pope;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1515.</note> and therefore was willing to treat with him about the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pragmatick Sanction on ſuch terms, as might reconcile his own prerogative with the Pope's Authority. This deſign occaſioned an Interview between the King and the Pope at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and thence the Concordat was produced, which was afterwards put into the form of a Bull, and confirmed by the Council at <hi>Lateran.</hi> The ſum of which
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:50681:420"/>
was this: <hi>the King and the Pope agreed to divide the Promotions to all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies between them; for the King was to nominate the Perſon within ſix months after a vacancy, and the Pope was to confirm him if no lawful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception did lie againſt him.</hi> All which is ſo fully and learnedly treated by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Regale or Rights of Princes in diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, and Church Lands, and deduced down to this preſent time; that there is no place left for our enlargement thereupon, unleſs we add ſome few, and ſhort remarks on the behaviour of this <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. towards his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty on this occaſion. It is manifeſt by Hiſtory, that when the Emperours flouriſhed with great Power, and Riches, they created Popes, or at leaſt they had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of them: and when Emperours were low, and were oppreſſed by adverſe Fortune, the Popes forced them to be beholding to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive reach of the Eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction, which by ſome ſide-wind, or far-fetched notion of Spiritual Concernment, reduced almoſt every thing under cogniſance of the Church.</p>
               <p>According to this natural courſe of worldly affairs: <hi>Lewis</hi> the 14th. the moſt Chriſtian King being high,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burnet.</hi>
                  </note> and proſperous in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, reſolved to put a period to the proceſs for the Regale which had continued near thirty years, and at laſt in the year 1673. came to a concluſion, and Declaration was made:
<q>That the King had Right of Regale in all his Dominions without diſtinction, except onely in thoſe Sees, that had purchaſed their exemption from it: And therefore all Biſhops who had not yet regiſtred their Oaths of Fidelity in the Chambers of Accounts, were required to do it, and to take out a Writ upon it for cloſing the Regale, otherwiſe rheir Biſhopricks were ſtill to be looked on, as under it.</q>
All the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> unwilling to incurr the diſpleaſure of their ſucceſsful Monarch, ſubmitted; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Biſhops of <hi>Alet,</hi> and <hi>Pamiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was now under the Reign of <hi>Clement</hi> X. an old doating Pope, who having his parts and underſtanding enfeebled by old Age, he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the management of the Pontificate to the ſole direction of Cardinal <hi>Paluzzi,</hi> afterwards adopted by the Pope, and called <hi>Altieri</hi>; a Perſon, who from his firſt beginning was diſtaſtful to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and not until this time well reconciled unto it, as we have at large declared in the foregoing Life. This was the time, I ſay, when open Claim to the Regale was renewed in favour of the King, and when the Pope himſelf was ſcarce able to diſtinguiſh his Intereſt; and <hi>Altieri</hi> was ſo thwarted and oppoſed by the Court of <hi>France,</hi> that he had enough to do to conſerve his own perſonal Intereſt, much leſs to vindicate, and contend for the Rights of the Church in a caſe ſo litigious as this.</p>
               <p>In <hi>January</hi> 1676. the King's Right was claimed in diſpoſal of the Deanry of <hi>Alet</hi>; the Diſpute of which was left unto the Biſhop to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, for the Pope being under the foregoing Circumſtances, took little cogniſance thereof either by himſelf or his Cardinal. But this good Pope dying in the month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> next following, the Controverſie fell to the lot of <hi>Innocent</hi> the 11th. to maintain, and to diſpute in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the eldeſt Son of the Church. This quarrel was increaſed by a Conteſt at <hi>Pamiers</hi>; where one <hi>Paucet</hi> was provided in Right of the Regale to be Arch-deacon of <hi>Pamiers,</hi> but was rejected by the Biſhop and Chapter: howſoever the Regale prevailed, for the Arch-Biſhop of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:50681:421"/>
                  <hi>Tholouſe</hi> was on their ſide, and gave judgment in favour of the Regaliſt. But on the contrary, the Biſhop of <hi>Pamiers</hi> acquieſced not with this Sentence, but made his appeal to the Pope, who was now engaged in the Controverſie, and the matter lodged in his hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Wherefore the Pope in the year 1678, wrote his Brief to the <hi>French</hi> King, and in ſoft and yet preſſing terms complained of the Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made on the Liberties of the Church, and the Authority of the Council of <hi>Lions:</hi> and after ſeveral Arguments to perſuade him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from this Enterpriſe; he concludes, that he cannot forget thoſe Popes his Predeceſſours, who upon the like occaſions had endured long, and great afflictions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe Allegations ſatisfied not the King, who pretended that the Rights of the Regale were inherent in the Crown, and had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by his Anceſtors, and by them derived down to himſelf. The Pope on the other ſide affirmed, that the Secular Powers had no right to things ſacred, but as it was derived to them by the Authority of the Church; and that the Church had not granted any ſuch Right, having expreſly limited it by the Council of <hi>Lions,</hi> which hath now been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved four hundred years.</p>
               <p>This Controverſie ſeemed to lie dormant from <hi>September</hi> 1678. to <hi>December</hi> 1679. until it was again revived, and ſtirred in the See of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miers,</hi> in that point which concerned the vacant Benefices and the mean Profits; for the King's Officers ſeized on them likewiſe, ſo that the good old Biſhop had nothing to live on the laſt twenty months of his life, but the Oblations and Charities of his People. On this occaſion the Pope wrote to the Cardinal <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> to interpoſe in this Affair, as being a Perſon more than ordinarily concerned in the dignity of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical See. To which the Cardinal made anſwer in the ſtyle of a Court-Biſhop, extolling the King's merit, his zeal for the Faith, and reſpect for the Apoſtolical Chair; what he had done for the ſuppreſſion of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> and Hereſie within his Dominions, and how bravely he had defended the Chriſtian Cauſe againſt the <hi>Turks:</hi> and in fine, he laid down the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which would follow, if any diſſention ſhould ariſe between the King and the Church.</p>
               <p>At length Cardinal <hi>d' Eſtreé</hi> was diſpatched to <hi>Rome</hi> with a Letter of Credence, and Orders to treat immediately with the Pope himſelf; but it ſeems, his Negotiations produced little alteration; for the Pope continued ſteddy and conſtant to his Principles. And on the other ſide, the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> became as zealous for the King's Right and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; for which the King's Attorney General pleading, made little eſteem of the Pope's Cenſures which were paſſed for Obedience to the King's Orders.
<q>The Church, ſaid he, may indeed have an Authority to puniſh Men for Hereſie, and an ill life: but the World was now too well enlightned, not to diſcern that the Thunders of <hi>Rome</hi> had been for ſeveral Ages vainly employed for extending its Authority beyond all due bounds; the limits of which were to be found in the Canons of the Church, by which the Pope, as well as others ought to govern himſelf.</q>
And therefore deſired that the laſt Brief ſent by the Pope might be ſuppreſſed, which was accordingly done by a Judgment of the Court of Parliament on the laſt of <hi>March,</hi> 1681.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:50681:421"/>And to give a farther Authority to this Judgment, an Extraordinary Aſſembly was called of all the Biſhops, then reſiding at <hi>Paris</hi>; where were preſent ſix Arch-Biſhops, twenty ſix Biſhops, and ſix that were named to Biſhopricks, to whom the Agents of the Clergy repreſented the Invaſions made on the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church by the Pope's Briefs, both in general concerning the Regale, and in particular in the Affair at <hi>Pamiers,</hi> and the Nunneries, and concerning a Book of <hi>Gerbais</hi> a Dr. of <hi>Sorbonne, De cauſis Majoribus,</hi> which were equally contrary both to Church and State, to the Canons, and the <hi>Concordate,</hi> by which the Pope upon a ſimple Complaint without any Appeal, did by the plenitude of his Power, judg at <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the validity of Elections, and the Authority of Arch-Biſhops, and Primats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The iſſue of which Aſſembly was this: They aſſerted the Authority of National Churches for judging of all matters both of Faith and Manners: and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion agreed to make an Addreſs to the King, praying him to give leave either for a National Council, or an Aſſembly General: the latter of which was conſented unto by his Majeſty, and ſummoned to meet the firſt of <hi>October</hi> following. Thus far concerning the Regale we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted in ſhort by way of Epitome from the Treatiſe of Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> on that Subject. Now as to what follow'd. The Aſſembly met at the time appinted; at the opening of which, the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> preached a moſt Eloquent Sermon, with much applauſe: After which the point of the Regale was put to the queſtion, and argued learnedly on both ſides; and in concluſion the greateſt part were of Opinion, that the Right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Regalia were inherent in the Crown, and that the pretenſions thereunto were Uſurpations by the Church, as appears by this following Declaration.</p>

               <p>The other ten Hats remaining were kept in the hand of the Pope for a reſerve wherewith to gratifie Kings and Princes, whenſoever they ſhould deſire to have ſome of their own Creatures preferred to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. All the ſixteen preceding Cardinals took their promotion very patiently, and without much reluctancy; excepting <hi>Tayo</hi> who was eighty years of age, and <hi>Ricci</hi>: both which made ſome modeſt refuſals, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of that great honour, but the Pope inſtantly conſtraining them, they with humility ſubmitted. And here it is obſervable, that this Pope is not very forward to create Cardinals, but rather inclinable to leſſen, and reduce their number, which of late years hath increaſed to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to become a burthen to the Church.</p>
               <p>But to return unto the Aſſembly at <hi>Paris,</hi> which after many Debates and deliberate Conſultations held upon the point of the Regale: At length by the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> they offered theſe ſeveral Propoſals by way of accommodation between his Majeſty and the Pope.</p>
               <p>That thoſe on whom the King in Right of his Regality beſtows any Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, ſhall in the vacancy of the Sees have their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and Miſſion from the Vicars General.</p>
               <p>That the Chapters which are in poſſeſſion of beſtowing Prebends, and other Dignities, ſhall continue to diſpoſe of them, whilſt the See is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:50681:423"/>That in the Churches where the collation is alternative between the Biſhops, and the Chapters, the ſame ſhall be obſerved during the vacancy of the Sees that are under the Regality, the King having the turn which the Biſhop ſhould have had.</p>
               <p>That where the Biſhops diſpoſe of the Prebends jointly with the Chapter; the King ſhall in the vacancy of the See appoint a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner, who ſhall have the ſame power, and place in the Chapter, as the Biſhop had.</p>
               <p>Howſoever, no farther proceedings were made in this matter becauſe the Pope appeared reſolute to maintain his priviledg and juriſdiction: and the Cardinal <hi>d' Eſtrée</hi> who had ever ſince the beginning of this year been at <hi>Rome</hi> to try, and bend the mind of the Pope, gave little hopes to prevail with him: wherefore it was thought fit that the Controverſie ſhould remain in ſuſpence, rather than be farther preſſed to the breach of that amity, which interceded between the common Father, and the eldeſt Son of his Church: ſo the King holds his Right, and the Pope hath not relinquiſhed his Claim, but remains ſtill in a capacity to reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the ſame, when either he, or his Succeſſours are ſtrengthened with circumſtances of time, and force to make good their Demands.</p>
               <p>It is known to all the World, that in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> vain and ſuperſtitious Opinions have been ever growing for divers Centuries of years; ſome of the moſt wild and extravagant of which, certain Popes have been weeding out; but with that negligence and inattention, that where one hath been deſtroyed, twenty have ariſen. Hereof the preſent Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the XI. being ſenſible, (who is certainly one of the moſt underſtanding, and moſt worthy of thoſe that ever ſate in the Papal Chair) hath ſuppreſſed an Office called <hi>The Office of the Immaculate conception of the moſt Holy Virgin,</hi> approved by <hi>Paul</hi> V. who granted, <hi>unto whoſoever ſhould devoutly recite the ſame an hundred days Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> as may appear by his Bull of <hi>July</hi> 10th. 1615. printed at <hi>Milan.</hi> This Office he entirely aboliſhed, Decreeing,
<q>That no perſon of what Order, Degree, or Condition ſoever, ſhould dare to keep, read, print, or cauſe to be printed the ſaid Book: and requiring that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould have the ſaid Office in his keeping, ſhould forthwith deliver the ſame to the Ordinary, or to the Inquiſitors of the place.</q>
The which Decree was publiſhed, <hi>Feb.</hi> 19. 1678.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this Pope in his Wiſdom hath ſuppreſſed a multitude of idle, and fooliſh Indulgences, which many cheating Prieſts carried into remote Countries, and raiſed Money thereupon from the ignorant people. Of which kind were thoſe Indulgences granted by <hi>John</hi> II. and <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. to thoſe, who ſhould recite the Prayer of Charity of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Eugenius</hi> the 3d. to the Revelation made to St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> of a blow or ſtroak on the ſhoulder of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>By <hi>John</hi> the 22th. to thoſe, who kiſs the meaſure of the Soal of the foot of the Bleſſed Virgin.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th. to thoſe, who wear the Cord of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted firſt at <hi>Rome,</hi> and then at <hi>Milan, Anno</hi> 1665.</p>
               <p>To them that ſhall ſay the Angelical Prayer, when the Clock ſtrikes, to the Image of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> printed in a Circle with the Moon under her feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50681:423"/>By <hi>Paul</hi> V. and <hi>Gregory</hi> XV. to thoſe who ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be the Holy Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Likewiſe thoſe Indulgences for fourſcore thouſand years, copied out of the Antient Table, which is ſaid to be kept in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church, to thoſe, who ſay this truly pious Prayer, <hi>O God, who for the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Beſides which, this Pope ſuppreſſed a multitude of other Indulgences as vain and idle as the foregoing: and declared,
<q>that though accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> the uſe of Indulgences may be uſeful to the people, and doth Anathematize ſuch as ſhall deny, that there is not a power in the Church to grant them, yet he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous that the Doctrine thereof be rightly underſtood, and a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration uſed in the granting of them, leſt by a too great facility or eaſineſs, the diſcipline of the Church be corrupted and enfeebled.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine of Indulgences hath been a prickly and a contentious point, and the Original cauſe of the preſent diviſions, and ſeparations amongſt Chriſtians; for from thence <hi>Luther</hi> began his quarrel, and took the firſt riſe and ground for a Reformation; and indeed the matter on the part of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo ſcandalous, and abuſive, that the very common people in all their ignorance were able to diſcover the fraud and Cheat that was in them: ſo that the wiſe and Learned Men at the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> knowing that this Doctrine was not ſolid and would not hold water, they ſlightly touched thereupon; and though it was the chief matter, for which that Council was aſſembled; yet nothing was farther determined therein, <hi>than onely that Indulgences be uſed with ſuch moderation, as was approved by the Antient Cuſtom of the Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is a moſt certain, and an undeniable truth, that Indulgences were never in uſe with any Nation of the Eaſtern Churches either in the Primitive times, or afterwards. And indeed neither were they in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the Weſtern Churches, from times of Ancient date, that is, from before the time of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> II, which was about the year of Chriſt, 1095. and then alſo they were not very common, and granted onely to remit the rigour, and ſeverity of Penance enjoined by the Confeſſour: which reaſons this Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. wiſely conſidering, and the many abuſes of this Doctrine, did attempt the means to regulate the extravagance thereof.</p>
               <p>Beſides the ſuppreſſion of theſe Indulgences, this Pope condemned ſixty five Propoſitions about Caſes of Morality, which were ſcandalous, and divers of them maintained by the ſubtle diſtinctions of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> the preamble to which condemnation ſaith, that this preſent <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. in purſuance of the ſame work commenced by his Predeceſſour <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> VII. did by and with the advice, concurrence and aſſiſtance of the moſt Reverend, and Eminent, the Cardinals, as alſo of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors General, and many other Divines, gather, and weed out from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Books, Theſes, and other Papers lately written, a great number of ſcandalous, and pernicious Doctrines in Morality, tending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery of Manners, and to the encouragement of a looſe, and a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute life in Mankind.</p>
               <p>But in nothing more hath the Vertue, Piety, and care of this Pope been conſpicuous, than in thoſe large Aſſiſtances, and Contributions he
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:50681:424"/>
made to the Emperour, whereby to enable him to carry forward his War againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> who is the formidable Enemy of all Chriſtendom. Nor did he onely furniſh him with great ſums of Money at divers times, but invited and inſtantly exhorted the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to undertake that Heroick Act, whereby the City of <hi>Vienna</hi> was delivered, and all <hi>Auſtria</hi> reſcued from deſolation, and from being a prey to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Arms: And farther, his Negotiations prevailed to engage the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the ſame War, and to complicate a triple League between theſe Princes.</p>
               <p>Thus have we ſeen, that during the Reign of this Pope, nothing hath been acted by him, but what was deſigned to the common Good of his Church and State: for having laid aſide all the private conſiderations of his Nephews, and Family, his cares have been diverted towards the Common Good, ſo that being freed from the importunities of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Patron, and the unſatiable Avarice of Favourites, and other depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies; his Government is much leſs ſubject to <hi>Paſquils,</hi> or libellous Cenſures; but on the contrary applauded, and honoured by all wiſe, and good Men: ſo that continuing in this ſteddy courſe through the whole remainder of his Reign, he may be eſteemed, and numbered in the rank and degree of the good Popes.</p>
