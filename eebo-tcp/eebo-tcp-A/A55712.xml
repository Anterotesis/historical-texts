         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE TRANSLATOR TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Muſt acquaint the Reader that the following Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, having met with ſo <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal an Approbation beyond Sea, and ſo few of the French Copies being come over into <hi>England,</hi> I thought it would not be amiſs, if I endeavoured at leiſure hours to Tranſlate, and ſo to communicate that Book to the World, which gave me ſo much Diverſion and Entertainment in the Reading.</p>
            <p>The Deſign of theſe Dialogues is principally to offer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to our Heroick <hi>William</hi> the Third, who has with ſo happy an Augury begun to deliver <hi>Europe</hi> out of her Chains, and to check the Pride of that Ambitious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, whoſe Vanity and Injuſtice has thrown him upon no leſs a Deſign than of ſubjugating all the Weſtern World. In every Dialogue almoſt he takes occaſion to expoſe the Intrigues of the <hi>French,</hi> the Illegality of their Acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their Rapines and Violences, which were ſcarcely pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed amongſt the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> but I am ſure were never carried to that height and refinedneſs as we ſee them
<pb facs="tcp:29599:3"/>
in Modern <hi>France.</hi> He adviſes the Allies all along to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect no Opportunities, to fall into no different Parties or Factions, to eſpouſe the Common Quarrel of the Empire cordially and vigorouſly, to procure the ſame Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and not by entertaining any contemptible thoughts of their Enemy, or by thinking him weaker than really he is, to ſlacken their Endeavours, and leſſen their Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations againſt him.</p>
            <p>I only foreſee one Objection to the Book, and that is, becauſe the Author, whenever his Argument carries him into the Territories of Satyr, his Efforts that way are too feeble and ineffectual. In <hi>England</hi> 'tis only good, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough paced, ſubſtantial Scandal that pleaſes us; we don't love to do things by halves; and if we muſt write Satyr, 'tis expected we make our Thruſts home, and puſh freely. On the contrary, the French rally always with a great deal of Decorum, they are too intent upon the Punity of their Language, to have any great regard to the juſtneſs of their thoughts, and they forbear to ſpeak ſevere bitter things, leſt it ſpoil the evenneſs of their Style, as ſome Women in the World refuſe to oblige their Gallants for no other reaſon, than for fear it ſhould ruſſle or tumble their Clothes. And now whether what we have been ſpeaking of is an effect of French Civility, or French Weakneſs, I leave it to the determination of the Reader.</p>

               <p>To be free with you, moſt Holy Father, I am not come hither at this time to negotiate. Had that been my deſign, I ſhould not have made ſuch a long Journey; beſid<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> that the high Rank which I claim in the World, would have obliged me to demand of you the meeting of me half way. You are not ignorant, that when <hi>Leo</hi> the X. and <hi>Francis</hi> the I. deſired an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, how the Pope met him at <hi>Bologna.</hi> I believe you to be as good as <hi>Leo</hi> the X. but I believe my ſelf withal to be full as good a Man as <hi>Francis</hi> the I.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Alexand.</speaker>
               <p>You ſpeak in a ſtrange Dialect to me. What is then your deſign? Have you committed any Mortal Sin, and ſo are come in Pilgrimage to viſit the Churches of <hi>Rome,</hi> in order to obtain Abſolution?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing leſs than that. Bigottry is the leaſt Fault I have, though ſome will have me guilty of it. I ſee you can't divine my Intentions; and therefore give me leave briefly to unfold them to your Holineſs. The part which Princes are to act upon the Stage of this World, has always very much perplexed me: For that ſame thing which ye call Policy, engages them never to ſhew themſelves what they are; their Words are never the faithful Interpreters of their Thoughts. They talk and act all their Life time in Cipher, as I may ſo ſay; and he is counted the moſt politick and cunning, that can beſt unlock the Cipher of other Princes, and who has a Cipher of his own, which others can never find out the way to unfold. I muſt acknowledge that I have oft been mightily pleas'd with my ſelf with an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, that I could get <hi>incognito</hi> into the Court of any Prince, though as great as my ſelf; that it would not be impoſſible for me to oblige him to tell me the very bottom of his heart, as I have a deſign to do the ſame for him; and in regard this pleaſure is ſo great
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29599:4"/>
in it ſelf, and has withal the Charm of being a No<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>velty, I am apt to think that I ſhall taſte a Felicity, more perfect, than any I have hitherto enjoyed. I have made choice of your Court, as believing that, next to my ſelf, there is not a greater Prince than you in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi> and for that Diſſimulation is much deeper, and more at <hi>Rome</hi> than <hi>Verſailles,</hi> it muſt be in my Opinion an extraordinary pleaſure, to hear a Pope diſcover his Mind ſincerely, unfold his Sentiments clearly, and call every thing ingenuouſly by its own name.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Alexand.</speaker>
               <p>Your Deſign is very ſurprizing; and I can ſcarce imagine that you your ſelf ſhould conceive ſuch a thing. How! for a Pope to utter his mind plainly, and which is more, for a <hi>Venetian</hi> Pope too! What a Prodigy would that be! Aſſure your ſelf, my dear Son, that this is the greateſt Deſign that ever you ſet on foot; and to make a Judgment of it by the Rules of good Policy, it will be an eaſier Task for you to ſubdue all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and to ſet the Imperial Crown upon the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Head, then to oblige a Pope to tell ye his mind freely and ſincerely, and by that means to deſpoil himſelf of the Character of the <hi>Pontificate,</hi> to put on that of Humanity.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
               <p>The Deſign is great, I muſt acknowledge; but I have been told a hundred times, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impoſſible to me; and I have ſome Inclination to believe it. Beſides, you well know, that ſince the death of the Cardinals <hi>Richlieu</hi> and <hi>Mazarine,</hi> my Court has been no leſs impenetrable than yours. And therefore ſince that in deſpite of all Politicks, I am reſolved to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen my mind freely to you, why cannot you reſolve to deal with me after the ſame manner? I am apt to think by your laſt words, that you are half won already. What ſay ye, Holy Father, am I deceived in my Conjecture or no?</p>

               <speaker>Alexand.</speaker>
               <p>You may aſſure your ſelf, I am altogether gained. For as you have ordered your buſineſs, how can any man refuſe you? But upon Condition, if you pleaſe, that you ſhall not ſay a word to the Cardinals. For I make no doubt, but that if they ſhould know that I were able to lay aſide but for a moment that profound Diſſimulation, which is the <hi>Proprium quarto modo,</hi> the Property in the fourth degree of a Soveraign Pontiff, they would degrade me, and put another in my room. For my part, I will not ſay a word about this intreague to your Prime Miniſter, for fear you ſhould have ſome ſmall <hi>Reprimand:</hi> for how ſubmiſſive ſoever he may carry himſelf to you, I pretty well know, that you have given him leave to rebuke you ſometimes, when you act againſt your own real Intereſts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
               <p>I accept your Conditions. And to begin, let us lay aſide, I beſeech you, the Titles of <hi>Holy Father,</hi> and <hi>Eldeſt Son of the Church,</hi> which were invented on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to amuſe the Vulgar, and to impoſe upon Fools. My Name is <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and yours <hi>Peter Ottoboni.</hi> This is ſufficient for us at preſent, there needs no more Ceremony between us. Now then, ſince you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to talk to me of the Bulls which I demanded of you ſome years ſince, you muſt give me leave to tell you, that I have bought dear enough in all Conſcience a few ſheets of Parchment, only with a woollen Twiſt, and about half a pound of Lead to them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Alexand.</speaker>

               <p>Do you reckon nothing for the Inſtallations which thoſe Bulls give to your Biſhops, without which all their Functions would be look'd upon as ſo many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledges?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
               <p>This looks very fair at firſt ſight; but at the bottom it ſignifies nothing. You know that thoſe Bulls are not always neceſſary. Formerly they were little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and 'twere not a ſtraw matter whether they were minded now, or no.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Alexand.</speaker>
               <p>This nothing ſcares me. I muſt confeſs they are not very neceſſary; but the Biſhops are not of the ſame Opinion, and that is ſufficient for me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lewis.</speaker>
               <p>The Biſhops of my Kingdom are no more too accompted Gulls than you or I. This was good in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, when their Ignorance was ſo very groſs, that there were ſome Prelates that could not write their Names: now Knowledge is not ſo ſcarce. And I'le hold you a wager, there is not a Biſhop in my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who does not very well underſtand, that if Bulls are deſired of you, 'tis only out of formality. And therefore believe me for your own good, never be ſo ſhie in granting them, exchange your <hi>Parchment</hi> for my <hi>Louydores</hi> while the time is, for fear leaſt at length they grow weary of your Refuſals. You have done enough to ſave the Honour of the <hi>Holy See,</hi> and it may prove dangerous to puſh on your Severity too far.</p>

               <p>If the Biſhops fail, I have one ſtring more to my Bowe, the People are for me; and the People are the greater number. The Biſhops may tell them, that they value not the Bulls that come from <hi>Rome,</hi> but they'l never believe a Tittle they ſay: nor will they ever look upon them as lawful Paſtors, that are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of ſuch a Letter of Credence.</p>

               <p>Is it becauſe the People underſtand any thing? Certainly you do not mean as you ſay. It is apparent that you have not been very familiar with that many headed Beaſt, and that you have only formed an Idea of Mankind by what you have obſerved in your Miniſters and Favourites. Believe me, <hi>Lewis,</hi> if the People ſhould once begin to reaſon, neither you nor I ſhould be what we are. They would underſtand their Rights and Priviledges, and aſſume them into their own hands, and we ſhould be reduced within a narrow Compaſs; but by good luck for us both, the Definition of <hi>Animal Rationale</hi> was never made for the People.

The Conſequence that would be drawn from thence againſt me, is this, that I ſhould have no Authority over them; and that what I aſſume to my ſelf is altogether uſurped; and then that which they would ſay againſt you, would be this, That all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which you arrogate to your ſelf is Arbitrary and Illegal.

               <p>Very good. And did you ever hear of an Ambitious Prince that was unfurniſhed of Pretences? Come, you ſhall ſee me here on the ſudden offer you a Hundred, rather than fail. In the firſt place, you may if you pleaſe, renew the Rights of the old <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, whom you have ſucceeded, and to whom, as every Body knows, the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> formerly belonged. Or if you have no mind to go ſo far, you may then order your Nuncio to pick ſome quarrel or other with the Viceroy, upon the Score of Eccleſiaſtical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munites, and ſo revive thoſe Differences afreſh that were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29599:9"/>
ſo unluckily laid aſleep. But if you don't think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to urge that expedient, why then while the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is alive, take into your hands the Rights which the Holy See pretends to have to that Kingdom after his deceaſe. You know that all the Popes have aſſerted that the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> ought to return to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Demain, whenever the Heirs-Male of <hi>Spain</hi> chance to fail. You likewiſe know that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not at all ignorant of theſe Pretenſions; and as they are ſenſible of the Juſtice of them, it may be they will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all their Efforts to Sacrifice all ſuch Perſons in that Kingdom, whom they ſuſpect to be devoted to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Intereſt.</p>

But I don't demand of you how I ſhall be able to juſtifie my ſelf as to this particular, I mean, for uſurping thoſe Rights during the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Life, which are allowed to be of no efficacy till after his death. For methinks you intend to ſay, that the indiſpoſition of that Prince, has out of a Principle of juſt precaution, obliged me to ſeize thoſe Rights before-hand, for fear leaſt you ſhould pretend to them your ſelf, in the Name of the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> the preſumptive Heir of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> in caſe that King ſhould die on the ſudden; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that I am to reſtore this Kingdom back again to its true Owner, if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould, contrary to the Expectation of the whole World, chance to leave an Heir behind him.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29599:9"/>
eaſily out of their hands? Don't you know, 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid of us Eccleſiaſticks, That we are like the Lyon's Den in the Fable, every thing enters there, but nothing comes out? Beſides, is it not a moſt infallible truth, that if ever the States of <hi>Spain</hi> come to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the <hi>Dauphin</hi> your Son, that you'l have as juſt a Title to <hi>Naples</hi> as to <hi>Madrid?</hi> And therefore how will it advantage me, I beſeech you, to take it out of the hands of the Catholick King, if I muſt afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to you.</p>

And now I would have you conſider, that if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ever comes to be miſſing, you know my meaning, I cannot be every where. 'Tis very probable, that while I am reducing of <hi>Spain,</hi> you will have done your buſineſs in <hi>Naples.</hi> And thus, either ſooner or later, no matter whether, I ſhall certainly come to be re-poſſeſſed of all my Rights. Nevertheleſs, take my word for't, there may happen an infinite number of Accidents in the Interim, that may wholly change the Face of Affairs: 'Tis ever good to hold what one can, and to ſpeak my mind freely, if I were in your caſe, I would immediately ſeize <hi>Naples,</hi> and afterwards diſpute that Game with me.</p>

               <p>I am of your Opinion: But there's one thing, I confeſs, which does ſomewhat perplex me. 'Tis not neceſſary to inform you, ſince all the World al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready knows it, that I love my Nephews ten times more than I do the Church: and not to conceal any thing from you, If I ſhould ever chance to make a Conqueſt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29599:10"/>
it ſhould not be with a deſign to enlarge St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. That honeſt Apoſtle has no occaſion for ſuch kind of Services; but 'tis not ſo with my Nephews, and therefore they ſhould be the only Perſons who ſhould reap the benefit of what we have been talking about. Now I am mightily afraid that this ſame buſineſs would but ſound ill in the Ears of the World, and that the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> would not be well pleas'd to ſee the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> poſſeſſed by a Race of Upſtarts: for, not to mince the matter with you, my Predeceſſors were never deſcended from <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s Thigh, and the Family of the <hi>Ottoboni</hi> was not well known in the World, before I brought it out of its primitive Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Beſides, I fear that after my Death, the ſame Fate would attend my Nephews, which formerly happened to the famous <hi>Caeſar Borgia.</hi> I have read ſomewhere in <hi>Machiavel,</hi> (for I turn over that Author oftner than my <hi>Breviary</hi>) that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth having ſettled a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Principality upon his Natural Son <hi>Caeſar Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> who was ſtiled Duke of <hi>Valentia,</hi> no ſooner was that Pope dead, but he was immediately turned out of all that he had by <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, who thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to revenge himſelf of thoſe Injuries which he formerly received from him, when he was Cardinal under the Title of <hi>Sancti Petro ad Vincula.</hi>

               <p>'Tis not at all difficult to anſwer every thing you have offered, if you will but give your Attention for a while. I don't in the leaſt blame you for the tenderneſs which you expreſs for your Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, for I would willingly know why any man is made a Pope, if it were not to raiſe the Fortune of his Relations and Friends? In my Opinion, few Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would think it worth the while for a man to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all his life, in order to arrive to the Pontificate at
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29599:10"/>
laſt in a feeble decrepit Age, to ſacrifice his Repoſe and Pleaſures to gain him the Reputation of Sanctity, to paſs his Days and Nights in the management of long tedious Intreagues, and to conſume the vigour of his Youth in the mortifying Fatigues of refined Policy, if he were to ſuffer all this purely for the good of Holy Church, and muſt leave his Family behind him in their old obſcurity and miſery. Such a Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as this never entred into the heart of an <hi>Italian</hi>; the Church is already rich enough, and what ſerves a Pope for, but to make his beſt Market of her Spoils. As for what relates to the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, let them not give you any occaſion of fear: Do but give a Comedy to one, a Miſtreſs and a ſet of B— to another; ſuffer the third to fill his Coffers peaceably, and take my word for it, you'l have no reaſon to torment your ſelf upon that ſcore. 'Tis true, your Family is none of the moſt Illuſtrious, but what of that? Is it the only Family in the World that raiſed it ſelf from a mean Condition to a higher Dignity? Pray tell me what were the <hi>Sforza</hi>'s at firſt, who were Dukes of <hi>Millain,</hi> or the <hi>Medici,</hi> who have poſſeſſed themſelves of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of <hi>Florence.</hi> And then, as for what concerns the Example of <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> who loſt immediately after his Father's Death, all that he had acquired du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Life; let me tell you, 'tis no good Conſequence. There happens an ill-favour'd Accident to day, which perhaps may never arrive any more. <hi>Caeſar Borgio</hi> was ſick to the laſt Extremity, when <hi>Alexander</hi> the Sixth died: He was not prepared for that ſudden Blow; and when he found himſelf better, 'twas then too late, the Opportunity was ſlipt. But very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that if he had not been ſo unluckily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed at that time, he had not only preſerved
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29599:11"/>
what he had gotten in his Father's Life, but had alſo extended the bounds of that Eſtate which he gained by his Prudence and incomparable Dexterity.</p>

               <p>All this is not without a great appearance of truth. I will conſider of it. In the mean time I muſt leave you by your ſelf to diſpatch a little buſineſs. If you have any Advantage over the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> you need not queſtion put I'le make good uſe of the favourable moment, and endeavour to chaſe him out of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> provided at the ſame time, that I find you are in a Condition to turn him out of the Dutchy of <hi>Millain.</hi>

               <p>WEll, I told you before, that in my Judgment you had done much better to have complied with the King of <hi>France</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, then to come to trouble all <hi>Italy</hi> by your <hi>Opinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treté,</hi> and to conſume us here with unprofitable Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which 'tis impoſſible for us to ſuſtain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke of Savoy.</speaker>
               <p>How! Could you ever imagine it to be my Intereſt to put <hi>Turin</hi> and <hi>Verceil</hi> into the hands of the <hi>French</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Tuſcany.</speaker>
               <p>Look you there! What a mighty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage it would have been for you to have had your two beſt places guarded by the Troops of <hi>France</hi>? You would rather have profited by it exceedingly, ſince thoſe Garriſons were to be paid at the Charges of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, and muſt of Courſe have ſpent their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in your Country.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Savoy.</speaker>
               <p>This is the true Language of a Prince who is only paſſionate to have his Coffers full, but is not the Inclination of one who has a greater regard to his Glory than to his Intereſt. Perhaps you are of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion too, that I muſt lend my Troops to act againſt the <hi>Millaneſe.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Tuſcany.</speaker>
               <p>Very well! As if that had been the Deſign of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty. Don't you ſee
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29599:12"/>
that that Prince had no Reſolution to make War in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi> He knew very well that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> armed with no other deſign, but only to ſupport you, and that as ſoon as ever they had ſeen you reconciled to him, they would have changed their Battery; and as for himſelf, he would have turned his Arms elſewhere.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Savoy.</speaker>
               <p>I am willing to believe what you have ſaid, though 'tis to be feared he would have made his Advantage of that Occaſion, and finding himſelf ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> would have attempted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Millaneſe.</hi> But to come cloſer to you? Do you think it fit, that a Prince who is a Soveraign born, ſhould quit the moſt important Places of his Dominion, and receive a Stranger into his Capital City, to whoſe Laws he muſt be obliged to ſubmit himſelf, and to whoſe Rapines he muſt abandon his whole Country?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Tuſcany.</speaker>
               <p>The truth is, that Condition is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what mortifying; but you ſhould have conſidered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that you had ſecured the Peace of <hi>Italy</hi> by that piece of Conduct. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to go to Balls, and Comedies, according to his laudable Cuſtom. The Princes of—and of—would have continued to ſolace themſelves in the Pleaſures of Love. The Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> had purſued their Conqueſts without Interruption; and as for my own particular, I had not been obliged to bleed my ſelf, as I may ſo ſay, to maintain the War which is ready to pour its Fury upon us. For, in fine, if <hi>France</hi> is powerful e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to chaſe you out of your Eſtate, 'tis not to be ſuppoſed, that ſhe will ſuffer the <hi>Millaneſe</hi> to enjoy their Repoſe long, to whom ſhe has a quarrel for declaring themſelves in your favour. Who knows but the Fire will ſpread further yet? and if that happen, ſhall we not be mightily beholding to you for forcing us to take
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29599:12"/>
up Arms to defend our reſpective Eſtates, and to drive out the Enemy from thence, who if he continue to make his Advances as he has begun, will ſooner or later en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave us all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Savoy.</speaker>
               <p>By your reckoning, I perceive I ought to have been the Aſs in the Fable, who was to be ſacrificed for the good of the Common Cauſe. But though I don't altogether agree with you upon this Point, yet I am very willing to be ſacrificed for the Publick Benefit, ſince I lye the neareſt to the Enemy; yet I deſire withal, that this Sacrifice may be done in ſuch a manner, that it may tend to ſome Advantage. Now this is never likely to happen, untill you will cordially aſſiſt, and put me in a Capacity to ſupport the Tempeſt of the War, which is juſt falling down upon me. If I had deliver'd up my ſtrong Places and Troops, as you know who demanded of me, pray inform me what Advantage had you drawn from thence? Had you not been exactly in the very ſame pain as you are at preſent; and though you ſay, that it was not his moſt Chriſtian Majeſties Deſign to puſh this Point any further, who told you that he was poſſeſt with no ſuch Ambition? eſpecially ſince he knew very well, that as for your own part, you had rather reſign your ſelf, and all your Grandeur, to your dearly beloved Eaſe, than help to ſupport the Burthen of War, let it be never ſo juſt and neceſſary. It was therefore much better done, in my Opinion, that I have pulled off his Maſque, and that I have once in my Life put my ſelf in a Condition to be delivered from this Servitude, and not be everlaſtingly tormented between Slavery and Liberty. If 'tis my good Fortune to be uppermoſt, I ſhall have the Honour of chaſing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy out of <hi>Italy</hi>; and if I fall in the Attempt, you muſt expect to meet with the ſame Fate, and that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29599:13"/>
you will not be in a much worſe Condition, than if I had mannaged my ſelf, as <hi>France</hi> would have had me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Tuſcany.</speaker>
               <p>Be it ſo then, ſince you'l have it ſo: and puſh on your Point, for I will not oppoſe you any more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Savoy.</speaker>
               <p>That is not enough; You muſt aſſiſt me, ſince you ſee I have not a ſufficient Power to reſiſt the Puiſſance of <hi>France:</hi> And I have reaſon to apprehend the greateſt part of their Forces will fall upon me, ſince 'tis from the ſide of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> and <hi>Provence</hi> that they fear the moſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Tuſcany.</speaker>
               <p>I acknowledge that the other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould aſſiſt you, and I promiſe you that I will ſollicite them my ſelf on your behalf; though, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the truth, I don't ſee any great probability of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. The <hi>Venetians</hi> are altogether taken up in their War againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi> The Pope has enough to do to ſatisfie the rapacious devouring humour of his Nephews, who at this preſent moment are at Daggers drawing one with another, none of them being content with the Portion that has been made them. The Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> has neither the will to ſuccour you, ſince in his heart he is firmly devoted to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt; nor the Power, ſince all he can do is but juſt ſufficient to ſuſtain that Rank which he holds in the World. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> is ſo far from aſſiſting his Neighbours, that he's upon the point to ſell his Capital City, all that Money which he had for the Surrender of <hi>Caſal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent a long while ago. The Republick of <hi>Genoa</hi> wiſhes no better to you, than to <hi>France</hi>; ſhe could be content with all her heart that you would both ruine one another; but ſhe will never be perſwaded to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply you with any thing. In ſhort, I muſt needs tell you, that there is never a Potentate in <hi>Italy,</hi> that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29599:13"/>
has either the Power, or the Inclination to aſſiſt you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Savoy.</speaker>
               <p>I could make a ſhift to play my Game well enough without the Aid of any of thoſe Princes you have mentioned to me, provided you would but heartily aſſiſt me. I don't demand any Troops of you, for I know you are not able to furniſh me with a great number; nor indeed have I any great Concern for that matter. <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Switzerland</hi> abound with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who deſire nothing more than to enter into my Service: but the miſery on't is, I want Money, and there's never a Perſon in the World that is in a better Condition to relieve me that way than your ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Tuſcany.</speaker>
               <p>What! that I have Money! Lord, who was it told you that I had any,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Savoy.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis the publick Report, that makes you paſs for the richeſt Prince, in ready Caſh, that is in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Tuſcany.</speaker>
               <p>I profeſs 'tis all a meer Calumny; and I wonder in my heart where you had it firſt. God knows I have enough to defray the Expences of my own Court, although they are but very inconſiderable; and then the Cardinal <hi>de Medecis</hi> there has beggar'd me to all intents and purpoſes, to appear at <hi>Rome</hi> in a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure conformable to his Condition.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Savoy.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, you have a great deal of reaſon, that I muſt needs own. 'Tis true, the Expences of your Court are but very ordinary; but ſtill that is an effect rather of your great Frugality, then of the want of your Ability. And as for the Damage which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>de Medecis</hi> did you, when he was elevated to the Purple, alas that is not as yet advanced to a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; and what is that, I pray, to thoſe prodigious Sums of Money which you have horded up in your Coffers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:29599:14"/>
               <speaker>D. of Tuſcany.</speaker>
               <p>Once more I tell you, they are all meer Calumnies. Why certainly I ought to know my own Strength better then any one elſe. I don't know where I can take up one ſingle Farthing to aſſiſt you; and if you reckon'd upon that, when you firſt declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France,</hi> I muſt deſire you to unreckon it again, ſince you reckon'd without your Hoſt. For to deal plainly with you, your Troops muſt dine ſomewhat of the lateſt, if they are to dine with the Money which I ſhall give them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Savoy.</speaker>
               <p>Is it for certain then, that I am to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no manner of Relief from the part of <hi>Italy</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Tuſcany.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing can be more certain; and if you'd follow my Advice, you'd endeavour to get your ſelf reconciled to <hi>France,</hi> though it were at the Expence of loſing one part of your Principality.</p>

               <p>Very good Counſel this, I profeſs: and which I am certain you would never have followed your ſelf, had you been in my place, and for my own part I never deſign to be directed by it. Well then, if the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> fail me, I will make my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to thoſe of <hi>Germany,</hi> who will be ſure to take the Exigence of my Affairs into their Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Holland</hi> already ſtretches forth both her Arms towards me. The King of <hi>England,</hi> who is always ready to declare himſelf in favour of the Oppreſſed, eſpouſes my part: and our Poſterity ſhall know that the Proteſtants generouſly came from the remoteſt Quarters of <hi>Europe</hi> to ſettle the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> nay, to defend the Pope, and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, from the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the <hi>French,</hi> at the ſame time when the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians</hi> gave themſelves over to a diſhonourable Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy and Eaſe. Their Succours, it may be, will come ſomewhat late, but then they are ſure and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29599:14"/>
certain; ſince the Proteſtants, who are of a different Principle from our <hi>Italians,</hi> held themſelves obliged to keep their word; and when they give, 'tis their peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Glory to give more than they promis'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>D. of Tuſcany,</speaker>
               <p>Well, do you look after that. We ought to lay hold of that which makes for our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, let it come from what Quarter it will: And if the <hi>Hugonots</hi> have offer'd you their Aſſiſtance, I adviſe you to accept of it.</p>

               <p>And were not the other Favours which I ſcatter'd at that time, enough to convince any Subjects in the World, that my Intentions were real, and that I was become a new man? You remember without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, how I vacated and ruined in the ſpace of one

               <p>Why, this is your peculiar Talent. You always do either too little, or too much. All thoſe ſolemn Revocations of your former proceedings ſerved only to acquaint the World that you were a Prince, who had a great deal of Fear in your Conſtitution, but very little Steadineſs and Bravery. Your People, who were aware of your blind ſide, reſolved that ſince you began to fear, they would make you afraid to ſome purpoſe, and this, as I take it, was the firſt ſtep you made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Precipice. For notwithſtanding all you did, it was not ſufficient to make the World believe that you had altogether thrown aſide your Deſign; though it muſt be confeſſed, that for a time you had changed your Conduct. It was no hard matter to perceive that you only gave way to the Neceſſities of the preſent Juncture, and that as ſoon as ever the Tempeſt was blown over your Head, you would re-aſſume your firſt Reſolutions. But now the hanging up of a dozen Jeſuites, and Father <hi>Petre</hi> in the firſt place, would have paſſed for a plain palpable demonſtration of your thorough Amendment, even to the moſt diſaffected. Nay, I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that not a man in your three Kingdoms, and I think we may comprehend the Catholicks in the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, but would have thought you had turned your Coat, and effectually reconciled your ſelf to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Party.</p>

               <p>And why not? Since in doing of this, you only followed the Example of a Son of one of his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29599:16"/>
Predeceſſors. You ſee I am now ſpeaking of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Borgio,</hi> who having made uſe of <hi>Remiro d'Orco,</hi> a cruel and active Man, to exerciſe a thouſand Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Romaigne,</hi> which he had lately conquered, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to eſtabliſh his Authority the better; and fearing that ſo inhumane a Conduct would render him odious to the People, reſolved with himſelf to make a Sacrifice of this <hi>Remiro,</hi> and ſo having diſpatched the Villain, he expoſed the pieces of his mangled Body in the Market-place of <hi>Ceſene,</hi> with a bloody Knife by his ſide, to ſhow the People that the Cruelties which had been committed, did not proceed from him, but his Miniſter. Would you know what was the Conſequence of this Affair? The People were ſurprized at it, and all their Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents cured in a moment. A pretty Example this for <hi>James</hi> the Second to follow, if he had but conſulted <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel.</hi>

They are a ſort of men that are too zealouſly devoted to their own proper Intereſts, not to ſee, that as the Tide ran then, it was for their Advantage to Sacrifice ten or a dozen of their Members for the good of the whole Society. I dare engage for them, they would have vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily furniſhed you with a greater number for the Peace-offering, if your Occaſions had required it, but with this <hi>Salvo,</hi> to have made Saints of them after their Death, and ſo to have increaſed the Company

               <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales!</hi> that is a good Jeſt I'faith. I wonder in my heart how you came to trump that Card upon me. The Death of theſe Jeſuites has been as good as ſo many Letters of Legitimation for him, and there had not been a ſingle man in all your Kingdom, who would not have believed that you were his true Father, ſince you had made thoſe worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen dye, to whom we are obliged for his Birth. But if after all, your Subjects had continued ſtill to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur upon that Occaſion, why then if you would have been ruled by me, you ſhould have dropt the Royal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and utterly diſowned him: For a Perſon of your Experience need not be told, that you could never fail of having ſuch a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> as that was at any time.</p>

               <p>To confeſs the truth, I make a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of it, and I think not without reaſon on my ſide. All the Myſteries of his Birth are evident Proofs of his being an Impoſture; and I wonder in my heart how ſuch mighty Politicians as you had about you, could be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29599:17"/>
guilty of ſuch unpardonable Soleciſms in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Affair.</p>

                  <hi>James</hi> II.</speaker>
               <p>The little precaution that was uſed in the caſe, is in my Opinion an undeniable Argument for the truth of his Birth: for if a man had deſigned to palm an Infant upon the World, 'tis to be ſuppoſed he would have been better precaution'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>La Feuillade.</speaker>
               <p>That Argument would not be amiſs, if you had not known before hand that moſt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doubted of your Queens being with Child. But ſince you are well enough acquainted with the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Subjects, if there had been no juggle in the caſe, you ought to have uſed all imaginable care to have cured them of their Jealouſie, eſpecially in a Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this great Importance. This Conduct was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth upon a like Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and all Princes who have any regard to their Intereſts ought to follow it. The Empreſs <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, who was Surnamed the <hi>Severe,</hi> became big with Child when ſhe was about fifty years old. The Emperour, to remove that Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion which might probably have been entertained, and withal to ſatisfie the World that he deſigned to put no Impoſture upon them, ordered her lying in to be in the open Field, under the Tents, near <hi>Palerme,</hi> and this in the preſence of all the People. The Empreſs in the midſt of ſo Jovial an Aſſembly, on the Twenty ſixth of <hi>Decemb.</hi> in the Year 1196. was delivered of a Prince, whoſe Name was <hi>Frederick,</hi> who was afterwards elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Emperour. You were not ignorant of this remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Story. You could not but be ſenſible of the Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your own People, and therefore you ought to have obſerved the very ſame Conduct, if you had not ſuffered your ſelf to be ingaged in a Cheat. But <hi>latebat anguit in herbâ.</hi>

But my Deſign was to chalk out a way to Glory, which was altogether new and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing. Although the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was my own Son, yet I would not condeſcend to remove thoſe Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions which my Subjects had entertained about him, becauſe, relying upon my own power, I pleaſed my ſelf with the imagination, that all the World believed I had Credit and Authority enough over my Subjects, to give them a Succeſſor, ſuch as I pleaſed, and they not dare to disbelieve or mutter againſt it. Perhaps I had not taken up theſe Meaſures, if they had not been poſſeſſed with this unmannerly Suſpicion. And now you have the true cauſe of all the Myſtery (as you call it) which appear'd at that Birth.</p>

Few Perſons, I am ſure, would hazard the wearing of a Crown after this manner; and we have all the reaſon in the World to entertain but a very ordinary Opinion of your Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if you made no better uſe of it. 'Tis certain, that this reaſon was invented after the buſineſs was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and for my own part, I ſhould be loth to dive any further into this Secret, ſince I find you are not willing to make a Confident of me. As I am a Subject of the moſt Chriſtian King, and your moſt humble Servant, and ſo forth, I am willing to believe that the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> is your Son: But as I am a rational Creature, I hope you'l allow me the liberty to think as I pleaſe; for to deal freely with you, I cannot poſſibly bring my ſelf over to believe a Syllable of this matter, without paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

Nevertheleſs, I think I have reaſon to complain a little of the choice which was made of the Count <hi>de Lauzun,</hi> to Command the Troops which were ſent over to me. 'Tis to him, poſſibly, that I may owe the Miſcarriage of the War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> through the Miſtakes which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him.

               <p>HA! Am I not deceived? Is it you that I behold, and is the King of <hi>France</hi> ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to loſe in ſo ſhort a time two of his moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Enemies?</p>

               <speaker>Schomberg.</speaker>
               <p>You are not miſtaken, I am the very ſame. To acquaint you then with ſomewhat of my Hiſtory, you muſt underſtand that I commanded the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Army, till ſuch time as he came to head them himſelf. I was at the joyning of the two Armies, I was engaged in the fight, I aſſiſted to ſet every thing in the moſt advantageous poſture, when out of a fear to raviſh any part of the Glory out of that Monarch's hands, to whom it is intirely due, I quitted my Poſt to come to the Shades below, and particularly to inform you, for your comfort, that King <hi>William</hi> III. is ſtill alive, who alone is in a Capacity to reduce the common Enemy, that has hitherto diſturbed the Peace of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and whoſe reſtleſs Ambition has thrown him on no leſs a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign then making all the World wear his Fetters.</p>

               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>I agree with you in all the Elogies which you beſtow upon ſo great a Prince. 'Tis the greateſt ſatisfaction imaginable for me to underſtand that he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29599:24"/>
is ſtill alive; but for all that I cannot forbear the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying my Reſentment upon the occaſion of your Death. Without pretending to diminiſh the leaſt part of his Glory, I dare preſume to ſay, that you were no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable help to him: and I am very well perſwaded, that he is not altogether inſenſible of your loſs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Schomberg.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis indeed very true, that ſeveral of the Dead, who arrived here after me, have aſſured me, that he was pleaſed to honour me with a few Tears; but I am willing to attribute them rather to the kindneſs he had for me, than to the loſs he has ſuſtained by my Death.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive you are but newly arrived to theſe Quarters, becauſe you ſtill retain ſome of the Cuſtoms of the other World. I ought therefore to inform you, that here below we are altogether inſenſible to the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which are given us, and that as we never receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Elogies but what are real and due, ſo they that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, don't make it a matter of Ceremony to put them off, or diſown them. This method you are to uſe with me, and all the illuſtrious Dead with whom you are to converſe hereafter.</p>

               <p>I am willing to ſubmit to this Law, ſince it was not deſigned for me alone, but, as you tell me, obliges all of us equally. Purſuant to this Order you ought to aſſure me, that although our Deaths is very advantageous to the King of <hi>France,</hi> ſince it has deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him from two Enemies that were not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, yet it ought to be confeſs'd that the Advantage is equal.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>I don't altogether aſſent to what you have ſaid. You had without compariſon more Experience than my ſelf, and whatſoever Advance I made in the management of the late War, yet I muſt own that I had
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29599:24"/>
the glory to go to your School, and there to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with abundance of things that were unknown to me before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis true, I had ſomewhat more Experience then you; but you were in the flower of your Age, your years did not hinder you from the purſuit of Action and you were ſtill learning more and more every day. On the other hand, it was high time for me to conſider of a Retreat, and the weakneſſes of my Age would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to execute all thoſe Deſigns which I had formed before.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>I don't know which of us two hated <hi>France</hi> the moſt. As for my ſelf, I muſt own, that as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved I had all the juſt Occaſions in the World to hate her, ſo I never failed to ſhow it, as Opportunity ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schomberg.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis no wonder that your Averſion to her was ſo great, ſince you ſuck'd it in with your Milk. If you'l pardon the Expreſſion, and received it by way of Inheritance from your Anceſtors. Beſides, ſhe barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly deſpoiled you of your Paternal Inheritance, and that was too groſs and inſupportable an Injury to be ever forgotten. But now to come to my own Caſe, none of my Family had the leaſt Reaſon to complain of the moſt Chriſtian King, and till the laſt Perſecution, I had all manner of Obligations to thank <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth. If I ſerved him faithfully and honeſtly, he took care to recompence all my Services. My Religion at laſt compelled him to enjoyn my Retirement, and I preſently obeyed him. Notwithſtanding all this I have entertained no particular hatred for the Perſon of the King, for which I ſhall ever preſerve a great eſteem and reſpect. As I was left at liberty to diſpoſe of my ſelf ſo I believed it was lawful for me to engage in another
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:29599:25"/>
Service. The King put me out of a Capacity of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him any longer, but though this Conduct appear'd ſomewhat rude and ſevere, yet it never prevailed upon me ſo far, as to extinguiſh the memory of all my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Obligations. I was very glad that the late Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture did not carry me to make War directly againſt him, and if I had been obliged to have done it, by the duty of my Charge, I had done it, I confeſs, but not without ſome little regret, and ſome particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>Behold a generous temper of mind, and which is to be parallel'd but by very few Examples in the World. However, give me leave to uſe the freedom with you, as to tell you, that there was a particular Circumſtance in your Caſe, which may abundantly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie your Averſion. The King of <hi>France</hi> never obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me in all his life, and never received any manner of Service from me, ſo I never expected any kind uſage at his hands: But as for your ſelf, you have all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World to imagine, that ſince you had done ſo much for him, he would never repay you with ſo black an Ingratitude. You have declared that you were not influenced by any Paſſion of hatred; on the other hand, I freely own that it mingled it ſelf in all my Actions, and therefore upon that Conſideration I will agree with you, that the King of <hi>France</hi> had a more formidable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy in me than in your ſelf. And yet at the ſame time, I can never prevail with my ſelf to own that my Death was more advantageous to him than yours. Since his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> ſet himſelf at the head of his own Troops, he knew not where to find a General in whom they repoſed ſo much confidence, as in your ſelf. The Army could not believe you were capable of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any falſe Meaſures; they aſſured themſelves you
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:29599:25"/>
forſaw all the Contingencies of War, and therefore they ſlept with as much Security in their Camp, as if they had been in the beſt fortified place of <hi>Europe.</hi> They were ſenſible that you never went upon uncertainties, that you never hazarded the main Chance, or left things at random to the deciſion of Fortune, and this made them march under your Orders to the Battle as to an aſſured Victory. You muſt needs own, after all, that the <hi>French,</hi> who have a conſiderable number in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Army, and many of whom ſerved under you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in <hi>France</hi>; you muſt needs own, I ſay, that the <hi>French</hi> regarded you as a Common Father, that they were ſo well accuſtomed to your Orders, that they underſtood you at half a word, and that they had a certain kind of Emulation amongſt them, which ſhould execute your Commands with the greateſt readineſs and vigour. I am afraid that though King <hi>William</hi> the Third has placed himſelf at the head of them, they will never have a General who was more agreeable to them, and whom they obeyed with greater pleaſure and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. In fine, though they uſe to ſay that the Dead never afflict themſelves with the Affairs of the other World, yet I cannot forbear to be ſenſibly concerned at ſeeing you here, conſidering what a loſs the Allies have ſuſtain'd in you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schomberg.</speaker>
               <p>I am willing to confeſs that I was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unuſeful to the Allies, but then there is a vaſt difference in this Caſe between you and me. Experience has ſufficiently demonſtrated to the World, that the loſs is not equal. I am informed by ſeveral of the Dead who are lately arrived here, that my Death did not hinder the King from gaining the Battle, that he rendred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of <hi>Dublin</hi> afterwards, and of the better part of <hi>Ireland</hi>; ſo true it is that ſuch a Perſon as my
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:29599:26"/>
ſelf might be ſpared well enough. But now to come to you, one cannot compare the laſt years Compaign with this, without ſeeing ſenſibly how neceſſary your preſence was to the Allies. You took <hi>Mentz,</hi> where there were poſted near Ten thouſand of the Enemy, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards marched to the City of <hi>Bonne,</hi> which could not avoid Surrendring herſelf to you. But ſince your death, the <hi>Germans</hi> have done nothing at all, and I am told that the laſt Campagn has paſt without taking the leaſt ſpot of Ground. And do you think now that Matters had gone at this rate, if you had not been dead?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>Can, what you ſay, be poſſibly true? You are ill informed without queſtion, and it muſt certainly be ſome Frenchified Ghoſt or other, who has acquainted you with this piece of News.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schomberg.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, what I have told you is true to a ſyllable. That was viſibly the ſtate of the <hi>German</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs when I left the World; and the few dead <hi>Germans</hi> we ſee arrive here, are a ſufficient Argument to prove the truth of it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>To ſay the truth, I was ſomewhat ſurprized to ſee them drop ſo one after another. What, thought I with my ſelf, if they had given Battle upon the Banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> or if they had been employed in the Siege of any place, it were impoſſible but we ſhould behold whole droves of them tumbling down every day. And yet all this while, we could ſee but a vew ſad ſorry Souls, the Lord knows, come down to us, poor Vermine that dyed of Diſeaſes in their Beds, to inform us of what paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Campagn, and what other remarkable Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences happen'd in the World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schomberg.</speaker>
               <p>You reaſon'd juſtly enough. Ever ſince we had no more of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain's</hi> Aſſiſtance, the Emperour has made no further Advances, and this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:29599:26"/>
may ſerve to prove how neceſſary you were to him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the general Intereſt of the Empire, which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally moved you to embarque in that Affair, you had likewiſe a particular Intereſt of your own to purſue, and that ſo powerfully influenced to make uſe of all Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities againſt the Common Enemy. You hated all ſlow phlegmatick Deliberations, or if they were taken, you gave your ſelf no Repoſe till they were put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. All the World obeyed your Orders with joy. The proſperity of your Arms gave occaſion of Envy but to a ſmall number of diſaffected Men, over whom you triumphed at laſt in the Emperour's Council. He knew you went readily to work, and that you had no Temptation upon you to protract his Affairs by a dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Conduct, ſo he was accuſtomed to follow your Advice, and to ſubmit himſelf to what you judged ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>But what has become all this while of the D. of <hi>Bavaria?</hi> Who, in an Age not ſo far advanced as mine was, has all the Experience and Prudence that is neceſſary to Command the Imperial Forces.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schomberg.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis indeed very true, that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> is a gallant Prince, that he is the Honour, no leſs than the Support of the Empire, and that if his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice had been always exactly followed, the Emperour's Affairs had not been in ſo declining a Condition. But the conſideration of his being ſo young, has been the Reaſon why his Counſels have not been always hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened unto, and why ſeveral of the Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire have refuſed to ſerve under him There have been abundance of Diſputes upon this Subject in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's Councel, and if ſome Perſons in the World might have had their Wills, he had never received the Command of the Imperial Army.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:29599:27"/>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>Give me leave to tell you, That all this Miſchief did not come only from that quarter. I have often repreſented to the Emperour, that it was high time to conclude a Peace with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and if my Advice had been followed, it had been ratified theſe three years ago. It unfortunately happened, that the Emperour's Intereſt at that Juncture ſeem'd to be linked with my own, ſo every body believed that what I ſpoke was out out of a regard to my own particular Advantage, and this was ſufficient to make my Counſel be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide. I would have fain given them to underſtand, that it was not material to the Queſtion, Whether that Peace would be for my own Advantage, or no, for I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to agree with them in that point; but whether the Intereſt of the whole Empire and Emperour did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to make a Peace, and that was the thing I laboured to make appear. But 'twas to no purpoſe; they believed I only ſpoke for my ſelf, and rejected e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that ſeem'd favourable to my Deſigns, and ſo they gave their Opinion for continuing the War. At the ſame time, I deſired them to inform me what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Emperour would draw from thence. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (ſays I) he chaſes the <hi>Turk</hi> even to the Walls of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>; what will he be a farthing the better to make himſelf Maſter of a deſolate uninhabited Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? When at the ſame he has another Enemy at his Back, who, if he pleaſe, may Ravage the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and ruine the better part of <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Schomberg.</speaker>
               <p>The Original of all this Miſchief pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from their having too deſpicable an opinion of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty. I have often ſaid at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the War, that they would be deceived every Man of them in this particular. I have ſerved in <hi>France</hi> all my life time, I have almoſt paſſed through every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:29599:27"/>
of Military Preferment, and at laſt I had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Commanding in Chief. I know very well now the Army is compoſed, and I dare pretend to maintain, that there's a neceſſity not only for all the Forces of the Empire, but of all the Allies into the bargain, to reduce her into moderate bounds. She alone has as great an Army as all the Allies together, and an Army that have ſhew'd upon all Occaſions, that there is not a better in <hi>Europe.</hi> They are paid to the utmoſt exactneſs, and though their pay is not ſo very great, yet the regularity of it atones for the default. They are obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Military Diſcipline to the higheſt Severity, and whoſoever violates the Laws, is puniſhed without any Mercy. The Generals and Officers who Command them, are Men of Courage, Experience, and Honour, and above all, they have an unconceivable Affection and Duty for their Soveraign. The King very exactly recompenſes all thoſe who have deſerved well of him, and puniſhes without diſtinction thoſe that fail in their Duty. One may ſay at the ſame time, that he does not weigh a Man Faults and Services in the ſame Scale; for although you have perfectly acquitted your ſelf in your Duty all your Life before, yet all this is accounted for nothing, if you have been guilty of one notorious Tranſgreſſion. People believe that the King of <hi>France</hi> is in want of Mony, but I could wiſh with all my Soul that the Allies lay under no greater Exigences. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſpends does not depart out of his own Kingdom, his Money only paſſes out of his Hands to his Subjects, and from them Circulates into his own <hi>Exchequer.</hi> In ſhort, as a Man may ſay, that the Councel of <hi>France</hi> is properly compoſed of the King and Monſieur <hi>de Louvois,</hi> ſo 'tis the moſt ſecret Councel in <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as the readieſt.</p>

               <p>I agree to every thing you ſay, but am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad that none of the Dead beſides my ſelf hears you. Upon my word they would take you for a Spy and Creature of <hi>France,</hi> and bring you before one of the Judges here in Hell, or at leaſt raiſe the Mob againſt you.</p>

               <p>I know very well that there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of People in the World that wont allow you to ſpeak a ſyllable of the Puiſſance of the <hi>French</hi> King, and what is very ſurprizing, although they feel every day e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident proofs of it, yet they would oblige a man to ſhut his eyes, that he may perceive nothing. Theſe are the Men that turn the moſt diſadvantageous things to their own advantage and will pretend that the Battle of <hi>Fleurt,</hi> and the Naval Engagement were mighty Bleſſings to the Allies. According to their reckoning <hi>France</hi> is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſolate place, void of Men and Money, and knows not to what Saint to make her Applications under the preſent extremity: After all, I wou'd willingly know what is the intent of all this Diſcourſe, and what they would be at. I could wiſh with all my heart that things were as they give out; and if the publiſhing of them only would render them true, no man ſhould employ his Talent louder againſt <hi>France</hi> than my ſelf. But all this idle ſtuff does not ſignifie a farthing, all our Diſcourſes don't alter the nature of things, and ten thouſand words are not capable of diminiſhing the Armies of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth. I am willing to believe that there are ſome Perſons in the World that ſpeak immoderate things of the Power of that Prince, but then the number of them is ſo inconſiderable, in reſpect of the other Party, that they don't deſerve a formal Confutation. For my own part, if it were neceſſary for me to take one ſide or other, I would rather choſe to be of the former than the latter.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29599:28"/>
Every one knows that nothing is ſo dangerous as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe an Enemy, on the other hand, 'tis but reaſonable to form the moſt advantageous Idea of him. This will oblige us to neglect no opportunity of uſing our utmoſt efforts againſt him, and to take the trueſt and juſteſt meaſures in order to reduce him. I am very well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that it had been better for the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> if they had uſed their greateſt efforts, and if ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who pretend to paſs for Allies, had been of this Opinion. One ought not to be accounted a Penſioner of <hi>France</hi> for ſpeaking after this rate; and 'tis the moſt horrid Injuſtice in the World to draw ſo ill a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis indeed very true what you have ſaid. I will only add, that if it ſhould ever happen that <hi>France</hi> ſhould come by the beſt on't, thoſe Gentleman ought not haſtily to judge the worſt of thoſe Men who were of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother opinion. There are two ſorts of Men in the World: One is full of fire and heat, their Blood boils perpetually within them, and they are apt to imagine that every thing is for their advantage. The other is of a cold and fearful temperament, Faith and Hope have nothing to do in their Conſtitution, I mean as to their beſt Offices, for they always believe and fear the worſt. 'Tis therefore but a piece of Juſtice to attribute thoſe great Idea's which ſome perhaps have entertain'd about the Puiſſance of the <hi>French,</hi> rather to this Spirit of Fear, and Coldneſs of Temperature, than to any deſire to ſee the Enemy triumph, and the Allies be vanquiſhed. But, my dear Duke, 'tis not Reaſon which guides moſt People in the World, they are prejudiced by their Paſſions, they are divided into ſeveral parties; and few, very few are ſo happy as to behold things with diſintereſſed eyes, and with a clear and diſtinct view. When there appears an
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29599:29"/>
unknown Man in Company, who reaſons upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Affairs, we don't amuſe our ſelves ſo far, as to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his Reaſons, to ſee whether they are good or bad; that diſcuſſion would be too troubleſome, and few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons would think it worth their while. We only content our ſelves with conſidering, whether what this unknown Perſon has ſaid, agrees with our Inclinations, or no; If it does, he has Reaſon on his ſide, and cannot deceive us; but if it happen otherwiſe, he's a Penſioner and a Spy without any further trouble. And now to conclude, 'tis very well that none of the Dead underſtands us, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we might meet with a great deal of vexation upon that ſcore.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>Upon my word, it would be a very great trouble to find one of that Character. You muſt know, that Men carry along with them the very ſame Paſſions which they entertained in the other World, into theſe Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and as every one has engaged himſelf more or leſs in one party or another, ſo 'tis a difficult matter to diſtinguiſh them and make them quit their beloved Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.</p>

               <p>WHat, another yet? Sure 'tis a Clymaterick Year for the Enemies of <hi>France:</hi> I am juſt now come from the Ghoſt of the Duke of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and I fancy I perceive that of the Elector <hi>Palatine.</hi>

               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, you are not deceived. 'Tis the very ſame. But I think it is not neceſſary to run to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Stars to give a Reaſon for either of our deaths. I am Threeſcore and five years old; the Duke of <hi>Schomberg</hi> was older, and beſides that at the Head of an Army. There was no occaſion for the Stars to be concern'd in our Deſtiny, or to haſten our Death at this Age. 'Tis nothing but what is very natural; and if <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth is obliged to any thing upon that ſcore, 'tis rather to the number of our Years, than to the Influences of the Planets.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>'Tis very true what you ſay. It is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter to perceive that only Nature is concern'd in theſe Events, but ſtill Nature is too ſimple and obvious a thing for ſome Men: They love Myſteries dearly in every thing, as well as in Religion; and I dare engage, that though there was nothing but what was meerly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>You need not queſtion it. In ſhort, you died of Poiſon. <hi>France</hi> took care to give it you by corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of your Domeſticks, or elſe by diſpatching a Jeſuite to do you that kindneſs, for the World ſays, you had no over great eſteem for that Society.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>Well, but did not thoſe who aſſiſted at my Death, atteſted that I died of a Squinancy?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>Yes: But People anſwer'd again, that 'twas a Report induſtriouſly ſpread to hinder that Secret, and diſguiſe the true Cauſe of your Death. Others ſaid, that there was ſtore of all ſorts of Poiſon in the place where you were, that 'tis the nature of ſome Poiſon to ſuffocate thoſe Perſons that take it; and that 'twas with a Doſe of the latter ſort that you were Regaled.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>Alas! 'twas the former. I ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved upon my word, I really died of a Squinancy; and as for the latter, I leave it to the deciſion of thoſe worthy Gentlemen, the Phyſicians. They are too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious a ſort of Men to be miſtaken in ſo palpable a matter; and methinks I hear them very gravely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Occaſion of my Death was for taking ſome <hi>Suffocativum toxicum.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Nay, let them look to what they ſay. We ſhall not dye the leſs for all that; but nothing grieves me ſo much, as that <hi>France</hi> is like to be a Gainer by our Deaths.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>Likely enough. One may ſay that you and I were the two great Wheels, upon which the whole Affairs of <hi>Germany</hi> turned, and eſpecially all thoſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that were formed againſt the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> It was your Province to concert Matters, as it was mine to put them in execution. You know his moſt Chriſtian
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29599:30"/>
Majeſty in the <hi>Manifesto</hi> which he publiſhed at the laſt Siege of <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> did not fail to acquaint the World, that you had inceſſantly ſollicited all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Europe</hi> to aſſociate againſt him. However, I am in good hopes, that the loſs of you is not irreparable, and that his Electoral Highneſs, your Son, as he has inherited your Eſtate, has alſo inherited the Hatred which you had ſo juſtly entertained againſt <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, and the Authority which you had ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly acquired in the Imperial Court.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>As for his hatred, I have nothing more to ſay to it, but that I ſuppoſe he has enough for his occaſion: But as for the Authority of which you ſpoke, I am afraid whether he is ſo fortunate as to poſſeſs it. The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being the Empreſſes Father gave me a certain Authority, which that of a Brother does not inveſt one with. Beſides, I had been for a long while acquainted with the Imperial Court, I perfectly knew all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues and Methods of it: On the other hand, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Prince, my Son, is but a Novice there, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is not in a capacity of taking the juſteſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures againſt the Enemy of my Family.</p>

               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>You have however this to comfort you, that after all, you lived long enough to ſee an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proviſion made for your Family, though it was ſo numerous. 'Tis about a year ago, ſince you were in danger of quitting this World; but as if Death it ſelf had a mind to favour you, it gave you leiſure enough to marry one of your Daughters to the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> another to the Prince of <hi>Poland,</hi> and to ſecure the Crown of <hi>Portugal</hi> to your Houſe, by obtaining the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta for his Electoral Highneſs your Son.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>The firſt is conſummated, the ſecond is pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well advanced, but the third is clearly broke off.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>Why, you mightily ſurprize me now. From whence I pray proceeded this ſudden Change? Did not the Grand Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order conduct the Queen, your Daughter, into <hi>Spain,</hi> and was he not to touch at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in his way home, to conclude the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Electoral Prince with the Infanta, and carry her along with him into <hi>Germany</hi>?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>All this is very true. The Grand Maſter ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually diſpatched his Buſineſs in <hi>Spain,</hi> and was juſt come to the Frontiers of <hi>Portugal,</hi> when an unexpected Meſſage he received upon the way obliged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back. They made a Report be raiſed that the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it was, becauſe the Grandees of <hi>Portugal</hi> were not as yet reſolved to aſſent to this Buſineſs, but indeed there was another Myſtery in the Caſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>For God's ſake deliver me of my pain, and tell me what it was?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>We were informed that the King of <hi>France</hi> had appear'd in the Market before us, and play'd his Cards ſo well with the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as to obtain the Infanta for the Dauphin his Son</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>And is the Infanta then married to the Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>No, No. At the ſame time when ſhe was ordered to prepare for her Paſſage into <hi>France,</hi> there happened a ſtrange unlooked for Accident, that broke off the March.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>Why, upon the upſhot of the matter, they found that the Infanta had never been conſulted, and that ſhe had diſpoſed of her heart elſewhere.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>I fancy you are in a humour of Raillery. For does not all the World know that the Daughters of Princes are but ſo many Politick Victims, which they uſe to Sacrifice to the Publick Good, without ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting their Inclinations in private; and though we don't ſo much take advice of their Hearts, as of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thing which is Chriſten'd by the Name of <hi>Raiſon d'Etat,</hi> when we diſpoſe of them by way of Marriage. Let the Infanta give her heart to whom ſhe pleaſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſhe'll allow the uſe of her Body to the Spouſe whom the King her Father has provided for her.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>But what will you ſay, if ſhe diſpoſed of her Body, at the ſame time when ſhe gave away her Heart, or if a Clandeſtine Marriage put a ſtop to the procedure. I dare not poſitively affirm that the Caſe was ſo with her. But however it was, the Marriage with the Dauphin was broke off; the Infanta is at preſent in a Convent, and one of the Grandees of the Court loſt his life under a pretence for being concern'd in a certain Intrigue. As for the Electoral Prince, my Son, he is in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he was in, when you left the other World.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>The Adventures of this Princeſs are very ſingular, and I queſtion whether we can furniſh our ſelves with any thing ſo ſurprizing, either in Hiſtory or Romance. She was firſt of all to have been married to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> but he had no great Inclinations for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29599:33"/>
her, and all his Subjects oppoſed it. Many years after this a Match was propoſed between her and the Duke of <hi>Tuſcanies</hi> Son, but the great Duke took care to ſet ſome Invincible Obſtacles in the way. Then they thought of giving her to the Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> but the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> deceived him. After all, that Monarch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her to the Dauphin of <hi>France,</hi> and then ſhe her ſelf ſtept in and oppoſed it. She gave her ſelf to a Grandee of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and that coſt the poor Lover his life; for I perceived very well that that was your meaning, when you firſt made mention of a Grandee of that Court. After ſo many Diſappointments and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky Chances there was no other way left than to make a Retreat. But how comes it about that the Prince of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Marriage with the Princeſs your Daughter has been ſo long protracted, for I thought I left it juſt upon the point of being concluded.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who ſaw how ardently the Emperour deſired that Alliance, has been the only <hi>Remora</hi> in the Buſineſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>Now, I always thought that the Match was no leſs for his Intereſt than his Imperial Majeſties. By this means he could promiſe himſelf to ſecure the Crown to his Son; and what could he deſire more?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>Why in truth the King of <hi>Poland</hi> believed, that it was better to have ſomething that was real and poſitive, than to feed himſelf with Chimera's and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties. He conſidered that I was old, that after my Death the Scene of Affairs might be altered, and that the Affection which the Emperour expreſt for the Match, might hereafter happen to be changed. When it was no longer ſupported by my Authority with him: that as his Imperial Majeſty had a numerous Family, ſo it was not impoſſible, but that he might be prevailed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:29599:33"/>
upon one time or another to prefer one of his own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, before the Prince of <hi>Poland,</hi> who would only be his Brother in Law.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>What could the King of <hi>Poland</hi> demand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>He pretended that they ought to give him <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Malachia,</hi> whoſe Princes you know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned the <hi>Turks</hi> to become Tributaries to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. You are not ignorant how he has had an aking Tooth for thoſe two Provinces this long while ago, and he believed this was a favourable Opportunity to obtain the Poſſeſſion of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lorrain.</speaker>
               <p>And did the Emperour then agree to this Demand?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Elector.</speaker>
               <p>No, No, he was far from liking the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. Thoſe two Provinces, you know, formerly made a part of the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> they are very advantageouſly ſcituated near it, ſo that nothing but meer Conſtraint could ever make the Emperour part with them to <hi>Poland,</hi> now he had them in his hands.</p>

               <p>You know there's ſuch a man in the World as <hi>Teckely</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania.</hi> The <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> lent him an Army to enter that Province; a conſiderable Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Tartars</hi> joyned him. The <hi>Hoſpadars</hi> of <hi>Walachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia</hi> ſeeing him ſo well ſupported, have reaſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their Ancient Engagements, and turned Tail upon the Emperour. His Imperial Majeſty ſeeing himſelf ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abandoned by them, and not in a Condition to keep them any longer in his hands, made no difficulty, they ſay, to reſign them to <hi>Poland,</hi> with this Proviſo, that the two Provinces may make this Ceſſion void, when they judge it expedient.</p>

               <p>You are much in the right.

               <p>To ſay the truth, I am deſperately afraid that Fortune has ceaſed to perſecute the Infidels, and if I had been believed, we had not tarried for the reverſe of our good luck, to accommodate Matters with them. Whatever Sentiments ſome Flatterers may have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed the Emperour with, I am ſure he'll find it a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Task to maintain the War at the ſame time againſt two ſuch formidable Powers as the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Great <hi>Turk.</hi> If he divides his Forces equally, he will be conſtrained to act only on the Defenſive part; and if he employs the better part of his Men on one ſide, he will be in danger of loſing as much that way, as he will gain the other.</p>

               <p>Experience does but too well juſtifie the truth of what you ſay. The whole Campagne was ſpent in defending our ſelves againſt the <hi>French</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Servia.</hi> Yet ſtill it had been ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for us, if we had managed our Game as well as the Enemy has done; but to our ſhame be it ſpoken, we have done nothing at all, even when the Advantage lay on our ſide. The <hi>Dauphin</hi> ordered his Affairs ſo well, as to make his Troops ſubſiſt one part of the Summer in the Enemies Country; and we have a great deal of reaſon to believe that the Infidels will recover <hi>Niſſa, Widin,</hi> and perhaps <hi>Belgrade</hi> it ſelf before the end of the Campagne, without reckoning at the ſame time the progreſs of <hi>Tec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely</hi>'s Arms in <hi>Tranſylvania.</hi>

               <p>TO ſay the truth, I am well enough ſatisfied with this Summers Campagne, and if <hi>James</hi> the Second had ſeconded me, I ſhould reckon this Year amongſt the moſt fortunate Years of my whole Life. In effect, what could I deſire more, being attacked, as I was, on all ſides, almoſt by all the Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> and aſſiſted by none of any regard, than to preſerve my Conqueſts? It would be too great a Preſumption to aſpire after new Victories under ſo many Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Louvois.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis indeed very true, that your Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs has even ſurpaſſed our Expectation. You remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Sir, without queſtion, that we reckon'd upon the loſs of <hi>Philipsburg</hi> and <hi>Montroyal,</hi> and that your Majeſty was of Opinion, we ſhould come off very well, if we were only forced to quit thoſe two places.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
               <p>I remember it full well; but then we never reckoned upon the loſs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and yet you know that Kingdom is as good as gone. And now I am not fully ſatisfied, whether it had not been better for our Affairs to have loſt <hi>Philipsburg</hi> and <hi>Montroyal</hi> to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29599:36"/>
provided we could have kept <hi>Ireland</hi> in our hands ſtill. 'Tis evident, that as long as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had that Bone to pick, he could never think of paſſing the Sea. On the contrary, we muſt expect to ſee him next Summer in <hi>Flanders,</hi> at the Head of a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Army, and I proteſt to you, I have too good an Opinion of him, to imagine that he will loſe any time, in only obſerving the Poſture of my Troops.</p>

               <speaker>M<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> de Louvois.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, Sir, what you ſay is but too true; and I begin to perceive one mighty Fault we have committed, and which is, I am afaid, irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The too good Opinion we had of the King of <hi>England</hi> has ruined all. We believed we could not provide the Army in <hi>Ireland</hi> with a better General, and that is the reaſon, why we were content to ſend the Count <hi>de Lauzun</hi> along with him. If the Buſineſs were to be done again, and you had ordered one of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Generals to croſs the Seas, I much queſtion whether the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had found it ſo eaſie a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to reduce that Iſland.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
               <p>That would not have been ſufficient. For in the firſt place, we muſt have ſent for all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and returned <hi>French</hi> Troops in the room of them. We muſt have given Orders for our Men to work per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in the fortifying all thoſe places which they had judged proper to preſerve, and eſpecially the Sea-port Towns. I own they had time enough to have done all this, and then they had been in a Condition to diſpute every foot of Earth, and to have protracted the War much longer. As for the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> they might have been employed either in Garriſons, or elſe in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> in the room of thoſe Troops that were drawn from thence, where their Courage and Bravery (if they had any) were not in fear of being the worſe for uſing.</p>

               <p>I agree to all that your Majeſty has ſaid. But ſurely, Sir, you have not forgot, how 'twas feared we ſhould utterly forfeit the Affection of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if we put our ſelves abſolutely in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ireland</hi>; and you know we expected no inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable things at that time from what our Friends were able to perform in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>There was, I confeſs, a grand miſtake in the management of that Affair. But 'tis too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it now. I find I have nothing to truſt to but my Sword, and if I were to begin again, I would have ſent ſome Fifty thouſand Men into <hi>England,</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the King there upon his Throne, and preſerve that Crown for him, which he has loſt only by repoſing too great a Confidence in his Subjects. But now that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity is loſt, and we have not ſo much ſpare time upon our Hands as to ſpend it in any impertinent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints for what is paſſed; rather let us make proviſion for what may happen hereafter. Therefore let me know, what is to be done under the preſent Exigences, to diſſipate that Tempeſt that ſo ſecretly threatens to viſit me by the beginning of the next Spring.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Louvois.</speaker>
               <p>The firſt thing you ought to think of in my Opinion, is to ſet on foot as numerous an Army, as is poſſible for you, to reſiſt that mighty Torrent of Enemies which is ready to deſcend upon you. If you ſee it abſolutely impoſſible to maintain the War any longer in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I would adviſe you to draw back, not only the <hi>French</hi> Forces as ſoon as you can, but alſo as many of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> as are willing to continue in your Service. You may find Employment enough for them in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Catalonia.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>Iriſh,</hi> you know, are the worſt Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the World; Employ them in what part of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29599:37"/>
World you will, they are the ſame Men ſtill; Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Ignorance are all their Ingredients. I queſtion whether Men that are ſo hardened and confirmed in running away, will ever do me any good.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Louvois.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, Sir, as you was ſaying before, you may employ them in ſuch places, where there is no probability of any great Action. Beſides, 'tis not utterly impoſſible, but that a little experience in the World may correct the awkwardneſs of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Two Compagnes may perhaps inſpire them with another Spirit. Your Majeſty has formerly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome of that Country in your Armies, and they were not unſerviceable to you. But to quit this Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the principal thing we are to mind, is to make choice of our moſt vigorous and moſt diſciplin'd Troops againſt the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>; for he is the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Enemy we have to deal with. At the ſame time you may amuſe the reſt of the Allies any other ſide your Majeſty pleaſes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
               <p>You are in the right. But the queſtion I would be reſolved in, is, Which way the Prince will turn his Arms after the Reduction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that I may oppoſe him in time with the moſt conſiderable part of my Forces. You know that generally ſpeaking we are never acquainted with his Deſigns, till it is too late to prevent them; and in what an embarras do you think I ſhall be, if at the ſame time when I attend his coming in <hi>Flanders</hi> with a conſiderable Army, he makes a Deſcent upon any of my Provinces. He muſt of courſe be Maſter there, ſince there will be no body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in a Capacity to repel him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Louvois.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt, Sir, ſuch a Caſe would be perplexing enough. But however if you'l permit me to form my own Conjecture, I don't ſee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:29599:37"/>
there's any great probability that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> deſigns to make any ſuch Deſcent, till he has rendred himſelf abſolute Maſter at Sea. He is too prudent and well-adviſed to expoſe his Perſon in a ſtrange Country, without ſecuring a Retreat to himſelf, in caſe he ſhould meet with ill Succeſs. Now, before he can be Maſter of the Seas, 'tis neceſſary for him to gain a Naval Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and then indeed he may have leiſure and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enough to make a Deſcent. But then if ſuch a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune ſhould happen to us, we ſhall have warning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in all Conſcience to withdraw our Forces out of <hi>Flanders</hi> to hinder the Enemies landing. Therefore 'tis my Opinion, that it will be the beſt way to ſet as nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous a Fleet out to Sea, as you equipt the laſt Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagn, with Orders to mind the Safety of the Kingdom, and not to hazard any thing by way of Engagement, unleſs they are as good as ſecured before hand of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. This is the only way, as I imagine, to obviate the Misfortune of an Invaſion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
               <p>There's ſome comfort in what you ſay, but 'tis not ſufficient to cure all my Apprehenſions. I have a vaſt extent of Land to guard, ſo that when my Fleet is buſie in one place, that of my Enemies will have Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity enough to make a Deſcent in another. Beſides, I am afraid of the Diſcontents of my People, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the new Converts, who, without diſpute, will joyn the Enemy as ſoon as ever he Lands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Louvois.</speaker>
               <p>Now in my Opinion, this laſt Fear or Jealouſie of yours is but ill grounded: The number of Malecontents is not ſo great as you imagine, and it will be no eaſie matter for thoſe Perſons who are ſo affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to execute their wicked Deſigns. As for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the large Extent of your Coaſts, ſuppoſe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent were never ſo large, yet for all that a Deſcent is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29599:38"/>
not ſo eaſily made. Let but your Fleet watch the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Enemies Fleet, and purſue them whether they go, and I dare engage you'll go near to ruine their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
               <p>Let us put the Caſe then, The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> does not intend to make a Deſcent upon us, but that <hi>Flanders</hi> will be the Scene of his greateſt Efforts, by what means ſhall I be able to reſiſt the Forces and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of that Prince?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Louvois.</speaker>
               <p>You have ſo many fortified places on that ſide, than you may very well allow to Sacrifice two or three of them, in order to ſave the reſt. In the mean time to render every Siege more difficult, you muſt take care to prevent the Enemy, you muſt enter the Field in the beginning of the Spring; you muſt demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh all thoſe Places, and ravage all that Country, where you imagine the Enemy will come to Encamp. In fine, 'twill be your beſt Policy, to act all the remainder of the Year only on the Defenſive part.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
               <p>I own I have fortified Places enough. But there's one which a Man cannot fail to make himſelf Maſter of as ſoon as he opens his Campagn, leaving the other Towns behind him. I know very well, my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have no deſign to meddle with any Sieges, but where 'tis neceſſary ſo to do, in order for them to enter the heart of my Kingdom; and therefore there's a great deal of probability, that unleſs I oppoſe them there, they will immediately beſiege that place I was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off. Now what Remedies ſhall we apply in this Caſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Louvois.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive 'tis <hi>Philipville</hi> you mean. But the place, as I take it, is ſtrong enough, and in all appearance, if it is furniſhed with a ſufficient Garriſon, and every thing neceſſary for a Siege, the Enemies, let
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:29599:38"/>
them be never ſo furious, will find Entertainment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough there for the whole Compagn. Therefore if they ſit down before the Siege of it, it muſt be our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to endeavour to raiſe it. We will leave in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> but juſt as many Troops as will be neceſſary to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Imperialiſts, and ſo having united our Forces, we ſhall be in a better Capacity to relieve the place.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Louis.</speaker>
               <p>I have very often found my account in theſe different Marches and Countermarches, which I have order'd my Armies to make. By this means I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Enemy, and in ſome manner have ſupplied and made out the ſmall numbers of my men. But then you'll grant me, that theſe Movements weary my Forces exceedingly, and that if this hard Service were to continue any time, it would be altogether inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Louvois.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis a long while ago ſince I have been ſenſible of this Inconvenience, but 'tis impoſſible to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it. All that we can do, is to make the Souldier a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends in his Winter Quarters, where he ſhall not be obliged to undergo any Fatigues, but may have full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to enjoy that repoſe, which was denied him in the Summer. The Burghers will ſuffer any thing, and reaſon good, ſince you preſerve them in their Lives and Properties from the Invaſion of the Enemy. There are other ways beſides to recompence theſe extraordinary Services of the Souldiers, as by taking care to provide them all Neceſſaries at a reaſonable rate as long as they are incamped, and this will encourage them to paſs by the ſeverity of the other duty. As for the Cavalry, by means of theſe Magazines, and the great exactneſs with which the Camp is managed, there will be no occaſion for them to forrage at any Diſtance, and ſo the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which is ſpared them on this ſide, is ſupplied

               <p>Although the Remedies you have mentioned will not be able to avert all thoſe Miſchiefs that my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies have deſigned me, yet I perceive they'll ſerve to alleviate them, and that is all we can propoſe to our ſelves. So I will trouble you no more for what concerns <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Deſigns of the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> But what think you of the <hi>Germans?</hi>

               <speaker>M. de Louvois.</speaker>
               <p>I can only tell you, that if a Peace had been concluded with the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the Princes that compoſe that great Body, would underſtand their own Intereſt, you'd have more reaſon to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of them, than the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> But 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happy for us, that it is impoſſible for ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Heads, that purſue ſo many different Intereſts, ever to agree as they ſhould. I ſay, that purſue ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different Intereſts: for to do them juſtice, if one does not ſee that exact harmony in their Councels, which ought to reign there, 'tis not ſo much an effect of the ill humour of the Princes that compoſe thoſe Aſſemblies, as of the nature of the things themſelves, as I could eaſily make it appear. There are ſome ingenious Politicians who have been pleaſed to maintain, that 'tis a perfect Miracle how <hi>Germany</hi> could ſubſiſt as long as it has done, under that feeble unactive ſort of Government, to which it is ſubjected. Let it be how it will, one may preſume to ſay, that the <hi>Germans</hi> want nothing, but to be re-united under one General, and if that ſhould ever happen, why then Good night to the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy. They are without contradiction the braveſt Souldiers in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and their Cavalry is incomparably Good. Their Country is abundantly ſtocked with Men and Horſes, and both the one and the other are a great deal more
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29599:39"/>
indefatigable than the Men and Horſes of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>'Tis indeed very true. But I have one great Advantage over them, that their ſlowneſs renders all their other good Qualities unſerviceable.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>M. de Louvois.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs they are ſomewhat ſlow; but one ought not to attribute that ſlowneſs ſo much to the temperature of their Bodies, as to the principal Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience I remarked in their Conſtitution, that is to ſay, the great number of Soveraign Princes under whom they live: For as an excellent Author has very well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Where there's a neceſſity for ſeveral Heads, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hands to execute a Deſign, Affairs move but very ſlowly, and there's more time ſpent to agree upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of acting, than in the execution it ſelf.</hi> What I have ſaid, may be proved from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> are not ſo ſlow as the <hi>Germans,</hi> although they are in a manner of the ſame Conſtitution, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe they are all united under one general Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour that haſtens their Reſolutions. But to come back to what I have diſcourſed of ſo largely, as their ſlowneſs is an incurable Diſtemper, ſo 'tis an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſtep to you to facilitate your Deſigns upon them. You may very eaſily hinder a Peace with the <hi>Turk,</hi> by aſſiſting <hi>Teckely</hi> under Hand, and by furniſhing the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> with skilful Engineers for Sieges. This in all probability will gain him ſome advantageous Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs upon the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> and conſequently will take off the diſguſt of the War.</p>

               <p>I wonder they never did all this while, and I cannot attribute it to any thing elſe, but to an Exceſs of Prudence, that will not permit them to run any hazard, before they are aſſured of Succeſs. I dare engage that your Majeſty would not have taken theſe meaſures, you would have adventured to truſt Fortune with the matter, you would have forced the Paſſes, and then pacified the <hi>Swiſs Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> with ſome colourable Excuſes, after they had been forced.</p>

'Tis not for Warriers to be guilty of any Formalities, and a Prince at the Head of an Army, is not obliged to have the Map al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in his Hand, to take care that he never ſets foot in the Ground of his Allies.

               <p>Not to loſe any precious time, but immediately to ſeize on the Forreſt Towns, for fear your Enemies ſhould prevent you. You will avoid by this means two great Misfortunes that ſeem to threaten you, I mean, the entrance of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> by the way of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Switzers.</hi> For 'tis not to be preſumed they will dare to abandon your Party, when they ſee themſelves environed on every ſide by your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>

'Tis not ſo very long, ſince you looked upon your ſelves as a ruined People, when the King of <hi>France,</hi> at the ſollicitation of the Biſhop and Canons of <hi>Annecy,</hi> would have taken your Tythes from you. You continued to work with all the diligence imaginable upon your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications. You implored our Aſſiſtance, and you gave out that you expected the <hi>French</hi> Army every minute before your Walls. But after all, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done: Whether ſome unexpected Accidents hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that alter'd the Deſigns of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth; or whether he had no mind to Attack you at that time, you were ſoon deliver'd of your Fear. And now when the War is kindled ſo very near you, between the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and that Monarch, you believe you are in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecure Condition, when at the ſame time you are in more dangerous Circumſtances than ever.

               <p>I agree to the Maxims you have eſtabliſhed: but I don't at all ſee the Juſtice of your Application. 'Tis true, we lay under ſome Apprehenſions formerly, and perhaps we had no very good Grounds for them: And now, I confeſs, we divert our ſelves with the Quarrels between the Court of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and if it concerned no Body but us, we ſhould not fail on our ſides to pour Oyl on the fire. But as ſmall an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination as we have for that Duke, yet we countenance his Party under hand. One of our Captains is in his Service with a whole Company; we have privately liſted as many <hi>Refugèes,</hi> nay of our own Subjects too, as were willing to be employed in the Valleys. But we are not afraid, that this will bring us into any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire, ſince we don't do it above-board, and the World knows nothing of the matter. 'Tis indeed very certain, that ſince the <hi>French</hi> hath come up to our very Gates, and have poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Chablais,</hi> we have been ſomewhat cautious of the main Chance; but upon the whole, we are ſatisfied that we have no Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of fear, ſince the Reſident of <hi>France</hi> has aſſured us of his Maſter's good Intentions, as alſo Monſieur <hi>de Saint Rut,</hi> who Commands the Troops of the moſt Chriſtian King.</p>

               <p>My Fears are founded upon two Reaſons. The firſt is, that it ſeems almoſt impoſſible to me, but we muſt of neceſſity break with <hi>France</hi> before the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29599:42"/>
Concluſion of the War. That Crown, wholly puff'd up with the Advantages they have lately had over their Enemies, begins to ſpeak in a louder voice, then he has hitherto uſed. She openly complains of the <hi>Evangelick Cantons,</hi> and will not allow them the liberty of a free People, to act as they judge expedient. In fine, ſhe ſees they are not devoted to their Intereſt, that they are not influenced by her Counſels, and that they are not Friends to depend upon. If to lend four thouſand Men to his Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> at the ſame time when we refuſe the <hi>French</hi> to make up any new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits amongſt us; if to give liberty to thoſe that are ſo inclined, to paſs through our Territories to <hi>Piedmont</hi>; if to allow Conveniences to thoſe <hi>Refugees,</hi> who are in the Vallies, to pour themſelves into the <hi>Dauphine,</hi> when they ſee occaſion; if to prohibit their own Troops, who are in pay, to ſerve in any other places, but what were actually poſſeſſed by the King in 1663. are not infallible Evidences that we are no Allies of <hi>France,</hi> but that we ſeek every Occaſion to declare againſt them, why then I am miſtaken in my Meaſures, and you may rally me upon that ſcore as long as you pleaſe.</p>

               <p>I agree to every thing you ſay, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this is ſo far from giving us any juſt Reaſons to be apprehenſive of Danger, that on the contrary, it confirms our Security. For in fine, after you have once declared, you will be obliged to ſupport us, and there is no appearance to believe, that the King of <hi>France,</hi> who has ſo many powerful Enemies to deal with, will come to beſiege a City, which will coſt him a great deal of time, and abundance of Men.

Perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like this may befall your Republick, and that without falling upon either <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, or the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> theſe two Princes may come to agree at your Expence and Sorrow. You need not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that both of them have a great longing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy your City, and particularly the Duke, who looks upon you as no other than a pack of rebellious graceleſs Subjects, who have withdrawn your ſelves from your Allegiance. Now may it not ſo fall out, that the King, to gratifie that Prince, may ſometime or other deliver you into his hands? I fancy now I have ſaid nothing, but what is agreeable to reaſon.</p>

               <p>Such a thing might happen, I confeſs, if 'twere the King's Intereſt to make the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> great; but you know 'tis his Intereſt to keep him as low as may be, and the Caſe being ſo, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver permit him to make himſelf Maſter of ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a place as <hi>Geneva.</hi>

               <p>What you ſay ſeems probable enough at firſt ſight.

Afterwards, you know ſome occaſion or other may preſent it ſelf to make him retake that which he has given: But as you rightly obſerve, that would be no great Comfort to you, it would only make you change the manner of your Slavery, and not be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to your former liberty.</p>

               <p>Pray don't talk of that matter. I cannot think of it without being ſenſibly afflicted. Can you inform me what would happen, in Caſe we ſhould judge it expedient to recall them? The better part of them, finding themſelves better in <hi>France</hi> than they would be at home amongſt us, would refuſe to obey our Summons; and judge you what a terrible Mortification it would be to us, to ſee they are rather the Subjects of the moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, than ours. Beſides, 'tis not to be doubted, but that the King would keep them as Priſoners of War, but eſpecially all ſuch as ſhould entertain any Deſigns of coming home, and thoſe to be ſure would be the ſmalleſt number.</p>

               <p>HIS Holineſs has told me a hundred times, that the fear he has of quitting the World before he ſees a general Peace concluded amongſt the Chriſtian Princes, will certainly haſten his Death; and I can aſſure you, you have no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way to make your Court to him, than by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the King your Maſter to Sacrifice all his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Intereſts for the good of Chriſtendom.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>The King will be ready to make a Peace at any time, but then he ought not to be affronted; he will never endure that. They are mightily miſtaken in their reckoning, that believe the prodigious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Enemies, whom he has upon his hands, can make him loſe an Ace of his Reſolution and Courage. 'Tis on the other hand apparent, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands his own Strength a great deal better than ever he did; and the Caſe being ſo, he is not a Prince that you can ſuppoſe guilty of making a falſe ſtep.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>Let him never demand a Peace, ſay I, but till he pleaſes: yet let him not at the ſame time reject the mediation of thoſe Princes, who are not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:29599:46"/>
engaged in the War, and who declare their Inclinations to procure it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>The King, my Maſter, has never refuſed to liſten to ſuch a Propoſal. But 'tis worth your while to obſerve, that the Enemies, who have declared War againſt him, are of two ſorts. One is compoſed of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> the other of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Now the beſt way to procure a Peace, is to divide theſe two Intereſts, and to oblige the Catholicks to agree with <hi>France,</hi> and unite themſelves in a ſtrict League with her, in order to reduce or deſtroy all the Heretick Princes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>That Conſideration of yours is not amiſs: and I dare engage that this Holineſs never examined your Advice well enough to conceive that that was the bottom of your Deſign. You may believe, that no body deſires the Suppreſſion of Hereſie more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately than my ſelf, and if it would coſt me the better half of my Blood to put it in Execution, I would part with it very freely: But, Sir, you muſt give me leave to tell you, that this Deſign is no ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but a man may ſee tis impoſſible to effect it, at leaſt as the World goes now: and therefore that is the reaſon I abandon it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>Why do you ſay 'tis impoſſible? In my Opinion now nothing appears more feaſible. The more Intereſts you have to manage, the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult you'll find it to conclude a Treaty, and I dare ſay, 'tis a harder matter to conclude a Peace amongſt all the Chriſtian Princes, than a particular Peace with the Catholick Princes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>What you ſay is true in the general; but there are abundance of particular Occaſions, where 'tis an eaſier matter to adjuſt ſeveral Intereſts, than to accommodate a few. The firſt and principal
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29599:46"/>
Obſtacle to the Deſign you have propoſed, is this; I queſtion whether the Proteſtant Princes, who are wiſe and politick enough, did not take ſome ſecret Meaſures that are unknown to us, at the time when they made a League againſt <hi>France,</hi> in caſe they ſhould ever happen to be deſerted and abandoned by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Princes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>For my part, I don't know, what Meaſures they could take; but it appears to me, they are not able to think of one Expedient that can prevent this Inconvenience. In ſhort, we don't ſee that ſo much as one of the Catholick Princes, has ſurrendred any ſtrong Place to the Proteſtants, by way of Security for what they promiſed; and I am inclined to believe, they have given no other Aſſurance but their bare Word.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>Suppoſing what you ſay were true, yet ſtill 'twill be a difficult matter to break the Union. The Emperour, who is Head of the Catholick Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is too religious an Obſerver of his Word, ever to be induced to violate it; and you know, he has ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly promiſed not to make a Peace, until they are comprehended in it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>He has engaged his word, you ſay, and what of all that? As if ſuch feeble Obligations did not always give way to the Intereſt, or as if Intereſt were not able to ſurmount all other Conſiderations. Come, come, you may take my word for it, if ever the Emperour finds his Account in a particular ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Peace, he'll make no Conſcience of leaving the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes in the lurch.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>You diſcourſe now like a Miniſter of <hi>France,</hi> and I am not at all obliged to believe you. But not to engage in any impertinent Diſputes, that will never come to an end; I will content my ſelf to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:29599:47"/>
offer you one only Reaſon, which to me ſeems unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, why 'tis impoſſible to diſengage the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes from the Proteſtants, in order to make a particular Peace with the firſt. And 'tis this, That if you except the Intereſts of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the other Princes of that Religion have nothing in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to adjuſt with <hi>France,</hi> and ſo it would be no hard matter to incline them to a Peace. On the contrary, the Catholick Princes have the juſteſt Pretenſions in the World againſt the King your Maſter, and ſuch too, that he will find it a very ſevere Mortification to ſatisfie. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> only demand Liberty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; the <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> deſires nothing but the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Dutchy of <hi>Cleve.</hi> The Princes of <hi>Lune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> and <hi>Heſſe</hi> have ſcarce any other Motive to the War, but the common Intereſt of the Empire: 'Tis the ſame Caſe with the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> and the reſt of the Proteſtant Princes. But then as for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes, the Emperour demands the Reſtitution of <hi>Philipsburg, Brisgau,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Alſatia.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> puts in for the Dutchy of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> for all the late Acquiſitions in <hi>Flanders,</hi> for the <hi>Franche-Comte, Perignan,</hi> and ſeveral other conſiderable places beſides. The Princes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> demand to be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their Dukedom; the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> to have ſatisfaction made him for all the Damages he has ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained in the War, which, you know, will amount to an infinite Sum. The three Eccleſiaſtick Electors pretend the very ſame thing. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> demands to have <hi>Caſal</hi> demoliſhed, and <hi>Pignerol</hi> reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, beſides all that has been taken from him of late<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus, you ſee, 'tis a far eaſier thing for the moſt Chriſtian King to make a particular Peace with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes, than with the Catholick.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:29599:47"/>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>I own, that if all theſe Princes, whom you have mentioned, continued firm to their Reſolutions, there's no ſuch thing as a Peace to be expected. The King my Maſter, is not in the humour to reſtore ſo eaſily all that he has taken from his Enemies; and I don't ſee at preſent how they will be able to regain them by force. But, Sir, now we are between our ſelves, do you think that theſe Pretenſions are juſt? You know, without queſtion, that the moſt celebrated Lawyers have always placed the right of Conqueſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt lawful Rights: whence it follows, that a man is not conſtantly obliged to reſtore that, which he has conquered by way of force, but may ſtill keep it in his hands, if he ſo pleaſes, and juſtly enough. Therefore I don't ſee by what right they would have the King refund what he has taken,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>What you ſay is certainly true, provided the Conqueſts you make were done during the Courſe of a lawful War. But now theſe perſons pretend, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth did unjuſtly declare War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Neighbours, only to have a better opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of plundering them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>That is the chief Queſtion indeed: but 'tis ſuch a difficult perplext Queſtion, that it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a great deal of trouble to decide it. I am not a fit man to engage in the Controverſie, but this I will ſay, One invincible Argument to me, that part of the King's Conqueſts were made in the Courſe of a lawful War, is becauſe they were totally yielded up to him in ſubſequent Treaties. Nevertheleſs, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Repoſe of Chriſtendom, the moſt Chriſtian King would do well to reſolve to make ſome kind of Satisfaction to the Catholick Princes; and if you'll be pleaſed to give me the hearing, I will tell you
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:29599:48"/>
in a few words, what I think upon this Subject.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall liſten to you with a great deal of ſatisfaction.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>To begin then where you left off. I don't believe the King will ever be prevailed upon to comply with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Pretenſions. 'Tis a long while ago ſince he has had <hi>Pignerol</hi> in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; and beſides, that is a place of too great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be given away. As for <hi>Caſal,</hi> you know it has coſt him a world of Money, 'tis true his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney may be repaid him, but I queſtion whether he will be brought to take it, ſince he has more occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for that Fortreſs, than for Money. Thus all that can be done in the matter, comes to this, the Duke perhaps may be re-inſtated in the poſſeſſion of all thoſe places, that have been taken from him ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the War.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>But cannot the King be at leaſt perſwaded to give him that ſmall ſatisfaction, as to let <hi>Geneva</hi> fall into his Hands. His Holineſs earneſtly deſires ſuch a thing, you know.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>I am not acquainted with his Majeſties Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon that Article: But to tell you what I think, the King is ſo mightily diſpleaſed with the Dukes late behaviour, that I doubt whether he will give him that ſatisfaction. However if 'tis poſſible to make him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends with ſomething elſe of equal Importance, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it may ſucceed at laſt, provided it will give no great Offence to the <hi>Suiſs Cantons.</hi> And now in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on, this is all that can be done to content the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> As for the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> 'tis to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to think of them, for nothing but abſolute Force will oblige the King to make a Reſtitution of that Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Beſides that, their Country lies ſo conveniently
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:29599:48"/>
for <hi>France,</hi> the former Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> have given ſuch juſt re-iterated Provocations to the moſt Chriſtian Kings, that they would fill a large Volume. Now who queſtions but that little Princes are obliged to pay all manner of Reſpect to great Princes who are their Neighbours, and that we may lawfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs them of their Territories, when for want of a due ſubmiſſion they offer to inſult over us, and pretend to ſtand upon even ground.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>The Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> are Soveraigns born, and were always looked upon as Independant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. They were at liberty to make Alliances with whom they pleaſed. And 'tis very unjuſtly done of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> to quarrel with theſe Dukes for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Emperour's Intereſts before theirs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>They are not only content to unite themſelves with th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> but always endeavoured to raiſe Civil Wars in that Kingdom, by ſupporting and countenancing all the Male-contents. But let this paſs when they did nothing elſe but take the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi>'s part againſt <hi>France,</hi> that was ſufficient to juſtifie the Conduct of the moſt Chriſtian Kings as to this reſpect. 'Tis not for one of your petty Princes to engage himſelf in any Party, unleſs he's conſtrained to do it through Violence, and when he ceaſes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an exact Neutrality, 'tis not without Juſtice that he's puniſhed by him, whom he abandons.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>I am not fully convinced of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe Maxims. But, in a word, is there no way in the World to ſatisfie theſe young Princes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>There was formerly a Propoſal made to make them amends in Money, on this Condition, that they would for ever renounce all manner of Pretenſions to the Dukedom of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> I don't know whether
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:29599:49"/>
the King is in the Humour now to gratifie them that way. But however, there's no great harm in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it.</p>

               <p>As for what relates to the <hi>Franche-Comte,</hi> 'tis a Spot of Ground ſo far ſeparated from the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſtands ſo prettily for the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of <hi>France,</hi> that I believe the King my Maſter will never be content to part with it. The ſame may be ſaid concerning the Dutchy of <hi>Luxemburgh,</hi> which we coveted ſo long a time. 'Tis an Eſtate of ſo great an Importance, as well for guarding our Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, as opening a Paſſage into <hi>Germany,</hi> that nothing but Force can get it out of our Hands. As for what concerns the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> may be better accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, and in order to ſettle a laſting Peace, we may well enough conſent to the demoliſhing of ſome places that chiefly incommode the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ought not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any Satisfaction, ſince he has not been inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt needs own, this is a pretty way of making a man amends. You have ruined his whole Country, demoliſhed his Epiſcopal Palace, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled his Fortifications, burnt his Towns, turned his whole Eſtate into one continued Deſart.

               <p>Is it poſſible then, that theſe are all the Advances the King of <hi>France</hi> is willing to make, in Caſe the Catholick Princes are reſolved to make a ſeparate Peace with him, and not comprehend the Proteſtants in it?</p>

               <p>What I have ſaid, is only out of my own Head, and I am not certain whether the King would approve of it, or no. Our great Monarch is ſtrong enough to give a great deal of Diſturbance to his Enemies; and nothing will ſooner oblige him to conclude a Peace, than that he believes, it will be far more neceſſary and advantageous for them, than for himſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>Upon my word, if that be all, you need not give your ſelf the trouble to enter into any Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation. The Catholick Princes, that are leagued together, have too certain a proſpect of advancing their own reſpective Intereſts, to content themſelves with ſuch pitiful Overtures</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>I ſee you make no reckoning of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage they'll receive by uniting themſelves with the King, to exterminate the Proteſtant Princes, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Spoil between them.</p>

               <p>One muſt be a very inſenſible perſon indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be cajoled with ſtupid Rhetorick. The Proteſtant Princes are at preſent the right Arm of the Emperour to defend him againſt the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your King: How then can he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to ſacrifice them? I wiſh you would inform me what the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> were able to do without the Aſſiſtance of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the <hi>Electors,</hi> and other <hi>Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</hi> Don't they ſuſtain the greateſt part of the Burthen of the War; and ſince, with all theſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhe finds it difficult enough to reſiſt your King, what would ſhe do, I pray, if ſhe were deprived of all theſe Supports.</p>

               <speaker>Duke.</speaker>
               <p>But if the Hereticks were once deſtroyed, the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> would enrich herſelf with their Spoils, and all their Forces would become hers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cardinal.</speaker>
               <p>That would not be amiſs, I own, if ſhe were to reap all the benefit, but would not your King, do you think, come in for his ſhare of the Spoils? Is it not very certain, that being the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by much, he would reſerve the Lion's Portion for himſelf? And ſo then, when the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> would fortifie her ſelf on one ſide, your King would do the ſame on the other; in ſuch manner that this new acquired Power would be ten times worſe ballanced, than it is at preſent. After all, when every thing comes to be conſidered, 'tis the Emperour's Intereſt not to ſuffer the Proteſtants to be run down, at leaſt under the preſent Exigences. If that Houſe ſhould find it ſelf in proceſs of time as powerful as it has formerly been, why then ſhe may think of Extirpating Hereſie. But then 'tis to be feared, the Hereticks alſo would change ſides, and that in order to keep the Scales even, they would make their Applications to <hi>France.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt never think of ſeparating the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes from the Proteſtants, with whom they have made ſo ſtrict a Confederacy. But now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a general Peace, what expedient can you find out to adjuſt the Affairs of <hi>England?</hi>

               <p>This is without diſpute the moſt difficult Point of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I don't ſee how we could at the ſame time ſatisfie the King my Maſter, and the Allies, upon this Article, if a particular Peace with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Princes were propoſed.</p>

               <p>You ſay right, 'tis indeed very perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is more embarraſſing of it ſelf than all the Pretenſions of the other Princes, the Allies. 'Tis not to be ſuppoſed, that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> has a mind to deſcend from the Throne, to which he was ſo deſervedly elevated. He muſt either periſh in the Poſt where he is, or maintain it ſtill. There is no middle way. The Church, and Catholick Princes would be covered with everlaſting ſhame, ſhould they abandon a King who ſacrificed himſelf for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Liberty. How then can this matter be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated? I only ſee one way, and that is, to oblige the King of <hi>England</hi> to Abdicate his Crown volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. He has a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> ſtill to manage his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts after him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> can aſſure you, the King will never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon his Allie, and if a Peace is not to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without ſacrificing that unfortunate Prince, he will by no means agree to it. He has too great a reſpect for his own Honour, to make ſo inglorious and ſo baſe a Compliance.</p>

               <p>You had better ſay for his Intereſt; for all the World knows, he never was guilty of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try towards the former. I can only add, That 'tis not along of him that the King of <hi>England</hi> was not eſtabliſhed in his Throne; but one cannot condemn in the ſame Breath the Levity of a Nation, that had not courage enough to ſupport their lawful Prince, and the Cowardize of a Prince, who durſt not ſhow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before his Enemies.</p>

            <head>DIALOGUE IX. </head>
            <stage>The young Prince <hi>Abafti.</hi> Count Teckely.</stage>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Abafti.</speaker>
               <p>IS it then true, that after all the Obligations you had to the Prince my Father, you could be ſo horribly ungrateful, as to enter thoſe Territories, which he left me, with your Army, to the end that you may render your ſelf Maſter of them, to my Prejudice? Surely you have not forgot how ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able he was to you at the beginning of the War, when you declared againſt the Emperour of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> You had as free a Command of his Troops, as if they had been your own; and perhaps if he had not eſpouſed your Quarrel, you would not be in a Condition at this preſent, to ſeize that Principality which of right belongs to me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Teckely.</speaker>
               <p>You are much miſtaken, young Prince, in talking ſo hotly with me, and I would Anſwer you after your own manner, if I did not conſider, that 'tis not ſo much you that Diſcourſes, as the <hi>Germans</hi> in you, upon whom you have made your ſelf ſo ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh a Dependant. You need not refreſh my memory with the good Offices your Father has done me, and though the end did not Anſwer the beginning, ſince
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:29599:52"/>
at laſt he cloſed with my Enemies, and joyned his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with theirs, yet I ſhall ever preſerve the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his mighty Obligations, becauſe I am willing to attribute his laſt Failures rather to the violence of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and meer neceſſity, then his own Inclination. If I have entred <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> in Arms, 'tis not ſo much againſt you, as the Emperour, for he is the true Maſter of that Province, you are only a poor Titular Prince. Beſides, you know the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> my Maſter, and the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> have all along had great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes, which of them it was who had the right to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate a Prince to the <hi>Tranſilvanians,</hi> and 'twas to the former that the Prince your Father ow'd his Elevation. He cauſed him to be elected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notwithſtanding all the Intrigues and Cavelling of the Emperour and the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> He likewiſe has made me to be advanced to this Dignity, and you cannot diſpute the Right of my Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without calling into queſtion that Prince's Title, to whom you owe your Birth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Abafti.</speaker>
               <p>That Conſequence of yours is none of the juſteſt. I own the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> employ'd his credit to get my Father Elected Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> but at the ſame time he never pretended to conſtrain the States to make that Choice. They had an entire Liberty of Voting as they pleaſed, and it was only the Plurality of Voices that Advanced him to that Dignity. But as to your own Caſe, the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> has not ſo much as conſulted the <hi>Tranſylvanians,</hi> and 'tis his Authority alone that has eſtabliſhed all your Right.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Teckely.</speaker>
               <p>I own the States never elected me, but the reaſon is, becauſe they had no permiſſion ſo to do, but were obliged to ſubmit to the ſevere Laws and Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Conquerours. However the Event has ſhown, that if they had been left to their own Freedom,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:29599:53"/>
they would have choſe no other Soveraign than my ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Abafti.</speaker>
               <p>That, I confeſs, I am ignorant of; and, it may be, you'll find it no eaſie matter to prove.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Teckely.</speaker>
               <p>I perceive then you are unacquainted with what happen'd at the Attack of General <hi>Heuſler</hi>'s Army: and that, being only a Titular Prince as you are, they take no great care to inſtruct you in your own Affairs. You are to underſtand, that as ſoon as we came to blows, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> kill'd your Father's great Miniſter, who commanded them in chief, that they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their heels without ſtriking a blow, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the <hi>Germans</hi> to the Fury of my Troops, who almoſt cut them all to pieces. After all this, I leave you to judge, whether I had not reaſon to ſay, that if the <hi>Tranſylvani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have not elected me for their Prince, it only proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their not being at Liberty to do it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Abafti.</speaker>
               <p>What you have told me ſurprizes me extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and I am not able to divine the Reaſon. The People, I am ſure, had no occaſion to complain of the Prince my Father, ſince he always govern'd them with extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prudence and dexterity. I need not recount to you the ſeveral Artifices he made uſe of, to deliver them from the ſlavery that threatned them. He entertained the Emperour, during thoſe three years the War conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, with the faireſt promiſes in the World, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand neglected no Meaſures or Expedients, in order to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the falling under his power. At laſt, when it was neceſſary for him to ſubmit to this Violence, he expreſſed ſo much ſorrow, that it was evident he was more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at the Calamities of his People, than his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Misfortunes. Certain I am, that the weight of theſe Troubles haſten'd his death. And now would any Man in the World believe that the <hi>Tranſylvanians</hi> could prove ſuch ungrateful Wretches, as to prefer a Stranger
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:29599:53"/>
before the Son of that Prince, to whom they have ſuch numerous Obligations?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Teckely.</speaker>
               <p>I think 'tis no wonder at all, if the People for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Reſpect they owe to the memory of Prince <hi>Abaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> for you are not to expect Gratitude amongſt the Mobb. They ſeldom reflect on what is good and paſt. 'Tis only the preſent Scene of Affairs they conſidered.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Abafti.</speaker>
               <p>But pray tell me, what greater Advantages could they propoſe to themſelves under your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than they could expect to find under mine?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Teckely.</speaker>
               <p>To ſay the truth, they don't ſo much conſider the Merits of the Prince himſelf, as of the hand that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him. They have ten times a greater Averſion to the Emperour, than the <hi>Grand Seigneur,</hi> and that is the reaſon why they will be always inclined to favour the Prince that is recommended to them by the latter. If the Emperour had made choice of me, and the <hi>Grand Seigneur</hi> had ſupported your Pretenſions, I don't queſtion but they would have ſhown you the ſame favour they now expreſs for me.</p>

            <sp>
