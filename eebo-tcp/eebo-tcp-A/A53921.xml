         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Believe nothing has ſo much obſtructed the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Art of Phyſick, as the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Humour of Romancing on the Nature and the Cauſes of Diſeaſes: For in many of our modern Authors, the greateſt part of the Paper is waſted about flouriſhing a Whimſoe, to make it paſs for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Suppoſition (and hence the noble Art is term'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural) ſo that in ſome of them ſcarce a Page can be ſpared for the Cure, that which is the main of the Buſineſs being huddled up or touch'd on by the by. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Reaſon and Argument are not the true Teſts of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, nor indeed of any thing elſe, when Experience, the great Baffler of Speculation, can determine the Matter. And, which is ſtrange, this unkind uſage of the Art is privileg'd by a ſort of Men, who are ſet apart for the well ordering of Phyſick; and theſe Broachers of Whimſies, dignified with the Titles of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Virtuoſo's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, the following plain Practice must expect but cold Entertainment with the ſpeculative Phyſician; but ſuch as mind and ſtudy Practice, will, I queſtion not, patronize the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking; when, upon the peruſal, they find in this One Treatiſe, the Sum and Subſtance of ſeveral voluminous Authors; it being a Collection of ſuch Methods and Medicines, as I thought beſt and most uſeful: But it is chiefly deſign'd for young Practiſers, and may ſerve as their <hi>Vade Mecum,</hi> where they may readily turn to any Diſeaſe, and at once view the Diagnoſticks and Cure.</p>
            <p>And here it may not be improper to add briefly, for the Benefit of young Phyſicians, ſome Directions relating to Study and Practice. And, first, ſpend not too much time upon Anatomy, Chymiſtry and Herbs; for tho'
<pb facs="tcp:65404:5"/>
the knowledge of theſe is not only ornamental but uſeful too, yet if you conſume the greatest part of your time in theſe Preliminaries, you will be as foppiſh as thoſe young Sparks that give themſelves up to Dancing and Fiddling, and neglect Arms and Hiſtory, the true Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Gentleman: But above all, be not inveigled with an Hypotheſis, the bane of Art.</p>
            <p>In the next place, aſſociate with ſuch practical Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians as make their own Medicines, and aſſiſt in the making of Medicines, and ſee their Practice; for by this means (ſuch being uſually call'd in at the beginning of the Diſeaſe) you may obſerve a whole proceſs of Cure; whereas thoſe that only preſcribe, are ſeldom ſent for till the Diſeaſe is incurable.</p>
            <p>Moreover, add Reading to Practice, and every day let ſome time be allotted for Study; and ſo you will be confirm'd, and in a great meaſure freed from thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious and vexatious Thoughts, that continually afflict Phyſicians when they are not incouraged and ſtrengthen'd by the aſſiſtance of good Authors. Is it not, therefore, most adviſeable to abate ſomething of the gayity of Youth, and to apply, in time, to ſerious Matters, that thereby you may procure a laſting Peace with your Selves, and a comfortable Repoſe for Age? For tho' many pleaſant Surprizes daily occur in Youth, that make the World, for a time, a very agreeable Habitation, yet the continual Reflections on the Follies of it, in our fading Years, render the Mind ſour and uneaſy.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I ſhall add one ſhort Note, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all young Phyſicians to obſerve well, <hi>viz.</hi> That you have a regard to the predominant Symptom; for in many Caſes you must for a time deſist from the method of curing the Original Diſeaſe, and immediately bend all your force againſt the urgent Symptom; otherwiſe the Patient will be deſtroy'd before the Diſeaſe can be cur'd.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. Of a Phrenſie.</head>
                  <p>A Phrenſie, in Latin, <hi>Phrenitis,</hi> is twofold, True and Spurious. A true Phrenſie is an inflamation of the Brain and Membranes of it, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Delirium, and a continual Acute Feaver. A Baſtard Phrenſie proceeds from an hot intemperies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Brain from the whole Body; as in Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Feavers, or from the inflamation of ſome particular part, as of the Liver, Lungs, and eſpecially the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragm.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes of a true Phrenſie proceed from Cholerick Blood extravaſated.</p>
                  <p>The Signs of an approaching Phrenſie, are Watchings, diſturbed Sleep, immoderate Speech, Urine firſt Thick, then Thin and Clear; Heat and Pain in the Head, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65404:8"/>A Phrenſie is known by perpetual Raving, reſtleſs Watching, and by drawing the Breath deep, and ſeldom, and the Sick does not call for Drink; though there are great and apparent cauſes of Thirſt; the Pulſe is ſmall, frequent, and quick; the Feaver is continual, and the Tongue black, yellow or rough.</p>
                  <p>A Phrenſie is generally deadly, becauſe the Noble Parts are generally affected: But there is moſt hopes of Recovery when they Laugh, and when all the ſymptoms are mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and when the Strength is good; and if after the Diſeaſe is at height, ſome evacuation happens, as by Sweat, Bleeding at the Noſe, or a Looſneſs: The following Signs ſhew it to be deadly, trembling of the Hands and Tongue, gnaſhing of the Teeth, Convulſion, and a ſhaking at the beginning of it, catching of the Cloaths, black Blood drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Noſe, white Stools, and a pale Urine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE.</hi> The Blood flowing to the Head muſt be evacuated, repelled, intercepted, and a revulſion of it muſt be made. That which is already flown in muſt be evacuated and diſcuſſed; the intemperies of the part muſt be corrected, and the ſtrength of it, and of the whole Body muſt be preſerved. All theſe things may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the following remedies: But firſt of all, and at any time of the day, Bleeding muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>If it be occaſion'd by a ſuppreſſion of the Lochia, or of the Courſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of the Hemorrhoids, the Vein call'd Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phena muſt be open'd in the Foot; afterwards you muſt open a Vein in the Arm, to evacuate the Blood that is put off upon the Head, Bleeding is to be repeated twice, thrice, or more, according to the height of the Diſeaſe, and the Age, and Strength of the Patient.</p>
                  <p>Note in opening of the Vein, the Orifice muſt be ſmall; for otherwiſe the reſtleſneſs of the Sick will force the Blood out, and ſo make it joyn the ſooner; you may apply a Plaiſter to it made of Aloes, the White of an Egg, and Hares Down.</p>
                  <p>After Bleeding you muſt endeavour to procure Sleep, by applying cooling things to the Forehead and Temples, and Anodine Medicines muſt be given inwardly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Lettice and Purſlain Water each one Ounce, of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codium half an Ounce, or ſix Drams, of Syrup of Lemons half an Ounce, make a Draught to be taken at Bed-time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65404:8"/>The Sick may take often of the following Julep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Lettice, Purſlain, Roſes, red Poppies each three Ounces, Syrup of Violets and Pomgranats each one Ounce and an half, of Sal prunella three Drams, make a Julep. The Doſe is three or four ſpoonfuls at a time, four or five times a day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Bleeding cannot be uſed, Cupping-glaſſes muſt be applied, with deep Scarification, firſt to the lower Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Thighs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then to the upper Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Shoulders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And afterwards you may apply them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scarification to the Legs and other parts: Bliſters may be alſo conveniently applied to the Shoulders and Arms, and a cooling Glyſter muſt be daily injected. For inſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the common decoction for Glyſters one Pint; diſſolve in it one Ounce of Lenitive Electuary, and four Ounces of Brown Sugar; make a Glyſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note, That the quantity of the Glyſter muſt be varied, according to the Age and Bigneſs of the Patient.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding in the Noſe, by pricking often with a Lancet, the Noſtrils where the Hairs grow, does much good; and alſo Leeches applied behind the Ears, to the Noſtrils and Forehead.</p>

                  <p>GIddineſs, in Latin, <hi>Vertigo.</hi> There are two ſorts of it; in one the Sight is taken away; in the other it is not. The Cauſe of Giddineſs is a circumvolution of the Spirits. An idiopathick Giddineſs is known by Pains, and dulneſs in the Head, a dulneſs of the Sight, noiſe in the Ears, Deafneſs, and the like. The peccant Matter is diſcovered by the following Signs; dulneſs of the outward and inward Senſes, Sloth, much Sleep, much Spitting, want of Appetite, and of Thirſt; a white and crude Urine ſhew that Flegm abounds; watching, anger, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Body, thirſt, a quick Pulſe, thin and yellow Urine, ſignifie that Choler is peccant; fear, ſadneſs, diſturbed thoughts, long watching, dreadful Dreams, ſoure belchings, and the like, ſignifie Melancholy abounds: The bigneſs and ſtiffneſs of the Veins, a florid Countenance, and heat of the Face, beating of the Temples, dulneſs of the Head, wearineſs, or a red and thick Urine, and ſometimes a thin, when there is a tranſlation to the Head, ſignifie that Blood abounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65404:9"/>A ſympathetick Giddineſs is known by the abſence of the Symptoms that proceed from the Head, and when there is no apparent Diſeaſe in the Brain.</p>
                  <p>Want of Appetite, nauciouſneſs, ſoure Belching, Pain, or Wind in the Stomach, ſignifie that it proceeds from the Stomach; that a Giddineſs proceeds from the Liver, Spleen, or Womb, is known by the following Signs: When it proceeds from the Spleen there are frequent and large eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations of Wind, inflation of the Belly, ſoure Belchings, and the like; when from the Womb, there is ſtopage of the Courſes, or Hyſterick Fits.</p>
                  <p>A Giddineſs that is recent, and ſeldom invades, and that which is occaſioned by external Cauſes is light, and eaſily Cured; that which is inveterate and frequent, moſt commonly ends in the Falling Sickneſs, or Apoplexy.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>THE Falling Sickneſs, in Latin, <hi>Epilepſia,</hi> is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and violent Convulſion; the Fit moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly comes of a ſudden, and precipitates in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Eye to the Earth, and deprives a Man of Senſe and Underſtanding; for they ſeem rather forcibly thrown down, than to fall; and that part which firſt comes to the Ground, is moſt commonly bruiſed or wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They gnaſh with their Teeth, foam at the Mouth, and often beat their Heads againſt the Ground; their Arms and Legs either become rigid, or toſſed here or there. Some beat their Breaſts violently, and ſome caſt their Bodies impetuouſly hither and thither: But in moſt the Belly ſwells much. After ſome time, ſometimes ſooner, ſometimes longer, the ſymptoms ſuddenly ceaſe, as if the Tragedy were juſt ended, and then the Sick come to themſelves again, and are ſenſible; but there remains after the Fit is gone off a pain in the Head, and a dulneſs in their Senſes, and often a Giddineſs.</p>
                  <p>The Fits are ſometimes wont to come at ſet times of the day, month, or year; but moſt commonly according to the greater turns of the year, or according to the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or oppoſite Aſpects of the Moon, or Sun, they return more certainly, and afflict more violently; and ſometimes the Fits are uncertain, and come as occaſion is offered, and according to the variety of evident Cauſes. Sometimes they are gentle, ſometimes violent; ſometimes, though rarely, ſome Signs forewarn the Epileptick perſon of a

Fit before he falls, as a dulneſs of the Head; ſparkling of Fire before the Eyes, Noiſe in the Ears, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes a Convulſion in ſome outward part, as in the Arm, or in the Leg, or in the Back, or in the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondres, precedes, which riſing from thence like a cold Air towards the Head, occaſions the Fit.</p>

                  <p>CHildrens Convulſions, in Latin, <hi>Epilepſia puerorum,</hi> are ſo frequent, that it is almoſt the only Species of Convulſions.</p>
                  <p>They are chiefly ſubject to them in the firſt Month, and at the time they breed Teeth; but they alſo happen at other times, and proceed from other cauſes in ſuch are diſpoſed to them: Sometimes they do not come preſently after the Birth, but lye hid until the breeding of Teeth, or not till a great while after, and take their riſe from other evident Cauſes either Internal or External; as from an Unhealthy or Big-bellied Nurſe, from Milk co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated or corrupted in the Stomach, from a Feaveriſh Diſpoſition, from Ulcers or Scabs of the Head, or of other Parts ſuddenly diſappearing; from changes of the Air, or from the Conjunction or oppoſite Aſpects of the Sun and Moon.</p>
                  <p>We muſt endeavour to prevent theſe Convulſions in Children and Infants, or to Cure them when they are come; for if the former Children of the ſame Parents have been ſubject to Convulſive Fits, this Diſeaſe ought to be prevented, by the early uſe of Remedies, in ſuch as are born after: To this end it is cuſtomary to give to new-born Babes, as ſoon as they begin to breath, ſome Medicine proper for Convulſions: Some, upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, give ſome drops of pure Hony; others a Spoonful of Canary-wine ſweetned with Sugar, or Oyl of Almonds freſh drawn; others give a drop of Oyl of Ambar, or half a Spoonful of Epileptick water. Beſides theſe things uſed at firſt, which certainly do good, ſome other Remedies ought to be adminiſtred; for inſtance, give a Spoonful twice a day of the following Liquor:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Black Cherries and Rue, each one Ounce and a half; of </hi> Langius's <hi>Antiepilectick Water, one Ounce; of Syrup of Coral, ſix Drams; of prepared Pearl, fifteen Grains; mingle them in a Viol.</hi>

                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:65404:12"/>The third or fourth day after the Birth, make an Iſſue in the Neck, and if the Countenance be florid, evacuate by bleeding, an Ounce and an half or two Ounces of Blood from the Jugular Veins, but take care that too much Blood do not flow out in ſleep; rub gently the Temples with the following Linement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oyl of Nutmegs by expreſſion two Drams, of Balſam of Copaiba three Drams, of Ambar one Scruple, mix them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hang round the Neck the Roots and Seeds of Male-peony, and a little Elks hoof ſewed up in a Rag: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Medicines proper for Convulſions muſt be given daily to the Nurſe.</p>
                  <p>Let her take Morning and Evening a Draught of Whey, wherein the Roots of Male-peony, or the Seeds of Sweet Fennel have been boiled.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Conſerves of the flowers of Bettony, Male-peony, and Roſemary flowers, each two Ounces; of the Powders of the Roots and Flowers of Male-peony, each two Drams; of red Coral prepared, and white Ambar, each one Dram; of the Roots of Angelica and Zodoary prepared, each half a Dram; with a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Peony, make an Electuary. Let her take the quantity of a Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meg Morning and Evening, and be very orderly in her Diet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if any Infant be actually ſeized with Convulſions, becauſe the Iſſue does not run well, you muſt apply a Bliſter to the Neck or behind the Ears; and if the Infant be not of a cold Conſtitution, Blood muſt be drawn from the Jugular Veins by Leeches, and Linements muſt be uſed to the Temples, Noſtrils and Neck, and to the Soles of the Feet; and Gliſters which empty the Belly plentifully muſt be injected: Moreover, often in a day, namely every ſixth or eighth hour, Specifick Remedies muſt be given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oyl of Copaiba, and of Caſtor, each two Drams; of Ambar half a Dram; make a Linement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Apply to the Soles of the Feet the Plaiſter, with <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorbium</hi> ſpread on Leather.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Powder of the Seeds of Rue, of Caſtor, of Aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faetida, each a ſufficient quantity, mingle them and tye it up in a Rag, ſprinkle it with Vinegar, and put it often to the Noſtrils.</hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntzerus</hi> commends much the Gall of a Sucking Kitlin, all the Juice being taken out of the Bladder, and mixed with a little water of Lime-flowers, and given to the Child: An excellent Phyſician lately told me, that he had known ſeveral Children cured with this Remedy. When by reaſon of breeding Teeth difficultly, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions happen, this Symptom is Secondary and leſs Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and therefore does not require the firſt and chief work of Healing; for ſometimes we are more Solicitous to eaſe the Pain, and take off the Feaveriſh Diſpoſition. And therefore a thin and cooling Diet is ordered for the Eruption of the Teeth, either by rubbing or cutting the Gums, and things that are anodine are applied to the ſwelled and pained Parts; and here Gliſters and Bleeding are often uſed; and we ought to procure Sleep, and to qualifie the Fury of the Blood; in the mean while Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Medicines for Convulſions, and ſuch as do the leaſt ſtir the Humours, are to be uſed, and Bliſters, becauſe they evacuate the Serum too apt to be poured upon the Head, do often give relief.</p>
                  <p>When Children are ſeized with Convulſions, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Birth, or upon breeding Teeth, but from other Occaſions and Accidents; the cauſe, for the moſt part of ſuch, is either in the Head or in the Bowels; when the former is ſuſpected, as is wont to be known by the ſigns which ſhew watry Humours heap'd up in the Brain, the Medicines above mentioned muſt be uſed: Moreover, for thoſe who bear Purging well, a Vomit or gentle Purge muſt be preſcribed, Wine and Oxymel of Squills, alſo <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> Rubarb, and Roſin of Jalap are of good uſe, when the cauſe of the Convulſions ſeems to be lodged in the Bowels, or when Worms or ſharp Humours in the Belly are the cauſe: For Worms, a Purge of Rubarb, or of <hi>Mercurius dulcis,</hi> with the Roſin
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65404:13"/>
of Jalap muſt be given, and the following Medicines are alſo of uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Virginian Snake-weed powdered one Dram, of Coral calcined till it is white half a Dram; make a Powder. The Doſe is half a Scruple or a Scruple twice a day for three days following, drinking upon it the Decoction of the Roots of Graſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Hiera pitra, and of Venice-Treacle, each one Dram; make a Plaiſter for the Belly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Convulſions are thought to proceed from ſharp Humours diſturbing the Bowels or Stomach, Purging up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and downward by turns is to be obſerved; to this end a gentle Vomit of <hi>Wine of Squills, or Salt of Vitriol,</hi> is to be given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Syrup of Peony three Ounces, Salt of Vitriol two Scruples, of Compound Lavender-water one Dram, mingle them, give a Spoonful three or four times in an hour, till the Child has once Vomited or went to Stool once.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if Evacuation downward ſeem moſt proper, give the Infuſion of Rubarb, or the Powder of it, or Syrup of Succory with Rubarb, or Syrup of Roſes with Agarick: And moreover Gliſters are to be uſed frequently in this caſe, and External Medicines are to be applied to the Belly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the leaves of Camomil cut ſmall, two handfuls, put them into two Bags made of fine Cloth or of Silk, which being dip'd in hot Milk and preſſed out, are to be applied ſucceſſively to the Belly.</hi>

                  <p>The firſt and principal cauſe of theſe Diſeaſes, is a Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick or Watry Humour, contained in the Brain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Nature.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sleepy Diſeaſes are wont to be generated by Blood abounding in the Brain, and from extravaſated Blood ſtopping or oppreſſing the Ventricles of the Brain, ſleepy Diſeaſe, and eſpecially an Apoplexy is ſometimes occaſioned.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is certain that a Comatoſe Diſeaſe proceeds from a Tumor that oppreſſes the Brain by its weight.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Immoderate Vapors carried to the Head, may be the cauſe of a Sympathetick Coma.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, From the immoderate uſe of Narcotick Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines inwardly taken, ſo deep a Sleep is occaſioned, that many, by the imprudent uſe of Opium, have ſlept their laſt.</p>
                  <p>That Sleepy Diſeaſes are occaſioned by Flegmatick Humours ſtagnating in the Brain, is known by a Flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Habit of Body, by old Age or Childhood, by a cold or moiſt Seaſon or Country, by the Suppreſſion of the Excretion of Flegm, by the Mouth and Noſtrils; and for that the Sick, before the coming of this Diſeaſe, was afflicted with a Dulneſs of the Head, Dimneſs of Sight, and Unaptneſs for Motion; and becauſe in the Diſeaſe Flegm flows from the Mouth and Noſtrils, or falling upon the Throat, is frequently ſwallowed down by the Sick.</p>
                  <p>That Blood produces a ſleepy Diſeaſe is known by a Plethorick Diſpoſition, by Redneſs of the Face, and by a Pain in the Head foregoing this Diſeaſe: That the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetick
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65404:14"/>
Diſeaſe ariſes from Vapors elevated to the Brain, is known by the abſence of thoſe Signs, which ſignifie an Idiopathetick Diſeaſe, alſo by the ſigns of the peculiar diſorder of the Parts, from whence Vapors are tranſmitted to the Brain.</p>
                  <p>A very thin Diet is to be ordered at the beginning of theſe Diſeaſes, and when the Fit is off, the Sick, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Relapſe, muſt forbear all ſtrong Liquors, and be fed with Barly and Oat-meal Broths, or with Chicken Broth; and ſometimes, eſpecially when he Purges, with Chickens, Lamb, and the like.</p>
                  <p>When a Phyſician is firſt called to a Patient, that is ſeized with a ſleepy Diſeaſe, he muſt endeavour by all means to rowſe him, by offering Violence to all his Senſes; and therefore he muſt expoſe his Eyes to the Sun-beams, or to a clear Light; his Ears muſt be filled with violent Noiſes and Clamours, and the Sick muſt be ſure to be called aloud by his own name; ſharp things are to be blown up his Noſtrils; the Senſe of Touching is to be revived by Frictions, Vellications, plucking of the Hair, Ligatures, Squeeſing of the Fingers together, and the like; he muſt be preſently Blooded if he has Strength; but his Strength is not to be judged of by the preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but by ſuch as he was in before the Diſeaſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded him. You muſt firſt Bleed in the Arm, and then in the Jugular Vein, preſently after give the following Vomit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Bleſſed Wine one Ounce and an half, of Carduus water one Ounce, of Spirit of Juniper-berries two drops; make a Vomit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Inject two or three ſharp Gliſters in a day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Carminative Decoction, with Bay-berries and Juniper-berries ten Ounces, of the Electuary of Bay-berries one Ounce, of Vinum Benedictum three Ounces, and of brown Sugar three Ounces, of Chymical Oyl of Juniper ten drops; mingle them, make a Gliſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Gliſter be not rendred in due time, provoke the Belly by a Suppoſitory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Hiera picra half an Ounce, of Sal Gemma one Dram, of Hony a ſufficient quantity; make Suppoſitories.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spirit of Sal Armoniack muſt be held to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, and things of all kinds that cauſe Revulſion muſt be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65404:15"/>
uſed, not only Frictions and Ligatures, but alſo Cupping-glaſſes ſet on the Back, Shoulders, Arms and Thighs: But in an Apoplexy you muſt not apply Cupping-glaſſes to the Back, or to the Hypochonders, leaſt the Muſcles of the Breaſt and Belly ſhould be contracted, and ſo Reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more hindred: Cupping-glaſſes applied to the Head are counted very proper; apply a Bliſtering Plaiſter with Euphorbium to the Neck: Some, according to the Cuſtom of the Ancients, hold a red-hot Frying-pan to the Head, at ſuch a diſtance as it may burn the Hair but not the Skin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Rue, Balm and Black-Cherries, each three Ounces; of Compound Peony water, and of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Syrup of Peony, each one Ounce and a half; of Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Caſtor one Dram, of Spirit of Sal Armoniack half a Dram; mingle them, make a Julep, give four or five Spoonfuls often.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the general Cure of theſe Diſeaſes you muſt take notice, that in thoſe which proceed from Blood, Medicines that heat the leaſt are to be uſed; but Bleeding is to be uſed more freely, and afterwards the Vein in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is to be opened, and things that purge Choler are to be mixed with thoſe that purge Flegm: If the Brain be very much cooled, the Sick, after univerſal Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may uſe Tablets made in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Amber-greaſe half a Scruple, diſtilled Oyl of the Seeds of Aniſe, Cinnamon and Nutmegs, of each three drops; Oyl of Cloves one drop; of Sugar diſſolved in Orange-flower water, four Ounces; make Tablets, let him take a dram or two drams every Morning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following Powder is alſo commended and is much in uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of white Ambar half an Ounce; of the Powder called Diarhodon Abbatis two drams; of the Roots of Peony one dram and an half; make a Powder, whereof give a dram in two Spoonfuls of Simple Peony water before the New Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is alſo proper to hold Nutmeg often in the Mouth, and to chew it; and Perfumes are to be held often to the Noſtrils, eſpecially Apoplectick Balſam; Spices are to be uſed with Meats, and the following Digeſtive Powder after Meals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65404:15"/>
                     <hi>Take of the Seeds of Coriander, ſweet Fennel, Caraways, each fifteen Grains, of white Ambar one Dram, of the yellow peel of Citrons, and flowers of Roſemary each one Dram and an half, of Nutmegs half a Dram, of white Sugar three Ounces; powder them groſly, and give half a ſpoonful after Meals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If from too great a quantity of Blood a ſleepy Diſeaſe is feared, the Patient muſt be ſufficiently Blooded, and the utmoſt endeavours muſt be uſed to make the Hemorrhoids flow, than which nothing can be more advantageous.</p>
                  <p>Purging is to be ordered to prevent a Relapſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pill of Ambar, and of the leſſer Cochie, each two Scruples, of the beſt Caſtor ſix Grains, of Oyl of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar a ſufficient quantity; mix them and make 12 Pills. Take ſix for a Doſe, and the other ſix three days after.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pill of Ambar one Scruple, of Roſin of Jalap ſix Grains, of Tartar vitriolated eight Grains, ſpirit of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender eight drops, of</hi> Elixir Proprietatis <hi> a ſufficient quantity; make 4 or 5 Pills to be taken in the Morning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Purging preſcribe the following Medicines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Conſerves of the Flowers of Male peony, and of Roſemary each one Ounce, of the Bark of Citron Candied ſix Drams, of the Species Diambra, and Dianthos, each one Dram, of Caſtor powdred two Scruples, of Compound Spirit of Lavender half a Dram, with a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Syrups of Gilliflowers, and Compound Peony; Make an Electuary, give the quantity of a Nutmeg Morning and Evening daily; and let the Sick take four ſpoonfuls of the following Julep after it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Black Cherries, Rue, Pennyroyal each three Ounces, of Compound Peony Water, and</hi> Langius's <hi>Epileptick Water, each one Ounce, of the Syrup of the Flowers of Male Peony one Ounce, mingle them.</hi> Or,</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Catalepſis,</hi> or <hi>Catoche.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis Diſeaſe is very rare and very wonderful. <hi>Galen</hi> mentions an Obſervation of one of his Scholars, who upon hard Study was ſeized with a Catalepſis. He lay, ſays he, like a piece of Wood, extended, rigid, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible; his Eyes were always kept open, but he could not ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>When he recovered, he told us he could hear us ſpeak, though not plainly; he remembred what was done, and ſaw all that were with him; but he ſaid he could not ſpeak nor move a Limb: And <hi>Fernelius</hi> mentions two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of this kind: He ſays, that a perſon ſtudying very hard was ſeized with this Diſeaſe, and that he was ſo ſtiff, that ſitting with his Pen in his Hand, and looking earneſtly upon his Book, he was ſuppoſed to be hard at Study; till being called, and pull'd, he was perceived to have no Senſe nor Motion. Another lay as it were Dead, who neither ſaw nor heard, nor felt when he was pricked. He breathed well; and whatever was put in his Mouth he readily ſwallowed: Being taken out of his Bed he ſtood alone; and being puſh'd he went forward; and in what manner ſoever his Hand, or Arm, or Leg was Bent, it ſtood fix'd; ſo that he look'd like a Statue.</p>
                  <p>The like Obſervations are to be found in many other Authors; from whence you may gather, that there is moſt commonly an abolition of the internal and external Senſes, and a ſtiffneſs of the Limbs: But ſometimes the Senſes are not wholly aboliſhed; for ſometimes they can hear, and their Limbs may be moved by the By-ſtanders,</p>
                  <p>The Cure is twofold, one in the Fit, the other out of the Fit: In the Fit, thoſe things are proper which are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65404:16"/>
preſcribed for Sleepy Diſeaſes. Out of the Fit, ſuch things as are uſed for Cure of Melancholy are proper; for from thence it moſt commonly proceeds: But if it come from a Cold intemperies, ſuch things are proper as ſerve to mend ſuch a Conſtitution; if it proceed from abundance of Blood, Bleeding is to be uſed.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. Of a Palſie.</head>
                  <p>A Palſie, in Latin, <hi>Paralyſis,</hi> is a privation of Senſe and Motion, by reaſon the influx of the Animal Spirits is hindred. There are various differences of it; for either it ſeizes all the parts of the Head, then it is called <hi>Paraple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>; or only half the Body, then it is called <hi>Hemeplegia</hi>; or it ſeiſes only one part, then it is called a particular Palſie. It is alſo called perfect, and imperfect: It is ſaid to be perfect when Senſe and Motion are wholly aboliſhed; imperfect when the Functions are weakned: And then it is alſo called Numbneſs, which is a fore-runner of a Palſie. There is alſo another Species of an imperfect Palſie, when Motion is hurt, and the Senſe remains perfect; and ſo on the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes of a Palſie in general, are all thoſe things which hinder the influx of the Animal Spirits into the Nerves and Muſcles; the moſt frequent of all is a Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Humour; which by obſtructing, compreſſing, thickning or cooling the Nerves, hinders the ſaid influx of the Animal Spirits.</p>
                  <p>The Pituitous humour flows from the Brain into the Nerves and ſpinal Marrow; ſo a ſmall Apoplexy degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into a Palſie; becauſe the humour occaſioning it is caſt from the Brain upon the Marrow, or beginning of the Nerves; and ſo it either inſinuates it ſelf into the ſubſtance of them, and ſhuts the inſenſible paſſages through which the Spirits paſs; or paſſing by the Vertebra's of the Back, and ſpinal Marrow, and following the Courſe of the Nerves compreſſes them, and ſo hinders the paſſages of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65404:17"/>
the Animal Spirits; and the ſame Humour may thicken the ſubſtance of the Nerves by its Coldneſs; ſo that it cannot make way for the Animal Spirits.</p>
                  <p>There are other Cauſes of a Palſie, but they are not ſo common; as taking Cold, a Blow or Fall, the frequent handling of Quickſilver, tumors near the Spine or Nerves; cutting of the Nerves, diſlocation of the Vertebra, or other Joints. The kind of the Diſeaſe is eaſily known; for want of Motion and Senſe may be ſoon perceived; but the knowledge of the part affected is more difficult: But it may be known by thoſe that are skilled in Anatomy, who know the Originations and Inſertions of the Nerves. For if the right part of the Face becomes Paralytick, or the left, the other parts being ſound, they know the Brain is only affected according to that part from whence the Nerves are carried to thoſe parts: But if the parts under the Head are alſo afflicted with the Face, the Brain and the Spine of the Back are alſo affected; and if the parts below the Head are ſeiſed, and the Face well, the fault is only in the Spine; and in the beginning of it, if all the Parts are affected: But if only half the Body is Paralytick, only half the Spine is affected. When the Legs are Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick, the ſeat of the Diſeaſe is about the end of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Marrow, near the Vertebra's of the <hi>Os Sacrum;</hi> and ſo in the reſt, the place is to be ſought for from whence the Nerves ariſe. And ſometimes enquiry after the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Cauſe much helps to find out the Part affected; of which there are two Inſtances in <hi>Galen,</hi> one of a certain Man, who in a Cold and Rainy Seaſon wore a long while a wet Neckcloath about his Neck, his Hands became Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralytick. The other is of one who loſt the Senſe of three of his Fingers; and when <hi>Galen</hi> underſtood that he fell out of a Cart upon his Back, he conjectured that ſome Part was hurt by the Fall under the ſeventh Vertebra, where the Nerve begins; and therefore he applied the Medicine which was uſed before to the Fingers, to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to that part.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of the Cauſes is to be fetched from the Procatarctick Cauſes, the foregoing Diſeaſes, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Sick; and ſo the external cooling and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening Cauſes going before, Old Age, a Flegmatick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, Winter, cold and moiſt Diet: An Apoplexy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65404:17"/>
going before, ſignifie that the Diſeaſe proceeds from a cold intemperies, and a Flegmatick humour.</p>
                  <p>Feavers foregoing, and ſometimes a preſent Feaver, Cholerick, or Melancholy Conſtitution, Summer-time, or Autumn, the uſe of Spices, of Salt or hot Meats, violent and long Paſſions of the Mind, the excretion of Cholerick and Melancholy humours, or of Acid, or Acrid Serum, hot defluxions upon various parts, and Pains ariſing from thence: And laſtly, when Pain and Convulſions accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the diminution of Senſe and Motion; and when ſuch as are ſo afflicted are injured by hot and drying Medicines, and relieved by cooling and moiſtening Remedies, the Palſie proceeds from Cholerick or Melancholy humours. Tumors, and luxations; and Wounds cauſing a Palſie are eaſily known.</p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>The Prognoſtick Signs.</head>
                     <p>A Palſie coming from a pituitous humour ſtuffing the ſubſtance of the Nerves, is difficult to Cure. A Palſie following an Apoplexy is ſeldom Cured, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly turns to an Apoplexy again. A trembling coming upon a Palſie is good: If the paralytick Part be hot there is hope of Recovery; but if it be always cold it is hardly Cured. A waſting of the Part, and great Paleneſs renders it incurable. If the Eye of the Paralytick ſide be leſſened, there is little hopes of a Cure. A Palſie of the Legs or Feet is eaſier Cured, than of the upper Parts. A Palſie in old People is incurable. A Palſie cannot be Cured in the Winter. A violent Feaver coming upon a Palſie is good, ſo is a Looſneſs coming upon a ſmall, and new Palſie.</p>
                     <p>The Cure of a Palſie is to be varied according to the variety of the Cauſes; but becauſe it chiefly comes from Flegm, and a cold intemperies, we muſt chiefly endeavour to remove this Cauſe, and you muſt begin with an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal evacuation of the whole Body: As to Bleeding that can ſcarce do any good, for the Blood is not in the fault, but Flegm; and for the moſt part this Diſeaſe ſeiſes Old People, ſuch as are Flegmatick, and naturally Cold: But if an abundance of crude Blood ſhould ſeem to produce the Flegmatick Humour, and to nouriſh it, a Vein may be opened in the Arm of the well-ſide: But Blood muſt be drawn ſparingly, leſt the languid Heat ſhould be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:65404:18"/>Therefore Bleeding being omitted, or uſed as is ſaid, ſparingly, the Cure muſt be begun by removing the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Cauſe, which is a cold intemperies of the Brain. To which end the following Remedies muſt be uſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Roots of Cyperus, Florentine Orris, Angelica, Zedoary, Elecompane, each one Ounce, of the Leaves of Bettony, Marjoram, Balm, Peniroyal, Calaminth, each one handful; of the Tops of Thym, and Sage, each half an handful, of the Seeds of Aniſe, Seſely, and Fennel, each three Drams; of Liquoriſh raſped, of Raiſins of the Sun cleanſed, each one Ounce; of the Leaves of Senna cleanſed, and ſprinkled with </hi> Aqua Vitae <hi>two Ounces; of the Seeds of </hi> Carthamus <hi>bruiſed, and of freſh Polypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Oak, each one Ounce; of Agarick newly tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſcated; of Turbith, and Hermodactil's, each three Drams; of Ginger and Cloves, each one Dram; of the Flowers of</hi> Staechas, <hi>of Roſemary, Sage and Lavender, each one pugil; boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Water to a Pint; diſſolve in it four Ounces of White Sugar, clarifie it, and aromatize it with two Drams of Cinnamon, and make an Apozem for four Doſes, to be taken in a Morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the firſt and laſt Doſe diſſolve three Drams of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaenicon. Or,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Maſs of Pill </hi> Cochiae Minor <hi>two Scruples, moiſten them with Bettony Water; make five or ſix Pills, guild them, and let him take them early in the Morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Pills of <hi>Agarick,</hi> and of <hi>Cochiae major</hi> are uſed for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of Gujacum, and of Sarſaparilla, each two Ounces; infuſe them twenty four hours in two Quarts of Fountain Water over hot Aſhes, then boil them over a gentle fire to the conſumption of half, ſtrain it, give half a Pint hot in the Morning, and cover the Sick well that they may Sweat. The uſe of this may be continued for fifteen or twenty days, or longer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the uſe of Sudorifick Decoctions, this is always to be obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> let ſome Purging Medicine be given once a Week, omitting for that day the Sudorifick Potion. Sneezing, Apoplegmatiſms, Bliſters, Head Powders, and Baths are alſo uſed. After the uſe of the Diet Drink, give the following Pills once a Week.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65404:18"/>
                        <hi>Take of the faetid Pill, Coch. Minor, each half a Dram: Troches of Alhandal four Grains; mingle them, and make Pills to be taken in the Morning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But becauſe the Humour wants preparation before every Purge, therefore two or three days before every Doſe of the Pills, give three or four Ounces of the following Water, in the Morning two hours before Eating.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of Gujacum four Ounces, of the Bark of the ſame one Ounce, of Sarſaparilla one Ounce and an half, of China one Ounce, of Saſſafras ſix Drams, of Wood of Aloes, and of Galingal each one Dram and an half, of the Roots of Angelica, Peony, and Fennel, each three Drams and an half, of the Seeds of Peony two Drams, infuſe them twenty four hours in ſix Pints of Fountain Water, and two Quarts of White Wine. Afterwards add the Leaves of Bettony, ground Pine, Sage, each one handful; of the Flowers of the Lime-tree, Primroſe, Staechas, and Roſemary, each two Pugils; of Lavender Flowers one Pugil, of Old Venice Treacle half an Ounce, of the Seeds and Bark of Citron each two Drams and an half, of Polypody half an Ounce, of Cinnamon ſix Drams; diſtil them in a Bath, to two Pints and an half of the Liquor, add four Ounces of Penids.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Purges abovementioned are not ſucceſsful, it will be convenient to give Chymical Vomits, as <hi>Vinum Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictum,</hi> and the like, if the Sick is able to bear them.</p>
                     <p>After general Evacuation, we muſt uſe Topicks, both to the Paralytick part to recall the Heat and Spirits, and to the Spinal Marrow; where for the moſt part reſides the Cauſe of the Diſeaſe; therefore let the part affected be rubbed daily gently with hot Cloaths, and let Cupping Glaſſes be applied to the Heads of the Muſcles of the part affected, let them have a narrow Mouth, and much Flame: But they muſt not be kept on long, leſt what is attracted ſhould be diſſipated. Afterwards apply a Plaiſter of Pitch and Roſin of the Pine; that what is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted may be kept in. All the Paralytick part may be Stung gently with Nettles. Afterwards the part affected may be anointed with proper Oils, Ointments, and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſams. The following Ointment is very good in this caſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65404:19"/>
                        <hi>Take of the Juice of Squills four Ounces, of the Juice of Wild Cucumber, and of the Juice of Rue each one Ounce, of Euphorbium, Caſtor, Sagapenum, Ammonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, Bdellium, diſſolved all in Vinegar, each one Dram and an half; of Myrrh, Frankincenſe, Pellitory of Spain, Niter, each one Dram; of Oils of Elder, Turpentine, and of Euphorbium, each half an Ounce, of Wax a ſufficient quantity to make an Ointment. After the anointing the part, wrap it about with hot Cloaths.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Diſeaſe goes not off by theſe means, Plaiſters are to be applied to the Spine of the Back; the following is of excellent uſe for this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of Ship-pitch, Galbanum, Sagapenum, and Gum Ammoniack, each one Ounce, of the Roots of Pellitory of Spain, and of Muſtard Seed each half an Ounce, of Euphorbium two Drams, of Yellow Wax three Drams, of Oyl of Turpentine a ſufficient quantity; make a Plaiſter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is alſo very good to Sweat the Part affected by the Vapours from a Decoction of Cephalick Herbs and Roots made in White Wine; but the Decoction muſt not touch the Part. A Decoction of the Roots of Burdock is alſo much commended in this Caſe: Theſe ſorts of Baths are to be uſed twice or thrice a Week; and after Bathing you muſt put the Sick to Bed, and give him a Dram of Venice Treacle. The green Leaves of Tobacco infuſed in Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Wine, and the Parts bathed with it after Sweating, is reckoned the beſt outward Remedy for a Palſie.</p>
                     <p>But laſtly, the Bath Waters are beſt; if the Sick drink of them ſome days, Bath and Waſh the Head with them, and afterwards rub the Parts with the Infuſion of Tobacco Leaves.</p>
                     <p>The Paralytick Parts muſt be always kept warm: If it can be, with the Skins of Foxes, Hares, or Lambs.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. Of a Convulſion.</head>
                  <p>A Convulſion, in Latin, <hi>Spaſmus,</hi> is an involuntary and perpetual Retraction of the Nerves and Muſcles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Original.</p>
                  <p>It is twofold, one properly ſo called, to which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition above mentioned agrees; the other is rather a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Motion; and they are thus diſtinguiſhed: In a true Convulſion, the retraction of the Muſcle is continual, and the Member immoveable: In a Convulſive Motion, the Member is variouſly agitated, as in the Falling-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>They alſo differ in their Cauſes; for a true Convulſion proceeds from fulneſs or emptineſs, a Convulſive Motion from Irritation.</p>
                  <p>A true Convulſion is divided into univerſal and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; an univerſal takes its riſe either from the Brain, and then the Muſcles of the Face are alſo ſeiſed with Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or it ariſes from the beginning of the Spinal Marrow, then the Muſcles of the Head, or thoſe that move the Spine forward or backward are ſeiſed with Convulſions: Upon which account there are three ſorts of Convulſions; the firſt is called <hi>Emproſthotonos,</hi> wherein the Body with the Head and Neck are violently contracted forward, ſo that the Chin touches the Breaſt, and the Body repreſents the Keel of a Ship, and ſometimes is bent like a Bow, and the Head touches the Knees: In this ſort, two Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that bend the Head forward are chiefly affected.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is called <hi>Opiſthotonos</hi>; and in it the Body is bent backward: The twelve Muſcles that extend the Head, or ſome of them, being Convulſed.</p>
                  <p>The third is called <hi>Tetanos,</hi> wherein the Muſcles before and behind are equally contracted, and the Parts kept as it were in <hi>Aequilibrio.</hi> This is the ſtrongeſt of all; it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from a Contraction of all the Muſcles.</p>
                  <p>A particular Convulſion is cauſed by the Contraction of ſome one part, the Nerve that ſerves for its Motion being ill affected, which has ſometimes a peculiar Name from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65404:20"/>
the effect or ſymptom; as a Convulſion of the Muſcles moving the Eyes is called <hi>Strabiſmus,</hi> that of the Jaws and Muſcles of the Temples <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. A Convulſion of the Mouth, from a Contraction of the broad Muſcle ariſing only from one part, is called the Dog Convulſion: But if there be a Contraction in both ſides, it is call'd <hi>Riſus Sardonicus</hi>; but ſometimes the Mouth is diſtorted by the Palſie, by Relaxation of the other Muſcle. A Convulſion of the Yard is call'd <hi>Satyriaſis,</hi> or <hi>Priapiſmus.</hi> Other Convulſions have no proper Names.</p>
                  <p>The immediate Cauſes of a true Convulſion, according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> are repletion and inanition, the mediate Cauſes which occaſion a repletion, and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition are various; a Flegmatick humour flowing into the Nerves is ſuppoſed to diſtend them, as to their Breadth, and ſo they muſt be neceſſarily contracted as to their length. Another cauſe of Convulſion from repletion, is an inflamation of the Nervous Parts.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes of Convulſions by Emptineſs, are all immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Evacuations by Bleeding, Vomiting, Sweat, and a Conſumption of innate Moiſture, which is occaſioned by Burning and Coliquative Feavers, by immoderate Labour, by Watchings and Cares, and immoderate Venery.</p>
                  <p>A Convulſive Motion proceeds from Matter that Velli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates and Pricks the Nervous Parts, which moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is malignant; for ſuch a humour commonly happens in malignant Feavers: It is alſo occaſioned by Worms, Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and by Hyſterick Fits.</p>
                  <p>A Convulſion which ſeiſes many Parts, eſpecially near the Head, is dangerous; and that which ſeiſes the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Breaſt, is alſo dangerous; for the Sick may be ſuffocated by it.</p>
                  <p>A Convulſion ariſing from great Fluxes of Blood, or over-purging is dangerous, if not deadly; ſo is a Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ariſing from a Phrenſie, and upon a Feaver. <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſays, that thoſe who are ſeiſed with a <hi>Tetanos,</hi> die within four days; but that if they live longer, they recover.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE.</hi> The Cure of this Diſeaſe is to be varied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of the Cauſes. That which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens from Emptineſs is incurable. After Bleeding, or it being omitted, if it be not convenient, ſtrong Purges muſt be uſed: but reſpect muſt be had to the ſtrength of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65404:20"/>
After Bleeding, apply Cupping-glaſſes, with Scari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if Blood has not been drawn before, otherwiſe without Scarification: They muſt be firſt applied to the remoter parts, afterwards to the parts near the affected part: But if the Legs are Convulſed, they muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Buttocks and Loins; if the Arms, to the Neck and Shoulders: Blyſters are alſo applied with good ſucceſs to the parts oppoſite to the part affected. In the mean time, after the firſt Purge, the Matter is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, with Medicines proper for the Head. Note, that Caſtor ought to be added to Purges in this caſe. Sharp Glyſters are frequently to be injected, ſuch as were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Chapter of an Apoplexy. The part affected muſt be anointed with the following, or ſome other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Linement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Oyntment of Marſh-mallows ſix Ounces, Oyl of Turpentine and Camomile each one Ounce, Oyl of Lavender three Drams, of Oyl of Foxes half an Ounce, Liquid Storax two Ounces, wherewith anoint the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part, and the Spine of the Back frequently, with a hot Hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After anointing the parts, wrap them in a warm Sheep-Skin, juſt taken from the Sheep. Sheeps Lungs, Pidgeons or Hens cut in the middle, and applied hot, are alſo good. It is alſo good to put the affected part into the Belly of an Ox, or Sheep newly kill'd, and keep it there as long as it is warm: but the uſe of Sulphurous Baths is moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful.</p>
                  <p>When a violent Pain accompanies the Convulſion, uſe the following Linement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Oyls of Violets, Lillies, Camomile, each one Ounce and an half, of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, Maſtich, and Roſes, each one Ounce; mingle them, and anoint the part affected.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>TRembling, in Latin, <hi>Tremor,</hi> is a depraved Motion of the Members, whereby they are involuntarily moved. The chief Cauſe of it is weakneſs of the Nerves, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by Old Age, by long Sickneſs, by immoderate Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, by Fear, and other paſſions of the Mind; or by ſuch things as are wholly offenſive to the Nerves, as the Fume of Quickſilver.

                  <p>A Catarrh, in Latin, <hi>Catarrhus,</hi> according to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, is a preternatural fluxion of Humours from the Head upon the Lower Parts: But the ingenious Dr. <hi>Lower</hi> is of the Opinion, that it is put off by the Blood upon the Glands that are ſeated in the Throat and Jaws; and he ſays there are no paſſages to convey it from the Head.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore, nothing is better for Curing a Catarrh, if a Feaver does not accompany it, then abſtaining a long while from Drink; for ſeveral have been Cured, by not drinking in three or four days time; for by this means the ſource of the Diſeaſe is dried up; juſt as R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having firſt purged the Body, you muſt preſently Bleed, and the Sick muſt be kept to a thin Diet; and other things are to be done which the Cure of the Feaver requires: but reſpect muſt be had to the Flux of the Serum.</p>
                  <p>But if by reaſon of abundance of Serum, the Catarrh continue obſtinate, in this caſe nothing is better, then after Purging to uſe Diureticks; if the Catarrh yet continue, you muſt make Iſſues in the Neck, Arms, or Legs, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Bliſters there.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe theſe things require time to do the buſineſs, if need require; or if there be danger of Suffocation, you muſt Bleed again, and preſently Sweat the Patient once, or twice a day, if his Strength will bear it; which by caſting forth the ſerous Humour through the Pores of the Body, will perform the Cure.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>HEad-ach, in Latin, <hi>Cephalalgia.</hi> This word is uſed for all Pains of the Head in general; but properly it only ſignifies a new Pain of the Head. <hi>Cephalaea</hi> is an inveterate Pain of the Head: <hi>Hemierania</hi> the Pain of one ſide of the Head. It is alſo divided into external and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; Idiopathick and Sympathick; and of theſe, ſome are pricking, others heavy, and ſome beating; an inward pain of the Head is ſeated upon the Meninges, which lies deep, and reaches to the Roots of the Eyes; but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pain is ſeated upon the Pericranium, and is exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated when the Head is preſt, or the Roots of the Hair turned back.</p>
                  <p>An Idiopathick Pain is continual. This does not proceed from the diſorder of other parts: but a Sympatick Pain does. What that part is which communicates the pain to the Head may be eaſily known by the proper Signs of the affected part. The pain of the Head proceeds from a cold Cauſe, and from a hot Cauſe. For the Cure of the former, the Flegmatick Matter is to be evacuated by the following Pills.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pills of Ambar one Scruple and an half, of Cochiae Minor two Scruples and an half, of Tartar vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolated ten Grains, of Peruvium Balſam a ſufficient quantity; mingle them, make twelve Pills, give ſix of them once a Week in the Morning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Bath is very effectual in this caſe, the party being bathed, and his Head waſhed with it. Sneezing Powder is alſo very proper. Sudorifick Decoctions are alſo very beneficial in iinveterate pains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Sarſa parilla, and Gujacum, each two Ounces, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them twenty four hours in two Quarts of Fountain Water, upon hot Aſhes, and boil them over a gentle Fire till half is conſumed; add to it Coriander Seeds and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh, or of Sugar and Cinnamon as much as is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to give an agreeable taſte. Strain it, and keep it in a Glaſs; let him take half a Pint hot in a Morning,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65404:22"/>
for fifteen, twenty, or thirty days; and let him have more Cloaths on than ordinary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is to be noted in the uſe of Sudorifick decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ſome Purging Medicine muſt be given once a Week from the very beginning of the Cure: Specifick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies ſhould be uſed, and ſuch an one is the following Epithem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Powder of Zedoary one Draw, of the Waters of Bettony, Vervain, and Elder, each one Ounce; mingle them, apply it hot to the pained part, with Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let Cloth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the Specificks for the pain of the Head, from whatever Cauſe it ariſes, Vervain is the chief, whereof the diſtilled Water is applied to the Head, and taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to four Ounces, with four Drops of Spirit of Salt; and <hi>Foreſtus</hi> ſays, that he knew two ſick People that were Cured, by only hanging green Vervain about their Necks, when other Medicines were uſed to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>If the pain of the Head proceed from a hot Cauſe, give firſt a Glyſter, and then Bleed: But a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Blood is to be taken away when the Pain proceeds from Blood, than when Choler abounds. Afterwards ſome Medicines that Purge Choler muſt be given; not only when Choler is the chief Cauſe, but alſo when Blood is Luxuriant; for the thinner part ſoon turns to Choler. If by one Evacuation, the peccant matter is not ſufficiently purged, the Purging Medicine muſt be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at due diſtances of time, in the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe if the Belly be not fluid, Glyſters that are emollient, cooling, and gently Purging, are to be injected every day.</p>
                  <p>For pains of the Head, which come upon continual Feavers: Sheeps Lungs taken out hot and applied to the Head, do powerfully aſſwage the Pain: Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Seeds of white Poppies two Drams, of Saffron half a Scruple, of Camphor one Scruple, with a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity of Populeon Oyntment, ſpread them upon Leather, and apply them to the Forehead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And after general Evacuations, derivation may be ſucceſsfully uſed, by Bleeding in the Forehead with a Lancet, or with Leeches, and by applying Bliſters to the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65404:23"/>
Neck. In the mean while, the Humours muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperated by Juleps and Emulſions.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If the Pain be very violent, we muſt uſe Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks outwardly and inwardly.</p>
                  <p>In every Pain of the Head, from whatever Cauſe it ariſes, and will not yield to other Remedies; the Head muſt be ſhaved, and a large Bliſter applied all over it.</p>

                  <p>WHen the Sight is loſt, and there is no apparent fault in the Eye, it is occaſioned by the hindrance of the influx of the Animal Spirits into the Eyes.</p>
                  <p>An Obſtruction is the moſt ordinary cauſe of a Gutta Serena, which is generated by a Flegmatick Humour fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Brain into the Optick Nerves: But it is alſo certain, that this Diſeaſe is occaſioned by the compreſſion of the Optick Nerves; by Flegm coleated about them, or with Blood, or ſome other Matter heap'd up in that place, whereby Tumors are made in thoſe places; and Experience ſhews, that an inflamation of the Brain, or Phrenſie in malignant Feavers occaſion Blindneſs. Laſtly, Wounds in the Head, whereby the Optick Nerves are cut, hinder the influx of the Animal Spirits to the Eyes.</p>
                  <p>This Diſeaſe is known by the Eyes ſeeming to continue in their Natural State, only the Pupil appears blacker and larger. But there is great difficulty in diſtinguiſhing the Cauſes of it; for though when it proceeds from Blood, or <hi>Pus,</hi> an Inflamation, Abſceſs, or Wound go before, yet
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65404:23"/>
no ſure Sign can be given to diſtinguiſh a compreſſion by a Flegmatick Humour from an Obſtruction. Yet we may in ſome ſort gueſs, becauſe in an Obſtruction only of the Optick Nerve, the Eyes are only affected: But if there be a compreſſion by Flegmatick Humours, gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the Roots of the Eyes, and the mamillary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, that Matter will either ſeiſe other parts of the Brain, and then the reſt of the Senſes, or all of them will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. But if it be ſeated only about the Optick Nerves, a Flegmatick Matter will be evacuated by the Noſtrils more plentifully than is uſual, and there will ſeem a weight to lie upon the forepart of the Head, eſpecially about the Eye-lids.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſticks, if the Sight be quite taken away by an Obſtruction of the Optick Nerves, the Diſeaſe is moſt commonly incurable; for we ſee that Obſtructions of other Nerves whereby a Palſie is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, is ſeldom or never Cured, eſpecially in thoſe that are Old. But if the Obſtruction be partial, and the Sight be only diminiſhed, there is more hope of Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, though a long courſe of Remedies, and a great deal of time is requiſite for the Cure.</p>
                  <p>But if this Diſeaſe proceed from Humours collected in the forepart of the Head, it is eaſier Cured. <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> mentions an Obſervation of one that loſt his Sight by taking a violent Vomit, and recovered it again by taking another: For the firſt by its Violence ſtirred the Humours too much, and forced them upon the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Nerves; but the other evacuated the Humours, and ſo Cured. There are other Obſervations of this kind; but it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that in theſe caſes where the Cure is ſo eaſily performed, the Humour is not ſtopt in the ſubſtance of the Nerves, but collected in the Brain about the Nerves.</p>
                  <p>For the Cure of this Diſeaſe; the Matter impacted into the Nerves, or adhering to them, which cauſes the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or Compreſſion, is to be evacuated, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, unleſs the whole Body be firſt evacuated: As <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, the Eye cannot be Cured before the whole Head, nor that before the whole Body.</p>

                     </gap>ed, which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65404:24"/>
ought to be attenuating, and moderately drying. And firſt an Air inclining to hot and dry ought to be choſen; but thick, cloudy, cold and rainy Air muſt be carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Meats of eaſie Digeſtion, and of good Juice, muſt be eaten; and ſuch as breed a thick Juice muſt not be uſed, as Pork, Geeſe, Peaſe, Cheeſe, and the like; alſo thoſe things that fill the Head with Vapours, as things made of Milk, and hot Spices, as Pepper, Ginger, and the like. The Bread muſt be made with Fennel-water, or the Seed of it muſt be mingled with it: But great Care muſt be taken, that Darnel is not mixed with the Wheat wherewith the Bread is made, which has been always accounted very injurious to the Eye. In Sauces and Broths, let the Sick uſe thoſe things which have an attenuating Faculty, as Hyſſop, Fennel, Marjoram, Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Sage, Eye-bright, and eſpecially Nutmegs, which ſtrengthen the Brain, and clear the Sight. Turneps ſhould be often eaten, and alſo Sparrows, and Pidgeons; Cold Herbs muſt be avoided, eſpecially Lettice, which is injurious to the Eyes. The Sick muſt be moderate in his Diet, and the Supper ſparing; and once or twice a Week, let him go to Bed without Supper: At Meals, inſtead of Salt, let him uſe the following Powder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of common Salt two Ounces, of Eye-bright dried two Drams, of Nutmeg one Dram, of Cinnamon two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; make a Powder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After every Meal let him take one Spoonful of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Powder:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Seeds of Coriander prepared half an Ounce, of the Seeds of Aniſe and Fennel each two Drams, of Cinnamon and Nutmegs each one Dram; of Eye-bright dried three Drams, of Sugar of Roſes, twice the weight of all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wine is not good in this Diſeaſe; becauſe it fills the Head with Vapours, and promotes fluxion; but a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Sarſaparilla ſweetned with Liquoriſh, and aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized with Coriander Seeds, is a proper Drink: But all cannot abſtain from Wine, or ſtrong Beer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dried Eye-bright infuſed in ſmall Wine or Beer, may be uſed ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>Sleep muſt be ſhorter than uſual; and lying on the Back muſt be avoided as much as may be; and the Sick
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65404:24"/>
muſt not Sleep after Dinner: He muſt be moderate in his Exerciſe, and his Body muſt be always kept Looſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being thus ordered, the Cure muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun with univerſal Evacuation; and he muſt be firſt purged with the following Medicine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Senna cleanſed half a Dram, of the Seeds of Fennel one Dram, of the Leaves of Bettony, Eye-bright, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain, each half an handful; of Liquoriſh three Drams; boil them in Fountain-water to three Ounces, ſtrain it, and diſſolve in it three Drams of Diaphaenicon, and an Ounce of the Syrup of Roſes; make a Potion to be taken in the Morning</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the firſt Purge, the Phyſician ought to conſider with himſelf, whether Bleeding is to be uſed: In Old People, or ſuch as are of a Flegmatick Conſtitution, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is not: But in thoſe that are young; and of a hot Conſtitution, eſpecially if there be Signs of Blood abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without controverſie, if it be uſed in time it may do much good; and where there are ſuch indications for Bleeding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> After Blood has been drawn from the Arm, the particular Veins of the Head may be opened, and thoſe which are near the Eyes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Forehead Vein, the Vein of the Temples, and in the Corner of the Eyes, near the Noſe: But it is more proper to apply Leeches to the Temples; and if they are ſet behind the Ears too, they may do much good. Some Practitioners relate, that ſome blind People have been Cured by Wounds in the Forehead, whereby the turgid Veins and Arteries have been emptied.</p>
                  <p>But if a ſuppreſſion of the Courſes has preceded this Diſeaſe, Blood is to be drawn from the lower Veins, or Leeches muſt be applied to the Hemorrhoids; afterwards the Body muſt be purged more exactly with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apozem.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Fennel, Sarſaparilla, Florentine, Orris Elecampane, each one Ounce, of the Leaves of Bettony, Marjoram, Balm, Eye-bright, Fennel, Vervain, the greater Celandine, each one handful, of Liquoriſh raſped, and Raiſins of the Sun cleanſed, each one Ounce, of the Seeds of Aniſe and Fennel each three Drams, of Senna cleanſed two Ounces, of Gummy Turbith, and Agarick newly trochiſcated, each two Drams, of Ginger and

                  </p>
                  <p>When all the Apozem is taken, give the following Pills.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Univerſal Evacuation being thus performed, Revulſion of the antecedent cauſe is to be made, and the conjunct cauſe is to be diſcuſſed, and carried off by derivation; to this end frictions of the extream Parts, eſpecially the lower Parts, are to be uſed: Cupping-glaſſes are to be applied to the Back and Shoulders without Scarification, eſpecially to the hinder part of the Head with Scarification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Humours are ſo powerfully drawn from the fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>At the ſame time, a Bliſter muſt be applied to the Neck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> An Iſſue made in the Neck with a Skean of Silk is very beneficial in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>A Potential Cautery applied to the Coronal Suture, has been ſucceſsful ſometimes, when nothing elſe would do good.</p>
                  <p>After univerſal Purging, a ſudorifick Diet is to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, of Sarſa, and the like; and after the uſe of the ſudorifick Decoction, the uſe of a ſulphureous Bath is very proper, to Bath in, and to waſh the Head with.

                  <head>CHAP. XV. Of Diſeaſes of the glaſſy Humour.</head>
                  <p>THE glaſſy Humour is placed under the Criſtaline, and is therefore made by Nature clear, that the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may be conveyed pure and clear to the Optick Nerves; if therefore the perſpicuity of it be ſullied by the mixture of any Humour, and it become dark, the Sight is more or leſs diminiſhed, proportionably to the degree of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, this Humour may be injured by being miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, namely, if part of it by a Blow or Contuſion is thruſt before the Criſtalin Humour; for then the Sight is darkned, for the glaſſy humour is thicker than the watry, and ſo the Species of Objects cannot be brought pure and ſincere to the Criſtaline Humour.</p>
                  <p>The former of theſe Diſeaſes can be known by no Signs; but be imagined only by reaſon: For this Humour cannot be ſeen, nor the diſpoſition of it known; therefore Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners, when they perceive no fault in the Eye, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found this with the Gutta Serena, and that without any damage to the Patient; for extraneous Humours poured upon the glaſſy Humour muſt be diſcuſſed by the ſame Remedies wherewith a Gutta Serena is wont to be Cured. But the vitiated ſituation of the glaſſy Humour may be known, by appearing like the White of an Egg under the Pupil; but it cannot be diſtinguiſhed from a ſuffuſion, unleſs the antecedent and procatarctick cauſes are well conſidered; for a ſuffuſion proceeds from a ſimple influx of the Humours: But this from the glaſſy Humour miſplaced by a Blow or Wound.</p>
                  <p>This Diſeaſe is incurable by Art: But ſometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be Cured by Nature; and therefore the whole buſineſs is to be left to her.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Chriſtaline Humour</hi> is the chief Inſtrument of Sight, and therefore more than the other Humours of the Eye, ought to retain its Purity and Perſpicuity, that it may render the Sight perfect; and if it recede from that Purity, the Sight is much obſtructed.</p>
                  <p>The chief Diſeaſe of the Criſtaline Humour is the change of it to a grey Colour, and this Diſeaſe happens in old Age, from a drying and thickning Cauſe: It is known by a deep and great whiteneſs that appears about the <hi>Pupil,</hi> and all things are ſeen through a Smoak and Cloud; but it is difficultly diſtinguiſhed from a Suffuſion, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents ſuch a Whiteneſs in the <hi>Pupil</hi>; upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, many Authors confound it with a Suffuſion: But thoſe that look carefully, may diſtinguiſh theſe two Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; for in a Suffuſion, the whiteneſs is in the <hi>Pupil,</hi> but in this it appears deep.</p>
                  <p>This Diſeaſe is incurable, eſpecially in old People, in whom the drineſs of the Parts cannot be mended.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the <hi>Criſtaline Humour</hi> may be vitiated in Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, when its broad part which is like a Lentil, is not exactly oppoſed to the hole of the <hi>Pupil,</hi> but is moved upward to downward, and then things appear double: But this fault of Sight is alſo occaſioned by Vapours, or by thin Flegm, that ſullies the <hi>Chriſtaline Humour.</hi> This often happens to People that are drunk. The ſecond ill Situation of the <hi>Chriſtaline Humour</hi> is, when it inclines for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or backward; if forward towards the <hi>Pupil,</hi> then things that are near are not plainly ſeen; but things that are at diſtance are; this happens moſt commonly to old People: If it be placed backward towards the Optick Nerve, things that are near are plainly ſeen; but things at diſtance not at all: This is called Purblindneſs, which is to be remedied only by Spectacles.</p>
                  <p>The third ill Situation of the <hi>Criſtaline Humour,</hi> is when it proceeds too much to the right or left, and this is called Squinting. But this is not only occaſioned by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65404:26"/>
the vitious Situation of the <hi>Criſtaline Humour,</hi> but alſo from the ill Diſpoſition of the Muſcles that move the Eyes, which is either natural, or occaſioned by a Convulſion or Palſie; which is to be cured by Paralytick Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, From a greater or leſſer Inverſion of the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaline Humour,</hi> other Vices of Sight may proceed; as when things that are ſtreight appear crooked; or upſide down; which happened to a Phyſician, as <hi>Sennertus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, who looking earneſtly upwards, removed the <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaline Humour.</hi>

                  <p>THE watery Humour is alter'd from its natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, when it is peccant in Quantity or Quality; when it is encreaſed or diminiſhed beyond meaſure, it cauſes a Dilatation, or Contraction of the Pupil, which are to be treated of in their Place: But when it is vitious in quality it becomes thick; it is cauſed by ſome other Humour flowing into it; this is called a Suffuſion, which is to be treated of here. This Diſeaſe, when it begins, and when the Sight is a little darkned, is called, <hi>A Suffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> But when ſomething is collected in the <hi>Pupil,</hi> like Water, it is called <hi>Water.</hi> Laſtly, when the Matter is wholly concreted in the <hi>Pupil,</hi> and wholly obſcures the Sight, it is called a <hi>Cataract.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is alſo a Suffuſion, which is Spurious, which proceeds from Vapours, tranſlated from the Stomach, and other Parts. A Flegmatick Humour is the chief and moſt ordinary Cauſe of a Suffuſion, yet ſome other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours may be mixed with it, at leaſt in a ſmall Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if Choler be mixed with it, it appears yellow; when Melancholy, black.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Humours are wont to flow to the Eyes, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they are weak, either naturally or occaſionally: To the natural Weakneſs belongs a prominence of the Eyes; for thoſe that have ſuch Eyes, are ſubject to Suffuſions; for prominent Eyes are wont to be large, and ſo fitter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Humours and Vapours. Some external Cauſes alſo occaſion weakneſs, as a Blow, Contuſion, Bathing, a Southerly and Rainy Seaſon, long continuing in the Sun, Smoak, hard Reading, eſpecially by a Candle, which occaſions a Fluxion of Humours upon the Eyes. The differences of Suffuſions ariſe from the thickneſs, quantity, or place where the Humour reſides, that occaſions them.</p>
                  <p>By reaſon of the greater, or leſſer thickneſs, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Sight is more or leſs; for if the Humour be thin, and ſerous, the Sight is but little obſtructed; if very thick, blindneſs is occaſion'd.</p>
                  <p>By reaſon of the quantity and place, the Humour poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes either all the <hi>Pupil,</hi> and then the Sight is equally obſtructed, which way ſoever it is directed to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; or it covers one part of the <hi>Pupil</hi> more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Objects are not ſeen whole, by looking di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, nor many at one time: But if the Humour be very ſmall, and is ſeated in the middle of the <hi>Pupil,</hi> the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects appear as if there were holes in them: But if the Matter be torn into various <hi>Corpuſcles,</hi> ſeated in various Parts of the <hi>Pupil,</hi> the appearance of Gnats is always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Eyes. Alſo Hair, Cobwebs, Circles about a Candle, and many other things.</p>
                  <p>The Diagnoſtick of this Diſeaſe is firſt to be directed to a legitimate Suffuſion, to diſtinguiſh it from a ſpurious, afterwards the various Sorts of a legitimate Suffuſion are to be enquired into.</p>
                  <p>A true Suffuſion ſeizes only one of the Eyes moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly; or if both, not at the ſame time, nor alike, which happens in a Baſtard Suffuſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> in a legitimate Suffuſion, ſomething dark ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the <hi>Pupil,</hi> which is not in a Spurious; but this Sign is not conſtant; for if the Suffuſion be generated from a thin and ſerous Humour, there is no change in the Eye, that Humour being ſcarce thicker than the watery Humour; upon which account, Phyſicians mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake it for a <hi>Gutta Serena.</hi> But this Suffuſion is eaſily diſtinguiſhed from a <hi>Gutta Serena</hi>; for in a <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:65404:27"/>
the Sight is wholly taken away, or much diminiſhed, no fault appearing in the Eye: But in a Suffuſion, which does not appear to the Sight, the Sick can ſee tolerably well; becauſe the ſerous Humour, from whence it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, is thin and clear; ſo that the ſpecies of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects can paſs through it like Glaſs; and then in a Sufful<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion, the Sight is not for the moſt part obſtructed in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Parts of the <hi>Pupil</hi>; but the Objects are ſometimes ſeen beſt, when they are placed directly oppoſite to the Eye, and ſometimes when they are placed towards the Corner; becauſe moſt commonly, there is a greater thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or thinneſs, in one part of the <hi>Pupil,</hi> than in another.</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In a true Suffuſion, the Symptoms are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual; but in a Baſtard Suffuſion, they are encreaſed or leſſened by intervals, as the Vapours riſe more or leſs to the Head; and ſo when the Stomach is empty, they are much leſs, than when it is full, for then a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Vapours ariſe from the Head, and then the Gnats, Cobwebs, and the like, appear only by intervals. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in a true Suffuſion, the Sight ſeems to paſs always through a Cloud, or thick Glaſs, which is the proper and Pathognomonick Symptom of it: But in a Baſtard Suffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Sight is ſometimes very good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE.</hi> The Cure is eaſier performed in <hi>Summer</hi> than in <hi>Winter.</hi> If a Suffuſion come upon an acute Fever, after a <hi>Peripneumonia,</hi> Frenſie, or violent Pains of the Head, it is very hard to cure. A confirm'd Suffuſion can be cured only by Couching. In a confirm'd Suffuſion, if having ſhut the other Eye, the <hi>Pupil</hi> is dilated, there is hope of a Cure by Couching, otherwiſe there is none; for then the Optick Nerve is obſtructed; and ſo the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits cannot come to the <hi>Pupil.</hi> A black Suffuſion can never be cured; and but very rarely, a green or yellow. A Suffuſion which repreſents the Objects by holes, is not to be Couched. Couching ſucceeds beſt when the Eye is full, and at its natural bigneſs, for if it be withered and ſmall, it will not ſucceed. This Operation muſt not be attempted in old Age, or in Child-hood, nor when, the Eye being preſſed with the Finger, the Suffuſion appears broader, and then returns to its wonted bigneſs and ſhape; for then it is not ripe: But if, being preſſed with the Finger, it does not alter its ſhape, it may be Couched.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65404:28"/>
When it is ripe, it is like a thin Skin, and may be wrapped round the Needle, and thruſt to the lower Part of the Eye.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of a Suffuſion is not to be directed only to the conjunct Cauſe; but alſo to the antecedent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Body, eſpecially the Brain, muſt be firſt well Purged, afterwards, the Humour obſtructing the <hi>Pupil</hi> muſt be difcuſſed, or removed ſome other way.</p>
                  <p>Which Indications being the ſame in a manner, as were propoſed for the Cure of a <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi> may be ſought for there.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all that Cure being premiſed, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for a <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi> we muſt proceed to thoſe Remedies which reſpect peculiarly the taking off the Matter, that is ſeated near the <hi>Pupil</hi>; and though To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Remedies may ſeem not to do much good, yet a due uſe of them is not to be rejected; for experience teaches, that incipient Suffuſions have been cured by Topical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when they have been uſed after general Evacuations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, you muſt begin with gentle Reſolvents, which muſt not dry too much, leſt the Matter of the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions ſhould be hardned, and ſo rendred unfit for Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; and Emollients are therefore to be mixed with the Reſolvents, to prevent the hardening of the Matter, and to render the reſolving of it more eaſie; to which end, the following Fomentation may be uſed at the beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves of Rue, Fennel, Eyebright, and the greater Celandine, each one handful, of the Seeds of Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nugreek one ounce, of the Flowers of Camomil and Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, each one pugil; boil them in three parts of Fountain Water, and one of Wine added at the end. Strain it, and foment the Eyes with it, with a ſoft Spunge Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening, and the Head being covered, the Steam of the Decoction may be received into the Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the very beginning of the Diſeaſe, when the Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion is beginning, and when Medicines are uſed for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, it will be proper to foment the Eyes with Red Wine, to hinder the Fluxion.</p>
                  <p>In the Progreſs of the Diſeaſe, a Fomentation of White Wine, wherein <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> has been infuſed, is very beneficial; and the Breath of a Child, having firſt chewed Fennel-ſeeds, received into the Eyes; and a Child, or a
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65404:28"/>
Whelp, licking the Eyes in the Morning, is alſo good; and Bread hot out of the Oven, mixed with Fennel-ſeeds, held to the Eyes, till they are moiſt with the Vapour of it. The foreſaid Remedies muſt be uſed in the Morning chiefly. At Night apply the following Cataplaſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Flower of Foenugreek-ſeed one ounce, of Aloes half an ounce, of Saffron one dram, make a fine Powder, mix it with White Wine, wherein </hi> Crocus Metallorum, <hi>has been infuſed, make a Cataplaſm to be applied hot at Bed time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many commend Pidgeons Blood dropped hot into the Eye; but becauſe the heat of it ſoon goes off, it were better to apply a young Pidgeon, before it has Feathers, cut in the middle, to the Eye. The Suffuſion being cured, either by Reſolving Medicines, or by Chirurgical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, care muſt be taken to preſerve the Eyes; for the Eyes being much weakned by the Diſeaſe, are ready to receive Fluxions; therefore Purging is to be uſed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and Iſſues are to be made to turn the Humours, and ſuch ſtrengthening things are to be uſed as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in a <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi> and the Eyes muſt be waſhed in the Morning, with Wine held in the Mouth till it is warm, and mixed with Sage chewed in the Mouth.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Spectacles that repreſent the Objects, neither greater nor leſſer than they are, preſerve the Sight much.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, all thoſe things are to be avoided which injure the Sight, and ſuch as help it are to be uſed.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea Tunica</hi> is ſubject to many Diſeaſes, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Rupture, Diſtortion, Dilatation and Conſtriction.</p>
                  <p>A Rupture may be occaſioned by an external Cauſe, as by a Bruiſe or the like, or by an internal, namely, by a great quantity of Humours extending, or breaking it: But this can never be cured by Art; the diſtorting of it happens from the firſt Conformation, when it ſticks on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65404:29"/>
every ſide to the horny Tunick; and this alſo can never be cured.</p>
                  <p>The Dilatation of the <hi>Pupil,</hi> which is the hole of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea Tunica,</hi> through which the Species of the Objects enter the Eye, injures the Sight, for that the Light enters in too great quantity; upon which account, ſuch as are troubled with a Dilatation of the <hi>Pupil,</hi> ſee better where there is a little Light, than where there is a great deal; and this ſhews the natural and the ordinary changes of the <hi>Pupil,</hi> which happen according to the more or leſs Light of the place we are in, for in a very light place the <hi>Pupil</hi> is contracted; and this is the Reaſon, that when we come out of a very light Place into another that is more obſcure, we can at firſt ſcarce ſee any thing, till the <hi>Pupil</hi> is gradually dilated to receive more light, and then things that could not be ſeen at firſt, plainly appear: and on the contrary, they that come put of a dark place into a very light place, can ſcarce bear the Light.</p>
                  <p>The preternatural Dilatation of the <hi>Pupil</hi> is either from the Birth, or ariſes from preternatural adventitious Cauſes, which are either internal, or external: The next and immediate of the Internals, is Extenſion of the <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> which is either from drineſs, or repletion; drineſs ſtretches the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> and renders the hole of the <hi>Pupil</hi> larger, as holes in Leather are larger when they are dry. This dry <hi>Intemperies</hi> is occaſioned by long Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by Fevers and other drying Cauſes. The Repletion of the <hi>Tunica <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea,</hi> it being extended on every ſide, renders the <hi>Pupil</hi> larger, and this is produced either by Wind or Vapours, or by Humours flowing upon the Eye, or by the watery Humour encreaſed above meaſure; and laſtly from a Swelling of the <hi>Tunica <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>va.</hi> To theſe Cauſes may be added a Convulſion of the Tunick, which chiefly appears in Fits of the Falling Sickneſs, and in Chldrens Convulſions.</p>
                  <p>The external Cauſes are a Fall, a violent Shaking, holding of the breath in Women in Travail, and in Trumpeters.</p>
                  <p>The Diagnoſtick of this Diſeaſe is not difficult, for the Dilatation of the <hi>Pupil</hi> may be perceived by the Eyes, eſpecially if before the Diſeaſe, the Phyſician know the natural largeneſs of it, and alſo if with the largeneſs of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65404:29"/>
the <hi>Pupil,</hi> the Sight is obſtructed; beſides, the natural largeneſs of the <hi>Pupil</hi> is known by ſhutting one Eye, for then the <hi>Pupil</hi> of the other is more dilated, which does not happen in a Dilatation, that is, a Diſeaſe, becauſe the <hi>Tunica <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vea</hi> is ſo much diſtended by the preternatural Cauſe, that it can be diſtended no further.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick; A Dilatation of the <hi>Pupil</hi> from the Birth, is incurable; and that which ariſes after, is difficult to Cure, eſpecially if Drineſs be the Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>C<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE.</hi> The Cure is to be varied, according to the variety of the Cauſes; and if it come from Drineſs, the whole Body muſt be refreſhed with moiſtning Medicines, and Nouriſhment, ſuch as is uſed in Hectick Fevers, the Body is alſo to be moiſtned with a Bath of hot Water and new Milk, if it be alſo frequently drop'd into the Eyes, eſpecially Womens Milk.</p>
                  <p>If it proceed from an Humour that fills the Eye, the-whole Body is to be Evacuated, and preſently the Hu,+mour wherewith the Eye is ſtopped muſt be diſcuſſed which may be ſufficiently performed by the Remedies preſcribed in the Cure of a Suffuſion: But after them Aſtringents may be uſed, to contract the <hi>Pupil</hi> of the Eye; to which end the following <hi>Collyrium</hi> may be uſed.</p>

                  <p>If it proceed from Wind, after general Evacuations, thoſe Medicines are to be uſed, which expel Wind, and the Eyes may be fomented with a Decoction of Fennel, Rue, Dill, Red Roſes and Myrtles, made in Roſe-water, and a fourth part of White Wine. Laſtly, if it be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by a Bruiſe, it muſt be cured like an <hi>Ophthalma,</hi> if there be an Inflammation; but if there be no Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, apply at the beginning a Cataplaſm made of Bean Flower, the Leaves of Plantane, Red Roſes, and Roſe-water: But afterwards, Pidgeons Blood muſt be often drop'd into the Eye; which is an excellent Remedy for all Wounds and Bruiſes of the Eyes.</p>

                  <p>THE Narrowneſs of the <hi>Pupil</hi> is alſo injurious to the Sight: It is either narrow from the Birth, and then it is no great Injury; for though they cannot ſee ſo well as others in a Place where there is not much light, yet they ſee better in a very light Place; or the Narrowneſs of the <hi>Pupil</hi> is occaſioned by preternatural Cauſes, as from too great moiſture, or drineſs, from a Defect in the Watery Humour, or for want of Spirits.</p>

                  <p>THE natural Conſtitution of the <hi>Cornea</hi> is altered, when it loſes its Perſpicuity, or changed into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colour. It loſes its clearneſs, when it grows thick by drineſs, which often happens in old People, and is never to be cured: Or it is thickned by groſs Humours ſtuff'd into it; which frequently happens in an <hi>Ophthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>; when, by reaſon of too great an uſe of Reſolvent Remedies, the thinner Parts of the Humours are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, the thick remaining behind: Or when by cooling Medicines uſed too often, the Humours are thickned; and then the Horny Tunick is not only thicker in that Part where the Humour is impacted; but it alſo turns white, and is called <hi>Leucoma,</hi> or <hi>Albugo</hi>; but ſuch a Diſeaſe is alſo occaſioned by the Cicatrix of a Wound, whereby the <hi>Cornea</hi> is rendred thicker, and loſes its clearneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65404:30"/>There are ſeveral ſorts of it, as it is more or leſs thick; one only poſſeſſes the Superficies of the <hi>Cornea,</hi> another is ſeated deep, and penetrates the whole <hi>Cornea</hi>; one is greater, and poſſeſſes the whole <hi>Pupil,</hi> or the greateſt Part of it; another is ſmall, and covers only a ſmall Part of the <hi>Pupil,</hi> and then it is called a Spot.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cornea</hi> is alſo infected with a different Colour, when Blood is poured off upon it, and then it is called <hi>Suggillatio,</hi> and then all the Objects appear red; or when Choler inſinuates it ſelf into it, which often happens in the Jaundice, and then the Objects appear yellow.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Diſeaſes do not want peculiar Diagnoſticks; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are apparent.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſticks: An <hi>Albugo</hi> which proceeds from Flegm, or from a groſs Humour remaining after an <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> is eaſily cured, if it be not inveterate: But that which is occaſioned by a <hi>Cicatrix,</hi> is very difficultly cured; becauſe Parts of exquiſite Senſe, can ſcarce bear ſuch ſharp Remedies, as are neceſſary to take off the <hi>Cicatrix.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cure of an <hi>Albugo,</hi> occaſioned by Flegmatick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, concreted in the <hi>Cornea,</hi> muſt be performed by emollient, diſcutient, and attenuating Medicines: But univerſal Remedies muſh be premiſed, which carry off the antecedent Cauſe, and prevent a new influx of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, ſuch are ſet down in the Cure of a Suffuſion, and <hi>Gutta Serena</hi>; afterwards a Fomentation is to be applied with ſoft Spunges, to mollifie the concreted Matter, made of the Decoction of Foenugreek, Melilot, Celandine and Fennel, or the Vapour of this Decoction, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Eyes: Preſently after diſcuſſing Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are to be uſed, ſuch as are preſcibed for the Cure of a Suffuſion; and attenuating Eye Medicines, and ſuch as reſolve the Humour impacted in the Eye, eſpecially ſuch as are made of Honey diſtilled, are to be uſed; for the Water of diſtilled Honey, is very good to take out Spots from the Eyes; if the uſe of it be long continued. Sugar-Candy diſſolved in Eyebright, Celandine, or Fennel-water, is alſo good, and let the Eye be often licked, with a Boy's or Girl's Tongue, they having firſt chewed Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in their Mouths. <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> ſays, that he cured a Girl of twelve Years of Age, that had thick Clouds in

her Eyes with the following Collyrium, having firſt uſed the Decoction Sarſa for three Weeks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take two Pound of Honey in the Comb, of the Tops of Fennel, of the Flowers of Elder, and Eyebright, each two Pugils, of Sugar-Candy two ounces; diſtil them in a Bath, and drop the Water into the Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Juice of Fennel freſh drawn with one drop of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian Balſam in it, diſcuſſes powerfully an <hi>Albugo</hi>; the Oil of burnt Rags mixt with the Spittle of a Boy, being applied with a Feather, is alſo good. This Oil is drawn by firing a Rag, and extinguiſhing it between two Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; when it is cold, the drops of Oil will ſtick to the Platter.</p>
                  <p>But an <hi>Albugo,</hi> or a Spot, occaſioned by a Cicatrix, is cured by thoſe Remedies which mollifie, attenuate, and diſſolve; but becauſe thoſe things that take off the Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix are Acrimonious, the greater care ought to be taken, that univerſal Evacuations and Revulſions are firſt uſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt Humours ſhould flow to the Part; afterwards it will be convenient to uſe ſuch Fomentations which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above; and then diſcutient and abſterſive Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are to be applied. Firſt, thoſe that are gentle, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Compound Water of Honey above deſcribed: But afterwards ſtronger, as the Galls of Fiſh, of the Pike, and the like: Alſo of other Animals, as of the Partridge, Cock, Gooſe, Bull, and the like; alſo the Juices of the greater Celandine, the leſſer Centaury, Brooklime, and the like, which are to be mixed with Honey, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Honey is diſcutient, and abſterſive, alſo becauſe Liquors drop'd into the Eye, run preſently to the Corners, and will not ſtay upon the <hi>Pupil,</hi> upon which they ought to work; but when they are mixed with Honey, they eaſily ſtick to it; but by reaſon of their ſharpneſs, the foreſaid Juices or Galls may be thickned with the Mucilage of Gum Tragacanth, <hi>Pſyllium,</hi> or Quinces extracted in Penny-royal or Eye-bright Water, the form of a Collyrium with Juices may be ſuch as follows.</p>

                     <hi>Take of the Juice of Fennel, Celandine and Brook-lime, each three Drams, of the Juice of the leſſer Centaury half an ounce, of white Honey one ounce; mingle them like a Liniment; </hi> if with the <hi> Albugo </hi> there is a redneſs of the Eyes, the Collyrium made of White Wine,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65404:31"/>
Salt and Wheat, deſcribed in the Chapter of an <hi> Ophthalmia, </hi> is good, or the following may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Aloes and Agarick, each one ſcruple, powder them, and tie them up in a Rag, and infuſe them in Eye-bright or Fennel-water, and rub the Eyes with it, Morning and Evening. </hi> The Aloes cleanſes, ſtrengthens, and ſtops Fluxions, and the Agarick is very abſterſive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Suggilatio,</hi> or the red Colour of the Eyes, occaſioned by Blood pour'd upon them; if it be freſh, may be eaſily cured, by dropping Pidgeons Blood into the Eyes, or for want of it Womans Milk with a little Frankincenſe and Saffron, or the Yolk of an Egg with Wine may be uſed. But if the Diſeaſe be obſtinate, the Eye muſt be fomented with a Decoction of Foenugreek, Marſh mallows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fennel, Rue, and Celandine; or the Steam of the Decoction may be received into the Eyes. Laſtly, all thoſe things that we preſcribed for a Suffuſion, are proper for the Cure of this Diſeaſe: But when the Diſeaſe is inveterate, and when that which was red begins to turn black, the Tops of Hyſſop wrap'd in a Rag, and dipp'd in boiling Water, and applied to the Eye, are particularly recommended by <hi>Galen</hi>; and Experience ſhews, that this Remedy is ſo very effectual; that the Blood is apparently drawn out, and ſticks to the Rag.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, the yellow Colour, which appears in the Eyes of thoſe that have the Jaundice, goes off of its own accord when the Diſeaſe is cured: But if you deſire to haſten the Diſſipation of it, the Steam of Vinegar received in the Eyes, will do it.</p>

                  <p>If the Fluxion ariſe from the inward Parts of the Head, there will be a Head-ach, that reaches to the Roots of the Eyes: But if the Fluxion paſs by the outward Veſſels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eyes, the Pain of the Head is more external; the Veins of the Forehead are diſtended, and a Pulſation is perceived in the Temples.</p>
                  <p>In order to the Cure of an <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> a cooling and moiſtening Diet muſt be appointed, and ſuch Meats as eaſily digeſt; and rather boiled than roaſted; Spoon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Meats rather than ſolid; the Patient muſt avoid Acrid, Salt, and Pepper'd Meats, and ſuch as fill the Head with Vapours; Milk, Sugar, and all ſweet things, muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65404:32"/>
Wine is not good in the beginning; but inſtead of it, a Ptiſan of Liquorice and Barly, or ſome other cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liquor muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>Sleep is very beneficial, becauſe the Motion of the Eye then ceaſes, whereby the Pain and Fluxion are excited, the Sick ſhould lie with his Head high on the well ſide: All Motion of the Body muſt be forbid; and Talking, and the Belly muſt be kept open: The Patient muſt keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf free from Paſſions, eſpecially from Anger.</p>
                  <p>The Air muſt be temperate, and pure, and free from Smoak, Duſt and Winds, and the Room muſt be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Eye muſt be covered with Black, Green or Sky-coloured Cloth; the well Eye muſt be alſo covered; becauſe, when that moves to view an object, the other is alſo moved.</p>
                  <p>The Courſe of Diet being thus appointed, the external Cauſes, from whence it moſt commonly ariſes, muſt be removed. A Collyrium muſt be preſently prepared, made of Roſe and Plantane-water, the white of an Egg, and of Womans Milk, and let it be dropp'd into the Eyes often in a Day; and a Rag dipp'd in it muſt be applied over at the ſame time Sleep muſt be indulged as much as may be; for it much furthers the Concocting, or diſcuſſing of the Morbifick Matter. If the Diſeaſe be not taken off with theſe things, Remedies for a true <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> are to be uſed in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>A Clyſter muſt be firſt injected, and Blood muſt be drawn from the Part oppoſite to the Part affected, and Bleeding muſt be repeated, till a ſufficient Evacuation and Revulſion are made; for this Diſeaſe has been often cured by Bleeding alone; but reſpect muſt be had to the Age, the Sex, and Conſtitution of the Sick; and in thoſe that have had ſome accuſtomed Evacuation ſuppreſſed, as of the Courſes or Hemorrhoids, the inferior Veins muſt be opened, or Leeches muſt be applied to the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids. But after a ſufficient Evacuation of Blood has made, by Vene-ſection, Revulſion muſt be alſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, by applying Cupping-glaſſes, with, and without Scarification, to the Back and Shoulders, Frictions and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures are alſo uſed to the Inferior Parts; and to the foreſaid Revulſions, Derivation is to be joined, which is made by opening the Veins of the Forehead and Temples,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65404:33"/>
and in the Angle of the Eye; ſome apply Leeches to the Temples, or behind the Ears; all which kinds of Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are very uſeful after ſufficient Evacuations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> commends the opening of the Arteries of the Temples, when the <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> proceeds from very hot and boiling Blood: And though this kind of Remedy is ſeldom uſed in our Age; yet it is very beneficial, and without danger; for in thoſe leſſer Arteries, by Ligature only, the Blood may be ſtopp'd.</p>
                  <p>Bliſters are alſo of good uſe applied to the Neck, and behind the Ears; and after Bleeding has been ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently uſed, Purging muſt be ordered, that the hot Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours may be evacuated; but you muſt Purge with gentle Medicines, and ſuch as cool the Blood; as,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Tamarinds half an ounce, of Sena two drams, of Rhubarb one dram, and an half; infuſe them in Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Water: To three Ounces of the ſtrained Liquor, add of Manna, and of Syrup of Roſes ſolutive, each an ounce. Make a Potion to be taken in the Morning; or the following Bolus may be uſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Caſſia newly extracted ſix drams, double Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon three drams, Pouder of Rhubarb one dram, with a ſufficient quantity of Sugar; make a Bolus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a Flegmatick <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> Pills are frequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, as Pills of Agarick, and the like; which although they be very proper when the Diſeaſe is at its height, yet in the beginning, it is better to let them alone, leſt the Humours being put in a Commotion by the ſharpneſs of the Medicine, may cauſe a greater fluxion upon the Part. Neither is one Purge ſufficient, but they muſt be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeated, if the Diſeaſe prove tedious; convenient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations being premiſed, as Apozems and Juleps proper for the peccant Humour: In the firſt place, the heat of the Humours is to be temperated from the beginning of the Diſeaſe, by refrigerating and thickning Juleps, or with an Emulſion of the four greater cold Seeds, Lettice and white Poppy Seed, made with ſome cooling Decoction; to which may be added Roſe-water.</p>
                  <p>Univerſal Evacuations and Revulſions being premiſed, Topicks are to take place, and ſuch as are repelling from the beginning ought to be uſed. Nevertheleſs, the more rational Practitioners do adviſe, not to apply repelling
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65404:33"/>
Collyriums at the beginning of the Diſeaſe: Becauſe for the moſt part, they ſix the Humour that ſlows upon the Part, and ſo augment the pain and inflamation. <hi>Galen</hi> does cenſure an Oculiſt, becauſe he propoſed repelling Medicines to be uſed at the beginning of an inflamation. Nevertheleſs, aſtringent Medicines may be applied to the Forehead and the Temples at the very beginning of the Diſeaſe; becauſe by them the Veins by which the Humours fall upon the Eyes are compreſſed, and the Humour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. They may be made after this manner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Bole-armenick, Dragons blood, Frankincenſe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich, each one Dram; red Roſes, Balauſtins, and the Flower of Lentles, each two Scruples, mix them with the White of an Egg, and Vinegar of Roſes. Make a Cataplaſm to be applied to the Forehead and Temples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Cataplaſm made of the Juice of Nettles, and Wheaten Flower is eſteemed very effectual for ſtopping the Flux of Humours upon the Eye, being applied to the Forehead and Temples; ſometimes the Juice of Nettles by a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick quality does ſtop all manner of Fluxes of Blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either applied outwardly to the place, or taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, if the pain be very violent, which cauſes a Fluxion more and more upon the Eyes, anodine Medicines muſt be applied to the Eyes; of which the new Milk of an healthful Woman is the beſt, which is to be milk'd from the Breaſt into the Eye, inſtead of it new Cheeſe made of Sheeps Milk may be uſed: But it muſt be often changed, leſt it turn to Butter, and ſo augment the inflamation.</p>
                  <p>The White of an Egg beat into Water, is greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Galen,</hi> becauſe it eaſes Pain, and ſtops the Fluxion gently.</p>
                  <p>An Apple roaſted under Cinders does alſo greatly miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the pain of the Eyes.</p>
                  <p>The Mucilages of the Seeds of Fleabean, Quinces, and Fenugreek Seeds extracted with Roſe-water, do greatly eaſe Pain; they muſt be changed once in two days, leſt they become ſharp. Of theſe, ſeveral Compoſitions may be made upon occaſion: For example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pap of a ſweet Apple roaſted under the Cinders one Ounce, of the Mucilages of the Seeds of Pſyllium
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65404:34"/>
and of Quinces extracted in Roſe-water, each ſix Drams, of the Liquor of the White of a new Egg, and Womans Milk, each one Ounce: Make a Cataplaſm to be applied to the Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pieces of Kids, Calves or Sheeps Fleſh new kill'd, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently applied to the Eyes, powerfully eaſe Pains.</p>
                  <p>A more ſimple Cataplaſm may be made of Crums of Bread moiſtned in Womans Milk and Roſe-water.</p>
                  <p>But if the Pain be vehement, and intolerable, Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks muſt be uſed, but ſparingly, and with Caution; becauſe they condenſe the Spirits that ſerve for Sight, and thicken the Coats of the Eye, and the Humours, and ſo dull the Sight. Amongſt the Ocular Narcoticks, <hi>Trochiſci Albi Rhaſis</hi> with Opium, are the beſt, which may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed after this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Roſe Water two Ounces, the White of an Egg ſtrongly beaten one Ounce, Trochiſci Albi Rhaſis with Opium one Dram; make a Collyrium to be dropt into the Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Pain is abated, repelling Medicines are to be uſed, which ought to be moderate, and anodine Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are to be always mixed with them; to this end the following Collyrium uſes to be preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Plantane-water, Roſe-water, each an Ounce and an half, Liquor of the White of an Egg an Ounce, Trochiſci Albi Rhaſis, without Opium, one Dram; make a Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium to be often dropt into the Eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Pain be more ſharp, Womans Milk, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned Mucilages may be added to the Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</p>
                  <p>The following Remedy powerfully abates the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſtops the Fluxion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take the white of one Egg, beat it with a pretty big piece of Allum in a Tin Platter; ſtir it until it has got the conſiſtence of an Ointment: ſpread it upon a Rag, and apply it warm to the Eyes; romove it in the ſpace of two Hours; leſt by ſtaying too long, it fix the Humours in the Eye, by the aſtringent force which is in the Allum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sal Saturni</hi> diſſolved in Roſe-water or Oxycrate, or mixed with Pomatum, does powerfully extinguiſh the Inflammation of the Eyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:65404:34"/>In the augmentation of the Diſeaſe, digeſting Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are to be mixed with repelling Medicines; therefore to the above-mentioned Collyriums may be added, Waters of Eye-bright, Fennel, Celandine, and the Mucilages of the Seeds of Flax, Marſh-Mallows, Foenugreek. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> chiefly commends the Decoction of Foenugreek Seeds; becauſe it Digeſts, Concocts, and moderately repels.</p>
                  <p>When the Diſeaſe is at a height, Sarcocol is alſo added to Collyriums, which digeſts a little more powerfully: But becauſe it hurts the Eyes by its Acrimony, it is fit to infuſe it ſome days in Milk, often changed before it be uſed, and a ſmall quantity of it ought to be prepared at once; for after it is long kept it turns ſharp, and is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Eyes, it may be uſed after this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Flowers of Melilot, Camomil, red Roſes, each one pugil, of the Seeds of Foemigreek well cleanſed one dram; boil them in Plantane-water: in four ounces of the ſtrained Liquor, diſſolve a dram of Sarcocol prepared, of Tutty prepared, and </hi> Trochiſci albi Rhaſis <hi>without Opium, each half a dram, make a Collyrium.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Crollius,</hi> and the reſt of the Chymiſts, greatly commend Salt of Saturn diſſolved in Roſe-water, to which may be added ſome Grains of <hi>Sal Ammoniacum</hi>: It may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed after this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of </hi> Sacharum Saturni <hi>three grains, of Salt</hi> Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacum <hi>three grains, Roſe-water three ounces; mix them, and drop of it into the Eyes Morning and Night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Water made of white Vitriol, it being diſſolved in Red Roſe-water or Plantane-water is commonly uſed; as, <hi>Take of White Vitriol one ſcruple, diſſolve it in four ounces of Plantane or Roſe-water; ſtrain it,</hi> and drop it into the Eyes: If it be too ſharp, it muſt be qualified by mixing more Water with it.</p>
                  <p>Many Ointments are alſo commended for the Cure of an <hi>Ophthalmia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of prepared Tutty an ounce and an half, of Camphor one dram, of Verdigreaſe grains twelve; powder the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65404:35"/>
and the Tutty together in a Mortar, and the Verdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe by it ſelf, all of them muſt be very finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; then take of freſh Butter one Ounce, of Roſe-water one dram, boil them together gently, and having taken them from the Fire, mix by degrees, firſt the Tutty with the Camphor, afterwards the Verdigreaſe; ſtrain them through Silk, and make an Oyntment; Anoint the inward part of the Eye-lids, eſpecially about corners, with this Oyntment.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>This Fomentation may be alſo uſed at the beginning or declination of the Diſeaſe; it muſt be applied hot in the Winter and warm in the Summer.</p>
                  <p>The Oyl of Rags, or the Liquor which is drawn from Rags, burnt and extinguiſhed betwixt two Platters, is excellent to diſcuſs an <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> a drop of it mixed with a Childs Spittle, being put into the Eye with a Feather.</p>

                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:65404:35"/>A Decoction of Hyſſop is excellent to take off the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which remains at laſt.</p>
                  <p>But an inveterate <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> which has continued many Years, requires a ſomewhat different and longer Method of Cure. If it proceed from a hot Intempories, then ſuch Remedies as correct it are to be uſed; after Bleeding, and convenient Purging Baths, Whey, and Vitriolick Mineral Waters, and Leeches applied to the Hemorrhoids, do much good.</p>
                  <p>But if the matter of an <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> ariſe only from an Intemperies of the Brain, from whence Flegmatick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours flow to the Eyes with ſomewhat of Blood; then care muſt be taken to purge the Brain twice, thrice or four times in a Month, and a Seaton muſt be made in the Neck, and Maſticatories are of uſe.</p>
                  <p>But if the Brain want to be more dried, Sudorifick Decoctions of <hi>China, Sarſaparilla,</hi> and the like, muſt be uſed, and the Reſolvent Fomentation and Oyntment men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above are to be applied, and the following Water is very effectual.</p>

the Patient upright in a Chair, and holding his Head on both Sides, and ſuddenly ſhaking it, the Matter ſunk down: But if this will not do, <hi>Galen</hi> propoſes to Cure it by Puncture, as in a Suffuſion: But for this Operation, the moſt skilful Chirurgion muſt be procured.</p>

                  <p>IN the Tunicks, called <hi>Cornea</hi> and <hi>Adnata,</hi> as in other Parts of the Body, are wont to be generated ſmall Bladders full of Water, like the Bladders which ariſe from Scaulds; they are of the bigneſs of Millet Seeds, and are occaſioned by acid and watery Humours, they are eaſily known, for they appear to Sight: Thoſe that ariſe in the <hi>Adnata,</hi> are of a red Colour; but thoſe in the <hi>Cornea,</hi> are blackiſh, when they are placed upon the Superficies of it; but they are white, if they lie deep. Thoſe that are ſeated in the <hi>Adnata,</hi> are not ſo dangerous as thoſe in the <hi>Cornea,</hi> the ſuperficial is leſs dangerous than they that are deep.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of then muſt be performed, by reſolving the conjunct Matter, and by turning the antecedent Cauſe the other way, and great care muſt be taken to hinder Suppuration; wherefore univerſal Evacuations, Revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Derivations, which were propos'd in the Cure of an <hi>Ophthalmia,</hi> are alſo of uſe here.

                  <p>ULCERS in thoſe Tunicks uſe to follow an <hi>Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmia,</hi> when it comes to Suppuration; they alſo follow the breaking of the Bladders in the <hi>Cornea</hi>: They are alſo occaſioned by ſharp and corroding Humours, that fall upon the Eyes. Great variety of them are propoſed by Authors, according to the various Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>They are eaſily known, becauſe they appear to Sight: If the Ulcer be in the <hi>Cornea,</hi> it appears white in the black of the Eye; if it be in the <hi>Adnata,</hi> a red Spot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the white of the Eye. Theſe Ulcers are very hard to Cure, and dangerous; but much more in the <hi>Cornea,</hi> than in the <hi>Adnata.</hi> That which is near the <hi>Pupil</hi> is moſt dangerous; becauſe when it is cured, a Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix is left behind, which ſpoils the Clearneſs of the Sight.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe, as of other Ulcers, is to be perform'd by cleanſing and drying Medicines, but they muſt be very gentle, by reaſon of the ſoftneſs and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Senſe of the Part; but thoſe things are to be uſed firſt which ſtop the Fluxion: Such are to be found in the Chapter of an <hi>Ophthalmia.</hi> If there be alſo an Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Pain, Medicines reſpecting both muſt be added to the former.</p>
                  <p>Moderate cleanſing and drying Medicines are, Sugar, Honey, Saffron, Myrrh, Frankincenſe, Aloes, Sarcocol, Tutty, and Ceruſs, whereof the following Forms may be compoſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Decoction of Barly and Foenugreek four ounces, of the beſt Hony half an ounce, or of Syrup of dried Roſes one ounce; make a Collyrium, wherewith waſh the Eye often;</hi> or,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take an Egg boiled hard, and clear'd from the Shell, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into two parts, take out the Yolk, and fill the hole with Sugar-Candy powder'd, bind it up, and ſet it in a Cellar, and a Liquor will drop from it, which is very fit to cleanſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers; if you would have it operate more powerfully, you muſt mix powder'd Myrrh with the Sugar-Candy.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>A Cancer of the Eye, is either occult or ulcerated: An occult is called a Cancerous Tumor; when it is ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, it is called a cancerous Ulcer; in both there is an unequal hardneſs, and a leaden and livid Colour, great and pricking Pain, eſpecially about the Temples, the Veins appear ſwoln like a Varix, in the Tumour, and in the Neighbouring Parts, ſharp Blood frequently flows our, when the Cancer is ulcerated; and the Pain is very much exaſperated by Medicines, that are never ſo little heating.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:65404:38"/>This Diſeaſe is incurable, both in the Eye and in other Parts of the Body when it is rooted, unleſs it be irradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by a Chirurgical Operation.</p>
                  <p>Two ſorts of Cures are propoſed by Authors, <hi>viz.</hi> a true one, and a palliative.</p>
                  <p>The true one can be performed only by Chirurgery, the palliative Cure, which mitigates the Symptoms, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by Evacuations and convenient Topicks. But firſt of all, a cooling and moiſtning Courſe of Diet muſt be ordered, afterwards Blood muſt be drawn from the Part oppoſite to the Eye affected, and Leeches muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied behind the Ears of the ſame ſide, and to the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoidal Veins, if they are any whit ſwelled: Cupping-glaſſes muſt be alſo applied to the Shoulders, and other ſorts of Revulſions muſt be uſed.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Remedies hinder the influx of the Humours into the Eyes, and much leſſen the Pain and other Symptoms: But Topical Remedies, ſuch as are deſcribed in the Chapter of an <hi>Ophthalmia</hi> to eaſe pain, do alſo much good, eſpecially <hi>Collyria</hi> made of Mucilages, of the white Troches of Rhaſis, of Tutty prepared, and with the Water of Roſes, Night-ſhade and Plantane.</p>
                  <p>The following Water is excellent for waſhing the Eye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of the greater Figwort, and of Herb-Robert, each two handfuls, of Ribwort, Night-ſhade, Borrage, Bugloſs, Purſlain, Eye-bright, Betony, each one handful, of green Frogs, and of the white of Eggs, each number ſeven, of the Seeds of Foenugreek and Quinces each one ounce; the Roots and Seeds muſt be beat, and the Leaves cut; then pour upon them of Roſe-water and Eye-bright water, each one pint: mingle them, and diſtil them in a leaden Still.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fleſh of Pullets eaſes the Pain much, and ſome ſay this Diſeaſe has been cured by this Remedy only.</p>
                  <p>A Lady that had an ulcerous Cancer upon all the right ſide of her Face a long while, and had uſed various Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that were preſcribed by <hi>Italian, French, German,</hi>

                  <p>HItherto the Diſeaſes of the Eyes, which happen in the Tunicks or Humours of them, have been treated of. It remains now, that we ſpeak of the Diſeaſes of the Eye-lids, and of the Corners of the Eyes. And firſt, the Tumour appearing betwixt the greater Angle of the Eye, and the Root of the Noſe offers it ſelf, it is called <hi>Oegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops,</hi> and <hi>Anchylops. Anchylops,</hi> before it is broken: But <hi>Oegylops,</hi> after it is broken. This Tumor, or rather Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercle, is ſometimes with an Inflammation, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without; when it is accompanied with an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it is red about and painful, and is occaſioned by thin and cholerick Blood, brought by the Veins of the Temples, Forehead, and Face to the Part, and for the moſt part degenerates into a ſinuous Ulcer, and then it is called <hi>Fiſtula Lachrimalis</hi>; which if it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues a Year, occaſions a Caries of the Bone, which may be known by the Cavity it makes, by the ſtinking
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65404:39"/>
Matter, and the roughneſs that is perceived by the Probe.</p>
                  <p>This Tubercle alſo comes without an Inflammation, and then it is generated by a groſs and viſcid Humour, that reſembles Honey; then it is to be reckoned with thoſe Tumors which are called <hi>Atheroma, Steatoma,</hi> and <hi>Meliceris,</hi> which are wont to be without Pain.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of an <hi>Oegylops</hi> is very difficult, becauſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines can be hardly applied, by reaſon of the nearneſs of the Eye, and becauſe by reaſon of the ſoftneſs of the Parts, it eaſily degenerates into a Sinous Ulcer: But is yet more difficult to Cure, if the Abſceſs paſs through the Noſtrils, and Matter flow through them; becauſe the Bones that are under, are moſt commonly fouled thereby.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes an <hi>Oegylops</hi> is of the Nature of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, which may be known by the pricking pain, the ſwelling of the Veins, and the hardneſs and livid Colour of the Skin; and then it is better not to meddle with it, for Medicines make it worſe, and increaſe the Pain.</p>
                  <p>A new <hi>Fiſtula Lachrimalis,</hi> which hath an outward and plain Orifice, is cured by Medicines; but that which is deep and inveterate, and joined with a Caries of the Bone can ſcarce be cured without a Cautery.</p>
                  <p>The various Seaſons of this Diſeaſe require different Applications and Remedies, and firſt at the beginning of an <hi>Oegylops,</hi> Revulſion of the Fluxion to the Part muſt be made by Bleeding and Purging, and at the ſame time repelling Medicines muſt be applied to the Forehead, whereby ſometimes the Progreſs of the Diſeaſe is ſtopp'd, and the ſuppuration hindred. To which end the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cerate may be applied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Pomgranate Peel, of Acacia, Balauſtins, Cype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus Nuts, Roch Allum, and Bole Armoniack each one Dram, of white Wax four ounces, of Turpentine three drams; make a Cerate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having uſed this or the like, reſolving Medicines are to be applied to the Part for ſome time, as is the following Decoction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of pure Honey, and of Aloes each two ounces, of Myrrh one ounce, of Saffron one dram and an half, of Water a quart; boil them with a gentle Fire, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65404:40"/>
of half: dip a piece of ſoft Spunge, preſs it a little, and apply it hot, afterwards bind it on, and change it often.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Tumor cannot be diſſolved by the foreſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, but tends to Suppuration, it muſt be helped by a Plaiſter of ſimple Diachylon, or if the Pain and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be violent, a Cataplaſm of Crums of Bread may be conveniently applied. If the Abſceſs does not break of its own accord, it muſt be preſently opened; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Matter will corrode the neighbouring Parts, and occaſion an incurable Fiſtula.</p>
                  <p>The Abſceſs being opened, the Ulcer muſt be cleanſed, and cured after the manner of other Ulcers: But if it prove obſtinate, and turn to a Fiſtula, the following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, univerſal Evacuations, as Bleeding and Purging are to be repeated: The Fluxion from the Head is to be averted by Cupping-glaſſes, Bliſters, and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks applied to proper Places; after which a Decoction of China or Sarſa may be uſed for a conſiderable time: In the mean time, the Brain is to be dried by Suffumiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Cephalick Powders, and other Medicines propoſed in the Chapter of a <hi>Catarrh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In place of an Iſſue, a Seton may be put in the Neck, by which alone a <hi>Fiſtula Lachrimalis</hi> was cured, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Relation of <hi>Fabritius Hildanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In uſing of Topicks, the Orifice of the Ulcer is to be opened, and dilated ſlowly and by degrees, by a Tent made of the Pith of Elder, prepared Spunge, or the Root of Gentian. The Ulcer being ſufficiently opened, the following Medicines may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of common Hony two ounces, Verdigreaſe one dram, Water of Rue four ounces, the Verdigreaſe being pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, boil them altogether, to the Conſumption of the third part. The ſtrained Liquor warm may be put into the Eye by a Syringe ſolftly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Remedy is to be continued for three Weeks, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the Ulcer a convenient Plaiſter, and defending the Eye by waſhing it with Roſe-water.</p>
                  <p>The Ulcer being ſufficiently cleanſed, the following Collyrium may be uſed to Incarnate and Cicatrize.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXX. Of an <hi>Epiphora.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BY the Name of an <hi>Epiphora</hi> in general, a flux of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours into any part whatſoever is underſtood. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, it is moſt commonly taken for the flux of a thin Humour from the Eyes, which is alſo called invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Tears, which uſe to flow from the Corners of the Eyes continually.</p>
                  <p>To the Production of theſe Tears; which preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flow from the Eyes, the ill diſpoſition both of the part ſending and the part receiving do concurr. The part which ſends is the Brain, which being affected with a cold or hot Intemperies, generates watery Humours, and ſends them to the inferior Parts, which are fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them.</p>
                  <p>The recipient Part is the gland by the greater Corner of the Eye, and the Caruncle placed above the ſame Corner: The thinneſs or thickneſs of which Parts, or any other weakneſs, is the Cauſe why they ſo eaſily receive the Humouts that flow into them.</p>
                  <p>This Humour is carried from the Brain into the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Eyes, ſometimes by the internal Veins, and ſometimes by the external.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:65404:41"/>The Humour cauſing an <hi>Epiphora</hi> is ſometimes cold, and then it produces no other Inconvenience to the Sick, but the troubleſomneſs of the Fluxion. But ſometimes it is accompanied with Saltneſs and Sharpneſs; and then it produces Pain, Redneſs, and alſo the Exulceration of the Eye-lids.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick; A new <hi>Epiphora,</hi> occaſioned by external Cauſes, is eaſily cured, eſpecially in thoſe that are Young. When it is of long continuance, and in an old Perſon, it is very hard to be cured. That which proceeds from other Diſtempers, as from an <hi>Oegylops, Fiſtula Lachrimalis,</hi> and the like, altogether depends upon the Cure of thoſe Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe conſiſts in taking away of the Fluxion, and in ſtrengthening the recipient Part.</p>
                  <p>The Fluxion is to be removed by Evacuation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion and Derivation of the Peccant Humour, and the ſtrengthening of the Part from which it is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                  <p>The Peccant or Serous Humour abounding in the Brain, is evacuated by Bleeding and Purging.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding in a cold <hi>Intemperies</hi> of the Brain, is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, unleſs there appears manifeſt Signs of a <hi>Plethora.</hi> But in a hot <hi>Intemperies,</hi> when the Humours are ſharp, Bleeding is very proper, and may be repeated twice or thrice, if it be needful.</p>
                  <p>Such Purging Medicines muſt be uſed as agree with the Nature of the Patient.</p>
                  <p>Revulſion of the Humour muſt be made by Cupping-Glaſſes applied to the Shoulders often, by Bliſters fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently applied to the Neck, or by Iſſues in the hinder Part of the Head, or in the Arms. <hi>Foreſtus</hi> ſays, when the Diſeaſe is obſtinate, a Bliſter applied to the forepart of the Head does much good.</p>
                  <p>For Derivation, Leeches applied behind the Ears are proper, and Maſticatories uſed in a Morning.</p>
                  <p>And leaſt the Humours once evacuated ſhould be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated again, the Brain muſt be ſtrengthened and dried; and if it be of a cold <hi>Intemperies,</hi> ſuch things muſt be uſed, as are proper to correct it; if of a hot, ſuch cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Medicines muſt be uſed, as peculiarly reſpect the Head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65404:42"/>And whilſt the foreſaid Remedies are in uſe, Topical Remedies muſt be applied to the Part receiving, and firſt, if the Humour flows by the external Veins, aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents muſt be applied to the Forehead and Temples; and if the Fluxion proceed from an hot an acrid Humour, the following Cataplaſm muſt be applied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Bole Armenic, Dragons Blood, Balauſtines, and of Myrtles each one dram and an half, of Acacia and Hypociſtis each one dram of Frankincenſe and Maſtich each two ſcruples, of red Roſes one pugil; pouder them, and mix them with the white of an Egg, and a little Vinegar, make a Cataplaſm, wrap it in a Rag, and apply it to the foreſaid Parts, and when 'tis dry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be occaſioned by a cold Humour, the following Cerate muſt be applied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Frankincenſe and Maſtick each one dram, and an half, of Gum Anime Tacamahacca and Blood-ſtone each one dram, of Gum Juniper two ſcruples, of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine and Wax a ſufficient quantity, make a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to the part affected, aſtringent and drying <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyria</hi> muſt be applied, made in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Tutty prepared one dram, of Sarcocol moiſtned half a dram, of Frankincenſe and Maſtich each half a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of Spikenard grains ſix; make Troches, mix them with the White of an Egg, and Juice of Quinces, and apply them to the Corner of the Eye.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Aloes, Cypreſs Nuts, Frankincenſe, Maſtich, Myrrh, each two drams, of prepared Tutty, Sarcocol moiſtned, each one dram and an half, of Dragons Blood, Barberries, Summach, Red Roſes each one ſcruple, powder them finely, and mix them with Fennel-water, and make a Collyrium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Fluxion is hot, the following is beſt:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of white Troches of Rhaſis without Opium, of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocol moiſtned, of Acacia and Olibanum each one dram, of the Stones of Myrobalans burn'd, of white and red Coral each half a dram, of Pearls half a ſcruple, of the Juice of Pomgranates boil'd half away, a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</hi> Make a Collyrium.</p>

                  <p>IT is a hard and nervous Membrane that ariſes from the greater Angle of the Eye; it firſt covers the White of the Eye, and then the Black, and the whole Pupil, and ſo it hinders Sight. Sometimes it is thin, and white, and ſometimes fleſhy, and conſiſts of many bloody Veins.</p>
                  <p>This Diſeaſe ariſes from an Ulcer of the Fleſh in the Angle of the Eye, upon which account an inequality ariſes in the part, which in time grows to this covering.</p>
                  <p>It is difficultly cured; for the ſharp Medicines that are neceſſary for taking it off, muſt be uſed leaſurely and by degrees, by reaſon of the exquiſite Senſe of the Eye. When it is of a moderate bigneſs, it may be cured by Medicines; but when it hath extended it ſelf to the Black of the Eye and is become inverate, it can be cured only by manual Operation.</p>
                  <p>When it is thick and hard, and of a blackiſh Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, it is of a Cancerous Nature, and can never be cured.</p>
                  <p>The Cure muſt be directed to the antecedent, and conjunct Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the antecedent Cauſe, ſuch courſe of Diet muſt be ordered, as hath been propos'd for other Diſeaſes of the Eyes ariſing from Fluxion, Evacuations

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Juice of Fennel four ounces, of the Juice of Celandine three ounces, of the Juice of Rue two ounces, of the Juice of Mallows two ounces and an half, of Aloes one dram, of Vitriol two ſcruple, of Verdigreaſe one ſcruple, of Ginger and Cinnamon half a ſcruple, of the Gall of an Eele, of Ox Gall, or Hogs Gall two drams, of Sugar-Candy two ſcruples; boil the Juices, add the reſt and clarifie them, ſo make a Collyrium.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. XXXII. Of Deafneſs and Difficulty of Hearing.</head>
                  <p>WE treat of Deafneſs and Difficulty of Hearing in the ſame Chapter, becauſe they proceed from the ſame Cauſes, and differ only in degree.</p>
                  <p>They are either occaſioned by Diſeaſes of the Head, or by a fault in the Ears.</p>
                  <p>A Cold <hi>Intemperies</hi> of the Brain, repletion or weakneſs, or any other Diſorder, eſpecially in that Part from whence the Nerves of Hearing ariſe, may occaſion Deafneſs of Difficulty of Hearing. The fault of the Ear may be in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65404:43"/>
the inward or outward part of it. In the outward Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, a perfect or imperfect Stoppage, by reaſon of a Tumor, Abſceſs, Blood, Matter, Flegm, or other things from within, or without, may occaſion a difficulty of Hearing: But it is to be noted, that though the outward Cavity be quite ſtopped, yet perfect Deafneſs will not follow; for ſounds can paſs through the Mouth to the Ears: for there is an open Paſſage from the Pallate to the inward Cavity of the Ears, which ſerves for the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Ears, aad thoſe that are Deaf, are wont to open their Mouths, that they may hear the better: And if Travelling by Night, you put one end of your Stick, or the point of your Sword betwixt your Teeth, and the other end on the Ground, you will eaſier hear a noiſe from a far, and Footſteps of thoſe that follow you.</p>
                  <p>In the inward part of the Ear, Humours collected in the inward Cavity flowing principally from the Head, moſt commonly Flegmatick, but ſometimes Cholerick, occaſion Deafneſs, or Difficulty of Hearing: But theſe Humours are ſometimes tranſmitted to the Ears from the whole Body, as in continual Fevers, eſpecially when they are malignant; but it alſo proceeds from an ill Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Organs of Hearing, as when the Tympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num is relaxed by a violent noiſe, or from moiſture. And for this reaſon very many deaf People hear worſt in a Southerly Conſtitution, becauſe the Membrane is relaxed by the moiſture of the Air: But ſometimes the Tympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num is ſtretched and dried too much, as after acute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, Watching or Faſting, and ſometimes it is broke by violent Motions, or corroded by Matter: But ſometimes Matter and Blood flow from the Ear in great Concuſſions, without any injury to the Hearing, when they break out betwixt the Bone, and the Membrane; or if other Parts of the Ear are diſordered from the Birth, or by reaſon of ſome external Cauſe, as from a Fall, a Blow, or the like. Laſtly, a cold <hi>Intemperies</hi> occaſioned by cold Air, or cold Water falling into Ear, or the immoderate uſe of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks, or of other Medicines, may occaſion this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                  <p>To diſtinguiſh particularly all thoſe Cauſes by their Signs is very difficult, yet they may be gueſt at in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:65404:44"/>If Deafneſs happen by reaſon of a Diſeaſe in the Head<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſome other Senſes are alſo hurt, or ſome peculiar Diſeaſe appears in the Brain, as pain or dulneſs of the Head, Apoplexy, Lethargy or the like.</p>
                  <p>The Stoppage of the outward Cavities of the Ears may be perceived by the Eyes, if by the Sun you look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cavities; for then you may ſee, whether it be a Tumour or groſs Matter, or any other Heterogeneous Subſtance; and then you may know, by the relation of the Patient, whether any thing is fall'n into the Ear.</p>
                  <p>But if the inward Cavity be filled with ſome Humour, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe it is Flegm, if a Flegmatick Fluxion troubled the Sick before, or if he has been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubject to ſuch Fluxions.</p>
                  <p>But if a Cholerick Humour occaſions this Diſeaſe, a Cholerlck Fever afflicts the Sick, or went before, and it is alſo accompanied with violent Pain, if it proceed from Blood, the Pain is heavy, and Blood abounds in the whole Body.</p>
                  <p>The looſeneſs and moiſture of the Tympanum is known by moiſt Cauſes going before, and by a moiſt <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> ſeizing ſome other Part; for it can ſcarce be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that moiſture ſhould only ſeize this part. Too much drineſs or tenſity of Tympanum may be known by the drineſs of the whole Body, and drying Cauſes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo gueſs at the Rupture or Erroſion of the Drum, if the violent corroding and tearing Cauſes above-mentioned went before.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſticks of this Diſeaſe. Deafneſs from the Birth, or which has continu'd a long while, and is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, is incurable. And that which is not abſolute, but of a long ſtanding, is ſeldom or never cured.</p>
                  <p>That Deafneſs which proceeds from Choler or Blood, in acute and continual Fevers, commonly goes off when the Fever ceaſes.</p>
                  <p>Difficulty of Hearing, if it be not ſoon cured, dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates into a perfect Deafneſs; if the Drum be broke, and if a Cicatrix be left upon it, the Deafneſs is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                  <p>That Deafneſs which encreaſes and decreaſes by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, is curable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:65404:44"/>As to the Cure: That Deafneſs which proceeds from a Diſeaſe of the Head, requires no other Cure than what is requiſite for the Cure of the ſaid Diſeaſe; that which ariſes from a Tumour that is hard and inveterate is incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: But if it be hot and inflamed, the Cure of it is propoſed in the Chapter of Pains of the Ears: But if it proceed from Matter collected in the Ear, ſee the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of the things that come preternaturally from the Ear. If it proceed from drineſs, it muſt be cured by a moiſtning Diet, by long Sleep, and by waſhing the Head with warm Water, and dropping moiſtning things into the Ear, as Oil of ſweet Almonds and the like: If it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any thing dropp'd into the Ear, that muſt be forthwith waſh'd out, ſhook out, or extracted; and if ſome little Animal has crept into the Ear, it muſt either be allur'd out, or kill'd. The Ears are waſh'd by pour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing in ſuch things as moiſten, ſmoothen and dilate them as Milk, Oil of ſweet Almonds, or ſome mollifying or looſning Decoction. Things are ſhook out of the Ears by Sneezing. It is alſo good in this caſe to bend the Ear downwards, and to hop upon the Leg of the ſame ſide; for by this means, Boys ſhake Water out of their Ears when they have been ſwimming. But if thoſe things do not ſucceed, you muſt endeavour to extract it by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully putting an Ear Pitcher beyond it, or with a pair of Forceps fitted for the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But if this does not ſucceed, you muſt endeavour to break them, and afterwards waſh them out; and to this purpoſe, a Probe with Cotton on the end of it, and dipp'd in Turpentine, or the like, is put into the Ear, to clear the Paſſage; and if any of the clammy Matter remains behind, it may be cleared by an Ear-Picker. Some cut a Quill, and put one end into the Ear, and endeavour to ſuck out what is in it.</p>
                  <p>Animals are allur'd out of the Ear, by putting ſuch things to it, as are pleaſing to them; as a Spunge dipp'd in Milk and Sugar, or the Pulp of a ſweet Apple, or Lard wherewith little Worms are much pleaſed, and ſoon come out of the Ear, if it be turned to the Sun. If a Leec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> happen to get into the Ears, it may be enticed out, by putting Blood to the Ear; Gnats may be drawn out, by putting Dogs Hairs into the Ears; but if you
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65404:45"/>
cann't get them out, alive, 'tis beſt to kill them, becauſe then they will not diſturb the Ear ſo much, and may be eaſier drawn out; they may be kill'd by dropping Spittle or Urine into the Ear. But bitter things kill them ſooneſt, as the Juice of Wormwood, a Decoction of Aloes, or any Gauls, ſharp things do alſo the ſame, as Vinegar, the Juice of Onions, and the like.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe a cold <hi>Intemperies</hi> is the moſt frequent cauſe of Deafneſs, rhe Cure muſt be chiefly directed to the amendment of it; wherefore an attenuating, drying, and moderately heating courſe of Diet being ordered, as is preſcribed for the <hi>Gutta Serena</hi>; and Southerly Winds being avoided as much as poſſible, and the Ears defended from them; Vaporous Aliments muſt be avoided, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Garlick and Onions, which are very injurious to the Hearing, and alſo thoſe that generate groſs and flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Humours; theſe things, I ſay being firſt obſerved, general Evacuation muſt be entered upon by Head Purges. Bleeding muſt be alſo uſed if there be an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for it; and if the Diſeaſe be obſtinate, a Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Diet, afterwards particular Remedies that cauſe a Revulſion of the Humours, as Bliſters, Iſſues, Sneeſing Powders, Maſticatories, Apophlegmatiſms, but eſpecially Maſticatories.</p>
                  <p>But Sulphureous and Bitumenous Baths are peculiarly proper for the Cure of this Diſeaſe, the Body being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and the Head waſhed with them; afterwards topical Remedies are to be applied, to diſcuſs the Matter in the Ear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves of wild Marjoram, Wormwood; Penny-royal, wild Thym, Sage, Mint, the leſſer Centaury, Mallows, Marſh-mallows each one handful, of the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Camomil, Melilot, Stechas, and Roſemary each one pugil, of Cinnamon and Cloves, each half an ounce; boil them in equal parts of Fountain-water and White Wine added towards the end. Strain it, and foment the Ear with it hot with a Spunge Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the Vapour of the Decoction may be received into the Ear through a Tunel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It certainly does much good by paſſing into the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Parts of the Ear. Inſtead of the Fomentation, Bread made up with Carraway-ſeeds, cut and applied hot

from the Oven, may be uſed; or common Bread juſt taken out of the Oven, the under Cruſt being cut off dipp'd in Spirit of Wine, and applied as hot to the Ear as can be born, is alſo of good uſe: But the Bread will be more effectual, if with the common Flower, the Seeds of Carraways, Juniperberries, Bayberries, and Nutmegs are mixed with it.</p>
                  <p>If you'll have a ſtronger Decoction, you may add of the Pulp of Coloquintida, or of the Roots of white Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore each one dram: After fomentation, ſome Liquor muſt be inſtilled into the Ear, and afterwards you may ſtop it with Cotton perfum'd with Musk.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXXIII. Of Noiſe in the Ears.</head>
                  <p>THE Senſe of Hearing is obſtructed by a Noiſe in the Ears; for as the Eye ought to be void of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that it may rightly perceive all the Colours of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: For if it be preternaturally affected with any Colour, as in the Jaundice, the Sight muſt be neceſſarily depraved, ſo the Ear ſhould have no ſound in it, that it be able to receive all Sounds that come from abroad, for if any Sound is preternaturally in the Ear, it hinders Hearing.</p>
                  <p>This Noiſe in the Ear proceeds from a preternatural Commotion of the inbred Air; for though this inbred Air moves naturally, yet no noiſe is heard from its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs we ſtop the Ear with the hand, or with ſome ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes of this extraordinary Motion are Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, Wind, or Spirits, tranſmitted to the Ear from other Parts, or bred in it; if it be brought from other Parts, it proceeds either from the whole Body, or ſome peculiar Part. It flows from the whole Body in Fevers, and this Sound in the Ear comes from a windy Spirit conveyed through the Arteries from the whole Body to the Ears: But it moſt frequently happens at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Fits, and juſt before a Criſis by a Bleeding at the Noſe. Wind is alſo elevated to the Ears, from ſome peculiar Part, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Stomach, Liver, Spleen, Meſentery, Womb, and from ſome other Parts; upon which account, inviolent Vomiting, Hypochondriack Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and Mother-Fits, there is frequently a Noiſe in the Ears. It is alſo occaſioned by windy Spirits flowing from the Head, that ariſe from Cold and Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Humours. Wind is alſo generated in the Ear by Flegmatick Matter contain'd there. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, difficulty of Hearing is commonly accompanied with a Noiſe in the Ear, for the Obſtruction is occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Humours, Other Cauſes occaſioning this Noiſe in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65404:46"/>
the Ears, are Ulcers, a hot Intemperies, Weakneſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Senſe, a violent ſhaking in the Head, and violent Sounds.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is to be varied, according to the variety of the Cauſes; and firſt the Cure of the Noiſe proceeding from a conſent of other Parts, depends on the Cure of the Diſeaſes of thoſe Parts: But that which ariſes immediately from the Ear requires a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Cure; and if it be generated by a cold Intemperies, and from groſs Wind, it requires the ſame Cure which is deſcribed in the Chapter above. If it proceed from an Ulcer in the Ears, it requires the ſame Cure, which is propoſed for Curing the Ulcer in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If it proceed from Weakneſs, after long Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it will decreaſe gradually as the Strength increaſes. But you muſt drop into the Ear Oil of Camomil, of Dill, or Oil of ſweet Almonds. And laſtly, if it takes its riſe from a hot Intemperies, or an exquiſite Senſe, a cooling and moiſtning Diet muſt be ordered, and cooling things muſt be dropp'd into the Ear, and firſt a Decoction of Barly, Violets, Lettice, Water Lilies, to which may be added, to make it more penetrating a little Balm or Camomil; and if theſe do no good, the Juice of Lettice, Purſlane, and Henbane may be uſed. <hi>Galen</hi> propoſes the Juice of Poppies, and Opium it ſelf; but theſe are to be uſed ſparingly, leaſt by weakning the Native Heat of the Part, they ſhould too much dull the Hearing.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXXIV. Of Pain of the Ears.</head>
                  <p>PAIN of the Ears is a very violent Diſeaſe. The chief Cauſes of it are Intemperies immaterial and humoral, Wounds, Ulcers, and external Things falling or thruſt into the Cavity of the Ear.</p>
                  <p>A cold Intemperies often occaſions a Pain in the Ears; it is occaſioned by cold Winds, cold Water, and other
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65404:47"/>
cold thlngs; for cold things are injurious to thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous and nervous Parts.</p>
                  <p>But a cold Matter occaſioning Pains in the Ears, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Flegmatick, or Serous flowing from the Brain, or Wind tranſmitted from the Brain, or lower Parts.</p>
                  <p>Hot Matter occaſioning thoſe Pains is either Cholerick, or Sanguinious, whereby an Inflammation is raiſed.</p>
                  <p>If an immaterial Intemperies be the Cauſe, there is no weight peceived in the Ear, nor no Tumour. A cold Intemperies is known by cold Cauſes going before, as tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in the Winter time, the increaſe of Pain by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cold, and its being eaſed by the Application of hot things. A hot Intemperies may be known, by the external things that heat, as a hot Air, the heat of the Sun, pain ariſing from the uſe of hot things.</p>
                  <p>If the pain ariſe from a Flegmatick Humour, there is a weight perceived in the Ear and in the Head, and a Flegmatick Fluxion has ſometimes fallen upon ſome other Parts. Beſides, cold Cauſes went before, as cold and a Northerly Wind, cold Aliments, Winter time, old Age and the like.</p>
                  <p>If the Pain ariſe from Wind, it will be violent, but not continual, and a noiſe of the Ear will be joined with it.</p>
                  <p>That it comes from a Serous Humour, may be known by other Diſeaſes produced by it, and afflicting the Sick at the ſame time, as ſharp and thin Fluxions on the Teeth, the Eyes, the Ears, the Breaſt, and other Parts, and by an Evacuation of ſerous Humour by Vomit, Stool, Urine and Sweat.</p>
                  <p>If it ariſes from a Cholerick Humour, it will be prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſharp, with a ſenſe of heat; it will be eaſed by cooling Medicines, and the Conſtitution is hot and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, the Sick young, the Courſe of Diet hot, it is Summer, and ſome other heating Cauſes went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>An Inflammation is known by the Violence of the Pain, Pulſation, by great heat and redneſs, that extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſometimes to the Cheeks and Temples; a violent continual Fever accompanies it, ſometimes a Delirium, Convulſion, Fainting, and Coldneſs of the extream Parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:65404:47"/>A Wound may be known by Blood pouring from the Ear, an Ulcer by Matter flowing out: But becauſe a Flux of Matter ſometimes flows from the Brain through the Ears, there is need of diſtinction; for if it proceed from the Brain, the Pain of the Head, and other Signs of an Impoſthume went before, the Matter is evacuated in great quantity, and is leſſen'd by degrees, till at length it quite ceaſes. But it may proceed indeed in a great quantity from an Abſceſs of the Ear; but then the Signs of an Inflammation went before, afterwards an Ulcer follows, which afterwards may be known by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Signs, whether it takes its riſe from an Abſceſs, or from a Flux of ſome ſharp Humour, A ſmall quantity of Matter flows continually, pain and heat, and pricking in the Ear, eſpecially when the Ear-Picker is put in. Moreover, we may gueſs at the differences of the Ulcer; for if the Ulcer actually exiſts, it may be known by the thin Sanies, that is of a Citron Colour: And by the length of the Diſeaſe, you may know if it be deep by the quantity of Matter; if it be ſordid, by the thickneſs and quantity of it; if it be virulent, by the thin Sanies; if putrid, by the ſtinking Matter; if corroſive, by Blood flowing out after the Sanies; if it be Fiſtulous, by the duration of the Ulcer, the virulent Sanies, and by the hard and callous Fleſh. Things fallen into the Ear, or thruſt into it, may be known by the relation of the Sick, and may be perceived in the Cavity of it.</p>
                  <p>The Prognoſtick of the Pain of the Ear is various, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety of the Cauſes; that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds only from an Intemperies, is eaſily cured. That which proceeds from cold, flegmatick, ſerous, or windy Matter, is not dangerous, but is moſt commonly long in curing: But that which proceeds from hot Humours, and eſpecially if they cauſe an Inflammation, is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for the Brain, by reaſon of its nearneſs, ſuffers by conſent, and a Delirium and a Convulſion often follow; and young Men are in moſt danger of this Diſeaſe; for they being of a hot Conſtitution, and their Blood being hot, the Inflammation is ſo great, that it deſtroys the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Heat of the Brain, and kills the Sick within a Week; but old Mens Humours are colder, and the Inflammation leſs, and ſo they are leſs in danger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:65404:48"/>Ulcers in the Ears are difficultly cured, becauſe the Brain puts off its Excrements upon them, but thoſe that follow an Abſceſs are eaſier cur'd, and alſo thoſe that yield good Matter: But when the Sanies is virulent, fetid, or otherwiſe ill qualified, the Cure will be very difficult, and eſpecially if the Ulcer be Fiſtulous, or the Bone foul.</p>
                  <p>The Cure muſt be varied according to the variety of the Cauſes, if it proceed from a cold Intemperies alone, bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>For the Cure of an Inflammation of the Ear, an emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient, cooling, and looſning Cliſter muſt be injected, and ſo much Blood muſt be taken away, as may anſwer to the fulneſs of it, and to make a ſufficient Revulſion of the Humour flowing to the affected Ear, the Cephalick Vein oppoſite to it muſt be opened, and a great quantity of Blood muſt be taken away at ſeveral times; and if the Diſeaſe ſeem to ariſe from a Suppreſſion of the Courſes, or of the Hemorrhoids, the inferior Veins muſt be opened, a good quantity of Blood being firſt taken from the Arm. And if thoſe Cauſes are abſent, the opening of the inferior Veins will make an excellent Revulſion to the moſt diſtant Parts, to which end Leeches applied to the <hi>Anus</hi> are alſo proper.</p>
                  <p>Revulſions may be alſo commodiouſly made by Frictions, and Ligatures of the Arms and Legs, and by Cupping-glaſſes applied to the Shoulders and Back.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:65404:48"/>And ſometimes Cupping-glaſſes applied behind the Ears for to make Derivation, do much good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> alſo commends Leeches applied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Ears, four of a ſide, which he ſays, gave much relief to a certain young Man, who was afflicted with a violent Inflammation of the Ear: The opening of the Artery of the Temples has alſo ſometimes admirable Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Purging is alſo very proper in this Diſeaſe, with Cholagoges; afterwards the whole Maſs of the Humours is to be attemperated with cooling Juleps made of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Lettice, Purſlain, Plantane, Sorrel, and the like, alſo of the Syrups of Lemons, Pomegranates, and of red Poppies.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, whilſt the foreſaid Remedies are uſed, Topicks are to be continually applied, which muſt be always anodyn, by reaſon of the Violence of the Pain, the Mitigation whereof is principally to be taken care of; but at the beginning and increaſe, gentle Repellents are to be mixed with the anodyns; at the State and Declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reſolvents are to be mixed with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Womans Milk, freſh drawn, two ounces; of the white of an Egg beat to a Liquor half an ounce; mix them, and drop it warm into the Ear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or the Milk alone milk'd into the Ear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the leaves of Plantane, and Night-ſhade, each one handful; of the flowers of Camomil and Melilot, each one Pugil; make a Decoction; let the Vapour be received into the Ear by a Tunnel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oyls of Violets, Water-Lillies and Roſes, each one Ounce, mingle them, drop it warm into the Ear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Millepedes infuſed in the foreſaid Oyles, and preſs'd out, make an excellent Anodyn; for they have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Faculty to eaſe Pain, and for that reaſon they are uſed for Pains of the Teeth, the Piles, and other Pains.</p>
                  <p>If the Heat is very violent, cooling Juices are to be mixed with the foreſaid Oyls in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oyl of Water-Lillies, and Oyl of Roſes, each one ounce, of the Juice of Night-ſhade and Plantane, each half an ounce, mingle them, and drop it into the Ear.</hi>

may be ſuſpected as may be alſo all other things which repel powerfully, for there is danger, leaſt the Humour ſhould flow back upon the Brain; and it is a general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept always to be obſerved, not to apply ſtrong Repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents in Inflammations that are near noble parts; but gentle Repellents may be mixed with Looſening and Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyn things; for ſo the Fluxion may be moderately ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and not driven far back.</p>
                  <p>But in violent Pains we are forced to uſe Narcoticks, but they muſt be uſed rarely, and with great caution, for they are offenſive to the Head. I know a Perſon, ſays <hi>Galen,</hi> who loſt his Speech and Senſe by the uſe of Opium, nor could he be reſtored by any Medicines: But if there be abſolute Neceſſity, they may be preſcribed in the following manner.</p>

                  <p>In the Application of Topicks the Precept of <hi>Galen</hi> muſt be carefully obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> That the inflamed Ear be not touched, but Medicines muſt be dropt into the Ear by a Probe wrapt round with the ſofteſt Wool dipt in the Medicines, and the Sick muſt be ask'd whether it be warm, and whether he can bear it any hotter, and you muſt drop it in as hot as he can bear it; the Probe muſt be dipt in the Medicine and applied gently to the paſſage of the Ear, that it may flow into it; you muſt continue doing of it till the paſſage is full, and then apply over it to the mouth of the paſſage and over all the Ear, Wool dipt in the Medicine.</p>
                  <p>At the ſtate of the Diſeaſe, Oyls gently reſolving are to be mixed with Anodyns in the following manner.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Water drawn from Aſh-ſticks, being dropt into the Ear eaſes the pain wonderfully; it is drawn by burning green ſticks in the Fire, it drops from the ends of them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Crums of white Bread one pound, boil them in Milk to the conſiſtence of a Poultis; then add the yolks of Eggs number two, of Oyl of Roſes two ounces, of Saffron one ſcruple, make a Cataplaſm.</hi> Or,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>When the Abſceſs is broken, and the Matter comes out through the Membrane of the Ear, either rarified or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded; then the Sick ſhould lye on the Ear affected, that the Matter may flow out eaſily, and ſuch things ſhould be dropt into the Ear, as may waſh and cleanſe it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Decoction of Barly four ounces, of Honey of Roſes one ounce, mingle them, drop it warm into the Ear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Ulcer be generated by Acrimony of Matter, it requires a peculiar Cure, which may alſo be uſed for an Ulcer ariſing from Fluxion of Humours.</p>

                  <p>The Ulcer being well cleanſed it muſt be cicatrized by Epulotick Medicines uſed in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of round Birthwort, of the bark of Pomegranates, and of Galls, each half an ounce, boil them in equal parts of Wine and Smith's-water to half a pint; ſtrain it, and add to it of the Juice of Plantane and Knot-graſs, each one ounce, of Honey of Roſes two drams; mingle them, and drop it into the Ear; or drop into the Ear burnt Allum mixed with the Wine, for it is very drying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Ulcer be very obſtinate, and has continued a long while, it is certainly promoted by Fluxion, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt endeavour to remove, by Purging and a Diet-drink of Gujacum or Sarſaparilla, by Errhins, Maſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, Iſſues, and by other Remedies that divert the Fluxion.</p>
                  <p>If Pain ariſe by reaſon of the Sharpneſs of the Remedies, Oyl of Sweet or Bitter Almonds, with Myrrh, Aloes and Saffron, muſt be dropt into the Ear: If the Pain be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, a little Opium muſt be mixed with them, or the Oyl of the Yolks of Eggs beat in a leaden Mortar may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65404:50"/>If the Ulcer be very Sordid, Aegyptiacum muſt be mixed with the foreſaid Juices.</p>
                  <p>If the Pain of the Ear be occaſioned by ſomething thruſt into the Ear, you muſt endeavour to draw it out, by wrapping Wool upon a Probe dipt in Turpentine, or made glutinous by Roſin, or ſome other Gum: But if this will not do, warm Oyl muſt be often dropt into the Ear, to relax it, and to Lubricate the Matter contained in it, and ſo it may the eaſier be drawn out, and Sneeſing-powder muſt be given, and theſe things muſt be uſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually till the Sick is freed; for if any thing remain long in the Ear, an Inflammation will ariſe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it will be much more difficult to extract any thing from the Ear; and there will be beſides great danger.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If the foreſaid Remedies are not ſufficient, Chirurgical Inſtruments muſt be uſed. See the manner of Extraction in <hi>Fabritius Hildanus,</hi> Cen. I. Obſerv. 4, 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Gnats ſometimes inſinuate themſelves into the Ears, and moving in the Cavity of it, they cauſe much Trouble, but they may be extracted by a Probe wrapped round with Cotten, and dipt in Turpentine.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes water runs into the Ear in ſwimming, or when the Head is waſh'd, and is often very troubleſom and cauſes Pain, but is moſt commonly eaſily ſhook our, by hopping upon the Leg of the ſame ſide, and by holding the Ear downwards: But if this will not do, you muſt endeavour to ſuck it out with a Pipe wrapt round with Wool to ſtop the hole of the Ear, that the external Air ſhould not enter in. It is alſo dried by a ſmall ſoft piece of Spunge often put in.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXXV. Of things that come out Preternaturally from the Cavities of the Ears.</head>
                  <p>MAny Things come out preternaturally from the Ears, which muſt be particularly mentioned, and peculiar Remedies muſt be preſcribed for them. Firſt therefore, an Abſceſs being broken ariſing from an Inflammation, or from an Ulcer, proceeding from the Acrimony of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, Matter or Sanies, is wont to flow; the Cure of which depends on the Cure of the forementioned Diſeaſes, which are propoſed in the foregoing Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Blood alſo ſometimes flows from the Ears, as in Wounds and Concuſſions of the Head, whereby the Veins of the Ears may be broken or torn: But if this Flux be moderate, it muſt be left to it ſelf, for if it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained within it might cauſe an Inflammation; but if it be immoderate, or continue a long while, it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by bleeding in the Arm, and by applying Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glaſſes with Scarification to the Shoulders; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cooling and aſtringent things muſt be dropt into the Ears, as the Juice of Plantane, Knot-graſs, or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Bramble-tops, red Roſes, Maſtich, Acacia, Hypoſiſtis, Balauſtins, Sumach, and the like, in Wine and Vinegar, or Smiths Water.</p>
                  <p>A watry Humour ſometimes flows from the Brain to the Ears, this moſt commonly happens to Children, and ought not to be ſtop'd, for being ſuddenly ſtop'd, it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the Falling-ſickneſs, or ſome other great Diſeaſe of the Head.</p>
                  <p>For Nature puts off Excrements, and the too great Moiſture that abounds in Childrens Heads, not only by the ordinary ways appointed for this uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils and Pallate, but alſo through the Eyes, the Ears, and the Superficies of the Head, where Ulcers and Scabs often happen: But when ſuch an Evacuation is Symptomatick, and when the Humour flowing to the Ears cauſes Ulcers in them, and hinders the Hearing, you muſt endeavour
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65404:51"/>
to cure it by a convenient Method. And Firſt, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Humours in the Brain muſt be evacuated by gentle Purges often repeated, and alſo by Derivation, by Bliſters in the Neck, and an Iſſue there; afterwards the Ears muſt be cleanſed and dried by the following Medicine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Juice of Agrimony, and Worm-wood, each four Ounces, of Whitewine, and Honey of Roſes, each one Ounce, boil them a little, and drop them into the Ear the Filth being cleanſed away, afterwards the Ears muſt be ſtopped with Cotton dipt in the ſame Liquor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if a watry Humour flows from the Ears of grown People and continues ſo a long while; the whole Body and the Brain muſt be evacuated, afterwards, the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Moiſture muſt be dried up by Sudorifick Diet-drinks, and the Courſe of it muſt be endeavoured to be turned by Bliſters, Iſſues, and Cupping-glaſſes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Worms are ſometimes generated in the Ears, from putrid Ulcers, which being cured they ceaſe to come out. But Becauſe the healing of the Ulcer requires Time you may endeavour to kill the Worms in the mean while by convenient Remedies. For Inſtance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Oyl of bitter Almonds, of the Juice of Smallage, and the leſſer Centaury, each two Ounces, of Vinegar two Drams; boil them a little, then add of Mirrh, and Aloes, each one Scruple; mingle them, and drop it into the Ear.

                  </head>
                  <p>AN Ulcer of the Noſtrils is either freſh and ſimple, or old and putrid, which is called an Ozaena.</p>
                  <p>The freſh and ſimple proceeds either from extetnal Cauſes; as a Wound or Contuſion, or from internal, <hi>viz.</hi> From Acrimony of Humours flowing thither, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from Salt Flegm.</p>
                  <p>But an Ozaena comes from a ſimple Ulcer neglected, or by reaſon of greater Acrimony of Humours.</p>
                  <p>A ſimple Ulcer hath little or no Pain; and Blood flows frequently from it, eſpecially when it is touched or rubd, or it is covered with a dry and black Scab, which is ſometimes blown out; but an Ozaena is accompanied with a greater Pain, the Scab is more filthy, and the Snot ſtinks, and it often eats the Back Bones, and perforates the Pallat, eſpecially if it be of a cancerous Nature, or from the French Pox, or an Elephantiaſis.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, ſuch a Courſe of Diet muſt be ordered as may attemperate the Acrimony of the Humours, and hinder its Generation; afterwards the whole Body muſt be evacuated by Bleeding and proper Purges; and Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſes muſt be applyed with Scarification. And if the Fluxion of ſharp Humours to the Noſtrils be very obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Derivation muſt be made by Bliſters in the Neck, and Iſſues there, and things that ſtrengthen the Head muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>After univerſal Remedies, Topicks muſt be applyed, and firſt you muſt ſee whither the Ulcers are cruſty, if they are, the Scabs muſt be taken off before you go any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65404:52"/>
farther; and firſt you muſt foment them with warm Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or anoint them with freſh Butter, with freſh Gooſe or Hens Greaſe, or with rhe Oyl of ſweet Almonds, or the like.</p>
                  <p>When you have mollified them, they muſt not be forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pulled off, but you muſt ſuffer them to fall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or gently remove them with your Finger, anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Oyl of Almonds.</p>
                  <p>When the Scabs are cleared, you muſt uſe drying and aſtringent Medicines; in a ſimple Ulcer it may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to waſh it with Barly-water ſweetned with Honey of Roſes, and to anoint it, with Oyntment of Tutty, or with the white Oyntment of Rhaſis, or with the Oyl of the Yolks of Eggs rub'd in a leaden Mortar.</p>
                  <p>But for an Ozaena you muſt prepare the following Medicines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of whole Barley one Pugil, of the Leaves of Agrimony, Plantane, Wormwood, and the leſſer Centaury, one Handful; of red Roſes half a Pugil; boil them in Smiths Water, in the Liquor ſtrained diſſolve four Ounces of Honey of Roſes, make an Errhine, which muſt be often ſnuffed up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After it hath been cleanſed, the following Decoction muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Balauſtins, and Pomegranate-peel, each two Ounces, of the Leaves of Plantane, Horſe-tail, Mouſe-ear, Rupture-wort, each one Handful, of the Roots of Biſtort one Ounce, of Crude-alum, one Ounce and an half; make a Decoction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Water of Allum is alſo very good, and alſo thoſe Medicines which are to be propoſed to dry a Polypus in the following Chapter. Egyptiacum alſo diſſolved in Barly-water is good.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards uſe the following Oyntment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Omphacine Oyl half an Ounce, of Pomegranate-Bark and Balauſtines, each three Drams; of Mirrh, Allum, and Labdanum, each two Drams; of Chalcitis,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65404:53"/>
Aloes, and the Bark of Frankincenſe, each one Dram; of the Oyl of Roſes, and Mirtles, each two Ounces, of red Wax, a ſufficient Quantity to make an Oyntment; apply it to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer, or diſſolve it in Wine, or Plantane-water, ſnuff it up often, the Mouth being filled with Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Ulcer is well cleanſed, you muſt dry it with the Powder of red Roſes ſnuft up. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> ſays, that nothing is ſo effectual to dry the Ulcers as Fumes of Orpiment and Cinnabar: As for Inſtance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Pure Labdanum, of Hypociſtis, Maſtich, and Mirrh, each three Drams; red Storax, and Storax calamit, of the Bark of Frankincenſe, Sandarach, and Orpiment, each two Drams; mix them all with Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, and make Troches, wherewith let the Sick be fumed, Morning and Evening in his Chamber.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is alſo of great Uſe to burn Candles made of red Wax in the Patient's Chamber, which ought to be ſmall, and the Windows and Doors muſt be kept cloſe ſhut. And this Way, ſays <hi>Rondeletius,</hi> I have cured Ulcers which the Italian and French Phyſicians left off as incurable.</p>

                  <p>UPon Ulcers of the Noſe comes ſometimes fleſhy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences which conſtitute another Kind of Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> A preternatural Tumour, whereof there are two Sorts, one a Sarcoma, and the other a Polypus.</p>
                  <p>A Sarcoma is a fleſhy Excreſcence in the Noſe, which has no certain Shape, and is much like proud Fleſh in other Ulcers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But a Polypus is a fleſhy Excreſcence ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with ſmall Roots, and afterwards ſpreads broad and hangs down in the Noſe, and reſembles the Fiſh Polypus, from whence it takes its Name. It is a ſoft Caruncle,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65404:53"/>
ſometimes white ſometimes red, and ſometimes livid; and if it grow much, it ſometimes hangs out of the Noſtrils: But if it be rooted high in the Noſe, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hangs down to the Pallat, and obſtructs the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Paſſage of the Mouth, and it may be plainly ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Uva: It ſwells much in a ſoutherly Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and at full Moon, and is much diminiſhed at the new Moon: It may be diſtinguiſhed from a Sarcoma, becauſe a Sarcoma, is wont to grow at the Bottom of the Noſtrils, but a Polypus near the Root of the Noſe.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſe of both Tumours is a thick viſcid and flegmatick Humour flowing from the Brain mixed with ſome Blood, and ſometimes a melancholly Humour is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and then there is Danger leſt it degenerate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Cancer. A Sarcoma is alſo generated often from a ſuperfluous Nutriment of the Noſtrils.</p>
                  <p>A Sarcoma is moſt commonly eaſily cured, but a Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus very difficultly: But that which is ſoft, and white or red, or rediſh, is cured moſt eaſily; but when it is hard and livid it is very hardly cured; and there is Danger leaſt it ſhould turn to a Cancer. That which is ſeated below or in the Middle of the Noſtrils, is eaſier cured than that which grows at the Root of the Noſe, becauſe Medicines can ſcarce reach thither.</p>
                  <p>Both of them are to be cured the ſame Way, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſuperfluous Fleſh muſt be taken off: But firſt the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Cauſe muſt be removed, which is a Flegmatick Humour falling from the Head. To this End an atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating Courſe of Diet muſt be ordered, and univerſal Evacuations, Revulſion and Derivation. Afterwards the ſuperfluous Fleſh muſt be taken off, either by a cauſtick or by an Inſtrument, and the Ulcer remaining muſt be cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trized: But at the Beginning, when the Diſeaſe is freſh, it is ſometimes cured by aſtringent and very drying Medicines, and ſuch gentle Means are always to be uſed before you proceed to greater.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of unripe Grapes three Pounds, of the Bark of Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granate, of Balauſtins, and Sumach, each two Pounds; infuſe them in Vinegar, and diſtil them; then add of Allum a Pound, of Vitriol three Ounces; diſtil them all again, and touch the inward parts of the Noſtrils fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with the Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:65404:54"/>If this is not ſufficient more powerful things muſt be uſed, and you muſt add Sandarach, and Orpiment to the foregoing Water; or the Polypus muſt be frequently touched with Spirit of Vitriol tempered with Plantane Water: But red Precipitat often waſhed is reckoned the beſt Medicine. It may be mixt with Honey of Roſes, and applyed with a Tent dipt in it. Plaiſters are alſo uſed in this Caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Verdigreaſe, Orpiment, Vitriol, Crude-alum, each one Ounce and an half, of Antimony ſix Drams; infuſe them in Vinegar, and then powder them very fine; when they are dry, infuſe them and powder them eight Times more; then laſtly infuſe them in Plantane Water, and dry them; afterwards take of Oyl of Roſes four Ounces, of Thithargo two ounces, mix them and boyl them; and towards the End, two Ounces of the foreſaid Powder, boyl it to a ſticking Plaiſter, and make Tents of it to be put up the Noſtrils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note,</hi> That before the Uſe of Cauſticks, the Noſtrils muſt be defended by <hi>Galen</hi>'s cooling Oyntment, or with Populeum, or with the White of an Egg mixt with the Oyl of Roſes, or the like. Secondly, you muſt take Notice, that cauſtick Medicines muſt be conveyed through a Silver Pipe, which muſt incompaſs the Polypus ſo that the Medicine may work and not touch the Noſtrils. Thirdly, you muſt take Notice, that ſuch Medicines muſt be uſed when the Moon is waneing, for then the Tumour is much diminiſhed, and ſo the Medicine may the eaſier reach the Root of it. Laſtly, if it cannot be cured by Medicines, you muſt proceed to Chirurgical Operation, which is deſcribed by <hi>Cornelius Celſus</hi> and by late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXXVIII. Of the Loſs of Smelling, and other Faults of it.</head>
                  <p>SMelling, as all the other Actions of the Body is hurt three Ways, it is either diminiſhed, aboliſhed, or depraved.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſe of Smelling diminiſhed and aboliſhed are the ſame, they only differ in Degree; they are Intemperies, Obſtruction and Compreſſion.</p>
                  <p>A cold and moiſt intemperies, joyned with Flegmatick Matter, leſſens Smelling, or quite aboliſhes it; upon which Account in a Catarrh and Coryza, the Senſe of Smelling is frequently leſſened, or wholly deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Obſtruction is occaſioned by a Flegmatick Humour, which ſtops the Paſſages of the Noſtrils, and the Pores of the Mamillary Proceſſes, ſo that Smells cannot come to them; it may alſo be occaſioned by a Sarcoma, Polypus, or any thing elſe that ſtops the Paſſages of the Noſtrils.</p>
                  <p>A Compreſſion alſo ſometimes may happen from a Flegmatick Humour collected in the fore part of the Brain, compreſſing the Mamillary Proceſſes, as happens in Diminution of the Sight by compreſſing of the Optick Nerves. It alſo may happen from a natural Defect in the Confirmation of the Noſtrils, as when the Noſtrils are ſo narrow and low that there is not a free Paſſage.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſe of depraved ſmelling, is a bad Savour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſtriking upon the Noſtrils, which either proceeds from an Ulcer of the Noſtrils, or from putrid Flegm gathered together about the Noſtrils or the Os Ethmoides: For that Flegm that putrifies in the Senſe of Smelling, or near it, betwixt the Coats of the Brain, does not affect the Senſe it ſelf, nor thoſe that labour under it; but any one that ſits near them will eaſily find it out, for nothing can be ſmelt but what is carried to the Senſe from ſome other Place. A naſty and ſtinking Vapour may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Proceſſus, Mamillares from other Parts, as from the Stomach, Gums, and the Brain it ſelf, that ſpoil the Senſe of Smelling, ſo that all Savours are thought to be
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65404:55"/>
ſuch; even as the Tongue being diſordered by bitter Choler, taſts all things bitter.</p>
                  <p>Any of theſe Cauſes are eaſily known, a cold Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries and Abundance of Flegm are known by a cold and moiſt Intemperies of the Brain, and a ſlimy Flegm dropping from the Head.</p>
                  <p>An Obſtruction, if it be occaſioned by Flegm, is known by the ſame Signs. If it proceeds from a Sarcoma, or a Polypus, the Diagnoſtick is to be taken from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Chapters.</p>
                  <p>The Place wherein the Matter cauſing the Obſtruction reſides, is known from this, If it ſticks in the Paſſages of the Noſtrils, there is a Defect of the Speech, becauſe the Noſtrils do greatly contribute to the forming of Words.</p>
                  <p>But if the Matter ſtick in the fore part of the Brain, or the Mamillary Paſſages, the Speech will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <p>You may know by the peculiar Diſeaſes of each Part, from whence the ill Scent ariſes that offends the Organ of Smelling.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick Smelling, if it be lately loſt, or if it ariſes from a ſimple Coriza, may be eaſily cured.</p>
                  <p>The cure muſt be varied according to the Variety of the Cauſes, if it ariſe from a cold Intemperies, thoſe things are proper which are uſed for a cold Catarrh: But to open an Obſtruction occaſioned by Flegm thruſt into the Paſſages of the Noſtrils, or into the Mamillary Proceſſes, ſuch Remedies are to be uſed as purge thoſe Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Errhins, Sneazing-Powders, and Apopleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If the Noſtrils are obſtructed by a Sarcoma, or Polypus, it muſt be cured by the removing of them.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XXXIX. Of an ill Scent in the Noſtrils.</head>
                  <p>AN ill Scent in the Noſtrils and a ſtinking Breath, are very different, for that comes wholly from the Noſtrils, but this from various Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> From the Stomach, Lungs, Gums, or from Ulcers in the Jaws, which are either apparent to Senſe, or may be known by their proper Signs,</p>
                  <p>But an ill Scent in the Noſe, is occaſioned by putrid Vapours, ariſing either from the Noſtrils, as in an Ozena, a Sarcoma, or Polypus, or from Air tranſmitted to the Noſtrils from putrid Humours contained in the Brain, and in rhe fore Part of it, or about the Mamillary Proceſſes, or Os Cribraſum: But Flegmatick Humours putrifie in the ſaid Parts when they are retained in them beyond Meaſure, eſpecially if there be alſo a hot and moiſt Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries of the Brain, they are retained by reaſon of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thoſe Parts, or too great an Oppreſſion of them, as in thoſe that are flat-noſed.</p>
                  <p>The Diſeaſe of the Noſe occaſioning ſuch a Stink, may be known by its proper Signs. But if there be no ſuch Diſeaſe in the Noſtrils, we may conjecture that it ariſes from a putrid Humour contained in the Brain, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millary Proceſſes, or in the Os cribroſum.</p>
                  <p>The Prognoſtick of an ill Scent in the Noſtrils, which is occaſioned by an Ulcer, Polypus or Sarcoma, depends on the Prognoſtick of them; But that ill Scent which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Corrupt Humours contained in the fore part of the Head, if it be lately come may be eaſily cured, if it be inveterate, it is incureable, eſpecially if it come from an ill Confirmation of the Noſtrils, as in ſuch as are flat-Noſed.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is performed by taking away the Cauſes, and by moderating the Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of an Ulcer, Sarcoma and Polypus, are mentioned above, but a putrid Humour contained in the Brain. Mamillary Proceſſes, or in the Os Ethmoides, muſt be carried off by Purging and Cleanſing.</p>

                  <p>BLeeding at the Noſe comes at any Time of the Year, and ſeiſes chiefly thoſe that are of a weakly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and have hot Blood, and oftner when they are in Years, than when they are Young; at firſt there are ſome Signs of a Feaver, which goes off by bleeding at the Noſe, but a Pain and a Heat in the fore part of the Head remains; the Blood flows for ſome Hours, then ſtops a while, and afterwards breaks out again, and ſo it does by turns, till at length it is quite ſtop'd, either by the uſe of Remedies, or of its own accord, by reaſon the Quantity is diminiſhed; but the Sick is in danger of a Relapſe yearly, either upon drinking of Spirituous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, or from being over-heated upon any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
                  <p>In order to the Cure, I endeavour to qualifie the Head and Ebullition of the Blood, upon which account the preternatural Extravaſation ariſes. Wherefore I bleed often in the Arm, and take away a large Quantity of Blood; I order a cooling and thickning Courſe of Diet, as three parts of Fountain Water, and one of Milk boil'd together, and drank cold, roaſted Apples, Barly-broths, and the like; forbidding the uſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As to External Applications, Rags four times doubled, and dipt in cold Water, wherein Sal Prunella has been diſſolved, and gently preſs'd out, may be applied often in a day to the Neck; and after general Evacuations the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Liquor may be applied.</p>

                  <p>A Spitting of Blood, which I ſhall now treat of, ſeiſes Weakly People of a hot Conſtitution, whoſe Lungs are weak; it happens chiefly to young People in the Spring or Summer-time.</p>

                  <p>AS all parts of the Body, eſpecially ſuch as are fleſhy, are wont to be inflamed, ſo alſo is the Tongue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, by reaſon of Blood flowing into it; and as it is Pure, Cholerick, Flegmatick or Melancholly, it occaſions either a Flegmon, or an Eryſipelas, an Oedema, or a Scirrhus, and ſometimes it ends in Suppuration; whereof <hi>Foreſtus</hi> mentions an Obſervation, of a Brewer who had a great Inflammation of the Tongue, which Suppurated.</p>
                  <p>But moſt commonly the Swelling of the Tongue is ſoft and looſe, and purely Oedematous, of which <hi>Galen</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes an Example, of a Man whoſe Tongue was ſo tumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that it could not be contained in his Mouth.</p>
                  <p>And ſometimes alſo the Tongue grows exceſſively big, when there is no Oedema, no Scirrhus, nor any other kind of Tumour, and without any kind of Pain, and is only an increaſe proceeding from too great Nouriſhment of the part.</p>
                  <p>The Diagnoſtick of theſe Tumours is not difficult, for they may be ſeen; but the differences of them may be ſo diſtinguiſh'd, if there be an Inflammation, Pain and Heat, and Redneſs attend it, and the Face is alſo affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; but if the Swelling proceed from Flegm, the Tongue is white, and much Flegm flows out, which taſts ſweet and inſipid: But if it be only an increaſe of the Tongue, there are no ſigns of other Tumours or ill Humours.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick; Tumours of the Tongue, for the moſt part, do not endanger Life, unleſs they grow ſo
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65404:59"/>
great, that Suffocation ſhould be feared from thence, or take their riſe from ſome Malignant Humour, which may generate a Cancer, which is known by Hardneſs, pricking Pain, and a livid Colour.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of an Inflammation of the Tongue, muſt be begun with ſuch things as cauſe a Revulſion, and with repelling Medicines: And then firſt a looſening Gliſter muſt be injected, and a large quantity of Blood muſt be taken away; preſently after Cupping-glaſſes with Scarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication muſt be applied to the Shoulders; afterwards cooling and repelling Gargariſms muſt be uſed. <hi>Galen</hi> commends the Juice of Lettice wherewith the Tongue muſt be waſhed; or a Gargariſm may be prepared, of a Decoction of Plantane, Nightſhade, of Syrup of dried Roſes.</p>
                  <p>After Bleeding Purging may be preſcribed, with a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine made of Cholagogs and Flegmagogs.</p>
                  <p>The Fluxion being ſtopt by Evacuation, Revulſion and Derivation, the Derivation of the Humour ſtuft into the Tongue muſt be endeavoured; to which end the Veins under the Tongue muſt be opened: But if it cannot be done, by reaſon of the bigneſs of the Tongue, a Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glaſs, with Scarification, muſt be applied under the Chin.</p>
                  <p>If the Tumour tends to Suppuration, it muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by applying a Fig cut in the middle, which muſt be frequently changed, or by a Gargariſm made of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Barly, Mallows, Violets, Figs, Raiſins of the Sun, of the Seeds of Quinces and Fenugreek, adding to them Syrup of Violets and of Jujubs.</p>
                  <p>Suppuration being made, if the Abſceſs does not break of it ſelf, let it be opened with a Knife, and the Ulcer muſt be preſently cleanſed with a Decoction of Barly, Agrimony and Plantane, with Honey of Roſes.</p>
                  <p>But a ſoft and looſe Tumour ariſing from Flegm, is cured firſt by Revulſion made by Bleeding, if the Sick abound with Blood; afterwards ſome ſtrong Purge muſt be given, as is the Pill Coch minor: But if the Sick can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take Pills, a ſtrong Purging Potion muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>After theſe Evacuations, cooling and repelling Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines muſt be applied at the beginning: The Tongue may be waſhed with the Juices of Lemons, Pomegranates, Sorrel, of Plantane, or with Simple Oxymel, to which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65404:59"/>
may be added in the increaſe of the Diſeaſe, a little Ginger, Sal Gemma, or Sal Armoniack. <hi>Zacutus Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> in a very dangerous caſe, when Suffocation was feared, by reaſon of the bigneſs of the Tongue, applied four Leeches to it, and ſoon after a great quantity of Blood was evacuated, and the Tongue aſſwaged. The ſame <hi>Zacutus</hi> Scarrified the Tongue deep in a Boy of Ten Years of Age, when the Tongue was ſoft, and by that means a great quantity of Salt-water flowed out, and the Patient was preſently cured.</p>

                  <p>A Ranula is a Tumour under the Tongue, in that part wherein it is joyned to its bridle; and ſo great is this Tumour moſt commonly, that it riſes higher than the lower Teeth; a cleft is in the middle of it, whereby it is divided into right and left, and by this means it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the hinder part of a Frog, from whence it takes its name: It is of the Nature of a <hi>Meliceris,</hi> and the Matter which flows from it is like Honey, and contained in a Bag, and in this Bag a Stone is ſometimes found.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt commonly without danger, but it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous when it looks black and brown, and is hard, for then it is of a Cancerous Nature, and ought not to be medled with.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure of this Diſeaſe, Firſt the antecedent Cauſe muſt be taken away; and if it be Inveterate, then you muſt uſe Cauteries and Sudorifick Decoctions,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65404:60"/>
Afterwards you muſt endeavour to diſſolve it by Topical Remedies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Pomegranate-peel, of dried Hyſſop, and of common Salt, each two drams; make a Powder to be held under the Tongue, and to be repeated often.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Foreſtus</hi> ſays, That a Girl of Twelve Years of Age was cured by this Remedy within two days: But in grown People it is beſt to uſe Sal Armoniack, which diſſolves and penetrates more powerfully.</p>
                  <p>But if the Tumour cannot be cured by Medicines that diſcuſs, it muſt be opened, which moſt commonly muſt be done; for it is ſeldom diſſolved; but a large Apertio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> muſt be made, that all the Matter may come out toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; afterwards the Ulcer muſt be waſhed, firſt with gentle things, as with a Decoction of Mallows, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with cleanſing things, as with Whitewine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mixed with Honey of Roſes: Laſtly, With Oxymel: When the Ulcer appears clear, and free from the Bag, it muſt be cicatrized, by waſhing the Mouth often with Allum diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Claret.</p>
                  <p>If the Ulcer be Inveterate, and cannot be cured by the foreſaid Remedies, touch it twice a day with the Oyl of Sulphur, tempered with Roſe-water, <hi>viz.</hi> Mix one drop of the Oyl with five or ſix drops of the Water; for ſo the Intemperies will be corrected, and the part dried; which may be alſo ſtrengthned by waſhing the Mouth often with a Diſſolution of Allum in Claret: But if it will not be cured by theſe means, the actual Cautery muſt be uſed. You may ſee the manner of uſing of it in <hi>Paraeus,</hi> Book VII. Chap. 5.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XLV. Of Taſting diminiſhed, aboliſhed or depraved.</head>
                  <p>TAſting, as the other Senſes, and all the Actions of the Body, is injured three ways, it is diminiſhed, aboliſhed and depraved. It is diminiſhed when it ſcarce perceives Taſts that are not ſtrong, and but little ſuch as are. It is aboliſhed when it cannot taſte any thing. And laſtly, It is depraved, when it ſuppoſes the Object taſts differently from what it really does.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes of Diminution, and Abolition of Taſting are the ſame, they only differ in degree; for if they are ſmall, they only diminiſh the Taſte; if they are great they aboliſh it.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes are either a Defect of the Animal Spirits in the part, or an Intemperies of the Nerve, that comes from the third Pair to the Tongue, or the Tongue it ſelf is ſome way preternaturally indiſpoſed.</p>
                  <p>The Spirits are in fault, either by reaſon of the Paucity of them, as in People that are Dying; or upon account of Obſtructions of the Nerves of the third Pair through which they are conveyed; or by reaſon of a Tumour in that part of the Brain from whence the Nerves riſe.</p>
                  <p>The Tongue is either covered with a moiſt and Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Humour, or it is affected with Tumours, Puſtles or Ulcers; and by theſe its proper Action, or the Senſe of Taſting, may be either diminiſhed or aboliſhed.</p>
                  <p>The Taſte is depraved when the Tongue is affected with ſome vitious Humour, as in Feavers, when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Choler, all things ſeem bitter; and when it is infected with Salt Flegm, or a Melancholly Humour, all things taſte Acid or Salt; for the External Objects coming upon the Tongue move the vitious Juice of it; and ſo all things that are taſted ſeem of the ſame Taſte with the Humour in the Tongue: But ſometimes the Tongue perceives the Taſte of the Juices contained in it, although no External Object come near it. This is daily ſeen in Feavers, when the Tongue is infected with Choler,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65404:61"/>
for if it be very bitter, there is continually a bitter Taſte in the Mouth.</p>
                  <p>The Diverſity of the foreſaid Cauſes may be known by the Variety of the Taſts, and by the Diſpoſition of the Tongue; A ſweet Taſt, and a Redneſs of the Tongue ſignifies Blood, bitter Taſte and a Yellow Colour ſignifies Choler; whiteneſs with Sweetneſs Flegm; a brown Colour and Sharpneſs Melancholly; an abominable Taſte ſhows ill Humours contained in the Stomach: Puſtles, Tumours, and Ulcers may be eaſily ſeen. But laſtly, if there be no Alteration ſeen in the Tongue, and yet the taſt is either diminiſhed or aboliſhed, we muſt ſuppoſe that the Cauſe lies hid in the Brain or Nerves.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is various according to the Variety of the Cauſes, and therefore if the Diſeaſe be in the Brain or Nerves, ſuch Medicines muſt be ordered as are uſed for the Cure of a Palſie: But when the Taſte is depraved by vitious Humours, that Symptom moſt commonly proceeds from other Diſeaſes, eſpecially from Feavers, which being cur'd the Symptom ceaſes,</p>
                  <p>If the Taſte be injured by Tumours, the Cure of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the Cure of them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If the Fault ariſe from Puſtles or Ulcers of the Tongue, the Cure of thoſe muſt be undertaken by bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and purging, and with the Application of cooling drying and aſtringent Topicks, in the Form of a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſm. But if the Ulcers are ſordid, they muſt be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Honey of Roſes, ſharpned moderately with Oyl of Vitriol, or of Sulphur. But when you would dry more powerfully, the affected Part muſt be touched once and again with the Oyls unmixed. And ſo may be cured Aphthae and all Ulcers of the Mouth and Tongue preſently.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XLVI. Of a <hi>Palſie</hi> of the Tongue, and of the Motion of it Hurt.</head>
                  <p>THe chief Action of the Tongue is Speech, and that is aboliſhed, diminiſhed and depraved by various Cauſes, which have Reference to Simular, Organick, or common Diſeaſes. As to Simular, a moiſt Intemperies joyned with Matter renders the Tongue too ſoft and looſe, ſo that it cannot move readily; alſo too much Dryneſs hinders Speech, which happens in Feavers; but Organick Diſeaſes are magnitude increaſed, as was ſaid before of Tumours, which hinders the free Motion of the Tongue; the Figure of it faulty, as when the Tongue is naturally too ſhort, or when the Top of it is cut off, or when the Bridle is too ſtrait, and an Obſtruction of the Nerves of the ſeventh Pair, which are brought to the Muſcles that move the Tongue.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Common Diſeaſes are a Solution of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuum, and Wounds of the Part.</p>
                  <p>Too great a Moiſture of the Tongue cauſes Stammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuch ſo affected cannot pronounce the Letter <hi>R,</hi> and it is either native as in Children, who by reaſon of too great Moiſture are troubled with it, and are freed from it in Progreſs of Time, whereby the Superfluous Moiſture is conſumed; But in ſome it remains all their Life long, and they always Stammer.</p>
                  <p>But in ſome Stammering is accedental, and comes from a Catarrh, and from a great Fluxion of a Flegmatick Humour falling upon the Jaws or Tongue, and is cured by Evacuation, Revulſion, and Derivation, and by ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and drying the Head.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of a Palſie of the Tongue, is performed by taking off the antecedent Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Humour abounding in the Brain, and by diſcuſſing the Conjunct Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Humour thruſt into the Nerves moving the Tongue. And firſt, Purging muſt be ordered, and Bleeding muſt be uſed if Blood abound, and ſuch a Quantity muſt be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65404:62"/>
taken away as is agreeable to the Age and Strength of the Patient; afterwards Cephalick things muſt be uſed, and if the Diſeaſes be obſtinate, a Sudorifick Diet-drink.</p>
                  <p>After univerſal Evacuations, Derivation of the Morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Matter muſt be made by Cupping-glaſſes, and Bliſters applied to the Neck, and by an Iſſue in the hinder part of the Head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Avicen</hi> applies a Cupping-glaſs to the Chin, which is alſo approved of by late Authors. Bleeding under the Tongue is alſo uſed ſucceſsfully after general Evacuations; and to diſcuſs the Humour the following Gargariſm is frequently uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Florentine-orris half an ounce, of the Leaves of wild Marjoram, Sage, Staechas, Roſemary, each half an handful, of Cubebs three drams, of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh, one ounce; boil them in equal Parts of Water, and Whitewine added towards the end; to one Pint ſtrain it, and diſſolve in it two ounces of Oxymel of Squils; mlke a Gargariſm. But if it be not ſtrong enough to do the buſineſs, two or three drams of the Roots of Pellitory of Spain, or the like quantity of Muſtard-ſeed may be added to it. Caſtor alſo may be added if it be not too unpleaſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Juice of Sage is much commended the Tongue being rub'd with it, you may alſo add Muſtard-ſeed to it. The following Pills may be alſo held frequently upon the Tongue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Juice of Bettony, and Liquoriſh, each one dram and an half, of Caſtor, and Aſſa-faetida, each half a dram, of Nutmeg, and Spicknard, each one ſcruple, make them up into ſmall Pills with Honey,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fumes and Powders ſprinkled into the Hair, and the like, muſt be uſed to ſtrengthen the Brain, and to diſcuſs the Relicts of the Flegmatick Humour.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, To hinder the Growth of new Matter, which the Intemperies of the Brain is wont to cauſe, after general and particular Evacuations things that ſtrengthen the Head muſt be uſed.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XLVII. Of Pains of the Teeth.</head>
                  <p>THe Pain of the Teeth is occaſioned by the Influx of Humours, which are either Cold, Flegmatick, Hot, Serous, Salt, or Acrid; Worms alſo bred in rotten Teeth occaſions Pain, and ſome think that the Pain proceeds ſometimes from Wind.</p>
                  <p>The External and Procatarctick Cauſes occaſioning Pain in the Teeth, are all thoſe things which promote Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Humours; the chief whereof are cold Air, or Southerly Winds, ſtanding long in the Heat of the Sun, or abroad in the Night, ſurfetting, and all Errors in Diet. To theſe add Rottenneſs of the Teeth, which weakens them and renders them more apt to receive Fluxions.</p>
                  <p>The Diverſity of the Cauſes may be known by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Signs, when the Pain ariſes from hot Humours it is very violent, the Conſtitution hot, the Age flouriſhing, it is Summer, there is great Heat in the Part, and often an Inflammation of the Gums, cooling Medicines give Eaſe; hot increaſe the Pain; But if the Pain ariſe from cold Humours, Signs contrary to theſe appear.</p>
                  <p>If Worms are the Cauſe the Pain is by Intervals, and the Motion of the Worm is ſometimes perceived in the Part.</p>
                  <p>Pain is likewiſe produced by a Flatuous Spirit, which appears by the vehemency and tearing Pain which is felt in the Part, and which goes off in a little time,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65404:63"/>
and is eaſily cured, by applying diſcutient Remedies to the place.</p>
                  <p>The Prognoſtick is various according to the Variety of the Cauſes. A Pain which is occaſioned by a hot, thin, or ſharp, acrid and ſalt Humour, is the more vehement indeed, but ſooner goes off, by reaſon of the ſudden Changes of the Humours; that which proceeds from a cold and Flegmatick Humour, is more gentle but of long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Duration.</p>
                  <p>A Tumour ariſing in the Gums or Jaws, eaſes the Pain of the Teeth, by reaſon that the Fluxion is carried to the exterior Parts; ſo that it falls no more upon the Cavity of the Teeth.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, the Cauſe of the Pain muſt be taken away, and the Pain it ſelf mitigated. And although Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyns have no great Effect, unleſs the Fluxion be taken off, yet it is often ſo violent, that it muſt not only be mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Anodyns, properly ſo called, but alſo with Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coticks before the Cauſe be removed. Therefore the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which flows to the Teeth muſt be drawn back, evacuated and repelled; that which is already flown in, muſt be diſcuſſed and carried off by Derivation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, If the Pain ariſe from hot Humours, Bleeding muſt be uſed in the Arm of the ſame Side, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Revulſion of the Humour may be made; but if the Pain proceeds from cold Humours, Bleeding is not ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but by reaſon of the Fluxion it may be uſed becauſe it principally makes Revulſion; but a ſmall quantity of Blood muſt be taken away, unleſs the Signs of a Plethora appear; for in that caſe large Bleeding may be allowed, which is the beſt means to eaſe the Pain in the Teeth, and all other Pains.</p>
                  <p>The next Day ſome purging Medicine muſt be given, that is proper for the peccant Humour; afterwards if the Pain continues, Cupping-glaſſes with Scarification muſt be applied to the Shoulders, or a large Cupping-glaſs without Scarification; a Bliſter may be applied to the Neck or behind the Ears, for it draws powerfully the Humours backward.</p>
                  <p>And to ſtop the Flux Aſtringents are properly applied to the Temples; ſuch are the Plaiſters of Gum-elemi, of Maſtich alone, or ad Herniam.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:65404:63"/>The freſh Roots of Comfrey, bruiſed and applied to the Temples are excellent for ſtopping of Fluxion, alſo the Powder, of Allum and Galls made into a Plaiſter with Pitch are very effectual.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Riverius,</hi> chief Phyſician to <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, kept the following Plaiſter as a great Secret.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Pine-nuts, and red Roſes, of the Seeds of Creſſes torrified, of Maſtich, and ſeal'd Earth, each one dram and an half, infuſe them in Roſe Vinegar twenty four Hours, afterwards dry them, and add of Opium diſſolved in Aqua Vitae three ounces, of Ship Pitch and Colophony, each one Ounce, of Yellow Wax melted in the Oyls of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane, and white Poppies, by Expreſſion a ſufficient quantity, make a Plaiſter, which muſt be applied to the Arteries and pained Part.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Medicines alſo are put into the Ears for Pain in the Teeth, becauſe the Arteries which nouriſh the Teeth do paſs by the Ears; upon that account, Oyl of bitter Almonds is put into the Ear next to the Tooth affected, alſo a Suffumigation of Vinegar, in which Penyroyal, or wild Marjoram hath been boiled, is often uſed.</p>
                  <p>Vinegar is alſo dropt into the Ear, by which the Flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion is powerfully ſtopped, and it is moſt effectual in a hot Fluxion.</p>
                  <p>But in a hot Fluxion, Juice of Garlick mixed with Venice Treacle, and dropt warm into the Ear, mitigates the Pain powerfully: Alſo the Root of Garlick, the Bark being taken off, and made in the form of a Suppoſitory, and put into the Ear, produces the ſame Effect.</p>
                  <p>Aſtringents are alſo applied in the beginning of the Fluxion, and they ought to be cold if the Matter be hot; but if it be cold, hot Medicines mixed with thoſe that are repelling are to be uſed; in whatever Cauſe, if the Pain be violent, Anodyns are to be mixed with Diſcutients. To which Purpoſe the following Medicine may be preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Cinquefoil, Biſtort, Tormentill, each one dram, of the Leaves of Vervain, Plantain, and Mullein, each one handful, Cypreſs-nuts, Galls, and Cups of Acrons, each two drams, of red Sanders, a dram

                  </p>
                  <p>This Decoction may be uſed in the beginning of a hot Fluxion, in a cold one you may add the Roots of Cyperus, the Bark of Box-wood, Ivy-leaves and the like.</p>
                  <p>A more Simple Medicine may be prepared of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and Roſe Water, with a little Vinegar, after the manner of an Oxycrat.</p>
                  <p>Or the Teeth muſt be waſhed with a Decoction of Galls in Vinegar. Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Cinquefoil-roots half an ounce, of Willow-leaves half an handful, boil them in aſtringent Wine, and waſh the Mouth with the Decoction.</hi>

                  <p>Cotton dipt in Oyl of Cloves, and put into the Hollow Tooth is frequently uſed to eaſe the Pain, Oyl of Box alſo does the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But if the Pain be ſo violent that it cannot be quelled with the foreſaid Remedies, we muſt uſe Narcoticks, which may be applied to the pained Tooth, but they moſt certainly give Eaſe being taken inwardly; you may give three or four grains of the London Laudanum, it gives eaſe and ſtops the Fluxion.</p>

                     <hi>Take of Aloes one Dram, of Champhor ten Grains, of Aqua Vitae half a dram, mingle them, and apply them to the Teeth with Cotton,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to be noted, that there is ſeldom a Pain in the Teeth, unleſs they are Hollow, and untill they are eaten through to the Nerve; wherefore that the Pain may be taken off, the Nerve muſt be burnt, either with an actual Cautery, or with Aqua fortis, or Oyl of vitriol put into the Cavity.</p>
                  <p>But if notwithſtanding all theſe means the Pain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, the Tooth muſt be drawn, but care muſt be taken
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65404:65"/>
that the Tooth be not drawn when the Fluxion ruſhes violently upon it, or when the Headach accompanies it; or the Gums are ſwelled, and when the Pain is violent; and the Tooth-drawer muſt be admoniſhed, that he does not pluck it out violently at once, leaſt a concuſſion of the Brain ſhou'd follow, or the breaking of the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, upon which violent Bleeding, a Feaver, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Death comes. As ſoon as the Tooth is drawn, the Part from whence it is taken muſt be preſſed on every ſide, that it may be reſtored to its natural State, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards let the Sick waſh his Mouth with warm Oxycrat, and let him be careful leaſt he catch cold, whereby a new Fluxion may fall upon other Teeth.</p>
                  <p>But if Blood flow ſo much as that it can ſcarce be ſtopt, which ſometimes happens, though the Jaw be not broken, by reaſon of a Vein or Artery torn. This Flux of Blood is moſt commonly ſtopt by applying Lint rolled up hard, and preſſing it hard down an hour or two with the Fingers. But if this does not ſucceed; burnt Vitriol muſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plyed, and a Rag dipt in Vinegar over it, which alſo muſt be preſſed down with the Finger, till it be cruſted. The laſt Remedy is an actual Cautery, which preſently ſtops the Blood.</p>
                  <p>But if any timerous Perſon cannot bare the drawing of a Tooth, but deſires to have it extracted by Remedies.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe things are to be tryed, which are propoſed every where by Authors for the ſame purpoſe, as a Paſte made of Frankincenſe powdered, a little Starch, and the Milk of Spurge, the Root of Crow-foot, the Bark of the Root of Mulberry Tree, the Aſhes of Earth-Worms, Pellitory of Spain ſteep'd in Vinegar, the Root of wild Cucumber in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed in Vinegar, and the like. But Bears-foot is the moſt effectual, the Tooth being rub'd with the Leaf of it bruiſed, but great care muſt be taken, that the other Teeth be not touched with it; for if ſo, they wou'd be in danger to drop out. A certain Country Fellow being grievouſly afflicted with the Toothach, deſired another to rub his Teeth with Bears-foot, who unwarily rub'd almoſt all his Teeth with it, and in a few hours almoſt all of them dropt out. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any one intends to uſe ſo violent a Medicine, I wou'd adviſe him to cover the reſt of his Teeth with Wax to ſecure them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:65404:65"/>Though the Tumour ariſing in the Jaws moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly takes off the Pain of the Teeth, the Matter being tranſlated to the outward parts; yet to procure Eaſe the ſooner ſome Remedies muſt be uſed: The following Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Freſh-Butter and Hens-greaſe each one ounce, of the Powder of Florentine Orris one dram, of Saffron half a Scruple, of Oyl of Camomil, and Oyl of Sweet-Almonds, each half an Ounce; make a Liniment to be applied to the Jaws.</hi>

                  <p>Nettles bruiſed and applied to the Jaws ſoon eaſe the Pain.</p>
                  <p>This Cure is for the preſent Pain, but if it be wont to return frequently, the generation of Humours flowing to the part muſt be hindred, and the Teeth muſt be ſtrengthned, that they may not ſo eaſily receive the Humours flowing to them.</p>

                  <p>THE Teeth are often Black, Yellow or Livid, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of vitious Humours ſticking to their Superficies, which by lying long on them corrode, and make them rotten; ill Vapors do the ſame, which ariſe from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome Meats eaten, or from an Intemperies of the Stomach; Quick-ſilver uſed to the whole Body, or to the Face to Beautifie it, blackens the Teeth: Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Women that uſe Paint are wont to have black or foul Teeth.</p>
                  <p>In order to the Cure, the antecedent Cauſe muſt be firſt removed, and if ill Humours abounding in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach occaſion this Diſeaſe, they muſt be evacuated, and the Intemperies producing it muſt be corrected, and a

good Courſe of Diet muſt be ordered, and ſuch Meats muſt be avoided as are apt to corrupt the Teeth, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe that are Sweet.</p>
                  <p>There are a great many Medicines propoſed to whiten the Teeth by Authors, which every one may make trial of; we uſe only one, which preſently frees the Teeth from all Filthineſs, and renders them white; and alſo preſerves them from a Caries, that is, the Spirit of Vitriol or of Sulphur, in which a ſmall Stick wrapt round with a Rag may be dipt, and the Teeth rubbed with it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Teeth muſt be dried with a clean Linnen Cloth.</p>
                  <p>When the Teeth are very foul, the pure Oyl may be uſed, or mixed with Honey of Roſes, or it may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected with Simple Water, leaſt the uſe of it corrode the Gums. <hi>Montanus</hi> relates that he learned this from a Woman at <hi>Rome,</hi> whom he had ſeen when he was very young, and ſhe about the Age of Twenty; he found her afterwards when ſhe was Fifty in the ſame Condition, who had preſerved her Beauty and Strength by the uſe of the Oyl of Vitriol; and that her Teeth which were very ill in her Youth were become firm and clean in her old Age by the uſe of it; for ſhe was wont daily to rub her Teeth and Gums gently with a drop or two of it.</p>
                  <p>The Aſhes of Tobacco are alſo excellent to cleanſe and whiten the Teeth.</p>
                  <p>But to preſerve them and to keep them clean, they muſt be daily cleanſed from Filth, and Meat that ſticks in them, by a Tooth-picker, made of the <hi>Lignum Leutiſcinum.</hi> Afterwards you muſt waſh the Mouth with Wine, and the Teeth muſt be rubbed with the following Powder.</p>

                  <p>THE Gums are eaten and ulcerated by Acrid and Corroding Humours flowing to them from the Brain, Stomach, Spleen, and other Parts. Splenetick People are more eſpecially troubled with Ulcers of the Gums, and ſuch as are Scorbutick; and ſometimes alſo the Gums are corroded by Worms, or by the Humours that occaſion them; ſo that when they continue long to be ſo, they ſignifie Worms to be in the Body. <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> mentions an Obſervation of a Boy, that was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a long while with corroded Gums, and after he had tried many Medicines both inward and outward, at length he died, and his Body being opened, there were found great numbers of Worms, which had eaten through his Guts, and lay in the Cavity of the Belly.</p>
                  <p>The Cure muſt be firſt directed to the Antecedent Cauſe, and the Peccant Humours muſt be evacuated by Bleeding and Purging. The Acrid and Hot muſt be attemperated by Apozems, Juleps, and medicated Broths, and the like. And the Fluxions of the ſame Humours is to be turned, by applying Cupping-glaſſes to proper places. And laſtly, The Diſeaſes of the Part principally affected muſt be cured.</p>
                  <p>And afterwards we muſt uſe Topicks, which are to be varied according to the greatneſs of the Diſeaſe, for in a ſimple Erroſion thoſe things are only to be applied which are Aſtringent and dry: And firſt the following Lotion muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of unripe Galls, of the Cups of Acorns, and of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauſtins, each one dram; of red Roſes one Pugil; of Crude-allum three drams; boil them in two parts of Smiths water, and one of rough Wine: The Teeth muſt be often waſhed with this Water, and if the Erroſion is not cured with it, the following Opiat muſt be uſed.</hi>

                  <p>Spirit of Sulphur either by it ſelf or mixed with Honey of Roſes, cleanſes and whitens the Teeth, and cures the Corruption of the Gums.</p>

                  <p>BLOOD ſometimes flows in a great quantity from the Gums, either Critically or Symptomatically: But though a Critical Hemorrhage ſeldom happens by the Gums, yet that it does ſo ſometimes, Experience and the Obſervations from Authors ſhow.</p>
                  <p>It flows Symptomatically from the Gums, by reaſon of its Acrimony, and of the vitious Conſtitution of the Spleen, and alſo the Scurvy: It alſo ſometimes flows plentifully
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65404:67"/>
after the drawing of a Tooth; the little Artery being torn, which was inſerted into the Root of the Tooth; upon which account ſometimes ſo much Blood flows as kills the Patient.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of a Symptomatick Flux is performed by Bleeding, and Purging, and other Remedies that correct the Diſorders of the Bowels; afterwards Topicks muſt be uſed that are of an Aſtringent Nature, in the form of a Gargariſm, Lotion, Powder, Liniment, or Opiate.</p>
                  <p>If a great quantity of Blood flows upon drawing a Tooth, Revulſion firſt muſt be made by Bleeding, and Cupping-glaſſes and Aſtringent Medicines muſt be applied to the part; as a Cataplaſm made of Bole-armenick, Dragons Blood, ſealed Earth, and other Aſtringents mixed with the white of an Egg.</p>
                  <p>If theſe things do not do, the Patient muſt apply his Finger to the part from whence the Blood flows, and muſt be kept there ſo long, till the Blood coagulated upon the Orifice of the Artery ſtops the Flux.</p>
                  <p>If the Blood cannot be ſtopt by theſe gentle means, ſtronger muſt be uſed.

                  <head>CHAP. LI. Of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers of the Mouth and Jaws.</head>
                  <p>SMALL and Superficial Ulcers of the Mouth are called Aphthae, and when they are large they go under the common name of Ulcers, as thoſe are that happen to Pocky People.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Ulcers are wont to be generated by Acrid Humours, or Vapors tranſlated from various parts of the Body to the Jaws. So in Malignant Feavers, ſuch Ulcers frequently happen, and to thoſe which are of a hot Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and are ſubject to an Intemperies of the Parts,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65404:68"/>
and to others that abound with corrupted Humours, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Account Children are frequently troubled with Aphthae.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Ulcers are various, not only for that ſome are ſmall, ſome greater, and becauſe ſome trouble Children, and ſome grown People, but alſo becauſe an Inflammation accompanies ſome of them, and others it do's not. Theſe various Degrees happen according to the variety of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours from whence they are generated, for either they proceed from Blood, Choler, Flegm, or Melancholy, or rather from black Choler, which is of a burning and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Quality.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Differences may be known by their proper Signs, for red Ulcers proceed from Blood, yellow from Choler, white from Flegm, livid from black Choler, a ſtinking Ulcer ſignifies Putrefaction.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick, Aphthae properly ſo called are eaſily cured, but deep Ulcers, or ſuch as are putrid are difficultly cured, and they are moſt dangerous in Children, both becauſe they ſpread more by reaſon of the Softneſs of their Fleſh, and alſo, becauſe they cannot bear ſtrong Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; upon which account Children ſometimes die of them, if they are accompanied with Putrefaction and Malignity.</p>
                  <p>And with reſpect to the Cauſe from whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, they are more or leſs Dangerous; if they proceed from Flegm there is little Danger, if from Blood, or Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, there is more, if from black Choler moſt of all.</p>
                  <p>Black and cruſty Ulcers are deadly, eſpecially in Children.</p>
                  <p>Ulcers of the Jaws accompanied with a Feaver are dangerous.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, a cooling and drying Diet muſt be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to hinder the Generation of the Antecedent Cauſe; wherefore if in Children, the Diſeaſe ariſes from a Fault in the Milk, either the Nurſe muſt be changed, or her Milk muſt be corrected by proper Meats and Drinks, and by Bleeding and purging if there be Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt be ſure to preſcribe a cooling and aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Diet to the Nurſe, as Quinces, Pears, Medlars, Lettice, and Purſlain. The ſame muſt be preſcribed for grown People, and they muſt avoid acrid, ſalt, and pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Meats.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:65404:68"/>Moreover with reſpect to the antecedent Cauſe, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Evacuations muſt be preſcribed, according to the Age of the Sick, and firſt, Bleeding makes a powerful Revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Humours flowing to the Part, and attemperates their Acrimony, and cools the whole Body. Afterwards Cupping-glaſſes with Scarification muſt be applied, Leeches behind the Ears, and under the Chin, and a Bliſter muſt be applied to the Neck. The next Day after Bleeding Purging muſt be ordered ſuitable to the peccant Humour, and the Age,</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, <hi>viz.</hi> From the very beginning of the Cure, Topicks muſt be applied; but ſuch as are gentle muſt be firſt uſed, as Gargariſms, or Lotions made with the Waters of Plantain, or Honey-ſuckle, and ſweetned with Syrup of dried Roſes, or of Mulberries, or of a Decoction, of Plantain Leaves, Bramble-tops, knot-graſs, Balauſtins, red Sanders, and the like, with the foreſaid Syrups. And if there be an Inflammation, it is proper to add the Juice of Night-ſhade, Houſe-leek or of Purſlain, and Sal Prunella, in ſuch Quantity as may not ſharpen it too much, or inſtead of them a ſmall Quantity of Crude Allum may be mixed with it. If there be no Inflammation, Spirit of Vitriol, or Sulphur is the only Remedy which may be uſed by it ſelf to grown People; The Ulcer being touched with a Stick wrapped round the top, with a Rag dipt in it, and ſo ſimple Aphthae will be cured im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
                  <p>But for Children the Spirit muſt be mixed with Honey of Roſes to mitigate the Sharpneſs, and muſt be uſed with a Stick, as above directed.</p>
                  <p>If the Ulcers are very painful, and accompanied with Inflammation; the Mouth muſt be often gargled with Milk, or with an Emulſion of the cold Seeds, or with a Mucilage of the Seeds of Fleabean, and of Quinces extracted with Plantain and Roſe-water.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If the pain be ſo very obſtinate that it cannot be appeaſed by the Revulſions and Topicks propoſed; but by Reaſon of the Violence of it, ſharp Humours are continually attracted, and long Watchings occaſioned, and a Waſting of the whole Body, whereby the Life is much endangered, the laſt Remedy are Narcoticks, which eaſe the Pain, and hinders the Influx of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65404:69"/>
they are to be doſed according to the Age and Strength of the Patient.</p>
                  <p>I cured a Boy, ſays <hi>Riverius,</hi> of four Years of Age, when he was juſt dying, by giving him a grain of Laudanum. His Jaws and Tongue were full of deep Ulcers, and the Inflammation ſo great, that he cou'd not bear Topick Remedies, and the Flux of Humours ſo much, that they flowed perpetually out of his Mouth like a Stream, and the Child cryed Night and Day.</p>
                  <p>If the Ulcer be putrid, and ſordid, it muſt be firſt waſhed with a Decoction made of Barley and Honey of Roſes, and in Children, with Milk wherein Steel has been quenched, mixed with conſerve of Roſes; afterwards you muſt uſe things that are ſtronger, Honey of Roſes is the chief, made acid with the Spirit of Vitriol.</p>
                  <p>If theſe are not ſufficient, burnt Allum may be added to the things abovementioned, or Unguentum Aegyptia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, in a greater or leſſer quantity, according to the Degree of the Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If the Ulcer of the Jaws proceed from the French Pox, it cannot be cured until that is taken off.</p>

                  <p>THe Relaxation of the Uvula, happens by reaſon of a Flegmatick Humour, falling from the Head upon it, wherewith ſome Blood is often mixed, and then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation accompanies the Relaxation, which alſo frequently happens to the Almonds, concerning the Cure of which Inflammations we ſhall ſay nothing; becauſe the Cure of them is performed by the ſame Remedies which were propoſed for the Cure of an Inflammation of the Tongue, and for Ulcers of the Mouth with Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p>The Flegmatick Humour falling upon the Uvula, moiſtens, ſoftens, and ſo relaxes it, that it touches the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of the Oeſophagus, and creates Nauſeouſneſs,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65404:69"/>
and thoſe that are ſo affected, always endeavour in vain to ſwallow ſomething that lies at the top of the Oeſopha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, and by this Sign without Inſpection, the Relaxation of the Uvula may be known.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of it muſt be firſt directed to the anticedent cauſe, wherefore the Humours flowing from the Head, muſt be evacuated, and diverted by thoſe Remedies which are propoſed for the Cure of a Catarrh.</p>
                  <p>The Topicks which are uſed in the Beginning muſt be aſtringent and repellent, ſuch as were propoſed for Ulcers in the Jaws and Gums; afterwards the things that are drying and aſtringent muſt be mixed with them; and though the Gargariſms propoſed in the ſaid Places, are profitable in theſe Caſes; yet when there is no Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the uſe of Powders is more effectual. For by them the relaxed Uvula is more powerfully dried and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And therefore the Bark of Pomegranates finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſhould be firſt uſed, and in progreſs a little Pepper may be uſed with it. Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of red Roſes, Balauſtines, Pomegranate-peel, each half a dram, of the Roots of Biſtort, Tormentil, and unripe Galls, and of Florentine-orris, each one dram, of burnt Allum two Scruples, make a Powder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Common Chyrurgeons apply long Pepper powdered to it, but it is not ſafe, for there is Danger leaſt the Humours ſhould be drawn violently to the Part affected, and ſo ſhould occaſion ſome great Miſchief.</p>
                  <p>The manner of uſing theſe Powders is as follows: The Tongue muſt be depreſſed with a Speculum-oris, and then with a Spatula, or with a ſmall Spoon for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; the Powder muſt be conveyed to the Uvula, often in a Day, till the Humour imbibed be wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
                  <p>But if the Uvula relaxed cannot be reduced by the foreſaid Remedies to it's former State, but ſtill continues troubleſome by being ſo long, the top of it muſt be cut off; but care muſt be taken that too much of it be not cut off, for if ſo the Speech and Reſpiration wou'd be injured.</p>

                     <hi>Take of Plantane-water, and red Roſe-water, and of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Spawn of Frogs, each four ounces; the Whites of three Eggs turned to a Water by beating, of White Sugar-candy three Drams, make a Gargariſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I likewiſe order, that the Patient take dayly of the Emulſion preſcribed in the Cure of a Pleuriſie or the like. The next Morning I bleed again, unleſs the Feaver, and difficulty of Swallowing ſomewhat abate, and defer Purging till the next Day: But if both theſe are leſſened, I preſently give a lenitive Purge. If the Feaver and other Symptoms are like to be troubleſome, after purging they are to be quelled by Bleeding repeated as before, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65404:70"/>
a large and ſtrong Bliſter to the Neck, a cooling and emollient Gliſter is to be injected every Morning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when the Patient purges, through the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe. The uſe of Fleſh of all kinds, and their Broths are to be forbid, and the Patient is to be dieted with Oatmeal and Barley Broths, and roaſted Apples, and the like, let him uſe a Ptiſan of Barley or ſmall Beer. Let him keep up ſome Hours every Day, for the warmth of the Bed heightens the Feaver, and other Symptoms. But it is to be noted, that ſuch a Quinſie which is only a Symptom of a Feaver I call ſtationary, is to be cured by that Method which is requiſite for the Feaver, and ſo is either to be taken off by Sweat and Tranſpiration, or by any other Method of Cure which is neceſſary for the primary Feaver whereon it depends, which is worth Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THough an Aſthma is taken for a Difficulty of Breathing in general, yet it principally Signifies that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a ſtoppage of the Lungs, and an Obſtruction of the Bronchia, which of its own Nature is without a Feaver, though ſometimes a Feaver accompanies it.</p>
                  <p>An Aſthma is divided into three Species, one is called Dyſpnoea, another Aſthma, the third Orthopnoea.</p>
                  <p>A Dyſpnoea is a difficulty of Breathing, ariſing from an Obſtruction of the Lungs; this is leſs than an Aſthma, or Orthopnoea, and ariſes from a ſmaller Quantity of Matter that obſtructs more the Subſtance of the Lungs, than the Bronchia; upon which account there is no Wheezing, which is occaſioned by a Commotion of the Humour contained in the Bronchia.</p>
                  <p>An Aſthma is a great and frequent Reſpiration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Diaphagma, the intercoſtal Muſcles, and the Muſcles of the Abdomen are violently moved, and a Wheezing accompanies it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:65404:71"/>But an Orthopnoea, is the greateſt Difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein the Sick can only breath, as the Word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, ſitting upright.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of an Aſthma is twofold, one in the Fit, and the other out of it; in the Fit a Gliſter being firſt given, Bleeding muſt be uſed; if Blood ſeem to abound in any Degree, and the Sick muſt be placed upright in a free Air, and Smoak, or the Breath of the Standers by muſt not offend him; and his Cloathes, or any thing elſe that covers his Breaſt muſt be looſned.</p>
                  <p>After Bleeding, or it being omitted, if it be not thought proper, a Phlegmagogue Purge muſt be given.</p>
                  <p>As to Vomits, though ſome diſlike them, yet are they very proper in this Diſeaſe, as is evident by Experience, and frequently the Fit is taken off by this Remedy alone. Sharp Gliſters are often to be injected to make a Revul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, nevertheleſs their Quantity ought to be ſmall Fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the inferior Parts are alſo to be uſed, and many Cupping-glaſſes are to be applied to them, and to the Neck; afterwards the groſs Humours muſt be moiſtned and attenuated, and the Wind ariſing from them muſt be diſcuſſed, to which Purpoſe the following Medicines muſt be given.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Take of the Oyntment of Marſh-mallows one ounce and an half, of Oyl of Anniſe-ſeeds thirty drops; make an Oyntment.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>It is to be noted, that Purging muſt be often uſed in this Diſeaſe, and the Form of them muſt be varied, leaſt Nature ſhould be too much accuſtomed to one and the ſame Remedy.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LV. Of a Pleuriſie.</head>
                  <p>THis Diſeaſe that is as frequent as any other, comes at any time, but eſpecially about the Spring and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for at that Time the Blood being heated by the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sun, ruſhes violently into efferveſcences and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Motions.</p>
                  <p>It chiefly ſeiſes thoſe that are of a ſanguine Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and often country People, and thoſe that are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65404:72"/>
to much Labour. It moſt commonly begins with a Shaking and Shivering, and then Heat, Drouth, and Reſtleſſneſs, and other Symptoms of a Feaver follow, after a few Hours, though (ſometimes it is much longer before this Symptom comes) the Patient is taken with a violent pricking Pain in one of his Sides about the Ribs, which ſometimes reaches towards the Shoulder-blades, ſometimes towards the Back-bone, and ſometimes towards the Breaſt, he coughs frequently, which occaſions great Pain, ſo that ſometimes he holds his Breath to prevent coughing; the Matter which is ſpit up at the beginning is little and thin, and often ſprinkled with Particles of Blood, but in the Proceſs of the Diſeaſe 'tis more and more concocted and mixt with Blood; the Feaver in the mean while keeps the ſame Pace, and is helpt on by thoſe Symptoms that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from it, and the ſaid Feaver with all its ill Train (<hi>viz.</hi> The Cough, the Spitting of Blood, the Pain, and the like) is gradually leſſened, according to the Degree of the free Expectoration of the Morbiſick Matter.</p>
                  <p>But the Matter occaſioning this Diſeaſe, does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the Proceſs of it attain the Concoction that is due to Expectoration; for it often happens, that the Matter ſpit up is yet little and thin, as at the beginning of the Diſeaſe; and conſequently the Feaver and other Symptoms do not at all remit till they have deſtroyed the Sick. In the mean while he is ſometimes bound in his Body, and ſometimes too looſe, the Stools being frequent and very liquid; it ſometimes happens when the Diſeaſe is very high, and Bleeding has not been uſed, the Patient is not able to Cough, but labouring under a great difficulty of breathing, is in a manner ſuffocated by the Violence of the Inflammation; which is ſometimes ſo very great that he can't open his Breaſt large enough for Reſpiration, without exquiſite Pain. And ſometimes after a violent Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when Bleeding has been ommitted which ought to have been uſed at the Beginning of the Diſeaſe, an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume is preſently occaſioned, and the Cavity of the Breaſt is filled with Matter; in which caſe tho the Original Feaver either wholly ceaſes, or is at leaſt leſſened, yet the Patient is not out of Danger, for an Empyema or an Hectick Feaver following, the Poor Wretch dies Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:65404:73"/>But now though a Pleuriſie commonly takes its riſe from the proper and ſpecifick Inflammation of the Blood, which is wont to produce it when it is an Original Diſeaſe. Yet it comes ſometimes accidentally upon other Feavers, of what kind ſoever they be, from a Precipitation of the Febrile Matter upon the Pleura, or intercoſtal Muſcles, and it happens for the moſt Part at the very beginning of the Feaver; the Febrile Matter being as yet crude, and not ſubdued by a fit Ebullition, and ſo not prepared for a due Separation; but this Inconvenience moſt commonly ariſes from an unſeaſonable and prepoſterous uſe of hot Medicines. For Nature being diſturbed by this means, is forced to expel the Humour, as yet crude by any Way; and ſo ſometimes the Feaveriſh Matter is impetuouſly caſt upon the Meninges of the Brain, and then a Frenzy is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned; and ſometimes upon the Membrane covering the Ribs, and from thence a Pleuriſie ariſes; eſpecially when the Age and Temperament of the Patient, and the Seaſon of the Year, betwixt Spring and Summer contribute to it. For certainly at that Seaſon Feavers are prone to turn to Pleuriſies.</p>
                  <p>Though this Diſeaſe has an ill Name, and is of it ſelf more dangerous than any other, yet if it be well managed it is eaſily cured, and indeed as certainly as other Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, as ſoon as I am called, I order that ten ounces of Blood be taken away from the Arm of the Side affected; and afterwards, I preſcribe the following Potion to be taken preſently after Bleeding.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Erratick Poppy-water four Ounces, of Sal Prunella one dram, of Syrup of Violets one ounce, mingle them, make a Draught.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the ſame time I preſcribe the following Emulſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of ſweet Almonds number ſeven, of the Seeds of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and Pompions, each half an ounce, of the Seeds of white Poppies two drams, beat them together in a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mortar, pouring gently upon them a Pint and an half of Barley-water, of Roſe-water two drams, of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar-candy half an ounce, mingle them, make an Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, give four ounces every fourth Hour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:65404:73"/>I alſo order Pectorals to be taken frequently: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take, of the Pectoral Decoction a quart, of Syrup of Violets and Maiden-hair, each one ounce and an half; mingle them, make an Apozem; let him take half a pint thrice a day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Oyl of Sweet-Almonds two Ounces, of Syrup of Violets, and Maiden-hair, each one ounce; of Sugar-candy half a dram; mingle them, make a Linctus, of which let the Patient lick often in a day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oyl of Almonds by it ſelf, or Oyl of Flax-ſeeds, is often uſed with good Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>As to Diet, I forbid the uſe of all Fleſh, and all Broths of it, though never ſo thin: I adviſe that the Patient be fed with Oaten and Barly-Broths and Panada, and let him drink of a Ptyſan made of Barly-water, with the Roots of Sorrel and Liquoriſh, and the like, and ſometimes Small-beer.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, I preſcribe the following Oyntment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Oyl of Sweet-Almonds two ounces, of the Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Marſh-mallows and Pomatum each one ounce; mingle them, make a Liniment, with which anoint the affected ſide Morning and Evening, applying upon it a Cabbage-leaf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I alſo order he ſhould perſiſt in the uſe of the ſaid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies through the whole Courſe of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſame day I am firſt called; if the Pain be very violent, I take away again the ſame quantity of Blood, or elſe the day following, and ſo the third day; and after this manner four times one day after another (unleſs the Patient be well before) when the Pain and other Symptoms rage violently; but if the Diſeaſe, being more moderate and leſs dangerous, permits me to proceed more gently; or if the Patient, being weak, cannot well bear Bleeding ſo often, I do not repeat it again after it has been twice uſed, till a day or two be paſt betwixt each Bleeding.</p>
                  <p>I have ſeldom obſerved, that a confirmed Pleuriſie has been cured in grown People with leſs than the loſs of forty
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65404:74"/>
Ounces of Blood, or thereabout; though in Children, once or twice Bleeding is moſt commonly ſufficient; nor does the Diarhea, which ſometimes comes upon this Diſeaſe, hinder the foreſaid repeated Bleeding; for indeed it may be ſoon ſtopt by this very Method, without any Aſtringent Medicine: But I either wholly omit Gliſters, or take care that they be injected at as great a diſtance as may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Bleedings; and they ſhould be only made of Milk and Sugar.</p>
                  <p>All the time of the Diſeaſe, I take care that the Patient be not over-heated, and therefore I give leave that he be taken every day out of his Bed, and that he keep up ſome hours according to his Strength; which is of ſo great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this kind of Diſeaſe, that if the Patient be kept continually in Bed, neither this ſo large Evacuation of Blood, nor other Remedies, how cooling ſoever, will ſometimes do any good for the taking off the ſaid Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>Preſently after the laſt Bleeding, unleſs perchance it happens before that all the Symptoms abate, and that the Patient (who has been kept hitherto for ſome days from all Spirituous Liquors and Strong Nouriſhment) ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers his Strength, it will be convenient to give a gentle Purge.</p>
                  <p>But now if any one ſhould ſay, That proceeding in this way, we ſcarce touch upon Expectoration, ſo far are we from diſcourſing largely of the ways by which it is to be promoted, through the various Seaſons of the Diſeaſe, he is to know that theſe things were not unwarily paſt over: But after good conſideration deſignedly neglected; for I always thought that they were in very great danger, who committed the Cure of this Diſeaſe to Expectoration; for it often happens that part of the Morbifick Matter being concocted, and perhaps ſpit up, the reſt remains crude; the beſt maturating and expectorating Medicines having been uſed in vain; for ſometimes the Expectora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion goes on very well, and ſometimes is wholly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. The Patient in the mean while being in Jeopardy on every hand, and for any power I have over Expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which indeed is none at all, may be adjudged for Life or Death; whereas on the contrary by Bleeding, the Morbifick Matter is in my power, and the Orifice of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65404:74"/>
Vein may ſupply the uſe of the <hi>Aſpera arteria</hi>; for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently aſſert, that this Diſeaſe, which if it be treated by the Method we have ſpoken againſt, is deſervedly reckon'd among the moſt dangerous, may be as certainly and as ſafely cured, by the Method I have now preſcribed, as any other Diſeaſe whatever; nor could I ever find the leaſt Injury befall any one by ſo large an Evacuation of Blood, though unskilful People think otherwiſe; but for as much as the Cure of this Diſeaſe almoſt wholly conſiſts in Bleeding repeated, which being performed in places far diſtant from populous Towns by unskilful Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and Farriers, Poor People are often in danger of loſing their Arms, and their Lives are hazarded by the Pricking of a Tendon. I thought ſit to add here the Cure of ſuch Punctures when they happen: They whoſe Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons are prick'd do not preſently perceive a Pain, but twelve Hours after Bleeding they complain of it, not ſo much in the Orifice lately made, as in the Parts tending to the Arm-pits, where at length the Pain fixes, and is chiefly perceived when the Arm is extended: But the part hurt has no great Swelling, that ſcarce exceeding the bigneſs of a Hazel-nut; an Ichor continually diſtills from the Orifice, which is the chief ſign of a Puncture of a Tendon, I have known it cured in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of white Lillies four ounces; boil them till they are ſoft in a quart of Cows Milk; then take of Oat-meal, and of the Meal of Flax-ſeeds, each three ounces, boil the Meal to the conſiſtence of a Pultis, in a ſufficient quantity of the Milk ſtrained from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Roots, and mingle the Roots maſh'd; make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm, apply it hot Morning and Evening to the part affected.</hi>

                  <p>As to the Prognoſticks of this Diſeaſe, common Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience does atteſt, that 'tis a very dangerous Diſeaſe; for many either dye of it, or very difficultly recover Health; and this is manifeſt from its Aetiology; for a Wound with a great Extravaſation or Stagnation of Blood made in the Lungs, is very difficultly cured, and the affected place is never reſtored to its Priſtine State.</p>
                  <p>The Prognoſtick Signs which are of chiefeſt note, are taken from appearance of the Symptoms, and from the nature of things evacuated, and from the degrees of Strength.</p>
                  <p>A Peripneumonia coming upon a Pleuriſie or Quinſie, moſt commonly is worſe than when it comes of it ſelf, or ſucceeds either of them. But if upon this Diſeaſe, after what manner ſoever begun, an acute Feaver pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently follows, with great Thirſt, Watchings, and an Orthopnoea; it is ill, and yet much worſe, if a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, or Phrenſie, or Convulſive Motions, or an Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plegia come upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:65404:75"/>Moreover, The Patient is as much indangered if he be very Short-breathed, if he be troubled with Vomiting, or frequent Swooning away, a weak Pulſe, or cold Sweats: For while theſe Symptoms are urgent, the Obſtruction of the Blood in the Lungs is not at all removed, nothing is digeſted or ſpit up; but the Circulation of the Blood being more and more obſtructed, and its Accenſion by Reſpiration hindred, the Animal Spirits are much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered; ſo that at length the Strength is quite ſpent, and the Vital Flame extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſticks from things evacuated, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Peripneumonia to be dangerous when nothing is ſpit up; Next to this, when the Spittle is thin and crude, mixed with Blood; it's far better when the Spittle is yellow and thick, ſtreaked with a little Blood. The Urine being yellow from the beginning, and of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, with a cloud in the midſt, ſhews that almoſt all the Impurities are lodged in the place affected; when from that ſtate it is changed into a thick and turbid Urine, it ſhews that the Morbifick Matter is reſorbed from that part into the Blood: But if ſuch kind of Urine be ſuddenly changed into a thin one, then a Delirium, or Death it ſelf, is at hand. Much Sweat, and plenty of Urine, a Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaea, Bleeding at Noſe; the Flux of the Courſes, or of the Hemorrhoids, are good Signs in this Diſeaſe; yea, any of theſe Evacuations happening ſeaſonably, do frequently diſcharge the Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The condition of Strength is ever of great Moment in making a due Prognoſtick in this Diſeaſe; for oftentimes when there be dreadful Symptoms, as a violent Feaver, a difficulty of Breathing, with a Cough, Watchings, and other ill Signs, if the Pulſe be as yet ſtrong, and the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits vigorous, there is more hope of the Patient, than when theſe things are more ſedate, if the Pulſe be weak, and the Spirits torpid and oppreſs'd.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Indication of Cure in a Peripneumonia, is, That the Blood impacted in the Veſſels of the Lungs, and cauſing Obſtruction and Inflammation, may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed from thence, and reſtored to its wonted Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but if it cannot be done, the ſecond Indication will be, that the Matter be duly digeſted, or ſuppurated, and preſently ſpit up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:65404:76"/>While the former Indication prevails, the Intentions of Healing may be theſe following: Firſt, That the more plentiful Flux of Blood to the part affected be prevented: Secondly, We muſt endeavour that the Blood ſtagnating or extravaſated in the Lungs, be reſorbed again by the Veins into the reſt of the Maſs, and reſtored to Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: And that it may be the better done, the Blood ought thirdly to be freed from its Clammineſs whereby its Fluidity is hindred. Fourthly, We muſt take care of the moſt urgent Symptoms, <hi>viz.</hi> The Feaver, Cough, Watchings, and difficulty of Breathing: But if notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe things, the other Indication ſhall come into uſe; it will be requiſite to preſcribe maturating and expectorating Medicines vulgarly ſo called, together with theſe Remedies juſt mentioned.</p>
                  <p>That we may anſwer the firſt and ſecond Intention together, Bleeding is for the moſt part requiſite in every Peripneumonia, yea, ſometimes it ought to be frequently repeated; for the Veſſels being emptied of Blood, do not only withdraw the Nouriſhment of the Diſeaſe, but do often reſorbe the Matter impacted in the part affected: Wherefore if Strength remain, and the Pulſe be ſtrong enough, large Bleeding is convenient at the very beginning; but otherwiſe let it be uſed in a ſmall quantity; which however may be repeated as occaſion offers it ſelf. It is to be noted, that Blood drawn in a Peripneumonia, and alſo in a Pleuriſie, after it's cold, contains in its Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies a ſmall viſcous and diſcoloured Film. Moreover, we may obſerve one while the Blood entirely bad, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while only part of it is ſubject to this change; for when the Blood is received in three or four Diſhes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in all, but oftner in the ſecond and third Diſh, it is apparently bad, and in the firſt and laſt good enough. Wherefore it is commonly ordered, that the Blood is always to run ſo long, till that which is ſo depraved begins to come forth; and if there be ſufficient Strength, the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out is to be continued till it runs good again: Indeed as frequent Experience does approve of this Practice, ſo doth Reaſon it ſelf; for in this Diſeaſe, ſeeing the whole Maſs of Blood does not preſently acquire that Clammineſs, the depraved Portions are chiefly accumulated about the place of the Obſtruction, and adhere on every ſide in the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65404:76"/>
leſſer Veſſels; wherefore the Blood firſt flowing out by Phlebotomy is often good: Afterwards, the Veſſels being emptied, receive the other Morbifick Stagnating before, and reſtore it to Circulation; and when Portions of it placed near, troop together to the Orifice of the Vein, they flow out together; and after that the corrupted Blood hath flowed out, the reſidue more pure doth ſucceed. Wherefore in this caſe, let Inciſion be ever made with a large Orifice, and let the Blood be drawn out with a large and continued Stream; for otherwiſe, if in the midſt of Bleeding, the bad Blood iſſuing out, the Orifice (as the Manner of ſome is, that the Spirits ſhould not faint) be cloſed with the Finger; when it is opened again, the pure Blood will flow next, but the bad ſliding by, if there be any remaining, will not preſently return to that Orifice. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Phlebotomy, many other Remedies, namely, whatever does repreſs that Urgency of Blood, and empty the Paſſages thereof, are to be uſed, wherefore a very thin Diet is preſcribed, for the moſt part meerly of Barley and Oats; and though Catharticks are altogether prohibited, becauſe they diſquiet the Blood, and hurry it impetuouſly upon the Part affected, yet Gliſters which gently looſen the Belly, and draw the Impurities of the Blood towards the Belly, ought to be daily uſed. Moreover Juleps, and temperating Apozems which reſtrain the Feaver of the Blood, and evacuate the Superfluous Soroſities of it, and gently open the Paſſages of the Breaſt, are uſed with good Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>The third Intention of Healing which reſpects the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the Clammineſs or Obſtructing Viſcoſity of the Blood, is wholly to be performed by Remedies, which unlooſe the Frame thereof too much bound, and diſſolve the Combinations of the Salts, as teſtaceous Powders, the Tooth of a Boar, the Jaws of a Pike, and other things indued with an Alkali Salt, alſo Sal-prunella. I have frequently known the Spirit of Sal-Armoniack, and Harts-horn to have yielded notable Relief in this Diſeaſe, and the Infuſion of Horſe-dung, by reaſon of its volatile Salt is of great uſe, though it be a common Remedy.</p>
                  <p>As to the Symptoms and their Cure, very many Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies appropriated to theſe, fall in together with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for againſt the Feaver the ſame Juleps and Apozems,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65404:77"/>
which appeaſe the Heat of the Blood, and withall recreate the Animal Spirits are to be uſed; to which, in reſpect of the Cough and Difficulty of breathing, temperate pectoral Remedies are added. The greateſt Difficulty is what ought to be exhibited againſt want of Sleep, when it is very urgent; for Opiats becauſe they further the Difficulty of breathing in this Diſeaſe, are ſcarce ſafely taken; yea ſometimes they are very pernicious; wherefore Laudanum, and the ſtrong Preparations of Opium, are to be ſhunned in a Peripneumonia, more than a Dog or a Snake.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, Anodyns and gentle Hypnoticks, as Water and Syrup of Red Poppies are not only allowed, but are accounted Specifick Remedies in this Diſeaſe, and in a Pleuriſie; and ſometimes it will be expedient to uſe Diacodiats, if the Strength be ſufficient, and the Pulſe ſtrong enough; for the Pain of the Breaſt, if at any time it be troubleſome, it is neceſſary to apply Liniments, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, and Cataplaſms.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond curative Indication which intends the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the Matter impacted in the Lungs, (if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſperſed or reſorbed,) and to throw it up by Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle requires ordinary, maturating, and expectorating Medicines that are temperate, ſuch as aſſwage Thirſt, and appeaſe the Feaveriſh Heat. The more ſelect Remedies, that are chiefly accommodated to this Diſeaſe ſhall be now mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The Medicines conducing to the firſt and ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention are preſcribed according to the following Forms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Maries Thiſtle ten ounces, of red Poppies three ounces, of the Syrup of red Poppies one ounce, of Pearls prepared one dram, make a Julep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doſe is ſix Spoonfuls every fourth Hour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Black Cherry Water, of the Water of Carduus Benedictus, and of Baulm, each four ounces, of the Powder of Boars Tooth one dram, of Syrup of Violets ten drams, make a Julep to be taken after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Graſs-roots three ounces, Shavings of Ivory, and Harts-horn, each three drams; Raiſons ſtoned one ounce
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65404:77"/>
and an half, Liquoriſh two drams; boil them in Spring Water, from three Pints to two; to the ſtrained Liquor add, Syrup of Violets one ounce, Sal-prunella one dram; make an Apozem. Take three or four ounces thrice a Day,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſame Intention, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Veſſels being emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied may ſubſtract the Nouriſhment of the Diſeaſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbe the morbifick Matter, Purging is preſcribed by many.</p>
                  <p>The Ancients in this Diſeaſe as in many other, uſed after Phlebotomy, Preparatives and Purgatives in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Courſe; and of late the Chymiſts with greater Boldneſs give Vomits, and prefer them before all other Remedies in Peripneumonia; yea neglecting or forbidding Bleeding, they chiefly depend on Stibiate Vomits, but I think there cannot be a more pernicious Courſe; for though ſometimes they do no hurt in ruſtick and robuſt Bodies, yet they are without Succeſs; but in tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions they are in a manner as deſtructive as Poiſon.</p>
                  <p>But as to Purging, though it may not be convenient at the very Beginning, for indeed it's then moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injurious, yet the Fluxion of the Morbifick Matter being ſtopt, and the Efferveſcence of the Blood being appeaſed, we may ſafely evacuate the Body with a leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Purge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Decoction of Senna gerionis four ounces, of Syrup of Roſes ſolutive one ounce, mingle them, make a Potion.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the beſt Senna three drams, of all the Caſſia, and Tamarinds, each half an ounce; of Coriander Seeds two drams, let them be boiled in a ſufficient Quantity of Fountain Water to ſix ounces; when it is ſtrained add one ounce of Syrup of Violets; let it be clarified with the white of an Egg, and give it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Purgatives are not always to be given, nor ever unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly in this Diſeaſe, but Gliſters are uſed frequently, and moſt commonly daily; they muſt be gentle and emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient, ſuch as eaſily move the Belly, without any great Agitation of the Humours or Blood; for this purpoſe,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65404:78"/>
Milk or Whey is often convenient, with brown Sugar, or Syrup of Violets. <hi>Or,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves of either Sort of Mallows, of Melilot and Mercury, each one handful; of Linſeed, and ſweet Fennel-ſeeds, each half an ounce; of ſweet Prunes Number ſix; boil them in a ſufficient Quantity of Spring water to a Pint, to which add Syrup of Violets one ounce, Sugar ten drams, Sal Prunella one dram, make a Gliſter.</hi>

                  <p>Medicines for the third Intention, <hi>viz.</hi> for diſſolving the Clammineſs of the Blood, are wont to be adminiſtred in the Form of a Powder, of a Spirit, or a Potion, according to the Manner following.</p>

                     <hi>Take Powder of Crabs-eyes, and Sal-prunella, each one dram and an half; of Pearl one dram, Sugar-candy two ſcruples; make a Powder to be divided into eight Doſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, he took as often as he pleaſed a Draught of a pectoral Apozem; by the uſe of theſe within three hours all the Symptoms began to abate, and the Night after he ſweated and ſlept a little; the day after I repeated Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, and then continuing the ſame Remedies, he recovered in four or five Days; the Blood we took from him was always in the Superficies viſcous and diſcoloured.</p>
                  <p>A certain Gentleman of a Sanguine Complexion, and of a ſtrong Habit of Body, after immoderate drinking of Wine, fell into a Feaver with a grievous Peripneumonia, ſo that Heat and Thirſt mightily afflicting him, ſitting always upright in his Bed or Chair, and breathing ſhort and very frequent, he could ſcarce draw in Air enough to ſuſtain the vital Flame; becauſe he could not undergo large Bleeding, I took it away by degrees, twice or thrice day after day; Gliſters were often injected. Moreover, Apozems, and Juleps, alſo Spirit of Sal-armoniack, and Teſtacious Powders were given by turns; within four or five days the Feaver ſome what abated, alſo he began to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65404:80"/>
breath better, and ſometimes to ſleep a little; yet he did always complain of a great Heavineſs of his Breaſt, and of an intolerable Oppreſſion of the Lungs; wherefore when Bleeding was no longer ſafe, I applied very large Bliſters to the Arms and Thighs; the Bliſters on his Arms ſoon dried up, but thoſe on his Legs did not only remain open, but after five or ſix days did run very much, and afterwards almoſt for a Month daily diſcharged great Plenty of a ſharp Ichor; in the mean time his Lungs ſenſibly amended, and at length were freed of their Burden. Laſtly, The little Sores raiſed by the Bliſters were diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly cured, and not without frequent Applications of Medicines.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LVII. Of a Baſtard Peripneumonia.</head>
                  <p>A Feaver accompanied with many Peripneumonick Symptoms, invades yearly about the beginning of Winter, but oftner at the End of it; it chiefly ſeizes thoſe that are of a groſs Habit of Body, and middle aged, or (which oftner happens) thoſe that are older, and too much addicted to Spirituous Liquors, eſpecially to Brandy; for when the Blood in ſuch Men has been burdened with Flegmatick Humours, heapt up in the Winter, and ſtirr'd into a new Motion by the approaching Spring, a Cough is preſently occaſioned by this Means, by which the ſaid Flegmatick Humous ruſh upon the Lungs; at which time, if the Patient chance to live irregularly, and continues to drink freely ſuch ſpirituous Liquors, the Matter growing almoſt thick, which occaſioned the Cough, ſtops the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Lungs, and the Feaver conſumes the Maſs of Blood: At the beginning of the Feaver, the Patient is ſometimes hot and ſometimes cold, is giddy, ond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of a launcing Pain of his Head; when the Cough is violent, he vomits up all liquid things when he coughs, and ſometimes when he does not; the Urin is turpid and very red; the Blood taken away is like that of Pleuriticks;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65404:80"/>
he is often ſhort breath'd: If he cough, his Head akes juſt as if it were cleft in Pieces (for ſo the Patient terms it) there is a Pain of the whole Breaſt, or at leaſt a Preſſure of the Lungs, which is perceived by the Standers by when the Patient coughs; the Lungs not ſufficiently dilating themſelves, the vital Paſſages are as it ſeems ſhut up by the Swelling, and the Circulation on that Account is ſo intercepted, and the Blood ſo ſtopt, that there are no Signs of a Feaver, though this may alſo happen by reaſon of the Plenty of the Flegmatick Matter, by which the Blood is ſo burdened, that it cannot riſe to a perfect Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition, eſpecially in groſs Bodies.</p>
                  <p>In curing this Feaver I count I am oblidged to take away that Blood by Phlebotomy, which occaſions the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation and Inflammation of the Lungs, and to ventilate and open the Lungs with Pectoral Remedies, and to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Heat of the whole Body with a cooling Diet: but whereas on the one hand the Heap of Flegmatick Matter contained in the Veins daily ſupplying Matter for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Lungs, may ſeem to indicate Bleeding often repeated; yet on the other hand I found by the beſt Obſervation I could make, that Bleeding often repeated, has ſucceded very ill in Feavoriſh People of a groſs Habit of Body, eſpecially if they have paſſed the Flower of their Age, and therefore I forbore the Repetition of it; and inſtead of it, uſed frequent Purging, which is well enough ſubſtituted for it, in thoſe that abhor large and often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Bleeding.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I proceeded after this manner: I ordered that the Patient ſhould be blooded in the Arm lying in Bed, and that he ſhould not riſe till two or three Hours after; for all Blood letting ſomewhat weakning and diſordering the whole Body, may by this means the eaſier be born; for the Patient lying a Bed can better bear the taking away of ten ounces, than of ſix or Seaven when he is up; the next day I give the following Potion in the Morning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Caſſia extracted one ounce, of Liquoriſh two drams, of fat Figs number four, of the Leaves of Senna two drams and an half, of Agarick trochiſcated one dram, boil them in a ſufficient Quantity of Water, in four ounces of the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve one ounce of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65404:81"/>
of Syrup of Roſes ſolutive half an ounce, mingle them, make a Potion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day I uſed to bleed a ſecond time; and the next day ſave one, I order the Purging Potion above pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, to be repeated, and to be given every other day till the Patient is quite well; when the Patient does not purge, I adviſe him to uſe a pectoral Decoction, and Oyl of ſweet Almonds, and the like.</p>
                  <p>I forbid the uſe of Fleſh, and the Broth of it, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of all ſpirituous Liquors; in the ſtead of which I allow him for his ordinary drink a Ptiſan of Barley and Liquoriſh, and ſmall Beer, if he deſire it.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, the Baſtard Peripneumonia occaſioned by a great deal of Flegmatick Filth heapt up in the Blood, is to be cured by Bleeding repeated, and by Purging.</p>
                  <p>Though this Baſtard Peripneumonia is ſomething like a dry Aſthma, both as to Difficulty of Breathing, and ſome other Symptoms; yet it is ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed from it; for in this there are manifeſt Signs of a Feaver, and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which never appear in that, though in this kind they are much leſs and obſcurer than thoſe which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a true Peripneumonia.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt carefully obſerve, that 'tis by no means ſafe to forbid the drinking of Spirit of Wine, and ſuch Liquors all of a ſudden, when the Patient has been a while addicted to them, but they muſt be left off Gradually; for there is Danger of a Dropſie from an haſty and abrupt Change, which ought to be obſerved in all Diſeaſes that come on this Occaſion; and ſeeing there has been Mention made of Spirit of Wine, I will ſay by the by, that indeed it ought to be wiſhed that they were either wholly prohibited, or at leaſt uſed for refreſhing the Spirits, and not for extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing them; or that the internal uſe of them was wholly abdicated, and that they ſhould be only uſed by Surgeons, in Fomentations to digeſt Ulcers, or to be applied to Burns, in which Caſe they are better than any other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine yet found out, for they defend the under Skin from Putrefaction, and ſo ſoon perform the Cure (not wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Digeſtion, which requires a conſiderable Time) if a Rag dipt in Spirit of Wine be preſently applyed to the Part hurt, with Scalding Water, Gunpowder, or the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65404:81"/>
like, and moiſtned with the foreſaid Spirit now and then, till the Pain from the Fire be quite gone, and afterwards only twice a day.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LVIII. Of an Empyema.</head>
                  <p>AN Empyema is a Collection of Matter within the Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Breaſt, whereby the Organs of Reſpiration are oppreſſed. This Collection of Matter is occaſioned either by a Pleuriſie, Peripneumonia, or Angina, ſuppura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and broken.</p>
                  <p>The Signs of an Empyema, either ſhew it is coming, or that it is already perfectly formed. Of the former kind are theſe Diſeaſes going before, from whence this uſually ariſes, as a Pleuriſie, Peripneumonia, and Angina; and ſometimes alſo a Bruiſe or Wound in the Breaſt, and ſometimes alſo other Diſeaſes not well carried off; from whence there will be a greater Suſpicion of an Empyema, if after a Week or two paſſed without plentiful Spitting, Shaking and a Feaver, and Faintneſs of the Spirits ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene; and then after fourteen or twenty Days, the Signs of a confirmed Empyema will appear, <hi>viz.</hi> Difficulty of Breathing, a Weight upon the Breaſt, Fluctuation of the Matter, an uneaſineſs from Motion, Thirſt, and almoſt always a ſmall Feaver, Redneſs of the Cheeks, Reſtleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Watching.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure of an Empyema, you muſt firſt conſider whether the Signs of its being already made be certain or dubious; in the former Caſe there is not much uſe of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; but the Body being well prepared, we muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently open the Side; wherefore if from a Pleuriſie, or a Peripneumonia not well cured, or if by reaſon of Blood extravaſated by a Blow, a Fall, or Wound, a Fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pus, of Purulent or Bloody Matter be perceived, and the Spittle leſſened, or none at all, it is to no purpoſe to waſt Time in uſing expectorating and maturating Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; but having looſned the Belly, and attemperated
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65404:82"/>
the Blood and Humours, by Juleps, Apozems, and Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyns, an Aperrion muſt be undertaken, either by the Knife, or in tender and timerous People by applying a Cauſtick betwixt the ſixth or ſeventh Vertebra; and when the Eſchar is made, we muſt divide it gently with a Knife, and paſs the Knife gently into the Cavity of the Breaſt; then having put in a Silver Pipe, the Matter muſt be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by degrees; but it muſt be let out as haſtily as the Strength of the Patient will permit; for that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains within, will ſtink horridly in a few days; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which a cleaning and Traumatick Liquor muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, with a Syringe twice or thrice a day. It is not neceſſary to deſcribe particularly the Manner of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it being well known, and often practiced by skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chirurgions, and daily practiced. After it is cut open and dreſſed as it ought to be, there is little more to be done by the Phyſician. An exact Courſe of Diet, a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Looſning of the Belly (ſo oft as there is Occaſion) by Gliſters, and alſo theſe Remedies, which are Vulgarly called Traumatick, which do hinder the Diſſolution of the Blood, and keeps the Sereſities of it from falling upon the Breaſt to hurt it, ought to be preſcribed. But if the Signs of this Diſeaſe are uncertain, or altogether doubtful, the Breaſt ought not to be opened too ſoon or raſhly. I have known ſome have their Breaſts opened to no purpoſe, when they have ſpit ſtinking Pus, and they have alſo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under a Dyſpnaea, and a Difficulty of Breathing; therefore when an Empyema is not evident by Pathogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Signs, Medicines (ſuch as are preſcribed for the Cure of a Peripneumonia) which help Expectoration, and evacuate gently by Sweat and Urine, ought to be uſed for ſome time: If theſe do not any Good, and the Empyema ſtill remains, or Augments, then the Breaſt muſt be opened.</p>
                  <p>As to the Forms of the Medicines requiſite for the Cure of an Empyema before Section, the ſame Remedies which were preſcribed for a Peripneumonia, are to be uſed: but after the opening of the Breaſt the following are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>To prevent Fainting which may happen either in the Operation or after it, the following Julep muſt be in Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and four or five Spoonfuls of it muſt be taken upon occaſion.</p>

                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:65404:82"/>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Balm, and Black Cherries, each ſix ounces; of Aqua-mirabilis one ounce, of Pearl powdered one dram, of Syrup of Gilly-flowers one ounce, mingle them, make a Julep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following Decoction muſt be taken twice or thrice in a day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves of Harts-tongue, Speedwell, Hemp, Agrimony, Colts-foot, Mouſe-ear, Sanicle, each one handful; of the Roots of Madder, and Chervil, each one ounce; of Barley half an ounce, of red Cicers half an ounce, Raiſons of the Sun one ounce and an half; boil them in two Quarts of Fountain-water till half is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, ſweeten it with Clarified Honey, or with the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Mouſe-ear as it is taken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there be no Feaver the following Pills may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>

                  <head>CHAP. LIX. Of a Conſumption.</head>
                  <p>A Phthyſis in general, is a Conſumption of the Muſcular Parts of the Body: It is twofold, either Original or Sympromatick. There are two Species of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Phthyſis, <hi>viz.</hi> Atrophia, and a Conſumption of the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>An Atrophia is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> Either Nervous, or ariſing from Inanition.</p>
                  <p>A Symptomatick Phthyſis is occaſioned by other Diſeaſes going before.</p>
                  <p>An Atrophy, or Nervous Phthyſis, is a Conſumption of the whole Body, without any conſiderable Feaver, Cough, or difficulty of Breathing, but loſs of Appetite and Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion accompany it; upon which account Faintneſs, and a daily waſting of the Body follow. This ſort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption ſometimes happens in <hi>England,</hi> but very often to the Inhabitants of <hi>Virginia,</hi> when they return hither.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this Diſeaſe, the Body appears Oedematous, the Face Pale and Squalid, and the Stomach nauſeates every thing but Liquors; and the Strength is ſo languid, that the Sick, before the Fleſhy parts are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conſumed, is rendred ſo very Weak, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep from Bed, the colour of the Urine is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of a deep Red, and very little in quantity, though ſometimetimes (but rarely, as it is wont to happen in Diſeaſes of the Nerves) it is pale, and voided in a great quantity; but no conſiderable Feaver can be diſcerned, either by the Pulſe, Drouth, or Heat, how high-coloured ſoever the Urine is; ſo that the Pathognomonick Signs of this Conſumption beginning, are Faintneſs and want of Appetite, without any notable Feaver, Cough, or ſhort Breath; though in progreſs of the Diſeaſe, when the habit of the Body is waſted, ſome difficulty of Breathing (as is uſual in all that are Faint) may be perceived.</p>
                  <p>This Diſeaſe is very difficultly cured, if the Phyſician be not made uſe of at firſt; it ends in an Hydropical and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65404:83"/>
Oedematous Tumour of the Body, eſpecially of the lower parts, and then the Diſeaſe is paſt all hope.</p>
                  <p>The main of the buſineſs muſt be performed by Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machick Medicines, and ſuch as ſtrengthen the Nerves, ſuch are Chalybeats, Antiſcorbuticks, and Cephalicks, and bitter things of every kind: For Inſtance, Let the Sick take, if his Body be bound, four Ounces of the bitter Decoction with Senna, and every fourth night two Ounces of Tinctura Sacra, or of the Tinctura of Hiera Picra, made in the Waters of Rue, Black Cherries, Compound Peony.</p>
                  <p>In his ordinary Drink, hang a Bag of Cephalicks, and Antiſcorbuticks; an hour before Dinner let him take half a Dram of Elixir Proprietatis in a Draught of Whitewine, wherein Wormwood has been infuſed: Apply to the Region of the Stomach the Magiſterial Stomachick Plaiſter, with a few drops of the Chymical Oyl of Cinnamon and Wormwood; or foment the Stomach daily with Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Bags, made of the Leaves of Mint and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Cinnamon, Mace, Zedoary, Galingal, Cyperus, and Sweet-ſmelling Flag, and boil'd in Claret: If it be Summer-time, let him drink Chalybeat Waters; if Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Syrup of Steel or the Wine of it, made by quenching Filings of Steel in good Whitewine three or four times; then by infuſing in it Zedoary, Galingal, Nutmegs, ſharp Cinnamon, Mace, Cubebs, and Cloves groſly beaten: But amongſt Chalybeats, Mynſichts extract is thought the beſt, which muſt be given in the form of a Bole, or of Pills, for the ſpace of twenty or thirty days. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Extract of Mynſicht half a ſcruple, Balſam of Gilead ſeven drops, of </hi> Haly's <hi>Powder ſix grains, of the Compound Powder of Wake-Robin four grains, of the Powder of Liquoriſh a ſufficient quantity; make Pills of an ordinary ſize, repeat them every day once.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Opobalſamum by it ſelf, as alſo Spirit of Harts-horn, and Spirit of Sal-armoniack, are very effectual in this caſe, becauſe they are agreeable to the Nerves. For Inſtance, Let the Sick take eight or ten drops of Opobalſam, or of Spirit of Harts-horn, in a ſufficient quantity of Sugar-candy.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65404:84"/>
Let him endeavour to make himſelf Chearful by Exerciſe and Company; for this Diſeaſe moſt commonly proceeds from Care and Sorrow; and let him live in a good and open Air: And becauſe the Stomach is chiefly affected in this Diſeaſe, he muſt eat a delicate ſort of Meat, and not be too long accuſtomed to any one.</p>
                  <p>The Conſumption that proceeds from Innanition is next to be diſcourſed of; and firſt, Of that which proceeds from an Hemorrhage, whither by the Noſtrils, or from the Lungs by Coughing, or from the Jaws by Hawking, or from the Stomach by Vomit, or from the Reins by Urine, or from the Hemorrhoidal or Uterin Veſſels in the cuſtomary monthly Purgation, or from hard Labour; or laſtly, from Wounds when there has been a great and long Flux of Blood. In this caſe the Hemorrhage muſt be firſt ſtopt by thickning Remedies, and by binding hard the extream parts; and if there be occaſion, and the Sick have Strength, Bleeding muſt be uſed frequently, but ſparingly; you muſt apply, if the part will admit of it, <hi>Galen</hi>'s Stiptick Plaiſter, the Royal Stiptick Water, Oxycrat cold, Ink, Aſhes of Hair a little burnt in a Retort, and with Vinegar made up in the form of a Cataplaſm, true Bole, Dragons blood, and the like; and they muſt be often renewed.</p>
                  <p>Let the Sick take inwardly three or four times a day twenty or thirty drops, or more, of the Royal Stiptick-water, in a Draught of the Milk-water, and five or ſix Spoonfuls of the clarified Juices of Plantane and Nettles; or let him take frequently in a Spoon the following Linctus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Syrup of Purſlain three ounces, of true Bole, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons blood, of the Troches of Spodium, and of ſealed Earth, each two ſcruples; of Japan Earth one dram, of Gum-Tragacanth a ſufficient quantity diſſolved in Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane-water; mingle them, make a Linctus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or let him take thrice a day the quantity of a Nutmeg of the following Electuary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Conſerve of red Roſes one ounce, of the Troches of Ambar three drams, of true Bole, and of Dragons
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65404:84"/>
blood, each half a dram; with Syrup of Myrtles make an Electuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let him take alſo every night at Bed-time five or ſix Spoonfuls of the following Julep, ſhaking the Viol when he uſes it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Plantane-water ſix ounces, of Cinnamon-water hordeated three ounces, of diſtilled Vinegar half an ounce, of true Bole, and of Dragons blood, each half a dram; of London Laudanum three grains, of Syrup of Myrtles one ounce and an half; make a Julep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Flux of Blood being ſtopt, we muſt endeavour by all means to raiſe the weak Blood with new and good Chyle, and to extinguiſh the Febrile Flame, if it be begun, leaſt a Conſumption ſhould follow; wherefore the Sick muſt be frequently nouriſhed with good Broths, and variety of Meats that are full of Nouriſhment, and of eaſie Digeſtion, and pleaſant to the Stomach; but he muſt be ſure to abſtain from Wine, and from things ſalted and ſpiced; and becauſe this ſort of Sick, and all other that are inclining to a Conſumption, are ſubject to Anger, Sorrow, Oppreſſions of the Hypochonders, Hyſterick Paſſions, and want of Appetite; upon which account they can neither eat plentifully, nor digeſt well: They muſt endeavour to recreate themſelves, and to take the Benefit of a wholſome and free Air, which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly does more good than Medicines.</p>
                  <p>But if the Sick be Hectick, the Peruvian bark given freely is of admirable Vertue; and if there be occaſion the Sick muſt uſe a Milk Diet, or Chalybeat Waters; but you muſt by no means Looſen the Body.</p>
                  <p>A Conſumption alſo often ariſes from a ſimple Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaea, and the Whites; alſo from Impoſthumes and large Ulcers, and alſo from giving Suck, from a Looſneſs and Dyſentery, from a Diabetes, from Salivation, a Dropſie, violent Sweating, and the like.</p>
                  <p>But a Conſumption of the Lungs is the chief: The Cauſe in general of it, is an ill Diſpoſition of the whole Maſs of Blood, and of the Nervous Spirit, contracted by degrees by the various Procatarctick Cauſes, whereby the

Acrid and Malignant Serum of the Blood ſeparated by the ſoft and glandulous Paranchyma of the Lungs, ſtuffs and inflames them, and at laſt cauſes Ulcers, which is indeed the containing Cauſe of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The Procatarctick Cauſes are firſt, a Suppreſſion of the uſual and neceſſary Evacuations, as of the Courſes, the Lochia, of old Ulcers, of Iſſues, of Sweat by the Soles of the Feet, and other parts of the Body, and the like, without correcting and removing the Cauſes on which they depend; whereby the Blood is vitiated. Secondly, Great Paſſions of the Mind, eſpecially Fear, Sorrow, Anger, deep Thinking, unſeaſonable and too hard Study, and the like. Thirdly, Eating and Drinking too much, and unſeaſonably, eſpecially Drinking too much of Wine and Spirituous Liquors. Fourthly, Neglect of due Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. Fifthly, Long Watching. Sixthly, Marſhy and groſs Air, and Smoak of Coals. Seventhly, An Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Diſpoſition. Eighthly, An ill Conformation of the Breaſt. Ninthly, Contagion. Tenthly, Stones generated Preternaturally in the Lungs. Eleventhly, Particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which corrupt the Blood and Spirits.</p>
                  <p>By theſe and ſuch-like Procatarctick Cauſes, the Body being prediſpoſed for a Conſumption, the Diſeaſe takes its riſe immediately from taking Cold.</p>
                  <p>For the Cure of an original Conſumption of the Lungs, Blood muſt be drawn from the Arm, eſpecially if the Sick be Plethorick, or accuſtomed a long while to Blood-letting, and let ſix, ſeven, eight or ten Ounces be taken away. Secondly, It is requiſite after Bleeding, eſpecially if the Diſeaſe took its riſe from a Surfet, or is accompanied with Nauſeouſneſs, or a Diſpoſition to Vomiting, to give a gentle Vomit of Honey, or of Oxymel of Squills, and ſometimes of the Vinum Benedictum in a moderate quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity: The Vomit, eſpecially if the Sick bear it well, and if it be neceſſary, may be repeated three or four times at the diſtance of three or four days betwixt each Vomit: It is beſt to give the Vomit towards the Evening, the Sick being blooded the day before; and at Bed-time after every Vomit you muſt give an Anodyn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Honey of Squills half an ounce, give it in a Draught of Poſſet-drink, and repeat twice or thrice in an hour, if the Sick does not Vomit enough.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:65404:85"/>This is proper for Children and young People.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oxymel of Squills, and of Oyl of Sweet-Almonds, each one ounce; mingle them, let the Sick, take it in a large Draught of Poſſet-drink, and let it be repeated twice or thrice in an hour if there be occaſion.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Vinum Benedictum ſeven drams, Syrup of Violets two drams; mix them and make a Potion for Vomiting. And, if it be needful, you may give of Oxymel of Squills and Oyl of Sweet-Almonds, each half an ounce, in a Draught of Poſſet-drink twice or thrice, in the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Salt of Vitriol is not at all convenient in this caſe, becauſe it irritates and pricks continually the Glandulous parts about the Jaws, and ſo promotes the Flux of the Serum, and increaſes the Cough. After the Vomit hath done working, give the following Opiat or the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pectoral Decoction clarified four ounces, of Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Saffron two drams, of </hi> Helmont's <hi>liquid Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num fifteen drops, of Syrup of Violets two drams; mingle them, make a Draught; or you may give ten grains of the Pill of Hounds-tongue, or of Storax.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is convenient to Purge gently by Stool the Humours by Stomachick Purges, and the like, which the leaſt agitate the Blood. For Inſtance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of choice Manna, and of Oyl of Sweet-Almonds, each one ounce and an half, or two ounces; diſſolve them in a Pint of hot Ptiſan; let the Sick drink half in Bed, and the rest half an hour after when he is up.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the beſt Senna two drams, of Caſſia with the Canes broke, and of Tamarinds, each half an ounce; of the Seeds of Coriander prepared half a dram; boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Fountain or </hi> Barnet <hi>water to eight ounces; diſſolve in it an ounce of Manna, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65404:86"/>
half a dram of Sal-prunella: Let the Sick take half in the Morning, and the reſt half an hour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And every Night after Purging give an Opiate to aſſwage the Blood, and to quiet the Lungs, leaſt a new Flux of Humours ſhould fall upon the Lungs by the Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Blood occaſioned by the Purge.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame reaſon it is proper to mix ſome Opiate with Stomachick Purges to be taken at Bed Time. For Inſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Aloes-roſat one ſcruple, or twenty five grains, of the Pills of Hounds-tongue half a Scruple; mingle them make four Pills to be gilded, which are to be repeated every other Night after the Patient hath been blooded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Pills are vulgarly called <hi>Pilulae Catarrhales</hi> by the Apothecaries; for they do not only evacuate the Humours by Stool, but alſo hinder a new Flux of them to the Lungs. Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Stomachick Pills, with Gums, Aleophagin of Maſtich, or of Ambar, half a dram, or two ſcruples; of London Laudanum one grain; mingle them, make four Pills, gild them, and let them be taken every third Night for thrice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if the Catarrh be very violent, and if a Difficulty of Breathing, or a ſtraitneſs on the Breaſt does not ariſe from the Uſe of Opiates, an Opiat muſt be given every Night; for at the beginning of this Diſeaſe nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable can be done without them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In this State of the Diſeaſe, Diaphorecticks do much Good; but you muſt take notice, that they muſt be never uſed before Bleeding, Vomiting and Purging, if they are neceſſary, and they muſt be always mixed with Opiates, and ſuch muſt be choſen as are leaſt hot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of venice-treacle half a dram or two ſcruples, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of old red Roſes half a dram; mingle them, make a Bolus.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:65404:86"/>
                     <hi>Take of Diaſcordium, and conſerve of Wood-ſorrel, each one dram, make a Bolus.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of</hi> Matthew's <hi>Pill fifteen grains; make two Pills, gild them, and let them be taken at bed-time.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pill of Hounds-tongue twelve grains, of Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick Antimony one ſcruple, of Tincture of Saffron a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient quantity; mingle them, make four Pills.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Diaphoreticks muſt be taken at Bed-time, and great Care muſt be taken that the Sick does not take Cold after the uſe of them: Bliſters muſt alſo be applyed to the Arms, and betwixt the Shoulders, and Pectoral Medicines muſt be uſed when the Sick does not Purge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oyl of ſweet Almonds, of Syrup of Maiden-hair, of Jujubs, Violets, or of Marſh-mallows, each one ounce and an half; of White Sugar-candy one dram and an half; mingle them exactly, whereof let the Sick take a Spoonful every fourth Hour, drinking upon it four ounces of the following Apozem hot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pectoral Decoction clarified one Pint and an half, of Tincture of Saffron extracted with treacle-water, of Syrup of Maiden-hair, Scabious, or of Jujubs, each one ounce; mingle them, make an Apozem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you deſire to have a more thickning Linctus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of freſh Oyl of ſweet Almonds, of Syrups of Comfrey, of red-poppies, of dried Roſes, each one ounce and an half; of Diacodium half an ounce, of Sugar of Roſes one dram and an half; mingle them, make a Linctus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you wou'd have a more lubricating Linctus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of freſh Oyl of Flax extracted without Fire, of Syrup of Liquoriſh, and of Honey of Violets, one ounce and an half; of white Sugar-candy one dram and an half, mingle them exactly, make a Linctus.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:65404:87"/>If there be a Feaver, omit the Hiſſop and Tincture of Saffron; if there be a Looſneſs, uſe the following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Lohoch of the Lungs of a Fox, of Colts-foot, and Purſlain, each one ounce; of Syrup of Jujubs, and Maiden-hair, each one ounce and an half; of Flowers of Sulphur two drams, of Tincture of Saffron half an ounce, of the Species Diatragacanth frigid, of Diamargit frigid, of the Powder of</hi> Haly, <hi>each one dram; of Penediat Sugar half an ounce; mingle them, make a Linctus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Tacamahaca, of Balſam of Peru, each one Drain; of the Ingredients for the Pectoral Decoction a ſufficient quantity, boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Fountain Water to a Pint and an half; with the ſtrained Liquor, and with a dram of each of the four Cold-ſeeds, with the Seeds of white Poppies, and of Henbane, each two drams; and with eight Almonds blanched, make an Emulſion to be ſweetned with Pendiat-Sugar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if by reaſon of the Clammineſs of the Flegm the Difficulty of Breathing is more than uſual, the following Linctus muſt be preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Lohoch of Raiſons, and of Squills, each one ounce and an half; of Syrup of Hedge-muſtard, of Hyſſop, and of Hore-hound, each one ounce and an half; of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies Diaireos, Diacalaminth, and the Flowers of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, each one Dram and an half; Tincture of Saffron half an ounce, of white Sugar-candy ſix Drams; mingle them, make a Linctus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if this Symptom be very violent, a dram of pure Gum-ammoniack, and a dram and an half of Flowers of Benzoin may be added.</p>
                  <p>And for theſe Intentions, Balſamick Medicines, with things that agglutinate are proper. For Inſtance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pulp of the conſerve of red Roſes, and Wood-ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, each one ounce and an half; of Olibanum three drams, of Opobalſam two ſcruples; mingle them, make an Electuary, whereof let the Sick take the quantity of a

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves of Millfoil, Mouſe-car, Burnet, Dande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, ſpotted Lungwort, Scabious, each one handful; of the Flowers of St. John's-wort, Violets, the greater Daiſy, red Poppies, each half an handful; of Jujubs, and Dates, each ſix Pair; of Saffron tied up in a Rag half a dram, of the Seeds of Anniſe, and Juniper-berries, each three drams; infuſe them, and boil them in a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of Fountain-water to three Pints, in the hot Liquor ſtrained diſſolve four ounces of Conſerve of red Roſes, which being added to the Apozem render it Balſamick and Pleaſantly taſted; ſtrain it again, and add of the Syrups of Coral, and of Oak of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and of Maiden-hair, each one ounce, make an Apozem.</hi>

                  <p>Or inſtead of the foregoing Electuary the following may be ſubſtituted,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pulp of the conſerve of red Roſes two ounces, of the conſerve of Hips one ounce, of the Powder of </hi> Haly <hi>one dram, of</hi> Lucatellus's <hi>Balſam half an ounce, of Balſamick Syrup a ſufficient quantity; mingle them, make an Electuary to be taken as before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Sick take often in a day one or two Spoonfuls of the Balſamick Syrup, which is very agreeable to the Stomach, and with every Doſe of the Syrup, a ſcruple of the Balſam of Tolu made into ſmall Pills, may be taken; and every Night at Bed-time the Sick may take twenty five or thirty drops of <hi>Helmont</hi>'s liquid Laudanum in a ſpoonful of Balſamick Syrup: When there are no other Medicines to be taken, and there is nothing contrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates it, it is alſo very effectual to preſcribe a dram of Flowers of Sulphur to be taken in a rear Egg, or Honey of Roſemary-flowers.</p>
                  <p>If a Tickling Cough, by reaſon of the Acrimony and Thinneſs of the Humuor, iſſuing from the Windpipe and Bronchia, be very troubleſome to the Patient, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tablets muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Cough continues long, and is violent, and will not yield to the foregoing Remedies, we muſt uſe Balſamicks. For Inſtance, Let the Sick take thrice a day three of the following Pills, in a ſpoonful or two of ſome proper Linctus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Powder of Millepedes prepared three drams, of Gum-ammoniack well purified one dram and an half, of the Flowers of Benzoin two ſcruples or one dram, of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Saffron, and Peruvian Balſam, each half a ſcruple; of Balſam of Sulphur aniſated, or made with Turpentine, a ſufficient Quantity; mingle them, make Pills of a moderte bigneſs, gild them, or cover them with Powder of Liquoriſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Pills have often done good in Conſumptire Coughs.</p>
                  <p>The Sick muſt chuſe an Air that is moderately hot and dry, and ſomewhat thin; the diet muſt be of eaſie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, as Mutton, and Veal, and the like; and the Sick muſt eat Fleſh only at Dinner; at Supper he muſt only eat Water-gruel, Panada-broths, potched Eggs, and the like; and he muſt be ſure to be moderate in his Diet; he muſt drink ſparingly of ſmall Beer, and the like; Wines muſt be avoided, and other ſpirituous Liquors; it is alſo convenient that his Beer be medicated with Pectoral things and the like, which are proper for the Diſeaſe; for by this means a great quantity of Medicines will be mixed with the Blood without nauſeating the Stomach, or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Appetite, which a Phyſician ought to take great Care of. For Inſtance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the beſt Sarſa-parilla cut eight ounces, of the Roots of China ſliced four ounces, of Polypody of the Oak, Maiden-hair, Ground-ivy, ſpotted Lung-wort, Colts-foot, Scabious, Oak of </hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>each two handfuls; of the

                  </p>
                  <p>The Sick muſt exerciſe himſelf daily moderately, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially before Dinner; he muſt take great Care that he does not catch Cold: The Sick muſt be diverted as much as may be from Anger, Sorrow, deep thinking, and all other great Paſſions of the Mind; from Study, and unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Watching, always ſleeping, if he can, the firſt part of the Night.</p>
                  <p>But in the ſecond State of this Diſeaſe, which may be known by the Increaſe of the hectick Feaver, which now is often like a putrid Intermitting Feaver, and by the manifeſt waſting of the Fleſh, by the dry Cough, a Weight upon the Breaſt, and difficulty of Breathing; all Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations by Stool, Vomit, or Sweat, are injurious; for they promote the Feaver, and Increaſe the Conſumption: Nor is Bleeding to be uſed at this time, unleſs it be to prevent a Peripneumonia; but the Alteratives and Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals before preſcribed muſt be uſed frequently, as often as the Stomach will bear them; but eſpecially the uſe of the Balſamicks before preſcribed muſt be long continued, if there be no conſiderable Feaver; and by this means many Conſumptive People have been recovered.</p>
                  <p>Iſſues are alſo of uſe, and the Shaving of the Head.</p>
                  <p>And if the Hectick heat be but ſmall, the Sick ought to drink Calybeat Waters in the Summer-time; for by this means many have been relieved Year after Year; their Stomack, Fleſh and Strength recovered, and the Hectick Heat and Cough left them, and their Breath has been freer: But theſe Waters are not to be uſed when the Lungs are evidently putrified, or when the Fleſh is very much waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Colloquative Sweats, a Looſneſs, or a Dropſie, for then they are deadly. And when they are proper, the Sick muſt uſe them the greateſt part of the Summer, but not ſo great a quantity at a time as is uſual in other Caſes, two Quarts, five Pints, or three Quarts, may be ſufficient
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65404:89"/>
at a time; and the Sick muſt take Care that he does not catch Cold, and of Errors in Diet: Purging is not to be uſed during the drinking of the Waters in this Caſe, but if the Body be ſubject to be bound, the Purging Mnieral-waters muſt be taken three or four times, at the diſtance of three or four Days before and after the uſe of the Caly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat-waters. If the Waters do not paſs well by Urine, or if they cauſe a Diarrhea, you muſt not continue the uſe of them long, unleſs theſe Inconveniences may be remedied by Art, to take off or to prevent the Diarrhea.</p>
                  <p>I uſe to preſcribe the quantity of a Walnut of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Electuary, to be taken at Bed-time every Night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pulp of the conſerve of old red Roſes, of the Electuary of Quinces, each half an ounce; of the Troebes of Ambar three drams, of true Bole, of Dragons-blood, each half a dram; of London Laudanum three grains, of Syrup of Mirtles a ſufficient Quantity; mingle them, make an Electuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To force the Urine, I order that a ſcruple of the whiteſt Salt of Ambar, well cleanſed from the Oyl, ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the firſt Draught of Water.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo good, during the Courſe of the Water, to medicate the ordinary Drink with a Bag of Pectoral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, If the Hectick Feaver be conſiderable, it is ſafer to attemperate the Blood by a Milk-Diet; but as to a Milk Diet what followeth muſt be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, In the uſe of this Diet, nothing but Milk, or things made of Milk, Bread only excepted, muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of; but good Quantities of it muſt be taken fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, leaſt by reaſon of the Thinneſs of it, the Parts ſhould be deprived of their due Nouriſhment. Secondly, This ſort of Diet muſt be continued for the Space of a Month or two. Thirdly, Spring time is moſt ſeaſonable for a Milk Courſe, for then the Herbs and Flowers, wherewith the Beaſts are fed, flouriſh moſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, But if by reaſon of the Ferment of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach being too acid, common Milk, as it ſometimes happens, curdles, and ſo cannot be concocted; upon which account, Vomiting, Grips, and a Looſneſs follow;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65404:89"/>
it is better to abſtain from the uſe of it, and to endeavour to attemperate the Blood with Aſſes-milk: Concerning the uſe of which obſerve the following Directions. Firſt, Give this Milk in the Morning, and let the Sick ſleep a little in Bed afterwards; let it be given again at five in the Afternoon. Secondly, Nothing of a contrary Nature, whether Diet or Medicine muſt be taken till the Milk is concocted. Thirdly, You muſt give a Pint, or half a Pint at a time, or thereabout; for a great Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this, or of common Milk, can neither be received nor concocted by the Stomach, but is uſually caſt out preſently, either by Vomit or Stool, to the great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Sick; wherefore it is prudently ordered by Phyſicians, that as the Stomach is by degrees accuſtomed to this ſort of Diet, ſo the quantity of it ſhould be daily increaſed from half a Pint to a Pint.

                  <p>Prepared Coral, Millepedes, Pearls, Crabs-eyes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, the Simple Powder of Crabs-claws, and other teſtaceous Medicines taken plentifully, and often in a day, are good to blunt the Acrimony of the Blood.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LX. Of Swooning or Fainting.</head>
                  <p>THe next and immediate Cauſe of this Diſeaſe, is a Defect of the Vital Spirits; and this Defect of the Spirits chiefly happens four ways, Either becauſe there is not a ſufficient quantity of them generated, or becauſe they are diſſipated and evacuated when they are generated; or they are preternaturally altered, and corrupted: Or laſtly, They are ſuffocated and overwhelmed. They are not generated either by reaſon of a Fault of the Faculty, or of the Matter; the Faculty of the generating the Spirits is hurt, either by a Peculiar Diſorder of the Heart or by Conſent.</p>
                  <p>The peculiar Diſeaſes of the Heart that are chiefly to to be taken Notice of, are great Intemperies overturning the native Temper of it; or deſtroying the Subſtance of the Parts, and of the Native Heat; as acute and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Feavers, Colliquative, Peſtilential and Hectick Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, alſo Organical Diſeaſes, as Conſtriction and too great Dilatation.</p>
                  <p>The Faculty of the Heart is hurt by Conſent, as from the Brain and Liver, which have a great Sympathy with it; and alſo often from the Mouth of the Stomach, by reaſon of its nearneſs and Exquiſite Senſe, upon which account Swooning is divided into Cardiack and Stomachick; that is Cardiack which proceeds from the Heart being Primarily affected; that is Stomachick which is produced by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Stomach: It alſo often ariſes from the Womb, by reaſon of ill Vapours tranſmitted thence to the Heart.</p>
                  <p>The Fault of the Matter, is a Defect or Corruption of the Air and Blood, from whence the Vital Spirits are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated. A Defect of the Air happens from Reſpiration or Tranſpiration hurt: A Defect of the Blood from a Fault in Nutrition.</p>
                  <p>The Corruption of both is occaſioned by putting on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quality; ſo from the infected Air in a Peſtilential Conſtitution, Swooning and Fainting frequently happen,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65404:97"/>
and ſome ill Smells occaſion the ſame, and ſweet Smells in ſome Women.</p>
                  <p>The Blood is alſo often corrupted by unwholeſome Food.</p>
                  <p>Too large Evacuations diſſipate the Spirits, both ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inſenſible: ſenſible Evacuatioins, are firſt of Blood it ſelf by the Mouth, Noſtrils, Womb, Belly, Hemorrhoids, Bleeding, and great Wounds. Secondly, of other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which though they are Excrementitious, yet being evacuated in a large quantity, they diſſipate the Spirits and occaſion Fainting. Such Humours are w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nt to be evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by Vomit, Stool, Urine, Sweat, by opening a large Abſceſs, eſpecially inwardly, as of an Empyema; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo outwardly, as in a Dropſie, the Navel being open.</p>
                  <p>Inſenſible Evacuations are made by too great a rarity of the Skin, and by reaſon of Thinneſs or Acrimony of things contained, by immoderate Heat, Bathing and exceſſive Labour.</p>
                  <p>They are alſo diſſipated by long, Watching, long Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, immoderate Venery, Anger or exceſſive Joy; long and acute Sickneſs, violent Pains of the Heart, Stomach, Bowels, Veins, Ears, Teeth, and of all the Nervous Parts.</p>
                  <p>The Spirits are altered and corrupted by an ill Diſpoſition of the Bowels, and by any thing that has a malignant and an inimical Quality to the Heart; as a venomous and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Air drawn in by the Breath, or generated in the Body by Putrefaction of Humours; Poiſon taken inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does the ſame, and the Biting of Venomous Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, A violent Reflux of the Spirits and Blood to the Heart, and the like, ſuffocates and overwhelms the Vital Spirits. A noble Virgin, which was very ſubject to faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon every ſmall occaſion, died ſuddenly, by reaſon of a ſudden Reflux of the Blood, and Spirits to the Heart, as ſhe was about to ſign a Contract of Marriage with a very handſom and accompliſhed Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>Fainting alſo ſometimes happens from cold and thick Blood, heapt up in abundance in the greater Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, it muſt be varied according to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the Cauſes; but from whatever Cauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, that which follows muſt be obſerved in the Fit, You muſt lay them on their Back, and ſprinkle Water in their

Faces, and provoke Sneezing; put ſome good Wine or Cinnamon-water into their Mouths; apply Bread hot out of the Oven to their Noſtrils; call them aloud, ſhake them, pull them by the Noſe, double their Fingers, pull their Hair, uſe Frictions, Ligatures and Cupping-glaſſes.</p>
                  <p>But the Cure muſt be varied according to the Variety of the Cauſes in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>If it takes its Riſe from want of Nouriſhment, the Sick muſt be refreſhed with good Wine, and by a Piece of Bread dipt in it and eaten, and alſo by nouriſhing Broths, and the like.</p>
                  <p>If by reaſon of the Thinneſs of the Humours, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits exhale, Perfumes and meat of good Juice and Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning muſt be preſcribed, and the Pores of the Skin muſt be ſtopt with Oyl of Roſes and by the cold Air.</p>
                  <p>If it proceed from an Hyſterick Diſeaſe, Remedies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for that muſt be given; if from a malignant Quality Cardiacks and Alexipharmicks muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>If from taking Poyſon, things that evacuate muſt be uſed; a Vomit muſt be given, and afterwards Treacle muſt be preſcribed; and then if a Heat and Eroſion of the Stomach be perceived, he muſt take Milk or Butter, or fat Broths, or cooling Cordial Potions.</p>
                  <p>If from Immoderate Evacuation, the Sick muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with Perfumes, Meat and Drink, Sleep and Reſt.</p>
                  <p>If from too great a Loſs of Blood, lay the Sick on a Bed with his Head downward, Sprinkle his Face with cold Water, give him a little Wine diluted with cold Water.</p>
                  <p>If by over-purging, give new Treacle; or for want of it old Treacle with two grains of Opium; or rather with three grains of Laudanum diſſolved in Wine. Anoint his Belly with the following Oyls.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, The Palpitation of the Heart is oftner and much more violent from a fault in the Cardiack Arteries, which is either an Obſtruction or a Convulſion.

                  <p>Moreover, It is probable, that the paſſage of the Blood is hindred, ſometimes by a Polypus growing within the Sinus of the Heart: But it is difficultly known, and hardly cured; when there is a Suſpicion of it, Saline Medicines ſeem moſt proper, and of thoſe ſuch as are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile or acid: But they are not to be given together, you are to try one ſort firſt, and if that does not do, you muſt try the other.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXII. Of Weakneſs.</head>
                  <p>THE Cauſe of Weakneſs, is a Defect of Native Heat, and of Spirits: This Defect is occaſioned by the Defect of Vital Spirits: The Vital Spirits are wanting, either when they are not generated in a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, or becauſe, when they are generated, they are diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, corrupted, or ſuffocated, as it happens in Fainting: But the difference betwixt Fainting and Weakneſs is, That in Fainting the Cauſes produce their Effect of a ſudden, but in Weakneſs by degrees.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe reſpects the taking away the Cauſe, and the cheriſhing the Heart and Vital Spirits.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes are, almoſt all great Diſeaſes, whereby Nature is much weakned; therefore the taking off the Cauſes, reſpects the Cure of almoſt all Diſeaſes, which muſt be ſought for in their proper Chapters.</p>
                  <p>But the Strengthning the Heart, and the Reſtoration of the Vital Spirits, are to be treated of a part, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be preferred before the Cure of the Morbifick Cauſes, when there is danger of Death: But you muſt always take care, that whilſt you endeavour to refreſh the Spirits, you do not increaſe the Morbifick Cauſes; and therefore in a hot Diſeaſe you muſt give temperate Cordials, in a cold ſuch as are hot.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, With Meat you muſt mix Cordials, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Alkermes, or of Hyacinth in Broths; alſo Mutton Broth, the Fat and Skin being cut off, is good; alſo Gravy of Mutton is frequently uſed, and the Gravy of the Heart is mightily commended. The <hi>Italians</hi> make a Soop of Yolks of Eggs, Wine, Sugar and Cinnamon, which is very reſtorative. Jelly of Harts-horn is alſo very good. Cordial Juleps may be alſo prepared in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To the Stomach may be applied Bags made of Spices, and moiſtned with Wine; the private parts may be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with Confection of Alkermes diſſolved in Wine: The Arteries of the Temples, the Hands and Feet may be anointed with the ſame.

                  <head>CHAP. LXIII. Of Appetite depraved, diminiſhed, and aboliſhed.</head>
                  <p>THE Cauſe of an exceſſive Appetite, is a ſharp Juice abounding in the Body, and eſpecially brought from the Pancreas to the Inteſtine; and ſending thence Vapors that are ſharper than uſual to the Stomach. This Acid is increaſed in the whole Body by ſharp Meats, and Drinks, Cold and Serene Air, immoderate Grief continued long, violent Motion, and long Watching.</p>
                  <p>The Appetite is diminiſhed by Fat Choler, and by Fat and Viſcid Meat, by Hot or Rainy Weather, by too much Sleep, Sloath and great Cares.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes that diminiſh Appetite will wholly aboliſh it, if they are extream.</p>
                  <p>Depraved Appetite is uſual in the Green-ſickneſs, and in Women with Child, and ſometimes, but rarely, Men are troubled with it: It moſt frequently happens before the Flux of the Courſes, or when they are ſuppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>In the Green-ſickneſs they crave for Meats that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and unuſual, or they eat Chalk, Aſhes, Coals, Pitch, Dirt, Leather, and many other things.</p>
                  <p>Appetite increaſed, is to be cured with ſuch things as temperate the acid Juice, as Coral, Pearls, Crabs-eyes,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:65404:101"/>
Filings of Steel, and the like; alſo Fat and Oily things, and Volatile Spirits.</p>

                     <hi>Take of Coral prepared, and Pearls prepared, each one ſcruple; of white Chalk half a ſcruple, of white Sugar three drams; make a Powder to be divided into ſix Doſes. Take two Papers in a day, three or four hours after eating, in a Spoonful of ſtrong Wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Liquid Medicine be more pleaſing, let him take a Spoonful of the following Mixture now and then.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Mint two ounces, and of Scurvy-graſs-water, and of the Tincture of Cinnamon made by Infuſion in rectified Spirit of Wine, each half an ounce; of Syrup of Wormwood one ounce; mingle them.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oyl of Mace by Diſtillation, and of the Oyl of Juniper-berries, each one ſcruple; mingle them in a Glaſs: Let the Sick take two or three drops of this Oyl in a Spoonful of Malago Sack, or in any other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Wine, or in the foregoing mixture, and let him eat fat Broths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Appetite diminiſhed or aboliſhed muſt be cured by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines that evacuate, and correct Flegmatick and Viſcid Humours: Acids and Spices correct them, Coloquintida, Turbith, Hermodactiles, evacuate them.</p>

                     <hi>Take of Tartar vitriolated half a dram, of Cream of Tartar one dram; of white Sugar-candy two drams; mingle them; make a Powder to be divided into three Doſes. Let him take one or two in a day in Rheniſh-wine, or in the preceding mixture; and if he pleaſe, inſtead of Spirit of Salt, he may add half a dram of Elixir pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis to be taken by Spoonfuls</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:65404:102"/>They that diſlike Acids, may take the following mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Spoonfuls.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>They that had rather take a medicated Wine, may uſe the following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Elecampane, and of Acorus, each two drams; of the leaves of Sage, Marjoram, Garden-rue, each one handful; of the Seeds of ſweet Fennel two drams, of Orange-peel dried one dram; being cut, and groſsly bruiſed, put them into a Bag, and hang it in a Glaſs, and pour on it twenty ounces of Whitewine; after it has ſtood a night in a Cellar, three, four or five ounces may be taken in a Morning Fasting, or at Dinner or Supper, as every one pleaſes, or as they find it agrees beſt with them. And freſh Wine may be put on as long as the Aromatick Vertue remains in the Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Purging is neceſſary,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the greater Faetid Pills half a dram, of Coche one ſcruple, Extractum Catholicon ten grains, Oyl of Cloves two drops; mix them, make fifteen Pills, gild them, or cover them with Powder of Liquoriſh or Cinnamon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Sick take five of theſe Pills, or more, if he be hard, to Purge.</p>
                  <p>But if you deſign to add Chymical Medicines in form of Pills, you may preſcribe in the following manner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Gum-ammoniacum, or Opoponax, or the like, cleanſed by Vinegar, and afterwards thickned, half a dram; of the Troches Alhandal, Mercurius dulcis, each one ſcruple; mix them, make fifteen Pills, and gild them: Let the Sick, take five or more of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:65404:102"/>But if the form of an Apozem ſeem more convenient for the Sick, he having no great Averſion to bitter things, the following is convenient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Liquoriſh raſped half an ounce, of the Roots of Smalage one ounce, of the Shavings of Guajacum three ounces, of Laurel-berries, and Seeds of Anniſe, each two drams; of the Pulp of Coloquintida half a dram; boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Rain-water, in thirty ounces of the ſtrained Decoction, diſſolve of Syrup of Roſes ſolutive, with Senna of Diacnicum, each one ounce and an half; of the Salt of Tartar vitriolated two Scruples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tincture of Cinnamon one ounce; mix them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the Sick take three, four or five ounces of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction once or twice a day, by which the Flegmatick and viſcid Humours, are both corrected and evacuated <hi>per Epicraſin.</hi> In the mean time let the Sick abſtain from fat and viſcid Meats: Let him uſe a clear Air that is hot and dry: Let Sleeping be diminiſhed if it be too long: Let the Mind be chearful: Let the Motion and Exerciſe of the Body be moderate. Evacuation by Stool and Urine, daily ought to be proportionable to what is taken in by the Mouth, if it can be conveniently.</p>
                  <p>Appetite diminiſhed by fat Choler is preſently cured by correcting of it, if it abound too much it muſt be evacuated either by Stool or Vomit,</p>
                  <p>For correcting of this Choler, there is nothing more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual than Elixir Proprietatis given in Wine, or any other convenient Mixture, five or ſix drops at a time, eſpecially before Eating.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who do not love Acids, may take in place of it ſweet Spirit of Salt, prepared with rectified Spirit of Wine by ſeveral Cohobations.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Choler is corrected by Wormwood, and Wormwood-wine; in the place of which alſo, other Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Plants may be likewiſe infuſed in Wine, which may be drank in a ſmall Quantity at Dinner and Supper.</p>

                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:65404:103"/>Choler is very conveniently evacuated by Vomit, by ſeveral Medicines prepared of Antimony, as Crocus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallorum, Glaſs of Antimony, and the Sapa Vomitoria that is made of it, Oxyſarcharum, or Oxymel Vomito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, Mercurius Vitae, or the like.</p>
                  <p>Rhubarb, Scammony, Tamarinds, and the like, evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Choler by Stool.</p>
                  <p>Scammony may be prepared preſently and well, if a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Doſe of it, twelve or fifteen Grains, more or leſs, according to the Age and Conſtitution of the Sick, be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a Mortar, and a little Baulm-water, Succory-water, or the like, be poured upon it, and rubbed with it till it becomes of a milky Colour; pour it off and put more Water on, that all the Vertue of the Scammony may be extracted leaving the black Faeces at the Bottom; then add to the Liquor of Cinnamon-water, or Fennel-water, or ſome other Aromatick-water, two drams; of Syrup of Roſes ſolutive, or the like, two or three drams; and ſo you will have a very pleaſant Purging Draught; and that it may work the eaſier, a Scruple or half a dram of Cream of Tartar may be drank in Broth half an Hour after taking the Purging Draught.</p>
                  <p>Pleaſant Tablets may be alſo made of Scammony in the following manner.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Tablets may be conveniently preſcribed for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, Children, and delicate People; the higheſt Doſe of them is from three drams to half an ounce; an Infant muſt take but half a dram, or a dram, a Youth may take two drams.</p>
                  <p>They who are afraid to uſe Scammony or Medicines made of Scammony, though it be a kind, ſafe, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Medicine, may uſe Rhubarb in the following manner.</p>

                  <p>To evacuate the over abounding Choler, thoſe that had rather uſe an Electuary may take of the following.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>The Cure of a depraved Appetite, depends on the Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Blood and Humours: But Volatile Salts are more ſucceſsful in this caſe than any other Medicines, a few grains of them being taken twice or thrice in a day in Wine or ſome other Liquor, eſpecially at Dinner or Supper; and to evacuate the vicious Humours, Purging and Vomiting muſt be uſed.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXIV. Of Nauſeouſneſs, Belching, and Vomiting.</head>
                  <p>IN perfect Health nothing is wont to be evacuated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Mouth, wherefore whatever comes this way ſignifies Sickneſs, whether it be Meat, Wind, or a thick or thin Liquor.</p>
                  <p>When Wind comes forth with a Noiſe it is called Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, when the Meat is ejected it is called Vomiting.</p>
                  <p>Nauſeouſneſs always precedes Vomiting, and ſometimes Belching.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:65404:104"/>Wind by reaſon of the Clammineſs of its Nature, ſticks to the Stomach, and is difficultly excluded, and is often accompanied with an Inflation of the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>Belching ariſes from windy Meats, or from other flatulent things taken inwardly, as Cheſnuts, Peaſe, Beans, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neps, Rediſhes, and the like, or from Flegmatick and viſcid Humours ſticking to the Stomach, and rarified to Wind by taking Aromaticks.</p>
                  <p>That the material cauſe of Wind, is a Flegmatick and clammy Humour, is evident from the Antecedent Cauſes; as from Meats of a like kind, <hi>viz.</hi> Milk, Fiſh, eſpecially Sea-Fiſh, and the Feet of Animals, and Gellies; and from the Cure, which is wholly performed by evacuating and correcting Flegmatick Humours.</p>
                  <p>As in Belching, only Wind is evacuated, ſo in Vomiting, either Meat crude, or more or leſs fermented, or various ſorts of Humours, as Watery, ſerous flegmatick, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick, and the like; thin, thick, white, yellow, green, Sky coloured, or black Humours, or the like, inſipid, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, acid, rough, ſweet, ſtinking, or Humours without Taſte, and ſometimes bloody Matter, or Excrements.</p>
                  <p>All Vomiting is occaſioned by the Stomach being Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily or Secondarily affected.</p>
                  <p>The Stomach is Primarily affected, when the Cauſe of Vomiting, or of the Periſtaltick Motion inverted is in it ſelf. It is Secondarily affected by conſent from other Parts; and it is provoked to the Inverſion of its Periſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Motion, in Part or altogether by the Periſtaltick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Guts, which is ſometimes occaſioned by the violent Agitation of the Diaphragma, and of the Muſcles of the Belly by a violent Cough.</p>
                  <p>The Stomach is primarily diſpoſed to vomit, firſt when it is inflamed, excoriated, or ulcerated; then it is eaſily excited to any violent Contraction of it ſelf from any ſort of Nouriſhment taken. Secondly, When the Nouriſhment by its Quantity, and chiefly by its Quality, is troubleſome to the Stomach. Thirdly, when ſharp Humours from he Head fall upon the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From the total Inverſion of the Periſtaltick Motion of the Guts, Vomiting is occaſioned, as in the Iliack Paſſion, whereby Gliſters are often vomited up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:65404:104"/>From the ſame Motion inverted in Part, Vomiting is occaſioned frequently, as in the Cholera Morbus, and from any other Motion upwards of Humours fermenting in the ſmall Guts, and by Reaſon of the Paſſage of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements ſtopped.</p>
                  <p>In a violent Cough the Diaphragm being ſhaken violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Vomiting is occaſioned; which we think to be cauſed by a conjunct Compreſſion of all the Bowels contained in the Abdomen made towards the Breaſt, which mightily troubles the Stomach, and forces it to the Inverſion of the natural Motion.</p>
                  <p>Vomiting oecaſioned by things taken in at the Mouth, is quieted of its own accord, ſo ſoon as they are vomited up, or upon uſe of a few Aromaticks, and Opiats, it is ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and cured. For Inſtance,</p>

                  <p>Vomiting of Blood occaſioned by the Rupture or Eroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Veſſels of the Stomach and Inteſtins, is cured by conglutinating them by the following Mixture, which is alſo uſeful in other Excreſions of the Blood.</p>

by Stool; but if there is danger of the Blood's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating, to the foregoing Mixture may be added half a dram of Crabs-eyes, and one ſcruple of Diaphoretick Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
                  <p>Vomiting of Matter chiefly following an Inflammation of the Pancreas, or of ſome neighbouring Part, or ſome notable Ulcer, muſt be cured by curing the Primary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time you may uſe the above deſcribed Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with Crabs-eyes and Antimonium Diaphoreticum.</p>
                  <p>It will be alſo proper to give a drop of Balſam of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur anniſated in all the Liquor he takes.</p>
                  <p>The belching and generation of Wind will be cured by, Firſt, avoiding Flegmatick and Windy Meats: Secondly, By inciding and evacuating clammy Flegm: Thirdly, By attemperating the Choler if it be acrid: Fourthly, By diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing the Wind that is already made.</p>
                  <p>Acids and Aromaticks, and volatile Salts, incide clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Flegm, and Flegmagoges purge it off. Spirit of Nitre attemperates Choler when it is acrid better than any thing elſe; two or three drops of it being taken in common Beer, or in ſome convenient Mixture.</p>
                  <p>Moſt Spices diſcuſs Wind, ſo do the Oyls of them, but eſpecially the Seeds, Flowers, and Barks; but Spirit of Niter is better than all, for it corrects Choler and Flegm, and hinders the Generation of Wind, and diſcuſſes that which is generated.

                  <p>THe Hickops are a Convulſive Motion of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
                  <p>The Matter occaſioning the Hickops is either collected in the Stomach, or communicated to it from the Liver, Spleen, Bowels, or other Parts, or from the whole Body; ſo ſharp Meats or Medicines, ſharp Humours or Worms contained in the Stomach, may occaſion an Idiophathick Hickop: But a Sympathick is occaſioned by Inflammations of the neighbouring Parts, or from Humours, or ſharp Vapours transferred to the Stomach from Diſeaſes of the whole Body, as in acute and malignant Feavers.</p>
                  <p>The Signs of the Cauſes muſt be thus diſtinguiſhed: If it be Idiopathick it is more continual, and Signs of Humours contained, in the Stomach appear, and then it is cured by Vomiting.</p>
                  <p>The Peccant Humour collected in the Stomach, may be known by Vomiting, Belching, a Taſte in the Mouth, and other Signs,</p>
                  <p>If it proceed from a Diſeaſe of any other Part, the Signs of it muſt be ſought for in the proper Chapters.</p>

                  <p>If it happen in a Feaver, it ſhews that the Diſeaſe is very dangerous: A Hickop coming after Vomiting is alſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>

                  <p>An Idiopathick Hickop is occaſioned by Flegm, Wind, Choler, or any other acrid or malignant Humour.</p>
                  <p>That which is occaſioned by a Flegmatick Humour muſt be cured by Remedies that incide, purge, and cleanſe that Humour, and that ſtrengthen the Stomach; to which may be added the following Medicines, which are peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly proper for the Symptom.</p>

                  <p>That which prooceeds from Wind, muſt be cured by Remedies that are proper to expel Wind: Let Cupping-glaſſes be applied to the Region of the Stomach, which, like a Miracle, mitigate and take off ſuddenly flatulent Diſeaſes of the Lower-belly.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>If there be a Suſpicion of a malignant Quality, Treacle or ſome other Alexipharmick muſt be preſcribed; and the Region of the Stomach muſt be anointed with the Oyl of Scorpions.</p>
                  <p>But from whatſoever Cauſe the Hickops ariſe, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Medicines are to be uſed. Firſt, The Peccant Humour muſt be evacuated by Vomit, if the Sick can bear it, and it muſt be repeated, if the Diſeaſe be leſſened by it, but not quite taken away: and ſtrong Vomits muſt be given, if the Caſe ſo require, as <hi>Platerus</hi> teaches in his Practice, whereof he mentions an Obſervation in theſe Words. A Surgeon was ſeized with the Hickops, and they were ſo continual Night and Day, that he cou'd not ſleep, nor ſcarce ſpeak or eat, being extreamly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them, he earneſtly deſired we ſhould give him a ſtrong Chimical Vomit, which being taken, he caſt up a vaſt Quantity of green and black Choler, the Vomiting ſtopt, and he recovered.</p>
                  <p>But if the Sick cannot take a Vomit, he muſt be purged by ſtool, but the Humour muſt be firſt prepared by things that incide and cleanſe: Afterwards theſe things that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low are convenient.</p>
                  <p>Cupping-glaſſes muſt be applied oppoſite to the Region of the Stomach, and to the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>The Stomach muſt be bound with a Swath-band, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65404:107"/>
it may not be ſo much dilated. Ligatures of the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>Let him eat Anniſeeds, which is thought to Cure the Hickops peculiarly.</p>
                  <p>Frequently Gliſters muſt be injected, to draw away the Noxious Humours from the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>Young Animals muſt be applied to the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>Vinegar of Squills may be taken by Spoonfuls.</p>
                  <p>Sneezing caſts off the Matter impacted in the Coats of the Stomach. As the Phyſician <hi>Chryſimacus</hi> cured <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtophanes</hi> of a Hickop by provoking Sneezing, when he could not do it by ſtopping of the Spirits, and Gargling with cold Water.</p>
                  <p>Pills made of one dram of Aloes, and three grains of London Laudanum are good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Platerus</hi> in his Obſervations ſays, That he cured a Boy of ten Years of Age, that had the Hickops for eight Days and Nights continually, with the Water of green Nuts diſtilled, with Radiſhes infuſed, firſt in Vinegar, which he gave him to provoke Vomiting; and though he did not Vomit at all, yet he was cured.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude, Narcoticks wiil do the Buſineſs when nothing elſe will.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXVII. Of the Cholera Morbus, <hi>i. e.</hi> Vomiting and Looſneſs.</head>
                  <p>THis Diſeaſe was moſt Epidemical in the Year 1669, ſays Doctor <hi>Sydenham,</hi> than ever he knew it in any other Year; it comes as certainly at the latter end of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as Swallows at the beginning of Spring, and as Cuckows at the Heat of the following Seaſon. That Diſeaſe which is occaſioned by a Surfeit comes at any time, the Symptoms are indeed alike, and the Cure the ſame, yet it is of another kind. The Diſeaſe is eaſily known, for there are violent Vomitings, and an Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ill Humours, with great Difficulty and Trouble by Stool; there is a violent Pain and Inflation of the Belly and Guts, an Heart-burning, Drouth, and quick-pulſe, with Heat and Anxiety, with great Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouſneſs, and ſometimes a Colliquative Sweat, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions of the Arms and Legs, Fainting, a Coldneſs of the extream Parts, and ſuch-like Symptoms, which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrifie the By-ſtanders, and kill the Patient in twenty four Hours. There is alſo a dry Cholera from a flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit breaking out above and below without Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Looſneſs.</p>
                  <p>I have found, by diligent Application of Mind, and by manifold Eperience, that if on the one hand I ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to expel the ſharp Humours, that are the Fewel of the Diſeaſe, by Catharticks, I ſhould do juſt as he that endeavours to quench Fire with Oyl, ſeeing the Operation of the moſt gentle Cathartick wou'd but give farther Diſturbance, and raiſe new Tumults: And on the other Hand, ſhould I at the firſt reſtrain the primary Effort with Narcotick Medicines, and other Aſtringents, whilſt I hindred natural Evacuation, and detained the Humour againſt Nature, the Patient would be undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly deſtroyed by an inteſtine War, his Enemy being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in his Bowels: For theſe Reaſons therefore, I thought I muſt go the middle Way, that I might partly evacuate, and partly dilute the Humour. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ound out
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65404:110"/>
this Method ſeveral Years ago, and have long experienced it, and have by it many Times reduced this Diſeaſe to good Order.</p>
                  <p>A Young Chicken is boiled in about three Gallons of Spring-water, ſo that the Liquor hath ſcarce any Reliſh of the Chick. The Patient is ordered to drink ſeveral large Draughts of this a little warm; at the ſame time a good quantity will ſerve for ſeveral Gliſters, to be given ſucceſſively, until all the Broths be conſumed, and rendred upwards and downwards; an ounce of the Syrups of Lettice, Violets, Purſlain, Water-lilly, may be now and then mixt with the Draughts and Gliſters; though the Broth may do very well without any ſuch Addition. So the Stomach being loaded with a conſiderable quantity of the Liquor, and as I may ſay turned, and the Injection of Gliſters being reiterated, the ſharp Humours are either caſt out, or their Acrimony being taken off, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a due Temper, the Filth being caſt up by theſe means, which require three or fours Hours: Some Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorick Medicine perfects the Cure; I uſe this often.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Couſlip-water one ounce, of Aqua-mirabilis one dram, Liquid Laudanum fourteen drops.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Inſtead of which any Shop-Narcotick may be made uſe of, and this way of diluting the Humours is much ſafer, and more expedite, than that which is moſt commonly taken to ſtop this moſt dangerous Diſeaſe; <hi>viz.</hi> either by Evacuaters or Aſtringents; becauſe the Tumult is height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Evacuaters, and all things are put in a Hurly-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by them; and the other, on the contrary, detain an Enemy in the Bowels, and of a Stranger do plainly make him an Inhabitant: To ſay nothing of the tedious Trouble created to the Patient, when the Diſeaſe is protracted, whereby at length the Bad Humours creep into the Maſs of Blood, and eaſily kindle a malignant Fever.</p>
                  <p>But it is to be diligently noted, That if the Phiſician be not called till the Voming and Looſneſs have continued many Hours, ſuppoſe ten or twelve, and the Patient is worn out, ſo that the extream Parts wax cold; I ſay in this caſe, all other Remedies being omitted, he muſt immediately fly to Laudanum, the ſacred Anchor in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65404:110"/>
which is not only to be given when the Symptoms are urgent, but alſo after the Vomiting and Looſneſs go off, and to be repeated Morning and Evening daily, till the Patient has recovered his Strength and Health.</p>
                  <p>Though this Diſeaſe be Epidemical, yet it very ſeldom laſts longer than <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in which it firſt began; on which Account I have been induced to contemplate that moſt ſubtile and elegant Artifice, which Nature uſes in the Production of Epidemick Diſeaſes; for though the ſame Cauſes wholly remain, ſo that many ſhould be ſeiſed with this Diſeaſe as well in September as Auguſt, by reaſon of eating too much Fruit, yet we ſee the ſame Effect does not follow: And he that has carefully collected the Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na of a legitimate Cholera, of which only we treat at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, will confeſs, that that Diſeaſe which invades at any other time of the Year, though coming upon the ſame oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and accompanied with ſome of the ſame Symptoms, is quite different from this now ſpoken of; juſt as if there were ſome ſecret and peculiar thing in the Air of this pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Month, able to impreſs on the Blood, or on the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Stomach, ſome ſuch ſpecifick Alteration adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only to this Diſeaſe.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXVIII. Of a Pain in the Stomach.</head>
                  <p>A Pain of the Stomach proceeds from ſomething that diſtends and gnaws it, and ſo cauſes a Solution of the Continuum.</p>
                  <p>But in the Stomach three very different Parts are to be conſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> The upper and lower Orifice, and the Body of it which makes its Cavity.</p>
                  <p>The upper Orifice is indued with an exquiſite Senſe, becauſe a great Nerve is placed there proceeding from the ſixth Conjugation, and therefore the Pains in it are very ſharp, and the Heart, by reaſon of its nearneſs is alſo affected; and therefore this Pain is called Cardialgia, and Cardiogmos; and ſo great is the Agreement of the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65404:111"/>
Heart with the upper Orifice of the Stomach, that the Ancients called this Orifice <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Membranes, conſtituting the Cavity of the Stomach, or if the lower Orifice be affected, it is called a Pain of the Stomach, or the Cholick of the Stomach, eſpecially when it is occaſioned by Wind.</p>
                  <p>The next cauſe of this Pain, is a Solution of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuum occaſioned by things that bite and diſtend; and thoſe things that chiefly and moſt frequently bite and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtend the Stomach, are Humours, or Wind, whereunto may be added Worms velicating the Tunicks of the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>Acrid and Malignant Humours, as green or Black Choler, ſalt Flegm, corrupt Ichor, Stinking Matter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from an Abſceſs of the Liver or Breaſt broken, and poured upon the Stomach, and all other Acrimonious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, may occaſion a Pain of the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>Alſo acid Vapours ariſing from the ſaid Humours may occaſion the ſame Pain: Wind alſo contained in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Stomach may occaſion Inflation, and a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tenſion, but eſpecially when it is contained within the Tunicks of the Stomach, which makes the Diſeaſe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, becauſe it can be hardly diſcuſſed.</p>
                  <p>Diſeaſes alſo of the Stomach, and of the neighbouring Parts are wont to occaſion this Pain, as a hot or cold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies, Inflammation, Schirrhus, or any other hard Tumour occaſioning a heavy Pain: And laſtly, Wounds and Ulcers of the Part, and Tumours and Inflations of the Neighbouring Parts, by preſſing the Stomach may occaſion Pain.</p>
                  <p>But Humours and Wind that occaſion the Pain of the Stomach, are either generated in the Stomach, or flow from the whole Body, or ſome Parts of it; from the whole Body in Feavers, or when the Body is full of ill Humours; from other Parts, but eſpecially from the Liver, Spleen, and Brain; from the Liver flows Choler, from the Spleen Melancholly and black Choler, from the Head ſalt Flegm.</p>
                  <p>Alſo from other extraordinary and rare Cauſes, ſuch a Pain may ariſe, as from Stones generated in the Stomach, and the like. <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> relates, that a Matron having ſwallowed a piece of the Rine of Bacon, kept it in her
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65404:111"/>
Stomach two Years, and was afflicted with continual Pain, and at length by taking a Vomit, ſhe caſt it up and was cured.</p>
                  <p>External cauſes occaſioning this Diſeaſe, are either Meats infected with an ill Quality, or indued with a great deal of Acrimony, which are ſufficient of themſelves to occaſion ſuch a Pain, or they are apt to generate Winds; or taken in too great a quantity, they putrifie and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Acrimonious, or they are too hot: Or ſtrong and acrid Medicines, or ſuch as are indued with a deſtructive Faculty may occaſion the Pain; or when they are taken in too great a quantity, or not being well corrected, and Poiſons may alſo occaſion the ſame Pain.</p>
                  <p>The Diagnoſtick Signs are to be directed to the Part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and to the cauſe, and firſt the Situation of the Pain ſhews that the upper Orifice of the Stomach is affected, when it is perceived under the Xiphoid Cartilage, but the violence of the Pain occaſioned by the exquiſite ſenſe of the Part ſhews more certainly that this Part is affected, and that it is a true Cardialgia, ſo do the Anxiety and Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, ſo that the Sick cannot abide in one Poſture, there is alſo Fainting and Swooning by Reaſon of the Conſent of the Heart, wherewith there is a great Sympathy, not only by Reaſon of the Nearneſs, but becauſe there is a great Loſs of Spirits by the violence of the Pain; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo the Brain is affected by Sympathy, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great Nerve that is implanted in this Part, and becauſe acrid Vapours are elevated to the Head from the Stomach, upon which account Head-achs, Gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, and the Falling-Sickneſs ariſe ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>In other Parts of the Stomach there are alſo ſharp Pains, but they are not accompanied with ſo grievous Symptoms, and they reſemble Chollick Pains, but they differ in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes occaſioning theſe Pains are diſtinguiſhed by their proper Signs, whereof the moſt plain are known by things evacuated; for if Flegm, or Choler, or Wind, or Worms, are ejected by Vomit or Stool, it is eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture that the Diſeaſe proceeds from ſuch Cauſes; but though there be no Evacuation of the Morbifick Matter, we may know by peculiar Signs, when Choler, Flegm, or Wind abounds.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:65404:112"/>The Signs alſo of Worms may be taken from the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Worms, and the peculiar Diſeaſes of the Stomach it ſelf, or of the Neighbouring Parts occaſioning this Diſeaſe may be known by every ones proper Signs; the Humour cauſing the Pain may be alſo gueſſed at by the Time of the Invaſion, of its Increaſe and Ceſſation; for in ſome the Pain is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worſt before eating, and this ſignifies that Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler prevails, which when the Sick is faſting is drawn into the Stomach, or becomes more acrid thereby; in others the Pain begins preſently after eating, becauſe the crude and biting Humours, which before lay quiet in the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks of the Stomach, are diſturbed by eating; or being ſeated in the bottom of the Stomach, they at that time are raiſed, and offend the upper Orifice, and in ſome the Pain is worſt whilſt the Meat is concocting, becauſe acrid and biting Vapours are elevated from the Morbifick Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Heat increaſed in the Stomach at the Time of Concoction; in others four or five Hours after eating, becauſe the Meat is corrupted by the Concoction being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, by which means it velicates the Stomach; in others the Pain is augmented after Sleep, and this is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by a Catarrh, the Humour flowing from the Brain in the Sleep, which being heaped up in a great quantity occaſions Pain when the Sick awakes; but the Pain is ſometimes quieted by eating, the Acrimony of the Humours being aſſwaged by the Benignity of the Food.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick, it is certain that a Cardialgia is much more dangerous than other Pains of the Stomach, by reaſon of the exquiſite ſenſe of the Mouth of the Stomach, and the great Sympathy that is betwixt that and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple parts.</p>
                  <p>The greater or leſſer is the Pravity of the Morbifick cauſe, and the violence of the Symptoms, ſo is the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger more or leſs.</p>
                  <p>A continual and acute Feaver, joined with a great Pain of the Stomach, threatens great Danger; for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, Aphor. 65. Section 5. A great Heat about the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and Cardiogmos in Feavers, are ill, for they ſignifie a great Quantity of vitious Humours contained in the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>A Pain of the Stomach, occaſioned by Worms or Wind is moſt commonly leſs dangerous, for that the Cauſe is not
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65404:112"/>
ſo obſtinate, and not fixed to the Part; but yet ſometimes violent Symptoms ariſe from Worms contained in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and biting it, whereby the Sick is preſently killed; and alſo when the Intemperies occaſioning Wind is obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, as it were habitual, it is not without Danger, becauſe it degenerates into a dry Dropſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Aphor. 7. Sect. 4. ſays, That Coldneſs in the extream parts, in a Cardialgia, portends Death.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is to be varied according to the Variety of the Cauſes, for if it ariſes from the Diſeaſes of other Parts, the Cure of them muſt be taken Care of; but if the Cauſe be ſeated in the Stomach it ſelf, the Pain proceeds either from Wind or ſharp and cholerick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, or from an Inflammation, Abſceſs, or Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>That which is generated by Wind, muſt be cured by Remedies that diſcuſs and evacuate that flatulent Matter, and alſo Flegm which breeds Wind.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, An emollient and looſning Gliſter muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and preſently after a carminative and diſcuſſing Gliſter made of the Decoction of the Leaves of Wild-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram, Calaminth, Penny-royal, Rue, and the leſſer-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taury, the Seeds of Anniſe, Fennel, Daucus, Cummin, and the like, wherein may be diſſolved Benedictum Lax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ativum, Oyl of Dill, Rue, and Honey of Roſemary.</p>
                  <p>If the Pain continue, a Gliſter muſt be made of Oyl of Rue, or of Nuts, and of generous Wine each equal Parts, you muſt add to it two ounces of Aqua-vitae, or you may prepare a Gliſter of Whitewine mixed with eight drops of Oyl of Juniper, Cinnamon, or of Chymical Oyl of Cloves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Afterwards the following Fomentation muſt be applyed to the Region of the Stomach.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſhmallows half an ounce, of red Roſes, the Flowers of Camomil, and of the Tops of Centaury, each one handful; boil them in Fountain and Camomil-water to a Pint and an half; at laſt add a little good Rheniſh-wine, Roſe-water, and Vinegar, make a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</hi>

                  <p>In the mean time whilſt theſe things are about, if the Stomach be nauſeous, Vomiting may be provoked by ſome gentle Vomit, or a Purge may be given that evacuates Flegm.</p>
                  <p>After the Body is purged, Oyl of bitter Almonds mixed with White-wine may be taken, or Aqua-clareta, or Cinnamon-water.</p>
                  <p>The following Julep is very effectual to eaſe Pain, diſcuſs Wind, to cleanſe Flegm, and to ſtrengthen the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves of common Worm-wood, of the leſſer Centaury, and Agrimony, each half an handful; boil them to five ounces; in the Liquor diſſolve one ounce of white Sugar. Let it be taken for two days in the Morning.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> greatly commends the diſtilled Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Camomil-flowers, as a ſpecial Remedy to eaſe Pains of the Bowels and Stomach; three ounces of it may be taken warm; or in the place of this Water, a Decoction of Camomil-flowers may be uſed, which is greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Foreſtus,</hi> who ſays, that he cured a certain Merchant of a violent Pain in the Stomach, with only
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65404:113"/>
giving this Decoction once; he had no ſooner drank it than he fell into a Sweat, belching up Wind, and in a Minute all the Pains went off, ſo that there was no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for any other Remedies. A Vomit may be prepared of this Decoction, made with Seeds of Dill, or with Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, or the Roots of Wake-robin, wherein may be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Oxymel, Syrup of Sorrel, or of Roſes ſolutive, which may be given at the beginning of the Diſeaſe to mitigate the Pain by evacuation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that a Cupping-glaſs applied to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach removes the Pain wonderfully, but this Caution muſt be taken notice of, <hi>viz.</hi> That but little or no crude Humour be in the Stomach, for if there be, it will increaſe the Pain.</p>
                  <p>Bread freſh drawn out of the Oven, cut in the middle, and applied to the Part, does good, either by it ſelf or ſprinkled with Aromatick Powders.</p>
                  <p>But if the Diſeaſe be obſtinate, you muſt uſe a Bath made of a Decoction of emollient and healing Herbs, which is ſafeſt and moſt effectual, for it eaſes the Pain by diſcuſſing the Wind, and driving it through rhe Pores of of the Skin.</p>
                  <p>But the Buiſneſs will be ſooner done, if in the Bath the Sick take ſome diſcutient Remedy, for both concurring the Cure will be effectually performed.</p>
                  <p>The Bath ought to be very hot, that the Wind may be the eaſier diſcuſſed, and that the groſs Humours may be melted,</p>
                  <p>If Gliſters cannot be injected or retained, by reaſon of the violence of the Pain, a Purge muſt be given in the Bath, where the Sick muſt continue half an hour or an hour till the Purge begins to operate.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes when there is danger, by reaſon of the violence of the Pain, Narcoticks muſt be given, which being prudently adminiſtred do often a great deal of good.</p>
                  <p>Some mix Narcoticks with Purgers, that the Pain may be eaſed, and the peccant Matter evacuated at the ſame Time.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Afterwards the Acrimony of the Humours is to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated by cooling and thickning Juleps; by Emulſions of the four greater cold ſeeds, by new Milk, Oyl of ſweet Almonds newly drawn, by Yolks of Eggs and the like.</p>
                  <p>Strenghning Medicines muſt be uſed, and Narcoticks upon occaſion, and outwardly muſt be applied a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm of White-bread Crums boiled in Milk, Yolks of Eggs and Saffron being added. Or you may apply Bread freſh drawn and cut in the middle and moiſtened with Vinegar; or let the part be fomented with a Decoction of the Flowers of Camomil, Violets, and of Water-lillies; or which is much better, let the Sick be bathed with warm Water, for this is very effectual for the Cure of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>If when the Pain is eaſed, it ſhould chance to return again, the Sick muſt be purged twice a Month, and the hot Intemperies muſt be corrected by a cooling Diet and convenient Remedies.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXIX. Of an Inflammation, Abſceſs, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer of the Stomach.</head>
                  <p>THough in the Stomach, as in all other Parts, all ſorts of Tumours may happen, yet here we only treat of an Inflammation or Phlegmon, which is moſt frequent, for other Tumours rarely happen, and may be cured by the ſame Method, wherewith the Tumours of other inward parts are.</p>
                  <p>An Inflammation of the Stomach is a preternatural Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ariſing from Blood poured upon the Subſtance of the Stomach, and its Membranes. And this Blood is either pure and ſincere, and then it produces a Phlegmon properly ſo called, or it is mixed with Choler, Flegm, and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, and then it produces an Oedematous, Schirrhus, Phlegmon, or a Phlegmon mixed with an Eryſipelas.</p>
                  <p>There may be many external Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Whatſoever renders the Blood hot, as hot Medicines; drinking of Wine, or whatever forces the Blood thither, as a Bruiſe of the Stomach, eſpecially when it is full of Meat; to which may be added hot and acrid things taken inwardly, as Cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides, Sublimate, and the like.</p>
                  <p>The Diagnoſtick Signs of this Diſeaſe are, a great Burnining, Pricking Diſtending, Pain with Pulſation, ſtretching it ſelf to the Back. The Tumour may be felt and ſometimes ſeen; the Shoulders are drawn backward; the Breathing, Swallowing, and Belching are difficult. Sometimes ſomething Bloody is Vomited up; there is a violent Feaver accompanied with dreadful Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>If the Inflammation be purely from Blood it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what gentler, but if it be joined with an E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yſipelas, the Symptoms are very violent, and there is an inward Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though the outward Parts are cold, and the Thirſt is unquenchable: To this Inflammation of the Stomach that Inflammation is near of kin, which either ſeiſes that Part of the Liver, wherewjth the Stomach is covered, or that lies upon the Region of the Abdomen, which can be only
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65404:115"/>
diſtinguiſhed by the violence of the Symptoms; for the Inflammation of the Stomach is the moſt violent and moſt dangerous.</p>
                  <p>From what has been ſaid, it may be eaſily prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that this Diſeaſe is very dangerous and moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deadly.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs that is moſt dangerous which ſeiſes the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Orifice of the Stomach, and partakes of the Nature of an Eryſipelas.</p>
                  <p>If the Inflammation do not kill, and be not reſolved, it degenerates into an Abſceſs, which is known by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Heat and Feaver, the Tumour remaining.</p>
                  <p>The Abſceſs being broken an Ulcer is left behind, which may be known by the Evacuation of Matter by Vomit and Stool.</p>
                  <p>But an Ulcer of the Stomach does not only proceed from an Abſceſs broken, but alſo from other cauſes, which muſt be here mentioned, leaſt any thing ſhould be deſicient in the Theory of it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the cauſes of an Ulcer of the Stomach are either Internal or External; the Internal cauſes are acrid Humours bred in the Stomach, or tranſmitted from another place to it, as Yellow and Black Choler, or ſalt Flegm.</p>
                  <p>The external cauſes, are acrid and corroding Medicines or Poiſons, and hither may be referred Wounds of the Stomach ill cured, which degenerate into an Ulcer; and alſo the Rupture of ſome great Vein, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well cured after vomiting much Blood up.</p>
                  <p>An Ulcer bred in the Stomach, may be known chiefly by the Evacuation of Matter by Vomit and Stool, to which primary Sign others may be added: For firſt, There is perceived in the Stomach a pricking Pain with Heat, eſpecially when any thing acrid, ſalt, acid, or any thing very hot or very cold is taken inwardly. There is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over a Loſs of Appetite, Stinking, Belching, and a ſmall and continual Feaver.</p>
                  <p>The Prognoſtick is moſt commonly deadly, unleſs the Ulcer be very ſmall, and poſſeſs the Superficies, and has not a Feaver joined with it; for the Membrane of the Stomach being ulcerated is difficultly cured, and the Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment cannot be well concocted, and it is rejected before
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65404:115"/>
a due concoction; beſides Medicines can do little good, for things that cleanſe, which are neceſſary for the Cure of the Ulcer, cauſe Pain; and things that dry, which ſhould ſatisfie the other Indication of Healing the Ulcer, are continually ſpoiled by the Meat and Drink, and Chyle, and other Humours which always ſtagnate in a weak Stomach.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of the foreſaid Diſeaſes is to be inſtituted particularly.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, The Cure of the Inflammation is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun by Bleeding repeated in the Arm as often as the Strength will bear; and though it may ſeem to be dejected at firſt by reaſon of the fainting and Coldneſs of the extream Parts, yet this Infirmity of the Strength proceeds from an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which requires Evacuation, and therefore Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought not to be forbid.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the opening of the Hemorrhoid Veins, if the Sick has been accuſtomed to this Evacuation, may conveniently cauſe a Revulſion of the Blood from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. Cupping-glaſſes applied to the Back and Buttocks, both dry and moiſt, Frictions and Ligatures of the extream Parts, and the heating thoſe that are wont to be cold, by applying hot Cloaths, and by anointing them with Oyl of Orris, Nard, and with other hot things, may be alſo conveniently uſed to draw the Blood from the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>But Purging is not allowed of, becauſe it diſturbes the Humours, and draws them to the Part affected. Yet <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen</hi> commends a Decoction of Tamarinds, or half an ounce of Caſſia, diſſolved in Endive-water, or in Whey, and would have it given daily till the ſeventh Day; yet it is better to abſtain from all purging at the Beginning; but the Seventh Day being over, and ſome Signs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction and Declination appearing, Purging may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted with a dram of Rhubarb, and a Scruple of red Sanders infuſed in Borrage-water; you muſt add one or two ounces of the Syrup of Roſes, that the Filth ſticking to the Part may be evacuated.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while Lenient, cooling, and emollient Gliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt be daily injected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Chicken-broth, or a Decoction of Mallows and Violets, one Pint; of Caſſia freſh drawn one ounce, of Oyl of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65404:116"/>
Roſes and Violets, each two ounces; of Sugar one ounce and an half, Yolks of Eggs number two; make a Gliſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame altering and corroborating things may be taken inwardly, which were propoſed for a Cure of the Pain of the Stomach occaſioned by a Cholerick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</p>
                  <p>But Syrup of Water-lillies, and of the Juice of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlain, are peculiarly proper, eſpecially at the beginning; becauſe they may ſerve inſtead of a repelling Medicine.</p>
                  <p>Emulſions alſo of the four cold Seeds, and of the Seeds of white-Poppies are proper, for they are lenitive, and qualifie the Heat, and ſo do alſo the following Juleps.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Roſes three ounces, of Plantane two ounces, of the Juice of Sorrel one ounce and an half, of Sugar of Roſes one ounce, boil them a little and ſtrain them. Let him take two ounces twice or thrice a Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Pain be very violent, Syrup of Poppies may be taken.</p>
                  <p>Let him uſe for his Drink Barley-water ſweetned with Syrup of Violets, which he muſt drink cold.</p>
                  <p>In Progreſs of the Diſeaſe, Medicines are to be mixed with the foregoing, which may help the Reſolution; to which end the following Julep may be preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Syrups of Water-lillies, of Apples, and of the Juice of Purſlain, each one ounce; of the Syrup of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Wormwood half an ounce, of the Waters of Sorrel, Lettice, and Fennel, each three ounces; of the Species Diamargarite frigid one dram; make a Julep for three Doſes to be taken twice a day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe may be added reſtorative Opiats, Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and the like; all which are to be varied according to the Judgment and Diſcretion of the Phyſician.</p>
                  <p>Turpentine waſhed in Wormwood-water taken twice or thrice, reſolves and ripens Impoſthumes of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
                  <p>The following Fomentation may be applyed outwardly in the beginning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:65404:116"/>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Sorrel two ounces, of the Leaves of Endive, Succory, and Mallows, each one handful; of the Seeds of Lettice, and of white Poppies, each three drams; of white and red Sanders, each half a dram; of the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Violets, and of Water-lillies, each one Pugil; make a Decoction, add to it a little Roſe-vinegar, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Region of the Stomach with it warm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Fomentation, anoint the part with Oyl of Roſes and Oyl of Violets mixed.</p>
                  <p>Cataplaſms are not convenient in the beginning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they oppreſs the part by their Weight, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Heat increaſe the Inflammation.</p>
                  <p>If the Diſeaſe come to a Declination, and if the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſhould be reſolved, which is moſt to be wiſhed for, a reſolving Fomentation may be applied made in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Florentine-orris two ounces, of the Leaves of Mint, Marjoram, Penny-royal, and of Roman Wormwood, each one Handful; of the Seeds of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>After the Fomentation, anoint the Part with Oyl of Nutmeg, Wormwood, Nard, and the like; to which Wax, and the Powder of Florentine-orris, and of Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon being added, an Oyntment may be made; but Plaiſters and Cataplaſms are not convenient, becauſe they oppreſs the Part.</p>
                  <p>But if the Tumour ſeem to tend to Suppuration, foment the part with a Decoction of the Flowers of Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, and red Roſes, and afterwards apply the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cataplaſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſh-mallows two ounces, of the Leaves of Bears-breech, and of Roſes, each one handful; boil them well, and then add of the Flower of Barley, and of Linſeeds, and Faenugreek-ſeeds, and of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of Camomil, each half an ounce; of white and red Sanders, each two drams; with Oyl of Roſes and of Camomil, and with a little Hens-greaſe, make a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm to be renewed often.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Abſceſs being broken, cleanſe the Ulcer by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hydromel, to which muſt be added ſometimes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Galen</hi>'s order, Manna of Frankincenſe, or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-water, with Sugar of Roſes in the beginning in a hot Conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>When the Ulcer grows old, from what cauſe ſoever it prooceeds, Broths are proper, altered with cooling, and moderately aſtringent Herbs, Barly-broths ſweetned with Sugar of Roſes, new Milk ſweetned with Sugar and a little Honey, Steel-waters for the ordinary drink, or Water wherein ſome Bole-armonick or ſealed Earth has been infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; to which may be added, a little red rough Wine, if there be but little Heat in the Part; afterward the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apozem may be uſed.</p>

                  <p>But if there be danger of a Conſumption, the foreſaid Root muſt be boiled in Chicken-broth, with the foreſaid Herbs, and with cleanſed Barley.</p>
                  <p>When the Ulcer has continued long, Chalybeat or Purging Waters drank for a Month do good; and gentle Catharticks, as Rubarb, and Tamarinds, Myrobalans, Syrup of Roſes, are to be uſed once a Week. Laſtly, The following things are to be uſed.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXX. Of the Chollick.</head>
                  <p>IT takes its name from the Gut Colon, which is the part affected, which is long and winding, and deſigned by Nature to receive the Excrements of almoſt all the Body; and when thoſe Excrements are retained too long, they are wont to occaſion Pains of this kind.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Cauſes of the Chollick is all Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Matter, that occaſions a Solution of the Continuum, either by diſtending, pricking, or corroding, and is either Wind or Humours.</p>
                  <p>Wlnd generated by Crudities, or from a cold Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries of the Stomach or Bowels, if it cannot be ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably excluded, by reaſon the Feces are very hard, or by reaſon the Inteſtines are obſtructed, it is heap'd up in a great quantity in the great Guts, eſpecially in the Colon, and occaſions violent Pain.</p>
                  <p>Thick Cold and Flegmatick Humours, ſtufft into the Tunicks of the Guts, may occaſion ſuch Pains by corroding them, if they are indued with Acrimony or by chilling them; which conſequently occaſions Coſtiveneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays of himſelf, that he having a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Chollick, evacuated glaſſy Flegm which was actually cold. Wind, which is eaſily elevated by a weak and gentle Heat from groſs and clammy Humours, may alſo occaſion this Pain.</p>
                  <p>Cholerick and Acrid Humours, and alſo Melancholly and Acid, may occaſion theſe Pains, by vellicating and pricking the Inteſtines: But in the Action of theſe Cauſes, it may be asked how the Chollick Pain ſhould have Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbations and Remiſſions, the ſame Matter remaining in the Bowels, which as long as it is there ſhould always bite and diſtend them. To which I anſwer, that that Matter does ſometimes remain quiet, and then it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions little or no Pain; but ſometimes is moved and excited by various Fermentations that happen to the Humours, as is wont to happen to the Falling-ſickneſs, Hyſterick Fits, and in Fits of Feavers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:65404:118"/>But we muſt take notice, that the Wind or Humours do not only reſide in the Cavity of the Inteſtines, for then they would be eaſily excluded by things that Evacuate and Cleanſe, and by Carminative Medicines; but moſt commonly they are fixed in the very Tunicks of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines; upon which account it is difficult to remove them, and ſo they occaſion an obſtinate Diſeaſe. The Groſs, Flegmatick and Melancholly Humours, flow by little and little through the Veins of the Inteſtines, and ſo do not preſently cauſe Pain, till there is a quantity ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to irritate Nature for their Expulſion, and then being moved cauſe Pain; or Wind occaſioned by them, and included in the Coats of the Inteſtines diſtends them, and not eaſily getting out occaſions a laſting Pain; alſo Choler after the ſame manner, poured through the Veins of the Inteſtines upon their Coats, and imbibed by them, cauſes violent Pains, which are wont to be long and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, becauſe it is difficultly removed from their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>There is another Species of a bilious Chollick, which degenerates into a Palſie, ſcarce known unto the Ancients, which proceeds from a bilious Humour, not poured as the former upon the Colon, but upon the Membranes of the Abdomen which is transferred thither, either from the Gall-Bladder, or from the Meſentery in the Criſis of long Feavers, or by reaſon of violent Anger, or ſome other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cauſe, when becauſe of Obſtructions it cannot be carried to the common Paſſages, but by a Prepoſterous Motion is put off ſuddenly upon the foreſaid Membranes of the Abdomen: And hence great Pain ariſes like the Chollick, which yields neither to Gliſters nor Fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor any other Remedy, but continues for many Months, by which the Body waſts, and the Sick is vexed with a ſort of intermitting Feaver, and often with a ſlow continual Feaver; at length the Pain remitting, a Palſie ſucceeds, that Humour leaſurely creeping through the Membranes of the Abdomen to the Spine of the Back; but this Palſie chiefly poſſeſſes the upper parts; yet there is moſt commonly a Pain in the Thighs and Legs, and in ſome few the uſe of them is wholly taken away, and ſometimes it breaks in upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:65404:119"/>There are other cauſes of the Chollick, but leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, <hi>viz.</hi> Stones growing in the Guts, Worms wound up in a bottom and obſtructing the Inteſtines, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Guts by a Tumour of the neighbouring parts, and the narrowneſs of them, by reaſon of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and other Tumours of the Guts, or a twiſting of them occaſioned by Wind, which is next to an Iliack Paſſion, and ſometimes the Matter which cauſes a Chollick is Venomous and Malignant. Laſtly, All hard Bodies, by obſtructing the Guts, or diſtending them, may occaſion a Chollick, as ſtones generated in the Guts, a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Cherry-ſtones, hard Cheeſe, and the like. As <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus</hi> relates of a certain Governour, a long while troubled with the Chollick and Convulſions, who after the uſe of Gliſters, evacuated a great quantity of hard Cheeſe by Stool.</p>
                  <p>The External Cauſes are a cold Conſtitution of the Air preſſing and hardning the Belly, or a hot Conſtitution which does likewiſe harden the Excrements, the uſe of Meat and Drink unfit for the Mans Conſtitution, of crud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and harſh Roots, and of groſs Meats of hard Digeſtion, too much reſt, immoderate Sleep, unſeaſonable Exerciſe, immoderate Venery, and other External Cauſes which may injure the Concoction of the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>The Diagnoſticks of this Diſeaſe are plain, for firſt the Pain is violent, ſometimes afflicting grievouſly this part, ſometimes that, ſometimes it poſſeſſes the Region of the Spleen, ſometimes of the Stomach or Liver, or of the Reins, ſometimes it is above, ſometimes below the Navel, and oftentimes it is moſt violent in the left ſide; the Patient often Vomits, the Pain is increaſed after Eating, the Belly is moſt commonly bound.</p>
                  <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are diſtinguiſhed in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, If the Pain proceed from Flegm, it is not violent, unleſs it be accompanied with Wind; the Sick is eaſed by hot things, and injured by cold things, a courſe of Diet before apt to increaſe Flegm preceded.</p>
                  <p>If the Chollick is occaſioned by Wind, there is a ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pain, and a certain Inflation of the Belly; the Sick perceive a great deal of Wind, and a rumbling in the Belly; they are much eaſed by breaking Wind, a courſe of Diet fit to breed Wind was uſed before, as unſeaſonably
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65404:119"/>
drinking cold Water, the frequent uſe of Pulſe, Turneps, and Cheſnuts, Herbs and Fruits, and the like; and if the the Wind be contained in the Cavity of the Inteſtins, the Pain is wandring, and not fixed to one part, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Intervals. But if it be kept in within the Coats of the Guts, the Pain is fixed and is continual and obſtinate becauſe it cannot find Vent.</p>
                  <p>If the Chollick proceeds from an acrid and Cholerick Humour, it is moſt ſharp, there is a twitching and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heat, Drouth, and for the moſt part a Feaver, the Diſeaſe is increaſed by hot Medicines and Diet, and is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated by cold.</p>
                  <p>By the following Signs the Chollick and Nephritick Pain may be diſtinguiſhed, if they are accurately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Nephritick Pain is fixed in the Kidney, and ſtretches it ſelf from that to the Teſtes according to the length of the Ureter, but the Chollick is wandring, and painfully girds the lower Belly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Chollick increaſes after eating, by reaſon of the preſſure upon the Gut by a full Stomach, but the Nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Pain is not at all increaſed after eating, but rather leſſened, becauſe ſome of the Nutritious Juice is carried to the Veins which ſomewhat aſſwages the Pain.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In the Chollick Vomiting is more ſevere, and the Belly is more bound, becauſe the Colon lies near the Bottom of the Stomach, and the Inteſtines being full or violently provoked, contract themſelves that they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the common Enemy; but either of the Symptoms is common to either of the Diſeaſes; ſo that the Intention or Remiſſion of them has a difficult Diagnoſtick.</p>
                  <p>For the Nephritick Pain being intenſe, may occaſion greater Vomiting, and bind the Belly more than a remiſs Chollick.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In the Chollick, the Patient is more eaſed by Vomiting and going to Stool, than in Nephirtick Pains,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In the Nephritick Pain, the Urine is firſt clear and thin, afterwards ſomething ſettles to the Bottom, and at length Sand or Gravel is evacuated; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the Chollick the Urine is thicker from the beginning.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe muſt be varied according to
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65404:120"/>
the Variety of the Cauſes: And firſt, There is the ſame Way of Cure for a Windy and Flegmatick Chollick, you muſt begin with an emollient Gliſter, and afterwards you muſt give a Carminative and diſcutient Gliſter, which muſt be repeated twice, thrice, or four times in a day, till the Pain be gone; but if after the uſe of one or two Gliſters, the Sick does not go to Stool, as ſometimes it happens, the Belly muſt be irritated by a ſharp Suppoſitory, but it is convenient to add to one of the Gliſters four ounces of the Aqua-benedicta, or two or three drams of Coloquintida may be boiled in an emolient and Carminative Gliſter.</p>
                  <p>If Gliſters do not give eaſe you muſt not obſtinately perſiſt in the uſe of them; for it has been obſerved, that when a Sick Perſon has taken, without any Succeſs, twenty Gliſters, another Phyſician having given only an ounce and an half of Manna, with two ounces of Oyl of Almonds in fat Broth has cured the Patient. But in that Pain which proceeds from thick Flegm, ſtronger Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines muſt be given.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards Fomentations, Oyntments, Baths, Plaiſters and other Remedies are uſeful, to which muſt be added ſome Specificks.</p>
                  <p>Boil ſimple Water, and when it is boiling hot, add a fourth part of common Oyl, and ſome grains of pepper groſly beaten. Let the Sick take three or four Spoonfuls as hot as he can bear it, the pain will be gone as it were in a Moment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the beſt Aloes one dram, of Laudanum Opiatum grains four; mingle them, make ſix Pills, gild them, let the Sick take them at a convenient time, they give eaſe in an hours Time, and afterwards purge off the nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious Humours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Inſtead of the Pills, a Potion may be taken made of half an ounce of Diaphaenicon, and two Scruples of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonium Romanum in the Water or Decoction, of Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Oyl of Almonds, or of ſome other Oyl, for poor People, four ounces; of generous Wine one ounce, of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Poppies one ounce; mingle ehem, make a Potion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:65404:120"/>Oyl of ſweet Almonds alſo taken with Manna in fat Broth aſſwages the Pain, and evacuates the Peccant Matter.</p>
                  <p>If the Diſeaſe is laſting, it may be ſucceſsfully treated with a Decoction of Guajacum continued for many Days, purging now and then with Elixir Salutis, and injecting Gliſters frequently.</p>
                  <p>But if the Chollick proceed from Flegm, boil the Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacum with Wine.</p>
                  <p>A Bilious Cholick is cured by emolient Gliſters, and with ſuch things as attemperate the Acrimony of the Humours.</p>
                  <p>Give Juleps of the Waters of Erratick Poppy, of Lettice and Sorrel, with the Syrups of Violets, Apples, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: If the Pain is very violent we muſt uſe Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; the Pain being ſomewhat mitigated.</p>
                  <p>An Infuſion of Rubarb in Succory-water is to be given with Syrup of Roſes, and to be repeated often, till the Stock of Matter is evacuated. If gentle Purging be not ſufficient to eradicate the Diſeaſe, we muſt uſe Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Dulcis, which being given ſometimes with purging Medicines that have Diagridium in them perfects the Cure.</p>
                  <p>They that diſlike Diagridium, may give Mercurius Dulcis alone made into Pills, with Conſerve of Roſes, drinking upon them an Infuſion of Rubarb and Senna, with Manna, and Syrup of Roſes added to it.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards it will be convenient to uſe <hi>Tunbridge</hi> or ſuch like Waters.</p>
                  <p>When the Pain is violent, you muſt fly to Laudanum, with which Catharticks may be ſometimes given, but in a large Doſe, becauſe they are much blunted by Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding is ſometimes proper in this ſort of Chollick, when there is danger, leaſt the Violence of the Heat ſhould occaſion a Feaver; if there be a Feaver already it is preſently to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>When there is a great Drouth cold Water muſt be given, according to <hi>Galens</hi> Inſtruction. And <hi>Amatus Luſitanus</hi> ſays, he wonderfully cured of a ſudden ſuch a Pain by the uſe of it; and <hi>Septalius</hi> declares, in two Obſervations, that he uſed it inwardly and outwardly with great Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>For the Cure of a Chollick that degenerates into a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

put the Patient into a warm Bath, made of a Decoction of emollient things, the Belly being looſned with various Gliſters, and the firſt Paſſages opened by Catharticks, the Patient muſt be bathed twice or thrice, or four or five times in a day, that the Acrimony of the Humours may be attemperated, and that the Pores of the Membranes may be opened. The next day let the Humour be purged with ſome proper Cathartick, and then the Bath muſt be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo you muſt do every other day, if the Patient be able to bear it, till the Humours being purged off, and the pain quieted, he is recovered.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time you muſt continue the uſe of Gliſters, but thoſe made with Milk are beſt to aſſwage the Pain, to which may be added Caſſia, Oyl of Violets, and Oyl of Lillies.</p>
                  <p>Let the Belly be frequently anointed with Oyl of Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil, of Dill, ſweet Almonds, Lillies, and with Butter. Laſtly, Uſe Whey and <hi>Tunbridge</hi>-waters, or the like; and if the Diſeaſe continues a long while, thoſe things may be uſed which are proper to cure Hypochondriack Melancholly; and Bleeding is to be uſed at the beginning of the Diſeaſe, and before Purging, and to be often repeated, if the Blood ſeem to be bad, or if ſomething of a Rheumatiſm ſeems to be joyned wtih it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, All thoſe Remedies which are propoſed for the Cure of a Bilious Chollick may be uſed in this Caſe; and if theſe things do no good, ſome Phyſicians preſcribe the following Potion, which though it be loathſome, and will not go down with the delicate, yet they ſay it preſently mitigates the Pain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Horſe-dung one ounce, crumble it in ſmall Pieces, and infuſe it in a Pint of Erratick Poppy-water, to which add eight or ten drops of Spirit of Wine. Strain it gently, and divide it into three Doſes to be taken when the Pain is moſt violent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Diſeaſe degenerates into a Palſie, you muſt uſe to the Spine of the Back, and the paralitick Parts, ſome reſolving Balſam, and ſuch an one as ſtrengthens the Nerves, if there be a Feaver; but if there be no Feaver, you may apply Wooll dipt in Oyl or Ointment to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitick

                  <p>IN all theſe Years the Blood was much inclined to put off upon the Bowels hot and Cholerick Humours, upon which Account this Chollick was more frequent than is uſual: The ſame Febrile Symptoms preceded this Diſeaſe as uſed to go before the Dyſentery, that reigned in thoſe times; and ſometimes this Diſeaſe followed the Dyſentery, when it had a long while afflicted the Patient, and was juſt about to leave him; but when it did not follow a long Dyſentery, it generally took its Riſe from a Feaver, which after ſome Hours was wont to end in this Diſeaſe; it chiefly ſeiſed Young People of a hot and Cholerick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, eſpecially in the Summer the Pain of the Bowels was extreamly violent, and more intollerable than any other that afflicts poor Mortals; it ſometimes binds as it were the Guts, and ſometimes being contracted to a Point, it bores like an Auger; the Pain now and then remits, and preſently the Fit approaches again, which as ſoon as the Patient perceives, he looks ſadly, and bemoans himſelf, as if it were actually upon him. At the beginning of this Diſeaſe the Pain is not ſo certainly determined to one Point, as in the Progreſs of it; nor is the Vomiting ſo frequent, or does the Belly ſo obſtinately reſiſt Catharticks; but the more the Pain is increaſed, the more pertinaciouſly is it fixed in a Point, the Vomiting is more frequent, and the Belly more bound, till at length by the dreadful Force of theſe Symptoms, a total ſubverſion of the Periſtaltick Motion of the Guts, if the Patient be not relieved; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence an Iliack Paſſion is procured, in which Diſeaſe all purging Medicines become preſently Emetick, and Gliſters that are injected are vomited up with the Excrements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="230" facs="tcp:65404:122"/>The Matter that is caſt up after this Manner, if it be ſincere, and without mixture, is ſometimes green, and ſometimes Yellow, and ſometimes of an unuſual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                  <p>In order to the Cure, I bleed freely in the Arm, if no Blood has been taken away before, and after two or three Hours I give an Anodyne; the next day I preſcribe ſome gentle Purge, and order that it ſhould be repeated. The next day ſave one, and ſometimes thrice, according as the Relicks of the Humour are more or leſs.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt take notice, that if this Diſeaſe proceeds from eating too much Fruit, or from any Meat of hard Digeſtion, upon which account ill and corrupted Juices are firſt tranſmitted to the Blood, and afterwards to the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els: I ſay in this Caſe the Stomach muſt be waſhed with large draughts of Poſſet-drink, which muſt be vomited up again; which being done, an Anodyne muſt be given and the next Day a Vein muſt be opened; and as to other things, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

A lenitive purging Potion of the Infuſion of Tamarinds, of the Leaves of Senna, and Rubarb, in which may be diſſolved Manna, and Syrup of Roſes, is to be preferred before other Catharticks, for it leaſt exagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and moves the Humours; but if the Sick cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Liquid Medicine by reaſon of an Averſion, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Vomiting, you muſt neceſſarily uſe Pills; among which the Pill Coch pleaſes me beſt, for they paſs beſt through the Body in this, and in moſt other Caſes. But when the Weakneſs of the Stomach, or the Vomiting is ſo great, that the Pills cannot be retained, then I firſt order an Anodyne, and a few hours after a Purge; but there muſt be ſo much ſpace betwixt them, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick be not quelled by the Narcotick, and ſo rendred ineffectual; but that it may continue ſo long in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach

as is neceſſary for its imparting its purgative Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to it, that it may operate when the Vertue of the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotick is ſpent, though the purge, if it could be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently done, is beſt given a long while after the Anodyn, for twelve hours after taking it, the patient is difficultly purged.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe in this, as well as in moſt other Diſeaſes wherein Narcoticks are indicated, a purge always increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the pain (at leaſt when it has done working, for while it is in Operation the patient is not ſo ill) therefore I uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally give an Anodyne as ſoon as the purge has done work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I order to be taken Morning and Evening daily betwixt the purges, that I may the more certainly appeaſe the pain, till the patient has been ſufficiently purged.</p>
                  <p>The purging of the Humours being over, I endeavour to bridle the Fury of the Diſeaſe (which now only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be done) by giving an Anodyne conſtantly Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening, which muſt be ſometimes repeated oftner; nor could I ever take off violent Pains without a larger Doſe than is uſual, and that repeated too; for that which is ſufficient to vanquiſh another Diſeaſe, will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inſufficient in this Caſe, the violence of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſubduing the force of the Medicine: And it is indeed ſafe to repeat Narcoticks, while ſuch a Pain as this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues violent, but not when it is gone off. Wherefore I repeat the Anodyne according to the degree of the Pain till it ceaſes, or till it be very much leſſened.</p>
                  <p>Yet there muſt be ſuch a Space of Time between them, that you may find what may be hoped for from the former Doſe, before another be given; but for the moſt part unleſs the Pain be very violent, a Paregorick given Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening may be ſufficient. Liquid Laudanum is the Anodyne I chiefly uſe, whereof I give Sixteen Drops in ſome cordial Water; or the doſe may be increaſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the violence of the Pain. But here I muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh you, that though I have ſaid Bleeding and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging muſt neceſſarily precede this quieting Method, yet ſometimes upon occaſion both being omitted, you muſt begin with Anodynes.</p>
                  <p>For Inſtance, when by reaſon of ſome preceding Sickneſs, large Evacuations have been uſed not long before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65404:123"/>
of the Chollick, for many Times they who have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of another Diſeaſe have fell ſuddenly into this, by reaſon of the Weakneſs of the Bowels; eſpecially if there be a great degree of Heat occaſioned by drinking of Wine or ſome other Spiritous Liquor immoderately; I ſay in this Caſe, it is not only unneceſſary, but I think it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, to give Catharticks again; for by them new Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults will be raiſed. Moreover, The Guts are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſufficiently cleanſed by Gliſters frequently uſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Phyſician is adviſed with; ſo that partly for this cauſe, and partly by reaſon of the long continuance of the Diſeaſe, Narcoticks ſeem in a manner to be only uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this pain of it's own Nature is wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn more than any other, all Occaſions of its Relapſe muſt be prevented, by giving an Anodyne twice a day for ſome days; but if as often as the Narcotick is intermitted, the pain now and then returns, as it ſometimes happens, I do not know any thing that will ſo certainly perfect the Cure, as riding on Horſeback, or in a Coach, with which the Patient muſt take long Journies; and in the mean while an Anodyne muſt be given conſtantly Morning and Evening. But Riding muſt not be uſed before the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent has been well purged, and then it muſt be continued for many Days.</p>
                  <p>If the Patient be young, and of a hot Conſtitution, I order a cooling and thickning Diet, ſuppoſe Pulp of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Panada, and the like; and every third Day, if the Stomach is craving, a Chick or a Whiteing boiled; and I allow no other Drink than ſmall Beer, or Milk-water, and this is all I order, unleſs Riding neceſſary to recover the Health requires more nouriſhing Food, and more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Liquor, whereby the Spirits exhauſted by Exerciſe may be repaired.</p>
                  <p>But when the Diſeaſe, being unskilfully treated, has a long while afflicted the Patient, ſo that the Bowels become weak and infirm, and he is in a manner quite waſted, I ſay in this Caſe we find by experience, that the free uſe of Epidemick Water, or of Aqua-mirabilis, or any other the Patient likes beſt, relieves him at this Time beyond Expectation,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:65404:123"/>Moreover, As in the Cure of the Diſeaſe, ſo when it is over, the thin Diet we have mentioned muſt be obſerved for ſome time; for this Diſeaſe being more apt to return than any other, and ſeating it ſelf upon the principle parts of Concoction, the leaſt error in this kind will preſently occaſion much Pain: Wherefore in this and all other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Bowels, Meats of hard Digeſtion are carefully to be avoided, and things of eaſie Digeſtion muſt be taken only in ſuch a Quantity as will ſuffice to ſuſtain Life.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXXII. Of the Hyſterick Chollick.</head>
                  <p>A Certain kind of Hyſterick Diſeaſe afflicts ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men very like the Bilious Chollick, both as to the Sharpneſs and Situation of the Pain; and alſo upon the account of the Humours ejected by Vomit of a Yellow and green Colour. But leaſt any one ſhould take it for the Bilious Chollick juſt now mentioned, I will treat of it in a Chapter by it Self.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Women that are of a lax and crude Habit of Body, are chiefly afflicted with this Diſeaſe; and they that have lately laboured under ſome other Hyſterick Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, (or which is very often) thoſe that have ſcarce evaded a difficult and hard Labour in bringing forth a large Child, whereby the Mothers Natural Strength has been almoſt Spent.</p>
                  <p>A Pain, as violent almoſt as that of the Chollick or Iliack Paſſion, ſeiſes the Region of the Stomach; and ſometimes it comes a little lower, and then violent Vomitings follow, and the Matter which is caſt up is ſometimes yellow, and ſometimes green. And moreover, (which I have often obſerved) there is a greater Dejection of Spirit, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, than in any other Diſeaſe whatever. After a day or two the Pain goes off, and returns again in a few Weeks after as violent as it was before; ſometimes it is accompanied with the Jaundice, which is very viſible, and which goes off of its own accord in a few days, when all
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65404:124"/>
the Symptoms are gone off; and when the Patient ſeems very well, the Smalleſt Diſorder of Mind, whether it be occaſioned by Anger or Sorrow (to both which in this Caſe Women are very prone) almoſt recalls the Pain, which may be ſaid of walking, or any other Exerciſe uſed too ſoon, for by theſe means Vapours are elevated in a Lax and weak Habit of Body; when according to the Vulgar Opinion I ſay Vapours, whither they be ſo or no, or whither they are Convulſions of particular parts, the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena may be ſolved either way. Theſe Vapours or Convulſions, when they invade this or that Region of the Body, produce Symptoms agreeable to the part they invade, and though they are one and the ſame Diſeaſe every where, yet they cunningly reſemble moſt of the Diſeaſes Mankind is expoſed to.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding and Purging repeated, which were plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated at the beginning of a Bilious Chollick, are not to be uſed here, but the whole Buſineſs muſt be done by Anodyns, unleſs a great Quantity of Blood and Humours ſo reſiſts the operation of the Narcotick, that though it be often repeated, it cannot quell the Tumult, till the Patient is blooded and purged, which I have obſerved in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of a very ſanguine Conſtitution, and in Virago's. If the Caſe is ſo, Bleeding or Purging, or perchance both, muſt make Way for the Anodyne; for either of theſe being uſed, a moderate doſe of the Narcotick will perform the Buſineſs, which otherwiſe would ſignifie nothing, though the largeſt Doſe is given: But this ſeldom happens, and theſe Remedies muſt not be repeated; and when they are uſed, when there is need of them, you muſt proceed in giving Anodynes in that Method which I have propoſed in the Bilious Chollick; and they muſt be taken often or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom according to the degrees of Pain. But for as much as this Diſeaſe, in Hypochondriack as well as in Hyſterick People, often ends in the Jaundice, and as this comes on that goes off, we muſt take notice that in curing this kind of Jaundice, all Catharticks are to be wholly omitted; or if they are given, you muſt uſe only Rubarb, or ſome other gentle Purge; for there is danger leaſt by purging new Tumults ſhould ariſe, and ſo all the Symptoms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and therefore in this Caſe nothing muſt be done preſently, ſeeing the Jaundice taking its Riſe on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65404:124"/>
generally leſſens of its own accord, and wholly vaniſhes in a ſhort time: But if it continues a long while and ſeems to go off difficultly, Remedies muſt be taken for it. I uſe the following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Madder, and of Turmerick, each one ounce; of all the greater Celandine, and of the Tops of the leſſer Centaury, each one handful; boil them in equal parts of Rheniſh-wine, and of Fountain Water to a quart; in the Liquor ſtrained diſſolve two ounces of the Syrup of the five opening Roots; mingle them, make an Apozem. Let the Patient take half a pint Morning and Evening till he is well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Jaundice comes of it ſelf, the Chollick not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before it is neceſſary, beſides the alteratives juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                  <p>To give Cholagogues, that is ſuch things as purge Choler by Stool, <hi>viz.</hi> once or twice before the Patient enters upon the Apozem preſcribed, and afterwards once a Week, as long as he takes it. As,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Electuary of the Juice of Roſes two drams, of Rubarb finely powdered half a dram, of Cream of Tartar one ſcruple; make a Bolus with a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Rubarb with Succory; give it early in the Morning; let the Patient drink upon it a ſmall draught of Rheniſh-wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if notwithſtanding the conſtant taking of theſe things a long while, the Diſeaſe continues obſtinate, the Patient muſt drink <hi>Tunbridge</hi>-waters, or ſuch like, from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain every Morning till he recovers.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXXIII. Of the Iliack Paſſion.</head>
                  <p>THis dreadful Diſeaſe being hitherto almoſt in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all Mortal, takes its Riſe from the inverted and prepoſterous Motion of the Inteſtines, to wit, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the Inteſtines, which ought to be contracted from the Superior toward the Inferior, are drawn to the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; and whatſoever is contained in the Inteſtines, is not protruded to the Belly, but towards the Stomach, and is violently regurgitated to the Mouth, ſo that Gliſters, how ſharp ſoever become vomitive; and alſo Catharticks taken by the Mouth are ſuddenly caſt up by Vomit. And in my Opinion, the exquiſite and intollerable Pain coming upon this Diſeaſe, is only occaſioned by the foreſaid prepoſterous Motion of the Inteſtines; for whereas thoſe Folds, which the many Circumvolutions of the Inteſtines make, are ſo formed by Nature, that they ſhould moſt fitly conduce to the carrying down of the Faeces: When they, I ſay, are forced to give way to a Motion contrary to their Fibres, the aforeſaid Pain is occaſioned from thence, which is fixed to one part, and is like the boreing of an Auger, when either the Valve, which is placed at the Beginning of the Colon, hinders the going back of the Excrements to the Ilion, or any other Membrane belonging to the Sinus ſuſtains alone the Force of this prepoſterous Impulſe.</p>
                  <p>We may aſſign a twofold Cauſe of this Inverſion, from whence the Pain ariſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Obſtruction and Iritation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, Whatever violently obſtructs the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, ſo that nothing can paſs downwards, neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces this contrary Motion in them. Among theſe Authors are wont to reckon the Excrements hardened, groſs Wind collected in a great quantity, and tying up as it were the Inteſtines, the Conſtriction of them in a Rupture: And laſtly An Inflammation, and other great Tumours, which ſtop up the Internal Cavity of the Inteſtine. In the mean time we muſt not deny, that this contrary Motion, owing its
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65404:125"/>
riſe to theſe Cauſes, is rather to be accounted the Motion of theſe things taken in, than of the Inteſtines; nor is this an Inverſion of the whole Duct of the Inteſtines, but only of thoſe which are ſituated above the Seat of that Obſtruction; wherefore I call an Iliack Paſſion proceeding hence ſpurious.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I think that in the Iliack Paſſion, the cauſe of the Inverſion of the Periſtaltick Motion of the Inteſtines, is moſt commonly after this Manner, <hi>viz.</hi> Sharp and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Humours are caſt upon the Stomach, and the Guts that are next to it, by which the Motion of the Stomach is inverted, and forced violently to caſt up what is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it; at length the ſmall Guts that are joined to the Stomack being weakned, yield to the violent Motion of it, and with them at laſt the greater follow by Conſent; the Stomach Vomiting, leading as it were the Dance, this I call a true Iliack Paſſion, and which is treated of now.</p>
                  <p>The Method of cureing it has been hitherto in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner unknown, whatever ſome boaſt of the uſe of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver and Bullets, which beſides that they do little good, are very oft injurious.</p>
                  <p>I have ſucceſsfully uſed the following Method,</p>
                  <p>When it appears by Gliſters caſt up by the Mouth, and other Signs, that it is a true Iliack Paſſion, I endeavour theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the contrary Motion of the Stomach, which cauſes the like Motion of the Guts, may be hindred. Secondly, That the Inteſtines being weakned by the ſharp Humour may be corroborated. Thirdly, That the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Guts be freed from theſe Humours. And that I may Anſwer theſe Indications, I inſtitute the Cure after this Manner. Firſt, I preſcribe one Scruple of Salt of Wormwood in a ſpoonful of Juice of Lemons to be taken Morning and Evening; but at other times of the Day I order ſome ſpoonfuls of Mint Water, without Sugar or any thing elſe, to be taken twice in an Hour; by the repeated uſe of which alone, the Vomiting and the Pain ariſing from thence will ſoon vaniſh. At the ſame time I order a living Kitling to lie continually upon the naked Belly. But after the Pain and Vomiting has wholly ceaſed for the Space of two or three Days, I give one dram of the Pill Coch-major
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65404:126"/>
diſſolved in Mint-water, which I alſo order to be uſed very often, all the time of the working of the Pills, that I may the more certainly hinder the Return of the Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; nor is the Kitling to be removed, before the Patient has taken the Pills.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved, that it is to no purpoſe to give theſe Pills, or any other Purge, how ſtrong ſoever, until the Stomack is ſtrengthned, and reduced to its Natural Motion, and the Guts alſo to that which is proper to them; for otherwiſe all Catharticks taken inwardly would prove Emetick, and ſo do more hurt than good, and therefore I do not uſe Purging Medicines, until for ſome Time I have uſed thoſe Medicines which reſpect the Stomach.</p>
                  <p>I preſcribe a very thin Diet, for I allow onely ſome ſpoonfuls of Chicken-broath to be taken twice or thrice a day; in the mean while I order the Patient to keep his Bed all the Time of the Sickneſs, till the Signs of perfect Health appear; and when he is well I appoint him to perſiſt in the uſe of the foreſaid Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a long Time, and to keep his Belly warm with Flannels doubled, that there may not be a Relapſe where unto this Diſeaſe is very prone.</p>

                  <p>BY Coſtiveneſs we do not underſtand a pefect Stoppage of the Belly, ſo that nothing is evacuated downwards as happens in the Iliack Paſſion, but only a ſlow and unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Evacuation that Way, whereby the Excrements, and the Relicts of the Meat are ſeldom ejected, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the quantity taken in.</p>
                  <p>When the Belly is bound, Vapours ariſe to the Head, and Catarrhs and Diſeaſes of the Brain are produced, the Concoction is hindred, and the Actions of other Parts.</p>

                  <p>There are many Cauſes of the Lientery and Caeliack Paſſion propoſed by Authors, all which may be reduced to three Heads; <hi>viz.</hi> A cold Intemperies of the Stomach and Inteſtines; an Irritation of thoſe Parts, and a great Debility of the retentive Faculty, from a grievous and deadly Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>There is another Cauſe different from thoſe mentioned, which uſes peculiarly to produce the Caeliack Paſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Obſtruction of the Meſeraick Veins, whhich ſtops the Paſſage of the Chyle. <hi>Aetius</hi> and <hi>Celſus,</hi> and many of their followers, do propoſe another Cauſe of the Lientery, <hi>viz.</hi> A hard Cicatrix upon the Inteſtines produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a Dyſentery,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That which proceeds from a bilious Humour, is to be cured with the following Remedies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the beſt Aloes waſhed in Roſe-water three drams, of Rubarb powdered and moiſtened with Borrage-water one dram, of Maſtich, red Sanders, red Coral prepared, each one ſcruple; of Syrup of Roſes ſolutive a ſufficient quantity; make a Maſs for Pills, of which let the Sick take half a dram, or one dram at a time.</hi>

                  <p>There is another Species of a Diarrhea which is called colliquative, ariſing from the Colliquation of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Body.</p>
                  <p>If a Diarrhea be critical, and is eaſily born, and the Diſeaſe goes off by it, or is greatly diminiſhed, the Sick is benefited by it.</p>
                  <p>But if a Diarrhea be Symptomatical, it occaſions a great deal of Pain to the Sick, the Strength greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, and the Diſeaſe upon which it comes is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly augmented, or at leaſt does not decreaſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure a Symptomatick Diarrhea riſes for the moſt part from bad and corrupted Humours, therefore the Cure of it is to be begun with the Evacuation of the Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Humour.</p>

                  <p>A Vomit is alſo ſometimes convenient, becauſe it makes a Revulſion and Evacuation of the Morbiſick Matter.</p>
                  <p>If there be Signs of abundance of Blood, and the Body being ſtrong, Bleeding is neceſſary in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXXVI. Of the Bloody Flux.</head>
                  <p>SOmetimes it begins with ſhaking and ſhivering, and Heat of the whole Body follows, as is uſual in Feavers, and ſoon after the Gripes and Stools; but oftentimes there is no Appearance of a Feaver going before, for the Gripes begin and Stools ſoon follows; but there are always great Gripes, and a Depreſſion of the Bowels with Pain, when the Patient goes to Stool; the Stools are frequent, with a very troubleſome Deſcent as it were of the Guts, and they are all mucous, not excrementitious, excepting that ſometimes an excrementitious Stool comes between, and that is without any great Pain, theſe mucous Stools are ſtreaked with Blood, yet ſometimes there is no Blood at all mixt with them through the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe, yet notwithſtanding, if the Stools are frequent with Gripes and a mucous Filth, the Diſeaſe may be as properly called a Dyſentery, as if Blood flow'd with them.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, The Sick, if he be in the Flower of his Age, or is heated by Cordials, has a Feaver, and his Tongue is covered thick with a kind of whitiſh Matter; and if he has been much heated 'tis black and dry; the Strength is much dejected, the Spirits are diſſipated, and all the Signs of an ill favoured Feaver are preſent.</p>
                  <p>And this Diſeaſe does not only occaſion dreadful Pains and Sickneſs, but, unleſs it be skilfully managed, it brings the Patient into great Danger of his Life; for when a great many of the Spirits, and a great deal of the vital Heat, have been exhauſted by frequent Stools, before the peccant Matter can be caſt out of the Blood, his Hands and Feet growing cold, he will be in danger of dying; and if he ſhould eſcape Death this time, yet many Symptoms of a different kind attend the Poor Wretch. For Inſtance, Sometimes in the Progreſs of the Diſeaſe, inſtead of thoſe Sanguineous Filaments which at the beginning us'd to be mixed with the Stools, pure Blood is evacuated unmingled with Slime, and in a larger quantity at every Time which is an Argument that ſome of the greater Veſſels of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65404:130"/>
the Inteſtines are corroded, and ſo the Patient is in danger of Death: And ſometimes alſo, by reaſon of the great Burning which is occaſioned by a large Flux of hot and ſharp Matter to the Parts affected, the Inteſtines are gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gren'd. Moreover, a Thruſh at the end of the Diſeaſe does very often affect the Mouth and Jaws, eſpecially when the Body has been a long Time heated, and when the Evacuation of the peccant Matter has been hindred by aſtringent Medicines, the Fomes of the Diſeaſe having not been firſt purged off,; and this is moſt commonly the forerunner of Death; but if the Patient get over the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Symptoms, and the Diſeaſe continues long, at length the Inteſtines ſeem to be affected ſucceſſively downwards, till the Diſeaſe be thruſt down into the right Gut, and ends in a Teneſmus. But tho this Diſeaſe is very often deadly in grown People, but eſpecially to ancient People, yet 'tis very gentle in Children, who ſometimes have it ſome Months, without any Injury, if it be left to Nature.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, When I was firſt called, I bled in the Arm, and at Night I gave an Anodyne, and the next Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the following lenitive Purge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Tamarinds half an ounce, of the Leaves of Senna two drams, of Rubarb one dram and an half, boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Water, in three ounces of the ſtrained Liquor, diſſolve of Manna, and of Syrup of Roſes ſolutive, each an ounce; to be taken early in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And becauſe 'tis very obvious, that purging Medicines, tho they be never ſo gentle, do heighten the Gripes, and cauſe a general Diſorder and Depreſſion of the Spirits, by the Adventitious Tumult they raiſe in the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, therefore I uſually give an Anodyne after every Purge ſomewhat earlier than is cuſtomary, <hi>viz.</hi> At any time of the Afternoon if the Purge ſeem to have done work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby I may be able to quiet the Tumult I have raiſed. I repeat the foreſaid Purge twice, to be taken every other Day, and give an Anodyne after every Purge at the Time above mentioned, and I order this to be us'd Morning and Evening when the Patient don't Purge, that
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65404:130"/>
I may quell the violence of the Symptoms, and gain a Truce while I am evacuating the peccant Humours. The Anodyne I uſe is chiefly Liquid Laudanum, <hi>viz.</hi> Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or eighteen Drops of it in any Cordial-water for one Doſe.</p>
                  <p>After Bleeding and Purging once uſed, I allow through the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe, any temperate Cordial to be taken now and then, as Epidemick-water, compound Scordium-water, and the like. For Inſtance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Black-cherries and Strawberries, each four ounces; of Epidemick-water, and compound Scordium water, and of Cinnamon-water hordeated, each one ounce; of prepared Pearls one dram and an half, of Chriſtaline Sugar a ſufficient quantity, add half a dram of Damask-roſe-water to make it pleaſant to the Taſte, mingle them, and make a Julep, of which let him take four or five ſpoonfuls when he is faint, and any other time when he will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I chiefly uſed theſe things in ancient and Flegmatick People, that I might ſomewhat refreſh and comfort their Spirits uſually dejected in this Diſeaſe: their Drink was Milk mixt with three times the quantity of Water, or the white Decoction of Harts-horn, and of white-bread, each two ounces, boyled in three Pints of Fountain-water to two, and ſweetned with a ſufficient quantity of white Sugar, and ſometimes Poſſet-drink; and when they were very weak, they took for their ordinary drink cold, a quart of Fountain-water boiled with half a Pint of Sack; they were dieted ſometimes with Panada, and ſometimes with Broths made of lean Mutton. I kept ancient People much in Bed, and permitted them to uſe more freely any Cordial-water they had been accuſtomed to, than was fit for Young People and Infants. This Method was the beſt I have hitherto met with for the Cure of this Diſeaſe, which ſeldom laſted after the third Purge.</p>
                  <p>But if the Diſeaſe was obſtinate, and did not yield to theſe things, I preſcribed the foreſaid Paregorick every day in the Morning and at bed-time, till the Patient was quite well; yea, that it might be the more certainly quelled, I gave the foreſaid Laudanum every eighth Hour, and a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65404:131"/>
larger Doſe than I have mentioned above, <hi>viz.</hi> twenty five drops, if the former Doſe was not ſufficient to ſuppreſs the Flux. Moreover, I ordered a Glyſter made of half a a pint of Cows-milk, and of an ounce and an half of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice-treacle, to be injected daily, which is exceeding beneficial in all manner of Fluxes of the Belly.</p>
                  <p>Infants ſeized with this Diſeaſe are to be treated after the ſame manner, but the quantity of Blood to be taken away, and the Doſes of the Purging and Anodyne Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are to be leſſened with reſpect to their Age, ſo for example, two drops of the Narcotick may be ſufficient for a Child of a Year old.</p>
                  <p>The Liquid Laudanum, which as was ſaid, I daily us'd, was prepared according to this eaſie Method.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Spaniſh-wine one Pint, Opium two ounces, of Saffron one ounce, of the Powder of Cinnamon, and of Cloves, each one dram; let them be infuſed together in a Bath for two or three days, till the Liquor come to a due Conſiſtence, ſtrain it, and keep it for uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Dry-gripe Dyſentery, I uſed the following Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. If the Patient was in the Flower of his Age, and had a Feaver, I ordered him to be bled in the Arm, and after an hour or two, that he ſhou'd take great quantities of Liquor, as I us'd to do in the <hi>Cholera Morbus,</hi> but not Chicken-broth, or Poſſet-drink, as in that Caſe, but Whey, which I ordered to be drank cold in the ſame quantity as in the <hi>Cholera</hi>; but the Gliſters were to be injected warm, without Sugar, or any other thing; I found the Gripes and the bloody Stools went off, with the fourth Gliſter: This Buſineſs being over, and all the Whey ejected (which might be done in the Space of two or three Hours, if the Sick minded his Buſineſs) I preſently put him to Bed, where he ſoon ſweated of his own Accord (by reaſon of the Whey mixt with the Blood) and I ordered it ſhould be continued for twenty four hours, but not at all provoked, allowing him all the while nothing but Milk a little warmed, which he only uſed three or four days after he left his Bed. If either by riſing too ſoon, or by leaving the uſe of Milk too ſoon, the Patient relapſes, the ſame Method is to be repeated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:65404:131"/>To conclude, 'Tis to be noted, that tho in thoſe Years wherein the Bloody-flux is Epidemical, the foreſaid Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations are wholly neceſſary before we come to the uſe of Laudanum, yet in any Conſtitution, not favouring ſo much this Diſeaſe, they may be ſafely omitted, and the Cure may be performed more compendiouſly by Laudanum alone in the manner we have deſcribed.</p>

                  <p>A Teneſmus is a continual Motion to go to Stool, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by nothing but a mucous Matter is evacuated.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſe of this Diſeaſe is an Ulcer of the right Gut, from whence a purulent Matter continually flows, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritates the expulſive Faculty. It is not dangerous, unleſs it proceed from black Choler, and ſo ſhou'd turn to a Cancer, or ſhould occaſion Miſcarriage in Women with Child.</p>
                  <p>The manner of Cure is much the ſame with that of the Bloody-flux. If there be an Inflammation (which is chiefly known by a Feaver) or an abundance of Blood, Bleeding muſt be us'd; and if the Inflammation remains after Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and occaſion a Strangury (which ſometimes happens) Bleeding by Leeches in the Hemorrhoidal Veins is bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial.</p>
                  <p>Gliſters are alſo to be Injected according to the various Seaſons of the Ulcer, ſometimes thoſe that are lenient when the Pain is violent, ſometimes cleanſing, glutinating, or aſtringent; but in giving Gliſters you muſt obſerve, firſt, that they muſt be given often and in a ſmall quantity, becauſe 'tis difficult to keep them, and then the Pipe muſt be put up gently, leaſt it ſhould anger the part and cauſe Pain.</p>
                  <p>And the part muſt be well fomented and Bathed, and Fumes, Suppoſitories and Oyntments muſt be us'd to it; a Fomentation may be made in the following manner.</p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:65404:132"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves of Mullein, and Wormwood, each ſix handfulls; boil them in new Milk, and put them into two Bags, and apply them hot by turns to the Fundament and Belly.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Or fill two Bags with wheat-bran, and boil them in Vinegar, let the Sick ſit hot upon them by turns, as he can bear them. If much Blood be evacuated, you may make a Fomentation in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves and Roots of Mullein two handfuls, of red Roſes one Pugil, of the Bark of Pomegranates, and of Gauls, each half an ounce; boil them in two Parts of Smiths Water, and in one of red Wine, 'twill be more powerful if you add half an ounce of Alum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Bath to eaſe the Pain muſt be made of Emollients boyled in a Decoction of Sheeps-feet, and if the Heat be much, Violets, Night-ſhade, Goards, and pieces of Melons may be added: But to heal the Ulcer, a Bath muſt be made of Aſtringents; Fumes are proper to dry the Ulcer, made of Frankincenſe caſt on Coals, or of a Decoction of Savine made with Oxycrate; the following is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by <hi>Foreſtus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Maſtich one dram, of Frankincenſe one Scruple, of Mirtles one dram and an half, of red Roſes two ſcruples, make a Fume to be received through a Chair that has a hole at the Bottom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppoſitories do much good in this Caſe, but they ought to be gentle, leaſt they ſhould exaſperate the ſenſible Part; they may be made of Goats Suet cut into the Form of a Suppoſitory; for it gives Eaſe and heals the Ulcer; but it will be more powerful to eaſe the Pain, if you mix with it the Seeds of white Poppies, and of Henbane bruiſed;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65404:132"/>
but tis much better to add, inſtead of the Seeds, three drops of the Oyls preſſed from the Seeds, or a grain of Opium diſſolved in half a Scruple of Oyl of Almonds.</p>
                  <p>But to heal the Ulcer, 'tis beſt to add to the Suet diſſolved, Starch, and Gum-tragacanth beat or infuſed firſt in Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane-water; or it may be compounded in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Gum-Tragacanth as much as is ſufficient, pour upon it a little Plantain-water, that it may only ſwell, and not be too moiſt; add the Mucilage of the Seeds of Pſyllium, or of Quinces a ſufficient quantity, and the Yolk of one Egg, mingle them and make them warm; and of melted wax a ſufficient quantity, to make Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. Narcoticks may be alſo added, and the Powders of Ceruſs, Tutty, Bole, Balauſtines, and other things that dry, and are not acrimonious, when there is a great Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſion, but they ought to be finely powdered least they ſhould cauſe Pain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oyls and Oyntments may be alſo applied, as Oyntment of Roſes, Populeum of the Mucilages, of Yolks of Eggs, and Oyl of Roſes, and the like, to aſſwage the Pain and Inflammation.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when the Diſeaſe is violent, Narcoticks muſt be uſed inwardly and outwardly; Laudanum Opiatum is beſt, whereof three or four grains may be given with Maſtich, or ſealed Earth, or mixt with a Gliſter made of a Decoction of Camomil Flowers.</p>

                  <p>THe Worms are generated in various Parts of the Body, yet becauſe that is very ſeldom, and they moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently abound in the Guts, therefore we ſhall treat only of theſe.</p>
                  <p>The Signs of Worms in the Bowels are various, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are moſt frequent and ordinary, a ſtinking Breath, and Excrements like Cow-dung: There are other Signs, but they are not ſo common, as a continual Feaver, which has Exacerbations often in a Day, with a cold Sweat, Anxiety, and ſometimes with fainting, Nauſeouſneſs, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, and great Thirſt; the Pulſe are unequal, the Cheeks are red by turns, or wax livid, the Eyes ſhine, the Noſtrils itch, the Teeth gnaſh, there is a ſmall dry Cough, the Spittle is more than uſual, ſometimes the Head is heavy, there is a ſleepy Diſpoſition, ſometimes a Delirium and Convulſive Fits, there is moſt commonly a pain in the Belly, like a gnawing or Biting, ſometimes the Belly ſwells as in a Dropſie, ſometimes the Body waſtes beyond Meaſure, and ſometimes there is an inſatiable Appetite. The Worms called Aſcarides are known by a troubleſome itching about the Fundament, and they alſo often appear upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements: To conclude, Putrefaction of the Gums is alſo a Sign.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of Worms is to be directed to the Expulſion of them, by purging Medicines that kill them, and expel the Matter from whence they are generated.</p>
                  <p>

The ſame Remedies are good for the Cure which were preſcribed for Bleeding at the Noſe.</p>
                  <p>The Hemorrhoidal Veins ending in the Extremity of the right Gut and Fundament, are often ſwelled, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much Pain is often occaſioned.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, firſt Blood muſt be drawn from the Arm, that Revulſion may be made from the part affected, which being ſufficiently peformed, a Vein in the Foot muſt be opened for Derivation.</p>
                  <p>The Belly muſt be kept continually open, becauſe hard Excrements; and ſtraining to evacuate them, exaſperate the Pain; an Infuſion of Caſſia taken Morning and Eve is very good to looſen the Belly.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while various Topicks are to be applied to the Part, to aſſwage the Pain and Inflammation, and to diſcuſs the Tumour, Oyl of ſweet Almonds freſh drawn, applyed to the Part eaſes the Pain, and ſeveral Liniments and Oyntments may be preſcribed for the ſame Purpoſe, whereof ſome eaſe the Pain, others dicuſs and dry, and others heat the Ulcers; they are to be applyed with Lint or Cotton.</p>

                     <hi>Take one Yolk of an Egg, of Oyl of Roſes, or of Violets, as much as is ſufficient; make a Liniment, and if you add to it Populeum Oyntment, 'twill be more effectual to eaſe Pain, and when the Pain is very violent, a few grains of Opium may be added to it.</hi> Or,</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXXXII. Of a Dropſie.</head>
                  <p>EVery Age and Sex are ſometimes troubled with a Dropſie, yet Women are more inclined to it than Men, it comes upon Men chiefly when they are old, and upon Women when they have done breeding; but it ſometimes ſeiſes barren Women when they are young: The pitting of the lower part of the Leg by impreſſion of the Finger, is not ſo certain Sign of a Dropſie in Women as in Men; for Women that are with Child, and ſuch as have a ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of the Courſes, are often ſubject to the ſame; nor does ſuch a Swelling certainly indicate a Dropſie; for when an old Man of a groſs Habit of Body, having been a long while afflicted with an Aſthma, is ſuddenly freed from it in the Winter, preſently a great Swelling ſeiſes the Legs, yet notwithſtanding, generally ſpeaking, the Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Legs is to be accounted a Sign of an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dropſie.</p>
                  <p>Three Symptoms accompany this Diſeaſe, Difficulty of Breathing, little Urine, and great Thirſt.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſorts of Tumours of the Belly that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a Dropſie, that are common to Women; the firſt is, a preternatural Excreſcence of the Fleſh in the parts within the Belly, which makes the Belly as Bulky as when Water is included in it; the other kind ariſes from Wind, which does not only occaſion a Tumour, but alſo other Signs of Breeding; Widdows are moſt inclined to this ſort, or ſuch Women as were not married till they were in Years.</p>
                  <p>The true and genuine curative Indications are wholly to be directed, either to the Evacuation of the Water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Belly and other Parts, or to ſtrengthen the Blood.</p>
                  <p>That Purging may be inſtituted to the Advantage of the Patient, we ought to know whether the Sick is eaſily purged or hardly; which can be known no other Way than by Inquiry, how purging Remedies uſed at other times worked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:65404:136"/>A Dropſie, above all other Diſeaſes, requires the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and quickeſt Purges, and the Sick ought to be purged every day, unleſs by reaſon of the Weakneſs of the Body, or the too violent Operation of the preceding Purge, he ought to reſt a day or two; for you muſt not leave off pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, unleſs Neceſſity urge, till all the Water is quite car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off.</p>
                  <p>For thoſe that are eaſily purged, Syrup of Buck-thorn may be ſufficient to carry off the Water.</p>
                  <p>But when the Sick is of ſuch a Conſtitution, that gentle Catharticks will not work quickly nor eaſily, ſtronger muſt be given; for which I have frequently preſcribed the following Potion with Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Tamarinds half an ounce, of the Leaves of Senna two drams, of Rubarb one dram and an half, boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Fountain-water to three ounces; in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve of Manna, and Syrup of Roſes ſolutive, each one ounce; of Syrup of Buck-thorn half an ounce, of the Electuary of the Juice of Roſes two drams; mingle them, make a Potion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this Potion muſt be given only to ſtrong People; it purges when other things will not, as I have found by frequent experience. Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of White-wine four ounces, of Jalap finely powdered one dram, of Ginger powdered one Scruple, of Syrup of Buck-thorn one ounce; mingle them, make a Potion to to be taken early in the Morning, and to be repeated every Day, or every other Day, according to the Strength.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But two Medicines remain, which in my Opinion are better than all the reſt, for thoſe that are difficultly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I mean Elaterium, and the Infuſion of Crocus Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallorum, Elaterium, or the Fecula of wild Cucumbers, being given in a ſmall quantity, purge watery Humours powerfully, for two grains of it are a ſufficient Doſe for moſt People; I uſed to mix it with a ſcruple of the Pill ex duobus, and to make three ſmall Pills to be taken in the Morning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:65404:136"/>As to the Infuſion of Crocus Metallorum, an ounce and an half of it, or two ounces for thoſe that are difficultly vomited, given in a Morning, and repeated daily, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Strength of the Sick, though it may ſeem at firſt only to evacuate the Water contained in the Stomach, yet at length it will free the Belly from the Waters that are in it.</p>
                  <p>But if the foreſaid Vomit does not ſufficiently purge the Belly, for it uſes to purge at laſt, after the third or fourth Doſe of the Infuſion of Crocus Metallorum by it ſelf, I ſometimes though rarely, uſe the following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Water of Carduus Benedictus three ounces, of the Infuſion of Crocus Metallorum one ounce and an half, of Syrup of Buck-thorn half an ounce, of the Electuary of the Juice of Roſes two drams; mingle them, make a Potion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it is to be noted, that if the Swelling of the Belly be but ſmall, the Water is not ſo eaſily evacuated by the Infuſion of Crocus Metallorum, as when the Dropſie is great, and a great quantity of Water is heaped up; wherefore unleſs the Belly be much ſwelled, it is beſt to do all by things that purge downwards.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt take notice that it often happens, that Water is caſt not only upon the Thighs and Legs, but alſo into the Cavity of the Belly, and yet it is not to be evacuated by Purging Medicines. For Inſtance, When ſuch a Tumour follows a long Conſumption, or when it is occaſioned by the Putrefaction of ſome of the Bowels, or from the Tone of the Blood ſpoiled, and the Spirits ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, or by long continuance of Fiſtula's in Carnous Parts, or occaſioned by great Weakneſs and Evacuations by Sweating, Fluxing, or by violent purging, and by a thin Diet in the Cure of the French Pox, in theſe Caſes the Patient will be rendered worſe by purging; wherefore we muſt endeavour all we can to ſtrengthen the Blood and Bowels: And among Remedies to this purpoſe, which are to be mentioned by and by, I have found by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that the change of the Air, and Exerciſe in a free Air, ſuch as the Sick can bear, anſwers this Indication excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:65404:137"/>And when the Sick is of a weakly Conſtitution, or a Woman ſubject to Vapours, neither Purge nor Vomits muſt be uſed, but you muſt endeavour to evacuate the Water by Diureticks.</p>
                  <p>I order one pound of the Aſhes of Broom to be infuſed in the cold in three Pints of Rheniſh-wine, and that a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil or two of the Leaves of common Wormwood be added to it, let the Sick take four ounces of the Liquor filtrated daily in the Morning, at five in the Evening, and late at Night, till the Swelling goes off; with which Remedy alone I have known ſome Dropſies that were accounted deplorable cured, in ſuch whoſe weak Conſtitution could not bear Purging.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the ſecond Intention, half the Buſineſs is no more than done, when the Water is evacuated; wherefore we muſt endeavour to ſtrengthen the Blood by a long and daily Courſe of heating and ſtrengthening Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines to prevent a new Collection of Water, and to this end the Sick muſt drink Wine whilſt he is under Cure after the Paſſages are open for the Water to go out, or inſtead of Wine ſtrong Beer.</p>
                  <p>For poor People who could not provide better Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, I uſe to order Srong-beer, wherein Horſe-radiſh Root, the Leaves of common Wormwood, Garden Scurvy-graſs, Sage, the leſſer Centaury, and the Tops of Broom have been infuſed, for their ordinary Drink. Rich People may uſe Canary-wine, wherein the ſame bitter Herbs have been infuſed, whereof a ſmall draught may be taken twice or thrice a day, or they may take nine ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of Wormwood-wine inſtead of it, after two drams of the following Digeſtive Electuary in the Morning, at four in the Afternoon, and at Bed-time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Conſerve of Garden Scurvy-graſs one ounce and an half, of the Conſerve of Roman Wormwood, and of the yellow Rind of Oranges, each one ounce; of candied Angelica, and Nutmegs candied, each half an ounce, of Venice Treacle three drams, of the compound Powder of Wake-robin, two drams, with a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Oranges, make an Electuary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:65404:137"/>The Sick muſt be ſure to drink ſparingly of ſmall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; but to take off his Thirſt, he may often waſh his Mouth with cold Water ſharpened with Spirit of Vitriol, and he may hold Tamarinds in his Mouth now and then, or may chew a Lemon, but he muſt ſwallow neither of them.</p>
                  <p>But amongſt corroborating things, Steel is not the leaſt. Garlick is alſo very good; and without any Evacuatious I have known a Dropſie cured by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Syrup of Steel a quart; let a ſpoonful be taken with fifteen grains of Cream of Tartar, every Morning, in five ſpoonfuls of the following Julep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Aqua-lactis Alexiter. one Pint, of compound Water of Wormwood, and of compound Water of Gentian, each three ounces; mingle them, make a Julep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Steel prepared, with Sulphur of aſtringent Saffron of Mars, each half an ounce; of Crabs-eyes, and red Coral prepared, and of Salt of Wormwood, each one dram; of Volatile Salt of Amber one ſcruple, of Extract of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian a ſufficient quantity; mingle them, make ten Pills of every dram, let him take four every Night at Bed-time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis to be noted, that that Dropſie which only ſwells the the Legs or the Belly a little, does not preſently require to be cured by Vomiting, and Purging; for it's often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the heating and ſtrengthning Medicines above mentioned; but above all, 'tis to be minded, that when we undertake to cure this Diſeaſe by Corroboratives or Lixivial Medicines, the Patient muſt by no means be purged.</p>
                  <p>Topical or external Remedies, as far as I have obſerved do nothing conſiderable, and Bliſters often occaſion a Gangrene. To conclude, though this Diſeaſe, when it comes to a Dropſie of the Belly, has been always accounted deſperate, yet it will appear, that if it be treated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Method above deſcribed, it may be as certainly cured (if the Bowels are not corrupted) as many other Diſeaſes which are not reckoned ſo deadly.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXXXIV. Of an Anaſarca.</head>
                  <p>AN Anaſarca is a white ſoft Swelling of the outward parts of the Body, or of ſome of them, it yields to the Touch, and will pit, and is occaſioned by watry Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours extravaſated.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, there are two things chiefly to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Firſt, That the Water within the Skin ſhould be evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Secondly, That Care be taken to prevent the heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of new Water, to which End we muſt endeavour (the Viſcera of Concoction being freed from Obſtructions and Filth) that good Chyle be made and carried in a due quantity to the Maſs of Blood, and that it be ſufficiently fermented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:65404:140"/>The Vital Indication is of little uſe in this Diſeaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſeldom Fainting or Watching for which Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials and Hypnoticks are required, and alſo a ſtrengthning diet; for Faſting and Abſtinence do good in this Caſe, and often perform the greateſt part of the Cure; for the Veſſels being emptied by Faſting, abſorb the Waters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Skin or ſtagnating elſewhere, and evacuate them by the Reins or the Pores of the Skin, or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>The Sick muſt uſe purging Medicines preſcrib'd for a Dropſie, and the ſame Diureticks.</p>
                  <p>A Decoction of the Woods is alſo very proper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Shavings of Guajacum ſix ounces, of Saſſafras two ounces, of all the Sanders each ſix drams, of Ivory and Hartshorn raſped each three drams; infuſe them, and boil them in four quarts of Fountain-water till half is conſumed, adding to it the Roots of Sweet-ſmelling Flag, of the leſſer Galingal, of Burdock, and Butter-bur, each one ounce; of the Leaves of Sharp-ſage, and of dried Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, each two handfuls; keep the ſtrained Liquor for uſe; the Doſe is eight or ten ounces hot twice a Day, to every Doſe add twenty or five and twenty drops of Spirit of Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>armoniack, with Amber, or of Soot, or of the Tincture of Salt of Tartar half a dram, or a dram.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Frictions do often good in an Anaſarca, wherefore the whole Body may be rubb'd once or twice a day with a courſe Napkin, or with Bruſhes made for that Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Bliſters evacuate the Water plentifully, but there is Danger of a Gangrene by the uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>But Eſcharoticks may be more ſafely uſed than Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; an Emperick often evacuated ſucceſsfully Water from the Members of Dropſical People, if they were never ſo much ſwelled, in the following manner by an Eſcharotick, <hi>viz</hi> Firſt, he fomented their Legs Morning and Evening with a Decoction of Dwarf-elder, Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Camomil, and other hot Herbs, the grounds of Beer or Wine being added to it; and betwixt the times of Bathing he applied a Cataplaſm made of the Dregs of the Decoction and Bran; after theſe things had been uſed three days, he covered the Legs and Feet with a Plaiſter
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65404:140"/>
made of Burgundine-pitch, leaving only upon each Calf a little hole about the bigneſs of a ſmall Nut, in which places he applied an Eſcarotick Medicine to the naked Skin, made of the Aſhes of the Bark of the Aſh, which being taken off, after twelve hours, a ſmall Eſchar remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the pores whereof the Water firſt drained gently and daily; afterwards it dropt more freely, but when the Eſchar caſt, it flowed as from a Fountain, till it had emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied the Legs.</p>
                  <p>Another Way remains (as good as the former but leſs us'd) to drain the Water, <hi>viz.</hi> By pricking with a Needle, which alſo muſt be uſed cautiouſly and leiſurely, leſt the Flux of Waters ſhould be too great; provide ſuch a Needle as Tailors uſe, and prick the Place that is moſt ſwelled with it ſo as that the Blood may not come; you muſt prick only ſix or ſeven Holes at at a time, at the Diſtance of the Breadth of a Thumb, one from the other; the Water will break out drop by drop from each Hole continually, till all the Swelling about the Parts prick'd diſappears; and then the next time, ſometimes after twelve hours, ſometimes after eighteen, and ſometimes after twenty four, prick again in another part of the ſame Leg, or in the other; and ſo once or twice a day in this or that Member, in one or two or more at a time, for the Water may be drawn more plentifully and ſafer this Way than any other; and if the Breeding of new Water be prevented by Medicines, the Diſeaſe will be eaſily cured. Moreover, in a deplorable Dropſie the Life may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed this way: An old Man of Seventy Years of Age, that was dropſical all over, kept his Head above Water, and lived many Months by this means, contrary to Expectation.</p>
                  <p>But to ſtrengthen and reſtore the Blood, the following Medicines muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Conſerve of Sea-wormwood, of Scurvy-graſs, and the yellow Peel of Oranges, each two ounces; of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran-Bark two drams, of the Species Diacurcuma one dram and an half, of Steel prepared with Sulphur three drams, of Salt of Wormwood two drams, of Syrup of the Bark of Curon a ſufficient quantity, make an Electuary; the Doſe is two drams in the Morning, and at five in the Afternoon.</hi>

                  <p>

                  <p>IN the old Treatiſes of Phyſick, there is ſo ſeldom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the Scurvy, and the Deſcription of it is ſo ſmall, that ſome have doubted whether ſuch a Diſeaſe (that is now Endimial in many Places, and Sporadick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every where, and wherewith almoſt every one is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or thinks he is ſo) did at all exiſt in ancient Times; and ſome think its Riſe is of a newer date, as are the French-pox and Rickets; but this Diſeaſe, though it had other Names, was obſerved by the Ancients, and the Cure of it was deſcribed by them, though not very exactly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:65404:141"/>Many and various are the Symptoms of the Scurvy, and ſometimes ſuch as are of a contrary Nature, are imputed to it; and if any unuſual Accident happens to the Body, that cannot be referred to any other certain kind of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, we preſently pronounce it Scorbutick. And ſo this notorious Diſeaſe bears the Blame of all, but many truly belong to it which ariſe in almoſt every part of the Body, and therefore we will trace it from Head to Foot; it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions violent, habitual, wandering or periodick Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achs, ſometimes a Dulneſs of the Spirits, and Drowſineſs, ſometimes Watchings, Giddineſs, Convulſions, Palſie, much Spitting, Ulcers of the Gums, Looſneſs of the Teeth, and a Stinking of the Breath. About the Region of the Breaſt, Pains in various parts of the Membranes, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially on the Breaſt-bone, which are often very violent for many Nights and Days; an Aſthma, difficult and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Breathing, Conſtriction and Narrowneſs of the Breaſt, a dry Cough, an inordinate Pulſe, trembling of the Heart, frequent Fainting, and almoſt a continual Fear of it. This Diſeaſe makes the lower Belly its principal Seat, and occaſions many Diſorders there, as Nauſeouſneſs, Vomiting, Wind, a Cardialgia, frequent Collicks, and troubleſome Pains running hither and thither, a Looſneſs that is almoſt continual, ſometimes a Bloody-flux, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and a Dropſie.</p>
                  <p>The Urine is often red, with a Cruſt upon it, or ſticking to the Sides of the Pot, and ſometimes 'tis pale and rendred in a great quantity; in the outward Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and over the whole Body, there are Wandring pains, and oftentimes ſuch as are violent, eſpecially in the Night; alſo Spontaneous Laſſitude, a Waſting of the Fleſh, a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Limbs, Spots of various colours upon the Skin, Tumours, Tubercles, and ill Ulcers, Numbneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the Muſcels, Twitching of the Tendons, Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Feavers, and great Hemorrhagies.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the common and uſual Symptoms of the Scurvy, whereof ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this kind, ſometimes that kind afflict the Sick, and ſometimes unuſual and prodgious Accidents happen.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, Becauſe it is not one ſimple preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſorder, but a Legion is to be combated with; therefore the Method of Cure conſiſts of many Indications,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65404:142"/>
that are variouſly complicated, but yet they may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to theſe three Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> They muſt be preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to reſpect the Cauſe of the Diſeaſes, and curative, that reſpect the Diſeaſe it ſelf and its Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, Vital, which reſtore and defend the Strength of the Patient.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Sick muſt be purged, and if there be a weight upon the Stomach, a Vomit muſt be given; and if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be ſtrong and luſty, and uſed to bear Vomiting well, the Vinum-benedictum may be given, and the like.</p>
                  <p>But if the Sick be of a weakly Conſtitution; you muſt give Wine of Squills, or Gilla Theophraſti, and the Sick muſt fill his Stomach with Poſſet-drink, and force it up with his Finger, or with a Feather.</p>
                  <p>As to Purging, If the Sick be of a hot Conſtitution; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines of Aloes and Diagridium muſt be avoided, and ſuch as are made of Senna and Rubarb, muſt be given, As,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leavss of Senna one ounce, of Rubarb ſix drams, of Dodder of Thym three drams, of the Roots of Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pody of the Oak, and of Engliſh Rubarb dried, each half an ounce; of yellow Sanders two drams, of Celtick Spike half a dram, of Salt of Wormwood two drams; cut them and bruiſe them, and infuſe them in a Matraſs, in the Heat of Sand, with Whitewine and Fumitory-water, each a Pint for two days; evaporate the clear Liquor ſtrained in the gentle heat of a Bath to the Conſiſtence of Hony, then add of the Powder of the Leaves of Senna, and of Rubarb, each one dram and an half; of the Species of the three Sanders one dram, of Cream of Tartar one dram and an half; make a Maſs for Pills. The Doſe is from half a dram to a dram, to be taken once a Week, or oftner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or let the Infuſion be evaporated to the Conſiſtence of a Syrup, adding towards the end, of Manna ſtrained and of White Sugar, each two ounces; make a Syrup. The Doſe is one or two Spoonfuls in a proper Vehicle.</p>
                  <p>They who are of a cold Conſtitution may take the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Pills.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Stomach-pill with Gums two drams, of Roſin, of Jalap, grains twenty; of Tartar vitriolated grains ſixteen, of Oyl of Juniper ten drops, with a ſufficient
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65404:142"/>
quantity of Ammoniacum diſſolved in the Water of Worms; make ſixteen Pills, let four be taken once a Week.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>After Purging once or twice, if Bleeding be indicated, you muſt bleed in the Arm, or with Leeches.</p>
                  <p>After Bleeding many Remedies of another kind are neceſſary; but that you may preſcribe orderly, you muſt conſider whether the Preſervatory Indications have only place here, or whether ſome curatory Indications, namely ſuch as reſpect the Symptoms that are violent ought not to be minded between whiles. But if there be no urgent Symptom, you muſt wholly apply your ſelf to the Cure according to the following Method. And as to the Cure of the Symptoms, we ſhall treat of them by themſelves below.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, If your chief Deſign be to erradicate the Cauſe of the Scurvy, digeſtive, and Specifick or Antiſcorbutick Remedies muſt be uſed at all times, except on the Days the Sick purges, whereunto, if there be Occaſion, Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks or Diureticks muſt be ſometimes added. Various Forms are preſcribed by Authors every where to anſwer theſe Intenſions, but we will only mention the chiefeſt, which according to the twofold Diſpoſition of the ſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Sulphurous Saline, and the Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no ſulphurean Diſcraſſy of the Blood, we will diſtinguiſh, into two Claſſes; And Firſt, Of the cold Scurvy.</p>
                  <p>Among Digeſtive Medicines, Cream of Tartar, Salt and Tincture of it, Tartar vitriolated, Elixir Proprietatis, or either of theſe, may be taken twice a day. Or,</p>

Water, and thoſe that are impregnated with the Infuſion of Baulm, Borrage, and Burnet, may be allowed. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Wines may be prepared of the Juice of Currants, of Cherries and of Garden-fruits, which may be ripened by Fermentation, and are very grateful to the Stomach, and purifie the Blood: Syder is alſo very good, if it be clear, and not ſharp. Moreover, many ingredients may be put into clear Syder, as the Tops of Pine or of Fir, the Flowers of Tamariſck, the Raſpings of Ivory or Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, which ſweeten and preſerve the Liquor.</p>

Provide ſix Gallons of Small Ale, and inſtead of Hops, boil the Tops of Pine or Tamariſck in it, or the Raſpings of the Wood of either of them; and when it has done working; put into a Bag ſharp-pointed Dock dried, which is an excellent Medicine for the Scurvy; alſo the Leaves of Water-creſſes, or Brook-lime, and Bank-creſſes; alſo Citrons, or Oranges cut in Slices, and hanged in Veſſels.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have treated about the Removal of the Morbiſick cauſe, but when the Symptoms are very violent, they require a peculiar Method of Cure.

                        <hi>Tunbridge-waters</hi> and the like are of excellent uſe in this caſe. Chalybeat Medicines are alſo very good, but Crocus Martis is the beſt. I have uſed the following Method often with very good Succeſs. Firſt, The Sick muſt be purged with the Powder or Infuſion of Rubarb, with ſome aſtringent Aromaticks added to it; and it muſt be repeated three or four days after. On the days the Sick does not purge, he muſt take Morning and Evening the quantity of a Nutmeg of the following Electuary.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But he conſtantly drank a medicated Beer made of the Roots of Sharp-pointed Docks, and of the Leaves of Brook-lime.</p>
                     <p>A Vertigo often comes upon an inveterate Scurvy; as alſo frequent Swoonings, and Numbneſs in the Limbs; they are very difficultly cured, by reaſon they are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a Scorbutick Salt obſtructing the Brain and Nerves.

                        <hi>Take of the Tops of Madder, Cypreſs, of the Leaves of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, Ladies-ſmock, each one handful; boil them in three pints of Water wherein hot Iron hath been quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,

to the Conſumption of a third part; add to the ſtrained Liquor two ounces of Honey of Roſes; mingle them.</hi>

                     <p>When the Gums are putrified and corrupted, and the Teeth being carious and looſe, ſtink, ſtronger Medicines, and ſuch as greatly reſiſt Putrefaction, are to be uſed.</p>
                     <p>The Infuſion of Vitriol camphorated, and of Lapis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamentoſus, is very effectual in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>If deep and putrid Ulcers afflict the Gums, or any other part of the Mouth, ſtrong Remedies muſt be often uſed; alſo Cotton dipt in Aegyptiacum diſſoloved in Spirit, or in the Infuſion of Lapis Medicamentoſus, or ſublimate, muſt be ſometimes applied to the part affected.</p>
                     <p>Scorbutick People are alſo oftentimes afflicted with Pains in the Legs and in other Joints, eſpecially in the Night-time, for the removing of which Pains, which are ſometimes very violent, beſides the general Method of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Scurvy, Specifick Remedies are to be uſed: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch a caſe Purging having been rightly performed, and Bleeding, if there be occaſion for it, Medicines both external and internal muſt be uſed.</p>
                     <p>As to the Firſt, Thoſe that evacuate by Sweat, and by Urine, are oft-times very effectual: Teſtaceous Powders, Crabs-eyes, the Jaw of a Pike, the Spirit, and Flowers of Sal-Armoniack, Spirit of Blood, Tincture of Antimony, and of Coral, Decoctions of the Roots and Seeds of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, Ground-pine, and Germander, are very proper; and ſuch like Remedies may be taken twice or thrice a day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Certainly the Magiſterial-water, of Worms, of the <hi>London</hi> Diſpenſatory, is very beneficial in this Diſeaſe, ſo are the Spirit and Salt of Harts-horn, Spirit of Blood, Flowers of Sal-armoniack, which I have often uſed with good Succeſs.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Teſtaceous Powders, as Crabs-eyes, Coral, Pearls, and Vegetables, which are counted good for the Gout, as the Roots of Birth-wort, the Leaves of Ground-pine, and Germander, and the like, mixed with Antiſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buticks conduce to the Cure of this Diſeaſe. Oyl of Worms, of Frogs and Toads, are often uſeful to eaſe the Pain. I have been told by a worthy Man, that the Water drawn from what is contained in the Stomach of an Ox newly killed, by Diſtillation, and applied hot with Cloaths, gives certainly eaſe.</p>
                     <p>For Convulſive and Paralitick Diſeaſes occaſioned by the Scurvy, Remedies proper for them muſt be mixed with Antiſcorbuticks,</p>
                     <p>For a Conſumption and a Feaver ocaſioned by the Scurvy, gentle Catharticks, Digeſtives, and things that corroborate muſt be uſed. And becauſe they often ariſe from a ſcirrhous Tumour in the Stomach, or Parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, things that open Obſtructions are to be uſed, as <hi>Tunbridge-waters,</hi> and the like. Moreover, Fomentations, Liniments and Plaiſters muſt be outwardly applyed; Aſſes or Cows-milk, diluted with Barly-water, or with ſome proper diſtilled-water is often good; ſo is Broth made of Snails, and Snails boiled in Milk. Moreover, Diſtilled waters of Milk or Whey with Snails, and Antiſcorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Herbs, do a great deal of Good in this Caſe. And for the Feaver, the following Medicines may be uſed with a thin Diet,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Raſpings of Harts-horn, and Ivory, each two drams and an half; of Eryngo Roots candied ſix drams, of the Roots of Chervil, Dandelyon, each half an ounce; of the Leaves of Harts-tongue, Liverwort, each one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; one Apple ſliced, of Raiſins one handful; boil them in four Pints of Fountain-water to the Conſumption of a

                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Leaves of Brook-lime four handfuls, of Wood-ſorrel, of the Herb and Root of Dandelyon, each two handfuls; of Snails cleanſed one pound and an half, the Peels of two Oranges: After they are bruiſed and cut, pour upon them ſix Pints of new Milk, or Whey made with Syder, or of the freſh Juice of Apples; diſtill them after the common Way. Three ounces may be taken twice or thrice a day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Scorbutical Rhumatiſm muſt be cured by Purging, but eſpecially by Bleeding, and repeated ſometimes according to the Strength of the Patient.</p>
                     <p>Diureticks and Diaphoreticks muſt be alſo uſed, and four or ſix ounces of the Infuſion of Horſe-dung in Wine or Ale may be taken twice or thrice a day on the Days the Sick does not purge. Spirit of Harts-horn, or of Blood, is alſo very good in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>A Scorbutical Dropſie ariſing from an evident Cauſe, or occaſionally, is often cured; wherefore, if the Sick cannot ſleep, Opiats muſt be given, and Purging muſt be repeated at due diſtances, according to the Strength of the Patient, and Gliſters muſt be often injected to keep the Body looſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of Mercurius Dulcis one Scruple, of Roſin of Jalap five or ten grains, of Cloves half a Scruple; mix them and give it in a ſpoonful of Panado: At other Times Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and ſometimes Diaphoreticks, muſt be given.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of Mille pedes prepared three drams, of Salt of Tartar two drams, of Nutmegs one dram; mix them, make a Powder. The Doſe is half a dram twice a day with ſome proper Liquor.</hi> Or,</p>

The Doſe is one ſcruple or half a dram to be taken twice a day, drinking upon it three or four ounces of the following Water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Leaves of both the Scurvy-graſſes, of Water-creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of Pepper-wort, and Arſmart, each three handfuls; of the Roots of Wake-robin, Briony, and Florentine-orris, each four ounces; of the middle Bark of Elder two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, of the Winteran-bark two ounces, of the yellow Peel of four Oranges, and three Lemmons, and of freſh Juniper-berries, four ounces; cut them and bruiſe them, and pour upon them two quarts of Rheniſh-wine, and of the Wine made of the Juice of Elder-berries one quart. Diſtill them in a common Still, and mix the Waters. The Doſe is three or four ounces twice a day, after a Doſe of any of the Medicines above preſcribed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There remains one Symptom, that comes, though rarely, upon the Scurvy, <hi>viz.</hi> A crackling of the Bones; but the Cure of it is not yet known.</p>
                     <p>An orderly Diet is of great moment in the Cure of the Scurvy: The Sick muſt only eat Meat of eaſy Digeſtion, he muſt avoid thick and clammy Meat, and ſuch as are ſmoaked, and Pulſe, Milk-meats, unripe Fruit, and things that are ſugared; for the Scurvy has increaſed wonderfully of late by the immoderate uſe of Sugar.</p>
                     <p>Their Drink muſt be middling mild Beer, that is clear and medicated with Antiſcorbuticks.</p>
                     <p>Exerciſe and Labour are ſo beneficial in the Scurvy, that many have been cured by them alone. An Air mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately hot and dry, thin and pure, ſhould be choſen.</p>

                  <p>THE Nephritick Pain is called that whick afflicts the Reins and Ureters: The cauſe of this Pain is various; but the moſt frequent is a Stone or groſs Flegm.</p>
                  <p>The leſs frequent cauſes are Clods of Blood thruſt into the Ureters, or thick Matter, conveyed from the Reins or other Parts into the Ureters.</p>
                  <p>The diagnoſtick Signs of the Stone.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Sign is a fixed Pain about the Region of the Loins; the ſecond is bloody Urine; the third thin and little Water at the Beginning of the Fit, which is ſometimes ſucceeded by a total Suppreſſion of Urine, if both the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be obſtructed; the fourth is, the frequent voiding of Sand and little Stones; the fifth is, a Numbneſs of the Legs; the Sixth is, the drawing up of the Stones; the ſeventh is, Nauſeouſneſs and Vomiting.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of the Nephritick Pain, and Stone ſticking in the Reins and Ureters, is peformed by dilating the Paſſages, by the Exploſion of the Stone, or any other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which cauſes Pain; and alſo by removing the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Cauſe, and mitigating the Pain, to the which Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations the following Remedies anſwer.</p>

                  <p>After the Gliſter hath done Working, a Vein may be opened in the Arm.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXXXVII. Of the Stone in the Bladder.</head>
                  <p>IT is very difficult to know this Diſeaſe, eſpecially at the beginning, when the Stone is ſmall; but when it is great it is eaſily known.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Sign is, a pain in the Neck of the Bladder, which is exaſperated about the end of making Water, and ſtretches it ſelf to the Glans; it is very like a Heat of Urine, and can ſcarce be diſtinguiſhed from it at firſt, till other Signs begin to appear.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Sign is, an itching on the Yard, which forces the Sick to handle and ſcratch it often.</p>
                  <p>The Third Sign is, a Weight in the Peritonaeum, and in all the Region of the Pubis, with a heavy Pain; this is when the Stone is large.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Sign, when the Stone is large, there is a great Difficulty in making Water; the Sick endeavours to make Water often, but renders it by drops.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Sign is, a Suppreſſion of Urine in making Water, when it ſtops ſuddenly in the middle Courſe, the Stone being brought with the Urine to the Neck of the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Sign is, the voiding Urine moſt eaſily upon lying on the Back, becauſe the Stone in that Poſition goes fartheſt from the Channel of the Bladder; alſo when the Urine, being ſuppreſſed in making Water, flows freely;
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65404:150"/>
when the Body is laid back and ſhook, the Stone falling then to the bottom of the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh Sign is, frequent Erection of the Penis, which prooceeds from a retention of the Urine, and from an Inflammation of the Bladder occaſioned by the rubbing of the Stone.</p>
                  <p>The eighth Sign is, a Teneſmus, and a frequent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to go to Stool, which follows the Endeavours of making Water, by reaſon of the conſent betwixt the Sphincter of the Anus, and the Bladder; and the one being irritated, the other is ſo too, becauſe they receive Branches from the ſame Nerve.</p>
                  <p>The ninth Sign is, that the Sick cannot reſt in one place, they move their Legs alternately; and if the Stone be large, he can ſcarce ſtand upright, or ride or walk in ſtony places.</p>
                  <p>The tenth Sign is, that the Sick are eaſed by no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but moſt commonly grow worſe thereby, becauſe all Medicines that come to the Urinary Paſſages increaſe the Diſeaſe, either by bringing new matter to the Bladder, or they rub off the Flegm which encompaſſeth the Stone, and then it grates harder upon the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>The eleventh Sign is, that when the Sick has been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Nephritick Pains, and uſed to void Gravel at the end of the Fit.</p>
                  <p>If after ſuch Pain he has not voided a Stone as he was wont, it is a Sign that the Stone remains in the Bladder, and increaſes by degrees, and occaſions the foreſaid Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is much the ſame with that deſcribed in the foregoing Chapter; when the Stone is ſmall, Water diſtil'd from Onyons being uſed for forty days, has evacuated a Stone of the bigneſs of a Bean: But daily Experience ſhews, that a Stone cannot be diſſolved in the Bladder by any Medicines; wherefore we are generally forced to leave ſuch Patients to the Lithotomiſt; and having been inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with one of the chiefeſt Lithotomiſts in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and made ſome Obſervations upon his Practice; I find that Children bear cutting well, and generally recover; but that Men paſt forty Years of Age, moſt commonly die.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. LXXXVIII. Of an Inflammation of the Reins and Bladder.</head>
                  <p>BEcauſe an Inflammation of the Reins and Bladder is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the ſame Remedies; therefore we include them both in one Chapter,</p>
                  <p>The Signs of an Inflammation of the Reins are, a heavy Pain in the Region of the Reins, and there is ſometimes a pulſation: If the place wherein the Arteries are be affected, and the Pain is extended to the neighbouring Parts, ſo that the Sick cannot raiſe himſelf upright nor ſtand, and but difficultly turn himſelf to the oppoſite ſide, neither can he lie upon that ſide nor upon his Belly, and therefore he is forced perpetually to lie upon his Back; if his Knees, or if his Body be any way moved, the Pain is much exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; there is a Numbneſs of the ſame ſide, by reaſon of a Nerve which goes from thence to the Leg; his Urine is hot, and in the beginning thin and yellow; afterwards red and thick. The Sick has a continual and acute Feaver, and it is often accompanied with watchings, a Delirium, Nauſeouſneſs and Vomiting.</p>
                  <p>But in an Inflammation of the Bladder, the Pain is ſeated upon the Region of the Pubis, and Perinaeum, in which Parts there is a Heat, and ſometimes an apparent Redneſs, the Urine is always hot, and voided difficultly, the Paſſage being ſtopt by the Tumour; and the right Gut is affected by reaſon of its Nearneſs; upon which account
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65404:151"/>
there is frequent endeavours to go to ſtool, and ſometimes the Belly is bound: There are alſo other Symptoms that are common with the Inflammation of the Reins, as a Feaver, watching, and the like.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of an Inflammation in the Reins and Bladder, is performed by Medicines that cauſe Revulſion and Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and by ſuch as cool and moderately repel, by Anodyn, reſolving and ſuppurating Medicines.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, Bleeding is very neceſſary twice, thrice, or oftener, acccording to the Strength, until the Fluxion is ſtopped and the Pain abated. A large quantity of Blood being taken away from the upper Veins, the lower are to be opened alſo in the Foot to make Derivation. The Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoidal Veins are alſo to be opened, eſpecially if they are ſwelled; and Cupping-glaſſes with Scarification are to be applied to the upper and lower parts to make Revulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Frictions and painful Ligatures of the extream parts are alſo to be uſed; Emollient cooling, and moderately looſning Gliſters muſt be injected in a ſmall quantity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſh-mallows one ounce, of the Leaves of Mallows, Violets, and Lettice, each one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; of ſweet Prunes four pair, of Barley cleanſed, and of the Flowers of Violets, each one Pugil; make a Decoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to eight or ten ounces; in the ſtrained Liquor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve one ounce of Caſſia, of Oyl of Violets four ounces, of Yolks of Eggs number two, make a Gliſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Heat of the Blood muſt be mitigated by Juleps and Emulſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Endive, Lettice and Purſlain, each four ounces; of Syrup of Pomegranates two ounces, of Syrup of Water-lillies one ounce; mingle them, make a Julep, for three Doſes to be taken Morning or Evening.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Sorrel two ounces, of the Leaves of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Plantane, Purſlain, and Endive, each one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; of the Tops of white Poppies half an handful, of the Seeds of Anniſe and Lettice, each one dram; of the Flowers of Borrage, Violets, and Water-lillies, each one pugil; boil them to a Pint and an half; then add of the Syrup of Pomegranates four ounces.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of ſweet Almonds blanced one ounce, of freſh Pine-nuts half an ounce, of the Seeds of Lettice, Sorrel, Purſlain, and white Poppies, each three drams; beat them in a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65404:152"/>
marble Mortar, and pour upon them of the Waters of Barley, or Lettice, or Purſlain one Pint and an half; in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve one ounce of Sugar of Roſes; make an Emulſion for three Doſes. Syrup of Poppies may be conveniently added to this Emulſion, to reſtrain the Fluxion more powerfully.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cooling Gliſters muſt be alſo injected.</p>
                  <p>In the Beginning of theſe Inflammations, Purging is not convenient, but at the Declination gentle Purges may be uſed, as of Manna, Caſſia, Rubarb, Tamarinds and the like.</p>
                  <p>But cooling and moderately repelling Medicines muſt be uſed outwardly at the beginning, as liquid Epithems made of the Waters or Juices of Plantane, Sorrel, Endive, Night-ſhade, and of Roſes, with a little Vinegar, red San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Camphor; alſo Liniments of Oyl of Roſes Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phacine, and of Violets, the white Oyntment, or Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon alone, or mixed, a little Vinegar being added to them, may be applied almoſt cold to the Parts every hour.</p>
                  <p>If the Pain be very violent, it will not be improper to add to the Epithem or Liniment, a little Opium or Saffron.</p>
                  <p>A Cataplaſm may be alſo made of Barley-meal, with the Juice of Endive, Purſlain, and Night-ſhade, Oyl of Roſes being added to it and Populeum Oyntment; but it muſt be frequently changed before it grows hot.</p>
                  <p>But here three things are to be obſerved: Firſt, We muſt not continue too long the uſe of cooling Medicines; leaſt the Expulſion of the conjunct matter by Sweat ſhould be hindred, and the Tumours ſhould grow Scirrhous. Secondly, in an Inflammation of the Bladder, things that are but a little cooling and aſtringent muſt be uſed, leaſt a Suppreſſion of Urine ſhould happen, which is a Symptom that is very frequent of it ſelf in this Diſeaſe. Thirdly, Cataplaſms are not ſo proper in an Inflammation of the Bladder, as Liniments and Oyntments, becauſe they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the part with their Weight.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore when cooling Medicines have been uſed a very little while, and after Bleeding repeated, the Fluxion being pretty well ſtopt, we muſt uſe Emollients, and gentle Reſolvents, as Fomentations made of a Decoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Roots of Marſh-mallows, of the Leaves of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Violets, Pellitory, of the Seeds of Flax, Fenugreek,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65404:152"/>
Mallows, and of Cotton, of the Flowers of Camomil, Melilot, Roſemary, and Roſes; and Liniments are to be applied of Oyl of Lillies, Roſes, and with a little Oyl of Camomile,</p>
                  <p>The following Pultis is very ſoftning, and Anodyne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Crums of white Bread one pound; boil them in Goats-milk to the Conſiſtence of a Pultiſs; then add the Yolks of three Eggs, of Oyl of Roſes four ounces, of Saffron half a dram; make a Cataplaſm; it muſt be often changed; a little Opium and Camphor may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it if the Pain be very violent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there be danger of a Gangrene, a corroborating Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm muſt be made of the Meal of Beans, Orobus, and of Lupins boiled in Wine.</p>
                  <p>But when the Inflammation is in a manner taken off, then reſolving Decoction and Liniments muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>In the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe, reſpect muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had to the Feaver, Pain, Watchings, Suppreſſions of Urine, and the like.</p>
                  <p>And to eaſe the Pain of the Bladder, Anodyne Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories, or Yolks of Eggs, with a little Opium, and with the Juice of Henbane, or the like, muſt be tied up in a rag, and put up the Fundament.</p>
                  <p>If the Inflammation of the Reins cannot be diſcuſſed, but tends to Suppuration, which may be known by the Increaſe of the Feaver, of the Pain, and of other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; alſo by ſhaking and Vomiting, and by a greater Weight about the Part, eſpecially when the Sick bends to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the well Side; the Motion of Nature muſt be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by applying Cataplaſms made of emollient Roots, and Herbs, of the Seeds of Flax, and of the Flowers of Camomil, to which being boiled, bruiſed, and pulped, Meals, Butter, Greaſe, and proper Oyls muſt be added, whereby, unleſs the Abſceſs break and cleanſe it ſelf by Urine, the Matter breaks into the Cavity of the Belly; upon which account ſudden Death, or an hectick Feaver follows. Sometimes the Tumour ſwells outwards, and then it muſt be opened by a Potential Cautery, or with a Knife.</p>
                  <p>It alſo happens ſometimes, that the Tumours become Scirrhous, the Feaver ceaſing, but the Pain continuing with a greater Senſe of Weight, and a Numbneſs of the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65404:153"/>
neighbouring Parts, which are moſt commonly incurable, for the Sick falls into a Cachexy and Dropſie; yet the Cure may be attempted by emollient, inciding, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive Medicines.</p>

                  <p>BLood may be conveyed from many Parts to the Urinal Paſſages, and be mixed with the Urine, and ſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it bloody; but that rarely happens, and we only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe here of Diſeaſes of the Reins and Bladder, and of that bloody Urine which proceeds from the fault of thoſe Parts: The Blood flows from the Reins and Bladder, as from all other Parts, either by opening of the Veſſells, by a Rupture, or a Solution of the Continuum, but very rarely, by reaſon of the Thinneſs of the Veins which carry Blood to theſe Places.</p>
                  <p>The moſt frequent cauſes, are Fullneſs and Acrimony of the Blood, and a Stone in the Kidneys, a Fall or Blow, the lifting or carrying of a great Weight, violent Motion of the Body, or the like.</p>
                  <p>When Blood flows from the Bladder it is little in quantity.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe muſt be varied according to the Variety of the Cauſes: And firſt, If it proceed from a great quantity or Acrimony of the Blood, Bleeding muſt be uſed frequently, but little muſt be taken away at a time; and in this caſe Cupping glaſſes, Frictions, and Ligatures muſt be uſed to the upper Parts, and Derivation muſt be made by bleeding in the Foot, or by opening the Hemorrhoidal Veins.</p>
                  <p>When ſerous and Cholerick Humours promote this Evacuation, they muſt be purged off by Catharticks uſed by Intervals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Rubarb a little torrified and powdered one dram, of Coral prepared half a Scruple, of the Whey of Goats-milk, or of Plantane-water, three ounces; make a Potion.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Take of Caſſia freſh drawn half an ounce, of the Pulp of Tamarinds ſix drams, of Bole-armonick half a Scruple; with Sugar make a Bolus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After due Revulſions and Evacuations, or whilſt they are uſed, if there be occaſion, ſuch things as reſtrain the Blood, and heal the Veins muſt be given; but they muſt not be preſently uſed, leaſt the Blood ſhould be ſtopt too ſoon, and being thickned, it ſhould coagulate ſomewhere; for this Purpoſe the Juice of Plantane freſh drawn is much commended, four or five ounces of it being taken Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Evening, which is alſo very proper in all Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhagies, but if it be too cold for the Stomach, it may be boiled a little with Sugar.</p>
                  <p>Sheeps-milk is alſo much commended, four ounces of it being taken with a dram of Bole-armenick, but after takeing it, the Sick muſt not ſleep nor exerciſe himſelf. Decoctions alſo of Knot-graſs, Horſe-tail, Purſlain, and of the Tops of Brambles, ſweetned with Syrup of Quinces; or to qualifie the Heat of the Blood, the following Apozem may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves of Lettice, Purſlain, Plantane, and Comfrey, each one handful; of the four greater and leſſer cold Seeds, each one dram; of Jujubes three pair, of Liquoriſh half an ounce, of the Flowers of Water-lillies, of Violets, and of Roſes, each one Pugil; make a Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a Pint and an half; in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve of Gum-tragacanth a dram and an half; of Syrup of Violets, and of dried Roſes, each one ounce and an half; of Sal-prunella half an ounce, of the Troches of Alkakengi without Opium half a dram; make an Apozem for four Doſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To thicken and reſtrain the Blood more powerfully, we may add to it an ounce of Syrup of Poppies.</p>
                  <p>If the Diſeaſe be laſting, an Electuary may be made in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Conſerves of Roſes, and of the Roots of Comfrey each two ounces; of ſealed Earth, and Bole-Armenick, of Dragons-blood, red Coral, Blood-ſtone, and Troches of Ambar, each one dram; of Hypociſtis, grains of Kermes, and of the Seeds of Plantane, each one ſcruple; with equal Parts of Syrup of Mirtles, and of Poppies, make an Electuary, whereof let him take the quantity of a Walnut

                  <p>
                     <hi>Dr. Gordon</hi>'s Troches are alſo reckoned excellent in this Caſe.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe Clots of Blood are wont to be retained in the Bladder, and to occaſion violent Symptoms, for the Diſſolution of them, it will be convenient to drink warm now and then Mallow-water, mixed with a little Vinegar, but the quantity of the Vinegar muſt be ſo ſmall, that it can ſcarce be taſted.</p>
                  <p>Outwardly Topicks muſt be applied to the Region of the Loins, ſuch as are proper to cool and bind the Reins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Briſtort, and of Comfrey, each one ounce; of the Leaves of Plantane, Purſlain, Shepherds-purſe, Knot-graſs, each one handful; of the Flowers of Pomegranates half an ounce, of the grains of Sumach, and Mirtles, and of Hypociſtis, each two drams; of the Cups of Acorns, and of yellow and red Sanders, each one dram; of red Roſes three Pugils; boil them in Smith's-water with a little Vinegar, ſtrain the Liquor, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Reins with it warm. A Bath may be made of the ſame Decoction the quantity of it being increaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Juice of Plantane, and of Blood-wort, each two ounces; of Vinegar half an ounce, of Omphacine Oyl one ounce, boil them to the Conſumption of the Juices, then add of Dragons-blood, Maſtich, and of Pomegranate-peel, each two drams; of Champhor half a dram, of the Counteſſes Oynoment four ounces, of Wax a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; make a Liniment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anoint the Loins with it frequently; at the time you uſe it, mix a little Vinegar with it.</p>
                  <p>Leaden Plates with many holes in them, worn upon the Reins, are very proper.</p>
                  <p>When the Voiding of Blood proceeds from the Stone, the following Method has been found very ſucceſsful by Dr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> who was much troubled with the Gout, the Stone in the Kidneys, and a bloody Urine; and I have alſo found it very ſucceſsful, I drank, ſays he, two ounces and a half of Manna diſſolved in a quart of Whey, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing now and then a little of the Juice of Lemmons, while I was purging, to quicken this Cathartick, which uſed to work ſlowly, and to render it more pleaſant to the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:65404:154"/>
Stomach. It can ſcarce be ſaid how much Eaſe I received about the Region of the Reins by the uſe of this Remedy; for though they did not always ach before, yet they were affected with a heavy and troubleſom Pain; and becauſe it ſucceeded ſo well with me, I took the ſame of a ſet day once a Week for ſome Months, and after every Purge I plainly found my ſelf better, and could bear the ſhaking of a Coach when it went faſt, and was indeed wholly freed from this Symptom. But it returning again, ſome time after, I took it twice a Week for three Weeks, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards only once a Week: I continued this Method ſome Months on ſet Days, and the Bleeding quite ſtopped: The Diet that I obſerved is as follows, In the Morning when I riſe I drink a Diſh of Tea, at Dinner I moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreſh my ſelf with any ſort of Meat of eaſie Digeſtion that I like; a draught of ſmall Beer is to me inſtead of a Supper; and when I am in Bed I take another draught, that by this Julep I may cool and dilute the hot and acrid Juices lodged in the Kidneys, whereof the Stone is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; and I prefer at this time, and at Dinner time, ſmall Beer that has Hopps in it, before that which has none, for though that which is not hopped is ſmoother and ſofter, and ſo fitter to carry off the Stone from the Kidneys, yet that which is hopped, by reaſon of the ſtiptick Quality which the Hopps impart to it, is not ſo apt to generate ſandy and ſtony Matter, as that which is not hopped, the Subſtance whereof is more viſcous and ſlimy. I take care to go to Bed early, eſpecially in Winter; and to prevent a bloody Urine, I take care, that as often as I have occaſion to ride a long Way upon the Stones, to drink a large draught of ſmall Beer before I go; and alſo before my Return, if I be abroad a pretty while, whereby I ſecure my ſelf pretty well from bloody Urine.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XC. Of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer of the Reins and Bladder.</head>
                  <p>AN Ulcer is occaſioned in the Reins and Bladder by three Cauſes, firſt, from an Abſceſs broken, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Acrimony of the Humours, and thirdly, from
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:65404:155"/>
a rough Stone, and this is the moſt frequent and ordinary cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Among the Diagnoſtick Signs, the firſt and chief is the voiding of Matter with Urine, which continuing a while, certainly ſhews an Ulcer in the urinary Paſſages; but whither the Reins or the Bladder are affected with the Ulcer, may be known by the Situation of the Pain, as whether it be in the Region of the Loins, or in the Pubis, or Perinaeum. Moreover, Matter proceeding from the Reins is better concocted, is white, light, and not at all ſtinking, becauſe the Parenchyma of the Reins being fleſhy concocts better, and the Matter is alſo in a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and more mixt with the Urine, which looks like Milk, along while after voiding it the Matter is ſeperated from it, and falls to the Bottom of the Chamber-pot. But Purulent Matter flowing from the Bladder, is little and not much mixed with the Urine, nor ſo concocted, but crude, variegated and ſtinks much, for the Part having little Heat, cannot ſufficiently concoct the Matter, but from the Neck of the Bladder, or from the urinal Paſſage, pure Matter without Urine is often voided. Moreover, In an Ulcer of the Bladder or of its Neck, there is a continual Heat of Urine, and a continual Pain in the part, which is not ſo in an Ulcer of the Reins; for in that Ulcer the Heat of Urine and Pain ceaſe ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>When the Ulcer is deep, Blood ſometimes flows out plentifully, which is difficultly ſtopt, and often ſmall pieces of the Parts are voided with the Blood and Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> moſt commonly ſmall Caruncles from the Reins, ſometimes they are larger, and paſſing difficultly through the Ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they occaſion a Nephritick Pain, but from the Bladder ſmall Scales, or ſmall Membranous Skins flow like Bran.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, In a long and callous Ulcer of the Bladder, a mucous Flegm is produced.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick, theſe Ulcers are very difficultly cured, becauſe there is a perpetual Flux of Humours to the Part; for though the Serum of its own Nature is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, yet when it is infected with other qualities it is not ſo, and when acrid and ſalt Humours are mixed with it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:65404:155"/>Freſh Ulcers of the Reins and Bladder may be cured, but when they are inveterate they are incurable.</p>
                  <p>In old Men they can never be cured, in young Men they may ſometimes, but with great Difficulty.</p>
                  <p>Ulcers that are occaſioned by the Stone cannot be cured till the Stone is extracted.</p>
                  <p>The Pain and other Symptoms which accompany theſe Ulcers, occaſion Watchings, and waſte the Body, and at length the Sick is brought into a Cachexy and Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of the Ulcers of the Reins and Bladder, as of all other Ulcers, is performed by cleanſing, drying, and conſolidating Medicines. To which end the following things may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, if there be a Plethora, or an Inflammation of the Part, Bleeding muſt be ordered, firſt in the Arm, and afterwards in the Foot.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards Purging muſt be preſcribed frequently, that the vitious Humours abounding in the whole Body, and flowing to the Part affected may be evacuated; but only gentle and lenitive Medicines muſt be ordered, as Caſſia, Manna, Syrup of Roſes, Rubarb, and Agarick reduced to a Bolus, or ſome other ſolid Form, becauſe in a liquid Form they eaſily run to the Urinary Paſſage, and ſo increaſe the Acrimony. The following Electuary may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Polypody of the Oak, and of Liquoriſh raſped, each half an ounce; of the four greater Cold Seeds each one dram, of the Flowers of Violets, and Borrage, each half a pugil; of Jujubes ſix pair, of Damask Prunes three pair, of Raiſins half an ounce, of Senna cleanſed two ounces and an half; infuſe them a Night in Barley-water, boil them in the Morning and ſtrain them; afterwards diſſolve an ounce and an half of Manna in a ſufficient quantity of the Decoction, ſtrain it again, add to it three ounces of Caſſia freſh drawn; boil them to the Conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of an Electuary, adding at laſt half an ounce of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb powdered. The Doſe is one ounce once a Week two Hours before eating.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Caſſia two ounces, of Manna one ounce and an half, of the Pulp of Sebeſtines, and Tamarinds, each one ounce; of the Mucilage of the Seeds of Pſyllium ſix drams,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65404:156"/>
of the four greater cold Seeds each one dram, of Juice of Liquoriſh two drams, with Syrup of Roſes ſolutive make an Electuary. If you add Mercurius Dulcis to the Electua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries above mentioned it will ſucceed the better; for it is of great Vertue to cleanſe and heal all inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among Purgers Turpentine is reckoned, and is much commended in this caſe, becauſe it looſens the Belly, and cleanſes the Ulcer; half an ounce of it waſhed in Plantane water muſt be given in Powder of Liquoriſh; but it is chiefly to be uſed when the Urine is very mucous and thick.</p>
                  <p>Vomiting is much commended by many, whereof ſome provoke it before Meals with warm water and Oyl, with which only Remedy often repeated, they ſay this Diſeaſe has been cured. But it is to be noted, that Vomiting muſt be only uſed in thoſe that vomit eaſily, for violent Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting irritates the Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>After due Evacuations and Revulſions we muſt come to the uſe of ſuch things as cleanſe, the chief of which are Whey drank in a great quantity in the Morning, and ſmall Mead, whereof alſo ſix or eight ounces may be taken in a Morning, and it may be uſed for the ordinary Drink. A Decoction of Barley with Liquoriſh and Sugar may be uſed in the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>If Mead be thought too hot, the greater cold Seeds, or the Roots of Liquoriſh, and the Tops of Mallows may be boiled in it. Aſſes-milk alſo does not only cleanſe but it alſo conſolidates; but it muſt not be given when there is a Feaver; or the following Decoction may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſh-mallows half an ounce, of the Leaves of Plantane Agrimony, Maiden-hair, and the Tops of Mallows, each one handful; of the Seeds of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and of Mellons, with the Barks bruiſed, each half an ounce; of the grains of Alkakengi ſix drams, of Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh raſped one ounce, of whole Barley one pugil; boil them to a quart, in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve of Honey of Roſes three ounces, of Sugar-candy two ounces; make a Julep, whereof take eight ounces in a Morning, for ten Days. Thoſe things which are given for Diſeaſes of the Reins and Bladder, muſt be preſcribed in a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:65404:156"/>
for otherwiſe their Vertues will not reach the Parts affected.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But inſtead of all, <hi>Barnet</hi> or <hi>Epſom-water,</hi> or <hi>Tunbridge-waters</hi> may be uſed; for by the long uſe of them, the hot Intemperies will be corrected, and the Ulcers cleanſed and cured.</p>
                  <p>Some commend to dry up the Ichor, and to cleanſe and heal internal Ulcers, eſpecially in Patients of a Flegmatick Conſtitution, and for ſuch as have been at any Time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the French Pox, and when there is no Feaver nor Flux of Blood, a ſudorifick Decoction made of China, Sarſa-parilla, Saſſafras, or of Guajacum, to be taken for thirty Days or more, and that the ſecond Decoction ſhould be uſed for ordinary Drink, with a thin and drying Diet. In the mean time, leaſt the Bowels ſhould be too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by the uſe of this Decoction, they may be qualified by cooling Broths given about the Evening, and by anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reins with cooling Oyntments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the following Decoction is ſafer and more ſucceſsful in every caſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Sarſaparilla three ounces, of Lignum Lentiſcinum two ounces, of Saſſafras one ounce, of the Raſpings of Ivory and Harts-horn, each ſix ounces; of Jujubes, and Sebeſtines, each half an ounce; of Nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Wood four ounces, of Barley cleanſed two ounces; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe them twelve Hours in five pints of Fountain-water, boil it to three, for ſix Doſes to be taken twice a Day. Aromatiſe them with two drams of Cinnamon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Ulcer is ſufficiently cleanſed, which may be known, for that the Matter is voided with the Urine in a leſſer quantity, and is white, and does not ſtink at all, Aſtringent things and ſuch as heal muſt be given,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Bole-Armenick, of ſealed Earth, and of red Coral, each three drams; of Gum-Arabick, and Tragacanth, each half an ounce; make Troches with Agrimony-Water, weighing each two drams; one of them must be taken Morning and Evening with a Decoction of Comfry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Dr. <hi>Gordon</hi>'s Troches are better than all the reſt, to cleanſe and heal Ulcers of the Reins and Bladder; and at the ſame time eaſe the Pain, and take off the Heat of Urine; two drams of them may be taken at a time in Mead, or a Decoction of Barley, when you deſign moſt to cleanſe; and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:65404:157"/>
in Goats or rather Sheeps Milk, when you chiefly deſign to heal.</p>
                  <p>Conſolidating Juleps may be made in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Comfry two ounces; of the Leaves of Plantane, and Mouſe-ear, each one handful; of the Tops of Mallows, and Maiden-hair, each half a handful; of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoriſh raſped half an ounce, of White-ſtarch, Gum-ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, Tragacanth, and Bole-armenick, each one dram; of the Seeds of Lettice, Purſlain, each one dram; of the ſeeds of red Roſes one pugil; make a Decoction in Rain-water to one Pint and an half; in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve four ounces of Sugar, and two ounces of Penids; make a Julep, whereof let him take eight ounces in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for ten or twelve Days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following Pills are alſo very good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſh-mallows, and of Comfry dried, of Gum-arabick, and of the Gum of the Cherry-tree, and Prune, each one dram; of Olybanum and Mirrh, each four ſcruples; of the Seeds of white Poppies, and of Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kengi, each one dram and an half; of Camphor two ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; powder them finely, or with a third part of the Weight of all of Ceruſs, of Antimony, and with a ſuffici-quantity of Venice Turpentine, make a Maſs for Pills, whereof let him take a dram Morning and Evening.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Turpentine ſhould cauſe Pain, the Juice of Liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh may be uſed inſtead of it; but new Cows-milk is the beſt of all, a quarter of a pint of it being taken with half a dram of Bole-armenick every Morning.</p>
                  <p>In inveterate Ulcers a Decoction of round Birth-wort in White-wine ſweetned with Sugar is very beneficial.</p>
                  <p>The following Oyntment may be uſed outwardly to conſolidate the Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Juice of Plantane, and Night-ſhade, each four ounces; of Oyl of Roſes Omphacine three ounces, of Vinegar one ounce, of Letharge finely powdered one ounce and an half, of Ceruſs waſhed half an ounce, of Tutty finely pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two drams; of Dragons-blood one dram; reduce them all to the Form of an Oyntment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Injections are peculiarly proper for an Ulcer of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they muſt be uſed twice a Day: Firſt, Such as cleanſe made of Hydromel, of Whey, or a Decoction of Barley,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:65404:157"/>
with a littie Honey of Roſes; but afterwards aſtringent and conſolidating Injections muſt be uſed, wherein the Roots of Comfry, Mirrh, Allum, Sarcocoll, and Traga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canth have been boiled; Dr. <hi>Gordon</hi>'s Troches diſſolved in Milk are of excellent uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fabritius Hildanus</hi> cured a great Ulcer of the Bladder with the following Injection, and with ſome other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. See his 69 Obſervation, Cent. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Comfry one ounce, of whole Barley one handful, of the Leaves of Agrimony, Speedwell, Scordium, Ladies-mantle, Sanicle, each half a handful; boil them to a Pint; in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve of Honey of Roſes two drams; mingle them, make an Injection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to be noted, that theſe Injections are not to be ſquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in with a Syringe, becauſe they do not penetrate into the Cavity of the Bladder, the Sphincter Muſcle hindering; but a Catheter being put into the Bladder, you muſt ſyringe through it, and ſo the Injection will reach the Part affected.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe theſe Ulcers are commonly painful, all the courſe of the Cure you muſt endeavour to mitigate the Pain with Anodynes taken inwardly, and uſed out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, Syrup of Poppies, London Laudanum, and the Troches of Alkakengi, which are peculiarly proper in this caſe, muſt be uſed inwardly: Alſo Emulſions of the cold Seeds, of the Seeds of white Poppies, adding if there be occaſion, Syrup of Poppies. And laſtly, The Conſerve of the Flowers of Marſh-mallows muſt be frequently given.</p>
                  <p>And the following Fomentation may be uſed to the Region of the Reins,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſh-mallows, of the Leaves of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Pellitory, and Violets, each one handful; of the ſeeds of Flax, Fenugreek, and Alkakengi, each three drams; of the Flowers of Camomil, Melilot, and Water-lillies, each one Pugil; make a Decoction, wherewith fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Part with Flannels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the Fomentation uſe the following Liniment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oyl of Violets, and of ſweet Almonds, each one ounce and an half; of Oyl of Roſes one ounce, of the Mucilages of the Seeds of Marſhmallows and Fenugreek, each two ounces; of Suffron one ſcruple; make a Liniment.</hi>

                  <p>THis Diſeaſe was ſo rare amongſt the Ancients, that many famous Phyſicians made no mention of it; but in our Age, wherein exceſſive Drinking has been, eſpecially of Wine, ſo much uſed, there are many Inſtances of it.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, The chief intentions of Healing, are to prevent fuſion of the Blood, and to take off that which is ſo. Firſt, The Fuſion of the Blood is hindred, when its groſs and watry Parts contain one another, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, ſo that they do not too haſtily ſeparate, which may be effected by thickning Remedies; and for this Purpoſe Rice, Starch, and Mucilaginous Vegetables, alſo Gums, and ſome reſinous things are of uſe. Secondly, That the Fuſion of the Blood may be taken off, ſuch Remedies are indicated as diſſolve the Concretions of the Salts. I have preſcribed in this Diſeaſe, the Tincture of Antimony with good ſucceſs, and Lime-water, with the Seeds of Anniſe, Raiſins, and Liquoriſh, is much commended by ſome.</p>
                  <p>A Noble-man fell into a deſperate Diabetes, for beſides that, he voided a Gallon and an half of clear Urine, that was almoſt as ſweet as Honey, in the ſpace of a Night and a Day; he was alſo afflicted with great Thirſt, a Hectick Feaver, great Weakneſs, and with a waſting of the whole Body; he was cured in a ſhort time by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Medicines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Tops of Cypreſs eight handfuls, of the Whites of Eggs a quart, of Cinnamon half an ounce; having cut them ſmall, pour upon them four Quarts of new Milk, and diſtill them in a cold Still. Have a care of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrema. He took ſix ounces of it thrice a day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Gum-Arabick, and Tragacanth, each ſix drams; of Penediate Sugar one ounce, make a Powder; give one
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:65404:158"/>

                  <p>His Diet was altogether in a manner of Milk, which he eat ſometimes crude, ſometimes boiled, with Bread or Barley; ſometimes it was diluted with a diſtilled water, or with Barley-water.</p>
                  <p>When he had been well a long time, he fell into the ſame Diſeaſe again, and the ſame Method and Medicines were ordered again, whereby he grew better in a few Days; afterwards he took five or ſix ounces of Lime-water daily thrice in a Day; and having uſed it four days, he voided Urine in a moderate quantity well coloured and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſalt.

                  <head>CHAP. XCII. Of Incontinence of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</head>
                  <p>INcontinence of Urine proceeds from a fault of the reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty of the Bladder; it befalls either People waking, and then the cauſe is great, or ſleeping, and then it is leſs, for at that time the Animal Functions are not ſo freely exerciſed; and this happens two Ways, <hi>viz.</hi> Either by the Weakneſs, or Laxity of the Sphincter Muſcle of the Bladder; which ſucking Children are ſubject to, old People, and ſome in their middle Age, and others by falſe Imagination; for many there are, who by reaſon of exceſſive Drinking, or by reaſon of the exquiſite ſenſe of the Bladder, or ſharp Urine, piſs in Bed, in ſome ſort willingly; for they imagine in their Sleep, that they are making Water againſt the Wall or ſome other Place; and they are ſo accuſtomed to this Vice, that they do it where there is no Fault either in Bladder or Muſcle of it, and they
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:65404:159"/>
are not cured by Medicines, but by rectifying their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, as in Children by the Rod, and in grown People by placing ſome precious things upon the Places where they think they make water in their Dreams; and by ſhewing ſuch things to them often.</p>
                  <p>But a preternatural Diſorder occaſioning an Incontinence of Urine, is ſeated in the Sphincter Muſcle, which is either affected Sympathically, or Idiopathically, it is affected by Sympathy many Ways, as when the whole Body is weak, and the Natural Heat decayed, as when Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, or when the whole Body, or half of it, is ſeiſed with the Palſie, or thoſe Branches of the Nerves only, which ariſing from the Os ſacrum, are communicated to the Bladder. This Reſolution of the Muſcles, is occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ſometimes by reaſon of the Nearneſs to other Parts affected; as in Women with Child, in ſwellings and Pains of the Womb, and great Diſeaſes of the right Gut.</p>
                  <p>But the Sphincter Muſcle is alſo affected various ways, Idiopathically, as by Wounds upon it, as it happens in cutting for the Stone, or by reaſon of deep Wounds that hinder the Contraction and Shutting of it; but the chief and moſt frequent cauſe, is a cold and moiſt Intemperies, whereby that part is weakned and relaxed. This Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries is much furthered by a natural cold and moiſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, by Childhood, Age; the Feminine Sex, by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the whole Body, or of ſome Parts ariſing from a cold and moiſt Intemperies, to which may be added, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſes proper to produce ſuch an Intemperies.</p>
                  <p>The Diagnoſtick Signs of this Diſeaſe, either ſhew a Sympathick Diſeaſe, which are to be taken from the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects proper to produce an Incontinence of Urine mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above; and if they are preſent, we muſt ſuppoſe the Diſeaſe proceeds thence; but if they are abſent we muſt count it Idiopathick; and if it be occaſioned by a Wound, Ulcer, or any other Diſorder of the Sphincter, it is eaſily known, but if none of theſe appear, we muſt conſider whither there be a cold and moiſt Intemperies of the part, which may be known by the Conſtitution of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and external Cauſes, and by the Effects of them; as ſoftneſs of the whole Body, a pale Colour, a Laxity of the Genus Nervoſum, and of the genital parts by Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Age, and a Flegmatick Cachexy, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:65404:159"/>As to the Prognoſtick. This Diſeaſe is incurable in old Age, in a Feaver it is dangerous; but it may be cured in Children by increaſe of Years, for in time the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Moiſture may be conſumed, and the lax parts rendered firm and ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of Involuntary Urine muſt be directed to the correcting of the cold and moiſt Intemperies, and to the Laxity of the Sphincter Muſcle, for that which is occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Sympathy from other Parts primarily affected, muſt be referred to the Cure of thoſe Diſeaſes; and that which proceeds from a Wound, Ulcer, and other manifeſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, depends on the Cure of them; wherefore the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Method of Cure muſt be obſerved, both for Children and grown People; but in Children the moſt gentle Medicines muſt be uſed, and they muſt be doſed accoding to their Age.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Bleeding is not of uſe in this caſe, unleſs there be a Plethora of the whole Body in Youth, but Purges are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways neceſſary in this caſe; they muſt be made of Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogue Medicines, and aſtringent things may be mixed with them, eſpecially ſuch as purge too, as Rubarb, Miro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanes, and the like.

                  <head>CHAP. XCIII. Of a total Suppreſſion of Urine, and of the Strangury.</head>
                  <p>A Total Suppreſſion of Urine is called by Authors Iſchuria, but when the voiding of Urine is leſſened they term it a Strangury.</p>
                  <p>An Iſchuria or total Suppreſſion of Urine is twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> true when the Bladder is full, and falſe when the Bladder is empty, and nothing comes from the Reins to it.</p>
                  <p>The true Iſchury depends on three Cauſes, the firſt whereof is Senſe aboliſhed in the Bladder by reaſon of a Palſie or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of its Nerve, or becauſe the Spirits are diverted ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way, as in a Delirium or the like.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond cauſe is a cold Intemperies of the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>The third Cauſe is a narrowneſs of the Neck of the Bladder, and of this three Cauſes are aſſigned, for the Muſcle incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the Neck of the Bladder is ſo ſwelled that the Paſſage is ſtopt, or a Caruncle grows in the Neck of the Bladder, or a Callus is generated there, the Paſſage is alſo obſtructed by a Stone, by a thick Humour, a Clot of Blood, or by Matter. The Paſſage is alſo ſtopt by a Swelling of the neighbouring parts, as by a large Child in the Womb, by the Excrements hardened in the right Gut, and by the Piles much ſwelled.</p>
                  <p>This Suppreſſion alſo happens ſometimes by too great a quantity of Water retained too long, that ſo much diſtend, the whole Body of the Bladder, that it cannot be contracted to expel it; firſt, when any Perſon that is well retains his Urine for want of a Convenient Place to void it in, or when the Nerves of the Bladder are affected, ſo that the Bladder cannot be ſenſible of the Weight and Fulneſs.</p>
                  <p>A falſe iſchury is occaſioned by reaſon either the Serum is not put off upon the Reins, or not conveighed through the Ureters, they being ſtopt by a Stone or the like.</p>
                  <p>A true Iſchury is known by a Weight and Tenſion of the Hypogaſter, and by a Swelling reſembling the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes of it are known by things that go before, and accompany it; for if it proceed from a large quantity of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:65404:161"/>
Urine, which hinders a Contraction of the Bladder, it is perceived by the Relation of the Sick, he having omitted to make Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by reaſon of long travelling, or by being in the preſence of great Perſons; and if he never had it before in thoſe parts; but if he be delirious or paralitick, the Suppreſſion of Urine may be imputed to either of theſe Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The Compreſſion that is made by Tumours, of thoſe or of the neighbouring parts, or by other Cauſes above mentioned may be known by the proper Signs of thoſe Diſeaſes. The Obſtructions of the Channel of the Bladder may be known by probing it with a Wax Candle, or a Catheter; and if they do not penetrate, but ſtop in the Paſſage, it is a Sign that a Stone or a Caruncle, or ſome other Matter obſtructs; and theſe things that obſtruct may be diſtinguiſhed, <hi>viz.</hi> If a Stone ſtop the Channel, Nephritick Pains went before, if it fell from the Reins, and if it was bred in the Bladder, or lay a long while there, the Signs of the Stone in the Bladder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, at leaſt ſome of the gentleſt of them; if a Caruncle ſtop the Paſſage, a virulent Gonorrhea preceded, or an Ulcer in the Paſſage of the Yard, that emitted purulent Matter for a long time. Laſtly, If clotted Blood, or concreted Matter, or thick Pus, occaſioned the Obſtruction, ſmall parts of them have been evacuated through the Yard, or have ſtuck to the Catheter, when it has been uſed.</p>
                  <p>A falſe Iſchury may be known, for that there is no Tenſion nor no Tumour nor Weight in the Region of the Pubis, but rather a Vacuity is perceived there; there is no deſire of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water, nor no Irritation of the Bladder; and when the Catheter is uſed it paſſes in eaſily; but Signs of the Stone in the Kidneys went before, or of an Inflammation of the Ureters, or of great Fullneſs, or large Drinking went before, but little Urine followed; upon which account the Veins were too much filled. Or Laſtly, there is a burning Feaver or a Dropſie, whereby the Serous Matter is diverted.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick, A Suppreſſion of Urine is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, if it exceed the Seventh Day it certainly kills, for the Serum regurgitates upon the whole Body, and the Patient is in danger of a Suffocation, or a Coma.</p>
                  <p>Suppreſſion of Urine, occaſioned by a Wound in the Spine, or by reaſon of a Luxation of a Vertebra is incurable.</p>
                  <p>If the Smell of Urine can be perceived from the Mouth, or Noſtrils of the Sick, it is deadly.</p>
                  <p>If a Teneſmus come upon a Suppreſſion of Urine, the Sick dies in ſeven Days. The Hickops alſo indicate ſudden Death.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of a Suppreſſion of Urine, whether it be total or partial, is to be directed to the taking off the Cauſes: And
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65404:161"/>
Firſt, The falſe Iſchury, that depends on the Diſeaſes of the Reins or Ureters, muſt be cured in the ſame manner as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, a nephritick Pain, or the Stone in the Kidneys: But that which proceeds from a Fulneſs of the Emulgent Veins muſt be cured by large Bleeding, and by Hydragogue Medicines.</p>
                  <p>A true Iſchury muſt be alſo cured by Remedies that take off the cauſe producing it. And Firſt, If it proceed from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Bladder, or neighbouring Parts, it muſt be cured as an Inflammation of the Bladder is; but if the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is cauſed by a Stone thruſt into the Neck of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it muſt be removed by the following Remedies. Firſt, The Sick muſt be laid upon his Back, and his Legs muſt be elevated, and he muſt be ſhook much, and a long while, that the Stone may fall back into the Bladder; and if by this means it cannot be moved, it muſt be forced back with a Catheter; but if the Stone has paſſed into the Paſſage of the Yard, we muſt endeavour by all Ways to exclude it, by moving gently with the Fingers towards the end of the Yard, and alſo by dipping the Yard into warm Milk, or by placing the Sick in a Bath, to enlarge the Paſſage: But if it will neither go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards nor forwards, Practitioners teach that it muſt be cut out, the upper and lower part being tied.</p>
                  <p>But an Obſtruction of the Neck of the Bladder, which proceeds from an Inflammation, muſt be cured by proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for an Inflammation. But in the mean time, if the Urine be retained too long, it may be gently let out by a Wax-candle dipt in Oyl of ſweet Almonds: But you muſt forbear the Uſe of a Catheter, leaſt Pain being occaſioned, you ſhould increaſe the Inflammation thereby.</p>
                  <p>But the Suppreſſion of Urine, which proceeds from a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runcle, muſt be cured by the Extirpation of the Caruncle.</p>
                  <p>This muſt be done by proper Remedies thruſt in by a skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Chirurgion upon a Wax-candle. But Neceſſity urging, for ſometimes the Caruncle ſwells, and obſtructs the whole Channel, we muſt uſe the Catheter to evacuate the Water, though there is danger that the Part will ſwell more. But you muſt firſt endeavour to leſſen the Inflation of the Caruncle by Bleeding and Vomiting, and by repelling Medicines applied to the Pubes and Perinaeum.</p>
                  <p>If the Suppreſſion of Urine be occaſioned by thick Flegm, Purging is firſt convenient, with Diaphaenicon and Rubarb made up in a Bolus, and afterwards Turpentine muſt be given frequently with Powder of Liquoriſh; afterwards a Decoction of the opening Roots may be given, with Oxymel and Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Syrup.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="310" facs="tcp:65404:162"/>In the mean while Gliſters, Fomentations, and emollien and opening Baths muſt be uſed; and all thoſe things are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that are propoſed to diſſolve or expell the Stone. And amongſt the reſt the following are found by Experience pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly proper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Benedictum Laxativum half an ounce, of the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Mirrh two ſcruples, of a Decoction of Savin three ounces; mingle them, make a Potion, whereby a Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Urine was cured in a ſhort time in a certain Woman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there ſeem to be abundance of Flegm in the whole Body, a univerſal Purge by an Apozem prepared for three or four Days muſt be ordered, which is proper at the beginning, Bleeding being firſt uſed. A Julep alſo of the Juice of Pellito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, of Sea-fennel, and of Lemmons, with Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, is alſo very beneficial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dodoneus</hi> mentions an Obſervation of one of eighty Years of Age, that was perfectly cured of a Suppreſſion of Urine, by only uſing once a Lee made of the Aſhes of Egg-ſhells, mixed with Rheniſh-wine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arnoldus Villa Novanus</hi> commends Winter-cherry-wine, and he mentions a Cardinal, who had not made Urine for four Days, and was much ſwelled, was cured by drinking Winter-cherry-wine; the Wine was made by beating five or ſeven or more winter-cherries with good White-wine; afterwards it muſt be ſtrained. Millepedes alſo beat and given in White-wine are very Effectual to provoke Urine; Oyl of Scorpions of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiolus alſo forces Urine powerfully, five or ſix drops of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given with Broth or ſome other Liquor. The frequent uſe of Sal-prunella does alſo the ſame, eſpecially when there is danger of an Inflammation, which is often occaſioned in the inner Coat by the Urine too long retained; Spirit of Salt alſo does the ſame, but is more effectual; the Juice of Pellitory clarified, and four ounces of it given with half an ounce of Sugar is very good; Sal-prunella, or the Spirit of Salt may be mixed with it.</p>
                  <p>If Suppreſſion of Urine occaſioned by a phlegmatick Matter often recur, nothing is better than the Bath-waters, which eaſily diſſolve and cleanſe away the Mucilaginous Matter.</p>
                  <p>A certain Nobleman, that was afflicted with a Suppreſſion of Urine for many Days, after other Medicines uſed to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, was freed by injecting the following Glyſter, which he retained two Hours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Smallage and Parſly, Knee holm, Aſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragous Mallows, each two drams; of Pellitory two handfuls, of the Seeds of Anniſe, Fennel, Daucus, Biſhop-weed, baſtard Saffron, Rue, Cummi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and Juniper-berries, each half an
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65404:162"/>
ounce; of the Flowers of Camomil, Mellilot, Dill, and Stoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas, each two Pugils; boil them in Whitewine till half is conſumed; in one Pint of the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve four ounces of freſh Butter, of Honey of Roſes two ounces, of red Sugar one ounce, of Benedictum Laxativum half an ounce, of the Yolk of one Egg, of Oyls of Nuts, Dill, or Linſeeds, one ounce; make a Gliſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the whole Courſe of the Cure Fomentations, Liniments, Cataplaſms, Baths, and the like, muſt be uſed; among other things a Cataplaſm of Pellitory fried with Butter, or rather with Oyl of Scorpions is good; alſo a Bladder half full of Oyl wherein Cantharides have been boyled. A Cataplaſm made of Onyons fried in Lard and with ſome Oyl, is commonly applied to the Region of the Pubis and Loins.</p>
                  <p>When an Iſchury proceeds from clotted Blood, Troches of Ambar, Mumny, ſimple Oxymel, Oxymel of Squills, Syrup of Sorrel, and the like, muſt be uſed; and Cow-dung out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly applied does Wonders.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, when the Suppreſſions proceeds from Pus, things that cleanſe and incide muſt be uſed, ſuch chiefly as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for an Ulcer of the Reins and Bladder.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XCIV. Of a Dyſury, or Heat of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</head>
                  <p>THe next and immediate Cauſe of rendring Urine with Pain, is a Solution of the Continuum in the Sphincter Muſcle, or Channel of the Bladder, and therefore whatſoever cauſes Solution of the Continuum in thoſe Parts, occaſions alſo a Dyſury or Heat of Urine.</p>
                  <p>Among theſe Cauſes, the chief and moſt frequent is an Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Urine, ſometimes ſimple without the Mixture of other Humours, which a hot Intemperies of the Bowels, or of the whole Body, or the uſe of acrid and hot Meats, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions it. But it is moſt commonly from a Mixture of acrid Humours, ſometimes Matter flowing from the Reins or Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ulcerated, occaſion ſuch an Acrimony in the Urine, and ſometimes a white and Milky Matter that is emitted plentifully with the Urine, occaſions the Heat of it; alſo a Stone in the Bladder, or Gravel produces the ſame. Laſtly, An Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as in a Gonorrhea, as long as the Proſtratae are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, the Heat of Urine continues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="312" facs="tcp:65404:163"/>The Signs of the Cauſes may be thus diſtinguiſhed, If it proceeds from an Acrimony, the Urine is thin and high co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, or there will be a Mixture of Purulent Matter, and an Intemperies of the Bowels went before, or hot and acrid Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Heat of the Air or the like heating cauſes preceded. Laſtly, Stones and Inflammations of theſe parts, may be known by their proper Signs.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick, This Diſeaſe is not of it ſelf dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, but is very troubleſome to the Patient, and is ſometimes difficultly cured, eſpecially in old Men, who, if they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepid, have it as long as they live; and if it continue long in any Age, it ulcerates the Neck of the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is firſt to be directed to the taking off the Cauſe; and therefore if it ariſe from the Stone, an Inflammation, or from an Ulcer of the Bladder, or the Neck of it, the Cure muſt be taken from the Chapters of theſe Diſeaſes; but thoſe things which are mentioned below, may much abate the Symptom.</p>
                  <p>But that which proceeds from an Acrimony of Urine, and from hot Humours mixed with it, muſt be cured with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Remedies.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, To qualifie the Intemperies of the Parts, frequent Bleeding is neceſſary, and it muſt be often repeated, if there be a great quantity of Blood, or danger of an Inflammation: Purges are alſo convenient in this Diſeaſe, but they muſt be lenitive and cooling, for otherwiſe they mightily exaſperate the Heat of Urine, wherefore ſome do not dare to give any thing beſides a ſimple Bolus of Caſſia; and this is certainly to be preferred before all other things. Yet it may be made more cooling if Tamarinds are added to it, or a Decoction of Lettice, Purſlain, and the Tops of Mallows with Caſſia, may be taken for many Days, that the acrid Humours flowing to the Urina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parts, may be by degrees turned upon the Bowels, but yet if a large quantity of ill Humours requires more Purging, we may uſe the following Potion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves of Lettice, Purſlain, Plantane, and the Tops of Mallows, each half an ounce; of Tamarinds, half a dram, of yellow Mirobalans one dram; boil them to ſix oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve one ounce of Caſſia freſh drawn; ſtrain them again, and afterwards add the Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one dram and an half of Rubarb in Lettice water, with yellow Sanders, of Manna, and of Syrup of Roſes, each one ounce; make a Potion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vomiting alſo, with gentle Remedies, is excellent, for it makes Revulſion from the Part affected, and does not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thoſe Diſorders that Purging does; and therefore ſuch as
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65404:163"/>
can bear Vomiting well, may take a gentle Vomit once or twice a Week. Gliſters alſo frequently injected do good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſh-mallows one ounce, of the Leaves of Mallows, Violets, and Lettice, each one handful; of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Water-lillies, and of Barley cleanſed, each one Pugil; boil them to a Pint, in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve an ounce of Caſſia newly extracted, one whole Egg, and two ounces of Oyl of Violets; make a Gliſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Mucilages of the Seeds of Marſh mallows, Quinces, Fenugreek, may be mixed with Gliſters to eaſe the Pain.</p>
                  <p>But to qualifie the Heat, and to eaſe the Pain, Gliſters of Milk by it ſelf or mixed with the foregoing things are uſually ſo effectual, that I have known ſome eaſed of long Pains with this Remedy only, and by the Bath which ſhall be mentioned by and by.</p>
                  <p>But many things may be given inwardly to aſſwage the Pain, and to correct the Intemperies of the Parts affected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Purſlain, Lettice, and Water-lillies, each one ounce; of the Syrup of Violets, and of Water-lillies, each ſix drams; Sal-prunella one dram; mingle them, make a Julep to be repeated often.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Emulſions may be alſo uſed, though they are diuretick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cool and gently cleanſe the Urinary Paſſages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the four greater cold Seeds, and of White Poppies, each three drams; of Sweet Almonds blanched, and infuſed in cold water, half an ounce; bruiſe them in a Marble Mortar, and pour upon them gently a pint and an half of the Decoction of Barly, of Liquoriſh, and the Tops of Mallows; make an Emulſion for three Doſes, adding to each one ounce of Syrup of Violets, and a dram of Sal-prunella; if the Pain be very violent, ſome Syrup of Poppies may be added to it, and a dram of Gum Arabick powdered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Broths may be alſo prepared in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſhmallows half an ounce, of Mallows one handful, of Liquoriſh half an ounce, of the Seeds of Quinces one dram; boil them with Chicken Broth, and let it be taken for ſeveral Days together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Whey of Goats Milk is alſo very good, a large draught of it being taken at a time; and if there be no Feaver, milk it ſelf is more effectual, eſpecially Aſſes Milk.</p>
                  <p>If the Diſeaſe is inveterate, <hi>Epſom</hi> and <hi>Tunbridge</hi>-waters are very proper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Foreſtus</hi> cured himſelf of a violent Dyſury, by only uſing a Decoction of Mallows ſweetned with Syrup of Violets; a Conſerve of Mallows has alſo done much good, an ounce of it having been taken Morning and Evening, and three ounces
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:65404:164"/>
of Mallow-Water being drank preſently after; the Conſerve of the Flowers of Marſhmallows is as good or rather better; ſome Practitioners commend the Troches of Alkakengi; a dram of them being taken at a Time in ſome proper Liquor.</p>
                  <p>When the Pain is very violent, the dipping the Yard in Milk, whilſt the Urine is rendring, or in a Decoction of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and the Seeds of white Poppies, does much good in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſmall decoction of Mallows ſweetned with Syrup of Violets, or with Conſerve of Roſes, is very proper for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Drink.</p>
                  <p>And to eaſe the Pain, Injections may be made for the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Bladder of Milk, an Emulſion of the cold Seeds of Plantane and Whey, whereunto may be added the White of an Egg well beaten, and a Scruple of the Troches of Alkaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi. External Remedies do alſo much good to qualifie the Heat of Urine, as Baths and Fomentations applied to the Pubis and Perinaeum, made of a Decoction of cooling Herbs; alſo Liniments made of Oyls of Roſes, of white-lillies, and of Oyntment of Roſes, and of the white Oyntment with Camphor.</p>

                  <p>THe Green-Sickneſs is a vitious Habit of the Body proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Obſtructions, it is accompanied moſt commonly with a Palpitation of the Heart, Difficulty of Breathing, and a longing for abſurd things, and with an Unfitneſs for Motion, and other Symptoms.</p>
                  <p>The Diagnoſtick manifeſtly appears by the following Series of Symptoms. Firſt, The Face and whole Body is pale, and ſometimes of a leaden, livid, and green Colour. Secondly, An Inflation, and as it were a Swelling, appears upon the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids; the Legs alſo ſwell, eſpecially about the Ankles. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is a Dulneſs and Unwillingneſs for Motion. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, There is a Difficulty of Breathing, eſpecially when they move much, or go up Stairs. Fifthly, There is a Palpitation of the Heart upon Motion. Sixthly, There is a heavy, and often a laſting pain of the Head. Seventhly, The Pulſe is quick. Eighthly, The Sick are drowſie, and incline to Sleep. Ninthly, There is a great Averſion for wholeſome Food. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The Diſeaſe increaſing, and the Obſtructions being multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, a Suppreſſion of the Courſes at length follows which ſhews the Diſeaſe is confirmed.</p>

                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:65404:164"/>As to the Prognoſtick, This Diſeaſe moſt commonly is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When the Diſeaſe is ſmall, and chiefly ariſes from Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Veins of the Womb, it is eaſily cured by Marriage in Young Virgins.</p>
                  <p>Women that have had this Diſeaſe a long while, are either barren, or bring forth Children that are Sickly and ſhort liv'd.</p>
                  <p>There is great Hopes of Cure, when the Courſes keep their exact Periods, and flow in a due Quantity and Quality.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is performed by opening Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by purging off the vitious Humours, by Correcting the Intemperies of the Bowels, and by Strengthning them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, A gentle Purging Medicine muſt be given that is agreeable to the Conſtitution, that the firſt Region may be only emptied; and if the Belly be bound, a Gliſter muſt be given firſt of all.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards Bleeding muſt be ordered, unleſs the Diſeaſe is very inveterate, and the Maid be inclined to a Cachexy.</p>
                  <p>But a Vein in the Arm muſt be opened, though the Courſes are ſtopped, for at that Time if you ſhould bleed in the Foot, the Obſtructions of the Veins and of the Womb would be increaſed: That quantity of Blood being taken away that is neceſſary, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Purges muſt be uſed, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Let theſe Pills be repeated twice or thrice every Morning, or every other Morning, according to the Strength of the Sick and their Operation.</p>

                  <head>CAHP. XCVI. Of the Suppreſſion of the Courſes.</head>
                  <p>THere is ſaid to be a Suppreſſion of the Courſes, when in Women of a mature Age, that neither give ſuck, nor are with Child, the Evacuation of Blood by the Womb, which naturally is wont to be monthly, ſeldom or ſparingly proceeds or is wholly ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſe of this Suppreſſion, is to be referred either to the Womb or to the Veſſels of it, or to the Blood which flows or ought to flow through them.</p>
                  <p>Various Diſeaſes of the Womb may occaſion this Suppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, namely a cold moiſt Intemperies, or a hot and dry Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries; alſo organical Diſeaſes of the Part, as an Inflammation, or Scirrhus, or the like. The Veſſels of the Womb alſo often occaſion Obſtructions, which is the moſt frequent cauſe of the Suppreſſion of the Courſes, they being ſtopt by cold and thick Humours, or compreſſed by Swellings of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts.</p>
                  <p>The Blood is peccant, when it is thick and Clammy, or when it is evacuated by other ways, as by the Noſtrils, Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Spitting, Hemorrhoides, and many other Parts. I ſaw, ſayes <hi>Riverius,</hi> a Girl that had a Puſtle in the Head which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Monthly, and evacuated a large quantity of Blood; and I have ſeen many, ſays he, that by caſting up Blood Periodically from the Lungs, had the Courſes that Way.</p>
                  <p>The external Cauſes occaſioning this Suppreſſion, are cold and dry Air, and a Northerly Seaſon going into Cold Water, eſpecially when the Courſes flow, too little or too much Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65404:165"/>
taken, alſo groſs and cold Meats, or ſuch as are aſtringent and ſuch as are too hot, or ſuch as are ſalted and ſpiced too much, violent exerciſe, immoderate Watchings, much ſleep, immoderate Eaſe, Bleeding at the Noſe, or Piles, a Looſneſs, and other Evacuations by Vomit, Urine, and Sweat: And laſtly, violent Paſſions, as extream Anger, a ſudden Fright, long Sorrow, great Jealouſie, and the like.</p>
                  <p>The Diagnoſtick of the Suppreſſion muſt be received from the Sick; but becauſe it proceeds both from natural and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural cauſes, the Signs of both ſhall be diſtinctly propoſed, leaſt Phyſicians ſhould be deceived by Women being with Child, by illegitimate Coition, and ſo preſcribe Medicines to provoke the Courſes raſhly to Women with Child.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, Women with Child moſt commonly retain their natural Colour, and others do not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Symptoms which uſe to happen to Women with Child, at the beginning abate daily; but on the contrary, in a Suppreſſion of the Courſes, the longer they are ſtopt, ſo much the more the Symptoms are increaſed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In Women with Child, after the third Month, the Motion and Situation of the Child may be ſenſibly perceived, by laying the hand on the Belly; but in others the Swelling is Oedematous, and not at all hard; nor is it always contained within the Limits of the Womb.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, If the inward Mouth of the Womb be touched by a Skilful Midwife, ſhe will find it not exactly cloſed, as it is in Women with Child, but rather hard, contracted, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what painful.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Women with Child are moſt commonly chearful; but on the contrary in a Suppreſſion they are moſt commonly ſorrowful and ſad.</p>
                  <p>The Faults of the Womb which occaſion a Suppreſſion, may be ſeen by Inſpection, and be felt by touching the Parts.</p>
                  <p>The Obſtruction and Narrowneſs of the Veſſels of the Womb, may be known by the Diſorder that is felt in the Loyns, and in the Parts near the Womb, eſpecially juſt before the Coming of the Courſes; and if any thing flows out it is mucous, whitiſh or blackiſh. The Diſeaſes of the neighbouring Parts, which ſtop the Mouth of the Womb, or the Veins, may be known by their proper Signs.</p>
                  <p>An abundance of Blood may be known by the Veins being much ſwelled in the Legs and Arms, if the Woman be fleſhy, and of a ruddy Countenance, and has indulged her ſelf for a long while in high Eating. But a Defect of Blood may be gueſſed at, if the Woman be fat, if ſhe has had a long Feaver, and has faſted a long while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or has loathed he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

quality of the Blood may be known by an ill Habit of Body; the prepoſterous Motion of the Blood, <hi>viz.</hi> When it flows by contrary Paſſages, is manifeſt of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick, a Suppreſſion of the Courſes is very dangerous, and many deſperate Diſeaſes riſe from it; ſome in the Womb, as Tumours Abſceſſes, and Ulcers; others in the whole Body, and in various Parts, as Feavers, Obſtructions, Cachexies, Loathing of Meat, a Dropſie, a Cardialgia, a Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Fainting, Melancholly, Madneſs, Pains of the Head, Gout, and many others; if the Suppreſſion continue long the Belly grows hard, great quantity of Urine is voided, there is a Loathing of Meat, and long Watching, the Legs, Feet, and Belly ſwell, and they die of a Dropſie.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe muſt be varied according to the Variety of the Cauſes. And firſt, If it proceed from too great a quantity of Blood, Bleeding muſt be ordered in the Arm, and a large quantity of Blood muſt be taken away, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards it muſt be drawn downwards by opening the lower Veins, about the time the Woman uſed to have her Courſes before ſhe was ill.</p>
                  <p>Frictions, Ligatures, Cupping-glaſſes, with and without Scari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>If by reaſon of want of Blood the Courſes ſtop, as after long Feavers, after great Evacuations, and when the Body is much waſted, you muſt not endeavour to provoke the Courſes, till the Body is repleniſhed, and till a ſufficient quantity of Blood is bred; which being done, they generally follow of their own accord. But if it happen that Nature forget her Office, ſhe muſt be rouſed up by opening the lower Veins, and by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines propoſed in the foregoing Chapter; but the quantity of Blood taken away muſt be moderate, leaſt the Strength ſhould be dejected, and the Sick ſhould fall into a Conſumption. But here it muſt be carefully noted, That every Waſting of the Body does not indicate a Want of Blood; but only that which ſucceeds great Evacuations, and the like; for ſometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the Courſes being ſuppreſſed, and retained in the Veins, occaſion an ill quality, whereby the Blood is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unfit to nouriſh the Parts; upon which account the Body waſts though the Veins are full of Blood, in which Caſe large Bleeding is required.</p>
                  <p>As to the Suppreſſion of the Courſes, which happens by a prepoſterous Motion of the Blood, when it is evacuated by Bleeding at the Noſe, by Vomiting, Spitting, or the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoides, and other Parts.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of it is performed by repelling the Blood from the Parts through which it flows preternaturally, and by drawing
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65404:166"/>
it back to the Paſſage of the Womb. The firſt is performed, when the Blood ruſhes out of the upper Parts, by waſhing the Arms, Head, and Face with cold water, and by forbearing the Exerciſe of thoſe Parts, eſpecially Singing, and ſpeaking aloud. The ſecond is performed by opening the inferior Veins three or four Days before the Blood breaks out, and by Cupping-glaſſes applied to the Thighs and Legs, ſometimes with, ſometimes without Scarification, by provoking the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhoids, by Frictions, Ligatures, Walking, Fomentations, Baths made of opening Herbs, Peſſaries, uterine Gliſters, and by other things to be deſcribed below. But the Bath-water is eſpecially commended, and the Sick muſt bath in them often a good while after Meals; but the Water muſt not riſe above the Hypochondres, and at the ſame time, the upper Parts muſt be cooled by fanning them.</p>
                  <p>If the Blood flow by the Hemmorrhoides, the Cure is very difficult, for if you uſe things to draw downwards, they bring the Blood alſo to the Fundament; and if you uſe aſtringent things to it, they, by reaſon of the Nearneſs of the Parts, repel what ſhould be brought to the Womb, ſo that the only Way of Cure, is to apply ſuch things to the Womb as may allure the Blood thither, after you have uſed ſuch things as draw the Blood downwards.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt frequent Obſtruction of all, is that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from an Obſtruction of the Veins of the Womb, the Cure whereof is in a manner the ſame with that of the Green Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But the Eruption of them muſt be helpt by opening a Vein in the Foot about the time they uſed to flow when the Patient was well; as alſo by Cupping-glaſſes applied to the Hips and Legs, inſtead of Bleeding with, or without Scarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, by Frictions of thoſe Parts, and by painful Ligatures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of round Birthwort half a dram, of the leaves of dried Savin one dram and an half, of Dittany of Crete, and of Troches of Mirrh, without Aſſa-Faetida, each one dram; of choice Cinnamon two drams, of white Sugar two ounces; make a Powder, whereof let her take two drams every Morning for ſome days, with the Broth of red Vetches wherein two drams of Cinnamon, and half a dram of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron have been boiled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Roots of Briony, of Lillies, Cyperus, Valerian, Angelica, Aſarabacca, Orris, and Parſley, each one ounce; of the Leaves of Mugwort, Bays, Rue, Savin, Thym, Roſemary, Penny-royal, Nep, Mallows, Mercury, each one handful; of the Flowers of Elder, of Wall-flowers, and of Camomil, each two Pugils; of the grains of Juniper two ounces; boil them in Water and Whitewine; with the ſtrained Liquor foment the Belly and Thighs with a Spunge.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves of Mercury bruiſed one handful, of the Powder of Hiera Picra, and of Benedictum Laxativum, each two drams; of the Powder of long Birthwort one dram, with a ſufficient quantity of Honey, or the Juice of Mercury; make a Peſſary</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Injections are alſo wont to be made for the Womb, which are called uterine Gliſters, for they cleanſe it from Filth ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Sides, and they open the inner Orifices of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: They may be prepared with a Decoction for the Fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation above deſcribed, the acrid things being left out, or of fat Figs with Mugwort, Penny-royal, Mercury, or only of the Juice of Mercury clarified, wherein a little Benedictum Laxativum has been diſſolved, for you muſt not uſe acrid things, leſt they ſhould occaſion an Inflammation. And after the uſe of theſe things, which muſt be retained only an hour, it is convenient to inject a Decoction of Mallows, Barley, and Violets, or a little Hydromel diluted with the Whey of Goats Milk.</p>
                  <p>When the Diſeaſe is inveterate, Iſſues in the Leg do much good.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, You muſt never uſe Remedies to force the Courſes, unleſs general Evacuations went before. Secondly, You muſt begin with gentle Means, and proceed by degrees to ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Thirdly, Medicines that are given to move the Courſes muſt be taken in a large quantity. Fourthly, Peſſaries and uterine Gliſters muſt be preſcribed only for married Women: But for Virgins Fomentations, Baths, and the following Fume may be ordered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Cloves, Cinnamon, and Mace, each two drams; of Juniper-berries half an ounce, of the Seeds of Nigella one dram, of Storax Calamit two drams; make a groſs Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which muſt be caſt upon Coals, and the Fume muſt be received through a Tunnel.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. XCVII. Of Hyſterick and Hypochondriack Diſeaſes.</head>
                  <p>THeſe Diſeaſes, if I calculate right, are the moſt frequent of all chronical Diſeaſes; and as Fevers, with thoſe Diſeaſes that appertain to them, if they are compared with chronical, taken altogether, make two thirds; ſo, Hyſterical Diſeaſes, at leaſt thoſe that go under that Name, are half the remaining third, that is, chronical Diſeaſes are half Hyſterick; for very few Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which Sex contains half of grown People, are wholly free from all kinds of Hyſterick Diſeaſes, if you except thoſe who being accuſtomed to Labour live hardly; yea, many of thoſe Men that live ſedentary Lives, and are wont to ſtudy hard, are afflicted with the ſame Diſeaſe; and though, heretofore, Hyſterical Symptoms were always reckoned to proceed from a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Womb, yet if we compare Hypochondriack Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, which were ſuppoſed to proceed from Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Spleen or Bowels, or from ſome other I know not what Obſtructions, with Women's Hyſterick Symptoms, an Egg is ſcarce more like an Egg, than theſe Symptoms are like one another in all reſpects: But it muſt be confeſſed, that Women are much more ſubject to this kind of Diſeaſe, than Men.</p>
                  <p>This Diſeaſe is not only frequent, but ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully various, that it reſembles almoſt all the Diſeaſes poor Mortals are ſubject to; for whatever Part it ſeats it ſelf in, it preſently produces ſuch Symptoms as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it; and unleſs the Phyſician be very ſagacious and very skilful, he will be miſtaken, and ſuppoſe that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſe Symptoms proceed from an eſſential Diſeaſe of this or that part, and not from an hiſterical Diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes, for inſtance, it poſſeſſes the Head, and occaſions an Apoplexy, which alſo ends in an Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gy, and this ſeizes Women very often after Delivery; or it is occaſioned by hard Labour, or ſome violent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:65404:169"/>Sometimes it produces violent Convulſions very like an Epilepſy, the Belly and Bowels ſwelling toward the Throat, the Patient ſtrugling ſo violently, that though at other times her Strength is but ordinary, ſhe now can ſcarce be held by all the ſtrength of the By-ſtanders, uttering ſome odd and inarticulat ſounds, and ſtriking her Breaſt. Women who are accuſtomed to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, commonly called Mother-fits, are generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Sanguine, and have a habit of Body almoſt like that of a Virago.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it poſſeſſes the outward part of the Head, betwixt the Pericranium and Skull, cauſing violent Pain continually fixed in one part, which may be covered with the top of your Thumb, and violent Vomiting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies this Pain: I call this Species <hi>Clavus Hyſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> chiefly afflicting thoſe that have the Green-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes falling upon the vital Parts, it occaſions ſo great a palpitation of the Heart, that the Women who are afflicted with it, may verily believe that the By-ſtanders may hear the ſound of the Heart thumping upon the Ribs. This kind chiefly afflicts thoſe that are of a thin habit of Body and of a weak Conſtitution, and who look almoſt tabid; and alſo, young Maids that have the Green-ſickneſs.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Patient coughs almoſt without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but expectorates nothing. This kind of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterick-cough is very rare, and chiefly invades Women that abound in Flegm. Sometimes ruſhing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon the Colon, and the Region under the Scrobiculum Cordis, it occaſions violent Pain, much like the Iliack Paſſion, and the Woman vomits exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, ejecting a certain green Matter ſomewhat like that they call porraceous Bile; and ſometimes Matter of an unuſual colour: And often after the Sick have been almoſt deſtroyed by the ſaid Pain, which would tire a ſtoical Apathy, and reachings to vomit for many days, at length it is carried off by the Jaundice tincturing the ſuperficies of the Body like Saffron. Moreover, the Sick is oppreſſed by an anguiſh of mind, and wholly deſpairs of recovery, with dejection of mind, and as it were a certain deſperation; as certainly accompanies
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65404:170"/>
this kind of Hyſterick Diſeaſe, as the Pain and Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting above-mentioned. This kind chiefly invades thoſe that are of a lax and crude habit of Body, and thoſe that have ſuffered much in bringing forth great Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.</p>
                  <p>When this Diſeaſe falls upon one of the Kidnies, it plainly repreſents, by the Pain it cauſes there, a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phritick Fit; and not only by that ſort of Pain, and by the place it rages in, but alſo by the violent Vomitings that accompanies it, and for that ſometimes the Pain extends it ſelf through the paſſage of the Ureter; ſo that it is very difficult to know whether theſe Symptoms proceed from the Stone, or from ſome Hyſterick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; unleſs, perchance, ſome unlucky Accident di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing the Woman's mind, a little before ſhe was taken ill of the vomiting of green Matter, ſhews that the Symptoms rather proceed from an Hyſterick Diſeaſe, than from the Stone. Nor is the Bladder free from this falſe Symptom; for it does not only cauſe Pain there, but it alſo ſtops the Urine, juſt as if there were a Stone, whereas there is none: But this laſt kind ſeizing the Bladder, happens very ſeldom. That which reſembles the Stone in the Kidnies is not ſo rare; both uſe to invade thoſe Women, who are much weak'ned by Hyſterick Fits coming frequently, and whoſe health of Body is much impaired.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes falling upon the Stomach it cauſes c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Vomiting, and ſometimes a Looſeneſs, when it is ſetled upon the Guts. But no Pain accompanies either of theſe Symptoms, though oftentimes in both the green Humours appear. Both theſe kinds are familiar with thoſe that are weak'ned by the Hyſterick Fits coming frequently.</p>
                  <p>And as this Diſeaſe afflicts almoſt all the inward Parts, ſo ſometimes it ſeizes all the outward Parts, and the muſculous Fleſh occaſioning Pain, and ſometimes a Tumour in the Jaws, Shoulders, Hands, Thighs, Legs, in which kind that Tumour which ſwells the Legs, is more conſpicuous than the reſt. But whereas in Hydropical Swellings, theſe two things may be always taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, <hi>viz.</hi> That the ſwelling is moſt in the Evening, and that the Finger preſt upon it, leaves a pit: In this
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65404:170"/>
Tumour the ſwelling is moſt in the Morning, nor does it yield to the Finger, or leave any mark behind it, and for the moſt part it only ſwells one of the Legs. As to other things, if you mind the largeneſs of it, or its ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, it is ſo very like Hydropical Swellings, that the Patient can ſcarce be brought to believe that it is any other Diſeaſe; nor can the Teeth free themſelves from the aſſaults of this Diſeaſe, tho' they are not hollow, and tho' there is no apparent defluxion that may occaſion the Pain, yet it is no whit gentler, nor ſhorter, nor eaſier cured. But theſe Pains and Tumours which afflict the outward Parts, chiefly ſeize thoſe Women that are in a manner quite deſtroyed by a long ſeries of Hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Fits, and by the force of them.</p>
                  <p>But among all the Torments of this Diſeaſe, there is none ſo common as a pain in the Back, which moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly all feel, how little ſoever they are afflicted with this Diſeaſe. Moreover, this is common to the foreſaid Pains, that the place on which they were, will not bear touching after they are gone; but is tender, and akes juſt as if it were ſoundly beaten: But this tenderneſs goes off by degrees.</p>
                  <p>And this is worth obſerving, That often a notable Cold of the external Parts makes way for theſe Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, which for the moſt part does not go off till the Fit ends; which Cold I have obſerved is almoſt like that by which a Carcaſs grows ſtiff, yet the Pulſe is good.</p>
                  <p>And moreover, all Hyſterick Women which I have hitherto taken care of, complain of a dejection and ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirits; and when they would ſhew the place where the ſinking of the Spirits is, they point to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, every one knows that Hyſterick Women ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times laugh exceſſively, and ſometimes cry as much, without any real cauſe for either.</p>
                  <p>But among all the Symptoms that accompany this Diſeaſe, this is the moſt proper, and almoſt inſeparable, <hi>viz.</hi> a Urine as clear as Rock-water, and this Hyſterick Women evacuate plentifully; which I find, by diligent Enquiry, is in almoſt all the pathognomonic ſign of this Diſeaſe, which we call Hyſterick in Women, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:65404:171"/>
in Men; and I have ſometimes obſerved in Men, that preſently after making Water of a Citron colour (yea, almoſt the next moment) being ſuddenly ſeized with ſome violent commotion of the Mind, they make Water as clear as Criſtal, and in a great quantity with a continued violent Stream, and continue ill till the Urine comes to its wonted colour, and then the Fit goes off.</p>
                  <p>And it happens to all Hyſterical and Hypochondriacal People, that ſometimes they belch up ill Fumes as often as they eat, tho' they eat only moderately, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they have an Appetite; and ſometimes the Wind that comes from the Stomach is ſower juſt like Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
                  <p>Nor are they unhappy upon this account only, <hi>viz.</hi> That their Bodies are ſo ill affected, and as it were tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering like ruined Houſes juſt about to fall; for their Minds are more diſeaſed than their Bodies, and an incure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſperation is mixed with the very nature of the Diſeaſe; and what the Roman Orator ſaid of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions exactly agrees with theſe melancholy People, <hi>Sleep,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſeems to be a Refuge to the Laborious and Careful, but from thence Cares and Fears ariſe,</hi> whilſt only Funerals and Apparitions of their deceaſed Friends are repreſented in Dreams, and they are ſo tormented in Body and Mind that one would think their Lives were a Purgatory, wherein they were to purifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to expiate Crimes committed in ſome other State. Nor does this happen only to mad People, but alſo to thoſe who, if you except thoſe Impetuoſities of Mind, are very prudent and judicious, and who much excel for deep thought and wiſdom in Speech, others, who's Minds were never excited by theſe Provokments to thinking. But this dreadful condition of Mind which we have above deſcribed, ſeizes on thoſe only that have much and a long while conflicted with this Diſeaſe, and have been at length wholly vanquiſhed by it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if Adverſity, care or trouble of Mind or hard Study, or the like, join'd with an ill habit of Body, have added Oil to the Flame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:65404:171"/>A day would ſcarce be ſufficient to reckon up all the Symptoms belonging to Hyſterick Diſeaſes, and I think <hi>Democritus</hi> reckoned pretty right (though he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook the cauſe of the Diſeaſe) when he ſaid in an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to <hi>Hippocrates, That the Womb was the cauſe of ſix hundred Miſeries, and of innumerable Calamities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The procatarctick or external cauſes of this Diſeaſe are either violent motions of the Body, or which is much oftener, vehement commotions of the Mind. But to theſe diſorders of the Mind, which are uſually the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of this Diſeaſe, is to be added emptineſs of the Stomach, by reaſon of long Faſting, immoderate Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a Vomit or Purge that works too much.</p>
                  <p>As to the internal, efficient Cauſes, in my Opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thoſe Diſeaſes which we call Hyſterick in Women, and Hypochondriack in Men, proceed from a confuſion of the Spirits. The origin and antecedent cauſe of this confuſion, is a weak conſtitution of the Spirits.</p>
                  <p>In order to the Cure, I order, That 8 ounces of Blood be taken from the right Arm, and that the following Plaſter be applied to the Navel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Galbanum, diſſolv'd in tincture of Caſtor and ſtrain'd, three drachms, of Tacamacha two drachms; mix them, make a Plaſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Morning, let her make uſe of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pills.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Pill Coch. major two ſcruples, of Caſtor powder'd two grains, of peruvian Balſam four drops; make four Pills, let her take them at five in the Morning, and ſleep after them. Repeat them twice or thrice every Morning, or every other Morning, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their operation and the ſtrength of the Patient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of black Cherries, Rue and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Briony, each three ounces; of Caſtor, tyed up in a Rag and hanged in the Glaſs, half a dram; of fine Sugar a ſufficient quanity, make a Julep, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of let her take four or five Spoonfuls when ſhe is faint, dropping into the first Doſe, if the Fit is violent, twenty drops of the Spirit of Hartſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:65404:172"/>After the Purging Pills juſt deſcribed are taken, let her uſe the following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the filings of Steel eight grains, with a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantity of extract of Wormwood; make two Pills, let her take them early in the Morning, and at five in the Afternoon, for thirty days, drinking upon them a draught of Wormwood-wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, if ſhe like a Bolus better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of conſerve of Roman-wormwood, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of the yellow rind of Oranges, each one ounce; of candied Angelica, and Nutmogs candied, and of Venice Treacle, each half an ounce; of candied Gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger two drachms; make an Electuary, with a ſufficient quantity of Syruy of Oranges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of this Electuary one drachm and an half, of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Steel well rubbed eight grains; make a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, with a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Oranges, to be taken in the Morning, and at five in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drinking upon it a Glaſs of Wormood-wine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of choice Myrrh and Galbanum, each one drachm and an half; of Caſtor fifteen grains, with a ſufficient quantity of Balſam of Peru; make twelve Pills of every drachm. Let her take three every Night, and drink upon them three or four Spoonfuls of compound Briony-water, through the whole courſe of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Pills laſt preſcribed move the Belly, which ſometimes happens in Bodies that are very eaſily purged, by reaſon of the Gum that is in them; the following may be uſed inſtead of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Caſtor one drachm, of volatil Salt of Amber half a drachm, with a ſufficient quantity of extract of Rue; make twenty four ſmall Pills: Let her take three every Night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here you muſt take notice, That Chalybeats, in whatſoever Form or Doſe they are taken, occaſion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Women great diſorders both of Body and Mind, and that not only on the firſt days, which is uſual al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every Body, but alſo all the time they are taken; in this caſe, the uſe of Steel muſt be interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at thoſe times; but Laudanum muſt be given every
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:65404:172"/>
Night for ſome time, in ſome Hyſterick Water, that they may better bear it.</p>
                  <p>But when the Symptoms are mild, and it ſeems that the buſineſs may be done without taking Steel, I think it ſufficient to bleed and to purge three or four times, and then to give the altering Hyſterick Pills before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, Morning and Evening, for ten days; which method ſeldoms fails, when the Diſeaſe is not violent; yea, the Pills alone, bleeding and purging being omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, oftentimes do a great deal of good.</p>
                  <p>Yet we muſt take great notice, That ſome Women, by a certain Ideoſyncraſy, ſo abhor Hyſterical Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines (which give eaſe in moſt of the Symptoms of this Diſeaſe) that they don't only not receive benefit, but are much injur'd thereby; therefore, they muſt not be given to ſuch; for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, <hi>'Tis in vain to do any thing contrary to Natures inclination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Ideoſyncracy is ſo great and ſo frequent, that if we have not regard to it, the Lives of the Sick may be hazarded.</p>
                  <p>And ſo Hyſterical Diſeaſes are moſt commonly cur'd and moſt Obſtructions of Women, eſpecially the Green Sickneſs; and alſo, all Suppreſſions of the Courſes. But if the Blood is ſo very feeble, and the confuſion of the Spirits ſo great, that Ste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l order'd to be us'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Method preſcrib'd, is not ſufficient to cure the Diſeaſe, the Patient muſt drink ſome mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters impregnated with an Iron Mine, ſuch as are <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and ſome others lately found out, for the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lybeat Vertue of theſe is better mingl'd with the Blood, by reaſon of the great quantity that is taken of them, and alſo becauſe they are more agreeable to Nature, and they cure Diſeaſes more effectually than Iron how much ſoever exalted by Art.</p>
                  <p>But this is more eſpecially to be obſerv'd, in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, that if any Sickneſs happens that is to be referr'd to Hyſterical Symptoms, in this caſe the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent muſt forbear drinking them a day or two, till that Symptom that hinder'd their Paſſage is quite gone; and it is to be noted, that Purging muſt be avoided all the time the Patient drinks theſe Waters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:65404:173"/>But if this Diſeaſe, by reaſon of its Obſtinacy does not yield to Steel-waters, the Sick muſt go to the Bath, and when ſhe has uſed them inwardly three mornings following, the next day let her go into the Bath, and the day following let her drink them again, and ſo let her do by turns for two months; for in theſe and in others, of what kind ſoever they are, this muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully noted, That the Patient muſt perſiſt in the uſe of them, not only till ſhe perceives ſome benefit, but till ſhe is quite well, that the Symptoms may not return again in a ſhort time. <hi>Venice</hi>-Treacle alone if it is us'd often and a long while, is a great Remedy in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe; and not only in this but in very many other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, that proceed from want of heat, or concoction or digeſtion, 'tis perhaps the moſt powerful that has been hitherto known. Spaniſh Wine medicated with <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Angelica, Wormwood, Centory</hi> and other Corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives infus'd in it, does a great deal of good, ſome Spoonfuls of it being taken thrice a day, if the Woman be not of a thin and cholerick habit of Body; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a large Draught of Spaniſh Wine by it ſelf taken at Bed-time for ſome Nights, by my Advice, has been very beneficial to ſome Women; for by it the habit of the whole Body was render'd ſtronger, and they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were Cachectical, became freſh-colour'd and brisk.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, ſometimes we find that the Peruvian Bark wonderfully comforts and invigorates the Blood and Spirits, a Scruple of it being taken Morning and Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome Weeks; but it ſucceeds beſt in that kind of Hyſterick Diſeaſes, wherein VVomen are afflicted with Convulſions. But if any of the Remedies above-mentioned don't agree well, which often happens in cholerick and thin Conſtitutions, then a Milk-diet may be us'd, for ſome VVomen (which one wou'd wonder at at firſt) that have been conflicted a long while with Hyſterick Diſeaſes, and even ſuch as have fruſtrated all the endeavours of Phyſicians, yet have recover'd by dieting themſelves for ſome time only with Milk; and eſpecially thoſe that labour with that Diſeaſe, I call an Hyſterick Cholick; which can't be appeas'd by any thing but Narcoticks, to which, repeated by Intervals,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65404:173"/>
the VVomen are much accuſtom'd, the Pain returning aſſoon as the Vertue of the Anodyne fades.</p>
                  <p>But nothing of all I have hitherto mention'd does ſo much comfort and ſtrengthen the Blood and Spirits as riding on Horſe-back every Day for a long while, but though it may be inconvenient for Women that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to a ſlothful and delicate way of living, for they may be injur'd by Motion, eſpecially at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet 'tis very proper for Men, and ſooneſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers their Health. One of our Right Reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, famous for Prudence and Learning, having ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died too hard a long while, fell at length into an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriac Diſeaſe, which afflicting him a long Time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vitiated all the Ferments of the Body, and wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Concoctions; he had paſſed through long Courſes of Steel more than once, and had tried almoſt all mineral Waters, with Purging often repeated, and antiſcorbuticks of all kinds, and very many teſtaceous Powders, which are reckoned proper to ſweeten the Blood, and ſo being in a manner quite worn out, partly by the Diſeaſe, and partly by Phyſick, uſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually for ſo many Years, he was at length ſeized with a colliquative Looſneſs, which is wont to be the forerunner of Death in Conſumptions, and other chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes, when the Digeſtions are wholly deſtroy'd. At length he adviſed with me; I preſently conſidered that there was no more room for Medicine, he having taken ſo many already without any Relief; for which reaſon I perſuaded him to ride on Horſe-back, and that firſt he ſhould take ſuch a ſmall Journey as was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his weak condition. Had he not been a very judicious Man, and one that weighed things well, he would not have been perſuaded ſo much as to have tryed ſuch a kind of Exerciſe: I intreated him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in it daily, till in his own Opinion he was well, going daily furthur and further, till at length he went ſo many miles in a Day as prudent and moderate Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, that go a long Journey upon Buſineſs, uſe to do, without any regard to Meat, Drink or the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But that he ſhould take every thing as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened: To be ſhort, he continued this Method, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing his Journies by degrees, till at length he rode
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65404:174"/>
twenty or thirty miles daily; and when he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much better in few Days, being encouraged with ſuch wonderful Succeſs, he continued this courſe a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty many Months; in which Time, as he told me, he rode many thouſand Miles, till at length he did not only recover, but alſo gained a ſtrong and brisk habit of Body.</p>
                  <p>This is the general way of Curing this Diſeaſe, which is applied to the original Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the weak Craſis of the Blood, and ſo is to be uſed only when the fit is off: Therefore as often as the Fit invades, joined with any one of the foreſaid Symptoms, if the Diſeaſe be ſuch, or ſo great an one, that it will not bear a Truce, till it may be cured by Medicines that corroborate the Blood and Spirits, we muſt preſently make uſe of hyſterick Remedies, which by their ſtrong and offenſive Smell recal the exorbitant and deſerting Spirits to their proper Stations, whether they are taken inwardly, or ſmell'd to, or outwardly applied: Such are <hi>Aſſa Foetida, Galbanum, Caſtor, Spirit of Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi> and laſtly, whatever has a very ungrateful and offenſive ſmell.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, you muſt take notice, that if ſome intollerable Pain accompanies the Fit, in whatever part it is; or violent Vomiting or a Looſneſs, than beſides the Hyſtericks above-mentioned, <hi>Laudanum</hi> muſt be uſed, which only is able to reſtrain theſe Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms.</p>
                  <p>But in quieting the Pains, which Vomiting occaſions, we muſt take great care that they are not mitigated either by <hi>Laudanum,</hi> or any other Paregorick, before due Evacuations have been made, unleſs they almoſt exceed all human Patience. Firſt, becauſe ſometimes there is ſo great a quantity of Blood and Humours heap'd up (eſpecially in ſanguine Women, and in Men of a proper Habit) that is able to withſtand the Operation of the moſt effectual Narcotick, though it be often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore in ſuch Blood muſt neceſſarily be evacuated from the Veins of the Arm, and a Purge muſt be given before we come to uſe <hi>Laudanum</hi>; for when theſe things are duly performed, that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given in a large Doſe would do no good, does now
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65404:174"/>
perform the Buſineſs in a moderate Doſe; and then becauſe I have found by frequent Experience, that when the Sick has been accuſtomed by little and little to <hi>Laudanum,</hi> and has not been duly evacuated before ſhe was forced, by reaſon of the return of the Pain preſently after the Vertue of the Medicine vaniſhed, to take a Paregorick again, and ſo daily for ſome Years, the Doſe being ſometimes by degrees increaſed, ſo that at laſt they can by no means abſtain from <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum,</hi> though thereby all the Digeſtions are vitiated, and the natural Functions weakned; though I do not think that the uſe of <hi>Laudanum</hi> does immediately hurt the Brain, or Nerves, or the animal Faculties: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I judge and ſpeak what I have found, That Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation ought to go before Anodynes, <hi>viz.</hi> in Virago's, and in Women that abound with Blood, a Vein muſt be opened, and the Body purged, eſpecially if they have been lately ſeized with the Fit: But if weak Women, and thoſe of a quite contrary Conſtitution, labour with ſuch a Fit and Pain, and have been not long ago afflicted with it, it will be ſufficient to cleanſe their Stomachs with a gallon of Poſſet-drink, more or leſs, taken in and ejected by Vomit, and then to give a large Doſe of <hi>Venice Treacle</hi> and a few Spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of ſome Spirituous Liquor, that is pleaſing to the taſte, with a few Drops of <hi>Liquid Laudanum</hi> to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken preſently after it.</p>
                  <p>But if the Sick has vomited a great while before the Phyſician was called, and there is danger, leſt by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provocation, by Emeticks, the Spirits ſhould be put in a rage, and the Sick too much weakned: In this caſe you muſt give <hi>Laudanum</hi> without delay, and ſuch a Doſe that is not only ſuitable to the Violence and Duration of the Symptom, but ſuch an one as is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to vanquiſh it.</p>
                  <p>But here two things are to be chiefly noted; Firſt That when you have once begun to uſe <hi>Laudanum</hi> after due and neceſſary Evacuations, it muſt be taken in that Doſe, and often repeated till the Symptom is quite conquered; only ſuch a ſpace muſt be betwixt each Doſe, that we may know what the former has done before we give another: And then when we treat the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65404:175"/>
Diſeaſe with <hi>Laudanum,</hi> we muſt do nothing elſe, and nothing muſt be evacuated, for the gentleſt Gliſter of Milk and Sugar is ſufficient to ſpoil whatever has been repaired by the Paregoric, and to occaſion the return of the Vomiting and Pain. But though the Pains above-mentioned, as we have ſaid, are apt to overcome the Vertue of the Anodyne, yet violent Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting indicates the largeſt Doſe of it, and that it ſhould be very often repeated; for by the inverted periſtaltick Motion of the Stomach (by which that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it ought to be carried downwards) the Pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorick is ejected through the Oeſophagus, before it can do any good, unleſs after every time the Sick vomits the Narcotick be given afreſh, and chiefly in a ſolid form, or if it be given in a Liquor the Vehicle muſt be ſo ſmall, as that it muſt but juſt wet the Stomach, ſo that by reaſon of the ſmall quantity of the Matter it cannot be caſt up. For inſtance, ſome Drops of <hi>liquid Laudanum</hi> in one ſpoonful of ſtrong <hi>Cinnamon-Water,</hi> or the like; and the Sick muſt be admoniſhed to keep her ſelf quiet, preſently after taking the <hi>Laudanum,</hi> and that ſhe keep her Head, as much as poſſible, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, for the ſmalleſt motion of the Head pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes Vomiting more than any thing elſe, and then the Medicine, juſt taken, is ejected; and when the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting ceaſes, and is, as it were, tamed, it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to give an Anodyne morning and evening for a few days, to prevent a Relapſe, which alſo ought to be obſerved after a looſneſs, or an hyſterick Pain taken off by a Narcotick; and ſo at length by this method we may readily cure the ſymptomatick Pain and Vomiting, whereby, becauſe they are very often like other Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Phyſicians are eaſier impoſed upon than by any other Symptoms whatever.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XCVIII. Of an Inflammation in the Womb.</head>
                  <p>AN Inflammation of the Womb is a Swelling of that Part, from Blood poured upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Inflammation either poſſeſſes all the Womb, or a part of it; and it is occaſioned either by pure Blood, and then it is called ſimply a Phlegmon, or it is mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Choler, or with Flegm or Melancholy.</p>
                  <p>The diagnoſtick Signs are a Swelling, Heat and Pain in the region of the Womb, with a continual Fever. But becauſe the right-Gut and the Bladder poſſeſs the ſame region, therefore an Inflammation of the Womb muſt be diſtinguiſhed by other Signs, as by a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or Diminution of the Courſes, the pale or yellow Colour of them, and by the Pain in Evacuation of them, and when the Courſes are gon off, by a fetid Itchor that moiſtens the Privities, the inward Mouth of it will appear ſwell'd, drawn back and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and the Neck will be red and inflamed.</p>
                  <p>If all the Womb be inflamed, all the Symptoms will be more violent; if the Inflammation be moſt upon the Neck of the Womb, the Heat and Pain will be extended moſt to the Croins and Privities. If the forepart be moſt afflicted, the Bladder will moſt ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſe: If the hinder part be moſt afflicted, the right Gut will moſt ſympathiſe, and the Pain will ſtretch it ſelf to the Loins: If the right part or the left part be inflamed, the Swelling and Pain will appear about ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Groin, and the Leg of the ſame Side will have a Weight upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Signs of the Cauſes are to be known in the following manner: If the Inflammation be occaſioned by pure Blood, all the Symptoms will be gentle; but if Choler be mixed with it, the Fever will be high, and all the Symptoms violent; but if the Blood be flegmatic or melancholy, the Fever is not ſo acute, but more laſting and obſtinate: Alſo the Signs of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:65404:176"/>
predominating in the Body are to be referred to the Diagnoſtick.</p>
                  <p>If the Inflammation tends to ſuppuration, the Pain and Fever increaſes, and there are Shiverings which come moſt commonly about Evening, and all the reſt of the Symptoms are increaſed. When Suppuration is made they all abate, but the Tumor is more increaſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Belly, and ſometimes the Urine are ſuppreſſed. But if the Inflammation is diſcuſſed without Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Tumor is leſſened, and the Symptoms abate.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If it degenerate into a Scirrhus, the Fever and Pain, and the reſt of the Symptoms leſſen, but the Swelling grows hard, and a weight remains, not only in the Womb but alſo in the circumjacent Parts; ſo that the Sick moves difficultly.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick, this Diſeaſe is very dangerous, and moſt commonly deadly, for the Inflammation eaſily turns to a Gangrene.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure of this Diſeaſe, Revulſion and Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation muſt be made of the Flux of Blood to the Womb.</p>
                  <p>And it muſt be repelled from thence, and that which has flow'd to the part muſt be reſolved, and if the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor tends to ſuppuration, it muſt be furthered, and the Abſceſs being broken, the Matter muſt be evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which may be done by the following Remedies.</p>
                  <p>An emollient and cooling Gliſter being firſt given, the Sick muſt be blooded in the Arm; and it muſt be repeated twice, thrice or four times, according to the ſtrength of the Patient, and the greatneſs of the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                  <p>After ſufficient revulſion, and the increaſe of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe being over, and when there is no more fear of the fluxion, the lower Veins muſt be opened for derivation from the Part affected. But as long as there is any Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for revulſion, it is ſafeſt to open the Veins of the Arm.</p>
                  <p>And for revulſion, Frictions and Ligatures of the upper Parts are proper, and Cupping-glaſſes applied to the Shoulders, Back and Loins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:65404:176"/>If vitious Humours, eſpecially Cholerick, abound in the Body, which are, as it were, a Vehicle for other Humours in the Flux, they are to be evacuated by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Medicines; as with Syrup of Roſes, Manna and Rhubarb, or with lenitive Electuary. By reaſon of the Fever, cooling Medicines are to be uſed; as Juleps and Emulſions; if there be great Watching, Pain or Reſtleſneſs, Narcoticks may be mingled with them, or they may be given apart.</p>
                  <p>After the firſt evacuation Topicks may be applied to the Belly, betwixt the Navel and the Pubes, or about the Reins; firſt, things that cool and repel in the form of a Liniment, Epithem or Cataplaſm.</p>
                  <p>A Liniment may be made of Oyl of Roſes waſh'd in Vineger, or with Ointment of Roſes.</p>
                  <p>An Epithem may be made of Waters, or of a Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Plantain, Sorrel, Night-ſhade, of the tops of white Poppies and of Roſes, adding to them a little Bole-armenick, Dragon's-blood, or ſealed Earth.</p>
                  <p>A Cataplaſm may be made of Crums of Bread boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Milk, to which may be added a little Oil of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Juice of Henbane or of Night-ſhade, with the yolks of Eggs, or of the Meal of Barly; of the Seeds of Flax or of Fenugreek, with Oil of Roſes; to which alſo may be added, the Plants above-mentioned bruiſed.</p>
                  <p>Injections may be made for the Womb, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the leaves of Plantain, Water-lillies, Night-ſhade and Endive, each one handful; of red Roſes, two pugils: Boyl them till a third is conſumed, and add to them one ounce of Oyl of Mirtles, and half an ounce of Vineger; make an Injection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Peſſaries for the Womb may be made of the ſame Herbs bruiſed, and with Oyl of Roſes and Vineger.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt not uſe repelling and cooling things too long, leſt the Tumor grow hard, and turn to a Scirrhus; therefore, things that mollify and diſſolve, muſt be mixed with Repellents, with this caution, <hi>viz.</hi> That the farther the Inflammation is from the beginning, the greater muſt be the quantity of the things that digeſt: To the fore-mentioned Remedies may be added, Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:65404:177"/>
Marſh-mallows, Mugwort, Fenugreek, Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile and Melilot; the quantity of them being increaſed or diminiſhed as there ſeems occaſion. In the mean time if the Belly be hard, it muſt be looſened by things that purge gently; and cooling Gliſters frequently inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, do much good in qualifying the Inflammation, the Womb lying upon the right Gut. But the quantity of them muſt be very ſmall, that they may be the longer retained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſh-mallows one ounce, of the leaves of Mallows, Violets and Lettice, each one handful, of Night-ſhade half an handful, of the flowers of Violets and red Roſes, each one pugil, of acid Prunes number ten; boyl them in Barly-water; to ſix ounces of the ſtrained Liquor, add three ounces of Oyl of Roſes; make a Gliſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the pain be very violent, to the foreſaid Gliſter may be added yolks of Eggs, Hens greaſe, Woman's milk, the mucilages of the Seeds of Fenugreek, Flax o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Mallows, and a little Opium, and a little Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron.</p>
                  <p>Injections may be alſo made for the Womb, of Goats or Sheeps milk with Opium or Saffron, each Grains three or four, with a little Roſe-water.</p>
                  <p>Or to the Peſſaries, may be added a moderate quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Opium with a little Saffron, yolks of Eggs, and Oyl of Roſes; or Peſſaries may be made of <hi>Philonium Romanum</hi> with Cotton, or an anodyne Fomentation may be prepared in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Marſh-mallows with the roots, of Mallows and Violets, each one handful; of Camomile, Melilot and Roſes, each one pugil; boil them for a fomenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Diſeaſe decreaſing, Purging muſt be repeated with gentle Catharticks; but if it tend to reſolution, which may be known by a remiſſion of the Symptoms, and by a leſſer weight in the part, Diſcutients muſt be added in larger a quantity to the foreſaid Remedies; or make the following Cataplaſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Powder of the roots of Marſh-mallows one ounce, of the flowers of Melilot and Camomile, each two drachms, of the leaves of Mugwort powder'd, of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:65404:177"/>
the Meal of Barly and Beans, each half an ounce; boil them a little in rough Wine, add to them of freſh Lard, of the Oils of Camomile and of white Lillies, each one ounce; make a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A diſſolving fomentation or bath is here alſo of uſe.</p>
                  <p>If the Tumor cannot be diſſolved, but tends to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, it muſt be furthered by the following Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the powder of the roots of Marſh-mallows, of the flowers of Camomile and Melilot, of the Meal of Linſeeds, Fenugreek-ſeeds, each one ounce, of fat Figs number eight; boil them to the conſiſtence of a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm; then add of the yolks of Eggs number four, of Saffron ten grains, of Oil of Lillies and freſh But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> each one ounce; make a Cataplaſm.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Therefore, the cauſes of it are an Abſceſs broken, acrid Humours flowing to the Womb, acrid and corr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Medicines injected, or taken inwardly, as Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides.</p>
                  <p>The antecedent cauſes are all thoſe things that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion an Inflammation, as hard Labour, violent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable Copulation, acrid and long Whites, Wounds, Falls, Contuſions; but eſpecially a virulent Gonorrhaea, and the French Pox, the Contagion whereof is eaſily communicated to the Womb, and the neck of it.</p>
                  <p>The differences are to be ſought for from the Place, Magnitude, Figure and Complication with other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The diagnoſtick Signs are a Pain and Gnawing, and the evacuation of purulent Matter.</p>
                  <p>The cure of the Ulcer muſt be performed by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the defluxion of acrid Humours, and by cleanſing and conglutinating the Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, if the Body be Plethorick, or if the Ulcer be accompanied with an Inflammation, a Vein muſt be opened in the Arm, and bleeding muſt be repeated as often as there is danger of a new fluxion, eſpecially at the time of the Courſes, to leſſen them, which are wont to increaſe the matter of the Ulcer, and to promote the flux of other Humours to the Womb.</p>
                  <p>Purging is alſo very neceſſary to cleanſe the Body from ill Humours; but it ought to conſiſt of gentle Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, as of Sena, Rhubarb, Tamarinds, Myrabolanes, and the like, which muſt be often repeated, that the vitious Humours may be diverted; and this is of ſo great moment, that <hi>Foreſtus</hi> ſays, That a noble Matron was cured of an Ulcer of the Womb, by taking every fourth day five ounces of the decoction of Sena, Dodder of Thym, red Roſes, Indian Myrabolanes ſweetned with Sugar, and by injecting a cleanſing decoction into the Womb.</p>
                  <p>For common uſe, a magiſterial Syrup may be made in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the roots of Comfry, and of freſh Polypody of the Oak, each one ounce; of the Bark of dried Citron ſix drachms; of the leaves of Plantain, Periwinkle, Sanicle, Sorrel and Maiden-hair, each one handful; of Liquoriſh raſped, and of Raiſins of the Sun ſtoned, each one ounce; of Sena cleanſed ſix drachms; of the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65404:178"/>
ſeeds of Baſtard-ſaffron bruiſed, two ounces; of Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick freſh trochiſcated, and tyed up in a Rag, ten drachms; of the ſeeds of Aniſe and Melon, each three drachms; of the Cordial Flowers of Roſemary and of Dodder, each one pugil; make a decoction of all, in a part of which infuſe half an ounce of choice Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, and one drachm of Cinnamon; in a pint and an half of the ſtrained Liquor, diſſolve three ounces of Syrup of Roſes ſolutive, and a ſufficient quantity of Sugar; boil them well and make a Syrup, whereof let her take two or three ounces twice or thrice in a month, with a decoction of Agrimony and Plantain, or with an infuſion of Rhubarb in Endive wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the ſick vomits eaſily, a Vomit is moſt uſeful, for it makes a revulſion of the Humours from the Womb; and the days the ſick does not purge a vulnerary deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction muſt be uſed a long while, made in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the leaves of Agrimony, Knot-graſs, Burnet and Plantain, each half a handful; of the roots of China three drachms, of Coriander-ſeed one drachm, of Raiſins half an ounce, of red Sanders one ſcruple; boil them in Chicken Broath, ſtrain it. Let the ſick take of it morning and evening.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the leaves of Mugwort, Plantain, Yarrow, each one handful; Rhaponticum half an ounce, of the ſeeds of Nettles one drachm; boil them in a meaſure of white Wine, and ſweeten it with Sugar; let the ſick take two or three ounces in a morning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Fever be violent, and if a great quantity of Sanies be evacuated, Whey is very proper; half a pint or more being taken in a morning, with a little Hony of Roſes.</p>
                  <p>If the Body begin to waſte, and there is a hectick Fever, Aſſes Milk muſt be taken, with Sugar of Roſes for a whole Month.</p>
                  <p>Sudorificks, there being no Inflammation, or a hot In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies may alſo do good to dry the Ulcer, and to drive the ſerous Humours towards the habit of the Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:65404:179"/>Turpentine waſhed in ſome proper Water for the Womb, as in Mugwort or Feferfew-water, or in ſome Water proper for the Ulcer, as Plantain or Roſe-water, taken with Sugar of Roſes, by Intervals cleanſes and heals the Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>Pills of Bdellium taken daily or every other day, are alſo very good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Bdellium three drachms, of Myrrh and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kincenſe, each one drachm; of Sarcocoll, Amber, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax, and of Myrabolanes, called Chebule, each one drachm; of red Coral two ſcruples, with ſyrup of Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, make a maſs for Pills; to which, when the Pain is violent, may be added a little Opium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Troches of Alkakengi with Opium, may be alſo uſed when the pain is violent; and to eaſe the pain, the ſame Remedies may be preſcribed, which were propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in an Inflammation of the Womb, for the ſame Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom.</p>
                  <p>The following Powder is alſo very effectual to dry the Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Acacia and Hypociſtis, each one drachm, of Dragon's-blood, white Starch, the roots of Plantain and of round Birthwort, each half a drachm; of Bole armenick one drachm, of Maſtich and Sarcocol, each half a drachm; make a fine Powder; the doſe is one drachm in Plantain or Roſe-water, or in ſome Chalybeat-water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To cleanſe, dry and heal the Ulcer, various Injections are prepared; but they muſt not be uſed till the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is taken off, and till the Pain is eaſed; and, therefore, upon account of the Inflammation and Acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Emulſions of the cold Seeds, the Whey of Goat's-milk, or the Milk it ſelf, or mixed with the juice of Plantain or Shepherd's purſe, may be injected firſt; if neceſſity requires, a decoction of Poppy-heads and tops of Mallows may be injected. Some Practitioners ſay, The Sick may be much relieved by injecting frequently warm Water.</p>
                  <p>The hot Intemperies, and the Pain being quieted, or at leaſt diminiſhed, we muſt uſe ſuch things as cleanſe, beginning with the gentle, and proceeding by degrees to the ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:65404:179"/>The gentle, are Whey with Sugar, a decoction of Barly with Sugar, or Hony of Roſes; but ſimple Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromel cleanſes more.</p>
                  <p>A decoction will be a little ſtronger made with Barly, Lentils, Beans not excorticated, of the Leaves of Smallage, Plantain and Pellitory, a little Hony of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes being added.</p>
                  <p>When the Ulcer is very ſordid, the following deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the roots of Gentian, Rhaponticum, Zedoary, and round Birthwort, each one ounce, of white Wine three pints; boil them to the conſumption of a third part; in the ſtrained Liquor, diſſolve half a pound of Sugar, and keep it for uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Ulcer be very fetid, a little <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguentum Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacum</hi> may be added to the decoction.</p>
                  <p>When the Ulcer is well cleanſed, we muſt uſe ſuch things as dry and conſolidat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the roots of Comfry and Biſtort, each one ounce, of the leaves of Plantain, Horſetail, Shepherd's-purſe, Sanicle, Mouſe-ear, Milfoil, each one handful, of red Roſes half an handful; boil them in a meaſure of Water for an injection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following Sarcotick Powder may be added to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the roots of Orris, Birthwort and Comfry, each half an ounce, of Myrrh one ounce, of Aloes three drachms; make a Powder, whereof let half an ounce be mingled with every injection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Turpentine waſhed in Plantain-water, two drachms, diſſolve it with Hony and the yolk of an Egg, and mingle it with the Injection. This is very effectual; but is more ſo, if the ſarcotick Powder be alſo added.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oil of the yolks of Eggs ſtirred well about in a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Mortar, is alſo very good.</p>
                  <p>Fumes muſt be uſed for deep Ulcers, for they pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate to the bottom of the Womb, and dry the Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Frankincenſe, Myrrh, Maſtick, Gum-juniper, Labdanum, each one ounce, with a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Turpentine; make Troches for a Fume.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="380" facs="tcp:65404:180"/>When the Ulcer is very obſtinat, Cinnabar muſt be added, which is of excellent uſe.</p>
                  <p>The Bath-waters have cured Women, when all other Medicines have been ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>Plaſters may be alſo conveniently applied to the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſter. If the Ulcer be in the Neck of the Womb, it muſt be anointed with Liniments, that cleanſe and dry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the juice of Smallage two ounces, of hony of Roſes one ounce and an half, of Turpentine half an ounce, of the meal of Barly or of Orobus, a ſufficient quantity; make a Liniment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oyntment of Diapompholigos may be alſo applied, adding to it Frankincenſe, Maſtich, Myrrh, Aloes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the condition of the Ulcer: Theſe things cleanſe.</p>
                  <p>After you have ſufficiently cleanſed the Ulcer, you muſt apply a drying and cicatrizing Ointment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Tutty waſhed half an ounce, of Lytharge, Ceruſs and Sarcocoll, each two drachms, of Oil and Wax a ſufficient quantity; make an Ointment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Ulcer penetrates the right Gut, and ſometimes the Bladder, which may be known by the Matter evacuated by thoſe Parts.</p>
                  <p>If it flow by the right Gut, lenitive, cleanſing and drying Gliſters muſt be injected: But if it flow from the Bladder, gentle and cooling Diureticks muſt be uſed, as an Emulſion of the greater cold Seeds, Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and other Remedies preſcribed for an Ulcer of the Bladder.</p>
                  <p>If the Ulcer turn to a Fiſtula, which chiefly happens, when it is opened outwardly towards the Hip, though it may happen in the Womb it ſelf, or in the Neck of it; in this caſe we muſt conſider, whether it be beſt to leave the accuſtomed Paſſage untouched, through which Nature endeavours to evacuate various Excrements, or to undertake the Cure of it: But if that be thought moſt proper for the Sick, a Cure that is called palliative muſt be inſtituted by Purges frequently repeated, and by ſweating twice a year, and by cleanſing and ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gthening Injections, and by applying over a Plaſter of Diapalma, or the like. But if there be any hopes of a
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65404:180"/>
Cure, the ſame Remedies muſt be uſed which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for other Fiſtula's.</p>
                  <p>If the Ulcer be occaſioned by the French Pox, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cured without an univerſal Cure; in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, the Fumes of Cinnabar received through a Tunnel into the Womb, are peculiarly proper; alſo, the anointing the inner Parts of the Womb with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Ointment.</p>
                  <p>In all Ulcers of the Womb, if there be a troubleſome itching about the Neck, as it frequently happens, by reaſon of a defluction of an acrid and ſalt Humour to the part; a Peſſary muſt be made to qualifie it, dipt in the Ointment of Elecampane with Mercury, or in Aegyptiacum diſſolved in Sea or Alum-water, or in freſh Butter, wherein quick Silver has been extinguiſhed; to which muſt be added Sulphur.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. C. Of the Scirrhus of the Womb.</head>
                  <p>THE ſigns of a Scirrhus in the Womb are a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the region of it, a ſenſe of weight in the part, eſpecially when the Sick ſtands, but there is no Fever or Pain, whereby it is diſtinguiſh'd from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, and if there be any Pain it is ſmall. If it be in the body of the Womb it is eaſily known by feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the region of the Pubes, but if it be in the Neck of the Womb it may be touch'd with the Finger; it is diſtinguiſh'd from a Mola by the preceding Cauſes, alſo becauſe in a Mola the Courſes, if they flow, flow diſorderly: But in a Scirrhus, if they flow, they keep their order. Alſo in a Mola, the Breaſts are full of Milk, but in a Scirrhus they grow ſmall.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick, every Scirrhus is difficultly cur'd; for great hardneſs once contracted can ſcarce be mollified: Moreover the Natural Heat in the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the Scirrhus is very weak, ſo that it can ſcarce diſcuſs the groſs and almoſt ſtony Matter.</p>
                  <p>A great and obſtinate Scirrhus occaſions at length a Dropſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="382" facs="tcp:65404:181"/>If a Scirrhus of the Womb be treated with too hot, and too moiſtening Remedies, it degenerates into a Cancer.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is to be directed to two things, <hi>viz.</hi> to the antecedent and conjunct cauſe.</p>
                  <p>By reaſon of the antecedent Cauſe, Bleeding muſt be ordered firſt in the Arm; if the Diſeaſe be not very inveterate: But afterwards in the inferior Veins, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Courſes are ſtopt.</p>
                  <p>The opening of the Hemorrhoidal Veins is alſo very proper, for they evacuate feculent Blood, and draw from the Womb, by reaſon of the Communication which they have with it.</p>
                  <p>Purging is alſo neceſſary, and it muſt be repeated by intervals. The Purges muſt be made of ſuch things as evacuate Melancholy. Firſt you muſt uſe ſuch as are gentle, afterwards ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>But opening Medicines, and ſuch as prepare the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Humor muſt be given before Purges, in the Forms of Apozems, Juleps or Broaths, according to the Diſpoſition of the Sick.</p>
                  <p>But beſides common Apperitives, chalybeat Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines muſt be alſo uſed, whereby the great Obſtruction in the Womb and other Parts may be diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>And that the ſuperfluous Humors may be diverted, Iſſues ſhould be made in the Legs, and muſt be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there till the Courſes, which are generally ſtopt in this Diſeaſe, return orderly.</p>
                  <p>For the conjunct Cauſe emollient and reſolving Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines muſt be applied outwardly in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Marſhmallows, and of Lillies, each two ounces; of the Leaves of Mallows, Violets, Marſhmallows, and Bears-breach, each one handful; of the Leaves of Mugword and Calamint, half an handful; of the Seeds of Flax and Fenugreek, each one ounce; of the Flowers of Camomile and Melilot, each one pugil: Make a Decoction, wherewith fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Region of the Pubes and Groin with a Spunge dipt in it and preſſed out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To mollifie more, a Decoction may be made of the Entrails of a Sheep, and the Roots of Briony and wild
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:65404:181"/>
Cucumber may be added: But you muſt begin with things that are gentle, and proceed by degrees to ſtronger</p>
                  <p>Of the ſame Decoction, the Doſe of the Simples being increaſed, a Bath may be made, which is very effectual in this caſe, and more powerful than the Fomentation.</p>
                  <p>Gliſters alſo and Injections may be made of the ſame Decoction, and frequently uſed; whereunto may be added the Oils of <hi>Lillies, Camomil</hi> and <hi>Sweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Oils of Lillies, and of Sweet Almonds, each three ounces; of the Mucilage of the Seeds of Fenugreek, extracted with White-Wine one ounce; of the Fats of Hens, Geeſe and Ducks, each one ounce and an half; of freſh Butter and of Lard, of each two ounces; with a ſufficient quantity of Wax and Turpentine make an Ointment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following is approved of in all Scirrhus's.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Bdellium, Ammoniacum, and Galbanum, each equal parts; beat them in a Mortar with Oil of Ben and Lillies; then add of the Mucilages of the Seeds of Fenugreek, Flax, and of Figs a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; make an Ointment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the ſame Matter, Wax being added, an effectual Plaſter may be made, and applied to the region of the Womb behind and before; or Diachylon with Orris may be applied. A Cataplaſm may be made of the reſidue of the Decoction for the foreſaid Bath, bruiſed and pulped, adding to it of the Meal of Fenugreek and Flax-Seeds, each one ounce, of Figs, number ſix, of the Powder of Orris Root two drachms, of Saffron half a drachm, of hens Fat and Oil of Sweet Almonds, each a ſufficient quantity; make a Cataplaſm.</p>
                  <p>The Mud of a Sulphurous Bath may be applied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Cataplaſm.</p>
                  <p>But theſe Medicines muſt be uſed with great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſt the Scirrhus ſhould be hardned; or what is much worſe, ſhould degenerate into a Cancer. So that it is beſt to deſiſt by intervals; and it is to no purpoſe to uſe Medicines when the Scirrhus is without Pain, and of a ſtony nature.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CI. Of a Cancer of the Womb.</head>
                  <p>A Cancer of the Womb is a hard Swelling of the Body or Neck of it, with pricking and lance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pain.</p>
                  <p>It is occaſioned by black Choler collected in that part, or by a Scirrhus ill cured, which eaſily degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into a Cancer in that part, eſpecially by reaſon of a great afflux of Blood, which being retained in the Veins near the Scirrhus, and not ſufficiently evacuated by the Courſes, acquires a malignant quality.</p>
                  <p>It is twofold, either ulcerated or not ulcerated.</p>
                  <p>As long as the Morbific Matter is of leſſer Acrimony and Malignity the Cancer does not break; but when the Matter becomes more acrid, it cauſes an Ulcer.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſily known by what has been ſaid; for if there be a hard Tumor in the Body or Neck of the Womb, which occaſions a pricking and lancing Pain, you may pronounce it cancerous: But it is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſtinguiſhed, if it be ſeen by the Eyes, as when it is in the Neck of the Womb, by the help of a <hi>Speculum Matricis,</hi> for then an unequal, livid, or black Tumor, encompaſſed with Branches of Veins will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: But if it be ulcerated it caſts forth a yellow or black Sanies that ſtinks much, and ſometimes Blood, by reaſon the Veins are corroded which run to it, ſo that ſometimes when a large Veſſel is opened, it flows ſo much that the Life of the Sick is hazarded. There is alſo a ſmall Fever, Anxiety, Nauſeouſneſs, and a Heat of the Privities, and the like.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick, a Cancer is incurable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ulcerated or not; wherefore ſeeing a perfect Cure cannot be expected, we muſt endeavour to hinder the breaking of it, and the increaſe of it when it is broken, and in both we muſt qualifie the Violence of the Pain; which may be done by ſuch things as evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the whole Body, and by other Remedies which alter
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:65404:182"/>
and evacuate the melancholy Humor, and black Choler, and hinder their Growth: As by bleeding in the Arm, Hemorrhoids, Foot, Potions, Apozems, Juleps, Broath, Milk, Whey, cold mineral Waters, and the like, which are commonly preſcribed for any Cancer: But Purging, moſt eſpecially muſt be repeated, that the antecedent Cauſe of the Cancer may be diverted.</p>
                  <p>Topicks muſt alſo be applied, which moderately bind and cool without Sharpneſs; they muſt eſpecially be uſed in form of Liniments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oyl of Myrtles, and of Roſes, each two ounces; of the Juice of Night-ſhade, and of Houſleek, each one ounce; ſtir them all about in a leaden Mortar, with a leaden Peſtle, till they grow black; then add of Litharge, and Cerus waſhed in Scabious Water, each three ounces; of Tutty prepared two drachms, of Camphor ten grains; make a Liniment, wherewith anoint the Part three or four times in a day.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Oils of the Yolks of Eggs and of Roſes, each one ounce and an half, of Sacharum Saturni one drachm; ſtir them about in a leaden Mortar till they change colour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following is better than the reſt, and with it Tumors of the Paps, which are counted cancerous, may be perfectly cured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Oil of Yolks of Eggs two ounces, of the Juice of Night-ſhade and Speedwel, or of Houſleek, each half an ounce, of crude Mercury two drachms; ſtir them about in a leaden Mortar, with a leaden Peſtle, till they acquire the conſiſtence of a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The foreſaid Liniments are to be put into the Womb with a long Tent, or with a Wax-Candle, wrapt round with a Rag: But Injections may be much eaſier uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Barly-Water half a pint, of the Waters of Night-ſhade, and Plantain, each two ounces, of the Water of Speedwel one ounce, of the white Troches of Rhaſis two drachms, of Sacharum Saturni one drachm: Make an injection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Pain be very violent add to four ounces of the Injection one ounce of the Syrup of Popies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:65404:183"/>Foment the part affected with the Waters of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Night-ſhade, or with the decoction of them, whereunto may be added the Leaves of Water-lillies, white Poppies, and red Roſes and Camphor; which Decoction may be alſo frequently injected into the Womb, and it will be much more effectual, if it be ſtirr'd about in a leaden Mortar, or if Sacharum Saturni be mixed with it.</p>
                  <p>Among Specificks, are commended Frogs waſh'd and boil'd, and apply'd inſtead of a Cataplaſm, or a deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them injected; alſo, the decoction or juice of River-crabs injected into the Womb, or Herb-Robert taken inwardly or apply'd.</p>
                  <p>If the Cancer be ulcerated the Doſe of the Minerals to be added to the foreſaid Linimenss muſt be increas'd. and the Aſhes of River-Crabs may be conveniently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them; but with the Injections may be mixt the white Troches of Rhaſis and Barly-water.</p>
                  <p>If the Pain be very violent, Fomentations of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Marſh-mallows, Water-lillies, Poppies, Henbane, green Coriander, Dill, of the ſeed of Pſyllium, Milk, Saffron, and the like, may be uſed by Intervals, or a Cataplaſm made of them may be apply'd, with which alſo Decoctions, Injections and Baths may be alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe things are not ſometimes ſufficient to appeaſe the violent Pain, which ſometimes will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſick to ſleep or reſt, ſo that we are forced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to uſe Narcoticks; and indeed, they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious in this Diſeaſe. I knew a Woman that was afflicted with a Cancer in her Breaſt, who took every Night for four Months two or three Grains of Laudanum, and was much reliev'd by it.</p>
                  <p>If much Blood flow from a Cancer ulcerated, as it often happens, inject into the Womb the juice of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with a little Frankincenſe.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CII. Of a Gangrene and Mortification of the Womb.</head>
                  <p>A Gangrene is an incipient Mortification; this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is eaſily generated in a Womans Privities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Parts are very moiſt and ſoft, and eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Excrements of the whole Body; it often ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds an Inflammation, Abſeſs or Ulcer ill cured, when the vital heat of the part is ſuffocated and deſtroy'd, it is ſuffocated in great Inflammations, when more Blood flows in, than the innate heat of the part can digeſt; 'tis deſtroy'd either by a cold Intemperies that extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes it, or by an hot that diſſipates and reſolves it.</p>
                  <p>An incipient Gangrene is known by an unuſual heat that is perceiv'd in the part; a ſhaking and ſhivering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo invades, with a languid and frequent Pulſe, and with Fainting, and becauſe moſt commonly this Diſeaſe is chiefly ſeated on the Neck of the Womb, and ſo the part affected may be ſeen, that appears ſoft, livid, black and cadaverous, and may be prick'd and cut without feeling, and ſends forth a fetid and cadaverous Stink.</p>
                  <p>As to the prognoſtick, this Diſeaſe is very dangerous and moſt commonly deadly. But it has been obſerved by many Authors, that the Womb having been corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted or gangren'd has fallen off of its own accord, or has been cut off, and the Woman has done well.</p>
                  <p>The Cure is to be perform'd by the ſame Remedies wherewith the Gangrenes of the other parts us'd to be cur'd; if the Gangrene be in the neck of the Womb, or tend towards the external parts, Scarification muſt be us'd, and a decoction of Wormwood, Myrrh and the like; alſo Unguentum Aegyptiacum, and a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm made of the three Meals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Meals of Barly, Beans and Orobus, each two ounces, of Oxymell, one pint; boil them to the conſiſtenee of a Cataplaſm, but it will be more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, if you add the Meal of Lupines, Myrrh, Aloes and Wormwood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:65404:184"/>But if it be wholly corrupted it muſt be cut off, or in a falling of the Womb it muſt be bound by degrees harder and harder, till at length it falls off, of which Operations <hi>Schenkius</hi> has collected many Obſervations.</p>
                  <p>In the whole courſe of the Cure, Corroboratives muſt be us'd, and emollient cleanſing and cooling Gliſters muſt be frequently injected.</p>

                  <head>CHAP CIII. Of a Dropſie and Inflation of the Womb.</head>
                  <p>THE Inflation and Dropſie are confounded by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all Authors, but they are to be diſtinguiſh'd; for there is a certain Inflation of the Womb which ought not to be call'd a Dropſie, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Womb is inflated and ſtretch'd ſuddenly by Wind ruſhing in, upon which account a violent pain is occaſioned, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in the Cholick; and, therefore, if this Inflation does not laſt long, it does not deſerve the name of a Dropſie; ſuch an one is often in hyſterick Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, a Dropſie of the Womb is twofold; one from Wind, which is like a Timpany; another, from a watry Humour, which is like the Dropſie of the Belly: Some add a third, from Phlegm.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of Wind, contain'd in the cavity of the Womb. <hi>Sennertus</hi> mentions an obſervation in a Woman, That when ſhe thought ſhe was with Child and about to be deliver'd, evacuated a great quantity of Wind, and her Belly preſently aſſwag'd. He alſo mentions Obſervations of great quantities of Water, contain'd in the cavity of the Womb.</p>
                  <p>But Authors teſtifie, That Water is ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Bladders, and excluded in them, and ſometimes a Dropſie of the Womb is complicated with being with Child, as <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> relates of his own Wife.</p>
                  <p>As to the Diagnoſtick of this Diſeaſe, many things are to be inquir'd into; firſt, how this particular Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:65404:184"/>
of the Womb may be diſtinguiſh'd from an univerſal Dropſie; ſecondly, how the Species of it may be known, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether it proceeds from Wind, Water or Phlegm; thirdly, Whether it ariſe primarily from the Womb, or be occaſion'd by the fault of ſome other part; fourthly, Whether the peccant Matter be contain'd in the cavity of the VVomb, or within the Membranes of it, or in Bladders; fifthly, How it may be diſtinguiſh'd from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tumours of the VVomb; ſixthly, How it may be diſtinguiſh'd from being with Child; ſeventhly, How it may be diſtinguiſh'd from a Mola.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt Queſtion, 'tis diſtinguiſh'd from an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Dropſie; for that in a Dropſie of the VVomb the Tumour poſſeſſes more the bottom of the VVomb, but an univerſal Dropſie extends equally the whole Belly; beſides, in a Dropſie of the VVomb, there is not ſo ſoon a paleneſs and waſting of the whole Body, as in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Dropſie, in which alſo moſt commonly there is conſiderable Drought, and dryneſs of the Tongue, but not in a Dropſie of the VVomb; and alſo in this, all the Symptoms are much milder, and the hardneſs when 'tis from VVind, or the fluctuation when 'tis occaſion'd by VVater, do not poſſeſs ſo great a ſpace, as in an univerſal Dropſie. And, laſtly, in a Dropſie of the VVomb, wind breaks out by Intervals, or a little water flows out, which manifeſtly ſhew, that wind or water is contain'd in it.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond Queſtion we anſwer in the following manner: The Species of a Dropſie in the VVomb are thus diſtinguiſh'd; if it be occaſion'd by wind, the bottom of the Belly ſounds, being ſtruck; there are pricking pains in the belly, which ſometimes run through the Diaphragm, Stomach, Loins, Navel and other parts; and ſometimes the wind does evidently break through the Neck of the VVomb, and the VVomen perceive the VVomb to riſe up often to the Stomach like a Ball; breathing is ſometimes difficult, the Diſeaſe grows worſe upon eating or drinking, and they often belch, and are better after it, and they are often troubl'd with Mother-fits: They ſometimes perceive a pain in the region of the Hypogaſter, ſo that they can't bear an Hand laid upon it; theſe Signs are alſo in an inflation of the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:65404:185"/>
Womb; but there is this difference, for as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, an inflation is but for a ſmall ſpace, but a Dropſie from wind continues much longer.</p>
                  <p>But if a Dropſie of the Womb is occaſion'd by Water, that Region appears ſoft and flaccid, for Wind cauſes a Tenſion; there is a greater weight in the part, and a ſound as it were of Water floating, and Water ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drops from the part. And, laſtly, if it proceed from Phlegm, there is a greater ſoftneſs and flaccidity of the part, which daily increaſes and afflicts the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hypogaſter, the Pubes Perineum and Loins, with an Oedematous ſwelling.</p>
                  <p>As to the third Queſtion, if there be Signs of the whole Bodies being ill affected, as by acute or long Fevers, by immoderate Hemorrhagies, by weakneſs of the Stomach, ſwellings of the Liver or Spleen, or by other obſtinate Diſeaſes of thoſe parts, with which the Dropſie of the Womb began and increaſed with them, there is good reaſon to conjecture, That the matter of the Dropſie is receiv'd in thoſe parts; but if when the whole Body is well, ſuch a Tumour happens, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds particular Diſeaſes of the Womb, as hard Labour, ſuppreſſion of the Courſes, or too large an evacuation of them, or Ulcers and Tumors, we may gueſs that the Dropſie of the Womb proceeds from them.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth Queſtion we anſwer, That the Matter which is contained in the cavity of the Womb, cauſes a much greater Tumor than when 'tis contain'd within the Membranes.</p>
                  <p>To the fifth Queſtion we anſwer, That a Dropſie of the Womb may be diſtinguiſh'd from Tumors that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a Phlegmon or an Eryſipelas, becauſe in theſe there is a Fever and Pain upon the leaſt touching; it may be diſtinguiſh'd from a Scirrhus or cancerous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, by the hardneſs that reſiſts the Finger upon touching.</p>
                  <p>To the ſixth Queſtion we anſwer, That when a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is with Child, the Tumor is not equal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd, but thruſts it ſelf out above the Navel. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when a Woman is with Child, after ſome Months ſhe is better moſt commonly; but the longer a Dropſie laſts, the worſer it grows. Thirdly, in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:65404:185"/>
with Child, the motion of the Fetus is manifeſtly felt, after the third or forth Month, which does not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in a Dropſie; yet ſometimes when a Dropſie ariſes from Wind, a Palpitation is perceiv'd in the Womb; but it may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the motion of a Child, becauſe 'tis more equal, and is wont to poſſeſs more parts of the Belly. Fourthly, when a Woman is with Child the Breaſts ſwell, but in a Dropſie they grow ſmall.</p>
                  <p>To the ſeventh Queſtion we anſwer, That in a Mola there is a weight felt in the Belly, which is not perceiv'd in a Dropſie of the Womb; and when the ſick lye on either ſide, a weight is perceiv'd, as if a Stone roll'd thither. Moreover, in a Mola there are violent Fluxes of the Courſes by Intervals, <hi>viz.</hi> every third of fourth Month, which does not happen in a Dropſy of the Womb. And, laſtly, in a Mola the Breaſts ſwell, and have Milk in them ſometimes; but there is no ſuch thing in a Dropſie.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick, a ſimple Inflation of the Womb is not dangerous; but if it continue long, it may turn to a Dropſie.</p>
                  <p>If Wind or Water be contain'd in the cavity of the Womb, 'tis eaſier cur'd than when 'tis included in the Membranes or in Bladders.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of this Diſeaſe is perform'd in a manner by the ſame Remedies which are propos'd for the Cure of a Dropſie or the Green-ſickneſs, but ſome things that are peculiar to this Diſeaſe muſt be added. And firſt, as to bleeding in a recent Diſeaſe occaſion'd by an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Courſes, and there being a fulneſs of Blood, it may be proper, otherwiſe 'tis injurious.</p>
                  <p>But Purging is always neceſſary, and it muſt be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated; and after ſufficient Purging, Aperitives, Diureticks, and ſuch things as move the Courſes muſt be us'd; to which may be added the following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Smallage and Madder, each half an ounce, of the Leaves of Savine, Feverfew and Penny-royal, each one pugil, of the Seeds of Daucus, one drachm; boil them in the Broath of young Pidgeons, and let her take it ſtrain'd in a Morning for many
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:65404:186"/>
days, but before ſhe takes the Broath, let her ſwallow one of the following Pills.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the beſt Caſtor, Myrrh and Madder, each half a drachm, of Saffron one ſcruple, with the juice of Lemons; make nine Pills.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the uſe of which Medicines violent Exerciſe muſt be us'd, that thereby the Excrements bred in the Bowels and in the habit of the Body may be diſſipated; and alſo, all that which is contain'd in the Womb, the Skins being broken by the violence of the exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>And if the Woman vomit eaſily, 'twill be proper to vomit her twice a Week, whereby not only the Humors flowing to the Womb may be recall'd and evacuated, but alſo the Skins ſticking to the Womb, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times containing a watry Humour, may perchance be broken, and ſo the ill Humors may flow out.</p>
                  <p>The following Bolus is very effectual to diſcuſs the Humour contain'd in the Womb.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Mineral Borox half a drachm, of Saffron half a ſcruple, with the juice of Savin; make a Bolus, to be taken twice a week.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sudorificks are alſo very proper in this Diſeaſe, for by them the watry Humours contained in the Womb, or the whole Body, may be diſcuſs'd and evacuated.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while the heat of the Stomach muſt be ſtrengthened by things taken inwardly, and outwardly apply'd.</p>
                  <p>And outwardly muſt be apply'd proper topical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to ſtrengthen the Womb, and to diſcuſs the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors contain'd in it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, may be prepar'd Fomentations and Baths, made of a decoction of the Roots of Briony and wild Cucumber, of the Leaves of Dwarf-elder, Mercury-elder, wild Marjoram, Calaminth, Wormwood, Rue, Sage, Marjoram, Thyme, Bays, Penny-royal, Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, of the Seeds of Broom, Daucus, Cummin, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe, Fennel, Laurel-borries and Juniper-berries, the Flowers of Camomile, Melilote and Roſemary, of which
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:65404:186"/>
may be made Bags to be boil'd in Wine, or the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid things may be boil'd in a Lee made of the aſhes of the Twigs of a Vine.</p>
                  <p>But that the foremention'd Fomentations may operate the better, they muſt be applied before and behind, and the Sick ought to ſweat, if ſhe can, in the Bed, or in a Bath.</p>
                  <p>In a windy Dropſie dry Fomentations are more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial with Bags made of Gromwel, Salt, Cummin and Bran, torrefied in a Frying-Pan, and ſprinkled with Wine.</p>
                  <p>After the Fomentation, anoint the Belly with the Oils of Nard, Dill, Rue, Wormwood, and Southernwood, which if they are drawn chymically will be much more effectual.</p>
                  <p>After you have anointed the Belly apply the Plaſter of Laurel-berries, or a Cataplaſm of Cow-Dung, Sheeps-Dung, of the Seeds of Smallage, Parſly, Cummin and boiled Hony.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame uſe is commended the Skin of a Sheep newly kill'd, and ſprinkled with hot Wine.</p>
                  <p>Gliſters muſt be alſo frequently injected made of a Decoction of Wormwood, wild Marjoram, Pennyroyal, Rue, Centory and the like, or with Oils of Rue, Nuts, Dill and White-wine or Mallago-Sack, wherein muſt be diſſolv'd Benedictum Laxativum, Turpentine, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Hony and the like.</p>
                  <p>Injections for the Womb may be prepar'd in the following manner, to evacuate the Humours contain'd in it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Aſarabacca three drachms, of the Leaves of Pennyroyal and Calaminth each one hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, of the Seeds of Savine one pugil, of Mechoacan one drachm, of the ſeeds of Anniſe and Cummin, each half a drachm; boil them, and in the ſtrain'd Liquor diſſolve of Oil of Orrice and of Elder, each one ounce, in ſix ounces of the Liquor, and make an Injection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſame Uſe Peſſaries may be made in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="394" facs="tcp:65404:187"/>
                     <hi>Take of Coloquintida and Mechoacan each one dracm, of Salt of Niter half a ſcruple, with a ſufficient quantity of boil'd Hony, make a Peſſary.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Elaterium half a drachm, of Figs bruis'd a ſufficient quantity, make a Peſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Inflation is occaſion'd by Wine, a Fume made of Nutmegs and conveyed through a Tunnel has done much good.</p>
                  <p>And in the ſame caſe a Cupping-Glaſs applied to the Navel, with much Flame, diſcuſſes Wind powerfully.</p>

                  <p>For the Pain of the Womb, which often afflicts the Sick in this Diſeaſe, <hi>Amatus Lucitanus</hi> commends the Water or Decoction of Camomel, four or five Ounces, of it being taken at a time.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, if an Inflation happen after Delivery there is no need of any other Cleanſing than that of the Womb; but if it does not proceed well, it muſt be helpt by drawing Peſſaries, and by Cupping-Glaſſes applied to the Thighs, and by other Remedies preſcrib'd for the Stoppage of the Courſes; and if Wind be the cauſe, the Fume of Nutmegs above-propoſed is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CIV. Of a Falling of the Womb.</head>
                  <p>FOR the Cure of this Diſtemper regard muſt be had to two things; the firſt is to reduce the Womb into its natural Place, and the ſecond is to ſtrengthen it, and keep it there.</p>
                  <p>For the Execution of the firſt, which is to reduce it, if the Womb be quite out or turned, the Woman muſt firſt of all render her Urine, and a Gliſter muſt be given, if it be neceſſary, to empty the groſs Excrements that are in the right-Gut, that ſo the Reduction may be the eaſier perform'd; then place her on her Back, with her Hips rais'd a little higher than her Head, and then foment all that is fallen out with a little Wine and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter luke-warm, and with a ſoft Rag put it up into its proper Place, thruſting back not all at once, but wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by little and little from ſide to ſide, in caſe this be too painful, becauſe 'tis already too big and ſwell'd; anoint it with Oil of Almonds, for the more eaſie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of it, being careful as ſoon as 'tis reduc'd, to wipe off the Oil as much as may be, to avoid a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe: But if notwithſtanding all this, the Womb can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be put up, becauſe 'tis very much inflamed and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mified, which happens when it has been a long time ſo, without the uſe of neceſſary means, during which time it is continually moiſtned with Urine and other Excrements, which contribute very much to its Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, in this caſe there is great danger that 'twill gangrene.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the ſecond part of this Cure, which conſiſts in the retention of the Womb in its place, and the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it; It will be done by a convenient ſituation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let the Woman, for this purpoſe, keep her ſelf in Bed, on her Back, having her Hips a little raiſed, her Legs ſomething croſſed, and her Thighs join'd together, to prevent the falling of it out again; but the beſt way is to put up a Peſſary into the Neck of the Womb, to
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:65404:188"/>
keep it firm. There are two or three ſorts of them made for this purpoſe, the Figures of them may be ſeen in <hi>Moriceau</hi>'s Midwifery; ſee Page 311.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oak-Bark two ounces, boil it in two quarts of Fountain-Water, add at the latter end one ounce of Pomegranate-Peel bruis'd, red Roſes, Pomegranate-Flowers, each two handfuls, and then add half a pint of red Wine, ſtrain it, and bath the part affected with Flannels dipt in it, in the Morning, two hours before the Woman riſes, and at Night, when ſhe is in Bed; continue the uſe of it 'till the Symptom is quite gone.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. CVI. Of Miſcarriage.</head>
                  <p>MIſcarriage is the Excluſion of an imperfect or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe Child, and conſequently a Child dead in the Womb is not ſaid abortive till it is excluded; ſo that whether alive or dead Child be brought forth not being ripe, nor having attained to the juſt growth in the Womb, it is to be termed abortive.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes of Abortion are ſome Internal, ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal; the Internal may be reduced to four Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Humors, to the Child, to the Womb, and to the Diſeaſe of the Mother.</p>
                  <p>The Humors may occaſion Abortion, when they offend in quantity or quality.</p>
                  <p>They offend in quantity, either by way of exceſs or defect.</p>
                  <p>The quantity is exceſſive in a Plethora; for there being more Blood than is requiſit to nouriſh the Fetus, it flows into the Veins of the Womb, and is excluded like the monthly Courſes, and ſo the Child comes away with it.</p>
                  <p>There is too ſmall a quantity of the nutritious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor when the Child's nouriſhment is by any means leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, as by Faſting, whether volunary or forced; and when Women with Child nauſeat all ſorts of Food, or vomit it up again: Likewiſe, by reaſon of a thin Diet in acute Diſeaſes, or by an immoderate evacuation of Blood: Likewiſe, by reaſon of extream leanneſs of the whole Body.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect of the Child, Abortion may happen if it be over great, ſo that it cannot by reaſon of its bulk be contained in the Womb; and for this reaſon little Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men often miſcarry, eſpecially if they are married to Men bigger than ordinary, whoſe Children grow very great, and find not in the Womb a ſpace large enough to contain them, till they come to their perfect growth;
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:65404:191"/>
alſo, plurality of Children may occaſion Abortion, as when two or three, or more, are contained in the Womb at one time.</p>
                  <p>The Womb it ſelf occaſions Abortion, if it be not large and capacious enough to widen it ſelf ſufficiently according as the Child grows, or if there be any thing preternatural in the Womb, as an Inflammation, a Scirrhus, or Impoſthume, or the like; or if the Womb be over moiſt and ſlack, ſo that it cannot contain the Child ſo well as it ought to do.</p>
                  <p>Abortion comes two ways from the Diſeaſes of the Mother: Firſt, when her Diſeaſes are communicated to the Child, whereby it is killed or ſo weakned, that it cannot receive due nouriſhment nor growth; ſuch are continual Fevers and Agues, the French Pox, and many ſuch like. Secondly, when the ſaid Diſeaſes of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe great Evacuations, or great Commotions of the Body; as large Bleeding from what part of the Body ſoever, Fluxes of the Belly, grievous Swooning, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-ſickneſs, Vomiting and a Teneſmus, which above all other Diſeaſes is wont to cauſe Abortion.</p>
                  <p>External Cauſes which further Abortion, do ſome of them kill the Child, others draw away it's nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and others diſſolve thoſe Bands wherewith the Child is faſtned to the Womb.</p>
                  <p>The Child is killed by great Commotions of the Mind, as by Anger, Sadneſs, Frights, and the like; by Meats earneſtly longed for, and not obtained; by ſtrong purging Medicines, by things that provoke the Courſes, and by thoſe things that expel the Child, and by ſuch things as are reckoned by a Specifick Quality to deſtroy the Child in the Womb, by abominable Smells; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the ſtink of a Candle ill put out.</p>
                  <p>Violent Exerciſe diſſolves the Bands that faſten the Child to the Womb; as Dancing, Running, Riding, Jolting in a Coach or Cart, carrying or lifting from the Ground a heavy Weight, a violent Fall, a Blow on the Belly, vehement Motion of the Belly, by Cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Vomiting, Looſeneſs, Sneezing, Convulſions, Crying-out, immoderate or over-wanton Embraces, and in a word, vehement motion of the Arms, the turning a Wheel, or doing ſome ſuch work, may exceedingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Abortion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:65404:191"/>The Signs of preſent Abortion are manifeſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but ſuch as go before Abortion, and prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſame, are theſe: An unuſual heavineſs of the Loins and Hips, an unwillingneſs to ſtir, Appetite gone, ſhivering and ſhaking coming by Fits, pain of the Head, eſpecially about the Roots of the Eyes, a ſtraitening of the Sides and Belly above the Navel, the flagging or fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and extenuation of the Dugs; but if frequent pains, and almoſt continual Torment, the Reins and Loins reaching towards the Share, as far as the Os ſacrum, with endeavours to evacuate the Womb, certainly the Woman will ſhortly miſcarry.</p>
                  <p>If from violent external Cauſes, ſuch as are a Blow, a Fall, and the like, vehement Pain and Perturbation ariſe in a Woman with Child; ſhe ought to keep her Bed three days or longer.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſticks, Women are more endangered by Abortion than by a true and timely Birth, becauſe it is more violent and unſeaſonable; for as in ripe Fruit, the Stalks are looſened from the Boughs, and the Fruit falls off of it ſelf; ſo in a natural Birth, the Veſſels and Ligaments wherewith the Child is tyed to the Womb are looſened and untyed, as it were, of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, which in Abortion muſt needs be vioiently bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken aſunder. Abortion is moſt dangerous in the ſixth, ſeventh and eighth Month.</p>
                  <p>Our ordinary Women ſay, A miſcarrying Woman is half with Child again.</p>
                  <p>The Cure of Abortion conſiſts in Preſervation; for that which is paſt, cannot be helpt: But all the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms which follow Abortion, are the ſame which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Women duly brought to bed.</p>
                  <p>The preſervation from Abortion conſiſts principally in theſe two things; the one concerns the Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe is with Child, and the other when ſhe is with Child.</p>
                  <p>Before the Woman is with Child, all Indiſpoſitions of the Body, which are wont to cauſe Abortion, muſt be removed; as fulneſs of Blood, ill Humours, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Diſeaſes of the Womb, <hi>viz.</hi> Intemperies, Swellings, Ulcers, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="404" facs="tcp:65404:192"/>Fulneſs of Blood opens the Veins of the Womb, or ſtrangles the Infant while it is in the Womb; this, if it be a pure and ſimple Plenitude, may be cured by Blood-letting, ſuch as ſhall anſwer the quantity of Blood ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabounding.</p>
                  <p>A Cacochymy is either Cholerick, and partaking of Acrimony, ſo as to open the Orifices of the Veins, or by provoking Nature; it ſtirs up the expulſive Faculty, whereby the Child comes to be expelled with thoſe ill Humours; or it ſuffocates the Child, by reaſon of plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Excrements heap'd together in the firſt Region, and diſtending the Belly; or it vitiates the Blood in the whole Body, rendring it unfit to nouriſh the Child; or it fills the Veſſels of the Womb which retain the Child, with a ſlymy moiſture.</p>
                  <p>Bleeding may be alſo uſed for this Cacochymy, in a ſmall quantity; but the chiefeſt way of Cure is by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Purging, that the ſuperfluous Excrements of the Body may be evacuated; and betwixt Purge and Purge, ſuch things muſt be uſed as aſſwage the Intemperies of the Bowels, and the Acrimony of the Humors if there be any, and thicken the ſaid Humors, in caſe they be too thin, and if flegmatick Humors abound, they muſt be diſcuſſed with Sudorificks and Diureticks, and other Remedies; howbeit, we muſt diligently obſerve, that whatever ill Humors abound, Iſſues are very proper to prevent Abortion; of which <hi>Zacutus Luſitanus</hi> gives a ſpecial note in theſe words: <hi>By most happy Experiments I have obſerved, That frequent Abortion cauſed by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Humors, which flow from the whole Body to the Womb, and by their evil diſpoſition or abundance kill the Child, is hereby, as by a moſt preſent help, prevented; many Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have miſcarried on this account, among whom ſome having oftentimes brought a Child of ſeven Months, or four Months growth, torn and putrified, cou'd by no other means be freed from ſo great a Calamity, ſave by Iſſues made in their Arms and Thighs, which were always made at the beginning of the Fluxion; by which means they went out their time, and brought forth Children healthy, and not defiled with any Infection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>If theſe Diſeaſes happen when a Woman is with Child, the difficulty is greater, becauſe big-bellied Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men cannot ſo eaſily bear all kind of Remedies; yet, leſt being deſtitute of all help, they ſhould remain in extream danger of Miſcarriage and Death, ſome kind of Remedies are to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>In caſe, therefore, the Patient be too full of Blood, ſhe muſt have a Vein opened, tho' ſhe be with Child, eſpecially in the firſt Months, and ſo twice or thrice if need be, always remembring that there never be much Blood taken away at a time.</p>
                  <p>And when there is abundance of ſome ill Humors, gentle Purging muſt be repeated, eſpecially in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Months; and if a moiſt and flatulent, or ſlymy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies annoy the Patient, we may ſometimes proceed to a Sudorifick Diet, at leaſt a gentle one, in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſort of Women.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, theſe aſtringent and ſtrengthening Medicines are to be uſed all the time the Woman is with Child, that are proper to hinder Abortion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Kermes-berries and Tormentil-roots, each three ounces, of Maſtich, one drachm and an half; make a Powder, of which give now and then half a drachm, or as much as will lie on the point of a Knife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, <hi>Take of red Coral, two drachms, Kermes-berries, Date-ſtones, each one drachm, ſhavings of Ivory half a drachm, of Pearls not bor'd, one ſcruple; make a Powder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, let her take every day in the morning, ſome grains of Maſtich.</p>
                  <p>Our ordinary Women uſe frequently Plantain-ſeed, which they take in the morning to the quantity of half a drachm with Wine and Water, or in an Egg, or Broath, or by it ſelf, almoſt every day, all the while they are with Child, and with good ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="406" facs="tcp:65404:193"/>To the ſame purpoſe, very effectual Electuaries are compounded, according to the following Example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Conſerve of Roſes, two ounces, of Citron-peel candied, ſix drachms, of Myrabolans candied, of the pulp of Dates, each half an ounce, of Coral prepared, Pearl prepared, and ſhavings of Hartſhorn, each one drachm, with ſyrup of Quinces; make an Electuary, of which let the Patient take often the quantity of a Nutmeg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Liquor be more pleaſing, a Decoction of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentil-roots ſweet'ned with Conſerve of Roſes, may be given ſucceſsfully.</p>
                  <p>The following Lozenges are very good; for they ſtrengthen, and by little and little free the Body from Excrements, though they do not ſenſibly purge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Mace, of the three ſorts of Sanders, Rhubarb, Sena, Coral, Pearl, each one ſcruple, of Sugar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Roſe-water, four ounces; make all into Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenges, weighing three drachms apiece. Let her take one twice a week by it ſelf, or diſſolved in a little Broath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ointments and Plaſters are to be applied outwardly.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Or, <hi>Take of Oil of Myrtles and Maſtich, each one ounce, of red and yellow Sanders, Hypociſtis and Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, each half an ounce, of Spodium and red Roſes, each two drachms, of Bole-armonick, ſeal'd Earth, Ivory, each two ſcruples, of Turpentine waſhed in Plantain-water, one ounce, with a ſufficient quantity of Wax; make a Cereloath, ſpread it on Cloath, and apply it to the Reins,</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="407" facs="tcp:65404:193"/>Or, <hi>Take of the Plaſter for the Matrix three ounces, of Biſtort-roots, Acacia, Hypociſtis, Pomgranat-peels, each half an ounce, of Labdanum, ſix drachms; ſoften them with the juice of Quinces, and make a Plaſter for the uſe aforeſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to Plaſters it is to be noted, That they muſt not be worn long together, but taken off now and then; otherwiſe, if they ſtick too long upon the Back, they do ſo heat the Kidnies, that ſometimes they occaſion an heat of Urine, and the voiding by Urine Sand, Stones, yea Blood it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Nor are thoſe things to be omitted, which are accounted Specificks for retaining the Child in the Womb, as the Eagle's ſtone worn about the Neck, a Load-ſtone applied to the Navel, Corals, Jaſpers, Smaragds, Bones found in the Hearts of Stags, and ſuch like, worn under the Arm-pits or hanged about the Neck.</p>
                  <p>But that the ſucceſs of theſe Medicines may be good, the Patient muſt be ordered to reſt, and to keep her ſelf as quiet as poſſibly ſhe can, both in Body and Mind, and to abſtain from Coition, which does much diſquiet the Womb; for whilſt the Womb opens it ſelf to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Semen,</hi> with which it is much delighted, it drops out the tender Fetus, not yet well ſetled in the Womb.</p>
                  <p>But if notwithſtanding the Medicines aforeſaid, by reaſon of the vehemency of the Cauſe, whether it be external or internal, the Patient be ready to miſcarry, we muſt do the beſt we can with theſe following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. And, in the firſt place, ſo ſoon as Pains and Throws ſhall be perceived to be in the lower parts of the Belly, towards the Pubis, in the Loins, and about the Os ſacrum, we muſt ſeek to allay and ſtop them, both by Medicines taken inwardly, and outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, according to the variety of the Cauſes; for if Abortion be cauſed by Crudities and Wind (which is moſt uſual when it begins from an internal Cauſe,) a Powder muſt be given, made of Aromaticum Roſatum
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:65404:194"/>
and Coriander-ſeeds; and we may give of the Aqua Imperialis, if Phlegm and Wind abound.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time let Carminative Medicines be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied below the Navel of the Patient; ſuch are, Bags of Anniſeeds, Fennel-ſeeds, Fenugreek-ſeeds, Flowers of Camomile, Elder, Roſemary and Stechas mixed together; or a Roſe-cake fried in a Pan with rich Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and ſprinkled with Powder of Nutmegs and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander-ſeeds, or the Gaul of a Wether newly kill'd, or his Lungs laid on warm,</p>
                  <p>If by theſe means the pains ceaſe not, let a Gliſter be injected made of Wine and Oil, wherein two drachms of Philonium Romanum may be diſſolved, or Narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks may be given inwardly in a ſmall quantity, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the violence of the Humors and Wind, as we are wont to do in the pains of the Cholick.</p>
                  <p>But if by reaſon of contumacious pains that will not be aſſwaged, or of the violence of ſome external cauſe, Blood begins to come away, Medicines that cauſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion are to be applied to turn the courſe of the Blood from the Womb; ſuch are, Frictions of the upper parts and painful Ligatures, alſo Cupping-glaſſes faſtened to the Shoulder-blades under the Dugs, and under the ſhort Ribs on both ſides; and if the Woman be full of Blood, it will not be amiſs to take ſome blood from her, when ſhe begins to void blood, and eſpecially before it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to come; and the blood muſt be taken away at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times, a little at once.</p>
                  <p>And if the flux of blood continues, we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to an aſtringent and thickening Diet and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and ſo the Powders and Electuaries before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed may be adminiſtred; alſo juice of Plantain new drawn, and ſyrup of Poppies to the quantity of an ounce, with Powder of Bole-armenick or Dragons-blood.</p>
                  <p>Alſo binding and aſtringent Fomentations may be uſed outwardly, made of Pomgranate-peels, Cypreſs-nuts, Acorn-cups, Baclauſtins, Grape-ſtones and the like boiled in Smiths water and red Wine.</p>
                  <p>Or a little bag full of red Roſes and Balauſtins may be boiled, and applied hot to the Patient's Belly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:65404:194"/>The above-mentioned Plaſters and Cere-cloaths may be uſed; and to bind more, make a Pultiſs of aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Powders, with Turpentine and whites of Eggs, ſpread it upon Tow or courſe Flax, and apply it to the Navel and Reins warm: The Tow that is to be applied to the Navel muſt be moiſtened with Wine, that which is to be apply'd to the Kidnies, with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. The two following Medicines are accounted Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, and it is believed they will certainly retain the Child in the Womb, if they be uſed before it be torn from the Veſſels of the Womb.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Leaves of Gold, number twelve, of Spodium one drachm, the Cock's treading of three Eggs not addled; mix all very well, till the Gold be broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmall pieces, afterwards diſſolve them in a draught of white Wine, and give it three Mornings follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. CVII. Of hard Labour.</head>
                  <p>THAT is ſaid to be hard Labour which does not obſerve the due and ordinary courſe of Nature, and longer time is ſpent in it, and the pains are more violent than uſual, and the Symptoms that accompany it are more grievous.</p>
                  <p>Many Cauſes may be aſſigned of it, both external and internal: The internal depend on the Mother, the Womb or the Child.</p>
                  <p>As to the Mother, the natural weakneſs of the whole Body may make the Labour difficult, or her Age, ſhe being too young or too old, or it may be occaſioned by Diſeaſes which ſhe had with her Big-belly, Leanneſs and too much dryneſs of the Body, or Fat compreſſing the Paſſages of the Womb; the ill conformation of the Bones encompaſſing the Womb as in thoſe that are Lame, may alſo occaſion it, Wind ſwelling the Bowels, a Stone, or a preternatural Tumour in the Bladder that preſſes the Womb, may be the cauſe; ſo may the ill conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lungs, or of the parts ſerving Reſpiration: For the holding of the Breath is very neceſſary to help the excluſion of the Child.</p>
                  <p>As to the Womb, various Diſeaſes of it may render the Delivery difficult, as Tumors Ulcers, Obſtructions, and the like.</p>
                  <p>As to the Child, hard Labour is occaſion'd, when by reaſon it is dead or putrified, or any way diſeaſed, it cannot confer any thing to its own excluſion: Alſo, when the Body or Head of it is large, or when there are many.</p>
                  <p>So Twins moſt commonly cauſe hard Labour, or when it is ill ſituated, as when the Hands or the Feet offer firſt, or when one Hand or one Foot comes out, or when it is doubled, or when the Membranes break too ſoon, ſo that the Water flows out, and leaves the Orifice of the Womb dry at the time of excluſion, or
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:65404:195"/>
when the Membranes are too thick, ſo that they cannot be eaſily broken by the Child.</p>
                  <p>The external cauſes depend on things neceſſary and contingent; things neceſſary are thoſe which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly call'd Non-natural; ſo cold and dry Air, and a North-wind are very injurious to Women in Labour, becauſe they bind the Body, and drive the Blood and Spirits to the inner Parts, and they are very injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Child coming from ſo warm a place; alſo, hot Weather diſſipates the Spirits, and weakens the Child, and cauſes a Fever in an ill habit of Body. Crude Aliments and ſuch as are difficultly concocted, and thoſe that bind, taken in great quantity before Labour, do render it difficult, the Stomach being weakened, and the common Paſſages contracted, which ought to be very open in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Drowſineſs hinders the action of the Mother and Child, and ſhews that Nature is weak. The unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able motion of the Woman much retards the delivery; as when ſhe refuſes upon occaſion to ſtand, walk, lie or ſit, or flings her ſelf about unadviſedly, ſo that the Child can not be born the right way, being turned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly by the reſtleſneſs of the Mother.</p>
                  <p>The retention of ſuch things as ſhould be evacuated at the time of Labour, as of Urine that ſwells the Bladder, or Excrements in the right Gut; the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids alſo much ſwelled, narrow the neck of the Womb, and ſo hinder Natures endeavours.</p>
                  <p>And, laſtly, violent Paſſions of the Mind, as Fear, Sorrow and Anger, make the Labour difficult.</p>
                  <p>To things contingent ought to be referred, a Blow, a Fall or a Wound, which may much obſtruct Labour; alſo, the By-ſtanders, which ought to aſſiſt the Woman, <hi>viz.</hi> ſtrong Women and Maids, which may lift her up juſt at the time of Delivery, eſpecially a skilful Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, which ought to adviſe in every matter, for if ſhe be unskilful ſhe may make the Labour difficult: For ſometimes the Midwife orders the Woman to endeavour an Expulſion, and to ſtop her Breath when the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Fetus ſtick firmly to the Womb, ſo that the Woman is tired before the time of her Delivery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:65404:196"/>Difficult Labour is known, both by the Woman, by the By-ſtanders, and eſpecially by the Midwife. And, firſt, if the Woman continue a long time in Labour, <hi>viz.</hi> two, three, four or more days, whereas a natural Birth is finiſhed in 24 hours. Another Sign of difficult Labour is languid pains, returning at long Intervals; alſo, the pains tending backward rather than forward: But the Cauſes of difficult Labour may be known by the Womans Relation, and moſt commonly upon ſight. So the weakneſs of the Woman, or leanneſs, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatneſs, may be ſeen by the habit of Body. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes of the Womb may be known by their proper Signs, the weakneſs of the Child by the weak and ſlow motion of it: But the ſigns of a dead Child may be known by the following Chapter. The bigneſs of the Child may be judged of by the ſtature of the Parents, eſpecially if a gigantick Man be married to a dwarfiſh Woman: But when there are none of theſe Cauſes, and the Womans and Childs endeavours are ſtrong, and yet the Labour is difficult, it is a ſign that the Secundine is ſo ſtrong, that it cannot be eaſily broken, and this will be confirmed if no water or moiſture flows out in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The prepoſterous figure of the Fetus may be perceived by the Midwife, and other things, as has been ſaid, by ſight.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick, difficult Labour is of it ſelf dangerous, and ſometimes the Woman, and ſometimes the Child, and ſometimes both are extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>If a Woman continue in Labour four days, ſhe will hardly eſcape.</p>
                  <p>Sleepy Diſeaſes and Convulſions coming upon hard Labour, are moſt commonly deadly.</p>
                  <p>Sneeſing coming upon hard Labour, is good.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure of hard Labour: Firſt, all thoſe things which retard it muſt, as much as may be, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; afterwards, Medicines that further Labour muſt be methodically adminiſtred.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, it is common with Women to give a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or two of Cinnamon-water, or Cinnamon pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with a little Saffron, or half a drachm of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Alkerms in broath, or half a ſcruple of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron alone in ſome broath, or every hour in a little VVine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="413" facs="tcp:65404:196"/>Or, <hi>Take of Oil of ſweet Almonds and of white Wine, each two ounces, of Saffron and Cinnamon, each twelve grains, of Confection of Alkermes, half a drachm, of ſyrup of Maiden-hair, one ounce and an half; mingle them, make a Potion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If theſe things are not ſufficient, the following may be uſed, which I have frequently found very effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Dittany, of Crete, and both the Birthworts, and of Troches of Myrrh, each half a ſcruple, of Saffron and Cinnamon, each twelve grains, of Confection of Alkermes, half a drachm, of Cinnamon-water half an ounce, of Orange-flower-water, and of Mugwort-water, each one ounce; make a Potion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oil of Ambar, of Cinnamon, and extract of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron are very effectual in a ſmall quantity, <hi>viz.</hi> five grains of extract of Saffron, four or five drops of Oil of Cinnamon, twelve or fifteen drops of Oil of Ambar, in VVine, Broath, or ſome other Liquor.</p>
                  <p>Sneeſing haſtens Delivery; it may be provoked by the following Powder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of white Hellebore, half a drachm, of long Pepper, one ſcruple, of Caſtor, five grains, make a Powder; let the quantity of a Peaſe, be blown up into the Noſtrils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But difficult Labour muſt be helpt, not only with inward Remedies propoſed, but alſo with external; let the Midwife, therefore, frequently anoint the VVomb with the Oils of Lillies, ſweet Almonds, Linſeed and the like; and let the Belly be fomented with an emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient decoction of the Roots of Marſh-mallows, Lillies, the leaves of Mallows, Violets, Mugwort, of Linſeeds, Fenugreek-ſeeds, of the flowers of Camomile and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilot.</p>
                  <p>Sharp Gliſters are to be injected, by the irritation of which the expulſive faculty of the VVomb will be ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated,
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:65404:197"/>
and the Guts being emptied thereby, there will be more room for the VVomb.</p>
                  <p>Anoint the Navel with Oil of Ambar; and ſuch things as are thought to help Delivery by a ſpecifick quality are to be uſed, as the Eagle's-ſtone, the Load-ſtone, Storax, Calamint and the like bound to the Hips; and if the Woman has any Gems about her, as in Rings or the like, they muſt be pull'd off; for many Women think, that ſuch things retain the Child by a ſpecifick Quality. If the Child ſeem to be weak, it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, by giving ſtrengthening things to the Mother, as hot Wine, Confection of Alkermes, Cinnamon-water, and the like.</p>
                  <p>If the Child begins to come forth prepoſterouſly, as with one Arm, or firſt with the foot, or the like; the Midwife muſt thruſt them back, and turn the Child right, which may be done by placing the VVoman in a Bed upon her back, with her Head low, and her feet high; and then force the Child gently into the VVomb, and then the Midwife muſt endeavour to turn it right, <hi>viz.</hi> to turn the Face towards the Mothers back, and the Buttocks and Legs muſt be elevated towards the Mothers Navel, and ſo ſhe muſt haſten a legitimate Birth.</p>
                  <p>But all hopes of Delivery being paſt, or the Mother being near Death, ſome Authors propoſe the Ceſarian Section, whereof <hi>Franciſcus Roſſetus</hi> wrote an excellent Treatiſe, wherein he endeavours to ſhew, by many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that it may ſometimes ſucceed: But becauſe this operation is dangerous, and very terrible, it ought rarely or never to be attempted by a prudent Phyſician, if he values his own Reputation.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CVIII. Of a Dead Child.</head>
                  <p>WHen the Child is dead the Motion of it ceaſes, which either the Mother felt before in the Womb, or the Midwife with her Hand; a greater ſenſe of weight with Pain afflicts the Belly; when the Woman turns from ſide to ſide, ſhe perceives the Child fall like a Stone from one part to another, the Belly feels cold, the natural Heat being extinguiſh'd, and the Spirits diſſipated, which were contained in the Child; the Eyes are hollow, the Face and Lips pale, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream parts cold and livid, the Breaſts flaccid, and at length, the Child putrifying, a fetid Ichor and Sanies flows from the Womb, an ill and ſtrong ſmell exhales from the Woman's Body, and her Breath ſtinks: If the Secundine be excluded before the Fetus, it is a certain Sign that the Child is dead.</p>
                  <p>The whole Cure conſiſts in the excluſion or extraction of the Child.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leaves of Savin dryed, of the Roots of round Birthwort, of the Troches of Myrrh, and of Caſtor, each one drachm; of Cinnamon half a drachm; of Saffron one ſcruple: Mingle them, make a Powder, whereof let her take one drachm in Savin Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while apply to the Pubes, Privities, and Perineum an emolient Decoction.</p>
                  <p>After the Fomentation anoint the Parts with the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment de Arthanita, and let a Peſſary be put up the Privities.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CIX. Of the Secundine retained.</head>
                  <p>IN a Natural Birth the Secundine is wont moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be excluded preſently after the Child, yet ſometimes it is retained, whereby the Life is much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered.</p>
                  <p>The internal cauſes of this Retention are too great a thickneſs of the Coats, ſo that they ſtick firmly to the ſides of the Womb, the ſwelling of them, by an afflux of Humors occaſioned by hard Labour, and the ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Mouth of the Womb after the excluſion of the Fetus. The external cauſes are, coldneſs of the Air, whereby the Secundine is expelled, and the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Womb ſhut; certain Perfumes, whereby the Womb is allur'd upwards; violent Paſſions of the Mind, as fear and ſudden Frights; the perverſneſs of the Woman, who will not abide in ſuch a poſition, or uſe ſuch Endeavours as are requiſite; the weight of the Child, whereby the Navel is broken, the Secundine remaining within; the unskilfulneſs of the Midwife, who cuts the Umbilical Veſſels too ſoon, or does not hold them in her left hand as ſhe ought, for if they are let go they are drawn back into the Womb, and are
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:65404:198"/>
hid there with the Secundine, whereas it ought they ſerve for the extraction of the Secundine.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſie to be known when the Secundine is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Womb; but ſometimes a piece of it is ſeparated and remains in the Womb, which is not ſo eaſily found; yet it may be known, for that the Womb after delivery endeavours to eject ſomething: But tho' its endeavours are but ſmall, a ſenſe of Heat and Pain is perceived in the Womb, and after a few Days a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daverous Smell exhales from the Womb.</p>
                  <p>The retention of the Secundine is very dangerous, and if it continues ſome Days, an acute Fever, Nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Fainting, difficulty of Breathing, Coldneſs of the extream Parts, Epileptick and Hyſterick Fits, and at length Death follow.</p>
                  <p>The Secundine retained is expelled by the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies which were propoſed for a dead Child, to which may be added ſome Specificks delivered by Authors.</p>

                  <p>If the Secundine cannot be ejected by any means, but ſticks firmly to the Womb, and putrifies there, Suppuratives muſt be injected, mixed with things that cleanſe, that that which is putrified may be drawn out by degrees; to this purpoſe, <hi>Rondoletius</hi> commends Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilicon, eſpecially being diſſolv'd in the following De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CX. Of a Suppreſſion of the Child-bed Purgations.</head>
                  <p>THere is ſo great a Flux of Humors from all parts of the Womb, when a Woman is with Child, and during the Commotion in her Labour, that in caſe there be not afterwards ſufficient Evacuation of them, the Woman is in great danger of very ill Accidents, and ſometimes of Death it ſelf; becauſe theſe Humors cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting by their ſtay there, will certainly cauſe a great Inflammation: And this is the reaſon why the Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Lochia is one of the worſt and moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Symptoms which can befal a Woman after Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, eſpecially if they happen to be totally and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtopt the firſt three or four days, which is the time they ſhould come down plentifully; for then follow an acute Fever, great Pains in the Head, Pains in the Breaſt, Reins and Loins, Suffocation of the Mother, and an Inflammation, which is ſuddenly communicated to the Belly, which becomes very much ſwell'd and blown up; there happens alſo a great difficulty in Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Choakings, Palpitation of the Heart, Fainting, Convulſions, and often Death it ſelf, if the Suppreſſion continues, and if the Woman over-lives it, ſhe is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of an Abſceſs in the Womb, and afterwards of a Cancer, or there may happen great Impoſthumes in the Belly, alſo the Gout, Sciatica and Lameneſs, or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and Abſceſs in the Breaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Cauſes of the Stoppage of the Lochia proceed either from a great Looſneſs, becauſe a great Evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that way turns the Lochia, and makes them ſtop, or any ſtrong Paſſion of the Mind; ſo do great Colds, and cold Drink.</p>
                  <p>To bring the Lochia well down, let the Woman avoid all Perturbations of Spirit, which may ſtop them; let her lie in Bed with her Head and Breaſt a little raiſed, keeping her ſelf very quiet, that ſo the Humors may be carried downwards by their natural
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:65404:200"/>
tendency: Let her obſerve a good Diet, ſomewhat hot and moiſt, and apply an Hyſterick Plaſter to her Navel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Conſerves of Roman Wormwood and of Rue, each one ounce; of the Troches of Myrrh two drachms; of Caſtor, Engliſh Saffron, Volatil Salt of Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack and of Aſſa Fetida, each half a drachm: with a ſufficient quantity of the Syrup of the five opening Roots; make an Electuary. Let her take the quantity of a large Nutmeg every third Hour, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it three or four ſpoonfuls of the following Mixture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Water of Penny Royal and Balm, each three ounces; of compound Briony-Water two ounces; of Syrup of Mugwort three ounces and an half; of Saffron two drachms; of Caſtor tied up in a Rag and hanged in the Glaſs, one ſcruple; mingle them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If theſe things are uſed preſently upon the Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they generally take it off: But if they have been uſed ſo long that all the quantity is taken, and the Lochia are ſtill ſtopt, in this caſe we may uſe Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum for once, but it is beſt to mix it with hyſterick things: For inſtance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of liquid Laudanum ſixteen drops, in a ſpoonful of compound Briony-water:</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of ſolid Laudanum one grain and an half; of Aſſa Fetida one ſcruple and an half: Make two Pills.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it muſt be carefully noted, that if upon once tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Buſineſs is not done, Opium by no means muſt be repeated again: But having waited a while to ſee what it will do, we muſt return again to Emmenagoges mix'd with Hyſtericks, and afterwards we muſt Inject a Gliſter: But what was ſaid before of Opium is alſo to be taken notice of in reſpect of Gliſters; for unleſs the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65404:200"/>

                  <p>Theſe things therefore being done, it is ſafeſt, and the duty of a prudent Phyſician to wait and ſee what Time will do; for every Day the Danger will leſſen, and if the Sick live over the twentieth Day, ſhe will be in a manner out of Danger; for then ſhe will be able to bear that Method, which is fitteſt to conquer the Diſeaſes which were occaſioned by the Suppreſſion of the Lochia.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CXI. Of After-Pains.</head>
                  <p>PAins happen ſo frequently to Women in Childbed, that few are free from them; but they ſeldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Phyſicians help, becauſe they uſually ceaſe in two or three Days: But if they are ſharp and continue longer, they are forced to ſend for Phyſicians, who before they preſcribe ought to enquire into the cauſes of the Pains.</p>
                  <p>The chief Cauſes therefore of Pains after Labour are a great quantity of Blood, the Thickneſs and Acrimony of it, and the Narrowneſs of the Veſſels; for when the Veins of the Womb have ceaſed to evacuate Blood for nine Months; and when that is heaped up in a great quantity, and alſo grows thick and acrimonious by it's long ſtay, it occaſions Pain while it paſſes through the narrow Paſſages, which returns by Intervals, as often as the Womb endeavours the Evacuation of the Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when that is over, the Pain ceaſes till more Blood endeavours to come out.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Pains are alſo ſometimes occaſioned by Wind, or cold received into the Womb; but the Pain ſeldom happens from theſe Cauſes</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="422" facs="tcp:65404:201"/>This Pain is diſtinguiſhed from other Pains, that are wont to afflict the Belly, by the continuance or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, which follow the Evacuation of Blood, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can eaſily diſtinguiſh them themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The thick Blood eaſily coagulates, but the thin is known by its thinneſs and freſh colour.</p>
                  <p>If the Pain ariſes from Wind, it is more wandring, and poſſeſſes more parts of the Belly, nor does it follow the Intervals of the Evacuation of Blood: If cold Air be admitted into the Womb, it may be known by thoſe things which have been done about the Woman.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Pains are not dangerous, but are moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly very troubleſome, and therefore are to be taken off or aſſwaged as ſoon as may be.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, the Veſſels of the Womb muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed, and the thickneſs of the Blood attenuated, and its Acrimony qualified, all which may be done by the following means.</p>
                  <p>And firſt the Woman's Belly muſt be gently ſwathed, that it may ſubſide and not move hither and thither, as it often happens after Delivery, upon ſo ſudden an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, and then give of Oil of Almonds freſh drawn three ounces, mixed with an ounce and an half of Syrup of Violets.</p>
                  <p>And Gliſters may be injected made of Milk and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and Yolks of Eggs; or they may be prepared of a Decoction of Camomel-flowers, and of Mugwort in Chicken-broath, adding to them Oil of Lillies and Yolks of Eggs.</p>
                  <p>And the Belly of the Woman muſt be anointed with Carminitive and Aperitive Oils, as with Oil of Dill, Rue, Jaſmin, or with the following, which is very effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, which may be prepared for this uſe in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and kept in the Shops.</p>

                  <p>A Fomentation may be alſo made of a Decoction of Mugwort, Feverfew, Baulm, of the Leaves of Bays and Calaminth, of the Seeds of Daucas, Cummin and Caraways, of the Flowers of Wall-flower and Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel made in Water and White-Wine, or in Milk: Or the following Cataplaſm may be applied.</p>

                  <p>Child-bed Women after Delivery are often troubled with a Pain in the Groin; it may be taken off by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a Plaſter of Galbanum and Aſſafetida to the Navel, in the middle whereof ſome grains of Musk muſt be placed.</p>

                  <p>THE Fever from Milk, whilſt the Child-bed Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations proceed right, ſeldom laſts beyond three Days, for about that Time it uſually goes off, by a great Sweat coming of its own accord: But this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperies occaſioned by the coming of the Milk is ſomewhat heightned, and continues longer, when the Milk flows plentifully to the Breaſts, and is not milkt out, but repelled: For by its going back as well as its coming, there is a Diſturbance in the whole Body uſually, which comes more certainly, if the Milk be driven violently back by Repelling To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks.</p>
                  <p>Some common Rules are to be obſerved concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Coming of the Milk, or in driving of it back.</p>
                  <p>If the Milk flow too freely into the Breaſts, that the Inflammation of them, and the immoderate Efferve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence of the Blood may be prevented, a thin and ſpare Diet muſt be ordered, <hi>viz.</hi> of Broath without Fleſh, and the Breaſts muſt be often ſucked, and if it be not thought convenient that the Woman ſhould give Suck,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:65404:203"/>
it is cuſtomary on the Firſt or Third day of Lying-in, to apply over the Breaſts moderately Aſtringent Cere-cloaths: But this kind of Remedy muſt be uſed with Caution, leſt the Milk ſhould be Excluded altogether, or too haſtily, and ſo cauſe a diſorder in the Blood, and a putrid or malignant Fever, of which we ſhall ſpeak next.</p>
                  <p>Women with Child, by reaſon their Bodies are ill affected, are as it were infected with a Peſtilential Contagion, and ſo are very ſubject to a putrid, or rather malignant Fever. This Fever ſeizes Child-bed Women at various Seaſons, and upon ſeveral Occaſions; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preſently after Delivery, eſpecially if it has been difficult and hard; ſometimes on the firſt, ſometimes on the ſecond, third, or fourth Week; but the later it begins, the better it goes off. It begins and proceeds, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, in the following manner: After a previous Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition the Fever begins moſt commonly, with a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and Shivering, which Heat preſently follows, and after that Sweat; the firſt or ſecond day fits of Heat and Cold ſucceed one another, and then all the Blood being inflamed, the Lochia, if they were not ſuppreſſed before, flow but little, or quite ſtop. If the Diſeaſe be acute and of quick motion, it comes to its height the third or fourth day; the Heat is violent, and the Thirſt very much, the Pulſe vehement and quick, Watchings obſtinate, there is great Reſtleſſneſs, ſo that the Sick tumble from one ſide of the Bed to the other continually, the Urin is thick and red, and there are many other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Symptoms; when this Fever is in its State, no Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is to be expected; for I never ſaw this Diſeaſe go off by a critical Sweat; for when the Blood has a while Boyled, the aduſt Matter being preſently tranſlated to the Brain, dangerous diſorders of the Genus Nervoſum are occaſioned, and convulſive motions of the Tendons, and inflations of the Bowels, like Mother Fits, and ſometimes a Phrenſie, or Delirium, and often a Stupo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and loſs of Speech follow, and the Strength is ſuddenly dejected, almoſt in all, without any manifeſt Cauſe; the Pulſe is weak and unequal, and the Sick ſoon die: And if any chance to eſcape, the flux of the Courſes being reſtored, or a Looſneſs happening, they recover diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly after a long Sickneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="427" facs="tcp:65404:203"/>The acute Diſeaſes of Women in Childbed, are not always according to the manner of the fore-mentioned Fever, but ſometimes they are accompanied with ſome great Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, as with a Quinſie, Pleuriſie, Peripneumonia, Bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy-flux, Small-pox, and the like. Of theſe a Quinſie, Pleuriſie, and Peripneumunia, by reaſon of the great ſimilitude of the Cauſe and analogy of the Cure, may be conſidered together. Preſently at their firſt beginning, we muſt endeavour, that the Blood fixed any where, and beginning to be Extravaſated, be reſtored to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, leſt an Impoſthume ſhould be occaſioned; wherefore internal Remedies, which free the Blood from Coagulation, muſt be uſed, of which ſort are Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks abounding with Volatile Salt, as Spirit of Harts-horne and Soot, Urin, alſo Teſtaceous, and Bezoartick Powders, Lapis Prunella, Decoctions and Juleps, made of Vegetables that force Urine and the Courſes; with all which muſt be mixed ſuch things as have been found by Experience to have been proper for Uterine Diſeaſes. Moreover Diſcutient Medicines, which diſperſe the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Impacted, ſuch are Liniments, Fomentations and Cataplaſms, muſt be carefully applied to the Parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: In the mean while the violent Motion and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Efferveſcence of the Blood muſt be driven far from thence, and the Filth muſt be driven, as much as poſſible, downwards. To this end Frictions, Ligatures, Epiſpaſticks, and if there be occaſion, Cupping-glaſſes muſt be applied about the Legs and Feet; if the Diſeaſe be very violent, Bleeding is indicated, and unleſs there be a Plethora in the whole Body, and the Inflammation be very acute in the Part affected, it will be beſt to open a Vein in the Foot, or to apply Leeches to the Hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoidal Veins: But if neceſſity urge we may Bleed in the Arm, and afterwards, if it can be admitted, in the Foot. But you muſt take notice, that Bleeding muſt be cautiouſly uſed in theſe Caſes; for unleſs it does good, which I have ſeldom found, the Sick is in worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Pulſe being thereby rendred weaker.</p>
                  <p>A Diſſentery is very often deadly, and ſo much the rather becauſe ſuch things as qualifie the Blood, and that moderately bind are Indicated; but the flux of the Lochia forbid the uſe of them. Wherefore in this caſe
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:65404:204"/>
till ſhe has been well Purged by a long flux of the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, the fierceneſs of the Symptoms muſt at preſent be only appeaſed.</p>
                  <p>The Indications of the Small-pox are not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe above-deſcribed, but alſo to one another; for the flux of the Lochia muſt be moderately reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but in the mean while the Effloreſcence of the Blood and gentle Sweating muſt be continued: For ſeeing a twofold venomous Ferment is in this Diſeaſe, and the corrupt Particles of the Blood are to be carried out two ways, we muſt take care that the leaſt and narroweſt Paſſage do not draw all the Matter, or more than it can let out. Wherefore, leſt the Lochia flowing plentifully ſhould turn inward the Venom that is inclined to go off by Sweat, the courſe of Diet muſt be ſomewhat chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and firſt ſuch things as are of an Alexipharmick and aſtringent nature muſt be boyled with their Broaths, as the Roots of Tormentil and Biſtort, alſo Powders, Juleps and Electuaries endued with ſuch Vertues muſt be given at due Intervals; and in this caſe the Woman muſt be no ways allowed Fleſh, or the Broath of it, not muſt ſhe Riſe, but ſhe muſt be kept as quiet as is poſſible, and the whole Buſineſs muſt be left in a manner to God and Nature.</p>
                  <p>All Women in Child-bed have an inbred Venom, and they ought to be careful of it, and to avoid it as much as the greateſt Malignity. Wherefore they ought to uſe an exact courſe of Diet, whereby the Impurities of the Blood and Humours may be purged in Child-bed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the danger of a Fever; and that the diſorders of the Womb may be heal'd, and their ſtrength, weakned by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, may be reſtored: To which end three things are to be minded; Firſt, An exact courſe of Diet muſt be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <hi>viz.</hi> That they be fed for a Week at leaſt with Water-Gruel, ſometimes made with Beer, ſometimes made with Water mix'd with Whitewine, or with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, and other things of eaſie Digeſtion. Secondly, They muſt take great care that they do not catch Cold, whereby the Pores and the Lochia may be ſtopt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let them continue in Bed, at leaſt till the Tenth day. Thirdly, The Lochia muſt be gently provoked; to this end Midwives, when after hard Labour, there is
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:65404:204"/>
danger of a ſtoppage of the Lochia; give Sperma Caeti, Iriſh Slates Powdered, or White Wine tinctured with Saffron, and they make the Gruel with Water and White Wine, wherein, as alſo in Poſſet Drink, they Boyl Marygold Flowers, the Leaves of Penny-royal or Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CXIII. Of Childrens Diſeaſes. Of ordering them; and of the Choice of a Nurſe.</head>
                  <p>A Child, which during the ſtay in its Mother's Belly, had no other Nouriſhment, but the Blood it recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the umbilical Veſſels, hath for want of that after its Birth, need to take ſome by the Mouth, and Suck Breaſt-Milk; however, it is not good to give it Suck, as ſoon as it is Born, to prevent that ſo ſudden a Change, as well in reſpect of the difference of Nouriſhment, as the manner of receiving it, leſt it cauſe ſome alteration in its Health. Firſt therefore empty the Phlegm out of its Stomach, by giving it the firſt three or four days ſome Wine and Sugar to cut and looſen it, to prevent the Milk he ſhall take from Corrupting, it being mixed with this viſcous Phlegm; wherefore it is beſt to ſtay until the next day before you give it Suck.</p>
                  <p>It were to be wiſhed that the Mother ſhou'd not give it Suck until the Eighth day of her Child-bed at ſooneſt, and it is beſt if ſhe ſtay three Weeks or a Month, for in that time ſhe will be well Purged by the Lochia, and the Blood will be much more pure; beſides the ſmall holes of the Nipples are not at firſt ſufficiently opened, and therefore it is neceſſary for a Woman to Suck firſt.</p>
                  <p>But often poor People cannot obſerve ſo many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, and ſuch Mothers are obliged to give their Children Suck from the firſt day; and likewiſe others will not ſuffer any but themſelves to do it. In this caſe let her Breaſts be a little drawn by ſome old Woman,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:65404:205"/>
or ſome luſty ſucking Child, or they may Draw them themſelves.</p>
                  <p>If the Nurſe has much Milk, ſhe muſt not give the Child any thing elſe, at leaſt the firſt two Months. As to the quantity of Milk the Child ought to ſuck, it muſt be proportionable to his Age and Strength; in the beginning he muſt not ſuck too much, nor too often, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by little and little let it be daily augmented, until he may take his fill; but he may ſuck at any time night or day.</p>
                  <p>After the Child has ſuck'd two or three Months, more or leſs, according as one finds he needs ſtronger Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, give him then Pap made of Flower and Milk, though but little at firſt, and not too thick, leſt his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach may be overcharged. When the Child has taken Pap thus made, which muſt be but once a day, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Morning, or twice at moſt, the Nurſe may give it a little ſuck, to the end that being waſhed down into the Stomach, the Digeſtion may be the better and eaſier made.</p>
                  <p>There are many Women who give their Children Pap as ſoon as they are Born, and Nurſes who have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Milk, ordinarily do ſo to hinder their Crying, as they will do when they are Hungry: But ſometimes this of it ſelf is enough to kill them, becauſe of the Indigeſtion and Obſtruction it occaſions, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its groſs and viſcous conſiſtence can ſcarce find Paſſage through the Stomach and Guts, which at the beginning are weak and not ſufficiently opened and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, whereby there happens to Children great Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, difficulty of Breathing, Gripes, Swellings, Pains of the Belly, and often Death. Wherefore do not give it the Child, till after the firſt or ſecond Month at ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and if you forbore it three or four Months he would thrive the better, provided the Nurſe does not want Milk.</p>
                  <p>When he is in the Cradle, let it be ſo turned as it may be towards the Fire, the Candle, or the Chamber Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, that having the Light directly in its Face, he may not be allured to look continually on one ſide; for doing ſo often, his Sight will be ſo perverted, that he will grow Squint-ey'd. Wherefore for the better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:65404:205"/>
throw ſome Covering over the head of the Cradle.</p>
                  <p>Many Children are ſo Grip'd that they can't forbear Crying night nor day, and ſome die ſo, and this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often the firſt and moſt common Diſeaſe that happens to little Infants after their Birth.</p>
                  <p>To remedy all theſe Pains which Women generally call Gripes, reſpect muſt be had to their different Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: As to that which is the general cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The too ſudden change of the Nouriſhment, you muſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear giving the Child Suck till the next day, leſt the Milk being mix'd with the Phlegm which is in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach corrupt; and at firſt it muſt Suck but little until it be accuſtom'd to digeſt it, if it be the <hi>Maeconion</hi> of the Inteſtines, which by its long ſtay cauſes theſe Pains, for to help to diſcharge them of it, give them inwardly a little Oyl of ſweet Almonds and Syrup of Roſes; and to provoke it further, give it beets-Stalk cover'd with Hony for a Suppoſitory, or a Sugar'd Almond alſo dip'd in common Honey, or you may give a ſmall Gliſter.</p>
                  <p>And when the Child is Grip'd, give no Pap, becauſe this Food by its Viſcoſity, eaſily cauſes Obſtructions, which afterwards ingender Wind. If the Pain be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by Worms, lay a Cloath dipp'd in Oyl of Worm-wood mix'd with Ox Gall upon the Belly, or a ſmall Cataplaſm mix'd with Powders of Rue, Wormwood, Coloquintida, Aloes, and the Seeds of Citrons incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with Ox-gall and Flower of Lupines; and to drive them downwards if the little Infant can take any thing by the Mouth, give it a ſmall infuſion of Rubarb, or half an Ounce of Compound Syrup of Succory, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before given a ſmall Gliſter of Sugar'd Milk.</p>
                  <p>When the Gripes are cauſed by Wind, as it often happens, or by ſharp Humours in the Guts, anoint the Child's Belly all over with Oyl of Violets, or elſe with Oil of ſweet Almonds, or elſe with the Oyls of Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts, Camomel and Melilot, mixed together, having firſt warm'd them, in which alſo a Cloath may be dipp'd to lay upon it, and a little Anodyne, or Carminative Gliſter may be given.</p>
                  <p>Very frequently the Milk of a Nurſe that is red Hair'd, given to Wine, or very Amorous, may by its heat and acrimony, cauſe ſmall Ulcers in an Infant's
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:65404:206"/>
Mouth, which are called Apthae, or the Thruſh; and Vulgarly Cancers: Sometimes alſo though the Milk have no ill Quality in it ſelf, it may however corrupt in the Stomach, becauſe of its Weakneſs, or for ſome other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe Ulcers ſome are benign, as they are cauſed by a ſimple heat of the Nurſes Milk, or by the Child's Blood and Humours being a little Over-heated, or alſo from having had a ſmall Fit of a Fever, and they are then very ſuperficial, of a ſmall continuance, and eaſily yielding to Remedies: Others are Malignant, ſuch as are cauſed by a Venereal Venom, or that happen after a Malignant Fever, and are Scorbutick; theſe are putrid, corroſive and ſpreading, and do not only poſſeſs the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rficies of the Membranes, which cover the Roof of the Mouth and Tongue, but make deep Scabs, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the internal Parts of the Throat, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal ones eſpecially, which can never be Cured by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Remedies, but muſt be handled with Specificks, without which they ever augment, and ſoon kill little Infants, who are too weak to undergo the Remedies fit for their Cure.</p>
                  <p>To Cure theſe Ulcers, when they are ſmall and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out malignity, you muſt take care to temper the Nurſe's Milk, preſcribing her a Cooling Diet; Bleeding and Purging alſo if there be occaſion, and waſh the Child's Mouth with Barly or Plantain Water, and Hony of Roſes, or Syrup of dryed Roſes, mixing with them a little Verjuice, or Juice of Limons, as well to looſen and cleanſe the viſcous Humours, which cleave to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Child's Mouth, as to cool thoſe Parts, which are already over-heated. This may be done by means of a ſmall fine Rag, faſtned to the end of a little Stick, and dipp'd in the Remedy, wherewith the Ulcers may be gently rubb'd, being careful not to put them to too much Pain, leſt by irritating them an Inflammation ſhould be cauſed. The Child's Body muſt be kept open, that the Humours being carried to the lower Parts, ſo many Vapours may not aſcend, as uſually do, when the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the Belly are too long retained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="433" facs="tcp:65404:206"/>If the Ulcers participate of any malignity, let to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Remedies then be uſed, which do the Buſineſs ſpeedily, and as it were in an inſtant. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, touch the Ulcers with Plantain-water, ſharpned with Spirit of Vitriol, taking great care that the Infant ſwallows none of it; and the Remedy muſt be ſo much the ſtronger and ſharper, as the Ulcers are profound and malignant. As ſoon as they have been cauterized with this Water, by only touching them once or twice with it according to their bigneſs, depth or corruption, that no ſharp Seroſities may deſtil upon the parts not yet ulcerated, and upon the Infants Throat, waſh its Mouth with Plantain-water, or with a decoction of Barly, Agrimony and Hony of Roſes, continuing to touch and waſh the Ulcers, as it may be judged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and until you find they ſpread no further. To prevent that in the uſe of theſe ſharp Medicines, not the leaſt portion of them ſhould fall upon the Child's Throat, and that by ſwallowing of them, you may receive no great prejudice. Some chuſe rather to cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terize theſe Ulcers with ſmall Linnen Tents dipt in boiling Oil, and if it ſhould be ſwallowed, it would be no great hurt. It will not be amiſs to punge the ill Humors out of the whole habit of the Child, by giving him half an ounce of ſyrup of Succory with Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb.</p>
                  <p>The Teeth, which were hidden in the Jaws, uſually begin to come forth, not all at a time, but one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, towards the fifth or ſixth Month, ſometimes ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſometimes alſo later; for to effect which, they cut the Gums wherewith they were covered. Then becauſe of the exquiſite ſenſe of thoſe parts, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſo great pains to the Children, that many who were hitherto very well, are now in great danger of their Lives, and often die by reaſon of many miſchievous Accidents, which happen to them at that time. And <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, <hi>When Children begin to breed their Teeth, they are troubled with itching of their Gums, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Convulſions and Looſneſſes, and principally when they breed their Tusks or Dog-teeth, eſpecially thoſe Children who are fat, and full of Humors, and bound.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="434" facs="tcp:65404:207"/>The Dog-teeth, commonly called the Eye-teeth, cauſe more pain to the Child than any of the reſt, becauſe they have a deep Root and a ſmall Nerve, that has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with that which moves the Eye. The Teeth, which are firſt bred, are the Cutting or Foreteeth. The Signs when Children will breed their Teeth, are, when the Gums and Cheeks are ſwelled, they feel a great heat there with an itching, which often makes them put their Fingers in their Mouths to rub them, from whence much Moiſture deſtils into the Mouth, becauſe of the Pain they feel there. The Nurſe in giving them ſuck, finds their Mouths hotter; they are much changed, and cry every moment, and cannot ſleep, or but very little at a time. And one may feel and ſee ſmall points of the Teeth through the Gums, which appear thin and pale on the top, and ſwelled and red on the ſides; and if it happen that the Teeth are a long time 'ere they are cut, or that too many of them cut at a time, there is great danger that the Child will fall into thoſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents mentioned above. In this caſe two things are to be regarded; firſt, to preſerve the Child from the ill Accidents that may happen to it, by reaſon of the great pain: Secondly, to aſſiſt as much as may be the cutting of the Teeth, when they can hardly cut the Gums themſelves.</p>
                  <p>To prevent theſe Accidents, the Nurſe muſt keep a good Diet, and uſe all things that may cool and temper the Milk, that a Fever may not follow the pain of the Teeth, and to hinder the falling of the Humors upon the inflamed Gums, keep the Child's belly always looſe, to which purpoſe give him a gentle Gliſter, if the Belly be bound; but there is commonly no need of it: For at this time the Children are uſually troubled with a Looſeneſs.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond, which helps the cutting of the Teeth, that the Nurſe muſt do from time to time, by gently rubbing the Childs Gums with her Finger; to which end the Child it felf may be uſeful, if they give a little Stick of Liquoriſh to them, or a ſmall piece of a new Wax-candle, which is very good to ſoften the Gums. Coral is alſo often uſed to this purpoſe, and the Teeth of a Wolf. But theſe things that are peculiarly proper,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:65404:207"/>
what they do is by their Solidity and Roughneſs: But if theſe things do no good, the Gums muſt be cut with a Lancet to prevent ill Accidents.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as little Infants are in the leaſt indiſpoſed, they very commonly fall into a Looſeneſs, to which their natural moiſture very much contributes.</p>
                  <p>For the moſt part the Looſeneſs happens to them, by reaſon of the great Pain they have at the cutting their Teeth: It may alſo happen by the vitiouſneſs of the Nurſes Milk. But if the Looſeneſs be not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a Fever, or ſome other Accident, it is not dangerous; but if it continue ſo long, it will not be amiſs to remedy it. For this purpoſe, let the Child ſuck good Milk, and give it a ſlight Infuſion of Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, or a little compound Syrup of Succory; gentle Anodyn Gliſters may be alſo given, made of Milk, yolks of Eggs, and Hony of Violets; and after Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let them be made with Plantain-water, and mix the yolk of an Egg with the Pap. Anoint the Belly with Oil of Quinces, and lay on the Stomach a Compreſs dipt in red Wine, wherein Province Roſes have been boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>Vomiting uſually happens to Children, becauſe they often draw more Milk than their little Stomachs can eaſily contain or digeſt: A Cough does ſometimes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion it, ſo does the ſwathing of the Belly too hard.</p>
                  <p>When the Vomiting is too frequent, it is fit it ſhould be ſtopped; to which end, regard muſt be had to that which cauſes it, as when the Child ſucks more than it ſhould, the Nurſe muſt not give it ſo much, but it muſt ſuck but little at a time, that the Stomach may the eaſier contain and digeſt what it receives. If it be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by an ill quality of the Milk, the Nurſe muſt be changed for a better; if from a Cough, it muſt be helped by things fit to appeaſe it. The Nurſe muſt not dance it rudely, nor rock it fiercely after it has ſucked. Care muſt be likewiſe taken, that it be not too cloſe wrapt, and ſwathed about the Stomach. And it will be very convenient to purge the Infant with a gentle Infuſion of Rhubarb, or with half an ounce of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſyrup of Succory: And after it has been well
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:65404:208"/>
purged, it may take a little ſyrup of Quinces to fortify the Stomach, and a Compreſs dipt in red Wine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Province-roſes, Cinnamon and Cloves have been boiled, may be applied to the region of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
                  <p>Children are ſometimes afflicted with Scabs in the Head and Face, but the courſe of theſe Humors muſt by no means be hindred by driving them inwards; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Evacuation defends little Infants from many ill Diſeaſes; and we ordinarily ſee them, whoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have a long time purged away ſuch Superfluities, to be better in health, after they have caſt forth all this kind of Corruption. But Endeavours muſt be only uſed to hinder the generation of more of theſe ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the Child; wherefore, a healthy Nurſe muſt be provided, whoſe Milk is pure and cool, the Child's Belly muſt be kept open, and purged upon occaſion with a little ſyrup of Roſes or of Succory, that ſo the Humors may not be ſent in too great abundance to the Head, and that the Sanies under the Scabs may not eat and corrode the Skin, and ſo cauſe deep Ulcers; it will not be amiſs alſo to make the Scabs fall off, that there may be a freer vent or iſſue; for which end, freſh But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ordinarly made uſe of to moiſten them, or Oil of ſweet Almonds; afterwards, apply a Cabbage-leaf, and change it twice or thrice a day.</p>
                  <p>As to the choice of a Nurſe, the firſt and principal of all the Qualities in a good Nurſe, is, That ſhe be the own Mother of the Child, as well becauſe of the mutual agreement of their Tempers, as that having much more love for it, ſhe will be much more careful than an hired Nurſe, who ordinarily loves her Nurſe-child but with a feigned and ſeeming Love, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other end or foundation, but the hope of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence ſhe expects for her Hire. Wherefore the true Mother, though not the beſt Nurſe, ſhould ever be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before a Stranger. But becauſe there are ſeveral that either will not, or cannot ſuckle their own Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, there is a neceſſity to provide an other Nurſe, which ſhould be choſen as convenient for the Child, as may be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:65404:208"/>Now as we ſee Trees produce Fruits of a different Taſte, by reaſon of the difference of the nouriſhment, ſo the Health of Children, and ſometimes their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners depend on the nouriſhment they receive at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. For as to the health of the Body, it is well known, it anſwers the Humors that all the Parts are nouriſhed and maintained with, which Humors ever retain the nature of the Food whereof they are engend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: As for the Manners, they ordinarily follow the Temperament, which alſo proceeds from the quality of the Humors, and the Humors from the Food. By this conſequence, as the Nurſe is, ſo will the Child be, by means of the nouriſhment it draweth from her; and in ſucking her, it will draw in both the Vices of her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind. This appears very eaſily in Animals that ſuck a ſtrange Dam, for they always partake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Creature they ſuck; being accordingly, either of a mild or fiercer Nature, or of a ſtronger or weaker Body, which may be noted in the Example of young Lions, tamed by ſucking a domeſtick Animal, as a Cow, a Goat or Aſs; and, on the contrary, a Dog will become more furious or fierce if it ſucks a Wolf.</p>
                  <p>The neceſſary Conditions of a good Nurſe are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally taken from her Age, the time and manner of her Labour, the good conſtitution of all the parts of her Body, and particularly of her Breaſts, from the good Nature of her Milk; and, in fine, from her good Manners.</p>
                  <p>As to her Age, the moſt convenient is from twenty five to thirty five years of Age, becauſe that during this ſpace the Woman is moſt ſtrong, healthy and vigorous: She is not fit before five and twenty, becauſe her Body not having yet acquired all its dimenſions, cannot be ſo robuſt; nor after thirty five, becauſe not having Blood enough in ſo great abundance, ſhe cannot have Milk enough for the nouriſhment of the Child. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſome Women are indifferent good Nurſes from twenty to forty, but very rarely before or after.</p>
                  <p>As to the time and manner of her Labour, it muſt be at leaſt a Month or ſix Weeks after it, that ſo her Milk
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:65404:209"/>
may be throughly purified; becauſe, at that time, her Body is uſually cleanſed of the Lochia, which follows Labour, and the Humors are no longer diſturbed with it; nor muſt it be above five or ſix Months, that ſo ſhe may be able to make an end of Nurſing the Child, that there may be no neceſſity to change her afterwards for another. She muſt not have miſcarried, but have been brought to Bed at her full time of a healthful Son, for it is a mark of a good Conſtitution; and it muſt be her ſecond or third Child, that ſhe may by experience know the better how to tend her Nurſery.</p>
                  <p>As to the healthful Conſtitution of her Body, 'tis the principal thing, and on which almoſt all the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
                  <p>In general, ſhe muſt be very healthful and of a good habit, not ſubject to any Diſtemper; that ſhe be come of Parents that never had the Stone in the Reins and Bladder, nor ſubject to the Gout, King's-evil, Falling-ſickneſs, or any other hereditary Diſeaſe; that ſhe hath no ſpot, nor the leaſt ſuſpicion of any venereal Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; that ſhe have no Scab, Itch, Scald, or any other filth of the like nature; that ſhe be ſtrong, the better to watch and tend the Child in all things neceſſary for it; that ſhe be of a middle Stature, neither too tall nor too low, too fat nor too lean, becauſe a Perſon of ſuch a natural Symmetry performs all the Functions more perfectly, and as is uſually ſaid, <hi>In medio conſiſtit Virtus.</hi> But above all, ſhe muſt not be with Child: Let her be of a ſanguine Complexion, which may be known by her Vermilion Colour, not altogether ſo red, but inclining to white; of a firm Fleſh, not ſoft; ſhe muſt not likewiſe have her Courſes, for that is a Sign that her Blood is too hot, either becauſe her Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſuch, or from an amorous Paſſion, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; neither muſt ſhe be ſubject to the Whites, for ſuch Superfluities are a Sign of a bad habit; ſhe muſt not be red haired, nor marked with red Spots, but her Hair muſt be black, or of a Cheſnut brown: She muſt be well ſhaped, neat in her Cloaths, and comly in her Face, having a ſprightly Eye, and a ſmiling Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: She muſt have good Eyes, ſound and white
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:65404:209"/>
Teeth, not having any rotten or ſpoiled, leſt her breath ſhould ſmell; ſhe ought to have a ſweet Voice to pleaſe and rejoice the Child, and likewiſe ought to have a clear and free Pronunciation, that he may not learn an ill Accent of her, as uſually red-haired have, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo that are very black-haired and white Skins; for their Milk is hot, ſharp and ſtinking, and alſo of an ill Taſte: She muſt not have a ſtrong Breath, as they who have a ſtinking Noſe and bad Teeth, as we have ſaid before, becauſe the Nurſe that conſtantly kiſſes the Child, would infect its Lungs by often drawing in her corrupted Breath: Her Breaſts ought to be pretty big, to receive and concoct there a ſufficient quantity of Milk, but not big to exceſs; they muſt be ſound and free from Scars proceeding from former Impoſtumes; they muſt be indifferent firm and fleſhy, and not flaggy and hanging: The Nurſe muſt be broad-breaſted; as to the Nipples they muſt be well ſhaped, they muſt not be too big nor too hard, nor griſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor ſunk in too deep, but they muſt be a little rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and of a moderate bigneſs and firmneſs, and with many little holes, that the Child may not take too much Pains to draw the Milk.</p>
                  <p>The quantity of the Milk muſt be ſufficient for the Child's nouriſhment, it muſt be of a middle conſiſtence, neither too wateriſh nor too thick, which may be eaſily judged, if the Nurſe milking ſome into her Hand, and turning it a little on one ſide, it immediately runs off; but if it remains fixed, without running by turning of the Hand, it is a Mark it is too thick and viſcous. As to the colour, the whiteſt is beſt; it muſt taſte and ſmell ſweet and pleaſant.</p>
                  <p>The Nurſe muſt not be ſubject to Choler nor be quarelſome; ſhe muſt not be melancholy, but merry and chearful, ſmiling often to divert the Child: She muſt be ſober, not given to Wine, and yet le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to the exceſs of Venery; but ſhe may moderately uſe the firſt, and not totally abſtain from the ſecond, if her Nature requires it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="440" facs="tcp:65404:210"/>If a Nurſe has all, or moſt part of theſe Conditions here ſpecified, as well reſpecting her Perſon as Manners, and that ſhe maintains this condition by a Diet fit for the Childs Temperament, and not contrary to her own, there is then great reaſon to believe ſhe is fit to make a very good Nurſe, and to bring up, in perfect Health, the Son of a Prince.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CXIV. Of the Rickets.</head>
                  <p>THIS Diſeaſe began about fifty years ago in the Weſt of <hi>England:</hi> It is a Diſeaſe of Children, and it ſeizes them when they are about half a year old.</p>
                  <p>The Diagnoſtick of this Diſeaſe, as of all others, depends upon the knowledge of the Symptoms, which follow.</p>
                  <p>The proportion of the parts is irregular, <hi>viz.</hi> the Head is bigger than ordinary, ſo is the Face, the Wit is ſharper than is uſual at ſuch an Age, the external Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, eſpecially the Muſcular, are thin and waſted, the Skin is looſe and flaccid, the Bones moſt commonly bowed, and about, the Joins ſticking out and knotty, the Spine is variouſly bent, the Breaſt is narrow and ſharp, the extremity of the Ribs knotty, the Belly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſwelled and ſtiff. Theſe things are obſerved out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
                  <p>As to the inner Parts, the Liver is larger than uſual, ſo are all the Parenchyma, the Stomach and Bowels are larger than in thoſe that are well, the Meſentery is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Glandules that are larger than ordinary, if they are not Scrophulous; theſe things are obſerved in the Belly.</p>
                  <p>In the Breaſt the Lungs are ſtuffed and ſwelled, they are ſometimes purulent and ſcrophulous, and often ſtick to the Pleura, the jugular Veins and the carotid Arteries
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:65404:210"/>
are ſometimes larger than they ſhou'd be, but the Brain is only peccant in bigneſs.</p>
                  <p>To theſe are added a weakneſs of almoſt all the parts and unwillingneſs to move, for ſuch Children will play only ſitting and do not care to ſtand, and at length in progreſs of the Diſeaſe, the Head can ſcarce be ſuſtain'd by the weak neck.</p>
                  <p>As to the Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe, moſt commonly 'tis not deadly; but ſometimes the Symptoms growing to a heighth, it degenerates into a Conſumption, Hectic Fever, Dropſie of the Lungs or an Aſcitis, and ſo at laſt is deadly; but the Prognoſtick may be eaſier inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the following Rules.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if this Diſeaſe invades before the Birth, or preſently after, 'tis very dangerous, and moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deadly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſooner it comes the worſe 'tis.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the more violent the Symptoms are, <hi>viz.</hi> if the Parts are very much diſproportion'd and much waſted, the Cure is the more difficult.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if this Diſeaſe is accompanied with the foreſaid Diſeaſes, it can ſcarce ever be cur'd.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, thoſe that are not cured before they are five years of Age, are ever after ſickly.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, an Itch coming upon this Diſeaſe, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to the Cure.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, in thoſe the Symptoms are not increaſed, but rather leſſened, the Cure need not be doubted.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, we muſt begin with Purging, becauſe moſt commonly there is abundance of ſlegmatick Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors heapt up in the Belly, and the Bowels are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently affected with ſcrophulous Tumors; but Purging is to be inſtituted by Gliſters, Vomits and lenitive Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks.</p>
                  <p>The uſe and forms of ſome Gliſters.</p>
                  <p>If the Belly be bound, or the Bowels are troubl'd with Wind or Gripes, Gliſters muſt be us'd frequently, which muſt not be only ſolutive, but ſometimes alterative and corroborative. For inſtance:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the leaves of Mallows, one handful, of the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Melilot, Camomile and Elder, each one pugil,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:65404:211"/>
of the ſeeds of Anniſe and Fennel bruis'd, each half a drachm; boil them in a ſufficient quantity of new Goat's Milk, to four, five or ſix ounces of the ſtrain'd Liquor; add of red Sugar and of ſyrup of Violets and Roſes, each one ounce: Make a Gliſter, inject it warm a good while after Eating.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the roots of Marſhmallows bruis'd, half an ounce, of the leaves of Mallows and Pellitory, each half an handful, of the flowers of Camomil and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, each one pugil, of the Carminative ſeeds, two drachms; boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Poſſet-drink to 5 or 6 ounces of the ſtrained Liquor; add of Lenitive Electuary, or of Diacaſſia half an ounce, of freſh Butter ſix drachms; mingle them, to be inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted warm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Corroborative Gliſters may be made in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of freſh Stone-Horſe dung, one ounce and an half, of the flowers of Roſemary and Sage, each one pugil, of Juniper-berries, two drachms, of the ſeeds of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe, Fennel, each half a drachm; infuſe them cloſe and warm in a ſufficient quantity of Whey, in four ounces of the ſtrained Liquor, diſſolve one ounce of brown Sugar and ſix drachms of freſh Butter; min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle them, make a Gliſter: There may alſo be added, if it ſeem convenient, ſix drachms of Manna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Millepides waſhed number 20 or 30, bruiſe them, and pour upon them 4 or 5 ounces of Poſſet-drink made of white Wine, in the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve an ounce of brown Sugar, and a drachm of Venice-Turpentine diſſolved in the yolk of an Egg; mingle them, make a Gliſter to be injected warm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>The uſe of Vomits and Forms of them.</head>
                     <p>If the Stomach be burthened with vitious Humors, and they tend upwards, Vomits muſt be given; but in the preſcription of them, reſpect muſt be had to the tender Age, and they ſhould conſiſt rather of Salt of

                     <p>

                     <p>After gentle Purging, if the Sick be of a ſanguine Conſtitution, Blood-letting is of uſe. Our Empericks uſe to draw a ſmall quantity of Blood by ſcarifying the lobe of the Ear; which operation they rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form with a blunt Knife, than with a ſharp Lancet; and they repeat it twice or thrice, intermitting about the ſpace of 7 days. Altho' Practitioners greatly praiſe this way by Scarification, I do not know but Leeches may be more effectual. Neither do I think it is to be fear'd that the ſucking of Leeches ſhould cauſe a greater afflux of Blood to the Head. For whatever Blood is drawn to the part by their Sucking, is alſo evacuated by it; and as to the greater afflux of Blood, by reaſon of the emptying of the Veſſels, the ſame happens in bleeding by the Lancet.</p>
                     <p>Iſſues are alſo very effectual in this Diſeaſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally an Iſſue made between the firſt and ſecond Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae of the Neck. The uſefulneſs of Iſſues conſiſts in that they are very effectual to evacuate the ſuperfluous feroſity of the Brain, and alſo to leſſen the irregular form of it, and likewiſe to dry up the too great moiſture of the ſpinal Marrow, and conſequently to ſtrengthen the Nerves that ariſe from thence. A Seton may be put in the place of an Iſſue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="446" facs="tcp:65404:213"/>As to Veſicatories, it is not to be doubted, but that they give eaſe being applied upon the Vertebres of the Neck or behind the Ears. But their Strength is ſoon gone, and the uſe of them ſeems to be both troubleſom and painful to Children.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Cupping-glaſſes, without Scarification, apply'd along the Back-bone are very effectual to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the moiſt and cold Temperies of the ſpinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and to remove the dulneſs of the Nerves. And I think alſo that they may be applyed upon the upper Vertebres of the Neck, with a light Scarification.</p>
                     <p>Beſides Purging and Chyrurgical Remedies, Specifick altering Medicines are to be uſed, to which ſometimes Diureticks and Diaphoreticks are to be added; of which we ſhall add ſome Examples.</p>
                     <p>The ſpecifick Remedies, that are found moſt effectual to cure this Diſtemper, are either ſimple or compound; among Simples, the following are moſt approved. Wood of Guiacum and its bark, Saſſafras, Lentiskwood, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, the knotty parts of Firr, the roots of China, of Sarſaparilla, the three Sanders, the roots of Osmund-royal, or rather the Cloves of the roots; the roots of Sea-fern, or rather the buds of them; Graſs-roots, the roots of Aſparagus, Eryngo, Succory, Burdock, the barks of the roots of Cappers; the capillary Herbs, and chiefly Trichomanes, Ceterach, Wall-rue, Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongue, Liverwort, Male-ſpeedwell, Agrimony, Brook-lime, Water-creſſes; the leaves and flowers of Sage, of Roſemary, Betony, dead Nettle and of Tamarisk; alſo Steel prepared, or its Salt or Vitriol. Tartar, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, flowers of Sulphur, Earthworms, Millepides pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and the like.</p>

                        <hi>Take of the Cloves of the roots of Oſmund-royal, of the roots of Burdock, Graſs ſuccory, each one ounce, of the herbs Male-ſpeedwel, Agrimony, Hartſtongue, Liverwort, Maiden-hair, each half an handful, of the raſpings of Ivory and Hartſhorn, each an ounce, of Raiſins of the Sun ſtoned, one ounce; boil them in two quarts of Fountain-water, to the conſumption of a third part, add of White-wine or Rheniſh-wine, half a pint; ſtrain it preſently, and then add to it of the leaves of Water-creſſes and Brooklime, and of the tops of Fir, each half an handful, of Juniper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, half an ounce; make a warm Infuſion in a cloſe Veſſel for about two hours; keep the ſtrained Liquor in a Glaſs well ſtopt, and ſweeten it at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The doſe is two or three ounces at nine in the morning, at three in the afternoon, and ſix in the evening.</hi>

                        <hi>Take of Lignum Lentiſcinum, Roſemary, of the roots of Sarſaparilla, flowering Fern, or of male Fern, each three ounces, of the herbs Agrimony, Maiden-hair, Speedwel, Hartſtongue, Sage, Bettony, each two hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, of the teps of Fern and Tamarisk, each 2 handfuls, boil them in four Gallons of Ale till one is conſumed; when it has done working in the Veſſel, put into a bag 200 Millepides waſhed in Whitewine, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly bruiſed, of Juniper-berries, two ounces, of Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs cut number two, hang the bag in the Veſſel, and put a piece of Steel into it to make it ſink. If there be any ſuſpicion of the Scurvy, you may add of Water-creſſes and Brooklime, each two handfuls; after a fortnight, let it be drunk for the ordinary drink.</hi>

                        <pb n="448" facs="tcp:65404:214"/>But the Medicine which is moſt approved of in this Diſeaſe is <hi>ens veneris,</hi> five or ſix grains of it may be taken every night at bed time, in half a ſpoonful of ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Gillyflowers.</p>
                     <p>If the Lungs are ſtuffed with viſcid Humors, as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens often, and the Meſentery with ſcropholous Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules, Balſam of Sulphur may be given, three or four drops being mixed with Sugar-candy powdered, and taken morning and evening.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the uſe of Steel agrees; but it muſt not be uſed in Coughs, Pleuriſies, a ſtoppage of the Lungs and hectick Fever, and the like.</p>
                     <p>To the foreſaid Remedies are ſometimes added Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticks, as a decoction of Guaiacum or the like, which muſt be taken in Bed, and Sweat muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted according to the ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>The Bath-water alſo is very proper, and is excellent to take off the ſwelling of the Belly. The following artificial Bath is much commended. Place the Sick in a large Veſſel, and put round him warm Barly ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which has been a while infuſed in boiled Water, as is uſually done for making Beer; cover him well, and let him abide in it to provoke ſweat.</p>

                     <head>Of the Symptoms.</head>
                     <p>Regard muſt be had to the Symptoms coming upon this Diſeaſe, the moſt frequent whereof is a Looſneſs; for the Cure whereof gentle Catharticks, as an infuſion of Rhubarb and Tamarinds, and of Sanders, or a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus made of them is of uſe: But ſometimes Aſtringents, and gentle Opiats may be uſed; but Purging and ſometimes Vomiting muſt go before. Sometimes immoderate ſweating afflicts the Child, which if it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a feveriſh Fit, is critical, and ought not to be raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtop'd; but if it flow inordinately, it is a Sign that the Body is oppreſſed with ill Humors; and, therefore, this ſort of Sweat muſt be corrected by a gentle Purge, eſpecially with Rhubarb. A Vomit does alſo good ſometimes in this caſe. Aperitives alſo, and ſuch things as help Concoction, muſt not be omitted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="449" facs="tcp:65404:214"/>Moreover, breeding of the Teeth difficultly is fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to this Diſeaſe, which often occaſions a Fever; in which caſe, gentle Evacuations, eſpecially by Gliſters muſt be made, tho' ſometimes Purging and Vomiting gently are of uſe. If the Tooth be about to pierce the Gum, Nurſes are wont to rub the Gum with a piece of poliſhed Coral; but the roots of Marſhmallows or ſharp pointed Dock will do as well: But ſometimes it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to cut the Gum to make way for the Tooth, and to apply Bliſters behind the Ears; and if there be great pain and watching, Hypnoticks muſt be uſed; as one or two drachms of Diacodium in a ſpoonful of Cowſlip-water.</p>
                     <p>Beſides internal Medicines and chirurgical Helps, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal things alſo muſt be uſed, as Exerciſes of all ſorts, and if the Child be able, walking frequently; if not, he muſt play ſitting, or be carried about in the Nurſes Arms, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Frictions are alſo good in this caſe, with warm Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; the parts to be rubb'd are the Spine, which is primarly affected, and the muſcular Parts; but with this caution, that you muſt not rub the Bones where they ſtick out; but you may rub freely the concave parts of the Bones.</p>
                     <p>Ligatures are alſo of uſe, which are to be made above the Knee and above the Elbow; but they ought to be ſoft and looſe. Boots are alſo of uſe, but you muſt take care that they preſs a little upon the protuberant part of the bone, and ſcarce touch the cavity. Bodice are alſo to be uſed to keep the Body upright. Swinging is alſo neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, we will mention ſome things that are to be applied outwardly. A fomentation of all ſorts of Wine, alſo common Aqua Vitae is very good to corroborate the nervous parts, which muſt be uſed for the weak parts and eſpecially for the Spine; which being done, the parts muſt be anointed with Oil, or ſome proper Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we ſhall mention by and by, and inſtead of Wine, the following Decoction may be uſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the roots of Oſmund-royal, or of male-fern three ounces, of the leaves of Bettony, Sage, Roſemary,
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:65404:215"/>
Marjoram, Water-creſſes, each one handful, of the flower of Camomel, Melilot and Elder, each one pugil, of the berries of Lawrel and Juniper, each half an ounce; boil them in a ſufficient quantity of fountain Water to a quart, add of White-wine, or of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Aqua Vitae, one pint; keep the ſtrained Liquor for uſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the leaves of Elder, Lawrel, Marjoram, Sage, Roſemary, Bettony and the tops of Lavender, each two handfuls, of the berries of Juniper and Lawrel, each one ounce; cut them and bruiſe them, and put them into a Veſſel with three pound of May butter, or of freſh butter not ſalted, and add to them half a pint of Aqua Vitae; boil them to the conſumption of the Aqua Vitae, and while the ſtrained Liquor is hot, add half an ounce of the Oil of Nutmegs by expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and one drachm of Peruvian balſam; mingle them, make an Ointment. Inſtead of May-butter, Beef, Marrow, or Deers Suet, and Oil of Worms or Oil of Foxes, each one pound and an half, may be uſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ointments muſt be applied warm before a hot Fire and naked, with a warm hand, till the parts are dry.</p>
                     <p>If the Belly be hard and ſwelled, the following Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be applied.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Take of the Oils of Cappers, Wormwood and Elder, each one ounce, of the Ointment above deſcribed, one ounce and an half, of Gum Ammoniacum diſſolved in Vinegar, half an ounce, make a Liniment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilſt Ointments are applied to the Hypochondres, the bowels muſt be handled by the Nurſe.</p>
                     <p>If the Lungs are affected, the Breaſt muſt be anointed with the pectoral Ointment, or with the Ointment of Marſh-mallows, or both mixed together; and at the time of Unction a little Oil of Nutmegs by expreſſion may be mixed with it.</p>
                     <p>The Nerve-Plaſter, or a Plaſter of Bettony may be apply'd to the Spine.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CXV. Of the Gout.</head>
                  <p>THe Gout chiefly ſeizes thoſe Old Men, who after they have lived the beſt part of their Lives ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and delicately indulging themſelves freely with ſplendid Banquets, Wine and other ſpiritous Liquors, at length, by reaſon of the ſloth that always accompanies old Age, wholly omit thoſe excerciſes of Body, which young Men are accuſtomed to. Moreover, they who are obnoxious to this Diſeaſe have large Skulls, and are moſt commonly of a groſs habit of Body, moiſt and lax, and of a luſty and luxuriant Conſtitution, the beſt and richeſt foundation for Life.</p>
                  <p>Not that the Gout only ſeizes thoſe that are corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, for ſometimes, though ſeldomer, it invades thin People; nor does it wait always till they are Old, for ſometimes it ſeizes thoſe that are in the flower of their Age, when they have receiv'd the unhappy Seeds of the Diſeaſe from their Parents, as it were <hi>ex traduce:</hi> Or if this be not the cauſe, they have too early us'd Venery, or have quite forſook violent Exerciſes that they us'd formerly. Moreover, they have great Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, and have drank ſpirituous Liquors immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and afterwards they have ſuddenly betook themſelves to thin and cooling Liquors.</p>
                  <p>I will diſcourſe of this Diſeaſe as it proceeds regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and afterwards of its anomalous and uncertain Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena. When the Gout is regular, it ſeizes the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient moſt commonly after this manner, about the latter end of <hi>January,</hi> or at the beginning of <hi>February</hi> it comes ſuddenly and for the moſt part without giving any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, except that the Patient has been troubled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion and crudities of the Stomach for ſome Weeks before. Moreover, the Body is oppreſs'd and puff'd up with Wind, which daily encreaſes till the Fit thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:65404:216"/>
upon him; but a few days before it comes the Thighs are benummed, and there is as it were a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of Wind through them, with convulſive motions; and the day before the Fit the Appetite is ſharp, but not natural. He goes to Bed, and to ſleep well, but at two a clock in the morning is wak'd by the pain, ſeizing either his great Toe, the Heel, the calf of the Leg or the Ankle: This pain is like that of a diſlocated Bone, with the ſenſe as it were of Water almoſt cold, pour'd upon the Membranes of the part affected, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhivering or ſhaking follows, with a feveriſh diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the pain is very gentle but increaſes by degrees, (and in like manner the ſhaking and ſhivering go off) and that hourly, till towards night it comes to its height, accommodating it ſelf neatly according to the variety of the Bones of the Tarſus and Metatarſus the Ligaments, whereof it ſeizes, ſometimes in a manner reſembling a violent ſtretching or tearing thoſe Ligaments, ſometimes the gnawing of a Dog, and ſometimes a Preſſure: Moreover, the part affected has ſuch a quick and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit pain, that 'tis not able to bear the weight of the Cloaths upon it, nor hard walking in the Chamber, and the night is not only paſs'd over in pain upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but alſo by reaſon of the reſtleſs turning hither and thither till two or three a clock in the morning, (<hi>viz.</hi> a night and a day being ſpent from the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Fit) at which time the Sick has ſuddenly eaſe; and now being in a breathing ſweat, he falls aſleep; when he wakes, he finds the pain much abated, and the part affected ſwell'd; the next day, and perhaps two or three days after, if the Matter apt to degenerate the Gout is copious, the part affected will be in pain, but 'twill be eaſed about the Cock's crowing; within a few days the other Foot will be in pain as the former was; and if the former has left off aking, the weakneſs which render'd it infirm, will preſently vaniſh. After it has vext the Feet, the Fits that follow are irregular both as to the time of invaſion and duration, yet the pain always returns in the Evening and is leſs in the Morning; and of a ſeries of theſe ſmall Fits, conſiſts that which is call'd a Fit of the Gout.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="453" facs="tcp:65404:216"/>But when the Gout is diſturb'd by improper Methods, or by the obſtinate continuance of the Diſeaſe, the very ſubſtance of the Body being as it were perverted to the nouriſhment of the Diſeaſe, and Nature unable to eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the ſame by its wonted method, then the Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomina are much different; for whereas the pain was hitherto only troubleſom to the Feet (which are the genuine ſeat of the peccant Matter, and if it poſſeſſes any other parts, 'tis moſt certain that either the method of the Diſeaſe has been alter'd, or that the vigour of the Body is by little and little diminiſh'd;) now it poſſeſſes the Hands, Wriſts, the Arms, the Knees and other Regions, tormenting theſe as much as it us'd to do the Feet; for ſometimes diſtorting one or more of the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, it makes them like a bunch of Parſhips, taking away the motion by degrees, and at length it generates ſtony Concretions about the Ligaments of the Joints, ſometimes the Matter occaſioning the Diſeaſe thruſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Arms cauſes a whitiſh ſwelling almoſt as big as an Egg, which is by degrees inflam'd; ſometimes fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Thigh, it feels as if there were a great weight hanging upon it, yet without any conſiderable pain; but, paſſing to the Knee, it handles that more ſeverely.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Gout before did not uſe to invade before the latter end of Winter, and was wont to go off after two or three Months, now it continues upon the Sick a whole year, excepting only two or three of the hot Months.</p>
                  <p>The Sick is alſo afflicted with many other Symptoms, as with a pain of the Hemorrhoidal Veins, and with unſavory Belchings, and upon Yawning, eſpecially in the morning, the Ligaments of the Bones of the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarſus are violently pull'd; and ſometimes when Yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing does not go before, the Sick juſt dropping aſleep, ſuddenly feels a blow, as it were, of a Club breaking in pieces the Metatarſus.</p>
                  <p>Women are very ſeldom troubled with the Gout, and if they are, not till they are old, or unleſs they are of a maſculine habit of Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="454" facs="tcp:65404:217"/>As to the Cure, Bleeding, Purging and Sweating are not indicated; but the Intention of curing is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the helping Concoction. Whatſoever, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, aſſiſts Nature in duly performing her Offices, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in comforting the Stomach that it may rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct the nouriſhment, or the Blood that it may well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulate the Chile brought into it, or the ſolid Parts that they may the better convert it to their proper ſubſtance, the Juices deſigned for their nouriſhment and increaſe. Laſtly, whatever preſerves the various Organs of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and the Emunctories of the Body in ſuch a ſtate, as that they may be able to diſcharge duly and orderly the Excrements of each part: This, and ſuch like, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the anſwering this intention, and are properly called Digeſtives, whether they are Medicines or a courſe of Diet, or Exerciſe, or any other of thoſe things which are called the ſix Non-naturals.</p>
                  <p>Medicines of this kind are thoſe in general which moderately heat, and are bitter, or gently bite the Tongue; for they are very agreeable to the Stomach, they purify the Blood and comfort all the Parts. The Remedy which I uſe, is made in the following man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the roots of Angelica, ſweet-ſmelling Flag, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-wort, Elecampane, leaves of common Wormwood, the leſſer Centaury, white Horehound, Germander, Groundpine, Scordium, Calaminth, meadow Saxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, S. John's-wort, golden Rod, Feverfew, Thyme, Mint, Sage, Rue, Carduus Benedictus, Penny-royal, Southern-wood, of the flowers of Camomil, Tanſie, Lilly of the Vallies, Engliſh Saffron, of the ſeeds of Treacle, Muſtard, Garden ſcurvy-graſs, Carraways, Juniper-berries, each a ſufficient quantity; let the herbs and flowers, and roots be gathered when they have moſt vertue in them; let them be dried, and kept in Paper-bags till they may be finely powdered: To ſix ounces of each well mixed, add a ſufficient quantity of purified Hony and Canary-wine, to make an Electuary: Take two drachms morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Or for want of this, uſe the following.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="455" facs="tcp:65404:217"/>
                     <hi>Take of conſerve of Garden-ſcurvygraſs, an ounce and an half, of Roman Wormwood and of the yellow rind of Oranges, each one ounce, of candied Angelica, and of Nutmegs candied, each half an ounce, of Venice Treacle, three drachms, of compound Powder of Wake robin, two drachms; make an Electuary, with a ſufficient quantity of ſyrup of Oranges; let him take two drachms twice a day, drinking upon it five or ſix ſpoonfuls of the following water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the roots of Horſe-radiſh ſliced, three ounces, of Garden-ſcurvygraſs, twelve handfuls, of Water-creſſes, Brooklime, Sage and Mint, each four hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls, the peels of ſix Oranges, two Nutmegs bruiſed, of Brunſwick Mum, ſix quarts; diſtil them in a common Still, and draw only ſix pints of Water for uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the Medicines commonly known, Venice-Treacle is the beſt; but becauſe it contains a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Species that heat too much, and beſides a great deal of Opium, the Electuary above-mentioned may be more commodiouſly prepared of the chief heating Vegetables; but we muſt take care to chuſe ſuch Simples as are pleaſant to the taſte, for the Sick muſt take it a long while, <hi>viz.</hi> almoſt as long as he lives.</p>
                  <p>Among the Simples, the Peruvian-bark is the beſt; for it ſtrengthens the Blood and renders it vigorous, if ſome Grains of it are taken morning and evening.</p>
                  <p>A Mediocrity is to be obſerved in Meat and Drink, ſo that neither more nouriſhment be taken in than the Stomach can concoct: Nor, on the contrary, muſt the Parts by too much Abſtinence, be defrauded of that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby their Strength and Vigour ought to be ſuſtained. Morever, as to the quality of the Meat, though things of eaſy digeſtion conſidered by themſelves are to be preferred before things of hard digeſtion, yet regard muſt be had to the Patient's Palat; for we muſt take notice, That that which the Stomach earneſtly craves for, though of difficult digeſtion, is ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted by Nature, than that which is accounted to be
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:65404:218"/>
of eaſier digeſtion, if it be offenſive to the Stomach; but thoſe things that are reckoned of hard digeſtion, are therefore to be eaten more ſparingly: And, I ſuppoſe, the Patient ought to feed upon one ſort of Meat at a meal; for various ſorts of Fleſh eaten at once, diſturb the Stomach more than one ſort eaten in the ſame quantity; as to other things beſides Fleſh, let him eat at pleaſure, if they are not ſharp, nor ſalted, nor ſpiced.</p>
                  <p>As to the times of eating, a Dinner is only neceſſary, for the Bed being moſt proper to digeſt the Humors, that time ought not to be waſted about concocting the Meat; therefore, they that are ſubject to the Gout ſhould not eat Suppers, yet they may allow themſelves a large draught of ſmall Beer; for ſuch are inclinable to breed the Stone in the Kidnies, the concretion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is much hindred by ſuch kind of Liquor drunk at this time, the Reins being cooled and cleanſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                  <p>The drinking of Milk or a Milk-diet, either crude or boiled without any thing elſe, except perhaps a piece of Bread with it once a day, has been much uſed this 20 years, and it has done more good to many than any other ſort of Remedy for this Diſeaſe, as long as they kept to it; but as ſoon as they return to common Diet, though of eaſy digeſtion, the Gout returned more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently than before, and held them longer; therefore, he that intends to betake himſelf to this method, ought, firſt, to conſider ſeriouſly whether he can perſiſt in the uſe of it all his Life long, which perhaps is not in his power, how reſolved ſoever he may be. For I knew a Noble Man, who after he had been dieted with Milk only a whole year with pleaſure (all which time he went to Stool daily once or oftner) was forced to leave it off by reaſon he was ſuddenly bound in Body, and the temper of his Body altered, and becauſe at length his Stomach nauſeated Milk, tho' the inclination of his Mind ſtill continued; but ſome Hypochondriacal Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a groſs habit of Body, or who otherwiſe have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed themſelves much and a long while to ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Liquors, can by no means bear a Milk-diet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="457" facs="tcp:65404:218"/>As to Liquors, thoſe in my opinion are beſt, that are neither as ſtrong as Wine nor as weak as Water, of which ſort is our <hi>London</hi> ſmall Beer, either with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hops, for extreams on either hand are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>But now though it may be ſufficient for him that has the Gout but little and at ſometimes only, to uſe ſmall Beer and diluted Wine, the degree of his Diſeaſe not requiring more ſevere uſage; yet when the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Body is as it were degenerated into the Gout, he will be leſs able to conquer the Diſeaſe, who does not wholly abſtain from any ſort of fermented Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors though ſmall and mild; therefore, a dietetick Drink muſt be preſcribed for his ordinary Drink. The following pleaſes me beſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Sarſaparilla, ſix ounces, of Saſſafras, China and the ſhavings of Hartſhorn, each two ounces, of Liquoriſh, one ounce; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Liquor is moſt conveniently us'd at firſt when the Patient recovers of the Fit, and he muſt perſevere in the uſe of it all the reſt of his Life, as well when he has the Fits as at other times; at the ſame time the foreſaid Electuary muſt be us'd daily, as well in the Fits as when they are off.</p>
                  <p>Yet if the Sick, by reaſon of a long and too great uſe of intoxicating Liquors, or by reaſon of old Age or Weakneſs cannot concoct his Meat without Wine or ſome other fermented Liquor, he cannot leave it off ſuddenly without great danger, the doing whereof has been fatal to very many; therefore, in my Opinion, he ſhou'd not uſe the dietetick Apozem at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="458" facs="tcp:65404:219"/>The Sick muſt go to bed early; for beſides Bleeding and Purging, nothing does ſo much deſtroy the ſtrength of Nature as watching a-nights.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Tranquility of Mind muſt by all means be obtain'd; but the exerciſe of the Body is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable than all other things that are us'd to hinder the indigeſtion of the Humors, and to corroborate the Blood and to reſtore ſtrength to the parts; but unleſs 'tis uſed daily 'twill do no good, yet it muſt not be violent. As to the kind of Exerciſe, riding on Horſeback, when old Age and the Stone do not hinder, is much to be preferr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d before the reſt; if this cannot be uſed, riding in a Coach does almoſt as well: And on this account, at leaſt, it is well with gouty People, for their Riches, which enticed them to Luxury, whereby the Diſeaſe was bred, can provide them a Coach, which kind of exerciſe they may uſe, when they cannot the other: But it is to be obſerved, that it is beſt to uſe exerciſe in a good Air, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Country, and not in the City, where the Air is filled with Vapors exhaling from the Shops of various Artificers, and thickned by the cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Buildings, as it is here in <hi>London,</hi> which is generally ſuppoſed to be the largeſt City in the whole World.</p>
                  <p>As to Venery, old and gouty People muſt not indulge themſelves in it.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding what has been ſaid of the uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of exerciſe in the Fits of the Gout; if the Sick, by reaſon of the violence of the Fit is as it were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed preſently by the firſt aſſault of it, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to thoſe, for the moſt part, in whom the Gout has now come to its height, nor is yet grown gentle by a courſe of many years; In this caſe, if the Sick is confined to a Chamber, it will alſo be convenient that he keep his bed for ſome of the firſt days, till the violence of the pain is abated; for the bed does ſomewhat ſupply the want of Exerciſe: For the continual uſe of it does more powerfully digeſt the morbiſick Matter in a few days, than keeping up in many, eſpecially at the beginning of the Diſeaſe, if the Sick can abſtain from Fleſh without fainting or other ill Symptoms, and can be contented only with Barly-broath, ſmall Beer, and the like. But
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:65404:219"/>
you muſt take notice, that if the Gout is inveterate and inclines the Sick to Fainting, Gripes and Looſneſs, and ſuch kind of Symptoms, he will ſcarce avoid being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by one of the Fits, if he do not uſe Exerciſe in a free and open Air; for a great many gouty People, periſh by theſe Symptoms, whereunto they have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious by being confin'd to their Chambers, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to their Beds, whereas had they bore the fatigue of riding in a Coach the greateſt part of the day, they had not died ſo ſoon.</p>
                  <p>But as to the Symptoms of the Gout, we muſt apply our ſelves to thoſe whereby the Life of the Patient is endangered, <hi>viz.</hi> the debility and faintneſs of the Stomach with Gripes of the Belly; for the Sickneſs and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a ſmall draught of Canary Wine is very good.</p>
                  <p>But if any great Symptom, ſcarce bearing a truce, comes ſuddenly, by reaſon of ſtriking in of the gouty Matter, and threatens Death, we muſt neither truſt to the Wine nor to the Exerciſe above commended; but in this caſe, if it does not fall upon the Head, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the natural or vital Parts, we muſt preſently fly to Laudanum, <hi>viz.</hi> give 20 drops of liquid Laudanum, mixed with a ſmall draught of Epidemick Water, and let the Patient compoſe himſelf to reſt in his Bed. But if the Matter occaſioning the Gout produces a Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe it is not yet caſt upon the Limbs, if it be not the criſis of a particular Fit, and if notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Laudanum above commended, and Exerciſe of all ſorts (for theſe muſt be firſt uſed for the cure of the Diarrhaea) the Looſneſs continues accompanied with Sickneſs and Gripes, there is only one Remedy that I know of, <hi>viz.</hi> to provoke Sweat by a method, and Medicines deſigned for this uſe, which if it be done two or three days, Morning and Evening, for two or three hours at a time, it moſt commonly ſtops the Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and forces the Diſeaſe upon the Limbs.</p>
                  <p>There is another Symptom not ſo frequent, though I have ſeen it divers times, <hi>viz.</hi> a tranſlation of the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Matter upon the lobes of the Lungs, when a Winter-cough, by reaſon of cold taken in the time of the Fit, has by degrees drawn the Matter upon the Lungs. In this one caſe, the curative Indication is not to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:65404:220"/>
to the Gout, but this Symptom is to be treated as a true Peripneumonia, by Bleeding repeated, and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thickning Remedies and Diet. Moreover, the Sick muſt be purged betwixt the Bleedings; but Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing does hurt in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, it is to be noted, That almoſt all gouty People, when they have been conflicted a long while with this Diſeaſe, are ſubjected to the Stone in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, moſt commonly at the declination of a general Fit. In this caſe, ſetting aſide all other Medicines, let him preſently take a Gallon of Poſſet-drink, wherein two ounces of the roots of Marſhmallows have been boiled, and let the following Gliſter be injected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the roots of Marſhmallows and Lillies, each one ounce, of the leaves of Mallows, Pellitory of the Wall, Bears-breech, and of the flowers of Camomil, each one handful, of Flax and Fenugreek-ſeeds, each half an handful; boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Water; diſſolve in the ſtrained Liquor, of brown Sugar and ſyrup of Marſhmallows, each two ounces; mingle them, and make a Gliſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As ſoon as he has rendred all the Poſſet-drink by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, and has ejected the Gliſter, let him take a large doſe of liquid Laudanum, <hi>viz.</hi> 25 drops, or 15 grains of <hi>Mathew</hi>'s Pill.</p>
                  <p>If any one inquires for external Remedies to eaſe the pain of the Gout, I have hitherto known none, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things meerly cooling and repelling, which are very dangerous; and I confidently affirm, That the greateſt part of thoſe who have periſhed in the Gout, have not ſo properly been killed by the Diſeaſe, as by an improper uſe of Medicines; therefore, if the pain be very violent, it will be better for the Sick to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a bed till the pain is a little abated, than to uſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Anodynes. But it will not be amiſs to take a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Laudanum in the Evening, if the pain is intollerable, otherwiſe it will be better to omit it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CXVI. Of a Rheumatiſm.</head>
                  <p>THIS Diſeaſe comes at any time, but eſpecially in the Autumn, and it chiefly ſeizes thoſe that are in the flower of their Age, and it begins moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly upon the following occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sick catches Cold after having been much heated with violent Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, or any other way. It begins with Shaking, and Shivering and Heat, Reſtleſſneſs, Thirſt, and the other unhappy train of Symptoms which accompany Fevers, follow, after a day or two, and ſometimes ſooner, the Sick is ſeized with a violent pain ſometimes in one Limb, ſometimes in another in the Wriſts, Shoulders, Knees eſpecially, which changing place, ſeizes them by turns, redneſs and ſwelling remaining in the part which was laſt affected.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſort of this Diſeaſe, though it is commonly thought of another kind, it may be properly called Lumbago Rheumatica, <hi>viz.</hi> a violent and fixed pain about the region of the Loins, which ſometimes reaching to the Os ſacrum, reſembles the Stone in the Kidnies, only the Sick does not vomit. This violent pain, unleſs it be removed in the ſame manner the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is, laſts as long, and is full as painful.</p>
                  <p>Having ſeriouſly conſidered that this Diſeaſe ariſes from an Inflammation, I thought it was probable it might be cured by a ſimple cooling Diet moderately nouriſhing, as well as by Bleeding repeated, and a Whey-diet I found did as well as Bleeding.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Malthus,</hi> an Apothecary, an honeſt and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man, was ſeized violently with a Rheumatiſm; and becauſe he was of a weakly and dry habit of Body, I was afraid he would not be able to bear large Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore I ordered, That he ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted with Whey alone for four days: Afterwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:65404:221"/>
the Whey, I allowed him white Bread for Dinner; being contented with this Diet, he continued it for 18 days, only at laſt he eat Bread for Supper alſo. He drank daily four quarts of Whey; afterwards, when he went abroad, he eat Chicken, and other things of eaſy digeſtion; but every third day he was dieted with Whey only, till he was quite well.</p>
                  <p>But how well ſoever a Whey-diet may agree with young People, and with thoſe that live temperately, it is not ſafe to treat old People ſo, or ſuch as have too much addicted themſelves a long while to Wine, and other ſpirituous Liquors, for in ſuch it will weaken the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and chill the Blood, and ſo cauſe a Dropſie. In this caſe, therefore, it is neceſſary to bleed twice or thrice, and after the ſecond, or at moſt after the third Bleeding, to purge very often till all the Symptoms quite ceaſe with Lenitives, as with Tamarinds, Sena, Rhubarb, Manna and ſyrup of Roſes ſolutive; and you muſt give, every night after Purging, one ounce of Diacodium, ſomewhat earlier than is uſual.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt take notice of a Symptom like a Rheumatiſm, which alſo ſometimes reſembles a nephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick pain, but it proceeds from an Ague, and muſt be cur'd as that is.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo another ſort of Rheumatiſm which comes near the Scurvy, and requires in a manner the ſame Cure; and, therefore, I call it a ſcorbutick Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm; the pain ſeizes ſometimes this, ſometimes that part, but ſeldom ſwells; nor is it accompanied with a Fever, nor is it ſo fixt, but is of a more wandering and uncertain diſpoſition, and accompanied with irregular Symptoms: Sometimes it ſeizes this or that Member, and then preſently it affects only the inner Parts, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions Sickneſs, which goes off again, when the pain of the external Parts returns, and ſo afflicts the Patient by turns, and continues a long while like thoſe Diſeaſes that are accounted moſt Chronical, it chiefly ſeizes Women, and Men of a weakly nature.</p>
                  <p>They who for a long while have us'd the Peruvian-bark are ſubject to this Diſeaſe, which, by the by, is the only inconvenience I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>CHAP. CXVII. Of the Peſtilential Fever, and of the Plague of the years <hi>1665</hi> and <hi>1666.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE Plague rarely rages violently in <hi>England</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener than once in the ſpace of 30 or 40 years: The laſt dreadful Plague deſtroyed 8000 in the ſpace of a Week, notwithſtanding that two thirds, at leaſt, of the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> fled into the Country for fear of the Infection.</p>
                  <p>Its firſt approach was always accompanied with ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhivering like the Fits of an Ague, preſently violent Vomitings, a pain about the region of the Heart as if it were preſſed, a burning Fever, with the uſual concourſe of Symptoms perpetually moleſt the Sick, till either Death it ſelf, or a happy eruption of a Bubo or Parotis, diſcharges the morbifick Matter, and ſo frees them from that deplorable condition. It does, indeed, now and then happen, but it is ſeldom that it comes without any ſenſe of a Fever before, and ſuddenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys Men, the Purple-ſpots, which are the Fore-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of preſent Death, breaking out, as they are about their Buſineſs. It ſometimes alſo happens, That Tumors appear, when neither a Fever, nor any other grievous Symptom went before.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, if a Tumour has not broke out, I bleed moderately with reſpect to the ſtrength and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the Sick, and afterwards a Sweat is eaſily and ſoon raiſed (whereas otherwiſe it is not only very difficulty procured, but there is alſo danger, leſt the Inflammation ſhould be heightned by it, and ſo the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens forced out) and the benefit of the Sweat immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately following abundantly, compenſates the loſs of Blood, which how little ſoever it be, would otherwiſe be very injurious. After Bleeding, which muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:65404:222"/>
in Bed (when all things are in a readineſs to promote Sweat) without any manner of delay; I order the Patient to be covered quite over with Cloaths, and that a piece of Flannel be bound to the forepart of his Head; and, indeed this covering of the Head conduces more to the procuring Sweat than any one would eaſily imagine; afterwards, if the Patient does not vomit, I give theſe and the like Sudorificks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Venice Treacle, two drachms, of the Electuary of the Egg, one ſcruple, of compound Powder of Crabs Eyes, twelve grains, of Cochinel, eight grains, of Saffron, four grains, with a ſufficient quantity of the juice of Kermes; make a Bolus, which let him take every ſixth hour, drinking after it ſix ſpoonfuls of the following Julep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Carduus water, compound Scordium water, each three ounces; of Treacle water two ounces; mingle them, make a Julep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Patient be troubled with Vomiting, as he is very frequently in the Plague and other peſtilential Fevers, I defer the giving of Sudorificks ſo long as till he begins to Sweat by means of the covering only, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that ſometimes I put part of the Sheet over the Face to collect the Vapors, for (which is indeed very well worth Obſervation) when the Rays of the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Matter extend themſelves to the circumference of the Body, the Looſneſs and Vomiting that were occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by their being inwardly reflected and caſt upon the Stomach and Bowels, ceaſe preſently of their own accord; ſo that how great ſoever the preceding ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Stomach was, the Medicines that are taken afterwards are eaſily retained, and procure Sweat as well as can be wiſhed.</p>
                  <p>I order, That the Sweat ſhould be continued for the ſpace of a natural day, by Sage-poſſet-drink or Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale, now and then taken; and I ſtrictly forbid, That the Patient ſhould be any way cleanſed; neither indeed do I permit, that the Shirt, how moiſt and foul ſoever it be, ſhould be changed within the ſpace of 24 hours
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:65404:223"/>
from the end of the Sweat, which I would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with the greateſt caution. But if the Sweat be circumſcribed in a narrower compaſs of time, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Symptoms ſoon returns, and the health of the Patient is very uncertain, which a longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Sweat would have put out of danger. If any defection be perceived towards the latter end, I permit the Sick to take a little Chicken-broath, the yolk of an Egg or the like, which with Cordials and Draughts commonly uſed to keep up the Sweat, abundantly repair the Strength.</p>
                  <p>I admoniſh, that Cold be carefully avoided, that their Cloaths dry on their Body of their own acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>d, and that all Drinks are taken ſomewhat hot, and that the uſe of Sage-poſſet-drink be continued for the ſpace of 24 hours after the Sweat. The next morning I give a common Purge, <hi>viz.</hi> of the infuſion of Tamarinds, of the leaves of Sena, of Rhubarb, Manna and ſyrup of Roſes ſolutive; and with this method, the next year after the Plague, I recovered very many that were ſeized with the Peſtilential Fever, ſo that not one died of this Diſeaſe that was under my care, after I began the uſe of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But where the Tumor has been out already, I have not hitherto ventured to bleed, though in a Body unapt to ſweat, fearing leaſt the ſudden death of the Patient ſhould prevent the deſigned ſweat, by reaſon of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick Matter flowing back to the empty Veins; yet perhaps Bleeding may be very ſafely adminiſtred, if a ſweat be procured preſently after it, without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of delay, which being prolonged to the ſpace above required, may be able to diſſipate and conſume by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little the whole bulk of the Humor, and with much leſs danger than when a legitimate maturation of the Impoſthume (which is very uncertain and fallible in ſo very acute a Diſeaſe) is long waited for.</p>

                  <head>CHAP CXVIII. Of the regular Small-Pox.</head>
                  <p>THere are two ſorts of them; either they are Diſtinct or Confluent.</p>
                  <p>The Diſtinct begin with a ſhivering and coldneſs, which is preſently follow'd with exceſſive heat, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pain in the Head and Back, Vomiting, a great propenſity to Sweat; I mean in grown Perſons, for I never yet obſerved any ſuch diſpoſition in Children, either before or after they came out; a pain at the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Breaſt, beneath the region of the Heart, if it be preſſed with the Hand, dulneſs and ſleepineſs, eſpecially in Children, and ſometimes Convulſive Fits; and if theſe happen to them that have all their Teeth, I reckon the Small-Pox are at hand, which moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly coming out a few Hours after, ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Prognoſtication: For inſtance, if the Child has a Convulſive Fit in the Evening, as it uſually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, the Small-Pox appear the next Morning; and moreover I have very often obſerv'd, that when they come immediately after theſe Fits, they riſe in large Puſtles, and are mild and favourable, and ſeldom flux: And theſe for the moſt part were the Symptoms which accompanied this Diſeaſe at its beginning, and preceded the eruption of the Puſtles. But here it is proper to acquaint you, that ſometimes it happened ſo, that in a looſer texture of the Blood, which is eaſily changed, the courſe of ſeparation was paſſed over gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually without any violent ſickneſs, before the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Matter diſcover'd it ſelf, by the eruption of the Puſtles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="468" facs="tcp:65404:224"/>The Diſtinct Small-Pox uſually come out on the fourth day incluſively, and ſometimes a little later, but rarely before, at which time, for the moſt part, the ſymptoms are very much abated, or totally vaniſh, and the Patient thinks himſelf very well; only grown Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſo diſpoſed to Sweat, that they can ſcarce be kept from it, though they have little or no Cloaths on them, which diſpoſition does not leave them till the Puſtles begin to ripen, and then it vaniſhes of its own accord: The eruption is after this manner, firſt Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as big as ſmall Pins heads here and there ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and firſt of all in the Face, Neck and Breaſt, and afterwards in the whole Body. At this time the Jaws are affected with a pain that increaſes as the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles riſe, which growing daily bigger and higher, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the neighbouring skin and Fleſh; for about the eighth day from the firſt approach of the Sickneſs, which I always diligently obſerve in this Diſeaſe, the ſpaces between, that before were ſomewhat white, now begin to be red and ſwell more or leſs, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Puſtles, with a tenſive and launcing pain of theſe Parts, which increaſing, hourly occaſions the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and Swelling; ſo that in progreſs of this Diſeaſe the Eye-lids are ſo filled up and extended, that the Patient is ſometimes depriv'd of Sight, and when they are thus Tumified, they ſhine and are like a Bladder blowed up; and if a greater number of Puſtles beſiege the Eyes at the firſt eruption, they ſooner retire to their dark Manſions; next after the Face, the Hands and Fingers, ſwell more or leſs, according to the number of the Puſtles: The Puſtles that were ſmooth and red to this day, are now grown rough and ſomewhat white, which is indeed the firſt ſign of their coming to maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; moreover, they caſt out by degrees a certain yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowiſh Matter, in colour like a Hony-comb, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Face and hands, when it is at height, cauſes a very florid Colour, not unlike a Damask-Roſe, in the ſpaces between the Small-Pox.

                     <pb n="469" facs="tcp:65404:224"/>That ſort of Small-pox which we call the Flux, has the ſame Symptoms with the Diſtinct, only they are more violent; the Sickneſs, the Vomiting, the Fever, and the Reſtleſneſs, rage more violently: Moreover, a Looſneſs ſometimes precedes the Eruption, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues a day or two after it. This ſort comes out gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally on the third day, ſometimes before, ſcarce ever after it. But it is to be Noted, when ſome grievous Symptom afflicts the Patient before the eruption, as a moſt violent pain, ſometimes in the region of the Loins, like a fit of the Stone; ſometimes in the Side, like a Pleuriſie, ſometimes in the Limbs, like a Rheumatiſm; laſtly in the Stomach, with violent Sickneſs and Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; In theſe caſes I have obſerved the Small-pox to come out later than ordinary. And in the nex place, I muſt acquaint you, that the Fever and other ſymptoms moleſt the ſick many days after the coming out of the Puſtles. This ſort comes out ſometimes like an Eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas, ſometimes like the Meaſles, and as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance they cannot be diſtinguiſhed by any but thoſe that are very converſant in this Diſtemper; yet he that ſhall diligently conſider the great difference as to the time of eruption in theſe Diſeaſes, and other Circumſtances which he may gather from the Hiſtory of each of them, will eaſily be able to diſtinguiſh them. Theſe do not riſe ſo high as the Diſtinct, eſpecially thoſe in the Face; after the eighth day they begin to change into a duskiſh Colour.</p>
                  <p>There are two other Symptoms that attend the Flux-pox, which are as conſiderable as the Puſtles or Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>viz.</hi> Salivation in grown People, and a Looſneſs in Children. The firſt of theſe is ſo perpetual a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant, that I never knew but one that had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent kind and was free from Salivation; but the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>viz.</hi> a Looſneſs, does not ſo certainly vex Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that have this ſort. Sometimes Salivation diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it ſelf at the firſt coming out, ſometimes not till a day or two after; firſt the matter is thin and eaſily ſpit up, ſo that the ſick foul a great many Cloaths in a nights time; but about the Eleventh day it is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:65404:225"/>
more clammy, ſo that it is difficulty hawked up, the Sick is thirſty, and now and then coughs as he drinks.</p>
                  <p>A Looſneſs does not invade Children ſo ſoon, as ſpitting does old People; but at what time ſoever it comes, if it be not ſtopped by Art, it continues through the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>In both kinds of ſmall Pox, the Fever is higheſt from the beginning to the eruption; after which it is more moderate, till the Puſtles begin to ripen, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it totally evaniſhes.</p>
                  <p>I have always obſerved, that when the diſeaſe was violent, the ſick had, as it were, a Fit in the evening; and then the Symptoms raged more cruelty.</p>
                  <p>In the next place I will treat of the irregular Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that happen in this diſeaſe, when it is unskilfully handled.</p>
                  <p>It is to be noted, therefore, that the irregular Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that occur on the eight Day, in the diſtinct ſmall Pox, and thoſe that happen on the eleventh in the Flux, always reckoning from the firſt approach of the Diſeaſe, are of very great moment with reſpect either to the Life or Death of the patient; and, therefore, they ought to be exactly weighed; for it is manifeſt that the greateſt part of thoſe that die of either ſort, die on the days above-mentioned.</p>
                  <p>When Sweat is promoted much by Cordials and hot Regimen, the Particles are eliminated, which ſhould have ſerved to elevate the Puſtles, and to ſwell the Face on the Eight Day; and it appears flaccid and white, and the Sweat, which flowed freely to this day, now ceaſes of its own accord, nor it can it be raiſed again with the hotteſt Cordials: The patient is taken light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed of a ſudden, with Anxiety, violent Sickneſs and reſtleſſneſs, he makes Water often, but little at a time, and in the ſpace of a very few hours, takes leave of his Friends, and repairs to his long home.</p>
                  <p>But in the Flux the Sick is in the greateſt danger, and moſt commonly dies on the 11th Day; for the Salivation which hitherto preſerved the Patient is wont to ceaſe of its own accord at this time: Therefore, unleſs the ſwelling of the Face perſiſts a little longer,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:65404:225"/>
and that of the Hands now manifeſtly beginning ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it's place, the ſick muſt neceſſarily periſh: But it happens too often in this hot Diſeaſe, that the Craſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of the blood being weakened, and broke by an over-hot Regimen, and being ſo highly inflamed, that it is no longer able to exterminate leaſurely the inflammatory Particles, (to ſay nothing at preſent of thoſe Miſchiefs that are occaſioned by ſweat unſeaſonably forced) ſo that either the Face or Hands do not ſwell at all, or the Tumour vaniſhes with the Salivation.</p>
                  <p>There are yet other ſymptoms that happen at any time of the Diſeaſe, and belong as well to the diſtinct ſmall Pox as the Flux. As a Frenſie, a Coma and Purple Spots, which are moſt commonly the forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Death; and ſometimes there is a bloody Urin, or Blood is caſt up from the Lungs, both theſe Hemorrhages happen moſt commonly at the beginning of the Diſeaſe, before the Puſtles come out; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo there is a total ſuppreſſion of Urine. There are alſo other ſymptoms that ſometimes ariſe from a cauſe contrary to thoſe above mention'd, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has been injured by violent Cold or exceſſive Bleeding, or by being over purg'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the Puſtles fall of a ſudden, and a Looſneſs ſupervenes, ſo that the Patient, if he be Adult, is in great danger; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Tumour of the Face and Hands is repell'd on this account.</p>
                  <p>But the Symptoms that proceed from taking Cold very rarely occur, for what thoſe do that are occaſioned by too hot a Regimen.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Signs of this Diſeaſe ſhew themſelves, I keep the ſick from the open Air, and forbid them the uſe of Wine and Fleſh, and allow them ſmall Beer gently warmed with a Toſt for their ordinary Drink, and now and then permit them to drink as much of it as they will, I order them for their Victuals, Oatmeal and Barly Broaths, and roſted Apples, and other things, which are neither too hot nor cold, nor too hard to be digeſted; I forthwith prohibit a hot Regimen and the uſe of all manner of Cordials. On the fourth day I commit the ſick to his Bed; and then if they come not out well, ſome gentle Cordial may be properly preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:65404:226"/>
at leaſt for once, to drive out the Puſtles. Among the Medicines for this purpoſe, thoſe they call Paregoricks, ſuch as liquid Laudanum, Diaſcordium, and the like, if they be mixed in a ſmall quantity with ſome proper cordial Waters excell the reſt: But it is to be noted, That if I am call'd to a ſtrong young Man, who has beſides given occaſion to the Diſeaſe by exceſſive drinking of Wine, or any Spirituous Liquor whatſoever, I reckon it not ſufficient for the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ebullition of the Blood, that he abſtrain from his Bed and Cordials; unleſs, moreover, he be blooded in the Arm.</p>
                  <p>When the Puſtles firſt come out, I then diligently conſider whether they be of the diſtinct or confluent kind, becauſe they differ exceedingly one from the other, though they agree as to ſome ſymptoms. If, therefore, from the bigneſs and paucity of the Puſtles, and the ſlowneſs of their coming out, and from the vaniſhing of ſickneſs and other ſymptoms, which tire the Patient after the eruption of the flux Pox, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they are the diſtinct ſort, I take care that the ſick be refreſhed with ſmall Beer, Oatmeal and Barly-gruel, and the like. And if the ſmall Pox be but few, and in Summer-time, and that very hot, I ſee no reaſon why the Patient ſhould be kept ſtifled up in Bed, and why he may not rather riſe a few hours every day, provided the inconveniencies of too much Cold or Heat may be prevented by the place and cloathing; but if either the cold ſeaſon of the Year, or a large eruption of the Puſtles, put the Patient under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of keeping his Bed continually, I take care that he lie not hotter nor has more Cloaths on him than when he was in health, and that he have a Fire kindled only morning and evening, unleſs it be Winter; nor do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> require that he ſhould be always fixed to one place, leſt he ſweat, which I confidently affirm cannot be promoted without great danger.</p>
                  <p>When the Diſeaſe is going off, it is proper to give three or four ſpoonfulls of Canary-Wine hot, or ſome other temperate Cordial Medicine. At the ſame time alſo, a little hotter and more Cordial-diet may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. For inſtance, Sugar-ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, and Oatmeal-candie
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:65404:226"/>
and the like; nor is there need of any other thing at all in the diſtinct and gentle ſort, if the Patient will ſuffer himſelf to be treated moderately in this method and diet, unleſs by change Reſtleſſneſs, or Watchings, ſhould now and then perſuade the uſe of a Parego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick.</p>
                  <p>But if the ſmall Pox Flux, the caſe is very hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous; for I reckon this ſort is no leſs different from the other than the Plague is from this; though among the Vulgar, who take names and words for things, the cure of both is ſaid to be the ſame; for towards the end of the diſeaſe the ſick is in great danger, <hi>viz.</hi> on the 11th Day in the common Flux-pox, on the 14th Day in a worſer ſort, and the 17th Day in the worſt ſort: But ſometimes, though rarely, one the 21ſt Day, the Fever, the Reſtleſſneſs and other ſymptoms invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, whereby the ſick is generally deſtroyed, unleſs Art relieve him: Wherefore, ſeeing there is ſo much danger when they Flux, the Phyſician ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour all he can to hinder their Fluxing, by bleeding preſently in the Arm, if there be the leaſt ſuſpicion of the Flux-pox, and by giving a Vomit afterwards, and by keeping the ſick up till the 6th Day from the firſt ſickneſs. Afterwards he muſt be put to Bed, and keep there to the end of the diſeaſe; but he muſt have no more Cloaths on, nor a greater fire in his Chamber than he uſed to have when he was well, and he muſt drink freely of ſmall Beer or other cooling Liquors. But becauſe, notwithſtanding the ſick frequently grows hot, lightheaded, and reſtleſs, I give an Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne every Night, but a little earlier than is uſual; becauſe in this Diſeaſe, a fit of heat and reſtleſſneſs comes almoſt every day towards the evening.</p>
                  <p>But, which is to be lamented, notwithſtanding theſe things, and all other Phyſical Helps, the ſick is very often ſeized on the 11th Day, or on ſome other of thoſe Days, which we ſaid, were moſt fatal in the various kinds of Flux-pox, with a violent Fever, difficulty of breathing, and reſtleſſneſs, and dies ſuddenly. In this caſe nothing is more effectual than the taking away of ten or twelve ounces of Blood, and in the evening a large Anodine muſt be given, as before; and ſo
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:65404:227"/>
afterwards morning and evening, and ſometimes oftener; for it is diligently to be noted, that in ſome the fury of the Diſeaſe is ſo high, that a very large doſed Anodyne cannot ſtop its force in 12 hours; in which caſe it is neceſſary to repeat the Anodyne every 6th or every 8th hour.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe it happens often at the latter end of the Diſeaſe, that the Body is bound up ſo much, that the ſick is like to be ſuffocated, and conſequenrly is in great danger; in this I have given ſucceſsfully an ounce and an half of Lenitive Electuary diſſolved in four ounces of Succory-water or the like; which Draught gives ſome ſtools before night; but if it does not, an Anodyne muſt be given in the evening, and ſooner, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Purge, if great Reſtleſſneſs or ſome conſiderable ſickneſs threaten danger.</p>
                  <p>If, therefore, the Purge does not anſwer the firſt day, it muſt be repeated the next, and then it ſeldom fails, and in this manner Bleeding and Purging may be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Intervals, as occaſion requires. But it is to be noted, that the ſick muſt not be purged till the 13th day or after, nor then, unleſs Bleeding has gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For ſpitting of Blood and a bloody Urine coming upon the ſmall Pox, for both theſe Hemorraghes come ſometimes at the beginning of the Diſeaſe: After bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing largely once, give an Anodyne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of red Poppy water, two ounces, of liquid Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum, 14 drops, of diſtill'd Vinegar, three drachms, of Diacodium, half an ounce; make a Draught to be repeated every night at bed time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Troches of Lemnian Earth and of Bole-armen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick, each one drachm, of ſealed Earth, Bloodſtone, Dragon's-blood and red Coral prepared, each half a drachm, of Maſtich and Gum-arabick, each one ſcruple; mingle them, make a fine Powder, whereof let him take half a drachm every third hour in a ſpoonful of ſyrup of Comfry, drinking upon it four or five ſpoonfuls of the following Julep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="475" facs="tcp:65404:227"/>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Plantain and Oak-buds, each three ounces, of Cinnamon-water Hordeate, two ounces, of ſyrup of dried Roſes, one ounce; make it a little acid with ſpirit of Vitriol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Emulſions alſo of the four greater cold Seeds with white Popies do a great deal of good. But after the Hemorrhage is ſtopt, you muſt proceed according to the method deſcribed in the ſmall Pox.</p>
                  <p>Great care muſt be taken that the Salivation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue according to the manner of it, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the 12th or 13th day; for if it quite ſtop before the 11th day, the Sick is in great danger: It may be much promoted by ordering the Sick to drink freely ſmall Beer, or any other Liquor, which is neither heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor provokes ſweat.</p>
                  <p>In the next place the Looſneſs in Children muſt be permitted, becauſe it evacuates the morbifick matter. At laſt, when the Puſtles are cruſty and hard, I uſe to anoint the Face often with Oyl of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.</p>
                  <p>If in the diſtinct ſmall Pox the Face does not ſwell, I give an Anodyne preſently; but if the Patient be light-headed and very ſick, and makes Water often, but little at a time, he can be relieved no other way, Death being near at hand, than by giving Narcoticks freely, or by taking away a large quantity of Blood, and by expoſing the Body to the Air; but I would not be ſo underſtood here as if in every Phrenſy coming upon the ſmall Pox, there being no Symptom more frequent, that I ſhould adviſe Bleeding preſently; but only in that which therefore happens, becauſe the Face does not ſwell in the diſtinct kind, tho' there be a great number of Puſtles.</p>
                  <p>If in the Flux-Pox the Spitle be ſo thick and clammy that the Sick is in danger of being ſuffocated, which happens often on the 11th day, a Gargariſm muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarly be preſcibed, and muſt be ordered to be uſed often Day and Night: It may be made of ſmall Beer or Barly-water, with Hony of Roſes. Or, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="476" facs="tcp:65404:228"/>
                     <hi>Take of the bark of Elm, ſix drachms, of Liquorice, half a drachm, of Raiſins of the Sun ſton'd number twenty, of red Roſes, two pugils; boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Water to a pint and an half: In the ſtrained Liquor diſſolve of ſimple Oxymel, and of Hony of Roſes, each two ounces; mingle them, make a Gargariſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when the ſick is in danger to be ſuffocated every moment, and is ſtupid, an ounce and an half of the Infuſion of Crocus Metallorum muſt be given, for a leſs Doſe will not work, by reaſon of the ſtupidity of the ſick. But this Remedy does not always do the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                  <p>The Coma may be eaſily relieved by the help of a moderate Regimen.</p>
                  <p>For a Suppreſſion of Urine, which ſometimes afflicts young and brisk People, nothing does ſo well as taking the Sick out of Bed; and after he has walked twice or thrice croſs the Room, by the aſſiſtance of the By-ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he will preſently make Water freely, and be much relieved thereby.</p>
                  <p>But the Symptoms ariſing from catching cold, or by Evacuations unduly uſed, whereby the ſmall Pox are ſtruck in, muſt be removed by Cordials, and an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Regimen; but they muſt not be continued after the Symptoms are gone off: The chief of theſe are a flatting of the Puſtles, and a Looſneſs in the diſtinct ſmall Pox; for in the Flux a depreſſion of the Puſtles is natural; nor is a Looſneſs dangerous in Children. In both theſe caſes, a Cordial-potion made of diſtilled Waters, Diaſcordium, liquid Laudanum, and the like, is proper, not only to remove theſe Symptoms, but alſo at any time of the Diſeaſe, if the Sick com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of a pain at the Heart, or of ſickneſs. But to ſpeak the truth, Symptoms of this kind are very rare, compared with thoſe which owe their original to the other extream, which is more fatal, though leſs bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
                  <p>When the Patient is mending, and the Puſtles are falling off, after he has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:65404:228"/>
the 21ſt or 22d day, I think he ought to be blooded, if the Diſeaſe has been violent; and, after Bleeding, he muſt be purged three or four times.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes after the Sick has recovered of the Flux-Pox, and riſes daily, he has great ſwellings in his Legs; but they either go off of themſelves, or are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily cured after Bleeding and Purging, by the uſe of emollient and diſcutient Herbs boiled in Milk, as Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the leaves of Mullein, Elder, Bays, with the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Camomil and Melilot.</p>
                  <p>The diſtinct irregular ſmall Pox of the years 1670, 1671 and 1672, differed from the general diſtinct ſmall Pox in the following things: Firſt, the Eruption was generally on the third day, and then in the proceſs of the Diſeaſe the Puſtles did not arrive to a due bigneſs; and towards the end, when they began to ripen, they ſeemed black.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, there was a ſalivation ſometimes, though rarely, when there were very few Puſtles: But the flux-Pox differed in many things from the other Flux-Pox; for they came out ſometimes on the ſecond, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the third day, in the form of a rediſh Tumour covering the whole Face, and thicker than an Eryſipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, and ſcarce any viſible diſtance betwixt the Puſtles, with a heap of almoſt infinite, red, angry Pimples run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into one, and diſguiſing the whole Body between the Puſtles; eſpecially in the Thighs appeared ſome little Bladders very conſpicuous like a burn, and diſtended with clear Water, which flowed out plentifully, when the skin was broken, the Fleſh underneath being black like a Mortification. But this dreadful ſymptom ſeldom happened.</p>
                  <p>The Fever, and all other ſymptoms which either preceded or accompanied this kind of ſmall Pox were more violent than in other ſorts of Pox, and had a greater Inflammation. The free uſe of the white Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Milk-water did a great deal of good in this ſort.</p>
                  <p>The Flux of the Courſes, which happens often to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men when they have this Diſeaſe, requires a free uſe of theſe Liquors, if they flow at an unuſual time.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CXIX. Of the Meaſles.</head>
                  <p>THIS Diſeaſe chiefly invades Infants, and all thoſe that are together in the ſame Houſe. It begins with ſhaking and ſhivering, and with an inequality of heat and cold, which mutually expel one another the firſt day; the ſecond day it ends in a perfect Fever with violent ſickneſs, drowth and want of Appetite, the Tongue is white but not dry, there is a tickling Cough with a heavineſs of the Head and Eyes accompanied with a perpetual drowſineſs, and for the moſt part a Humour diſtils from the Eyes and Noſe, and this effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Tears is a certain ſign of the approaching Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles. To which this is to be added, no leſs certain, that tho' this Diſeaſe ſhews it ſelf moſt commonly in the Face after the manner of little ſwellings in the skin, yet in the Breaſt rather red ſpots than ſwellings are perceived, ariſing no higher than the ſuperficies of the skin; the Patient ſneezes as if he had taken cold, and the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids ſwell a little before the Eruption; he vomits, but is oftner troubled with a Looſneſs with greeniſh Stools: But this chiefly happens to Children that are breeding their Teeth, and they are frowarder in this Diſeaſe than they are wont to be for the moſt part; the ſymptoms increaſe till the fourth day, at which time generally, (though ſometimes they are deferred) little red ſpots like Fleabites begin to come out about the Forehead and other parts of the Face, and being increaſed in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and magnitude branch into one another, and ſo
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:65404:229"/>
paint the Face with large red ſpots of various Figures, which are occaſioned by little red Wheals, not far diſtant one from another, that are elevated a little above the ſuperficies of the skin, and their Protuberances may be perceived by a gentle touch, though they can ſcarce be ſeen. Theſe ſpots ſpread themſelves by degrees from the Face, which at firſt they only poſſeſs'd to the Breaſt, Belly, Thighs and Legs: But they affect the Trunk and Members with redneſs only, without any ſenſible inequality of the Skin. The ſymptoms of the Meaſles do not abate by the Eruption, as in the ſmall Pox, yet I never obſerved the Vomiting afterwards; but the Cough and Fever increaſe, with the difficulty of Breathing, weakneſs of the Eyes, and the defluxion on them, with perpetual drowzineſs and want of Appetite, continuing the ſame as before. On the 6th day, or thereabouts, the Skin breaking, and the Puſtles drying off, the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and Face grow rough, and at that time the ſpots in other parts of the Body are very large and very read. About the 8th day, the ſpots in the Face vaniſh, and are ſcarce perceived in the reſt of the Body: But on the 9th day they totally diſappear, and as we ſaid the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles moſt commonly vaniſh on the 8th day, at which time the Vulgar, being deceived by reckoning upon the time the ſmall Pox uſe to laſt, affirm, They are ſtruck in, tho' really they have finiſhed their courſe, and they think that theſe ſymptoms which come upon their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off are occaſioned by their being ſtruck in ſo ſoon: For it is to be noted, That the Fever and difficulty of Breathing are increaſed at that time, and the Cough is more vexatious, ſo that the Patient can neither ſleep night nor day. Children are chiefly ſubject to theſe ill ſymptoms, which appear now at the going off of the Meaſles by reaſon of too hot a Regimen or hot Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that were uſed to force them out; and by this means they are caſt into a Peripneumonia, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys more than the ſmall Pox or any ſymptom belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; and yet the Meaſles are not at all dangerous if they are skilfully managed. And among the reſt of the ill ſymptoms, a Looſneſs often happens, which either preſently ſucceeds the Diſeaſe, or continues many Weeks after it and all its ſymptoms are gone off, not without
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:65404:230"/>
great danger to the Patient by reaſon of a continual loſs of Spirits; and ſometimes after a very hot Regimen, the Meaſles are firſt livid and afterwards black; but this only happens to grown People, and they are utterly loſt when the blackneſs firſt appears, unleſs they are preſently relieved by bleeding and a more temperate Regimen.</p>
                  <p>As the Meaſles are much of the ſame nature with the ſmall Pox, ſo is the method of Cure much the ſame. Hot Medicines and a hot Regimen are very dangerous, how frequently ſoever they are uſed by ignorant Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to drive the Diſeaſe from the Heart. This method, above others, has been moſt ſucceſsful in my practice, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Patient be kept in his Bed only two or three days after the Eruption, that the blood may gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly breath out, according to its own genius, through the Pores of the Skin, the inflamed Particles, which offend it; and that he have no more Cloaths nor Fire than he is wont to have when he is well: I forbid all Fleſh, and allow him Oatmeal and Barly-broaths, and the like, and ſometimes a roſted Apple; his Drink muſt be either ſmall Beer, or Milk boil'd with treble the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water. I oftentimes mitigated the Cough, which almoſt continually accompanies this Diſeaſe, with a draught of ſome pectoral Decoction, or with a Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus fitted for the purpoſe; but above all the reſt, I took care to give Diacodium every night through the whole courſe of this Diſeaſe. For Example,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the pectoral Decoction, one pint and an half, of ſyrup of Violets and Maiden-hair, each one ounce and an half; mingle them and make an Apozem, take three or four ounces three or four times a day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oil of ſweet Almonds, two ounces, of ſyrup of Violets and Maiden-hair, each one ounce, of white Sugercandy, a ſufficient quantity; mingle them and make a Linctus, of which let the Sick lick often, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when his Cough troubles him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of black Cherry-water, three ounces, of Diacodium, one ounce; mingle them for a draught to be taken
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:65404:230"/>
every night. But if the Patient be an Infant, the doſe of the Pectorals and of the Narcotick is to be leſſened with reſpect to the Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if by means of too hot Cordials and too hot a Regimen, the Patient be in danger of his Life after the Meaſles go off, which is very frequent by the violence of the Fever and the difficulty of breathing, and other Accidents that uſe to afflict thoſe that have a Peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia, I have bled the ſmalleſt Infants in the Arm, and have taken away that quantity of Blood which their Age and Strength indicated, with very great ſucceſs; and ſometimes when the Diſeaſe has been obſtinate, I have repeated bleeding: The Looſneſs alſo which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Meaſles, is alſo cur'd by bleeding.</p>
                  <p>What we have now ſaid of the Cure of thoſe ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms that come upon the going off of the Meaſles, may be ſometimes alſo of uſe when they are at their height, if they are occaſioned by a falſe and artificial heat.</p>
                  <p>I was called to viſit a Maid-ſervant that had this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, together with a Fever, difficulty of Breathing, and purple ſpots all over her Body, with very many other dangerous ſymptoms; all which I attributed to the hot Regimen and hot Medicines, which were too much uſed. I ordered her to be bled in the Arm, and I preſcribed a cooling pectoral Ptiſan to be taken often; by the help of which, and a temperate Regimen, the purple Spots, and all the other ſymptoms vaniſhed by degrees.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CXX. Of a continual Fever.</head>
                  <p>FIRST, I obſerve, That the inordinate commotion of the Blood, the Cauſe or Companion of this Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, is ſtirred up by Nature, either that ſome heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Matter contained in it, and inimical to it, ſhould be excluded, or that the Blood ſhould be changed into ſome new diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>I reckon that the true and natural Indications that ariſe in this Diſeaſe ſhew, That the commotion of the Blood muſt be kept to that degree, which is agreeable to Nature's purpoſe, that it does not riſe too high on the one hand, from whence great ſymptoms flow, nor be depreſſed too low on the other, by which means the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion of the morbiſick Matter may be hindred, or the endeavours of the Blood affecting a new Condition fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated; ſo that whither the Fever takes its riſe from heterogeneous Matter provoking it, or from the Blood affecting a new State, in either caſe the Indication is the ſame. Theſe things being premiſed, I inſtitute the method of Cure in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>When I am called to Patients, whoſe Blood of it ſelf is weak, as it is moſt times in Children, or when it wants Spirits, as in old Age, and in young Men weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by long Diſeaſes, I forbear bleeding; for if I ſhould bleed ſuch, their Blood being already too weak, it would be rendred altogether unfit to perform the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Deſpumation.</p>
                  <p>But when I have to do with thoſe whoſe Blood is of a contrary Nature, ſuch as is wont to be in young Men of a robuſt Conſtitution, and ſanguine Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I order Bleeding in the firſt place, which cannot be omitted here without hazard; beſide, in ſome other caſes to be mentioned hereafter; for otherwiſe not only Phrenſies, Pleuriſies and ſuch-like Inflammations may be
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:65404:231"/>
feared, but alſo by reaſon of the ſuperfluity, a Stagna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole Maſs.</p>
                  <p>As to the quantity, I only take away ſo much Blood as I conceive will free the Sick from ſuch dangers he is obnoxious to by the immoderate commotion of the ſame; furthermore, I regulate the Eſtuation by repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bleeding, or omitting it, by uſing or forbidding the uſe of hot Cordials, and laſtly by keeping the Body looſe, or ſtopping it, as I perceive the commotion is high or low.</p>
                  <p>After Bleeding, if it be neceſſary, according to the caſes above-mentioned, I diligently enquire whether the Patient was enclined to Nauſeouſneſs at the beginning of the Fever, and if ſo, I preſently preſcribe a Vomit, unleſs the tender Age, or ſome great Weakneſs of the ſick forbid it: Truly a Vomit is ſo neceſſary when an inclination to Vomiting has preceded, that unleſs that Humour be expelled, it will occaſion many difficult Symptoms, that will hinder the Phyſician in performing the Cure, and will very much endanger the Patient; a Looſneſs is the chief and moſt uſual of theſe, which moſt commonly follows in the declination of the Fever, as often as Vomits are Indicated. The Vomit I frequently uſe is this following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the infuſion of Crocus Mettalorum ſix Drachms, of Oxymel of Squills, and compound Syrup of Scabious, each half an ounce, mingle them, make a Vomit, which I order to be taken in the Afternoon, two hours after a light Dinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that the Vomit may ſucceed the better, I appoint ſix or eight pints of Poſſet-drink to be provided, for theſe Medicines are dangerous, if they are not waſhed off; and therefore as often as the Patient Vomits or goes to Stool, he muſt preſently take a draught of it, by which means the Gripes will be prevented, and he will vomit eaſier.</p>
                  <p>It is to be Noted, that if the condition of the Patient requires Bleeding and Vomiting, it is ſafeſt to bleed firſt, for otherwiſe, whilſt the Veſſels are diſtened with Blood, there is great danger, leſt by violent ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:65404:232"/>
to Vomit, the Veſſels of the Lungs ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and the Brain hurt, and ſo the Patient may die Apoplectick, of which I could produce ſome Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, if I thought it convenient; let it ſuffice that I warn you to uſe great caution in this caſe.</p>
                  <p>If any one ſhould ask, at what time of the Fever I would give a Vomit, I ſay at the very beginning, if I had my choice; for by this means, the Sick may be defended from thoſe horrid ſymptoms that take their riſe from the filth of thoſe Humours that lurk in the Stomach and Neighbouring Parts, and perhaps we may cruſh the Diſeaſe in its beginning.</p>
                  <p>But if we are called in late, as we are often, ſo that we cannot aſſiſt the Patient at the beginning of the Fever by preſcribing a Vomit, yet I have thought it proper to order one at any time of the Diſeaſe, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Patient has ſtrength enough to bear the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: I have given a Vomit on the twelfth day, and I ſhould not doubt to preſcribe one later, unleſs the weakneſs of the Patient forbids.</p>
                  <p>The Evening after taking the Vomit, I always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to quiet the tumult raiſed in the Humours by the Vomit, and therefore I preſcribe an Anodyne to be taken at Bed-time, for Inſtance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Erratick Poppy two Ounces, of Aqua-Mirabilis two drachms, of Syrup of white and red Poppies, each half an ounce, mingle them, make a Draught.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if there be no fear of raiſing the ebullition for the future, either by reaſon of a great loſs of Blood, or by frequent Vomiting and Stools, or by a preſent apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rexy, or debility of the Fever, or its declining State, I boldly order a large Doſe of Diaſcordium, either by it ſelf, or mixed with ſome Cordial-water, inſtead of the Anodyne above-deſcribed, and it is indeed an excellent Medicine, if it be given in a due quantity.</p>
                  <p>And now before I leave off diſcourſing of Vomits, I muſt acquaint you, that it is by no means ſafe, at leaſt in this Fever, to give Vomits of the infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> to Children, or to any under Fourteen, no, not in the leaſt quantity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="485" facs="tcp:65404:232"/>The Fatigue of Vomiting being over, I further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with my ſelf, whether notwithſtanding the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Evacuations, the Blood continues yet to rage ſo much, that it is ſtill neceſſary to reſtrain its efferveſcence, or whether it be ſo very languid that it wants to be heightened, or laſtly whether the Fermentation being reduced to a due degree, may be left to it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger to the Patient.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore if the Blood ferments ſo violently, that we may reaſonably ſuſpect that the Patient is either ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to a Phrenſie, or any other troubleſome Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, proceeding from too great an ebullition of the Blood; the day after taking of the Vomit, I preſcribe a Gliſter. For Inſtance,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the common Decoction for a Gliſter one pint, of Syrup of Violets and Brown Sugar, each two ounces; mingle them, make a Gliſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I order it ſhould be repeated upon occaſion; by which it often happens that the Blood being ſomewhat ventilated and cooled, its efferveſcence is ſufficiently bridled: But ſometimes it is neceſſary to repeat Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once and again, <hi>viz.</hi> In thoſe of a very Sanguine Complexion, and in the flower of their Age, or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have imprinted on their Blood a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory diſpoſition, by the too frequent uſe of Wine: But for the moſt part there is no need of ſo great a remedy as is repeated Bleeding; and except in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes above-mention'd, the efferveſcence may be ſufficiently ſuppreſſed by the help of Gliſters; wherefore, if the Blood ferment too much, I order a Gliſter to be inject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every day, or every other day, as the caſe requires, and that it he done to the tenth day of the Diſeaſe, or thereabouts; but if much Blood has been taken away, or the Patient is Aged, I order no Gliſters at that time, though the Blood be very hot; for in theſe caſes as there is no fear that by the omiſſion of Gliſters, the ebullition begun ſhould proceed ſo far as that there ſhould be eminent danger from ſome violent Symptom; ſo it is moſt certain, that by the uſe of them, the Strength, and as I may ſay, the Tone of the Blood, is
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:65404:233"/>
ſo much relaxed, that eſpecially in old Men, (for Gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are not uſed with ſo good Succeſs in old Men as in young) Nature is obſtructed in her buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>But whether Bleeding has been uſed or omitted, if the efferveſcence be too languid, and wants to be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up; in this caſe we muſt wholly abſtain from the uſe of Gliſters, even before the tenth day, and much rather if it be paſt, for to what purpoſe ſhould we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſuppreſs the fermentation that is too weak already?</p>
                  <p>As to Cordials, I have found by experience, that the too early uſe of them has been very injurious, <hi>viz.</hi> (Bleeding having not been firſt uſed) there is danger leſt the crude Matter ſhould fall upon the Membranes of the Brain, or the like, or on the Pleura; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I always take care that Cordials be not given, when no Blood, or but very little has been taken away, and there has been no other conſiderable Evacuation, or when the Patient has not paſſed the flower of his Age. But if the Patient be weakned by profuſe Evacuations, I uſe to give Cordials even at the beginning of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but on the twelfth day of the Diſeaſe, things then tending to Secretion, I ſuppoſe we ought freely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the uſe of hotter Medicines, and indeed a little ſooner, if there be no danger of driving the febrile Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the principal Parts.</p>
                  <p>If the Fermentation proceed well, the Deſpumation will be finiſhed about the Fourteenth day. But if you uſe Coolers too late, and ſo by their means ſuppreſs the efferveſcence, it is not ſtrange if the Fever continue to the Twenty firſt day, and much longer in feeble Bodies ill managed.</p>
                  <p>The Cordials I preſcribe are ſuch as thoſe, which I will mention by and by; thoſe that are more moderate, I uſe at the beginning of the Diſeaſe, when the heat is very violent, always proceeding gradually to the uſe of hotter, according to the progreſs of the Diſeaſe, and the degrees of ebullition, always remembring that it is lawful if much Blood has been taken away, or if the Patient be Aged, to adminiſter ſtronger Cordials than when bleeding has not preceded, or when the Patint was in the flower of his Age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="487" facs="tcp:65404:233"/>Thoſe Cordials I call Moderate, are made of Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Waters. For inſtance, of Borrage, Citron, Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, Treacle, compound Scordium-water, mingled with the Syrup of Baum of Fernelius, of Gilliflowers, of juice of Citron and the like; but the Stronger of Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coin's Powder, Bezoar, Confection of Hyacinth, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice Treacle and the like. Theſe which follow are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of Borrage, Citron, compound Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, Black-cherries, each two ounces, Cinamon-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water hordeated one ounce, Pearls prepared two drachms, of Chriſtaline Sugar a ſufficient quantity; mingle them, take four ſpoonfuls often in a day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Waters of the whole Citron and of Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, each three ounces, of the cold Cordial-water of Saxony, one ounce, of Treacle-water, and of the Syrups of Baulm of Fernelius, of Gilliflowers, and of the juice of Citron, each half an ounce; mingle them, and make a Julep, of which take often.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Gaſcoin's Powder, of oriental and occidental Bezoar-ſtone, of each one ſcruple, one leaf of Gold; mix them and make a fine Powder. Take to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of twelve grains when there is occaſion, in the Syrup of the juice of Citron, and of Gilliflowers, each two drachms, drinking upon it a few ſpoonfuls of the Julep preſcribed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Treacle-water four ounces, of the Seeds of Citron two drachms; beat them together and make an Emul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; add to the ſtrained Liquor a ſufficient quantity of Pearl-ſugar, to make it grateful to the Taſte. Take two ſpoonfuls three times in a day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Fermentation be neither too high nor too low, I leave it in that ſtate, and uſe no Remedies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I am forced to do ſomething by the importunity of the Sick, or his Friends about him, that may pleaſe them without obſtructing my deſign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="488" facs="tcp:65404:234"/>And now I muſt tell you, that when I was called to a poor Body, who was not able to be at the charge of going through a long courſe of Phyſick, I did nothing elſe, after Bleeding and Purging was over, if they were indicated, but order them to keep their Beds all the time of their Sickneſs, and to drink Oatmeal and Barly-broath, and the like, and that they ſhould drink Small-beer warm, moderately, to quench their Thirſt. I took care that they ſhould have a Gliſter of Milk and Sugar every day, till the Tenth or Eleventh day, and towards the end of the Fever, ſeparation being now begun, if it were ſlow, I permitted them now and then ſtronger drink to help it inſtead of a Cordial. And ſo without any more ado, except that I uſed to give a gentle Purge at the end of the Diſeaſe, I cured them.</p>
                  <p>If the Patient be very weak, or if there be not a perfect Deſpumation, ſo that I cannot boldly give a Purge on the Fifteenth day, I defer it to the Seventeenth, at which time I give the following, or the like, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtrength of the Patient.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Tamarinds half an ounce, of Senna two drachms, of Rhubarb one drachm and an half; boyl them in a ſufficient quantity of Water; to three ounces of the ſtrained Liquor, add Syrup of Roſes ſolutive and Manna, each one ounce; mingle them and make a Potion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Purging being over, I order the Patient to riſe, who has been hitherto kept in Bed by my preſcription, and to return gradually to his accuſtomed Diet.</p>
                  <p>It happens often, eſpecially in old Men, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, though the Fever be cured and the Body ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently purged, is notwithſtanding very weak, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expectorats by Cough, and ſometimes alſo hauks up a great quantity of clammy Phlegm, which Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom does not only affrighten the Patient, but alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes upon the Phyſician, eſpecially if he be unwary, and induces him to believe, that this will make way for a Conſumption, though I have obſerved that this is not ſo very dangerous. In this caſe I order the Patient to drink Old Malago, or Muskadine with a Toaſt, which
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:65404:234"/>
takes off this Symptom in the ſpace of a few days, as I have often Experienced.</p>
                  <p>If the fermentation proceed well, there will be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect deſpumation of the morbifick Matter within the time aforeſaid; but if cooling Remedies or Gliſters have been given too late, the Fever will continue much longer, eſpecially in very ancient Men, ill manag'd by the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. I have been ſometimes called to ſuch after they have laboured under a Fever forty days or more, and have tryed all things to induce deſpumation of the Blood; but it was ſo much weakened, partly by old Age, and partly by Gliſters and cooling Medicines, that I could not attain my end, either by Cordials, or any other corroborating Medicines, but either their Fever ſtood its ground, or if otherwiſe it ſeemed to ceaſe, the Patient's ſtrength was very low, and in a manner gone.</p>
                  <p>But other Remedies being unſucceſsfully uſed, I have been often forced to take this courſe, and indeed with very good Succeſs, <hi>viz.</hi> I have applied the brisk heat of young People to the Sick; neither is there any reaſon why any one ſhould much wonder, that the Patient is ſo mightily ſtrengthned and weak Nature relieved by this method, though it be unuſual, as that it can deliver it ſelf from the relicks of the Matter to be eliminated; ſeeing it is eaſie to conceive a transfuſion of a great quantity of vigorous Eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>luvia from the ſound and ſtrong Body into the withered one of the Sick. Nor have I ever found, that the repeated application of hot Cloaths could at all do that which the now mention'd me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod has perform'd, where both the heat applied is more agreeable to the human Body, and gentle, moiſt, equal and laſting: And though this way of emitting balſamick Spirits into the Body of the Patient may ſeem abſurd, yet it has been uſed by others with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſucceſs. Nor truly am I aſhamed to mention this Remedy, though perhaps ſome impertinent Men, ſuperſtitiouſly contemning all things Vulgar, may ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule me for it; for I think the health and good of my Neighbour is very much to be preferred before their vain Opinions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="490" facs="tcp:65404:235"/>He that prudently and with due conſideration hath obſerved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he method hitherto deliver'd, will free the Patient, if not from all, yet at leaſt from moſt of theſe Symptoms, which are either wont to accompany this Fever, or to come after it. But foraſmuch as ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents often happen, either becauſe the Sick neglected to call the Phiſician in time, or by reaſon of the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs or careleſneſs of the Phyſician, I think it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to treat briefly of their particular Cure, but will confine my ſelf to thoſe Symptoms that require a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Cure proper to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And to begin with a Phrenſie; if the Sick either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of taking hot Medicines unſeaſonably, or by being naturally of too hot a Conſtitution, becomes Light-headed; or which is next to it, if he does not ſleep at all; if he looks and talks fiercely; if he rakes Medicines and common drink greedily, and as it were ſnatches it, and laſtly has a ſuppreſſion of Urine; in this caſe I ſay, I bleed more freely than before, and uſe Gliſters and cooling Medicines oftener, eſpecially in the Spring. And though this Symptom does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in young People, and in thoſe whoſe Blood is brisk, they admit of theſe Remedies without much hazard, and by the uſe of ſuch Remedies I endeavour to keep up the Patient till the Diſeaſe has laſted a while, and then it is not difficult to free him at once of the Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and the Diſeaſe too; and this may be done by giving ſome Narcotick Medicine in a large Doſe; for though when the Fever is at the height, thoſe things that are of a narcotick quality, do no good nor anſwer the Phyſician's end; yet being given ſeaſonably at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Diſeaſe, are very beneficial. But if the uſe of a Narcotick be deferred till the 14th. day, it will do the better. The Narcoticks which I am wont to uſe, are either London Laudanum, from one Grain, to one Grain and an half, or the following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Cowſlip-flowers, one handful, boil them in a ſufficient quantity of black Cherry-water, mix half an ounce of Diacodium and half a ſpoonful of the juice of Lemons, with three ounces of the ſtrained Liquor.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="491" facs="tcp:65404:235"/>
                     <hi>Take of black Cherry-water, one ounce and an half, epidemick Water, two drachms, liquid Laudanum, ſixteen drops, ſyrup of Gillyflowers, one drachm; mingle them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will only add this, which I think worth obſervation, to wit, That if this ſymptom will grant a Truce ſo long, and the Fever continues a long ſpace, ſo that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient may be ſafely purged before the taking of the Anodyne, it will prove more effectual; wherefore, I uſed to order two ſcruples of the Pill Coch. Major diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Bettony-water ten or twelve hours before the taking of the Narcotick; nor is there any danger from the Tumult which that hot Pill would otherwiſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for the vertue of the following Narcotick will appeaſe theſe Commotions, and eſtabliſh moſt gentle and ſweet Peace.</p>
                  <p>But if the Watchings continue after the Fever is gone off, all the other ſymptoms being likewiſe ceaſed, I have obſerved that a Rag dipt in Roſe-water, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied cold to the forepart of the Head and Temples is more beneficial than any Narcotick whatever.</p>
                  <p>It often happens that the Sick is vexed with a Cough through the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe; it is firſt dry, becauſe the Matter being yet thin fruſtrates the expulſive Faculty, but it ſoon grows thick, and is difficulty expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorated, becauſe by degrees it is baked by the febrile heat; and hence it comes to paſs, that the Patient is diſcouraged by fear of choaking, becauſe he wants Strength to cough off this viſcid Matter. In this caſe, I rarely uſe any other Medicine than Oil of ſweet Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds freſh drawn, unleſs it happens (and ſometimes it is ſo) that the Patient has wholly an averſion to Oil, and then we muſt uſe the common Pectorals: But I think Oil of Almonds, if the Patient can bear it, is to be preferred before other Pectorals for this Reaſon chiefly, for that is neceſſary, they are given in a larger quantity, if we would do any thing to the purpoſe, and by this means we overcharge the Stomach, which was too weak before and inclined to be nauſeous; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo, we are hindred upon the ſame account, ſo
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:65404:236"/>
that we cannot mind thoſe things which are to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched at the ſame time. Nor can I underſtand nor learn by experience, why we ſhould abſtain from the uſe of this Oil (which we have now mentioned) in Fevers, becauſe it is inflammable, and therefore to be feared leſt it ſhould increaſe the Fever; for ſuppoſe it naturally hot, yet certainly its heat is not ſo great, but that the advantage of it on another account may compenſate for it; for it is manifeſtly more pectoral than other things, and opens and lubricates the Paſſages, and promotes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration, by which eſpecially if it happens to be large, the Blood is both freed from a troubleſome Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour now conveniently evacuated, and alſo ſomewhat cooled; and, therefore, I am not much concerned, when I perceive this Symptom: But the Oil muſt be given frequently, a little at a time.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the Hickops happen, but moſt commonly to old Men, after large Evacuations, either by Looſneſs, or eſpecially by Vomiting. In this caſe a large doſe of Diaſcordium, <hi>viz.</hi> two drachms, has done the buſineſs, when I could do no good with the ſeeds of Dill, and other things that are cried up as Specificks.</p>
                  <p>If in the courſe of this Diſeaſe a Looſneſs ariſe, which uſes to happen when a Vomit was indicated at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Diſeaſe, and was not taken: In this caſe a Vomit may be given at any time of the Diſeaſe, if the Strength does not contraindicate, tho' the inclination to Vomiting be long ſince paſt. But if a Looſneſs comes, tho' a Vomit has been given, I have found the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gliſter more beneficial than any other Aſtringent whatever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the bark of Pomgranats, half an ounce, of red Roſes, two pugils; boil them in a ſufficient quantity of Cows Milk, diſſolve half an ounce of Diaſcordium in half a pound of the ſtrained Liquor; mingle them, make a Gliſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would not adviſe that a Gliſter ſhould be injected in a greater quantity; for tho' it may be naturally Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, yet there is danger leſt it ſhould weary the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines by its b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>THE Scarlet Fever, tho' it may happen at any time, yet moſt commonly it comes at the latter end of Summer, and ſeizes whole Families, eſpecially Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren: They ſhake and ſhiver at the beginning as in other Fevers, but they are not very ſick; afterwards the Skin is covered with ſmali red Spots, but they are more, and much bigger and redder, and not ſo uniform, as in the Meaſles. Theſe Spots continue two or three days; when they vaniſh and go off, Scales of Skin, like Bran, cover the whole Body.</p>
                  <p>This Diſeaſe ſeems to me to be nothing elſe than a moderate Efferveſcence of the Blood occaſioned by the foregoing Summer, or ſomething elſe; and, therefore, I do nothing that the Blood may not be hindred in its deſpumation and injecting the peccant Matter through the pores of the Skin; only I order, That the Sick ſhould abſtain wholly from Fleſh, and from all ſpirituous Liquors, and that he ſhould not go out, nor contine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf perpetually to his Bed: But after all the Scales are fallen, and the Symptoms ceaſe, I think it is proper to purge the Sick with ſome gentle Medicine agreeable to his Age and Strength; and by this ſimple and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral method, this name of a Diſeaſe, for it is ſcarce any thing elſe, is eaſily removed without trouble or danger; whereas, on the contrary, if we are over officious, by confining the ſick to his Bed continually, and by giving Cordials and other Medicines unneceſſarly, the Diſeaſe is increaſed, and the Patient killed <hi>ſecundum artem.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. CXXII. Of Childrens Fevers.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt Indication in curing Childrens Fevers, is, to prepare well the acid, that it may be the eaſier ejected: But this preparation muſt not be endeavoured by Sudorificks, properly ſo called, that is, ſuch as heat the Body, which are by no means to be uſed for Infants or Children; but ſuch things as abſorbe the acid, and gently reſtrain the Ebullition, are to be uſed; the chief of theſe are Crab's Eyes and Claws, Oiſter-ſhells, Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-bone, Egg-ſhells, Coral, Chalk, Coralline, Pearl, Mother of Pearl, both the Bezoar ſtones, Hartſhorn burnt, burnt Ivory, the bone of a Stag's heart, ſhavings of Hartſhorn, Bole-armenick, ſealed Earth, Blood-ſtone, and the like; and among Compounds, compound Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Crab's Claws, the Goa-ſtone, and Confection of Hyacinth.</p>
                  <p>Being called to an Infant of a year old troubled with a Fever or the Gripes, as they frequently are, I uſed to relieve them with the following Preſcriptions,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the compound Powder of Crab's Claws, and of Pearl prepared, each one drachm; mingle them, make a Powder to be divided into ſix equal parts.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Oriental Bezoar, prepared Pearl, and Crab's Eyes prepared, each half a drachm, of the ſpecies of the confection of Hyacinth, one ſcruple; make a Powder to be divided as before.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the ſimple Powder of Crab's Claws, one drachm, of Crab's Eyes prepared, two ſcruples, of Cochinel, ſix grains; mix them, make a fine Powder to be divided into ſix Papers; let one be taken as ſoon as
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:65404:237"/>
may be, and another two hours after, and afterwards let one be taken every fourth hour for the firſt two days, unleſs the Child be aſleep: But let the Powders be taken in a ſpoonful of the following Julep, and give a ſpoonful preſently after.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Aqua lactis alexiteria, four ounces, of black Cherry-water, two ounces, of compound Peony and epidemick Water, each two drachms, of pearled Sugar, half an ounce; mingle them, make a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lep.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Pennyroyal-water and Aqua lactis alexiteria, each three ounces, of ſyrup of Gillyflowers, 6 drachms, mingle them</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of ſweet Almonds blanched, number ten; beat them in a marble Mortar, and pour upon them gently half a pint of Barley-water, or of Aqua lactis alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iteria; ſtrain it, and add ſix drachms of ſmall Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon-water, half an ounce of white Sugar; mingle them, make a Julep.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes I am wont to uſe, other things being omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a Julep that hath much Pearl in it, but I order that the Glaſs ſhould be well ſhook, before it be poured out.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of black Cherry-water, four ounces, of all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, two ounces, of Aqua mirabilis and prepared Pearls, each two drachms, of white Sugar, half an ounce; mingle them, make a Pearl-julep; give three ſpoonfuls at a time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Child be troubled with the Cough, give half a ſpoonful of ſome pectoral Mixture or Linctus, and let him take leſs of the Powders above-preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Powder of Coralline and ſimple Crab's-claws, each one drachm and an half, of the ſyrups of Maiden-hair and Marſhmallows, each one ounce, of balſam of Tolu, half an ounce, of red Poppy-water, half an ounce; mingle them,</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="496" facs="tcp:65404:238"/>Bole Armenick is often properly mixed with ſuch things to good purpoſe, it powerfully ſtops Catarrhs flowing upon the Lungs; the juice of Pennyroyal heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſweetned with Sugarcandy, is alſo better than moſt other Remedies; Oil of ſweet Almonds is alſo very good, if Children can take it; ſo is Brimſtone, and the Flowers of it.</p>
                  <p>The foreſaid Powders are to be repeated, ſeldom or often, according to the degree of the Symptoms; but it is here to be noted, that the Gripes, Reſtleſſneſs and the Watchings of Children are as eaſily appeaſed by teſtace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Powders, as pains and watchings by Narcoticks in grown People.</p>
                  <p>The third day, unleſs the ſmall Pox, Meaſles or a Scarlet Fever appear, I order a Child of one year old to be purged in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of ſyrup of Succory with Rhubarb, two drachms, of choice Rhubarb powdered, fifteen grains or a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of the Aqua lactis alexiteria, one drachm, of ſmall Cinnamon-water, thirty drops, mingle them.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of ſyrup of Buckthorn, one drachm and an half or two drachms, of the Powder called Diaſenna, eight grains; mingle them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Earl of Warwick's Powder, which is alſo called Pulvis Cornachinus, deſcribed in the laſt Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the London Diſpenſatory, ſix grains; let it be taken in a ſpoonful of black Cherry-water, ſweetned with a little Sugar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of ſweet Almonds blanched, number three; beat them in a marble Mortar, and pour upon them gently an ounce or an ounce and an half of Barley-water, or any other ſimple Water; in the ſtrained Liquor, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve three drachms, or half an ounce of the beſt Manna; mingle them, make a purging Emulſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Lenitive Electuary, two or three drachms, and diſſolve it in an ounce of the Aqua lactis alexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="497" facs="tcp:65404:238"/>Sometimes I order this or the like Plaiſter to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the region of the Navel, eſpecially, if they are troubled with Worms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Succotrine Aloes, one drachm, of the Powder of the leaves of Savin, of the tops of the leſſer Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taury, and of the flowers of Camomil, each one ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with a ſufficient quantity of Venice-turpentine; make a Plaiſter, let the margin of it be ſpread with the Plaiſter of Cummin, to make it ſtick the better; and ſometimes it may be convenient to add to the other Ingredients, a ſcruple of Coloquintida.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no purging Medicine more proper for Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and more innocent than Rhubarb; it gently and ſafely evacuates the Matter occaſioning their Fever, and it gently purges off the Humors that burden the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and whole Body, and it ſtrengthens; wherefore, it is very proper for Infants, Children, big-bellied Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, old Men, and ſuch as have been weakened by Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>After the Purge hath done working, ſome Powder like the former muſt be given in the Evening, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards muſt be repeated three or four times in a day at fit times, for two days, and on the third day Purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be uſed, and it muſt be doſed according to the operation of the former.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being performed, the worſt Symptoms moſt commonly ceaſe, or at leaſt are much abated.</p>
                  <p>It is to be noted, That the firſt Purge we give to Children that have Fevers, muſt not be only Lenitive, but the Doſe of it muſt be leſs than otherwiſe it ought to be; and the night before Purging, a gentle Gliſter, made of four ounces of Cow's Milk, Sugar and a little Salt, muſt be injected, if the Belly be bound.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, to quicken the Purge, a ſcruple or two of Cream of Tartar may be diſſolved in ſome ſpoonfuls of Water-grewel or the like, and ſo given.</p>
                  <p>As to bleeding of Children, tho' it may be uſed, when the febrile Matter is caſt upon the Lungs, or in a hooping Cough, yet it is plain that it is a Remedy not agreeable to their Nature.</p>

                  <p>Being called to a Patient of a Quartan Ague, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, on a Monday, I do nothing if the Fit be to come that day, only I give the Sick hopes that he may be freed from the next Fit; and therefore on the two well days, namely, <hi>Tueſday</hi> and <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> I give the Bark in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Peruvian Bark finely powdered, one ounce, with a ſufficient quantity of Syrup of Gilliflowers, or of dried Roſes, make ad Electuary to be divided into twelve parts, whereof let him take one every fourth hour, beginning preſently after the Fit, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it a draught of ſome Wine.</hi> Or if he likes Pills better,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Peruvian Bark finely powdered, one ounce, with a ſufficient quantity of the Syrup of Gilliflowers, make Pills of a moderate bigneſs, whereof let him take ſix every fourth Hour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But an ounce of the Powder may be eaſier taken, and as ſucceſsfully, mixed with a quart of Claret-wine, eight or nine ſpoonfuls of it being taken every fourth hour. On <hi>Friday</hi> when the Fit is feared, I give nothing, for moſt commonly no Fit comes; but leſt the Diſeaſe ſhould return, eight days exactly after the laſt Doſe, I give the ſame quantity of Powder, <hi>viz.</hi> One Ounce di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into twelve parts, according to the method above-mentioned: But though moſt commonly by giving the Powder after this manner, the Diſeaſe is commonly Cured; yet to ſecure the Patient from a relapſe, it is ſafe to repeat it three or four times, at the ſame inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, eſpecially when the Blood has been weakened by foregoing Evacuations, or by catching Cold.</p>
                  <p>But though this remedy has no purging quality, yet by reaſon of the peculiar Conſtitution of ſome Bodies, it often happens, that the Sick is violently purged by it; in this caſe it is neceſſary to give Laudanum with the
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:65404:240"/>
Powder; wherefore I give ten drops of Laudanum in Wine, after every other Doſe, if the Looſneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.</p>
                  <p>I uſe the ſame method for Tertians and Quotidians; but Tertians and Quotidians often are almoſt continual, and there is only a remiſſion of thoſe days they ſhould intermit, eſpecially when the Sick has been confined to his Bed, and has uſed too hot a Regimen, and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: In this caſe I give the Powder, as ſoon as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any remiſſion.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſome that cannot bear the Bark, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the form of a Powder, nor of an Electuary, nor of Pills; for theſe I infuſe in the cold two Ounces of the Bark groſsly powdered in a quart of Rheniſh-wine, and four Ounces of the Infuſion ſtanding ſome days, ſeem to contain the vertue of one Drachm of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and becauſe it is neither unpleaſant, nor oppreſſes the Stomach, it may be taken as often again as any other form of this Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes it happens, that before this Diſeaſe is come to a regular Type, the Sick cannot retain the Bark in any form, by reaſon of continual Vomiting; in this caſe the Vomiting muſt be firſt ſtopp'd before the Bark can be given, to which end I order, that ſix or eight times in the ſpace of two hours, one ſpoonful of the freſh juice of Limons be taken with a ſcruple of Salt of Wormwood; afterwards I give ſixteen drops of liquid Laudanum in a ſpoonful of ſtrong Cinamon-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſoon after, if the Vomitting ſtop, the Jeſuits Powder. For Infants, whoſe tender Age would ſcarce bear the taking of this remedy in another form, at leaſt ſo much of it as would cure the Diſeaſe; I uſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the following Julep,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Black-cherry-water, and of Rheniſh-wine, each two ounces, of the Peruvian Bark finely powdered, three drachms, of the Syrup of Gilliflowers one ounce, mingle them, make a Julep; let one or two ſpoonfuls of it be taken according to the age, every fourth hour, till the Ague is cured. If there be a Looſneſs, you muſt give a drop or two of liquid Laudanum with every other Doſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="502" facs="tcp:65404:241"/>As to the Diet, the Sick may eat any thing that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with his Stomach, only he muſt avoid cold Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors and Summer Fruits, and let him uſe Wine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately for his ordinary drink, by which alone I have cured ſome Patients that could not be cured with the Jeſuits Powder.</p>
                  <p>The Diſeaſe being taken off, the Sick muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid all evacuations, for the gentleſt Purge, yea, only a Gliſter of Milk and Sugar, will be apt to cauſe a Relapſe.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Amblar,</hi> dwelling at <hi>Mile-end,</hi> a Man of Fifty years of Age, that was lean and ſickly, was often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſubject upon ſlight occaſions, to an obſtinate Ague, accompanied with violent Symptoms, but in the Year, 1690, having taken a great Cold, he was ſuddenly taken with Shaking and Shivering, which was ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an univerſal Chilneſs, during which, his Pulſe could ſcarce be felt; he was alſo violently afflicted with Vomiting, a Looſneſs, and with a horrid oppreſſion and Sickneſs: I viſited him the next Morning, and found his Face plainly Hippocratick; his whole Body was cold as clay, and a Dew upon it, the Skin looked black, by reaſon of the congelation of the Blood, his ſtrength
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:65404:241"/>
was almoſt ſpent by the perpetual Sickneſs, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation of divers coloured Choler by Vomit, and ſtinking white Excrement by Stool, of the conſiſtence of a Cream; all things ſhewed that Death was approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the vital principal, or the animal Spirits, was ſo oppreſſed by the Venom, that there was no hope that they cou'd expand themſelves: But to blunt the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant acrimony of the Humours, I ordered that he ſhould drink Chicken-broath plentifully, and that it ſhould be injected through a Syringe into the <hi>Anus,</hi> I alſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Stomach ſhould be well fomented with Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Bags made hot, and a very cordial Bolus, with as much Laudanum in it as the ſtrength of the Patient would bear, was given with a draught of a Cordial, and alexipharmick Julep, every fourth hour. After the third or fourth Bolus, I perceived the Pulſe was much ſtronger, and the blackneſs of the skin went off, and heat returned to the extream Parts, and the evacuations were ſomething ſuppreſſed, the colliquative Sweat was diminiſhed, and he was more quiet, he ſlept a little, and was not ſo ſick after he waked. After this remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Symptoms, I endeavoured to remove the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, by giving the Jeſuits Powder mixed with Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in the form of a Draught, every fourth hour, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well that the Sick could not bear a ſecond Fit; but before the third Doſe of the Powder, the Fit returned again unexpectedly, accompanied with the former dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Symptoms, and the poor Man died within the ſpace of twenty four Hours.</p>
                  <p>I was called to one Mrs. <hi>Baker,</hi> an ancient Woman dwelling in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> I found her oppreſſed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Sickneſs and Vomiting, and ſo ſhe had been for four days: She preſently vomited up all ſhe took; ſhe fainted often, her Pulſe was quick and Weak; but her temper by reaſon of faintneſs and perpetual ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was moderate, and in ſome ſort cold, her Urine looked in a manner well, ſhe could not reſt, and was almoſt delirious, but ſhe complained only of Nauſeouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Vomiting. Having enquired carefully about every thing, I was told that this Woman had been ſick ſix Weeks, that ſhe was hot and cold by turns, the periods were uncertain, and that ſhe was troubed with
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:65404:242"/>
a Nauſeouſneſs and Vomiting frequently. After I had preſcribed a Cordial, Bolus, and Julep, and Chicken-broath for her ordinary Drink, I ordered a Julep made of Salt of Worm-wood and juice of Limons, to be taken by Spoonfuls, to comfort her Stomach; afterward I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Peruvian Bark ſhould be given freely in the form of a Draught and of a Tincture, adding twice or thrice a day ten or twelve drops of liquid Laudanum, upon the account of the violence of the Vomiting, and in a days time the Sickneſs and Vomiting were leſſened, and critical white Aphtha covered the whole Mouth, the Urine was very red, and other ſigns of the expanſion of the Spirits, and of the feveriſh heat were preſent, and ſoon after a tertian Ague appeared in its proper form, the cold, heat and ſweat ſucceeding one another alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, and after two Fits, the Sick was cured by the Bark.</p>

                  <head>CHAP CXXVI. Of the French-Pox.</head>
                  <p>THE French-pox came firſt from the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> in the Year, 1493. but a violent Gonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhea ſhewed it ſelf firſt about an hundred years ſince. It is propogated either by Generation, as when a Child is infected by the Parents, or by touching of ſome ſoft part, as when a Child is Infected by ſucking a Diſeaſed Nurſe, or a Nurſe by Suckling a Diſeaſed Child, or by a Child's lying in Bed with ſuch as are Infected; but it chiefly comes by impure Coition: But in ſound and firm Conſtitutions impure Coition it ſelf is not always ſufficient to Infect; for ſometimes many lying with an infected Woman, ſome are infected and others not, though they all equally deſerve it. When a Man has to do with an impure Woman, either he has a heat or inflammation of the Penis with Exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

neglected, a Gangren, and chriſtaline Bladders ariſe, and the part Mortifies.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes there is no Gonorrhea, but inſtead of it a Bubo ariſes in the Groin, which according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of its Malignity, either proves eaſily curable, or elſe improves its Venom, and terminates in a pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedenous Ulcer with jagged Lips: There are alſo many vene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>l Ulcers upon the Scrotum and Perineum.</p>
                  <p>A Cancer is commonly attended with breaking out all over the Body like a Flea-biting, which terminates in various ſorts of ulcerous Scabs, or Tete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The pains growing more fixed, Nodes uſually ariſe, and continually afflict them, but towards night grow more intolerable.</p>
                  <p>Co-incident with ſeveral of theſe later degrees, are the noiſe in the Ears, Deafneſs, a Polypus, Opthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, the Fiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ula, Lacrimalis, fierce Catarrhs, Colick, Looſneſs and Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>Authors, upon the entrance of the Pox into Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, generally lookt upon it as not only Incurable, but alſo ſo highly infectious, that they ran away from it as much as the Jews did from the Leproſie; but later Ages and long experience, have made it leſs formidable; yet even to this day, it muſt needs be acknowledged difficult to Cure, in conſideration of its malign and contagious quality, and the ungovernable diſpoſition of the Patients.</p>
                  <p>If the habit of the Body be ſtrong, the cure of all the ſpecies of the Pox, whether they be Chancer, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Tetters, or eating Ulcers, or Ulcers in the Throat and Noſe, are much eaſier cured, than the ſame are in many other chronick Diſeaſes; but to root out the malignity is ſomewhat more difficult.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="507" facs="tcp:65404:243"/>If the Patient has been Clapt formerly, it will be more difficult to cure him the ſecond time, and worſe the third.</p>
                  <p>If he has paſſed through long courſes of Mercurial remedies ineffectually, his Cure will be difficult; and if he has been Salivated by unction, and relapſed, the Cure will be hard, by reaſon the Mercury is become familiar to him, and his Body is for the moſt part waſted.</p>
                  <p>Nodes are more difficultly Cured than any of the Species above mentioned, and thoſe whoſe Bones are corrupted are yet more difficult to cure; but if the habit of the Body be ſtrong, and the Bowels ſound, all the Species of this Diſeaſe are curable, if the Patient keep his Chamber, and ſubmit to the rules of Phyſick and Diet; without which ſubmiſſion we can ſcarce cure the leſſer Species.</p>
                  <p>If the Bowels be unſound, or the Patient hectick, the Diſeaſe is incurable.</p>
                  <p>As to the Cure, though Bleeding does not take off the Diſeaſe, yet in the very beginning of it we uſually let Blood to quiet the fermentation of the humours, and to diſpoſe them for evacuation, and preſcribe a Gliſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after.</p>
                  <p>If the Diſeaſe be of long continuance, and they have been let Blood ſome Months before, yet if we deſign Salivation, we do again let them Blood, if the Body be not too much waſted; for in ſome of thoſe a Fever has happened in the time of raiſing the Salivation, and in Bodies of a Strong habit I have often ſeen them to break out in heat all over in the beginning of the Flux, ſo that then I have been neceſſitated to let them Blood when it was not ſo proper: But when there is a Bubo in the Groin, bleeding is not proper. But purging is more Univerſally neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Of Purges ſome are only lenitive, as Manna with Cream of Tartar in Whey or Poſſet-Drink, Tamarinds, Caſſia, Senna, Rhubarb, lenitive Electuary and the like. Stronger Purges are theſe that follow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Leavs of Sena four ounces, of Gummy Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith, Hermodactiles, each two ounces, of black Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore,

The Doſe is half a Drachm or a Drachm.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Pil. Coch. min. A Scruple or half a Drachm, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius Dulcis twenty Grains, make ſix Pills.</hi> Or</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the extract above mentioned, of Gum Guiacum half a Scruple, of Mercurius Dulcis one Scruple, with Syrup of Buck-thorn make pills.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vomiting is of uſe in great diſorders of the Stomach, when the foulneſs of that requires it, or when the Ulcers of ſome particular part require a ſudden revulſion; ſo likewiſe when after the uſe of much Mercury outward or inward to Salivate, it does not riſe kindly; they generally give ſtrong Vomits if the party can bear them, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome preparations of Mercury, as Turbith, Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the like, or Crocus Metallorum: But in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conſtitutions, ſuch as we may.</p>
                  <p>The next thing which offers it ſelf to our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Salivation, without which few great Cures are done in this Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The methods of Salivating are diverſe, but all by Mercury. Inwardly are preſcribed various preparations of Mercury. When we deſign Salivation by Mercurius dulcis, we give it from twenty to twenty five grains, and ſometimes to thirty, either in a ſpoonful of white Bread and Milk, or in conſerve of red Roſes, or the like; when we ſuſpect it may worke by Stool, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it with Diaſcordium or Venice-Treacle at Bed time. If after taking of it four or five Days, their Chops do not ſwell, it may be reaſonable to move it
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:65404:244"/>
upward with a few grains of Turbith Mineral; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their Chops ſwell, they will Salivat; if their Mouths be much ulcerated and ſwelled, the Salivation may laſt eighteen or twenty Dayes, during which they are to be kept warm, eſpecially about their Head Neck and Chops, and to drink Chicken Broath or Poſſet Ale.</p>
                  <p>Arcanum Corallinum, as it is generaly ſold in the Shops, may be given from three grains to five, one Doſe of it preſcribed to a Woman Vomited her often, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livated twenty Days.</p>
                  <p>Red Precipitat. is alſo Vomitive, but being well waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may be taken as ſafely as the white Precipitat. White Precipitat may be given proportionably as has been ſaid of Mercurius dulcis. Turbith Mineral made of Vigo's Precipitat is beſt, twelve or 18 grains of it may be taken at a time, but that which is ſold in the Shops is a rough Medicine, and muſt be given in a leſs quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo a way of raiſing a Salivation by ſuffumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, the preſcription whereof is as follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Cinnabar two ounces, of Crude Mercury one ounce, of Maſtich, Frankincenſe, and Sandarach, each half an ounce, of Storax, Calamit, and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoin, each three drachms; make a fine powder of all, and with Turpentine make Troches, each weighing three drachms for uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when the Pox is grown inveterate and affects the moſt ſolid parts with Node's, and the like, Salivation by unction muſt be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Lard two ounces, of Crude Mercury one ounce, mix them well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You muſt begin the unction in the following manner; the Patient muſt lodge in a cloſe warm Chamber; if the Seaſon be cold, the Windows muſt be covered with Blankets, and the Bed muſt be placed near the Fire, and encompaſſed with a Skreen, if the Chamber be large; you ought alſo to have a ſtrong healthy Nurſe,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:65404:245"/>
ſuch as has been accuſtomed to the employment, that ſhe may know how to waſh the Patients Mouth, and direct and encourage him in ſuch rules, as may be neceſſary in the time of Salivating.</p>
                  <p>The moſt proper place for unction is a Stove, if it may be had, and the Patient can bear it; if he be weak, his Bed muſt be uſed, otherwiſe for want of a Stove, he muſt ſit encompaſſed with a Screen by the Fire ſide, but not too near it. He muſt anoint himſelf, begining at the Feet, and then the Legs, Thighs, Hips, and ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taking in the Arms and Shoulders; the Belly muſt not be anointed, and indeed much of the trouble in weak Bodys may be ſpared; for in ſuch the anointing of the Legs and Arms may be ſufficient, the parts firſt anointed ought to be covered before you proceed to the next, as the Legs with Stockings, the Thighs with Trouſſes and the like; at laſt his Neck muſt be well wrapp'd with a Napkin tacked up to his Cap round about to his Ears and faſtened before to keep his Chops warm; after this a warm Bed will be convenient and a Draught of Poſſet-drink to procure a breathing ſweat; having repoſed himſelf an hour or two he may riſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his Dinner, which muſt conſiſt of Meat of eaſie digeſtion Roaſt or Boyl'd, at his Dinner he may drink Beer or Ale with a Toaſt, the reſt of the Day he muſt be confin'd to Poſſet-drink.</p>
                  <p>You muſt uſe a third part of the Ointment at a time and continue dayly to uſe it for three Days following; when the Patient ſpits you muſt keep him to Poſſet-drink or Chicken-Broath, alſo a Cordial muſt be at Hand to prevent fainting, his Mouth muſt be ſyringed with Barly-Water and Liquorice and the like. New Milk held in his Mouth or Chicken-Broath will eaſe the pain and digeſt the Sloughs that riſe; a rolled Clout ought to be placed between his Teeth to keep his Chops from cloſing; he muſt be rais'd high in the Bed if his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſtrain him to it, and kept forward that the Rheum may run out of his Mouth and not down his Throat; but if he can riſe he will ſpit the better and more plentifully. Salivation by unction commonly laſts twenty four or twenty five Days; ſometimes to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="511" facs="tcp:65404:245"/>In the hight of it our work is to keep up the ſtrength, and if through Coſtiveneſs they Spit little, give them a Gliſter, that they may Spit better, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the waſhing their Mouths; but as the Sloughs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſeparate, which will be towards the declenſion of the Salivation, preſcribe them a decoction of Sarſa or the like, to drink at leaſt thrice a day; and before the Slough is quite caſt off, purge them, and as they are able to eat Meat, put them into a drying diet, and ſweat them, as ſhall be ſhewed in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>It happens ſometimes in anointing, that their Mouths are much Ulcerated, and their Breath ſmells ſtrong, yet their Cheeks do not ſwell, nor do they Spit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably; in which caſe, forbear the anointing, and conſider the cauſe of it, and if the body be ſtrong and plethorick, Vomit them with Turbith, or infuſion of Crocus metallorum: But if they are weak or coſtive, adminiſter a Gliſter; and if afterwards it riſe not, diſpoſe them to Sweat with draughts of warm Poſſet Ale, or bath them; for that way it will ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, when with the other it will not. But if they have faintneſs, palpitation of the Heart, ſhortneſs of Breath, Fever and the like, your beſt way will be to purge it off, with an infuſion of Sena, and the like with the aditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Syrup of Roſes ſolutive, or of Syrup of Buckthorn, and keep up their Spirits the while with Cordials, and good Broaths; if their Lungs be oppreſt, let them Blood, and preſcribe Lohochs; but if there be alſo a ſuppreſſion of Urine, or if they make but little and high coloured, purge them with <hi>Barnet</hi> or <hi>Epſom</hi> Water turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Poſſet, and quicken it with ſome purging Syrup. If by theſe ways of purging the accidents remit, and the Salivation riſes, it is well; but if it does not, yet there being a colliquation made, you may by well purging, ſtrict diet, ſweating and the like, obtain your end. While you are removing the aboveſaid acciden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, you muſt have a ſpecial regard to the Ulcers within their Mouths; for it is from the fixing of the Mercury, that thoſe malign Ulcers are made, which the leſs ſenſible they are of them the more corrupt they are. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by raiſing the Salivation by unction, it paſſes downwards by Stool, in which caſe, we preſcribe
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:65404:246"/>
Venice-Treacle, Diaſcordium, Laudanum, Opiatum and the like, which being given at Night will not only ſtrengthen their Bowels. but diſpoſe them to reſt, and incourage them to go on in the anointing, a Vomit of Turbith mineral. After the unction has been ſome while uſed, does frequently raiſe the Salivation, and after it is well raiſed, you may heighten, or continue it by the application of ſome of the following Plaſters: But if after all your endeavours to raiſe the Salivation it does diſcharge it ſelf by a looſneſs, with great eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, you are then to defend the Inteſtins from the acrimony of the humours, by Gliſter of Chicken-broath, leſt the bloody Flux follows. Inwardly we preſcribe large draughts of Chicken-Broath, a Decoction of burtnt Hearts-horn, and Milk-water boyled with a Stick of Cinnamon.</p>
                  <p>After the Flux is ſtopt, you muſt conſider the ſtrength of the Patient, and if the Sick be very weak, you muſt not inſiſt upon Fluxing, but proceed with Sudorificks, and the like, not doubting of ſucceſs in the Cure; for ſuch a looſneſs does for the moſt part contribute as much to the Cure, as if they had Salivated.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another way of Fluxing, and that is by the application of Mercurial Plaſters about the Arms Legs, and the like; they were firſt deſigned I ſuppoſe for the more tender, and delicate ſort of People, who would not admit of the unction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Diachylon with Orris one pound, of Red-Lead Plaſter eight ounces, of Gum Carranna, and Taca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mahaca, each four ounces, of Benzoin, Storax Calamit, and Ambar, each two ounces, of Liquid-ſtorax, and of Peruvian Balſam, each a ſufficient quantity; mingle them over the Fire, and when it is removed from the Fire, add eight ounces of Crude Mercury extinguiſhed with Turpentine; make a Plaſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe being ſpread upon a Cloath thick, and applyed, you muſt then put them into a warm Bed, and with a draught of warm Poſſet-drink, ſweat them dayly, and treat them, as has been ſaid, in the Salivation by uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:65404:246"/>
If it ariſe not by the firſt Plaſters, you muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply freſh once in four or five days; and if there be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion you may haſten the Salivation by a few grains of Turbith Mineral. I have ſometimes Salivated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by theſe Plaſters, but for the moſt part, I uſe them to raiſe a Salivation, or continue it in ſuch, where I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it with internals, and for that purpoſe they are of excellent uſe.</p>
                  <p>The humours being evacuated by Salivation and purging, ſweating will be neceſſary; they may ſweat in Bed or out of it; the Bed is proper for the weaker ſort, and there they may ſweat with Bottles of hot wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Bricks heated and placed about them; or they may ſweat under a Frame; if they ſweat with Bottles or Bricks, they muſt have many Cloaths, as Blankets and the like to cover them cloſe, and the Bottles or Bricks may be wrapped in Napkins, and applyed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as you deſign to ſweat, more particularly any one part; generally they are placed one each ſide near the Armpits, Hips, and at the Soles of the Feet. If you ſweat with Bricks, let them be heated rather by boyling Water than Fire, leſt in the Bed they burn the Patient.</p>
                  <p>The way by a Frame is this, you are to fold a well aired Sheet four double, and lay it under the Patient; then his Shirt being ſtripped off, the Frame muſt be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced over him, and a Sheet over the Frame, and Blankets over that Sheet and both Sheet, and Blankets muſt be brought over the end of the Frame, and be tucked down cloſe to the Neck; then a Pan of well burnt Charcoal, or Spirit of Wine muſt be put in the lower end of the Frame; this being done ſhut the Door, and take care that the heat be kept in. His Head ought alſo to be covered warm that it may ſweat; if he took not his Sudorifick before, he muſt take it now, the Diet-drink muſt be warmed, and may be commodiouſly given with a Glaſs pipe; a couple of Servants muſt attend the Patient dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his being in the Frame, the one of them muſt attend him with a warm Napkin to wipe the ſweat off his Face, and to give him Cloaths to rub his Body with, which Cloaths ought to be thruſt in and taken out at one ſide of the Frame; this Servant ought to have regard
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:65404:247"/>
his Maſter, that upon the leaſt complaint, he may give warning to his fellow to renew the Fire, or to take it out according as there ſhould be occaſion. The Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, and the Sheet next the Frame ſomewhat cool, one of the Servants muſt hold the Cloaths cloſe to the Patients Neck and Shoulders, whilſt the other draws the Frame away. Then ſhall they both tack the Blankets and Covering cloſe to him, and give him another draught of his Diet-drink, and continue him in his ſweat half an hour or more, if he can admit it; then gradually cool him, and pull away the wet folded Sheet from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; then rub him with dry Cloaths and put on his Shirt; and if he be diſpoſed to ſlumber an hour he may; otherwiſe he may riſe and Dine at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. They commonly ſweat three quarters of an hour in the Frame, and an hour in Bed, after the Frame is pulled away.</p>
                  <p>The ways of ſweating out of Bed are by Stove, Tub, Chair, or Cradle; the Stove is moſt eaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y in regard they may ſit, ſtand, or walk up and down; but when they go out of them to Bed, there is danger of taking cold.</p>
                  <p>Bathing is of great uſe in this Diſeaſe, whether it be new or old; in dry Bodies, where the Diſeaſe has been long confirmed, bathing is neceſſary to diſpoſe them to Salivation; it is alſo proper after the Patient has paſt through the ſtrict courſe of Salivation, purging and ſweating; the Body being thereby dryed and waſted is hereby cooled, moiſtned, and reſtored to its natural temper.</p>
                  <p>In order to bathing, we generally let blood and purge, if there be a Plethoria; but when the Body is waſted and dry, a Gliſter may ſerve: Before the Patient enters into the Bath he may drink a draught of Caudle or Broath, and in the Bath he may take a ſpoonful or two of Harts-horn-Gelly, or the like.</p>
                  <p>The Veſſel we bath in is a Tub wherein the Patient may ſit up to the Neck, for want of ſuch a Barrel may ſerve, the one end being beat out, and a ſtool placed in it to ſit on; the bath Liquor is according to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and quality of the ſick. Sometimes it is all Milk, other times Milk and Water, or only Water with a Bag
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:65404:247"/>
of Wheaten Bran, which ſerves the Patient as a cuſhion and makes the water milky: They are ſometimes Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed with Wood of <hi>Caſſia,</hi> Rhodium, yellow Sanders, and the like. The Baths of Milk are apt to ſowre, therefore ought to be renewed daily; the other will laſt longer ſweet. In the time of Bathing, there ought to be plenty of hot and cold water, to continue the Bath of a moderate temper, neither too hot nor too cold; ſome Hoops ſhould be faſtened over the head of the Tub, whereon a Blanket or Sheet as a Canopy may be caſt, in caſe the Air be cold; a Servant or two ought alſo to be attending in caſe of Fainting, leſt he ſink into the Water; therefore upon his complaint, raiſe him up, and caſting a Sheet about him, put him into a warm Bed, where he may refreſh himſelf, and at his pleaſure riſe and cloath himſelf, and Dine or Sup, as his appetite requires. Bathing may be uſed twice a day, but never upon a full Stomach.</p>
                  <p>During the cure of this Diſeaſe, it will be requiſite that the Patient keep his Chamber, and that it be made temperately warm; the taking of Phyſick and ramb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling abroad in the Cold being extreamly prejudicial to their Cure, and is frequently attended with a Looſneſs and noiſe in the Ears and Deafneſs There is alſo a ſpecial care to be taken concerning their Diet, that on thoſe days they Purge, their Dinner be of good Nouriſhment, Boiled or Roaſted. We alſo allow them good Broath, and Beer or Ale to raiſe their Strength, ſo as they may be able to bear the evacuation which is required. But in the time of their Sweating, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine them to a very ſlender and drying Diet, only ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupport their Spirits. A Chop of a Neck of Mutton or two Ribs dry Roaſted, was the old ſtint. I permit them to make choice of one ſort of Meat, and keep them to it; which among the better ſort is, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, and that without Sawce, their Suppers may be Bisket, Raiſins of the Sun, and a few blanched Almonds, and their Drink a Decoction of Sarſa, and the like; but in weak and extenuated Bodies, China Broath, or a mixture of Milk with their Diet-drink may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>

                     <pb n="516" facs="tcp:65404:248"/>Exerciſe is of uſe in the beginning of this Diſeaſe, and may ſerve to rouſe the native heat, and to thruſt forth the malignity, and waſte ſuperfluities; but after the Diſeaſe is more confirmed, violent exerciſe is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>Sleep is allowed in the day to refreſh them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part diſturbed in the night by their Pains, which are therefore called Nocturnal.</p>
                  <p>Venery ought to be avoided, and the Paſſions of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>As to a Gonorrhea, the main of the Cure is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Purging; but becauſe the Diſeaſe is accompanied with an Inflammation, and cured by Purging Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that are hot, cooling Diet muſt be ordered through the whole Courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the maſs of the Pill Coch. Major, three drachms, of Extract of Rudius, one drachm, of roſin of Julap, and Diagridium, each half a drachm, with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity of Opobalſamum; make ſix Pills of every drachm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sick muſt take four of them at four or five a Clock in the Morning, and ſleep upon them for twelve or fourteen days or more, till the heat of Urine and the yellow colour of the Matter be much leſſened; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards every other day for a Fortnight, and afterwards twice a Week, till the Humour quite ſtop, which will not be done till a long time, though it be commonly affirmed, that that Ichor that is ſeen eſpecially in a Morning at the top of the Yard being preſſed, proceeds only from a looſneſs of the parts, by reaſon of the long continuance of the running: Yet the Sick will find it otherwiſe, if he neglect Purging before it is quite gone: For upon any ſmall occaſion, as by immoderate Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, violent Exerciſe, or the like, the Gonorrhea will return.</p>
                  <p>But if the Gonorrhea does not yield to ſuch kind of Purging, it will be proper inſtead of Pills, eſpecially if the Sick are difficultly Purged, to give betwixt whiles ſome more powerful Medicines, as is the following Purge.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. CXXVII. Of the Itch, and Spots and Pimples in the Face.</head>
                  <p>OFten and conſtant eating of ſalt Fiſh or Fleſh, and dryed in the Sun, alſo Drinks that are diſagreeable and poyſonous, do commonly cauſe cutaneous erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; alſo the Humour gathered in the cutaneous Glands, ſometimes by meer Stagnation, becomes not only itchy, but oftentimes corruptive; wherefore, not only they that have been long kept in Priſon, but alſo they that have liv'd a Sedentary Life and are uſed to Filth and Stinks, are ſubject to theſe Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>As to the cure of the Itch, there are two primary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications; Firſt, that the glandulous Humour be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a due diſpoſition. Secondly, that the pores of the Skin be freed from ichorus concretions.</p>
                  <p>The preſervative Indication reſpects theſe two things. Firſt that the itchy Humour does not regurgitate upon the Blood and nervous Liquor. Secondly, that itchy Humour, if it be fallen upon the noble Parts, be era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.</p>
                  <p>All theſe intentions of Healing, ought to be compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, or at leaſt provided for by turns, by external and internal Remedies. You muſt begin and end with Purging; and Bleeding, if nothing contra-indicates, muſt be uſed at the beginning. Alteratives muſt be alſo uſed, and Liniments and Baths, or Topicks of other kinds. I will ſet down ſome choice forms of Medicines of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind, and firſt as to Purges; a Purge or a Vomit muſt be given at the beginning, and after bleeding, (if it be uſed) a purging Apozem, or Diet-Drink, muſt be taken for ſeven or eight days.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="523" facs="tcp:65404:251"/>
                     <hi>Take of the Electuary, called Diacarthamum, three drachms, of the Species called Diaturbith with Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, one drachm, of Cream of Tartar and Salt of Wormwood, each half a Scruple, of the purging Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Apples a ſufficient quantity; make a Bolus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Sulphur of Antimony grains ſeven, of Scammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſulphurated, grains eight, of Cream of Tartar, half a ſcruple; make a Powder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the Roots of Polipody of the Oak, of ſharp-pointed Dock prepared, each one ounce, of the leaves of Sena ten drachms, of Turbith, Agarick, and Dodder of Thyme, each one ounce, of the ſeeds of Carthamus half an ounce, of yellow Sanders two drachms, of the Seeds of Aniſe and Caraways, each two drachms, cut them and beat them, and digeſt them hot in two quarts of White-wine in a Veſſel cloſe ſtopped for twenty four hours; pour off the clear Liquor without preſſing. The Doſe is ſix ounces, either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or with a ſpoonful of the Syrup of Dodder of Thyme.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take the fore-ſaid Ingredients and boyl them in three quarts of Fountain-water till half is conſumed, then add a pint of White-wine, ſtrain it preſently to be taken as before.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the roots of Polypody of the Oak, of ſharp-pointed Dock, each three ounces, of the beſt Sena four ounces, of Dodder of Thyme, Turbith, and Mechoacan, each two ounces, of yellow Sanders one ounce, of Coriander-ſeeds ſix drachms, prepare them according to Art, make a Bag for four Gallons of Ale, after five or ſix days Tap it, and take three quarters of a pint, more or leſs every morning for eight or ten days.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ordinary drink provide four gallons of ſmall Ale, and hang in a Bag in it the following Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="524" facs="tcp:65404:252"/>
                     <hi>Take of the tops of Tamarisk and Fumitory dryed, each four handfuls, of the roots of ſharp-pointed Dock dryed ſix ounces, of the bark of Woody Night-ſhade two ounces, cut and beat them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to altering Remedies, there is little need of others beſides the altering drink above preſcribed; only the Patient muſt obſerve a good courſe of Diet, he muſt forbear ſalt and peppered Meats, Shell-fiſh, and ſuch as are Pickled; alſo Wine, Strong-waters and ſtrong Beer.</p>
                  <p>As to Ointments, the following is commonly uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of the powder or flower of Brimſtone, half an ounce, of Butter that is not Salted, four ounces, of Ginger powdered half a drachm, make a Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The following is neater, though not much more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Ointment of Roſes four ounces, of Brimſtone half an ounce, of the Oil of Tartar </hi> per deliquium, <hi>a ſufficient quantity, make a Liniment; you may perfume it with a ſcruple of Oil of Rhodium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But after all, I have found by much Experience, that Quick-ſilver Girdles (though they are generally much diſliked) are moſt effectual for curing the Itch, and as Safe as any other Medicine, if they are prepared in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Quick-ſilver three quarters of an ounce, the White of one new laid Egg, beat them together in a woodden Diſh with a Stick two hours, then ſpread it on a Girdle of new Flannel the breadth of three Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; you muſt ſpread it all by degrees and dry it in the Sun, or by a moderate Fire, and it muſt be worn a Month or ſix Weeks, being ſewed ſtrait round the Waſte; the ſide whereon the Mercury is being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:65404:252"/>
to the Body. </hi> The Patient muſt be Purged once before the uſe of the Girdle, and once after the Itch is cured.</p>
                  <p>And by this ſhort and eaſie Method, I have cured whole Families infected with the Itch, and never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the leaſt Injury, though I have uſed it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeveral Years.</p>
                  <p>The following Water is excellent for taking off Spots and Pimples from the Face, and the redneſs of it, and that blackneſs which looks like Gunpowder in the Face, eſpecially about the Noſe and Fore-head, which is ſometimes the black heads of Worms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take of Sublimate one ounce, put it into a tin Pot with three pints of Fountain-water, let them ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther twenty four hours, ſtir them now and then with a Stick, till all the Liquor looks black; filter it through Paper, and with a Feather or the like dipt in it, touch the Face gently once in a day or two.</hi>
