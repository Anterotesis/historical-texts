            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> publiſhed a Book, called his Diſcovery of Witchcraft, in the beginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for the inſtruction of all Judges, and Juſtices of thoſe times; which Book did for a time take great impreſſion in the Magiſtracy, and alſo in the Clergy, but ſince that time <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath ſhamefully fallen from the Truth which they began to receive; wherefore here is again a neceſſary and illuſtrious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for the Magiſtracy, and other People of this Age, where I intreat all to take notice, that many do falſly report of Mr. <hi>Scot,</hi> that he held an Opinion, that Witches are not, for it was neither his Tenent, neither is it mine; but that Witches are not ſuch as are commonly executed for Witches.</p>

            <p>SInce the time that I have tryed to bring truth upon the ſtage of the world, to be cenſured by all men, I being acquainted with but few in compariſon of all, and ſome of them knowing my intent to put this diſcourſe in Print, I have neerly gueſſed by common diſcourſe amongſt them, what the cenſure of this book will be, that is, it will be the ſame among many, that it is among few; for among few, I find ſome ſo reaſonable in their diſcourſe, that when they find by argumentation, that there is reaſon and grounds in the Scripture for what I write, they upon ſecond cogitations, and deliberate muſings, have yeelded to this truth, (and ſome of them very learned.) Some again, after ſome ſerious argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being fully convinced that this is the very truth, yet doe ſtill ſuſpend their cenſure, till they ſee how it will be approved of by others, by which they ſhew they are ready at all times, to beleeve as the Church beleeves, and to pin their opinion upon the ſleeve of other mens judgements. A third ſort there are, who at the firſt on-ſet of diſcourſe, do think themſelves ſo ſurely grounded, and this truth ſo groundleſſe and vain an opinion, as that they cannot ſpeak without diſdain, as great <hi>Goliah</hi> ſpake to little <hi>David,</hi> and thus they beginne in fury, O groſſe! what madneſſe is this? what will you deny the Scriptures? what anſwer you to this? Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Witch to live: but when they are ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly anſwered, and ſuddenly convinced, that this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh nothing for them, and that this their great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion-argument, hath ſo ſoon received a ſtone in the forehead, they either let their diſcourſe fall to the ground like <hi>Goliah,</hi> and ſlight this as a new opinion; or elſe they runne away cowardly, like the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65492:6"/>
hoſt of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and forſake the Scriptures (which they firſt pretended ſhould be their only weapon to fight withall) and betake themſelves to their leggs, runing into ſome vain ſtory taken out of <hi>Bodinus</hi> or <hi>Bat. Spineus,</hi> or ſome ſuch popiſh vain wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and report that it was done in <hi>Lancaſhier,</hi> or in <hi>Weſtmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or in ſome remote place farre off; and that they heard it credibly reported from men of worth and quality, and ſo they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage me to anſwer to a ſtory, which they would compell me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, or elſe to goe ſee where it was done; but if it happeneth (as often it doth) that I make it appear by Scripture, that it is abſurd or impoſſible, not to be reported by a Chriſtian, or that I ſhew them the ſtory, in any of the aforeſaid Authors, who have been the Authors of many vain fables, then they preſently fly to another ſtory, as vain and abſurd as the former, and that being anſwered, they fly to another, ſaying, Sir, what do you anſwer to this? in which manner of diſputes I have heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuch monſtrous impoſſibilities reported and affirmed to be true, (for they had it by credible report) as would make the Angells in Heaven bluſh to hear them. Therefore ſetting aſide all ſuch unſcholar-like way of arguing, I deſire all to argue by the Scriptures, and I will anſwer, or to anſwer by the Scriptures, and I will argue by the Scriptures, as followeth in this Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</p>

            <head>A DILEMMA THAT Cannot bee anſwered by VVITCH-MONGERS. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.4, 8, 12.</head>
            <p>CHriſt who is our forerunner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. by whoſe holy Spirit the holy Scriptures were written, whoſe words were of equall truth and authority with the Scriptures; Yet when he was to conquer the father of lies, the Prince of darkneſſe (not for his own ſake, but for our example) although hee was able to have argued by common reaſon, beyond the wiſedome of <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet being tempted, would not anſwer any one temptation without <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> it is written (becauſe the Scriptures are the only rule of righteouſneſſe;) whoſoever then will take example by him, to try the Truth by Scriptures, and to argue by them, as he did in this place of <hi>Luke,</hi> (and not by ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, which are the objects of vain credulity) let them anſwer me by <hi>Scriptum eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Where is it written in all the old and new Teſtament, that a Witch is a murtherer, or hath power to kill by Witchcraft, or to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with any diſeaſe or infirmity?</p>

            <p n="5">5 Where is it written, that the tryall of a Witch ſhould be by ſinking or ſwimming in the water? or by biggs or privy marks, or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of people, to be ſignes of a Witch?</p>
            <p n="6">6 Where is it written, that Witches can hurt corn or cattell, or tranſport corn by Witchcraft, or can fly in the aire, and do many ſuch ſtrange wonders?</p>
            <p n="7">7 Where is it written, that a Witch is ſuch a man or woman that maketh a league with the Devill, written with his or her blood, and by vertue of that covenant to have the Devill at command?</p>
            <p n="8">8 Where is it written, that any man or woman was called in the Scripture <hi>ſtrix.</hi> or <hi>lamia,</hi> or where is any word of ſuch ſignification or importance, either in the Hebrew text, or in the Latin tranſlation, where is a Witch ſaid in the Scriptures to be any ſuch kind of perſon?</p>

            <p n="10">10 Where is it written, that there are any other ſorts of Witches than ſuch as are there deſcribed? <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Where do we read of a he devill, or a ſhe devill, called <hi>incubus</hi> or <hi>ſuccubus,</hi> that uſeth generation or copulation with Witches, or VVitches with them?</p>
            <p n="12">12 It is written, Woe unto ſuch as devour widdows houſes, and in a pretence make long prayers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.14.</p>
            <p n="13">13 It is written, the Lord hateth the hand that ſheddeth innocent blood, and the falſ witneſs that ſpeaketh lies, and the feet that are ſwift to do miſcheif, and a heart that deviſeth wicked imaginations, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6. 17 18, 19.</p>
            <p n="14">14 It is written, ſhall there be evill in a City and the Lord hath not done it? <hi>Amos.</hi> 3.6.</p>
            <p n="15">15 It is written, there is no God with me, I kill and I make alive; I wound, and heal, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39. and again, the Lord killeth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth alive; hee bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up; the Lord maketh poore, and maketh rich, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6, 7.</p>
            <p n="16">16 It is written, If ye were blind yee had had no ſinne, but now ye ſay ye ſee, therefore your ſinne remaineth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.41.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65492:8"/>17 It is written, Becauſe they received not the love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved; therefore God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they ſhould beleeve lies, that they might be damned that beleeved not the Truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="18">18 It is written, Thou ſhalt not raiſe a falſe report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witneſſe, <hi>Exodus</hi> 23.1.</p>
            <p n="19">19 It is written, If ye any way afflict the widdow or the fatherleſſe, and they cry at all unto me, I will ſurely hear their cry; and my wrath ſhal wax hot, and I will kill you with the ſword, and your wives ſhall be widdows, and your children fatherleſſe, <hi>Exodus</hi> 22.23, 24.</p>
            <p n="20">20 It is written, God ſaw that the imaginations of the thoughts of mens hearts were only evill continually; &amp; it repented the Lord that he had made man, &amp; therefore he deſtroyed the old world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5, 6, 7,</p>
            <p>Therefore you that are of the ſacred order of the miniſtry; that do uſe to cry to the people, give ear with fear and reverence to the word of God, as it is written in the text, how dare ye teach for doctrin, the traditions of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> that are not written in the Book of God?</p>
            <p>Whether do not ſome preferre the mad imaginations of <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> and others, before the Scriptures, for the defending their opinions?</p>

and theſe nine appellations in the tenth and eleventh verſes, are not tearms of diſtinction, but ſeveral terms of deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby to diſcern falſe Prophets, or Witches, whom the Lord would have cut off from among his people; and thorefore the Lord deſcribeth them in the tenth and eleventh verſes, ſheweth the deſtruction of the Nations that hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, in the 12, 13, &amp; 14. verſes (where alſo he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth his people to be holy, and not like thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) promiſeth that his people ſhould always have a true Prophet amongſt them to hearken unto, in the 15, 16, 17, &amp; 18. verſes (which although it was fulfilled in Chriſt chiefly, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.23. yet it is meant, and alſo verified of all the reſt of the Prophets, that were ſucceſsively Meſsengers of Chriſt from <hi>Moſes,</hi> till the coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh) comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to hearken to ſuch a Prophet, in the nineteenth verſe, but for all falſe Prophets, the Lord will have them cut off in the twentieth verſe, and ſetteth down a trial, and a diſcerning rule between a true Prophet, and a falſe Prophet that ſpeaketh in Gods Name, in the one and twentieth and two and twentieth verſes, as appeareth orderly in the chapter, who ſo pleaſeth to read it.</p>

               <p>That it is a Craft truly ſo called, and likewiſe that it is for gain is proved, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.16, 19, the Maid that followed <hi>Paul</hi> crying, brought in her Maſter much gain; and that it is a craft of perverting the people, or ſeducing them from God and his Truth, is proved, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.6, 7, 8. <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer laboured to pervert the Deputy from the Faith. So likewiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 8, 9, 10, 11. verſes, it doth more plainly prove all in theſe words, And there was a man before in the City called <hi>Simon,</hi> which uſed Witchcraft, and bewitched the people of <hi>Samaria,</hi> ſaying that he himſelf was ſome great man, to whom they gave heed from the leaſt to the greateſt, ſaying, This man is the great power of God, and gave heed unto him, becauſe that of long time he had bewitched them with Sorceries; How bewitched them with Sorceries?

O fooliſh <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians</hi> who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth? and that a Witch, or Witchcraft is taken in no other ſenſe in all the Scripture, it appeareth by the whole current of the Scriptures, as you may ſee in this Book.

               <p>The firſt Reaſon is, becauſe as the ſetting up of an Idol is Witch-craft, ſo where Idols are, there muſt needs bee Witches; namely South-ſayers, or Idol Prieſts, or elſe the Idol of it ſelf can do nothing; as when it is ſaid in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>Ahaziah</hi> ſent to inquire of the god of <hi>Ekron,</hi> it is not to be ſuppoſed that there could be an anſwer given by the bare Idol (being but a ſtock) but the anſwer or Divination muſt come from the Prieſts and South-ſayers, that were there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that Idol, and upholding it.</p>

               <head>A Queſtion reſolved.</head>
               <p>SEeing it is manifeſt by the Scriptures, as appeareth in this ſecond deſcription of a Witch, that he that uſeth Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is a Witch, and one main pretence in giving Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was Dreams and Viſions of the night, then it may bee ſuppoſed that he that telleth a Dream to his neighbour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fore-telling things to come, uſeth Divinations, and ought to bee cenſured as a Witch, or elſe muſt needs bee a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
               <p>To this it is anſwered, That Dreams in the Scripture do appear to be of two ſorts, the firſt ſort were Prophetical, wherein men had a direct command from God to go and Propheſie to the people, and theſe Dreams came ordinarily to the Prophets, upon ſo many ſeveral occaſions as were needful for the Prophets to admoniſh the people, to ſhew them their ſins, and declare the truth to them, and for the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65492:13"/>
declaring of future things to the people, either concerning Judgements of God that would come upon them for their ſins if they did not amend, or concerning ſome great work, that God would do for his people that feared him, and theſe Dreams were proper to the Prophets only, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.6. and they that did falſly pretend ſuch Dreams, and Inſpirations, to diſſemble the Prophets, to ſeduce the people to Idolatry were Witches, or falſe Prophets, according to this ſecond deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of uſing lying Divinations, and ought to bee ſlain, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.1.5.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſecond ſort of Dreams that we read of in the Scriptures were warning Dreams, whereby men were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned of things to come, but were not thereby ſent to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie to the people by ſpecial command from God, but were forewarned; Firſt, for the avoyding of danger that might come upon them, or others whom this Dream concerned, or at the leaſt that they might know the danger before it came, and theſe Dreams were common to many as well as to the Prophets, both to the godly and ungodly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.12, 13 and 27.19. <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.8. and Chap. 41. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.1. Secondly, theſe ſort of warning Dreams fore-ſhewed a bleſſing upon the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to encourage them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.5.9. and for theſe ſorts of Dreams, we read by theſe examples in the Scriptures, that they are common to all ſorts of people, and uſeful either to hear, or to declare, but whoſoever did declare a Prophetical Dream, was either a true Prophet indeed, or elſe a lying En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt, or falſe Prophet (ſuch as were the Idol Prieſts of the Heathen) to ſeduce the people, as is ſhewed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures before mentioned in this ſecond deſcription, and alſo in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 23.16.25.</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome may queſtion whether Dreams are now ſent by God to forewarn, as in ancient times, ſo long as we have no Scripture to the contrary (but rather for it) wee may not deny it; and do alſo finde by common experience that ſome have dreamed of their Childe falling into the fire, and ſome into the water, and of other ſeveral dangers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themſelves, and others, of which ſome have come to paſs that might have been prevented, by prayer and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

care. I know a man that was fore-warned in a Dream of theſe Wars in <hi>England</hi> before they began, (or were like to bee) but Prophetical Dreams are not uſual in theſe days.</p>
               <p>Yet here it may further be noted, that in ſome caſe a man may alſo declare a Prophetical Dream, and yet be neither a true Propher, nor a Witch, or falſe Prophet; and that hath ſometimes been ſeen by experience in ſuch as have been troubled in their phantaſies through diſtemper of body, or other diſtracting occaſions hurting their phantaſie, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that God hath ſpoken to them by Dream, or Viſion, or Voyce heard, or by an Angel, and hath bidden them go Propheſie ſuch and ſuch things, and theſe are to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably judged of, and not raſhly cenſured; this diſtemper of body may be diſcerned by the effects, that is, Death, or Sickneſs following within a ſhort time after, if not prevented by the Phiſitians; alſo troubled phanſie by outward diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be diſcerned by the fore-going occaſions that have troubled them, and hurt their phanſies; and here is required great diſcretion in all that ſhall ſee, or hear a Man or Woman declare a Meſſage from God (as he thinketh) for the intent of a falſe Prophet is only to deceive, or ſeduce for advantage of gain or preferment; ſome have written con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Dreams, that ſome Dreams are Diabolical, which are only Philoſophical Notions, having no grounds in the Scripture. And whereas it is manifeſt in the Scriptures that God ſpeaketh to men by Dreams, and interpretations of Dreams are only by the Spirit of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 40.8 I think it preſumption and Phantaſie, to adde any ſuch diſtinction of Dreams, except Enthuſiaſmes, which although they are of the Devil, yet are no real Dreams, but Lyes, for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts did falſly pretend that they had Dreamed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.25.27.32.</p>
               <p>Natural Dreams I deny not, which come from the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of buſineſs, and from the natural diſpoſition of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but none of theſe are any way concerning future events, but are only the objects of our Natural affections, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome of theſe are laſcivious Dreams, ſome Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65492:14"/>
ſome Covetous, and in that ſence may be called Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical; yet in theſe Dreams are nothing beſides Nature, neither hath the Devil any further act in them than in our corrupt ſtragling affections in the day time; and though our thoughts are ſometimes worſe in the night than in the day, it is becauſe our affections are buſied in the day with other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects preventing ſuch thoughts.</p>

To this it is anſwered, That under the colour of Aſtrologie theſe Planetarians that are here forbidden did harbour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that becauſe there was ſomewhat in that Science for the knowledge of ſome future things, therefore in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their knowledge in that Science they did take upon them to compare themſelves with the Prophets, and to draw the people after their uncertain Predictions, as if they had been equal with the Prophets, and many of them having no knowledge at all in that Science, yet did under the colour thereof harbour their deceitful Oracles, or Divinations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a Deity to the Planets, calling them gods, as <hi>Mars</hi> the god of Warre, <hi>Venus</hi> the goddeſs of Beauty, &amp;c. and did alſo aſcribe ſo much to their influence, as they beleeved no power above them, and ſo drew the people a whoring after them, to make them forget God the Author of all things, and to Deifie the Creature; and theſe Planetarians being meer Naturaliſts, and beleeving no power above the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, would bear a breaſt againſt the Prophets, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to do thoſe things that were only proper to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to do, and could be done by no other power but by the Spirit of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. they would undertake the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Dreams, if the dreams were related to them, nevertheleſs the expounding of dreams is of God only, verſ. 27, 28. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.16. and 40.8.

as Sunday from the Sun, Monday from the Moon, &amp;c. and in other Tongues is more manifeſt for every day; which if it be true that the Planets have their ſeveral influences upon the ſeveral days of the Week, yet their wickedneſs was in denying God that made the Heavens, and their Hoſt, and in deifying the Creature; and for this they are deſcribed among Witches, or ſeducers of the people to Idolatry, and this Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry God warneth his people to avoyd, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.19 <hi>Take heed when thou lifteſt up thine eyes to Heaven, and ſeeſt the Sun, and the Moon, and Stars, with all the Hoſt of Heaven, ſhouldeſt be driven to worſhip them and ſerve them, which the Lord thy God hath diſtributed to all people under heaven.</hi> Although God had given and diſtributed their influence to all people under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet men may not worſhip them, but worſhip God that made them.

               <p>Aſtrologians have alſo annexed to their Science of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, Palmiſtrie, and Phyſiognomie, the Caeleſtial Bodies, as they ſay, having fixed their Characters upon the inferiour Bodies of men (as he that readeth their Books may ſee, with the reaſon thereof) and therefore theſe Arts together with Aſtrologie do ſerve them to make their Prognoſticks concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſtrength, health, diſpoſition, and ſeveral events of any mans life; which Prognoſticks do often happen true, becauſe Natures courſe may be probably conjectured by the courſe and character of the Planets (although theſe Arts are much abuſed by wandring Gypſies, who under colour of ſuch knowledge, do commonly cheat ſilly people, and alſo rob their pockets, when they are viewing their hands and face to tell them their Fortunes;) now herein was one diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Planetarians, or Aſtrologians, lawful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in the Scripture ſence, the lawful Aſtrologian fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling probable events, fore-ſeen by Natural cauſes upon any perſon, or Nation; as <hi>Deborah</hi> obſerved the Stars concerning <hi>Sicera</hi> and his Army (although ſhe knew what ſhould come to paſs more certainly by the Spirit of Propheſie than by the Stars.) The unlawful Aſtrologian, or Planetarian fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling things not only probably, but certain and neceſſarily to come to paſs, as if there were ſuch ſtrong inclination, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and co-action in thoſe Coeleſtial Bodies, as that our earthly bodies can no way avoyd them, and as if God hath no Decree but what may be fore-ſeen in the Stars. But the Scripture, and true Religion teacheth us otherwiſe, for as a man may not be ſo ſtupid as to deny the influence of the Stars, ſo no man may be ſo Atheiſtical as to deny that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence ruleth all inferiour bodies; not only in that ſenſe, that <hi>Aſtra regunt homines &amp; regit aſtra Deus,</hi> (which is the Aſtrologians Creed) but beyond the influence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65492:16"/>
of the Stars; otherwiſe it were in vain to pray to God for recovery from ſickneſs, or loſs, or calamity, becauſe haply the Stars threaten death, or ruine; in vain it were then for the Elders of the Church to pray over the ſick, with hope of their recovery, except the Stars ſay, Amen. In vain it were then for a Nation to faſt, and pray for Peace when the Stars threaten War. In vain it were for a man to hope for proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in all his undertakings, by walking in Gods way (as is taught in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.9.) becauſe the Stars in that mans Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity threaten evil, and no proſperity to the whole courſe of that mans life. But as a skilful Phyſitian may by good Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical applications of remedies lengthen the days of a man, upon whom the Stars have a bad influence, and threaten death (which Aſtrologians themſelves confeſs) how much more may true Religion in a man obtain a bleſſing for health, and proſperity, and peace, beyond what the Stars do promiſe? which is the whole diſcourſe of <hi>Levit.</hi> chap. 26. therefore it muſt needs follow that Grace may turn away the bad influence, and Vice may hinder the good influence of the Stars from a Man, or a Nation; and they that were ſuch meer Naturaliſts, as that under colour of their ſcience in Aſtrologie they taught the people otherwiſe, they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Witches; and they that did ſeek to ſuch for Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and did not regard Divine Providence to rule beyond the Stars influence, and ſo neglected ſeeking to God in time of trouble, they were Idolaters bewitched.</p>
               <p>Another way might Aſtrologians become Witches, that is, if an Aſtrologian finding that many of his Prognoſticks happened true, and did thereby diſſemble Propheſie, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that he did by Revelation, or prophetical Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fore-tell thoſe things which yet he did only conjecturally foreſee by the Stars, that pretence or diſſimulation made him a Witch, fit to ſeduce and miſ-lead the people.</p>

               <p>THe Fourth deſcription, or term of deſcription, of a Witch in the text is <hi>Conjector,</hi> a Conjecturer; that was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65492:17"/>
ſuch a one that had ſome particular pretence or colour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he grounded his Divinations, making the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that thereby he could Divine or Propheſie unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; whereas yet it was altogether a couſening impoſture, or uncertain gueſſing, or conjecturing, and according to that he is here deſcribed by <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Witch; what that Impoſture was, Expoſitors have given ſeveral gloſſes, one Expoſition is, That they obſerved the flying of Fowls, and thence gave their uncertain Predictions, or Divinations, but for that we finde no example in the Scriptures in the Original ſence, and therefore leave it, and do alſo think, that to obſerve the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fowls for Predictions of weather, as alſo the poſtures of Beaſts, and creeping things is no offence, nor is here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. Another expoſition is, That they obſerved the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralls of Beaſts, from whence they pretended they did know the will of the gods; and that was indeed of Beaſts that were offered in Sacrifice to their Idols. By which pretence being but a meer couſening Impoſture, they ſeduced the people to Idolatry, and therefore were reckoned and deſcribed among Witches in the text; and for that expoſition we have that example in the Scriptures, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.26. (which in <hi>Tremel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> tranſlation is thus) To uſe Divinations, he will furbuſh Knives, he will conſult with Idols, he will look in the Liver, this is a plain demonſtration of this Fourth deſcription of a Witch in the text; that is, ſuch a one as pretended to the people that their Idol gods hiding their ſecrets in the intralls of the ſacrificed Beaſts, he being one of their Prieſts, could by ſearching the intralls, conjecture to the people the meaning of the gods. This expoſition is agreeable to that, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.3. when <hi>Manaſſes</hi> had built Idol-Altars in the Houſe of God, it followeth immediatly in the ſixt verſe, <hi>Et Divinationibus, &amp; conjectationibus &amp; preſtigiis uſus eſt;</hi> and he uſed Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Conjecturings, and Juglings, all tending to one end, to ſeduce the people to Idolatry, as followeth in the ninth verſe, he made <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to go aſtray, for God had appointed his people not to inquire after uncertain conjecturings, by any Idol Impoſtures of the Heathen, but to inquire after himſelf, by the Prophets, and by his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65492:17"/>
Prieſts, by an Ephod, by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> as appeareth, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.7. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.30.</p>
               <p>Some report that the <hi>Roman</hi> South-ſayers did take the anckle bone of a Beaſt ſacrificed, which bone was by them called <hi>talus</hi> in the Latine, the ſaid bone is eaſie to be ſeen in the foot of any Oxe or Sheep, and hath four ſides equally poyſed, and being caſt upon a Table it falleth contingently like a Dye; and therefore are the Dyes called by the ſame name in latin <hi>tali,</hi> and when thoſe Idol Prieſts, the <hi>Roman</hi> South-ſayers, would enquire of their Idols for Divinations, or rather give Divinations in the name of their Idols, they would caſt that bone upon the Table, and according to the ſeveral contingent falling of the bone like the caſt of a Dye, ſo they gave ſeveral conjecturing Divinations, every ſide when it chanced upward being of a ſeveral ſignification, given by their Idol, as they pretended; a meer cheating Impoſture to ſeduce the people; a lively demonſtration of it may be ſeen among Boys, caſting the bone in the ſame manner in certain childiſh Games called cock-up-all.</p>
               <p>It may be collected alſo, That the Idol Prieſts of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then did ſometimes uſe this impoſture for one, (they having divers ways to delude the people), that was, for the Prieſt to be blinde-folded, and one or more to touch him, and he to conjecture or gueſs who it was that touched him; which was eaſily done by the confederacy of ſome ſtander by, ſome Prieſt like himſelf, who gave him a private token which the people did not take notice of, but were thereby deluded, and thought him to have a Prophetical inſpiration from the Idol gods, and this is collected from <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.68. eſpecially if that place be compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 14.65. where it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That the corrupt <hi>Jews,</hi> who had been defiled by the manner of the Heathen, did blind-fold Chriſt and ſmite him, and ſaid, <hi>Propheſie, who it is that ſmote thee;</hi> they offering to try Chriſt by ſuch ways as they had ſeen the Heathen try their Prophets by, who notwithſtanding were Impoſtors and falſe Prophets.</p>

               <p>THe interpretation of this word is plain in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that is, one that worketh falſe or lying Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or lying Miracles, in oppoſition of the true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that were wrought by God, by his Prophets, ſuch were <hi>Jannes,</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.8, 9. <hi>As</hi> Jannes <hi>and</hi> Jambres <hi>withſtood</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſo alſo do theſe reſiſt the truth;</hi> now how <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withſtood <hi>Moſes</hi> it appeareth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.5.8.9.

And as it appeareth in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. their actions were only mad fooleries that came to light, and were proved ridiculous, as the words import, for the craft of Jugling, to them that are not acquainted with it, breedeth great admiration in the beholders, and ſeemeth, to ſilly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be miraculous, and yet being known is but deceit and

               <p>The firſt is profitably ſeen in our common Juglers, that go up and down to play their Tricks in Fayrs and Markets, I will ſpeak of one man more excelling in that craft than others, that went about in King <hi>James</hi> his time, and long ſince, who called himſelf, <hi>The Kings Majeſties moſt excellent Hocus Pocus,</hi> and ſo was he called, becauſe that at the playing of every Trick, he uſed to ſay, <hi>Hocus pocus, tontus talontus, vade celeriter jubeo,</hi> a dark compoſure of words, to blinde the eyes of the beholders, to make his Trick paſs the more currantly without diſcovery, becauſe when the eye and the ear of the beholder are both earneſtly buſied, the Trick is not ſo eaſily diſcovered, nor the Impoſture diſcerned; the going about of this Fellow was very uſeful to the wife, to ſee how eaſily peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple among the ancient Heathen were deceived, in times and places of ignorance, for in theſe times many ſilly people (yea and ſome alſo that think themſelves wiſe) will ſtand like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Servants, and admire a Jugling Impoſture; or like the ſilly <hi>Samaritans,</hi> Acts 8.10. who did ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire a ſeducing Jugler, as they ſaid, He was the great power of God, until they ſaw the true and real Miracles of <hi>Philip,</hi> verſ. 6. And others again on the contrary will ſtand affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or run out of the room ſcared like fools, ſaying, The Devil is in the room, and helpeth him to do ſuch Tricks; and ſome ſaying abſolutely.

at large, to the ſatisfaction of all thoſe that are not wilfully ignorant; as alſo briefly afterward in this Fifth deſcription, after pag. 34. And now for illuſtrating of the Hiſtory of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians, I will parallel this <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> or Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Jugler, a little with them; they are called <hi>Preſtigiatores,</hi> Juglers, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.14. and yet in the ſame verſe, and alſo in verſ. 25. it is ſaid, they did in like manner by their inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Why with their Inchantments? Not that Jugling and Inchanting are one and the ſame impoſture, but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe when they wrought a Jugling Trick, or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracle, they always ſpake a Charm, or Inchantation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before it, like to that of our Engliſh Jugler afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, to make the deluſion the ſtronger, by buſying the ſenſes of Hearing and Seeing in the Spectator both at once, for a Charm, or Inchantation was only a compoſure of words to delude people, who thought that words ſpoken in a ſtrange manner had vertue and efficacy in them (as may be ſeen more fully in the Sixth deſcription following) therefore are they ſaid to work their falſe Miracles by their Inchantments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeemed to ſilly beholders to do them by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantations or words, when as indeed they did them only by ſlight of hand, or cleanly conveyance called <hi>Legerdemain;</hi> and they that are well acquainted with this craft of Jugling, may eaſily conceive how theſe Magicians did their Feats without ſo much admiring them, when they read the Hiſtory, as if they had done great Wonders, which were only deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; The ſecond and third Miracle, that they diſſembled, do plainly appear in the letter of the Hiſtory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.2. they ſeemed to turn water into bloud, <hi>Fecerunt ſimiliter,</hi> and yet mark well the Hiſtory, and yee ſhall ſee there was no water in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for <hi>Moſes</hi> had turned it all into bloud before, verſ. 20.21.24.25. ſo then they could finde no River or Pond to do that feat in, it muſt needs follow then, that they ſent for water where it was to be had, which was no nearer than <hi>Goſhen,</hi> and ſo ſhewed a petty Jugling Trick before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in a room, with a Bowl or Tray of water, ſetting it upon the ground, and by ſlight of hand conveying bloud into it to colour it; ſo likewiſe for the Third Miracle which they
<pb facs="tcp:65492:19"/>
diſſembled, Chap. 8.7. it was neceſſarily done by a ſuch veſſel of water; for they could not finde any other water free in all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which were not already full of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Frogs, verſ. 3.5. and what common Jugler might not eaſily diſſemble that Miracle, by ſetting a bowl of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter down before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Servants, and by ſlight of hand conveying in three or four Frogs, and ſo holding up their ſtaffe, and ſpeaking certain words to make it ſeem to ſilly ſpectators that the waters brought forth thoſe Frogs; The firſt Miracle indeed ſeemeth more difficult to diſſemble, and yet not ſo difficult if you ſaw it acted, for what is eaſier than for a cunning Jugler to hold up a ſtaffe as if he would throw it down, and then to ſpeak a lofty inchantation, to buſie the intention of the Spectators, and then with ſlight of hand to throw down an artificial Serpent inſtead of his ſtaffe, and convey away his ſtaffe, that ſo they might think his ſtaffe was turned into a Serpent, for theſe Hiſtories are ſet down according to the apprehenſion of the deceived behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not that the Magicians did them really, for then we muſt beleeve that they wrought real Miracles as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did, which were an ignorant and abſurd tenent; whereas the Scriptures do manifeſt that they were only mad fooleries, and were diſcovered and came to light, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. yet many are ſo ſtupid, that rather then they will not have them really done, they ſay they were really done by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Devil, and ſo aſcribe power to the Devil for work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles, whereas we never read in the Scriptures that the Devil may have any ſupernatural power aſcribed to him, but is only the Father of Lyes.</p>
               <p>The ſame kinde of Jugling Tricks were the Impoſtures of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.9. which although the people did for a time behold with admiration, yet when they ſaw real Miracles wrought by <hi>Philip,</hi> verſ. 6.12. they beleeved him, and not the Impoſtor any longer, for they did eaſily ſee a difference between real Miracles, and cheating Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures.</p>
               <p>Some again will have it, that theſe Acts of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and others in the Scriptures might be real as they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65492:20"/>
to be, and yet brought to paſs by the profoundneſs of the Art of <hi>Magick,</hi> which Art is of greater force (ſay they) than Jugling, or elſe why were they called in the ſame verſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.11. Juglers, Wiſe men, and Magicians all at once? but let not any be ſo weak in underſtanding as to think, That any Art in the World could do that really that required a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous hand of power to do, for this is the eſſential or formal reaſon of a Miracle to be done by a power Supream, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of Man or Devil, or the vertue of any Art; and for this word, <hi>Magicians,</hi> in its own proper ſence it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for Wiſe and Learned men, in <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> and other Arts wherein Schollers are inſtituted; and ſo there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>I ſaid a little before, That this craft of Jugling conſiſteth of three things; the Firſt is, Slight of Hand, or cleanly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance; the Second is Confederacy, that is, when many or
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65492:20"/>
few agents do agree together in bringing to paſs cheating impoſtures, contrary to the truth. An example of this wee have in the Hiſtory of <hi>Bell,</hi> the Idol, in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which though it be called <hi>Apocripha,</hi> and doubtful whether it be a true Hiſtory, yet this example whether it bee true or not, it doth plainly demonſtrate the Witchcraft of Idol Prieſts by confederacy, which is one main arm of the craft of Jugling, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 14.14.20. it appeareth plain how they confederated together in extolling the Idol, to uphold it for their own delicious maintenance, and to ſeduce the King and people to Idolatry, by making them beleeve that <hi>Bell</hi> did eate up all the daily proviſion that was ſet before him, whereas they themſelves, with their Wives and Children, came in at ſecret doors in the night, and did eate up and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away all that was provided at the Kings charge, until <hi>Daniel</hi> diſcovered that their jugling impoſture; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be not ſo plain a demonſtration of the Jugling Impoſtures of every Idol ſpoken of in the Scriptures, yet no Idol but had the like deluſions; for they built their Idol Houſes on purpoſe with ſeveral ſlights, and ſecret conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to bring their Jugling Tricks to paſs, and had daily new inventions of new Impoſtures whereby they deceived the World, and ſeduced them to Idolatry, therefore <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.19. would not truſt the Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> to remain in their own Idol Houſe, when he would diſcover them to the people, but cauſed them all to come forth to Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> and then he ſaid, as in verſ. 24. <hi>The God that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth by fire, let him be God.</hi> Why did he cauſe the King to command them all to Mount <hi>Carmel?</hi> The reaſon was, becauſe if they might have acted their part in their Idol Houſe, being built with ſecret conveyances for all deceit, they might have ſecretly fired the Oblation, and ſo might have deluded the people, ſtill making them beleeve their Idol had anſwered them by fire, but being in Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from their Idol Houſe, they could only act the part of Mad-men, cutting themſelves that the people might have ſomewhat to gaze at, but could bring nothing to paſs to ſave their credit, or their lives; the deluding impoſtures of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65492:21"/>
the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> are called <hi>Praeſtigiae Iſabelae,</hi> 2 King. 9.22 the Juglings or Witchcraft of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> becauſe ſhe being an Idolatrous Woman maintained thoſe Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> in their Witchcraft, or deluſions, to ſeduce the people to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
               <p>The third Branch whereupon this craft of Jugling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, is the abuſe of Natural Magick, that is, the abuſe of their knowledge in Natural cauſes, as for inſtance in ſome few; take Woolfs dung, and carry it in your pocket that it may take the heat of your body, and it will make any mad Bull, or other Cattel of that kinde to fly from you, and to run very farre away from their paſture to the admiration of the beholders. Take a peece of paper and rub one part of it with freſh Lemmon peele, and dry it again a little, and then dip your Pen in Inke, that is made of ſtone blew, ſteeped two or three days in cold water, and write upon the place that had the tincture of the Lemmon peele, and it will write a pure bright red, and then with the ſame Pen and Inke write upon another place of the paper, and it writeth blew, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by there is cauſed great admiration in the beholders, to ſee a man with one Pen, and one and the ſame Inke write red and blew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Albartus Magnus,</hi> and alſo <hi>Miſaldus</hi> do write of many wonderful things that may be done by the knowledge of Natural cauſes, or the ſecrets of Nature, which although many of them be falſe, yet for ſuch as are true, they may bee lawfully done; and therein we may glorifie God, in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the wonderful Works of his hands, in the ſecret cauſes of things.</p>
               <p>But now for the abuſe of theſe things, as namely by the doing of theſe things to ſeduce the people, by making ſilly people beleeve we do them by a miraculous power, thereby pretending our ſelves to be Prophets, as did <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in the <hi>Acts;</hi> this is right Jugling Witchcraft, or to make the people beleeve that they are done by the power of ſome Idol, thereby to ſeduce the people, or any way to affront the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, by comparing them with true Miracles, to withſtand the truth, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians did, were right Witchcraft.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:65492:21"/>So likewiſe for the Oyntment called <hi>Unguentum armaxis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or Weapon ſalve (that is an Oyntment made of ſuch ingredients, as by anointing the Weapon wherewith a man or beaſt is wounded, it healeth the Wound (if it be true by certain experience, as many Phiſitians and Chyrurgions do affirm) it may lawfully be uſed, and we may glorifie God in the uſe of it, who hath given ſuch excellent ſecret qualities to the Creatures, which are made for the uſe of man.</p>
               <p>Alſo <hi>Jacob</hi> uſed the peeled rods, which by their ſecret o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration being ſet before the ſheep in the heat of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, cauſed them, by beholding them in their conceiving, to conceive and bring forth party coloured Lambs; but if any man ſhall uſe theſe ſecrets to this end to make the people beleeve they are Prophets, and do them by a miraculous power, that ſo they may ſeduce the people to errour under a colour of working Miracles, ſuch men are ſeducing Witches.</p>
               <p>Thus a Planetarian abuſing the lawful Science of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie may become a Witch, not only under the notion of 2 Planetarian, but of a Jugler; as for inſtance, <hi>Pedro Mexi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another way it is very craftily done by a <hi>Spaniſh Borachio,</hi> that is a Leather Bottle as thin and little as a Glove, the neck whereof is about a foot long, with a ſcrew at the top inſtead of a ſtopple; this Bottle the Jugler holdeth under his arm, and letteth the neck of it come along to his hand under the ſleeve of his Coat, and with the ſame hand taketh the tax in the faſſet that is in the poſt, and yet holdeth the tax half in and half out, and cruſheth the Bottle with his arm, and with his other band holdeth a Wine-pot to the tax, ſo that it ſeemeth to the beholders that the Wine cometh out of the tax, which yet cometh out of the Bottle, and then he giveth it among the company to drink; and being all drunk up but one ſmall glaſs at the laſt, he calleth to his Boy, ſaying, Come ſirrah, you would faine have a cup, but his Boy make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth anſwer in a diſdainful manner, ſaying, No Maſter not I, if that be good Wine that is drawn out of a Poſt I will loſe my head; yea ſirrah ſaith his Maſter, then your head you ſhall loſe; come ſirrah, you ſhall go to pot for that word; then he layeth his Boy down upon the Table upon a Carpet, with his face downward commanding him to lye ſtill, then he taketh a linnen cloth, and ſpreadeth it upon the Boys head broad upon the table, and by ſlight of hand conveyeth under the cloth a Head with a face, limned ſo like his Boys Head and Face that it is not diſcerned from it; then hee draweth

(unleſs they do them to ſeduce, and then the Devil is indeed in their heart, as he was in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and is in every wicked man.) And yet ſometimes it hapneth, that if here have been any Univerſity Schollars at the beholding, or at the acting of theſe common Tricks, they have gone out and fallen into a diſpute upon the matter, ſome ſaying, <hi>Senſus nunquam fallitur circa proprium objectum,</hi> ſome have ſaid that the Jugler by his Familiar doth thicken the Air, ſome again that he hurteth the Eye-ſight, and ſo deceiveth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders; and in all their diſcourſe they ſhew themſelves very <hi>Philoſophical,</hi> but very little <hi>capacious.</hi> And <hi>Cooper</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon that ſubject, hath pretended to ſhew himſelf <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical,</hi> but betrayeth himſelf to be very ſilly, blinde, and ignorant.</p>
               <p>It being fully demonſtrated what a Jugler is in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſence, let every one conſider ſeriouſly who be the Juglers, of this and former Ages, that ought to be put to death by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we might think that no man were ſo ſilly and fooliſh to think that it is meant common Juglers, who play their Tricks in Fayers and Markets, nor Gentlemen who ſometimes in imitation of them, do in ſport, play Tricks of ſlight of hand, or legerdemain, with confederates or without, for it is moſt certain and true, that if it bee rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that theſe do a great deal of good, that recreation ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rightly to the illumination of people of all ſorts, to ſhew them the vanity and ridiculouſneſs of thoſe deluſions and lying Wonders, by which men were ſo eaſily deluded in old times by <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians, by <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> the Sorcerer, and now adays by our profeſſed Wizzards, or Witches, commonly called Cunning Men, or good Witches, who will undertake to ſhew the face of the Thief in the Glaſs, or of any other that hath done his Neighbour wrong privily, when as they do all by Jugling deluſions, and are themſelves right Witches, that cauſe men to ſeek to the Devil for help, that will undertake and promiſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch people that are (as fools commonly ſay) bewitched; theſe common ſporting Juglers alſo may illuminate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſee the Jugling Witchcraft of Popiſh Prieſts, in cauſing

               <p>Yet in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, as appeareth in Mr. <hi>Scots</hi> Diſcovery of Witchcraft, in the fifteenth Book, Chap. 42. there was a Maſter of Arts condemned only for uſing himſelf to the ſtudy and practiſe of the Jugling craft, how juſtly, I will not controvert; but this I ſay, That if a man may not ſtudy and practiſe the diſcovery of Chears without being a Cheater, nor the diſcovery of Witchcraft without being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Witch, it is the way for Witches and Cheaters to play their pranks, and no man able to tax them, or accuſe them, or to ſay who they are that are Witches; and this fooliſh nice cenſuring, and ignorant condemning hath bred great and general ignorance of this ſubject of Witchcraft; which God himſelf deſcribeth ſo often in the Scriptures, for people to know and avoyd the practiſe of ſeducing, or being ſeduced by it, but for that Maſter of Arts before named, the Lord of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> having more wiſdom in ſome things than ſome had, did protect him for a time after he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but what became of him is not mentioned, but yet if he had been a Jugler, or practiſer of that Craft to this end, to withſtand the Prophets when they wrought true Miracles, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Juglers withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> or if he were one that practiſed it to ſeduce the people after lying deluſions, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie himſelf as a falſe Prophet, like <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> or to cauſe people to aſcribe miraculous power to him, or to ſeek to the Devil as our common Deceivers, called good Witches, do, he was deſervedly condemned; but to ſtudy Witchcraft, and actually to demonſtrate it by practiſe, to ſhew how eaſily people were and may be deluded by it (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God hath commanded Witches to be put to death, and what they were or are, is not now a days fully underſtood (no not by the Learned) is no more deſerving death than for Maſter <hi>Scot</hi> to write a book in the diſcovery of it, or for a Miniſter to diſcover to the people the danger of an Idol; to which Witchcraft is neceſſarily joyned as an upholder and companion, or for a Miniſter to ſhew the ſecret and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

nature, and ſeveral windings of Sin and Satan; for the eſſence of a Witch is not in doing falſe Miracles, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Witchcraft by demonſtration or diſcovery, but in ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing people from God, and his Truth; As for example, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> Magicians in that they did throw down their ſtafle, and made it ſeeme to be turned into a Serpent, to the end to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to ſeduce the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> they were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Witches, but if any man now do the very ſame, or had then done it to diſcover the Jugling deceit of it, hee is no Witch, but a teacher and inſtructer of the people.</p>
               <p>So again for another example, he that goeth behinde a <hi>Rhood,</hi> or other Popiſh Image, and draweth the ſecret Wiers that cauſeth the eyes and hands of the Image to move, to the end to delude and ſeduce the people to Idolatry, by admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, as Popiſh Prieſts do; he is an abſolute Witch, but he that goes behind it, and acteth the ſame part, and then cometh out and ſheweth people the Impoſture, and ſheweth them the Wyers and ſecret deluſions, is not a Witch, but a diſcoverer of a Witch (that did it to the end to ſeduce) and a Teacher and illuminator of the people. See more in the Sixth deſcription.</p>
               <p>But we muſt know that in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion being then in its minority, when as Popery was but only ſuppreſſed, and not worn out of the memory, nor out of the hearts and affections of men (that yet in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew were Proteſtants) it was a brief tenent in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities, that he that did but ſtudy and contemplate upon this ſubject of Witchcraft was a dealer with unlawful and vain Science, and ought to be cenſured for a Witch, and by this ſubtill tradition they feared all Students, that no man dared to ſearch into the bowels and ſecrets of that Craft, leaſt (as they knew full well) thereby he ſhould diſcover to the World the ſecret Impoſtures of the Popiſh Religion, which is altogether upheld by Witchcraft, of which Religion, many ſtood daily in expectation to have it ſet on foot as brief as ever, when (as they hoped) the times would change. Hath God given nine ſeveral deſcriptions of Witchcraft at once? <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11. and reiterated them in many places of Scripture
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65492:25"/>
that we might take notice, who and what they are, with the Myſtery of iniquity, and deluſions that they practiſed? and ſhall not we ſtudy and contemplate upon it? by this vain tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were many of their devilliſh Witchcrafts concealed, and came not to light, for many years, to the view of the world; example of that Popiſh Idol, <hi>Cheapſide Croſſe,</hi> which ſtood for many years like the Golden Image of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> few men knowing the jugling Witchcraft that was therein, untill at the command of the Parliament it being pulled down, there were found therein the ſeverall ſlights to move the Arms, Eyes, and Heads of the Images, and the Pipes to convey the water to make the Images ſhed tears in compaſſion to the peoples prayers, and to convey Milk into the breaſts of the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that the poor deluded people (ſeeing ſuch lying Wonders, as Images of Gold, to move, to weep, and ſhed tears in abundance, and Milk to drop out of the Virgins breaſts, through her earneſt labouring with her Son to hear, and grant the prayers of the people) went home, bewitched to that devilliſh Idolatry by that grand Witch, that Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> that hath deceived all Nations with her Witchcraft, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.23. yet, to the grief of the hearts of this Popiſh crew, in the beginning of the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> many of their devilliſh Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts were daily diſcovered, as in Maſter <hi>Lumberts</hi> Book of the Perambulation of <hi>Kent</hi> it appeareth, was diſcovered the <hi>Rhood</hi> of grace in <hi>Kent,</hi> who was always accompanied and helped by little St. <hi>Rumball,</hi> which Idol as Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> noteth in <hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. was not inferiour in all deluding Impoſtures to the great Idol <hi>Apollo</hi> (or <hi>Apollos</hi> Oracle) whoſe Prieſts were the grand Witches of the World in its time) yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the wires that made the eyes of the Images to goggle, and the Pins and Inſtruments for ſeveral deluſions were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, with all the Witchcraft of the jugling Prieſts, with every circumſtance thereof, which Image and Inſtruments were openly burnt together, by the authority and command of the Queen.</p>
               <p>And now it falleth in my way to ſpeak of another grand Witch of the World, that is, <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the great Idol of

That <hi>Gabriel</hi> did uſe to appear to all Prophets, and ſo both of them together did perſwade the ſilly Woman that the reaſon of his falling in a Trance was, becauſe the Angel was ſo glorious that he was not able to behold him without falling, and that all the time of his lying thus proſtrate the Angel was talking with him; this ſilly Woman rejoycing in this, That ſhe was married to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, reported the thing among other Women, ſo that in time this fellow obtained among pratling Women, and common people, the name of a Prophet; the Devil by this fellow taking occaſion, and waiting his opportunity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the World (as alſo by <hi>Sergius</hi> the Monck who was his companion) it hapned about the year of our Lord Chriſt, 591. about which time alſo began the Antichriſtian Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at <hi>Rome</hi>) that <hi>Heraclius</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſe of the Armies of the <hi>Sarazens</hi> againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> (and not giving them their daily pay or ſtipend, which they expected and required of his Captains over them) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65492:27"/>
greedy of fighting, be their danger never ſo great. Much more is reported of this Impoſtor by ſeveral Hiſtorians, but I have only deſcribed him briefly by theſe his ſeducements, (although he had many more) wherein may be noted that he was a Jugling falſe Prophet, in faining himſelf to be in <hi>extaſie</hi> of minde, in a miraculous manner talking with the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> (according to this fifth term of deſcription in the text) whereas he was only viſited with the fits of his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pileptick</hi> diſeaſe; and in that he pretended theſe abſurd Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies to be revealed to him by the Angel, he was a Diviner, and a lying <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> (according to the ſecond term of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in the text) in both which ſenſe <hi>Sergius</hi> the Monck, and the reſt of his Companions aforeſaid, who joyned with him in his deluſions, were Witches alſo; and herein it is ſtrange to ſee the world of people that are infatuated by ſo groundleſs a Religion, for were it not for the ſtupidity of mens mindes and underſtanding, God did enough diſcover this <hi>Mahomet</hi> (the founder of this <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion) to bee an Impoſtor) at his death, for when hee boaſted himſelf that at his death he would riſe again the third day as Chriſt did, <hi>Albunar,</hi> one of his Diſciples, to try the truth of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins and vaticiniations, gave him a cup of deadly poyſon, which being drunk he ſwelled and dyed, and ſome hoping to ſee his Reſurrection let him lye twelve days above ground, untill he ſtunk ſo intollerably that all men left him; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the twelfth day <hi>Albunar</hi> coming to view his Corps found his bones almoſt bare, his fleſh being eaten with Doggs; wherefore he gathered his bones together and buried them in a pot, yet for the eſtabliſhing of the Empire, to his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, they maintain ſtill his Religion, and have made him an Iron Sepulchre at <hi>Mecha.</hi>

               <p>THe Sixth deſcription of a Witch in the Text, is, <hi>Incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> or <hi>Utens incantatione,</hi> that is, an Inchanter, or uſer of Charms, or a Charmer.</p>
               <p>A Charm (as is ſaid before in the Fifth deſcription) is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſtrange compoſure of words to blinde the underſtandings of people, it pretending that by vertue of words great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were brought to paſs, and theſe Charms were uſed either before a Jugling Trick, to buſie the mindes of the Spectators, to make the Trick paſs the more currently without being perceived, as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Juglers uſed them, who are ſaid to do that which they did with their Inchantments, becauſe they ſeemed to do things by vertue of words ſpoken, which were not done at all, but only diſſembled by the jugling craft; (which demonſtration of a Charm, or Incantation uſed in that kinde is alſo ſet down in the Fifth deſcription) or elſe otherwiſe theſe Charms were uſed or ſpoken alone without a Jugling ſlight, and thereby was pretended, that by vertue of ſuch and ſuch words ſpoken, ſuch things ſhould come to paſs as the party deſired, who inquired after Charmers for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of concernment; ſometimes theſe Charms were given in writing for a man to wear about his neck, or to carry in his pocket, pretending that by vertue of thoſe words his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould be brought to paſs, whereas words of themſelves either ſpoken, or written, have no force to bring any thing to paſs; neither was it the word <hi>Ephatha,</hi> Mark 7.34. that opened the ears of the deaf (as ſome inchanting Wizards would make people beleeve it was) but the power of him that ſpake it; yet ſuch was the manner of the Idol Prieſts, and falſe Prophets, that whereas Gods Prophets ſpake words in the name of the Lord, and the things they ſpake came to paſs by Gods power, thoſe Idol Prieſts and falſe Prophets pretended, that by vertue of words they could bring to paſs the like, and ſo they led the people a whoring after them, to regard more their fooliſh deluding Charms, than the power of God, that bringeth all things to paſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:65492:28"/>The <hi>Roman</hi> South-ſayers gave their Charms in verſe, from whence is derived the word <hi>Charm,</hi> from <hi>Carmen,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a Verſe, or a Charm; the manner of Charms ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times conſiſted in bleſſing and curſing, the Inchanter preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, That by vertue of a Charm he could bleſs, and that they were bleſſed that carried ſuch words about them writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a paper, or that had ſuch words ſpoken to them, or in their behalf by the Charms; and that by vertue of an Incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation pronounced againſt any man, that man was curſed, and that he that carried ſuch a Charm with him, his enemies were curſed, and ſhould fall before him. <hi>Eliſha</hi> indeed cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed two and forty Children in the name of the Lord, and they were accurſed, becauſe it was the wrath of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them by his Prophet, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.23. but hee that imputeth it to the vertue of a Curſe, and uſeth ſuch words as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſpake to bring ſuch a thing to paſs, againſt an enemy, without warrant from God, hee is an inchanting Witch; and he that truſteth to ſuch words meerly for the vertue of words, either of bleſſing or curſing, is an Idolater, not diſcerning the power of God, the Curſe without cauſe ſhall not come, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.33. neither ſhall bleſſing or curſing prevail any thing if it be not from the Lord; if <hi>Micaiah</hi> had Propheſied good to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as he would have had him, it had not availed, but it had been a meer Charm, that is, a meer compoſure of unwarranted words, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.13. and yet his falſe Prophets could pleaſe him well, making him beleeve that by vertue of their pretended Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie (which was but a meer Charm) all things ſhould go well with him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>A more plain demonſtration of this Diſcourſe is the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Balaam,</hi> Numb. 22.6. <hi>Balac</hi> ſent to <hi>Balaam</hi> to Curſe the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but he concludeth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.27. there is no inchanting againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for had <hi>Balaam</hi> played the inchanting Witch, as <hi>Balac</hi> would have had him, it had availed nothing, becauſe Charms are of no force, no more than Divinations, which are only given by deceiving Witches to cheat Idolatrous fools of their mony. And in Chap. 24. verſ. 1. it is ſaid, <hi>Balaam</hi> went not as formerly to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65492:28"/>
fetch Inchantments, or Incantations, that is, groundleſs and unwarranted Execrations, which are but Charms of no force, but only to delude the Hearers; for it is underſtood in the Chapter and Verſe aforeſaid, not that <hi>Balaam</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly gone to fetch Incantations, for it is ſaid in Chap 22. verſ. 19. and chap. 23.3, 4, 5. verſes, he went to inquire of the Lord; but here in Chap. 24.1. it is ſpoken according to the intention of <hi>Balak</hi> and his Princes, for they deſired that <hi>Balaam</hi> would but curſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whether he had warrant or not, ſuppoſing the words being but ſpoken by him were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, as is ſaid in Chap. 22. verſ. 6. and Chap 23. verſ. 11. which intention of theirs is here in Chap. 24. verſ. 1. called fetching of Incantations, for it implyeth the fooliſh ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Balak</hi> and his Princes, which they expreſſed in chap. 22. verſ. 6. That whomſoever <hi>Balaam</hi> curſed were accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and whom he bleſſed were bleſſed; for if a very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſhould ſo farre tranſgreſs, and go without warrant from God in bleſſing and curſing, or Prophecying, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet were no more a Prophet, but an inchanting deluding Witch, and his words would not be worth regarding; and this is a ſufficient demonſtration of a Charmer, or Inchanter, or uſer of Incantations, being the Sixth term of deſcription in the text, that is, that maketh any compoſure of words to delude the people, pretending to the people any vertue in words to bring things to paſs, and ſo cauſeth people not to diſcern the power of God that bringeth all things to paſs, but to impute things to the power of words, being but Charms, or Incantations. And indeed the fore-named Hiſtory of <hi>Balaam,</hi> if it be rightly obſerved, is a large and a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the vanity of this ſort of Witchcraft, whereby people were commonly ſeduced by falſe Prophets, or Witches, by liſtening only to the ſound of words, and not to God the only diſpoſer and bringer of all things to paſs; for it appeareth in the Hiſtory, that when <hi>Balak</hi> had cauſed <hi>Balaam</hi> to try all the ways that could be to curſe the people by Charms, and he could not (becauſe God gave him no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and he knew it was in vain to do it without warrant) yet <hi>Balaam</hi> tranſgreſſing the word and command of God,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65492:29"/>
ſhewed to <hi>Balak</hi> the only way to bring a Curſe upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> indeed, and that was by ſeducing them to Idolatry, and cauſing their God to bee angry with them, as appeareth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.14. where it is to be marked, That although in that verſe this counſel of <hi>Balaam</hi> to <hi>Balak</hi> is not ſet down at large, yet the effect thereof appeareth in the next Chapter, and alſo in <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.14. and <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ. 11. where we may ſee that <hi>Balaam</hi> for reward taught <hi>Balak</hi> to lay a ſtumbling-block before the people, to cauſe them to fall, that ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-block were the Idols of <hi>Moab,</hi> which they being defiled withall, brought down the frowns of God upon them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.3. but to hurt them with Charms or Incantations, was a vain and Idolatrous ſuperſtition of <hi>Balak,</hi> and if <hi>Balaam</hi> had anſwered his expectation, he had been indeed a Jugling Witch.</p>
               <p>The manner of <hi>Heathen</hi> Kings was, to ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Kingdom (as they thought in their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous credulity) by theſe Inchantments, ſuppoſing, that if their inchanting falſe Prophets, (which were alſo Planetari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and South-ſayers, and Jugling deluders) did but utter their Inchantments, (being pretended Prophecies, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings artificially compoſed) againſt their enemies, that then their enemies ſhould fall before them; and this is manifeſt in the Scriptures, not only of <hi>Balak,</hi> but of the King of <hi>Babel,</hi> and of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> Iſa. 47.12. Stand now with thy Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith thou haſt laboured from thy youth, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou maiſt profit, if perhaps thou ſhalt ſhew thy ſelf ſtrong. This alſo was <hi>Ahabs</hi> Idolatry, when he deſired <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah</hi> to Propheſie good unto him againſt <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> thinking by vertue of ungrounded Prophecie (which had been but a meer compoſed Charm) hee ſhould prevail, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.13.</p>
               <p>Here may ariſe a Queſtion, Whether every one that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his Neighbour be a Witch or not, according to this Sixth deſcription in the text?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That all bleſſing and curſing is not the formal eſſence of an Inchanter, for every one ought to bleſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.28. and he indeed that curſeth his Neighbour, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65492:29"/>
                  <hi>A Plague take him, or I would he might break his neck, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come home again,</hi> is a curſing railer, like <hi>Shime<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and a wicked breaker of Gods Law, for we ought to pray for our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but all this kinde of paſſionate curſing doth not make an Inchanter, or Witch, but that bleſſing or curſing that maketh an Inchanter or Witch, or is of the eſſence of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanter, is the profeſſed craft of compoſing bleſſings and curſings, whereby they drew the people a whoring after them, making them beleeve, that by vertue of Charms, whomſoever they bleſſed were bleſſed, and whom they cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed were accurſed, as <hi>Balak</hi> and his Princes being trained up in that kinde of Idolatry, thought, and ſaid of <hi>Balaam;</hi> and had <hi>Balaam</hi> anſwered them according to their expectations, he had been an Inchanter, or Witch, or falſe Prophet; this deſcription of a Charmer, as alſo all the nine terms of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a Witch in the text, being only deſcriptions of falſe Prophets that ſeduced the people; and whereas Gods Prophets bleſſed in the name of the Lord, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> bleſſed <hi>Jacob,</hi> or curſed, or pronounced a Curſe, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> againſt the forty and two Children, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.24. and in all this, and in all other Propheſyings they did nothing of themſelves, nor could any whit tranſgreſs the Word of the Lord; ſo on the contrary, falſe Prophets would give Divinations for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards without any warrant or command from God; as <hi>Balak</hi> ſuppoſing <hi>Balaam</hi> would doe, ſent the reward of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.7. (that is there to be taken) he ſent the reward of Inchantments, or Incantations; for Divinations againſt any man, that is unwarranted Propheſying againſt any man, is Inchantments (Divinations properly pretending Predictions, and manifeſtation of things hidden, being the Second deſcription) but to uſe any compoſure of Divining words, thereby to cauſe any thing to come to paſs, as <hi>Balak</hi> thought <hi>Balaam</hi> could do, and as <hi>Ahab</hi> thought <hi>Micaiah</hi> could doe, is Incantation, or Inchanting here.</p>
               <p>Here may ariſe another Queſtion, Whether was <hi>Balaam</hi> a Witch or not, as ſome have ſuppoſed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If he was a Witch, it muſt be according to ſome one term of deſcription in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11. but which of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65492:30"/>
theſe can we call him? Inchanter he was none, for he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do it, although he was offered a reward. Surely <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> was a Prophet of God, whom <hi>Balak</hi> thought could bring things to paſs by his own power, he not diſcerning the power of God. All that we read of him in uttering of his Parables was to this end, That <hi>Iſrael</hi> was bleſſed, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations or Curſing could not hurt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Hiſtory is a real Prophecie acted by <hi>Balaam</hi> by Gods appointment, concluding all in this one Doctrin, That the only way to bewitch <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was, to lay ſtumbling-blocks before them, to inſnare them with ſins, and to bring down Gods Judgements upon them, <hi>Numb:</hi> 24.14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.14. yet the calling of this a Prophecie ſeemeth to be contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Scriptures, for how could he be ſaid to be a Prophet of God, that taught <hi>Balak</hi> how to bring a curſe upon <hi>Iſrael?</hi> but if we mark well the Hiſtory, it may ſeem to ſome to be ful of contradictions, as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.12. God ſaid to <hi>Balaam, Go not,</hi> and verſ. 20. <hi>Riſe up and go with them;</hi> and verſ. 22. <hi>The wrath of God was kindled becauſe he went;</hi> and verſ. 34. <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaid, <hi>If it diſpleaſe thee, I will return home again;</hi> and verſ. 35. <hi>The Angel ſaid, Go with the men;</hi> what is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, <hi>go not,</hi> and yet <hi>go</hi> ſo often repeated? That is, go not according to the hire and requeſt of <hi>Balak</hi> to play the Inchanter, but go to do the work of a Prophet, to ſhew the vanity of <hi>Balak</hi> his thoughts, who thinketh that words can prevail either to Bleſs or to Curſe without warrant from God; and ſo <hi>Balaam</hi> as a Prophet obeyed the Lord, and did as the Lord commanded him, as appeareth in all the Hiſtory; but yet it appeareth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.14. hee taught <hi>Balak</hi> to lay a ſtumbling-block before the people, was that the part of a Prophet? yea according to the fore-named ſeeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions it was, and it was not; for in the truth of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin that he delivered to <hi>Balak,</hi> that that was the only way to bring a Curſe upon the people, to cauſe them to commit Idolatry, it was the part of a Prophet, but in that it became a ſnare to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it was the part of a Witch, or a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, yet God would have ſuch a thing come to paſs by his Prophet for the full illuſtration of this Doctrin in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65492:30"/>
(for our ſakes) that no Inchantment can hurt us, but the only thing that can hurt any man is ſinning againſt God, as God hath taught us elſewhere, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. the fourteen firſt verſes, the only way to be bleſt, is, to keep the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and from verſ. 15. to the end of the Chapter, the only way to be accurſt, is, to diſobey God, and break his Commandements. And whereas <hi>Balaam</hi> was blamed, and afterward ſlain for teaching this Doctrin ſo plain to <hi>Balak</hi> who abuſed it to inſnare <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet God hath taught us the ſame Doctrin, that we might know with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and by <hi>Iſraels</hi> example, that nothing can hurt us but ſin. So we may conclude of <hi>Balaam,</hi> that he was a Prophet, and yet acted the part of a Prophet and a Witch both at once (at leaſt) a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in that his Doctrine was true, a Witch, in that hee taught <hi>Balak</hi> to play the Witch, that is, to draw the people to Idolatry, according to the Firſt deſcription, which is the very eſſence of Witchcraft; and although God would have this thing come to paſs for our inſtruction, yet this was the errour of <hi>Balaam,</hi> That hee had laid open to <hi>Balak</hi> the way to bewitch he people, and in this only he tranſgreſſed, he did that which God had not commanded him, as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophets did beſides him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.18, 19, 22.</p>
               <p>To this Sixth deſcription of a Witch in the text, is referred that place in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.10. ſo commonly falſly interpreted as falſly tranſlated, <hi>Becauſe of Oathes the Land mourneth,</hi> as if it were meant of common Swearing, which although Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be a wicked thing, yet what room is there in that place for Swearing? unleſs yee will bring it in abruptly by head and ſhoulders, what coherence is there? <hi>Tremelius</hi> ttanſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it thus, <hi>The Land is full of Adulterers, and becauſe of Execrations the Land mourneth;</hi> Execrations is there taken for Incantations, being by a <hi>Synechdoche</hi> put for all kind of Witchcraft, being an inſeparable companion of Idolatry, Adulterers are taken for Idolaters in a Spiritual ſenſe, and the falſe Prophets that uſed theſe Incantations to ſeduce the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſpoken of, verſ. 1, 11, 13. who being falſe Prophets, or Witches, had defiled the Land with their ſeveral ſeducing Witchcrafts, leading the people to Idolatry, and in this
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65492:31"/>
practice of Charming Execrations, they were ſeducers of the people to repoſe confidence in ungrounded, and unwarranted compoſures of words to bring things to paſs, which words ſo compoſed are meer Incantations, or Charms.</p>
               <p>In this Sixth deſcription of a Witch in the text, or under the term of a Charmer, is contained Conjurers, who are Witches only in this ſenſe, That they pretend that by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of words they can do many things, and amongſt the reſt, that they can by vertue of words command the Devil, which yet is but a meer cheating deluſion to deceive poor Idolatrous people, who do more credit the vertue of words than they credit the truth of Gods Word; which fooliſh practice is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confuted, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.13. certain <hi>Exorciſts,</hi> or <hi>Conjurers,</hi> did take upon them to name over them that had evil Spirits, the name of the Lord Jeſus, ſaying, <hi>I adjure you by Jeſus whom</hi> Paul <hi>preacheth,</hi> and the Evil Spirits anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Jeſus I acknowledge, and</hi> Paul <hi>I know, but who are yee? Paul</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles did indeed caſt out Devils in the Name of Jeſus, but not by the bare naming of Jeſus, but by the ſpirit and power of Jeſus; but if words could have done it, then thoſe Conjurers might as well have done it, and then every one that could but imitate the Apoſtles, and the Prophets, and ſpeak the ſame words, or the like, might work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but God will have it known otherwiſe, as appeareth in this place of the <hi>Acts</hi> aforeſaid, That no words ſpoken, but the power of God bringeth things to paſs.</p>
               <p>This was the manner of Idolatrous <hi>Heathen,</hi> to repoſe great confidence in Charms, and they that ſtudied this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of making and compoſing of Charms to ſeduce the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to this kinde of Idolatry, were Witches, according to this Sixth deſcription in the text, <hi>Utens incantatione.</hi>

               <p>After theſe words ſpoken, ſay they, that Water ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured hath power and vertue to drive away the Devil, and with this Holy Water they uſe many ſeveral Conjurations to keep the Devil in awe; with it they Conjure him from their Churches and dwelling houſes, from their meat and drink, and the very Salt upon the Table; and if it were not for their continual Conjurations, they make people beleeve the Devil would walk every where, and kill, and devour, and carry away; therefore they Charm and Conjure their Bells in the Steeple (which they alſo Baptize and name by the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65492:33"/>
name of ſome Saint or Angel, and after theſe Ceremonies, (ſay they) and after ſuch holy names named over the Bells, and the name of ſome Saint or Angel given to each Bel, &amp; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon them, thoſe Bells have vertue to drive away and clear the air from Devils every where within the ſound of them, from whence was the firſt beginning of paſſing peals, that the Devils might not come near to carry away the Soul of the dying man (although our Church uſe (I confeſs) to ring ſuch peals only to give notice to their Neighbours, who deſire to ſee them, and to pray tor them before their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.) They alſo uſe Charms at Funerals, perſwading peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the Souls of the dead, and alſo their Bodies, would be carried away by the Devil, if it were not for their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (of which foppery <hi>Bucan</hi> a learned Theologian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth them, <hi>Loco</hi> 24. <hi>Quaeſtione</hi> 16.) and ſo the poor Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh people are deluded, ſo long as they ſee not the Devil in an ugly ſhape, they think they are ſafe, and the Devil farre enough, whereas the Devil is no where more than in a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Charm or Conjuration; and yet Maſter <hi>Scot</hi> hath colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in his twelfth Book ſo many Popiſh Charms, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth they had Conjurations, and other Charms for the Plague, the Quartain Feaver, the Conſumption, the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache, and all manner of Diſeaſes in Men and Cattel; and it appeareth ſtill among common ſilly country people, how they had learned Charms by tradition from Popiſh times, for curing Cattel, Men, Women, and Children; for churning of Butter, for baking their Bread, and many other occaſions; one or two whereof I will rehearſe only, for brevity.</p>
               <p>An old Woman in <hi>Eſſex</hi> who was living in my time, ſhe had lived alſo in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time, had learned thence many Popiſh Charms, one whereof was this; every night when ſhe lay down to ſleep ſhe charmed her Bed, ſaying;
<q>
                     <l>Matthew, Mark, Luke, <hi>and</hi> John,</l>
                     <l>The Bed be bleſt that I lye on.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And this would ſhe repeat three times, repoſing great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence therein, becauſe (as ſhe ſaid) ſhe had been taught
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65492:33"/>
it, when ſhe was a young Maid, by the Church-men of thoſe times.</p>
               <p>Another old Woman came into an houſe at a time when as the Maid was churning of Butter, and having labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red long and could not make her Butter come, the old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man told the Maid what was wont to be done when ſhe was a Maid, and alſo in her Mothers young time, that if it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened their Butter would not come readily, they uſed a Charm to be ſaid over it, whilſt yet it was in beating, and it would come ſtraight ways, and that was this:
<q>Come Butter come, come Butter come, <hi>Peter</hi> ſtands at the Gate, waiting for a buttered Cake, come Butter come.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This, ſaid the old Woman, being ſaid three times, will make your Butter come, for it was taught my Mother by a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Church-man in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, when as Church-men had more cunning, and could teach people many a trick, that our Miniſters now a days know not.</p>
               <p>Thus we may ſee ſtill how the Witchcrafts of that grand Witch, that Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> hath deceived all people; yet I would not have any think that I accuſe the old Wives for Witches, for they uſed theſe Charms not to ſeduce, but were ſeduced, and bewitched by them to repoſe confidence in them; but the Popiſh Rout, the contrivers of theſe Charms, to delude the people, were the Witches; thoſe poor deluded old Wives were Idolaters, Idolizing of words.</p>

               <head>A Devilliſh practice of Conjuring Charms uſed by the Popiſh Clergy, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at <hi>Orleance</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> acted chiefly by two Popiſh Doctors in Divinity, <hi>Colimanus,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus Aterbatenſis,</hi> and their Knavery found out.</head>
               <p>IN the place aforeſaid, in the year of our Lord, 1534. it happened that a Maiors Wife dyed, and was buried in the Church of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> her Husband giving the Popiſh Clergy only ſix Crowns at the Funeral, whereas they expected a greater Prey, and were much diſcontent; it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſhortly after, that as they were mumbling their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in a Popiſh manner, according to their uſual cuſtom, in the Church, there was heard in a ſecret Wainſcot over the Arches of the Church a great rumbling noyſe, the Moncks with the ſaid Doctors preſently began to Conjure, and to ask if it were not ſome ſpirit of ſome body lately dead, and if it wer, they conjured the ſame Spirit to rumble again by way of anſwer, which it did; then they charged him by their Conjurations to anſwer by rumbling and knocking whoſe ſpirit it was, they named many that had formerly been dead and buried, and the Spirit would not anſwer by rumbling and knocking when they named them; but at laſt to bring their purpoſe to paſs, they named the Maiors Wife, and then the Spirit rumbled exceedingly, and made a fearful noyſe, this they acted ſeveral times, that it might be known in the City, ſo that many people came to the hearing and witneſſing of tnis ſtrange Wonder; but at the laſt they by their Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had made the Spirit ſo tame, as it made them anſwer by knocking to any thing they deſired it ſhould anſwer; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when it anſwered not by knocking, then they concluded the thing was not ſo as they asked, or demanded, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65492:34"/>
when it knocked, then that was an affirmative to the thing asked; at laſt they made the Spirit confeſs by that manner of anſwering, That it was the departed Soul of the Maiors Wife, and that ſhe was damned for holding the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of <hi>Luther,</hi> and that ſhe deſired that her Body might be taken up again and buried in ſome other place, for that place was not fit for the body of the Damned, being a Conſecrated place. But the Maior being wiſe, and full of courage, ſo handled the matter, that he with the help of ſome of the City that loved him well, cauſed the place to bee ſearched where the noyſe was; the Moncks did take the matter grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly, and would have reſiſted, it being at a time of the holy Conjuring, but yet the Maior cauſing a ſearch, found there a young Boy, placed there by theſe Popiſh Doctors, on purpoſe to act the part of a Spirit, as formerly related, and upon examination he confeſſed the whole impoſture, to the ſhame and confuſion of the Actors and Contrivers thereof, who were by the Laws (which were then and there free notwithſtanding the Popiſh Tyranny) cenſured to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the place of Execution, there to confeſs their delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Witchcraft.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader take ſpecial notice, that the Actors, and Contrivers of this notable peece of Witchcraft were Witches in a three-fold ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In their bringing to paſs their cheating impoſture, by confederating with a young Boy to act the part of a Spirit, they were Juglers, according to the firſt term of deſcription.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In their Charms and Conjurations, whereby they charged the Spirit to anſwer them they were Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Conjurers, according to this Sixth term of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In their conſulting with the ſpirit of the dead, the Maiors Wife, they were Necromancers, according to the Ninth term of deſcription.</p>
               <p>This Impoſture may be paralleled with that of the Witch of <hi>Endor;</hi> from this couſening Witchcraft of the Popiſh crue, our common Wizards have learned their craft of couſening the people, making them beleeve they can Conjure

up the Devil to give them Oracles according to the matter that they ſeek to the Wizard to be reſolved of, and can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure him down again at their pleaſure. As for example, I will give you a true ſtory, but whether you beleeve it or not, it will ſerve to illuſtrate the manner of their decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</p>
               <p>A Butcher in <hi>Eſſex</hi> having loſt Cattel, hee reſolved hee would go to a Cunning man, to know what was become of his Cattel, and ſo went to a notable couſening Knave, that was (as common people ſay) skilful in the Black Art, and this deceiving Witch, ſeeing his opportunity of gaining a Fee, for the purpoſe in hand, uſed his Conjurations in a room contrived for his uſual impoſtures, and preſently came in a Confederate of his covered over with a Bulls Hide, and a pair of horns on his head, the poor Butcher ſitting and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Glaſs made for that purpoſe, in which hee was to behold the Object more terrible, and not ſo eaſily diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as if he had looked right upon it, for he was charged by the Conjurer not to look behind him, for if he did, the Devil would be outragious; this confederate, or counterfeit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, after the Conjurers many exorciſing Charms, or Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, willed the Butcher to look Eaſt and Weſt, North and South to finde his Cattel; the Butcher ſought much to finde his Cattel according to the Devils counſel, but yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving after much ſeeking and not finding, that it was a meer peece of Knavery, returned to the Conjurer again, and deſired him to call up the Devil once again, which he did as formerly, but the Butcher had appointed his Boy to ſtand near hand Without the houſe with a Maſtiff Dogge, and at the Butchers whiſtle, the Boy as he was appointed, let go the Dogge, which came in preſently to his Maſter, and ſeiſed upon the Knave in the Bulls hide; the Conjurer cried out, as likewiſe the Devil, <hi>For the love of God take off your Dogge, Nay,</hi> ſaid the Butcher, <hi>fight Dogge, fight Devil, if you will venture your Devil, I will venture my Dogge;</hi> but yet after much intreaty he called off his Dogge, but wittily diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the cheating craft of Conjuring.</p>
               <p>He that acteth the part as this Conjurer did, with the ſame
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65492:35"/>
intent to deceive, and to make ſilly people beleeve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe confidence in words (that is, in Charms and Conjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to command the Devil, and to keep him in awe) is a ſeducing Witch, as he was; but he that acteth the ſame part, and cauſeth people to wonder at him, and to think that hee hath really conjured the Devil, to this intent only to ſhew to the world in a ſporting way, how eaſily people are and have been deceived, is no Witch, but may be an inſtructer and inlightner of ſilly people, according to the Fifth deſcription of Jugling deluſions, in <hi>Pag.</hi> 42. And truly (if people were not ſo much naturally given to vain credulity, or beleeving of Lyes) that ſort of Conjurers (ſo commonly prated of by ſilly people) had not been heard of in the world, had not theſe deluders learned this couſening craft from the Popiſh rout, whereby they delude ſilly people, making them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve they do things really by vertue of words, as by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the Trinity, and the ſeveral names of God, and of Chriſt, and by naming of Angels, Arch-Angels, and the Apoſtles (juſt the ſame with Popiſh Conjurations) whereas their doings, as likewiſe the Popes, are all but cheating im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, for if Conjuring Charms could keep the Devil in awe, why did hee not ſubmit to the Conjurers, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.13?</p>

There was a Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Boy in the Inne at that time, who had by wanton cuſtom gotten a faculty of imitating the crowing of a Cock, the neighing of a Horſe, the barking of a Dogge, the quacking of Ducks, and the noyſe of many ſeveral Beaſts, in a very wonderful manner; the Scholar therefore, for the lively acting of the foreſaid Deluſion, went down, and inſtructed this Boy to bring up a Jugge of Beer, and to ſet it down by the fire, and then to convey himſelf under the Bed, and withall to act the part of all ſeveral Creatures as the Scholar ſhould call for them by Conjuration; now when this Boy had ſo conveyed himſelf under the Bed, the Scholar did put out the Candle, and left no light in the Chamber but the obſcure light of a dim fire, the reliques of an Oſtree Faggot, and ſaid to the Miniſter, Now will I make you beleeve that I Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure up the Devil, Come <hi>Pluto,</hi> I have a Letter to be ſent with all ſpeed to the Pope, therefore I conjure and command thee to come ſpeedily to me from the loweſt pit, in the ſhape of a ſwift running Horſe, that may carry this Letter with ſpeed, and bring me an anſwer; then began the Boy to ſnort, and neigh, and ſtamp, very much reſembling a wilde marwood Horſe, in ſo lively a reſemblance, as it made the Miniſter begin to look ſad, and amazed; then ſaid the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Now I have well conſidered the matter, thou art not a Creature ſwift enough for this buſineſs, therefore I conjure thee down again, and I command <hi>Pluto</hi> to come to me in the ſhape of a Grey-hound, <hi>Praeſto, vade, jubeo, celeriter;</hi> then the Boy under the Bed barked, and howled ſo like a Dogge, as the Miniſter did more and more creep cloſe to the corner
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65492:36"/>
of the Chimney, ſighing very ſadly. Then ſaid the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, I conſider that thou art not ſwift enough for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, therefore I command thee to return to thy place, and ſend me up a Cock; then the Boy crowed ſo like a Cock, as no ear ſhould diſtinguiſh it from a natural Cock; then ſaid the Scholar, Thou art not a Creature ſwift enough for my purpoſe, therefore I command <hi>Pluto</hi> to ſend me up a Duck; at that command the Boy did ſo lively act the quacking of Ducks, as a man would have thought that many Ducks had been in the room. Then began the Miniſter ſeriouſly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and admoniſh the Scholar, ſaying, <hi>Verily thou art farre gone, certainly thou art farre gone in this craft,</hi> and many more words; at which ſo ſad diſcourſe, the Boy under the Bed burſt out in laughter, and came forth and acted his part again openly, and made the Miniſter aſhamed.</p>
               <p>Yet here it may be noted, that the Miniſters phantaſie was ſo farre deluded, that he would not be perſwaded, but that he ſaw real Ducks ſquirming about the room, as he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, how little credit ought Miniſters or other men to give to flying Reports, when they themſelves may ſo eaſily be deluded? The ſetting of Spels is referred to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and is done only by confederacy with him that is ſpelled; who feigneth himſelf ſo Charmed, or ſpelled, that others who would be in like action of Theevery, might fear to come into that place to ſteal, becauſe of the Spel.</p>

So much ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> who plainly expoundeth, that that ſpirit of Divination, or Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65492:38"/>
was only a Devilliſh deluding impoſture, and not a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Devil, as many do fondly imagine. And whereas it is ſaid in the verſe following, that <hi>Paul</hi> did caſt that Spirit out of the Maid, it was, that he by the power of the Goſpel of Jeſus rebuked her wickedneſs, ſo that her Conſcience being terrified, ſhe was either converted, or elſe at the leaſt dared not to follow that deluding craft of Divination any longer; as when Chriſt did caſt out ſeven Devils out of <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> it is to be underſtood that he did convert her from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Devilliſh ſinful courſes in which ſhe had walked, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.2. and 7.47.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65492:38"/>
to go into a ſecret conveyance, and to make anſwer to the inquiry, with a hollow ſounding voyce, cauſed by the Bottle, and ſo it ſeemed to the ſilly deluded people, that the voyce came out of the firm ground, as an anſwer ſent by the gods, by the departed ſoul of ſome Prophet, or other man that had formerly died (in which ſenſe alſo they were called <hi>Necromantiſts,</hi> from asking counſel of the dead, being the Ninth term of deſcription) for which impoſture all Idol houſes, and houſes of all ſuch other Witches as practiſed the ſame impoſture, that the Idol-Prieſts did practice, were built and contrived on purpoſe with a room called <hi>Manteum,</hi> in which the ſaid Cave and hollow paſſage was, in which room ſome fond Writers do ſay, that the Devil ſpake, but had it been ſo, that a real familiar Devil had anſwered, as is fondly imagined, why then did he anſwer only in that room? Surely if their Devil was ſo familiar, and at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he might as well have anſwered in any room as in that, but a confederate man or woman could not bring to paſs the impoſture in any room but in that.</p>

Shall they ask counſel of the dead for them that are living? And here in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 29.4. the Prophet alludeth not to all the impoſtures of ſuch Oracling Idols, which were many, but only to this one impoſture, from whence they had their deſcription, or term of appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65492:39"/>
from ſpeaking in a Bottle out of the earth. In this ſenſe the <hi>Pythoniſt</hi> of <hi>Endor</hi> was called <hi>Mulier pythone pradita,</hi> a Woman indued with an Oracle, or with the impoſture of Oracling, becauſe ſhe made it ſeem by the foreſaid impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, to ſilly, deluded, or bewitched people, that the dead ſpake out of the earth, by which impoſture ſhe deluded <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. And becauſe that Hiſtory of the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> hath been commonly miſ-interpreted, and many unwary Readers do beleeve, that that which ſhe did was ſomewhat more than a couſening impoſture, and that ſhe did either raiſe up <hi>Samuel,</hi> or the Devil in the likeneſs of <hi>Samuel,</hi> or aſſuming the body of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſpeaking in it (where by the way it is to be noted, that if any ſuch things were, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nothing to prove the common error, that a Witch is any where at all taken for a Murtherer; for the ſcope of all that ſhe did, was only at laſt to give an Oracle, or Divination to <hi>Saul</hi>) yet let but ſuch a Reader as thinketh ſhe did any thing really; examine well the Chapter, and he ſhall finde, it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a deluding cheating impoſture by a confederate in the ground, and he that will not beleeve this, let him but gather up his Objections, and I will lay down my Anſwers as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>The firſt Objection, or ground of miſtake, is, the twelfth verſe of the Chapter, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. <hi>And when the woman ſaw Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, &amp;c.</hi> Here perhaps you wil ſay, it is plain ſhe ſaw <hi>Samuel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is not here to be underſtood according to the letter of the Hiſtory, neither did yet any Expoſitor ſo underſtand it, for it may not be ſuppoſed that any Devilliſh Craft can call a Saint from Heaven; no, but you will ſay, It was the Devil in the likeneſs of <hi>Samuel;</hi> I anſwer, If you hold to the letter of the Hiſtory, you muſt ſay it was real <hi>Samuel,</hi> but if you vary from the letter, whence then can you gather that it was the Devil? And why is not this Expoſition true, that ſhe only pretended that ſhe ſaw <hi>Samuel,</hi> to bring about her couſening impoſture? for I have made it plain in all the diſcourſe of this Book by the current of the Scriptures, that all Witchcraft was only a deluſion, and to ſay that it was the body of <hi>Samuel</hi> raiſed up by the Devil, is to make the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65492:39"/>
Devil able to work the ſame Miracle that was wrought by Chriſt upon the Croſs, who by the power of his God-head raiſed up the Bodies of the Saints, for a time, who appeared unto many, from whence the Centurion concluded, that Chriſt was the Son of God, knowing that no other power was able to do it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.52, 53, 54.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Objection may be, ſhe learned of <hi>Samuel</hi> that it was <hi>Saul,</hi> as in the twelfth verſe, <hi>And when the woman ſaw</hi> Samuel <hi>ſhe ſaid unto</hi> Saul, <hi>why haſt thou deceived me, for thou art Saul?</hi> therefore ſhe ſaw him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſeeing of <hi>Samuel</hi> could inſtruct her nothing, if living <hi>Samuel</hi> had been there, much leſs dead <hi>Samuel,</hi> nor ſeeing the Devil in <hi>Samuels</hi> likeneſs, for neither the body of <hi>Samuel,</hi> nor the Devil, was a Looking-glaſs to ſee <hi>Saul</hi> in, but it was her ſubtill pretence, and colour, that ſhe had ſeen <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſo found out <hi>Saul</hi> by her craft, whom ſhe knew before; think you that this ſubtill Wizard did not know the King? when ſhe dwelt nigh the Kings Court, as appeareth in the Chapter, for he went thither and ſtayed while ſhe acted her part, and after a while ſhe prepared meat, and he and his Servants did eat, and returned the ſame night. But you may ſay, he was diſguiſed. <hi>Anſ.</hi> He was taller than all the men in <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the head and ſhoulders, and without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelf ſo much the ſhorter, he could not but be known by a ſubtill Wizard. Alſo I anſwer; That the Servants of <hi>Saul,</hi> that could ſo readily tell him where he ſhould finde ſuch a woman at <hi>Endor,</hi> could not but be intimate with her, and ſo warn her of <hi>Sauls</hi> coming, or give her ſome diſcovery of the preſent occaſion, at their coming along with <hi>Saul,</hi> or elſe how could they have concealed her, and kept her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in the time a little before, when <hi>Saul</hi> had made ſtrict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation that all Wizards ſhould be baniſhed the Land, as they were; and doubtleſs had not thoſe ſervants concealed her, ſhe had alſo been baniſhed. Again, <hi>Saul</hi> could not but diſcover himſelf to her, by his Oath that he ſware to her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before, for who was able to ſave her from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but the King.</p>
               <p>Another Objection is, <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf ſaw <hi>Samuel,</hi> or the Devil in his likeneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:65492:40"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is plain in the Hiſtory, he ſaw neither <hi>Samuel,</hi> nor his likeneſs, for he ſaid to the woman in verſ. 13, 14. <hi>What ſaweſt thou, and what form and faſhion is he of?</hi> where it is plain, he was only too credulous, and beleeved that ſhe had ſeen ſome apparition, for if he had ſeen any thing himſelf, why did he ſay, <hi>What ſaweſt thou?</hi> She anſwered, <hi>I ſaw an old man cloathed in a mantle,</hi> making a true deſcription of <hi>Samuel,</hi> becauſe ſhe knew that he was the man that <hi>Saul</hi> deſired, then <hi>Saul</hi> acknowledged that it was <hi>Samuel,</hi> only from her deſcribing of him, verſ. 14. and therefore bowed himſelf with his face to the ground in honour to <hi>Samuel,</hi> whom he expected ſhould anſwer him out of the earth.</p>
               <p>Another Objection is; But <hi>Samuel</hi> talked with <hi>Saul?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is proved before that <hi>Saul</hi> ſaw no body, therefore <hi>Saul</hi> only heard a voyce which he imagined came from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> but was only the voyce of a Confederate under the ground.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, that the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Saul, Why haſt thou diſquieted me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If you hold me to the letter of the Hiſtory, why do you not hold your ſelf to it, but ſay, it was the Devil in the likeneſs of <hi>Samuel,</hi> as that it was real <hi>Samuel</hi> you will not ſay, why not a Confederate then? and here indeed the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is ſet down only according to the apprehenſion of <hi>Saul,</hi> not diſcovering the impoſture.</p>
               <p>But how ſhould ſhe deſcribe a man ſo like <hi>Samuel?</hi> that is, an old man cloathed in a mantle?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The only noted Prophet in <hi>Iſrael</hi> was known to all, and could not be unknown to a ſubtil Wizard, whoſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice was to be acquainted with all things of note, the bettet to help her craft of Oracling Divinations upon any occaſion for gain.</p>
               <p>Another Objection, But if it were not <hi>Samuel,</hi> nor the Devil, what Confederate was able to tell <hi>Saul</hi> ſo right, and give ſo true an Oracle of what ſhould betide <hi>Saul</hi> the next day in the battel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> All ſuch Oraclers and Wizards did give Oracles two ways.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65492:40"/>Firſt, In doubtful things, they gave doubtful anſwers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Where were more certain probabilities, there they gave more certain anſwers. Now what was more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than that the Kingdom ſhould be rent from <hi>Saul? Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> had Propheſied of it, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> knew it; and what was more probable than that the time was at hand, when ſo mighty an Hoſt of his enemies were come againſt him, when his heart and ſpirit failed him, and when God had forſaken him? and if it had not come to paſs, ſuch Oraclers did uſe to have evaſions, the fault might have been laid upon <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muels</hi> Ghoſt, and further couſenage might ſtill have been wrought to blinde <hi>Sauls</hi> eyes; and had it happened how it could, ſo that the Witch had come off blewly, and her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture been afterward known to <hi>Saul,</hi> yet ſhe had the Oath of the King to ſave her harmleſs.</p>
               <p>Further, it is the opinion of ſome learned men, that there was no certainty at all in the anſwer given to <hi>Saul,</hi> and that it was meerly conjectural, and though happening ſome way true, yet it failed in the day prefixed, for whereas it was ſaid, <hi>To morrow ſhalt thou and thy Sons be with me,</hi> verſ. 9. it was very falſe, for when the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> went up to Battel, <hi>David</hi> returning was three days marching back to <hi>Ziglag,</hi> 1 Sam. 30.1. and one day purſuing his enemies, verſ. 17. and the third day after that, tidings was brought to <hi>David</hi> from the Camp of <hi>Saul,</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> and his Sons were dead, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4. which made in all ſeven days, and therefore it was not likely that <hi>Saul</hi> and his Sons were ſlain upon the morrow, which was the ſcope of the Oracle, or anſwer that was given to <hi>Saul;</hi> this I ſay, is the opinion of a learned Writer. So much by the way.</p>
               <p>Further, if it had not been a meer deluſion to blinde the eyes of <hi>Saul,</hi> why muſt <hi>Samuel</hi> bee deſcribed an old man cloathed in a mantle? That indeed was the faſhion of living <hi>Samuel,</hi> but after he was dead and buried, had <hi>Samuel</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as ſhe pretended, or had the Devil appeared in his likeneſs, as ſome fond Readers ſuppoſe he did, it muſt have been like <hi>Samuel</hi> in a Winding-ſheet; but indeed had ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him by his Winding-ſheet, that might have been

If you think it an incredible thing that <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould be ſo eaſily deluded, look <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 8.20. in the Latine tranſlation (which carrieth the true ſenſe of the Original, how odly ſoever our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlators run) where the Prophet ſpeaking of ſuch as would counſel men to ſeek to Oraclers and South-ſayers, he faith (in <hi>Tremelius) An non loquuntur in ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam illam cuicun<expan>

               <p>This impoſture of ſpeaking in the Belly hath been often practiſed in theſe latter days in many places, and namely in this Iſland of <hi>England,</hi> and they that practiſe it do it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to this end, to draw many ſilly people to them, to ſtand wondring at them, that ſo by the concourſe of people money may be given them, for they by this impoſture do make the people beleeve that they are poſſeſſed by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, ſpeaking within them, and tormenting them, and ſo do by that pretence move the people to charity, to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral to them.</p>

               <p>This impoſture hath wrought ſtrange deluſions among the ancient Heathen, and the actors thereof did by this impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture delude the people; one way very notable was (by them

ſpeaking in the Belly in the manner aforeſaid) they would make it ſeem to the ſtanders by that a voyce came from afar off, or from ſome ſecret place, &amp; that that voyce was the voyce of ſome of the gods, and then they would report abroad that in ſuch a place a voyce was heard, declaring, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſuch and ſuch matters, and the poor deluded ſtanders by would witneſs, and report the ſame to be true, whereas the voyce came only from the deluding Witch that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them when they heard the voyce; as we may read in <hi>Plutarch de defec.

               <p>A certain ſhip ſayling by the Iſland of <hi>Paxis</hi> (in which ſhip were ſome <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> the manner of which Nation was to practiſe the ſeveral impoſtures of Witchcraft, for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and fame among the people) there was heard from the ſhore of <hi>Paxis</hi> a voyce, calling thrice to <hi>Thamus</hi> by name, (he being an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> in the ſhip) <hi>Thamus,</hi> when thou comeſt to <hi>Palos,</hi> report that great <hi>Pan</hi> is dead, which thing he did. When he came near <hi>Palos</hi> he looked toward the ſhore, and cryed aloud, Great <hi>Pan</hi> is dead; then there was heard a terrible ſighing and groaning, which much affrighted the people in the ſhip; the report of this was ſpeedily teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſo much that this <hi>Thamus</hi> was ſent for by <hi>Tyberius Caeſar,</hi> and ſo was much taken notice of in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Court; and although many were deluded by that voyce, which was ſo heard by the men in the ſhip, and did much diſpute about it what it ſhould ſignifie, yet they that do rightly underſtand the impoſture of Hariolating, or ſpeaking in the belly, may eaſily conceive that <hi>Thamus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was the man, or ſome confederate with him, that ſpake the voyce, and made that mighty groaning at the laſt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to delude the people, and to make himſelf famous, as ſome great Man, to whom ſome of the gods had ſpoken; and whereas it was about the time that Chriſt was Crucified, And ſome would have it that that voyce was really ſpoken by ſome ſtrange Spirit, and might ſignifie Chriſt: I yeeld thus farre, that <hi>Thamus</hi> himſelf might have heard the ſame of the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Life, and Death, and Reſurrection of Chriſt, and might ſpeak of, and concerning Chriſt, not that he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65492:44"/>
beleeved in Chriſt, but would tell ſome notable thing in his own deluding way, for the magnifying of himſelf among the people, implying, that he was the man to whom ſuch a voyce ſhould come from the gods; and whereas he ſaid, Great <hi>Pan</hi> is dead, it was becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> were the poſterity of Shepherds, and the Heathen had feigned <hi>Pan</hi> to be the god of Shepherds; thus might he mean Chriſt, as the Maid in the <hi>Acts,</hi> ch. 16.16. acknowledged <hi>Paul</hi> and his Doctrin, not by belief, but thereby to uphold and countenance her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture among the people, for her own fame and gain; ſo might this Impoſtor mean Chriſt, although, nor he, nor any other, did ever conclude any thing fully concerning the meaning of that voyce, but left it doubtful (as all Oracles of the Heathen were) inſomuch that ſome told <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that it was ſpoken from the gods of one that was riſen up between <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Penelopa.</hi> Thus did <hi>Thamus</hi> by his impoſture get himſelf fame at the Emperours Court (which was the thing he aimed at) and left ſuperſtitious fools diſputing of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Oracle.</p>
               <p>It hath been credibly reported, that there was a man in the Court, in King <hi>James</hi> his days, that could act this impoſture ſo lively that he could call the King by name, and cauſe the King to look round about him, wondring who it was that called him, whereas he that called him ſtood before him in his preſence, with his face toward him, but after this impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture was known, the King in his merriment would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times take occaſion by this Impoſtor to make ſport upon ſome of his Courtiers; as for inſtance, There was a Knight belonging to the Court, whom the King cauſed to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in his private room (where no man was but the King, and this Knight, and the Impoſtor) and feigned ſome occaſion of ſerious diſcourſe with the Knight; but when the King began to ſpeak, and the Knight bending his attention to the King, ſuddenly there came a voyce as out of another room, calling the Knight by name, Sir <hi>John,</hi> Sir <hi>John,</hi> come away Sir <hi>John;</hi> at which the Knight began to frown, that any man ſhould be ſo unmannerly as to moleſt the King and him; and ſtill liſtning to the Kings diſcourſe, the voyce came again,

               <p>The Seventh and Eighth terms of deſcription do imply the impoſtures which theſe deluding Witches uſed in their Oracling Divinations; this Ninth term of deſcription im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth their pretence which they had in thoſe couſening im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, that is, they pretended that they conſulted with the ſouls of them that were departed this life, and thereby could tell things to come, or things hidden; and this was one pretence of all that were Oraclers, or South-ſayers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which pretence they were called <hi>Necroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,</hi> according to that place in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19. (very fitly rehearſed again in this deſcription) in <hi>Tremellius</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For when they ſhall ſay unto you, Ask counſel of Oraclers and South-ſayers, that whiſper, and that mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhould not a people ask counſel of their God? ſhall they ask counſel of the dead for them that are living? And this pretence of theſe Witches is manifeſt, not only in the Scriptures, but in common Writers, where we may read the Tenents, and the Opinions of the Heathen concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter, <hi>Plutarch de defec. orac.</hi> ſheweth their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and vain conceits, That the ſouls of men that were departed this life, were of more excellent perfection, than the ſouls of men in the priſon of the body; and theſe were by thoſe vain Heathen called <hi>Genii,</hi> which <hi>Genii</hi> or departed ſouls (ſay they) being of ſuch perfection, and having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe familiarity with the gods, would (when they were ſought unto by men living here) come and inſpire them to give Divinations, which they could eaſily do, by reaſon of their perfect eſtate after this life. Theſe were by ſome of the Heathen called, and eſteemed gods, and were among the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Manes,</hi> that is, Infernal gods, or ſouls of men, to whom they offered Sacrifices, called <hi>Inferiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Pythoniſt,</hi> or Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> did act her part ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly, that ſhe did not only pretend inſpiration from the Soul of <hi>Samuel,</hi> but (to ſatisfie <hi>Sauls</hi> inſatiable blindneſs in his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65492:46"/>
demand) that ſhe could call him up, and make him appear to her, both Body and Soul united again, to propheſie again to <hi>Saul;</hi> which thing indeed was acted by her according to the ſillineſs of <hi>Sauls</hi> demand, as appeareth more fully in the Seventh deſcription, who, after the Spirit of God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him, was given over to beleeve ſuch fooliſh fancies of faithleſs and ignorant people, as ſilly Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and fools are inclined to beleeve unto this day, that people after their death can walk, and frequent the Houſes, and Gardens, and Orchards, where they have uſed to be in their life time, which thing is a meer fancy of faithleſs and ignorant people, and cannot be brought to paſs by either Witch or Devil, either really, or in appearance; for it was a Miracle once done by the power of Chriſt at his ſuffering upon the Croſs, that many of the bodies of the Saints that were departed roſe, and appeared unto many in the holy City, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.52, 53. from whence the Centurion acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Chriſt to be the Son of God, knowing that ſuch things could not be done but by the mighty power of God; and he that readeth over the foreſaid Book of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> ſhall eaſily finde, that one of the chief grounds of Oracles and Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was this vain conceit of the Heathen, that wanted the light of the Scriptures, that the ſouls of dead men did give anſwers to them that had knowledge in the Art of ſeeking of Oracles; which Art indeed was only a craft of working im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures to delude the people, as is ſet down more at large in the Seventh and Eighth deſcriptions; and from this old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Heathen, and practice of theſe deluding Witches of ancient times, hath that grand Witch, that Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> (the Pope and his train) derived her notable Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, whereby ſhe hath deluded the world, teaching people to invocate the ſouls of Saints departed, as likewiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure them.</p>
               <p>Let but the Reader look back to the Sixth term of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription (a Charmer) and there he may read of a notable peece of <hi>Necromancy</hi> acted by two Popiſh Doctors at <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> with their devilliſh Conjurations. Theſe <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Witches are the <hi>Necromancers</hi> of theſe latter Ages, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65492:46"/>
to this Ninth deſcription; theſe are the Inchanters of theſe latter Ages, as is fully demonſtrated in the Sixth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; theſe are the Jugling Witches of theſe latter Ages in the Chriſtian world, as is fully demonſtrated in the Fifth deſcription, and therefore it is ſaid of this Purple Whore, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> 18.23. with thy Witchcrafts all Nations were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And he that will be zealous for God, in obeying the command given in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Suffer not a Witch to live,</hi> muſt leave his fond ignorant courſe of teaching people to hang up poor, and widows, and aged, and lame help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs people, and muſt bend his devotion againſt that Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> (as all the world ought to do) as alſo againſt the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Witches among the <hi>Turks.</hi> Therefore it were a good Law in <hi>England,</hi> if duly kept, That no Jeſuite, or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſt ſhould be ſuffered to live, in any part of theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, becauſe theſe Witches are they that bewitch the people (where they be tollerated) by their ſeveral deluding impoſtures, leading the people to Idolatry, and alſo to the undermining of Governments. So much for the Ninth term of deſcription of a Witch in the text, a <hi>Necromantiſt,</hi> one that asketh counſel of the dead.</p>
               <p>The falſe Prophets of ancient times having their ſeveral impoſtures and pretences, whereby they ſeduced the people to vain Idolatry, which was abominable to Gods eyes, are hereby the Spirit of God demonſtrated to the world by the Nine ſeveral terms of deſcription in the text, that the world might fully know the myſtery of iniquity, and avoyd all ſuch evil workers, as deceivers of his people, and learn to know God, and his Prophets, who teach people the right way of God; and theſe are the terms of expreſſions that are uſed in the Old Teſtament to demonſtrate falſe Prophets, according to which expreſſions wee uſe the general word Witch, or Sorcerer, in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, and do finde no other ſort of Witches ſpoken of in the Scriptures. What ſort of Witches ſoever are ſpoken of in the New Teſtament, are all taken in the ſame ſenſe that they, are in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are ſufficiently gloſſed at the beginning of this Book, upon the Definition of a Witch, and Witchcraft; but
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65492:47"/>
yet in <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.15. there is found a word that is uſed as a general expreſſion for all ſorts of Witches, which word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath been abuſed by ſome Popiſh Expoſitors, and blinde interpreters, diſputing upon the ſame word uſed by the Septuagint, it may not be omitted to ſpeak ſomewhat of it, the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſignifying by Etimology a Poyſoner, or a compounder of Poyſons, and is tranſlated <hi>veneficus,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying alſo a Poyſoner, and yet both words both in Greek and Latine are uſed commonly for a Witch in general of all ſorts, and is ſo taken in that place of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and from hence ſome that are willing to uphold fond Opinions, do draw this fond concluſion, That a Witch is ſuch a one as killeth people by Poyſons, and can infect the Air, and bring many mortal Diſeaſes by Witchcraft, and by the ſame craft can kill any particular Man or Beaſt with looks, by poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Air in a direct line, as ſome feign of the Cockatrice. But what Logician will not ſay it is an abſurdity to draw a Concluſion, and ground an opinion, from the bare ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of words? and yet for the words, it is eaſily conceived, that a Witch was firſt called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

So then, to conclude with <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65492:47"/>
we read not in all the Old or New Teſtament of a Killing Witch, or Murthering Witch, but only of deceiving Witches, Impoſtors, or falſe Prophets, ſeducing people to Idolatry by their deluſions and impoſtures.</p>
               <p>He that will have any further deſcription of a Witch, let him take this deſcription; A Witch is as like a Prophet as can be, and yet a deceiving falſe Prophet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.13. A Decree went forth from the King, that the Magicians ſhould be ſlain, and they ſought <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellows to be ſlain; there the Executioners knew no difference between the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and <hi>Daniel,</hi> that was a Prophet, for the word Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, or Wiſe men, being properly taken in a good ſenſe, was equivocally given to South-ſayers, and all ſorts of deceiving Witches, as well as to thoſe that were termed Wiſe men, and as to the Prophets themſelves, and under that Decree <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf had been ſlain, if it had not been ſtayed by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</p>

they were accounted Prophets among the Heathen, yet are all aimed at, and deſcribed in the text for Witches, and South-ſayers, and ſuch as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (being a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen people, to be taught by God and his Prophets) were commanded to deſtroy, that no ſuch bewitching falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſhould be found among them; ſuch a one was <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer, called both a Sorcerer, and a falſe Prophet, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.6. and theſe were ſuch as were ſometimes great, Scholars, yet abuſing their learning.</p>
               <p>Some may object and ſay, <hi>If Witches were only falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, then all falſe Teachers are Witches?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A Witch and a falſe Prophet are reciprocal terms, but not a Witch and a falſe Teacher, for all the Nine terms of deſcription in the text are plainly deſcribing Witches and falſe Prophets as one and the ſame, and having one of theſe two properties;</p>
               <p>Firſt, He ſetteth up an Idol, which is the firſt main Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, being the firſt deſcription in the text; or,</p>
               <p>Secondly, He uſeth ſome, or all of the eight following Witchcrafts deſcribed in the text, either to confirm and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his Idol by ſeducing the people, or elſe to make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple beleeve that he is a true Prophet of God, as did <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and as is rehearſed in the ſame Chapter in the text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.20. for the more full and general deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Witch, or falſe Prophet, which was deſcribed in the text, by Nine ſpecifical deſcriptions, ſpecifying the Nine Witchcrafts of ſuch ſeducing falſe Prophets: but yet it doth not follow that all falſe Teachers are Witches; for a man may be a falſe Teacher through weakneſs of underſtanding, and error of judgement (as were the Scribes and Phariſes in ſome things) and yet not a Witch; but he that is a wilful upholder of Hereſies, or any vain unprofitable Doctrin, only to draw people to a head to uphold his own gain, and ſo for gain maketh the people to miſs of the ſincerity of Religion, although he be no Impoſtor, nor bringeth himſelf within the compaſs of the puniſhment due to a Witch from the Civil Magiſtrate, becauſe he doth not uſe impoſtures, or any of the Nine Witchcrafts deſcribed in the text, yet in his intent
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65492:48"/>
he maketh gain his end, and perverteth ſouls in a ſmooth pretence of holineſs. I know not how his final intention dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from the final intention of a Witch (that is, gain by ſeducing the people) nor whether he or a Witch ſhall have the greateſt condemnation at the laſt day, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.30. for it appeareth in verſ. 20. following the text, that a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet conſidered diſtinctly from the foreſaid impoſtors, is in the ſame Condemnation, and the ſame with a Witch, and ought to be cenſured by the Civil Magiſtrate to dye as a Witch, meerly <hi>quatenus</hi> a falſe Prophet; for although he bee deſcribed by his ſeveral impoſtures before in the text, yet the bare uſing of impoſtures maketh not a Witch, unleſs by them he be a falſe Prophet; (as is demonſtrated more fully in the Fifth deſcription) ſo then, the <hi>Formalis ratio</hi> of a Witch, or that which maketh him to be a Witch, is becauſe he is a falſe Prophet, ſo that it followeth, that as every wilful falſe teacher, or wilful upholder of Hereſie, or any vain unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Doctrin to ſeduce the people for gain, differeth not in his final intention from a falſe Prophet, ſo by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he differeth not from a Witch; and although he cannot always be convicted by the Magiſtrate, yet in Gods ſight he is a very Witch.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlators not knowing the difference of the terms of deſcription in the text, by the ſeveral impoſtures therein implied, according to the intent and meaning of the Scriptures, have uſed words promiſcuouſly one for another, without expreſſing the true and full meaning of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſo well, as is expreſt by <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> in Latine, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11. they call a Diviner a Witch, and a South-ſayer a Wizard, expreſſing ſpecifical deſcriptions by general words, that may be as well given to any of the nine; and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.18. they call a Jugler a Witch, uſing the ſame general expreſſion that they uſed before, for one that uſeth Divination, or a Diviner; they call a Planetarian an obſerver of times, a phraſe more obſcure than can imply the original meaning of the Scriptures; they call a Conjecturer an Inchanter, and they call an Inchanter a Charmer, whereas in the Original and Latine Tranſlations, an Inchanter, and a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65492:49"/>
Charmer is all one term of deſcription; they call an Oracler one that hath a familiar Spirit, and that may be as well given to any of the Nine terms in the text (by the ſame reaſon that all Witches have a familiar ſpirit, according to the common tenent, though it cannot be proved that any had any, otherwiſe than the ſpirit of error ruling in their hearts.) And 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.6. there they call uſing Divinations, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of times, which phraſe they uſed before for a Planeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian; and if we compare ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlations, wee may finde them much varying one from another in tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of thoſe terms, not but that they were good and able Linguiſts, but not knowing the ſeveral impoſtures implyed in theſe original terms of deſcription, could not expreſs them in ſuch apt words in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as if they had known the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of iniquity according to the original ſenſe and meaning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44.5. they tranſlate it, <hi>Is not this the cup by which my Maſter divineth?</hi> Here they would make Witchcraft lawful, (for Divination is Witchcraft) but the original ſenſe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo as they tranſlate it; look <hi>Tremellius.</hi> All this argueth that theſe our ancient Biſhops and great Clerks knew not what Witchcraft was in the Scripture ſenſe.</p>

light ſhine forth;</hi> and thus it was fulfilled at his coming. The Nations that were given to Idolatry, and ſeduced by falſe Prophets (being Idol-Prieſts, and deluding Witches) were ſo enlightned, that all Idolatrous deluſions were diſcovered, the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and of all Idols, drew dumb, <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer, and all bewitching falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were confounded, and all theſe Inſtruments of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs grew out of requeſt among the people, being clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that they were all Lyars, and uſed lying deluſions to deceive the Nations. And notwithſtanding this perfect rule of righteouſneſs in the Old and New Teſtament, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Prophets before the coming of Chriſt, and at his coming finiſhed by him and his Apoſtles, yet ſuch is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of mans darkſome nature, that men will carry a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of their own in their hands, even at Noon-day, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they can by their own wiſdom finde out truths that are not written in the Scriptures, and that their Candle will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them more than the beams of the Sun when it ſhineth forth in its full ſtrength; Like a ſilly Labourer, that count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day by a Pocket Watch, whoſe Wheels being out of Kilter went too faſt, he had ſuch a conceit of his Watch, that he affirmed, That the Sun in the skie went too ſlow, for his Watch was known to be true.</p>

            <p>We may read of the Prieſts of the Idol <hi>Aſtaroth,</hi> that were indeed real Witches in the Scripture ſenſe, who profeſſed to do ſuch things by the power of their Idol, but were diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Bartholomaeus</hi> the Apoſtle, to be deceivers of the people, by the Devils ſubtil deluſions, who ruled in their hearts, ſo they with their Idol were deſtroyed, and many people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Chriſtian Faith. <hi>Hendorfius</hi> in the fifth page of his Theater of Hiſtory (his words are theſe, <hi>Bartholomaeus Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Aſtaroth evertit, fraudes Satanae qui miraculis homines ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facinatos morbis jam premebat, jam preſſos levabat, detexit. &amp;c.)</hi> And where do we read in Holy Writ (or common Hiſtory that ſaver of truth) that men by Devils could do ſuch things really? and to uphold ſuch errours contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what is this but meer prevarication with the truth, and reſiſting Gods holy Spirit of truth? Where do we finde any ſuch thing in Scriptures, or any ſuch deſcription of a VVitch, or that a VVitch was ſuch a one as hath made a League with the Devil, and ſealed it with his bloud, or hath Imps ſucking him, or Biggs, or privie Marks, or that lyeth with <hi>Incubus,</hi> or <hi>Succubus,</hi> or any ſuch phraſe or expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all the Scriptures? VVhat leaſt inkling have we of theſe things in all the Scriptures? VVhence received the Church of <hi>England</hi> this Doctrin? O fooliſh <hi>England,</hi> who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was the Pope. This groundleſs, impious, and fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctrin was never taught by Gods Prophets, but that VVitch, the Pope, knowing in his Conſcience that he is the very VVitch, the Deceiver of the Nations pointed at in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and that the Scriptures were ſo plain, that by the light thereof his devilliſh deluſions muſt needs come to light, if the VVorld ſhould have true inſight into the Scriptures, and ſo that by that means all Nations would riſe up on him and deſtroy him, he not only laboured to hide the Scriptures from the common people, which he did for a long time, but alſo hath been ſo bold as to prevaricate with the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65492:51"/>
Scriptures, and to publiſh through the Nations, that VVitches were to be underſtood no Deceivers, but ſuch as practiſed ſuch wonderful things, as the Scripture teacheth us that the doing thereof ought to be attributed to no Creature, but only to the Creator, as Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the eighth to the Inquiſitors of <hi>Almain,</hi> and Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, to the Inquiſitors of <hi>Bergoman</hi> ſent thoſe words; It is come to our ears, that many lewd perſons of both kinds, as well male as female, uſing the company of the Devils <hi>Incubus</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubus,</hi> with Incantations, and Conjurations, do deſtroy the birth of VVomen with childe, the young of all Cattel, the Corn of the field, the Grapes of the Vine, the fruit of the Trees, Men and VVomen, and all kinde of Cattel, and beaſts of the field, and with their ſaid Inchantments do whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſh, ſuffocate, and ſpoyl all Vine-yards, Orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, Meadows, Paſtures, Graſs, green Corn, ripe Corn, and all other proviſions, men and women are by their impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations ſo afflicted, with external and inward pains and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, that men cannot beget, nor women bring forth, nor accompliſh the duty of VVedlock, denying the faith which in Baptiſm they profeſs, to the deſtruction of their ſouls; Our pleaſure therefore is, That all inpediments that may hinder the Inquiſitors Office be removed from among the people, leſt this blot of Hereſie proceed to defile them that be yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and therefore we do ordain by vertue of the Apoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal authority, that our Inquiſitors of high <hi>Almain</hi> may exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Office of Inquiſition, by all Tortures, and Afflictions, in all places, and upon all perſons.

about the reaſon of it, and that they may make the matter ſeem true, one quotes anothers authority for it, and <hi>Suarez</hi> quoteth <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> citeth <hi>Hogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Niphodorus,</hi> and <hi>Apollonides</hi> for his Authors, that among the <hi>Triballians,</hi> and <hi>Illyrians,</hi> and <hi>Scythians,</hi> there be certain Women that can kill with their eye-ſight whom they look wiſhfully upon; mark, but how firſt things are reported by Travellers who may lye by authority; then <hi>Pliny</hi> gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their ſeveral reports into the Volume of his Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory (whom all men may ſee was abuſed by being too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous of other mens reports) and yet <hi>Suarez</hi> is forced to uſe <hi>Plinies</hi> Pen to prove that which cannot be proved or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by reaſon, and having no better Argument, he ſaith further, <hi>Sunt qui negant illam vim faſcinationis, ſed non eſt cur experientiam à Philoſophis &amp; medicis comprobatam, &amp; ferè communi ſenſu receptam, negemus;</hi> by which Argument a man may as well prove that Idols were gods, becauſe they were approved in their time by men of all Arts and Sciences, <hi>Et ferè communi ſenſu recepta;</hi> and further (according to <hi>Plinies</hi> report) he ſaith, that theſe women do kill but by ſome poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous quality of their Natural complexion, and inward hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of their bodies, communicated to the vital ſpirits, and by the action of the minde brought to the eye-ſight, and from thence infecting the party whom they look upon, and this (he ſaith expreſly) cometh naturally to paſs, and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred natural cauſes in the Witches bodies; but mark how this fellow (although notable for learning) hath wildered himſelf in ſearching out the reaſon of a meer vain ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and erroneous tradition, that Witches can kill by looks; for whereas he giveth this reaſon, that Witches have inward natural poyſon, whereby they naturally kill others; what an abſurdity is this to ſay, that any Creature can by its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral quality be contrary or deſtructive to its own ſpecies? for a Viper cannot poyſon a Viper, nor a Toad cannot poyſon a Toad; for their nature is one, and not contrary to its own ſpecies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas he reaſoneth, that this poyſon is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from the humours to the vital ſpirits, and by the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65492:53"/>
action of the minde brought to the eye-ſight. It is moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd in Philoſophy; for what Phyſician or Philoſopher doth not acknowledge that the vital ſpirits, once poyſoned, do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focate the Heart, the fountain of Life (as is often ſeen in the Peſtilence) whereby the Witch her ſelf muſt needs periſh; and is alſo often ſeen in thoſe who having but the Natural hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of their own bodies corrupt, the vital ſpirits are debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated, and cannot operate, but the party decayeth and ſoon periſheth, becauſe the heart cannot abide any corrupt poyſon, or contrary temperature to its own nature.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas he ſaith, this poyſon is ſent from the Witch by the force of ſeeing, this alſo is an abſurdity in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; for all ſound Philoſophers do acknowledge, that <hi>Oculus non vidit emittendo vim ſuam videndi ad objectum viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, ſed recipiendo ſpecies viſibiles ab objecto;</hi> how then can the ſight (if it were poyſon) hurt any way the party upon whom it only looketh?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whereas he ſaith, that Witches do kill by their natural complexion and inward humour, being naturally poyſon, what an abſurdity ariſeth from hence in Divinity? To conceive that God ſhould make men and women natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally poyſon, and deſtructive to others, and yet ſhould make a Law that ſuch ſhould be put to death, yea cruel death, for being ſuch as God made them in their nature and complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Surely if man had ſtood in the manner in which he was made, God had not puniſhed him with death. Now after he hath thus intrapped himſelf in his Diſcourſe, by ſeeking out a reaſon of that which is not (but only conceived to be by credulous people) he falleth off from his own weak reaſons, to the reaſon that <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> giveth, and that is, That ſometimes this Faſcination is wrought by a ſecret compact with the Devil; but how can theſe Reaſons accord one with the other? for if it be natural to the Witch to bewitch others, what needeth ſhe then to ſeek help of the Devil to do that which ſhe can do by nature? For, <hi>Deus eſt author Naturae</hi> and ſure the Devil cannot make more perfect or forceable that which God hath made; but ſuch is the nature of all theſe Popiſh Writers, that when they cannot ſtrongly enough
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65492:53"/>
maintain a Lye, they father their Lyes upon their Maſter the Father of Lyes, and are forced, after all their vain argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to uſe his name to uphold a Lye, and (although they were great Scholars) have rather intangled themſelves with folly in reaſoning, and with ſo manifeſt errour (whereby they have expoſed themſelves to the laſh of common Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) than to forſake their Popiſh darkneſs, which they are ingaged to defend. What ſhall not be done to bring the Popes ends to paſs? what Lyes, what fooliſh Fictions, what impoſſibilities can the Heart of man deviſe, that theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether have not affirmed for truth unto the World, to infect the Nations with Hereſie, or Atheiſm, whereby to deſtroy the Chriſtian Church? And for further confirmation of the matter, they have deviſed, among other Tortures, to make people confeſs that they can do ſuch impoſſibilities, one of the moſt devilliſh cruelties that hath been deviſed among men, and that is, to keep the poor accuſed party from ſleep many nights and days, thereby to diſtemper their brains, and hurt their fancies, at length to extort confeſſion from them, and then to bring their own confeſſion as an evidence againſt them; and if they cannot make them confeſs, they torture one of their little Children to make it accuſe their Parents, and that they call confeſſion; this trick will tame any wilde Beaſt, and make it tractable, or any wilde Hawk, and make it tame, and come to your fiſt, how much more may it make men or women yeeld to confeſs Lyes, and impoſſibilities? And if that device will not ſerve, then they ſhave them, and ſearch narrowly all parts of their bodies, where they think modeſt men will not be forward to look, to ſee the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and there they report that they have found the Devils privie Marks, and Biggs, for the Devil to ſuck them; a moſt devilliſh Lye and invention, unleſs they can ſhew me Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it, but I can ſhew them Scripture againſt it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Without God was nothing made that was made;</hi> who then made thoſe Biggs, or Teats, and who made the bodies of thoſe Devils called Imps? Alſo what Scripture ſaith, that Biggs or privie Marks are ſigns or trials of Witches? (yet I deny not but ſometimes are found fleſhy Warts, and other
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65492:54"/>
preter-natural tumours written of by Phyſick Authors, as diſeaſes of the body) and among other devices (as Maſter <hi>Scot</hi> in his diſcovery affirmeth (who was zealous for Gods truth, and took more pains than ordinary to ſearch and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute thoſe impious Writers) they have ſet down certain ſigns whereby to ſuſpect and apprehend Witches, which are theſe;</p>
            <p>Firſt, If they will not faſt on Fridays.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If they faſt on Sundays.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If they ſpettle at the time of Elevation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If they refuſe Holy Water.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If they deſpiſe Croſſes.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, If they deny any of the ſeven Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Theſe are great ſuſpicions that they are Witches; for the Devil (ſay they) chooſeth them by theſe ſigns (being ſteps to the reformed Religion) apprehend them, bring them to the Tormentor; but if they ſee any of theſe ſigns, they will eaſily finde other holes enough in their Coates to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them.</p>
            <p>Then they caſt them into the water, to ſee whether they will ſink or ſwim, a meer Jugling deluſion to blinde peoples eyes, for he that hath been uſed to the Art of Swimming may know, that few men or women being tied hand and feet together can ſink quite away till they be drowned, or if he lay them flat on their back, and hold up their feet with a ſtring, their fore-part will not ſink, and therein they can uſe Jugling to blinde the peoples, eyes for difference ſake; for when they will ſave any man or woman, they will let looſe the ſtring which they hold in their hand, and let their feet ſink firſt, and then all their body will ſink, then they cry out to the people, Look you now, and ſee the difference betwixt an honeſt man or woman, and a Witch, take her out, ſhe is an honeſt woman, yea verily, for ſometimes ſhe is one of their own confederates. Yet whereas ſome may object, that ſome of them that are caſt fairly into the water, without holding up their feet with a ſtring, do ſink more than others, and ſome again do ſwim more than others (although none do ſink quite away without any part appearing above water)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65492:54"/>
The reaſon of this difference is eaſie to conceive to men of knowledge; for,</p>
            <p>Firſt; There is difference of conſtitution in peoples bodies; ſome are heavie of temper, and they ſink moſt; ſome again are more light of temper, fuller of vital ſpirits, and they ſink not ſo much.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt obſerve the Syſtole and Diaſtole of breathing; ſome happen to fall into the water when their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are full of breath, and they ſwim moſt; ſome happen to fall into the water when their breath is out of their bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can draw it up again, and they ſink moſt. Some are kept long faſting in watching and torment, and then are caſt into the water when their bowels and veins are empty of food and filled with Wind, and theſe ſwim more than thoſe that are filled with nouriſhment; or perhaps they are kept faſting ſo long that they have ſcarce any life left, and then they happen to ſink moſt, but if they do, it muſt not ſerve their turn, for the cruel Inquiſitor will ſtill torment them till he extort confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if the party live long enough for his cruelty to take place. Some again are Women caſt into the water, with their Coates tied cloſe toward their feet, and Men with their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel on (and for this they pretend modeſty) but who knoweth not that their apparrel will carry them above water for a time? Some again are Women, whoſe bodies are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with bearing of Children, and do always after remain ſpongiouſly hollow, more apt to ſwim than to ſink, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tied hands and feet together, to bring their bodies into a round and apt faſhion to ſwim. They that are uſed to the Art of ſwimming in the water, might eaſily diſcover theſe to be but Deluſions and Juglings, if they were not too credulous; and yet with theſe hath poor <hi>England</hi> been bewitched and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as alſo with the former, of keeping the accuſed from ſleep till they confeſs; and theſe deluſions have been impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly acted here in <hi>England,</hi> of late in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> by a wicked Inquiſitor pretending authority for it, to the cutting off of fourteen innocent people at <hi>Chelmsford</hi> Aſſizes, and about an hundred at <hi>Berry</hi> Aſſizes, whereof one was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter neer <hi>Fremingham,</hi> of about fourſcore years age, wherein
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65492:55"/>
this Inquiſitor hath laid ſuch a preſident for the Popes Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (if times of Popiſh Tyranny ſhould again come in, from which God in his mercy defend us) as would not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be removed, when although we have no Laws in <hi>England</hi> to try people upon Life and Death by any Inquiſition, or Inquiſitor, in that manner; yet it may then bee ſaid, was it Law then, when the Law was in your hands, and is it not Law now? but if ſuch times of tyrannous Inquiſition come, do they that have had a hand in this preſident think they ſhall eſcape it, or their Poſterity? There is already a preſident for killing of Miniſters for Witches.</p>
            <p>Alſo ſome credulous people hearing of the Condemnation of thoſe people, have publiſhed a Book, wherein they report ſuch impoſſibilities to be done by them, as I hope no wiſe man will beleeve; wherein alſo <hi>Hoy,</hi> the Gaoler, is brought in for a Witneſs, a fellow, that is not fit to bear the Office of a Gaoler, nor any other Office in a Chriſtian Common-wealth, who alſo wanted Vails, and thought the more Priſoners were executed, the more he ſhould gain; and yet it is reported, his Teſtimony was taken as an Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, although his teſtimony was partly of impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, partly meer prevarications and lyes, to the diſ-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Gods Majeſty, and the ſhedding of innocent bloud.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing then this miſerable Maſſacre of people through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Chriſtian World hath been but a trick of Antichriſt, to blinde the World, that thereby he might the more eaſily and quietly deſtroy the Church under the name of Witches, Surely if good Chriſtians have been deſtroyed in this impious way, then thouſands of the Souls of ſuch are now under the Altar, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.9, 10. crying, How long Lord, holy and true, will it be ere thou avenge our bloud upon them that dwell upon the earth? being ſome of them the very people that have been deſtroyed for the Word of God, and for the teſtimony of the truth; and therefore have been brought into theſe murderous Inquiſitors hands; And although it may be ſaid, Theſe in <hi>England</hi> have not been ſlain for the teſtimony of the truth; yet I anſwer, The Church ſtandeth for the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65492:55"/>
teſtimony of the truth, and this perſecution was invented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church, and ſo they as Members of the Church have been ſlain by the enemies invention; for had they been of that Popiſh crew, and fighters againſt the Church, thoſe wrongful accuſations had not been brought againſt them by them. But it may be ſaid, Some of theſe were Scoulds and Brawlers, therefore their Souls are not under the Altar. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, yea, and many honeſt Livers that have been executed in that kinde lately, and in times paſt; but whatſoever they were, if they were unjuſtly ſlain, know, that if God would avenge the bloud of <hi>Cain,</hi> will he not avenge the bloud of theſe?</p>
            <p>Before the deſtruction of <hi>Germany,</hi> that Nation was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by theſe Popiſh errours; that they put to death thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in that kinde, of all ſorts, and that Nation was ſo carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with that darkſome Idolatrous opinion of Witches power, that ſeldom came any thing croſs, but ſome were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to have occaſioned it as Witches, and at laſt God ſent deſtroying Plagues among them, and their hearts were ſo hardened, that they digged the dead out of the Graves to cut off their Heads to ſtay the Plague; ſo blinde were they, and ſo given over, that rather than they would acknowledge Gods hand in all things, they would ſay, the dead in their Graves, by the Devils help, brought the plague; and ſome Phyſicians among them were ſo bold to affirm it for truth, who although they might be ſome way approved in Phyſick, yet beſides their horrible Atheiſm, they ſhewed their ſillineſs, and it may be ſaid of them as of many ignorant Phyſicians, <hi>Inſcitiae pallium maleficium &amp; incantatio;</hi> A Cloak for a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians ignorance, when he cannot finde the reaſon and the nature of the Diſeaſe, he ſaith, the Party is bewitched; this hath indeed been written of by ſome worthy Authors, but how, and in what manner? <hi>Senertus Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de febribus, cap.</hi> 2. he being loath to defile his pen with ſuch an impious opinion, ſaith, <hi>I had rather refer the Reader to the writing of another man,</hi> Hercul. Saxoniae, Lib. de plica. cap. 11. <hi>than bring my ſelf upon the Stage for broaching of ſuch an opinion;</hi> where alſo you may read the words of <hi>Herc. Saxon.</hi> aforeſaid, and hee
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65492:56"/>
ſhuffleth it off to <hi>Joh. Veſino Leopolienſi,</hi> as an Opinion of his, and he like an Atheiſt did indeed own that opinion, That in <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> Witches, after their execution and burial, did commonly ſend deſtroying peſtilence; I think indeed the executing of ſo many innocent poor people did bring the Peſtilence, and the Sword, and Famine, all againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they provoked God with their own inventions, tending not only to Idolatry, in imputing the Work of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to a Creature, but alſo to the ſhedding of innocent bloud.</p>
            <p>Maſter <hi>Scot</hi> in his Diſcovery telleth us, That our <hi>Engliſh</hi> people in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe poſterity were lately barbarouſly cut off, were much given to this Idolatry in the Queens time, inſomuch that there being a Diſeaſe amongſt their Cattel that grew blinde, being a common Diſeaſe in that Country, they did commonly execute people for it, calling them eye-biting Witches; <hi>Great Britain</hi> hath been much infected with that Atheiſm, and many people both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> have been by fooliſh falſe accuſations put to death, for doing ſuch things as are not in the power of men, or of Devils to do, but only of the Creator; And before theſe Wars began, what Atheiſtical reports were publiſhed of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> people, that they could transform themſelves into Grey-hounds, and into Men and Women again, and pull down Butter and other proviſion from the Air, (or from whence any crack-brained accuſer would imagine?)</p>
            <p>When King <hi>Charls</hi> went laſt to <hi>Scotland</hi> before theſe Wars, as he came back again ſayling over the River <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> the Veſſel in which his Plate was carried, was reported to be caſt away, and then was that Atheiſm ſo great, even at the very Court of <hi>England,</hi> that they reported Witches had done it, inſtead of obſerving Gods ſupream Providence, (whereas Chriſt ſaith, <hi>A Sparrow ſhall not fall to the ground without Gods providence)</hi> ſince which we have had bloudy Wars, and where is the Court now? and now of late hath been in the year one thouſand ſix hundred forty five, that great ſlaughter of Men and Women called Witches, at the Aſsizes at <hi>Berry,</hi> and at <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> thoſe poor accuſed people
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65492:56"/>
were watched day and night, and kept from ſleep with much cruelty, till their Fancies being hurt, they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs what their Inquiſitors would have them, although it were a thing impoſsible, and flat contrary to ſenſe and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian underſtanding to beleeve; (where, for the removing of Objections, it is to be noted, That a Fancy ſo hurt with watching, cannot afterward of a long time recant, or deny that which they have confeſſed, no more than a Hawk through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tamed by watching can grow ſpeedily wilde again, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you give them their full ſleep; this manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting confeſsion, and ſeeming to convict them, being but a meer Jugling Trick invented by the Pope, and their Trial in that kinde being Jugling Witchcraft it ſelf, that may make the wiſeſt man confeſs any thing though never ſo falſe) What troubles have followed this Slaughter, blinde men may ſee.</p>
            <p>A little before the Conqueſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> (as is reported up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good intelligence) the Presbytery of <hi>Scotland</hi> did, by their own pretended authority, take upon them to Summon, Convent, Cenſure, and Condemn people to cruel death for Witches and (as is credibly reported) they cauſed four thouſand to be executed by Fire and Halter, and had as many in priſon to be tried by them, when God ſent his conquering Sword to ſuppreſs them, by occaſion of which Wars there were many Miniſters (whereof many were Presbyters) ſlain; What is become of their Presbyterian Authority now? Yet becauſe there are ſome that ſlighting theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations will hardly be beaten from this conceit of Witches power, which they have ſo long beleeved, and will not yet think but that Witches have a familiar ſpirit, by whoſe help they kill, and act ſtrange Wonders; tell me, where is a place in all the Scripture that ſaith ſo? ſhew me in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſuch a word, as <hi>Striges, lamiae, Incubus,</hi> and <hi>Succubus,</hi> or any word of ſuch ſignification or importance; what were <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his Magicians, but deluders of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the People? could they by the help of Satan do any thing truly? were they real Miracles? did not their madneſs come to light? 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9. what ſpirit had the Maid that followed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65492:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Paul?</hi> Act. 16.16. which is ſaid to have the ſpirit of <hi>Python,</hi> was it more than a couſening ſpirit of Divination, for gain? yet ſtill you will ſay, the word <hi>Python</hi> hath been interpreted by many, one that had a familiar ſpirit; imagine they had a familiar ſpirit (although it is but a weak Argument to ground an opinion upon the bare ſignification of a word (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you will have it a ſeducing lying ſpirit, ſuch a one as was in <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets) yet I ſay, anſwer me theſe Four Queſtions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Tell we where a Witch did, or could kill a man in Scripture? What did <hi>Saul</hi> go to the Pythoniſt of <hi>Endor</hi> for? was it that ſhe might help him kill the Philiſtians, or meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Augury or Divination? what did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> call his Witches the Magicians before him for? was it to kill any Man or Beaſt by their cunning? or meerly to work lying Wonders, and diſſemble the Miracles that God wrought by <hi>Moſes?</hi> ſo that they might withſtand <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the truth, and blinde <hi>Pharaohs</hi> eyes, becauſe God would harden his heart; tell me where you finde in all the Scriptures, that a Witch did, or could kill a man by Witchcraft; ſhew me in all the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the condemning of men or women for Murther, that a Murtherer was called a Witch, or a Witch a Murtherer, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. and other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; are there not ſeveral Rules ſet down for the trying of Murther? ſhew me one that intimateth the Witching of Men or Cattel to death?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Shew me in all the Scriptures where Witches are ſpoken of, that a Witch was a ſecret perſon, or unknown to the World, that ſhould need to be tried by blinde circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and preſumptions, and ſuperſtitions, or by privie Marks, or by Teats, or Biggs, by ſinking or ſwimming, or by confeſſions? were not <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Witches called <hi>Praſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giatores &amp; magi,</hi> openly known? did not <hi>Pharaoh</hi> call them together without privie ſearch, or inquiry? did not <hi>Saul</hi> baniſh all the Witches as people openly known, and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Art of Augury, and their ſeveral couſening practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? when <hi>Saul</hi> inquired for a Witch, did not his ſervants preſently tell him there was one at <hi>Endor,</hi> was ſhe not known
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65492:57"/>
without privie ſearch, or prime marks? Did not the Maid in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that was ſaid to have the ſpirit of <hi>Python,</hi> or to be a <hi>Pythoniſt,</hi> follow <hi>Paul,</hi> crying openly, did not <hi>Simon Magus</hi> act his Deluſions openly, to ſeduce the people? as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Eli<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as</hi> the Sorcerer? were not the Witchcrafts of <hi>Jeza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> known to be her deluſions that ſhe wrought by the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> to ſeduce the people? were not the Witchcrafts of <hi>Manaſſes</hi> open actions, that made <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to go aſtray? where then do we read of a Witch by ſuſpicion, or to be tried by preſumptions, or ſuſpicions, or privie marks, or other ſigns that are mans invention? whence came this darkneſs and blinde errour, but from the Pope, that grand Witch that hath bewitched all Nations? we ſearch for Witchcrafts and abominations in a poor womans wooden diſh, and Chriſt telleth us, they are all in a cup of Gold, in the hand of the great Whore, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Shew me in all the Scriptures where Witchcraft went without Idolatry, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.3. and had not a neceſſary dependance on Idolatry, <hi>Nahum</hi> 3.4. Look again, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11. where all ſorts of Witches are ſpoken of, why were they to be cut off and deſtroyed? the reaſon is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly given, verſ. 14. becauſe they defiled the Nations, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them unto Spiritual VVhoredom, and the Nations were deſtroyed for ſeeking, and making inquiry after their Divinations, or South-ſayings, or Oracles, whereas inquiries ought to be to Gods Prophets, verſ. 15. Was not this <hi>Sauls</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, when he ſought to the Witch of <hi>Endor?</hi> 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 10.13, 14. was not this the ſin of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> where he is blamed for uſing Witchcrafts, when he made <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> go aſtray to Idols? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.9. were not the Witchcrafts and VVhoredoms of <hi>Jeſabel</hi> ſet down as two inſeparable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, her Witchcraft being the upholding of the Idol Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> that by Witchcraft ſeduced the people to Idolatry? were not <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians ſeducers of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the people, from God? was not <hi>Simon Magus</hi> the like? but alas, how, and where have thoſe poor ſouls that are commonly hanged for Witches ſeduced the people to Idolatry? who hath been led after them for Divinations, and Southſayings?
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65492:58"/>
many indeed have been led after Southſayers, but they are termed good Witches, and whereas they as Witches ought to dye, many have been put to death by their devilliſh falſe accuſations, and if the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> were now living a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, we ſhould call her a good VVitch, ſo blinde are the times.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Shew me in all the Law of God againſt Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous uncleaneneſs (where <hi>Moſes</hi> writeth of ſeveral kindes of uncleaneneſs, as man with man, man with beaſt, woman with beaſt, and many more) the leaſt intimation of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by <hi>Incubus,</hi> or <hi>Succubus;</hi> what, did <hi>Moſes</hi> forget this?</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe this opinion hath been ſo upheld by reports and imaginations, and by the extorted confeſſion or people that have been condemned in that kinde, and ſometime by the voluntary confeſſion of deſpairing melancholly people that have been troubled in minde, and wiſh rather to dye than to live, although <hi>Volenti mori, non eſt adhibenda fides;</hi> Yet I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to run over theſe ſeveral places of Scripture with me a little, and ſee how this opinion of VVitches power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the Scriptures, yea how flat contrary it is to Gods Word, and the grounds of our Chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>Yet firſt, becauſe ſome men will not underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in any other ſenſe than as their own Expoſitors have done, be it right or wrong; therefore I refer them that will ſeek farther than the Scriptures, to the words, of a general Counſel, which Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> in his Diſcovery hath alleged as followeth, <hi>Concil. Acqui. in decret.</hi> 26. the words of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. It may not be omitted, that certain wicked VVomen fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Satans provocations, being ſeduced by the illuſion of the Devil, beleeve, and profeſs that in the night time they ride abroad with <hi>Diana</hi> the Goddeſs of the Pagans, or elſe with <hi>Herodias,</hi> with an innumerable multitude, upon certain Beaſts, and paſs over many Countries and Nations in the ſilence of the night, and do whatſoever theſe Ladies or Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries command, &amp;c. let all Miniſters therefore in their ſeveral Cures preach to Gods people ſo, as they may know all thoſe things to be falſe, and whoſoever beleeveth that any
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65492:58"/>
Creature can be made by them, or changed into better or worſe, or be any way transformed into any other kinde, or likeneſs, by any but by the Creator himſelf, is aſſuredly an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, and worſe than a Pagan. So much for the words of the Council. Yet here is to be noted, that this great general Council, that thought theſe people beleeved, and confeſſed ſuch things to be true in their apprehenſion, did not then know the inhuman cruelty that was uſed upon thoſe people by the cruel Inquiſitors to compel, and extort confeſsion for their own gain, they being maintained by the ſpoyl of ſuch people being condemned.</p>
            <p>Now for the Scriptures, do but mark how thoſe that maintain, and report the power of VVitches, have equalled their ſupernatural power, with the Miracles of the Prophets, of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles; it was the Miracle of Miracles, that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> conceived with childe without a man; they ſay, a VVitch may do the ſame by <hi>Incubus,</hi> as <hi>Bodin,</hi> and other Popiſh VVriters affirm, and that ſuch a childe will naturally become a VVitch, ſuch a one they ſay <hi>Merlin</hi> was; no, but you ſay theſe were Atheiſts, we beleeve not ſo; But ſome will ſay, the Devil can condenſe a body, and lye carnally with a woman in the ſhape of a man, but not beget; yet it was a Miracle that Angels appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> in the ſhape of men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.2. yet they will ſay no, but we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Devil may aſſume and raiſe a dead body for a time, and ſo appear to a woman, and lye with her; and yet it was a Miracle at the ſuffering of Chriſt upon the Croſs, that dead, bodies were raiſed for a time and appeared to many, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.52. yet a poor VVench was executed at the Aſsizes at <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> who was compelled by the Inquiſitor (by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her from ſleep, and with promiſes and threatnings) to confeſs that ſhe was married to the Devil, and that he lay with her ſix times in a mans ſhape; no, but yet ſome will ſay, the Devil can take upon him an apparent Body, and ſo may talk with a woman, and ſeem to lye with her in ſhape of a man, and ſo ſhe ſhall be hanged for things ſeeming ſo; yet it was a Miracle that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> appeared to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in a Viſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.3. Further, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>A Spirit
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65492:59"/>
hath not fleſh and bones,</hi> Luke 24.39. and yet ſome ſay, the Devil can condenſe a body, ſome ſay he can aſſume a body, ſome ſay he can have an apparent body; thus do they make the Word of God of no validity by their groundleſs traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for if the Devil can have ſo much as an apparent body, what validity was in the words of Chriſt, to take away the doubt of the Diſciples, when they ſuppoſed they ſaw a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Where alſo is that fooliſh Doctrin of Imps, ſucking of men and women Witches become? Are thoſe Imps bodies or ſpirits? if bodies, then who made them? <hi>Without God was nothing made,</hi> Joh. 1.3. if ſpirits, then ſpirits can have bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſhape, and fleſh, and bones; and thus you make the words of Chriſt of none effect by your traditions. Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed Devils to enter into the Herd of Swine, and they went, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.12. they ſay a Witch can do more; ſhe can ſend the Devil into men and women, and children, and cattel, to kill them, and to witch them to death.</p>
            <p>God ſaid to Satan, <hi>All that</hi> Job <hi>hath is in thine hand,</hi> Job 1.12. <hi>and</hi> Job <hi>himſelf, all but his life,</hi> Job 2.6. they ſay, God permitteth a Witch to do more, to ſend Satan to deſtroy a mans goods, and cattel, and children, and life and all; thus they deliver for Doctrin the traditions of men. <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord,</hi> and acknowledged Gods hand in all things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tempted he God fooliſhly; But if one ſhould be ſo afflicted now adays, inſtead of acknowledging Gods ſovereign hand, all the poor Wives and Widows in a Country muſt be called <hi>Coram nobis,</hi> as being accuſed to have done it. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.18. <hi>I have the keys of Hell and Death,</hi> but they ſay, God giveth the keys of Death likewiſe ſometimes to an old Witch (man or woman) and permits them to witch men to death; Chriſt ſaith, <hi>A Sparrow falleth not to the ground without Gods providence,</hi> Matth. 10 29. but they ſay, God layeth his providence ſometimes at the feet of an old Witch, and permitteth her to ſend the Devil to deſtroy men and cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; ſome will ſay, A VVitch cannot hurt a godly man, but only a wicked man, and yet God ſaith, he is the Author of all affliction that cometh to the wicked, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. from the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65492:59"/>
fourteenth verſe to the thirty fourth. Alſo the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Lord killeth and maketh alive,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.6. <hi>maketh poor, and maketh rich;</hi> and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39. <hi>There is no God with me, I kill and give life, I wound and make whole;</hi> but they ſay, God permitteth an old VVitch to ſend the Devil to kill, and make poor, and wound, and a good VVitch can heal again by unwitching.</p>
            <p>God did ſhut up every wombe of the Houſe of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> that they bare no children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.18. they ſay a VVitch can do the ſame (God permits it) and make men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men barren. Chriſt gave his Diſciples power over Devils, to caſt them out, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.1. they ſay, a VVitch can ſend a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil into men and cattel to afflict them, and a good VVitch can caſt them out by unwitching, notwithſtanding, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.25. <hi>Every kingdom divided againſt it ſelf is brought to deſolation;</hi> yet they ſay, that is done by conſent of the Devil, when a good VVitch unwitcheth a man; thus do they make the words of Chriſt of none effect by their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Chriſt came and appeared unto his Diſciples, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed away again inviſible, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.31. they ſay, a VVitch can go inviſible by the help of the Devil, eſpecially if one of the Ladies of the Fairie will but lend her <hi>Giges</hi> inviſible ring. Chriſt was lifted up into the Air, and taken up out of their ſight, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. and <hi>Bodinus</hi> and other Popiſh VVriters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that a VVitch can be lifted away in the Air by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the broth of a ſodden Infant; but poor <hi>Germany,</hi> that beleeved theſe Doctrins, and in that confidence executed many people for VVitches, was compelled afterward to boyl their children to quell their hunger, and found by ſad experience that there was no ſuch vertue in that woful Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. God ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Go up into the mountain and dye, Deut.</hi> 32.49, 50. and he did ſo, Chap. 34. verſ. 5. they ſay a VVitch can do ſo at the word of the Devil, and dye when ſhe liſt, to eſcape hanging; and what is a more common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port when a poor woman is laid in priſon, and there dyeth by grief and hard uſage, than to report, the Devil promiſed her ſhe ſhould not be hanged, and was as good as his word, for ſhe dyed in priſon before the day of Execution came;

thus do they make the Devil able to determine, and limit the life of Man, as God did the life of <hi>Moſes.</hi>

            <p>It is ſaid in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.23. <hi>Shew what is to come after, that we may know yee are gods;</hi> They ſay, a Witch can truly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel things to come by her ſpirit of Divination (which they call a Familiar) and can by the ſame familiar tell what is done in another Town, or Houſe, or Country, and can tell a man where are his Goods that are loſt, as well as <hi>Samuel</hi> could tell <hi>Saul</hi> of his Fathers Aſſes when they were loſt, and ſuch they call good Witches.</p>
            <p>Alſo in the ſame Verſe, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 41.23. it followeth in the end of the verſe, <hi>do good, or do evil, that we may be diſmayed, and behold it together;</hi> theſe words have relation to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words, <hi>That we may know that ye are gods;</hi> that is, ſhew what is to come hereafter, <hi>or do good, or do evil, that we may know ye are gods, and be diſmayed at your doings</hi> (even as when God ſendeth the evil of puniſhment or affliction upon a people, then they are diſmayed at the ſight and apprehenſion of it,) as in <hi>Job</hi> 40.11. And here when we read that God claimeth the doing thereof as his own Prerogative, inferring as much as to ſay, They are gods that can do this, I think that after the reading of this verſe in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> no man ſhould be ſo groſly Idolatrous ſtill, as to aſcribe to a Witch the ſending of any affliction; thoſe words alſo, <hi>Do good, or do evil,</hi> (the whole verſe having relation to the ſeventh verſe) were ſpoken to the Idol Prieſts of the Heathen, who were the Witches mentioned in the Scriptures, and had as great a ſhare in the Devil, as any Witch can have, and yet God chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth them to do either good or evil; and yet when any evil of affliction cometh upon Men or Beaſt, theſe Idolaters will ſtill aſcribe it to a Witch, ſaying ſtill, God permits it. God ſent an evil ſpirit upon <hi>Saul</hi> to vexe him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14. they ſay a Witch can ſend an evil ſpirit upon men or women to vex or torment them; <hi>Eliſha</hi> curſed two and forty chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the name of the Lord, and they were deſtroyed of Bears, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2.24. they ſay a Witch can curſe men and women in the name of the Devil, and Death or ſome other Evil ſhall betide them.</p>

               <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians, though they were themſelves Witches, yet when they ſaw Lice creeping upon Men and Beaſt, they acknowledged the finger of God.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65492:61"/>
the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.28, 31. but alas, how common a thing is it to aſcribe to the Devil and Witches, the works that God telleth us in the holy Scriptures are his own Works, and cannot be done by any other power but by the Spirit of God? me thinks this ſhould ſcare all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate VVitchmongers. I heard a <hi>Suffolk</hi> Miniſter (whoſe habit and garb might ſeem to claim the title of <hi>Rabbi, Rabbi)</hi> affirm, that one of the poor women that was hanged for a VVitch at <hi>Berry</hi> Aſſizes, in the year 1645. did ſend her Imps into the Army, to kill the Parliaments Souldiers, and another ſent her Imps into the Army to kill the Kings Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and another cauſed a mans crop of Corn to fail, and cauſed that Corn which he had to be blaſted, and tipt, or crockt, and this Miniſter did verily affirm that thoſe things were true, for the VVitches (ſaid he) confeſſed thoſe things; but when I came to argue with him, and to tell him that theſe things in the Scripture-ſenſe were Gods Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, he could anſwer nothing, he was not ſo well ſkilled in the Scriptures; but he replied, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Witch to live.</hi> I demanded of him, what was the ſignification of the Hebrew text, or of the Latine tranſlation, and what was meant by a VVitch in that place, he could not tell; thus hath the ſalt of the earth loſt its ſavour; and whereas thoſe ſhould ſeaſon people with wholſome Doctrin, ſome teach Doctrins of Devils, and the inventions of Antichriſt, to defile the Nations.</p>
            <p>And people are now ſo infected with this damnable Hereſie, of aſcribing to the power of VVitches, that ſeldom hath a man the hand of God againſt him in his eſtate, or health of body, or any way, but preſently he cryeth out of ſome poor innocent Neighbour, that he, or ſhe hath bewitched him; for ſaith he, ſuch an old man or woman came lately to my door, and deſired ſome relief, and I denied it, and God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, my heart did riſe againſt her at that time, my mind gave me ſhe looked like a VVitch, and preſently my Child, my VVife, my Self, my Horſe, my Cow, my Sheep, my Sow, my Hogge, my Dogge, my Cat, or ſomewhat was thus and thus handled, in ſuch a ſtrange manner, as I dare ſwear ſhe is a VVitch? or elſe how ſhould thoſe things be, or
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65492:61"/>
come to paſs? ſeldom goeth any man or woman to a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician for cure of any Diſeaſe, but one queſtion they ask the the Phyſician is, Sir, do you not think this Party is in ill handling, or under an ill tongue? or more plainly, Sir, do you not think the party is bewitched? and to this many an ignorant Phyſician will anſwer, Yes verily; the reaſon is, <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantiae pallium maleficium &amp; incantatio,</hi> a cloak for a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians ignorance, when he cannot finde the nature of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, he ſaith, the Party is bewitched. But for all ſuch as go on to defile the people with theſe Doctrins, that not only have no grounds in the Scriptures, but are flat contrary to the light of the Scriptures. I demand of them, at whoſe hands will Chriſt require at the latter day, not only the bloud of the innocent, but alſo the Souls of ſuch as have periſhed by the practice of theſe Atheiſtical and bloud-guilty ways? which are in every point ſo abſurd and phantaſtical, that if many Miniſters can ſay they never did teach any ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin to the people, yet are they guilty, in that they have not preached againſt theſe devilliſh Doctrins, which do make againſt the true worſhip of God, and againſt the life of charity toward our Neighbour, and toward the poor and widows, and lame and aged people.</p>
            <p>Many Objections and evaſions are daily brought againſt this my Diſcourſe, which though they are weak and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, yet would fill whole Volumes if I would ſtand to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The common evaſion of every one when they can prove nothing, nor anſwer, but are fully convinced of their errours by the Scriptures, is, Say no more, we acknowledge that a Witch can do no more than God permits her, or permits him to do, but what God permits, that a Witch can do; this is juſt as when God and his Prophets taught the people ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and late, that they ſhould not aſcribe any power to Idols, as if the people had anſwered the Prophets, Say no more, we know theſe Idols can do no more than God permits them <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o do, but if God permit them to ſave, or deſtroy, they can do it. So when God claimeth it as his own Prerogative, to kill and make alive, make rich and make poor, wound and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65492:62"/>
heal, (and many other things, as I have already proved by Scripture) and will not have his Prerogative aſcribed to any Creature, yet ſtill ye ſay, the Lord permits it, whereas yet yee have no more ground or warrant in the Scripture, that God permits any ſuch power to Witches, than the Heathen had to ſay, the moſt high God permitted their Idols alſo to be gods, and to have power to kill, or to ſave alive.</p>
            <p>Further, Ye ſay, God permits one man to murther ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet for this the murtherer ought to be ſlain; that is true indeed, but for that yee have Scripture, where yee read in the Law, of Murther, how it was to be judged, that is, if one man did wilfully ſmite another with his hand, or any other material inſtrument, that he dyed, it was murther, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.16. and ſo forward, but where do you read that God permits any ſuch thing to come to paſs by a Witch, or that any man can kill another by Witchcraft, or without a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Inſtrument? and when it is proved by many places of Scripture, that many ſuch things as yee aſcribe to Witches are Gods Prerogative, yet ſtill yee cry, God permits it.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Another Objection is this, It is certain that there are ſome people in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Polonia,</hi> that do commonly ſell Winds by the Devils help to Sea-men, to carry their ſhips whither they intend; therefore a Witch can make a League with the Devil, and by his help can raiſe Winds.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, I do not deny but theſe are Witches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they uſe Impoſtures to deceive the world, and ſeduce them to that damnable Idolatry of aſcribing to the Devil and VVitches, and ſeeking to them for that which belongeth to God alone to give, namely VVinds for their Journey; but that they do ſuch things really without deluſion is falſe, which I will firſt prove by Scripture, and then ſhew you the deluſion; for Scripture, firſt I prove, if they can by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils raiſe Winds, then they can alſo ſend fair weather, for the North-wind driveth away rain, as <hi>Job.</hi> 37.22. fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cometh out of the North, and <hi>Job.</hi> 38.24. God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own mighty work ſaith, <hi>By what way is the light parted, which ſcattereth the Eaſt wind upon the earth?</hi> and <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Without God was nothing made,</hi> who then maketh
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65492:62"/>
theſe winds? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. the Winds fulfill the Word of God, or blow at Gods decree. Alſo <hi>Solomon</hi> reckoneth the Winds among ſuch things as keep a natural courſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth the natural courſe thereof, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1.6. Alſo things miraculous can be done by God only, but that was one of the Miracles by which Chriſt ſhewed himſelf to be God, <hi>he made the winds and the ſea obey him,</hi> Mark 4.41. Alſo it is an abſurdity in Philoſophy, to ſay that a Witch, or the Devil, can cauſe Winds, for Winds are exhalations drawn from the Earth, by the influence of the Sun and the Stars, and driven back by the coldneſs of the middle region of the Air, which cauſeth their ſeveral motions, and therefore he that ſaith a Witch or a Devil can cauſe Winds, muſt aſcribe alſo to them that they can rule the Stars, and diſpoſe the quality of the middle Region, by which it muſt follow that they can ſend what weather they liſt, and ſo by conſequence cauſe the earth to bring forth, or to be barren, which were the height of Idolatry to beleeve. And now to come to the impoſture it ſelf, wherewith the foreſaid Impoſtors do deceive fools, making them beleeve they ſell them VVinds for their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The poor Mariner who deſireth to haſten his Journey homewards (but withall conſidereth not that all men muſt wait upon Providence) ſaith, I would give five pounds the VVinds would riſe, or that they would turn fit for our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and being among ſtrangers he is preſently over-heard by ſome of the Factors of thoſe Impoſtors, who preſently take occaſion to tell him, that they will undertake for half the money, to carry him to one that ſhall help him to a VVind according to his minde, then by degrees they draw him on till they bring him into the company of more of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, who do ſo cunningly combine to obſcure his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect by diſcourſe, that at the laſt they lead him (like poor <hi>Saul,</hi> when the Spirit of God had forſaken him) to ſeek to a VVitch, then do they lead him to the Impoſtor, who being ſome skilful Aſtrologian in thoſe Countries, can give a neer gueſs by the Stars, when ſuch a VVind will ariſe, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly prefixeth a day, ſaying, a week hence, or two days hence, or ſometimes a fortnight hence you ſhall have a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65492:63"/>
VVind, in which promiſe it often happeneth that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor himſelf is deceived, when his Prognoſticks fail him; and then they prefixe another day, and do ſtrongly perſwade the ſilly man to ſtay till then, whereas they know till the VVinds riſe he cannot but ſtay, and I my ſelf have talked with Seamen, who confeſs that ſometimes they have been driven to ſtay a week, ſometimes longer, after the day prefixed, and after they parted with their money; but if it happeneth that ſome man after he hath laid out his money upon thoſe Impoſtors, hath ſpeedily a VVind for his Journey; then he rejoyceth, and then the Impoſtors are credited; then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth from the Impoſtor a bottom of Thread which the Impoſtor ſaith he had from ſuch an old VVoman (becauſe he will not ſeem to be the VVitch himſelf) and this Thread is to be carried by the Mariner, or by the Merchant, into the Ship, and he muſt by degrees continually unwinde the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Thread, ſo long as he would have that VVind blow; but if all things happen well, then it is concluded, ſurely it is by vertue of the Thread; but if VVinds prove by the way croſs, then it is the fault of him that unwindeth the bottome too faſt, or too ſlow, or with the wrong hand; and thus are poor Idolatrous fools cheated by them that make a rich trade of their Impoſture. I deny not but this deluſion is variouſly acted in ſeveral Countries, and ſome Travellours report ſome one way, and ſome another way of the manner, and carriage of the Impoſture; but he that beleeveth that it is really done, and not a deceiving impoſture, is an Idolater, and as bad as an Infidel, and for ſuch Mariners as will buy Winds in that manner, the Mariners of <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt them, who when they ſaw the Wind riſe, and the Sea tempeſtuous, and againſt their Voyage, they fought for whoſe ſin that evil was come upon them, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.7. thoſe poor Heathen knew that Winds and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts came not from a Witch, but from the hand of God. To conclude, ſtories reported by Travellours prove nothing, neither are they lawful Objections, and when we hear ſuch a thing reported contrary to the Scriptures, and to human capacity, it muſt needs follow that it is a deluding impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65492:63"/>
although the ſtory be true from him that reporteth it; and ſome Travellours that report this thing, yet are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in themſelves that it is but deceit. And whereas ſome would confirm this Objection by Scripture, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.19. after God had ſaid to Satan, <hi>All that</hi> Job <hi>hath is in thy power, there came a ſtrong Wind from the Wilderneſs, and ſmote the houſe that it fell upon the young men that they dyed.</hi> Hence they argue, that the Devil raiſed that wind; but this is a falſe concluſion, for then they may as well argue that the Devil ſent the fire from Heaven, as in verſ. 16. which is yet called the fire of God; and <hi>Job</hi> himſelf aſcribed all to God only, verſ. 21.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If the Devil had by Gods peculiar diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on raiſed that Wind, God permitting him to afflict <hi>Job,</hi> yet it doth not follow that he can do it at the command of a Witch.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Some to prove the power of Witches to afflict men, and women, and cattel, and to bring to paſs ſtrange things, do alledge <hi>Job</hi> 2.7. yet there is not a Witch mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all the Hiſtory of <hi>Job,</hi> but how abſurdly they do ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue let wiſe men judge; becauſe God ſent Satan to afflict <hi>Job,</hi> therefore a Witch can ſend him to afflict man. God permitteth it, ſay they, by which Argument they ſtill labour to maintain that God lendeth his Prerogatives to a Witch. What though God hath power over Satan, to command him to execute his Will, to torment and afflict the wicked for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, to afflict the righteous ſometime for trial? doth it therefore follow that a Witch can do it, becauſe God did it? and where do we read in Scripture that God permits it? and if God ſhould permit it, where do we read that a Witch hath any ſuch power or command over the Devil, or any ſuch league or covenant with the Devil? or that God permits the Devil to be at the command of a Witch?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Some will allege, the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> and yet we never read that the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> could hurt, or ſend the Devil to hurt any man or woman, or childe, or cattel, or raiſe Winds, or the like; neither did <hi>Saul</hi> go to her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire her to kill the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> but he went for Divinations,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65492:64"/>
to know what ſhould become of the Battel the next day. And what Objections ſoever any man ſhall bring from the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> they themſelves may anſwer, if they read but the Seventh deſcription of a Witch, in the firſt Book of this Treatiſe, and he that was bewitched by the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> was <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſuch as ſought to her as <hi>Saul</hi> did, becauſe they were deluded by her.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Some will allege, and object, That the Serpent tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> and from thence they will argue, that the Devil can aſſume the bodies of Creatures, and appear in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſhape, and make a league with a Witch, and execute her will to kill and afflict people and cattel; but this is a poor conſequence, that becauſe he can tempt, therefore he can kill at the command of a Witch; and whereas they would prove from hence, that the Devil can aſſume a bodily ſhape, and appear to a Witch, if they bring that Argument from the literal ſence of the Hiſtory, they muſt ſearch narrowly to prove the Devil was in the Serpent; for it is ſaid, <hi>The Serpent was more ſubtile than any beaſt of the field,</hi> inferring that the Serpent did tempt by its own natural ſubtilty, or elſe why was that expreſſion of the ſubtilty thereof uſed by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</hi> and hence they muſt conclude, that it was the Serpent, and not the Devil, which tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> which were an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd concluſion; and yet if they run upon the letter of the Story, they cannot deny that concluſion to follow, for there is not any mention of the Devil in all the Hiſtory; but if they could prove thence that the Devil did aſſume the body of the Serpent, it maketh nothing to the purpoſe, to prove Witches power to kill, for the Devil did only beguile <hi>Eve,</hi> and not kill her.</p>
            <p>And although it hath been a common expoſition of that place, that the Devil did enter into the body of the Serpent, and ſo appeared unto <hi>Eve</hi> in a bodily ſhape, and talked with her, and tempted her to eat the forbidden Fruit, yet if this expoſition be well and wiſely conſidered, it is moſt groſs and erroneous; for Firſt, here ariſeth an abſurdily, according to their own fond tenents, for then they muſt conclude that <hi>Eve</hi> was a Witch, for ſay they, whoſoever hath had any
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65492:64"/>
familiar diſcourſe with the Devil is in ſome degree a Witch, and ought not to be truſted, although ſhe hath made no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with the Devil, and I have known ſome hanged in my time for that confeſſion, although they did abſolutely deny that ever they made compact with him, or did any mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him; but yet to ſpeak the truth, if it were ſo, that any man or woman could have familiar diſcourſe with the Devil, this maketh not a Witch, for Chriſt himſelf was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by the Devil, and anſwered his tentations by <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt,</hi> Matth. 4. yea, I may further ſay, if any man could enter into an explicite covenant with the Devil to kill by his help, this indeed would make him a Murtherer, but not a Witch in the Scripture ſenſe, although indeed no man can prove by Scripture any ſuch compact at all, or if there could be ſuch a compact made with the Devil, yet that God would ever permit the Devil to perform his covenant with a man, to kill or hurt at his command, cannot be proved. So much by the way.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There ariſeth another abſurdity directly from that expoſition, that the Devil did enter into the body of the Serpent, and ſo tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> for thence it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Devil can open the mouth of a Serpent, and cauſe it to ſpeak, and talk, and ſo that the Devil ſhould have power to work a Miracle, equal with that great Miracle that was wrought by the mighty power of God, when he opened the mouth of <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe, and cauſed him to ſpeak to <hi>Balaam,</hi> which thing were moſt outragious Blaſphemy to affirm; we muſt needs conclude then, that it was neither the Serpent that by its own natural ſubtilty tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> as the letter of the Story importeth, nor the Devil abuſing the body of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; But whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> was here to teach the people a great myſtical Doctrin concerning the fall of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by ſin, unto which ſin man was drawn by the temptations and allurements of the Devil; <hi>Moſes</hi> knowing that the capacity of weak people is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally eſtranged from Spiritual matters, and if he ſhould have taught in plain terms that the Devil tempted man to fall, they would not have underſtood his Doctrin, becauſe they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65492:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knew not what the Devil was, therefore he, by the Spirit of God guiding him, taught the people in a Parabolical way, in which Parable when he ſpeaketh of the Serpent, and of his ſubtilty, he expreſſeth the ſubtilty and malice of the Devil that tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> and all Mankind to diſobedience againſt God, and this Parable he followeth Allegorically, when he ſaith, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto the Serpent, upon thy belly ſhalt thou go, and duſt ſhalt thou eat all the days of thy life;</hi> whereas if we deny this to be a Parable, we muſt hold that the Serpent before that time had leggs, and did not creep up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his belly, and alſo that the Serpent ſinned, and is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for ſin; and yet if the Devil had power to abuſe the body of the Serpent, the Serpent was compelled to do that which they ſay he did; but for thoſe that will take the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures every where in a literal ſence, they muſt alſo hold that the Trees of the Feild did ſpeak, where it is ſaid in a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>The trees ſaid to the Olive-tree, be thou King over us, Judg.</hi> 9.8. But yet if they will not be beaten off from this, that the Devil can aſſume a bodily ſhape, it maketh nothing to prove that Witches are ſuch people as can kill by Witchcraft, or ſend the Devil to kill, for there is no ſuch expreſſion of a VVitch in all the Scriptures, but only that a Witch is ſuch a one as laboureth by Diabolical craft to ſeduce the people from God, and his Truth, to Idolatry, and beleeving of lyes.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Some will object, and ſay, <hi>It is manifeſt that the Devil can help a Witch to fly in the Air, and be tranſported whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe liſteth, or elſe how had the Devil power to carry Chriſt, and ſet him upon the pinacle of the Temple?</hi> Matth. 4. <hi>and</hi> Luke 4.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, This indeed ſeemeth to be a ſtrong Argument, if we take the Scriptures at the ſecond hand, as they are tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but if we ſearch the original mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Greek text (as it was written by the Spirit of God) we ſhall finde there is no ſtrength at all in that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for St. <hi>Luke,</hi> 4.5. ſaith only, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>quem ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duxiſſet eum,</hi> or <hi>ſubducens eum,</hi> and in the ninth verſe is the fame ſenſe, and ſo tranſlated by <hi>Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65492:65"/>
no otherwiſe to be underſtood, but that he was led by the Devil from place to place to be tempted (not that the Devil had power to lead him againſt his will) but being full of the Holy Ghoſt, did by his own Divine counſel yeeld ſo farre to the Devil, as to be led into temptation, that ſo he might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come temptation; and whereas St. <hi>Matthew</hi> uſeth another phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>aſſumpſit eum Diabolus,</hi> verſ. 5.8. this ſoundeth indeed (eſpecially in ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſlations) as if the Devil had tranſported him in the Air from place to place, but it was nothing ſo; if we compare <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> together, and this phraſe uſed by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tremellius,</hi> is by a Metalepſis, ſo that it is plain this Objection is of no force, for Chriſt walked up to the Mountain, and likewiſe walked up the ſtayers of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and leaned upon, and looked over the Battlements of the Temple, which went round about the Temple to keep men from falling, of which we read, ſaith <hi>Beza,</hi> Deut. 22.8. which we falſly tranſlate, Pinacles, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and hee ſet him againſt the Battlements of the Temple.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Another Objection ariſeth from this Diſcourſe, and that is this; <hi>It ſeemeth the Devil can ſome way talk and diſcourſe with a Witch, and therefore can make a League and Covenant with her: for he talked and diſcourſed with Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, how much more eaſily can he talk with a ſinfull man or woman?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, In the ſame manner that he talked with Chriſt, he talketh with every man and woman; he ſaith to a Thief, <hi>Steal;</hi> to a Cut-purſe, <hi>Cut a Purſe;</hi> to a Drunkard, <hi>Drink off your liquor;</hi> to a Murtherer, <hi>Kill ſuch a man,</hi> and theſe obey him; he ſaith to a righteous man, <hi>Steal,</hi> and he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, <hi>It is written thou ſhalt not ſteal;</hi> the Devil ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Go and lye with ſuch a Whore;</hi> he anſwereth, <hi>It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, thou ſhalt not commit Adultery,</hi> and ſo likewiſe for all the Commandements; neither is it to be underſtood other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the temptations wherewith Chriſt was tempted; as if the Devil could utter a human voyce without a tongue, or any organ of ſpeaking, that were an abſurdity in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65492:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for <hi>Natura nihil fecit fruſtra;</hi> and this were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous in Nature for a man to have a Tongue, and other Organs of ſpeaking, if a verbal ſpeaking could be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; and whereas it is written, that the Devil ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt this and that, it was only a mental diſcourſe between Chriſt and the Devil, and is expreſſed in Scripture, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Human capacity by a <hi>proſopopoia,</hi> a Figure very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Scripture, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.8. <hi>Micha</hi> 6.12. there the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by this Figure bringeth in Hills and Flouds acting as a man; and ſo in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. <hi>Luke</hi> 4. the Devil tempting of Chriſt is introduced in the ſtory, as ſpeaking like a man, this is uſed ſometimes in Parables, as in <hi>Job,</hi> from the ſeventh verſe of the firſt Chapter to the twelfth, alſo Chap. 2. the ſix firſt verſes; and in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.21. in theſe and many places by this Figure, ſpeaking and diſcourſing verbally, an Human action is aſcribed to ſuch as it doth not properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; ſo that it appeareth to thoſe that rightly underſtand, that this objection alſo is of no force; but yet ſtill for thoſe that are obſtinate, I ſay, let them prove a League or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by the Scriptures, between the Devil and a Witch, or that the Devil hath power, or permiſſion to perform ſuch a Covenant if made.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Some again will object and ſay, <hi>If Witches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not kill, and do many ſtrange things by Witchcraft, why have many confeſſed that they have done ſuch Murthers, and other ſtrange matters, whereof they have been accuſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, If <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in their innocency were ſo eaſily overcome, and tempted to ſin, how much more may poor Creatures now after the Fall, by perſwaſions, promiſes, and threatnings, by keeping from ſleep, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual torture, be brought to confeſs that which is falſe and impoſſible, and contrary to the faith of a Chriſtian to beleeve?</p>
            <p>Some indeed have in a melancholly diſtraction of minde confeſſed voluntarily, yea and accuſed themſelves to bee Witches, that could do, and had done ſuch ſtrange things, and wonders by the help of the Devil; but mark well their diſtemper, and you ſhall finde that they are deeply gone by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65492:66"/>
infirmity of body affecting the minde, whereby they conceit ſuch things as never were, or can be, as is often proved by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience among Phyſicians, many of thoſe dying in a very ſhort time, (although they be not put to death) except they be cured by the Phyſician; and truly if ſuch Doctrins had not been taught to ſuch people formerly, their melancholly diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers had not had any ſuch objects to work upon, but who ſhall at laſt anſwer for their confeſſion, but they that have infected the mindes of common people with ſuch devilliſh doctrins, whereby ſome are inſtigated to accuſe their poor Neighbours of impoſſibilities contrary to the Scriptures, and ſome drawn to confeſs lyes, and impoſſibilities contrary to Chriſtian light?</p>
            <p>And indeed vain and fickle are the mindes of ſuch diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who do firſt of all father their vain opinions upon the Scriptures, pretending that they are undoubted truths grounded upon the Scriptures, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Witch to live;</hi> but being ſhewed their errours, how they wreſt the Scriptures, will rather forſake the Scriptures, which are the rule of righteouſneſs, then forſake their Opinions, and will beleeve confeſſion againſt the Scriptures. Some men will yet yeeld thus farre, that theſe Confeſſions of poor accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people do many times extend to impoſſibilities, and that they verily beleeve that the Devil deludeth theſe people, making them beleeve that he bringeth to paſs ſuch things as they require him to do, which yet would come to paſs by Divine providence. Some again do ſo Idolize the Devil, as that they affirm that theſe things are real, and do withall cry out, <hi>Great is the power of the Devil;</hi> and yet for any of theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions can produce no Scriptures to prove them, but only Confeſſions; and although thoſe Confeſſions are ſometimes extorted, ſometimes voluntary in poor melancholy, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted people; ſometimes in wicked people, who delight to make the world wonder at lyes, or impoſsibilities, though it be to their own confuſion (they being given over by God, and ſo the Devil ſeeing his opportunity, inſtigateth them to be his Inſtruments to uphold all lying Diabolical Doctrins, ſo that no true beleeving Chriſtian but may diſcern that all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65492:67"/>
theſe Confeſsions are from the Devil, the Father of lyes) yet I ſay, Suppoſe with theſe Confeſsion-mongers, that theſe Confeſſors are deluded by Satan, to think they do ſuch things by the help of the Devil, yet where do we read in Scripture that ſuch are Witches who are deluded by Satan, or that ſuch ſhould be ſlain, or put to death? we read indeed, that Witches were all ſorts of deluding falſe Prophets, but not ſuch as were deluded by Satan.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If you will ſtill affirm, that their Confeſsions are real truths, and not deluſions, but that they do indeed bid the Devil do ſuch things, which (as yee ſay) he doth; yet how can yee prove it by Scripture? where is any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a Witch in the Scripture? but ſurely it is moſt horrible devilliſh forſaking of the Scriptures, to beleeve that there is any truth at all in theſe Confeſsions, and ſuch people as are thus ſeduced by Satan to lying Confeſsion, ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be taught better knowledge, than to be ſlain in their ignorance, and periſh altogether for lack of knowledge; but it is, and hath been the manner of theſe latter Ages, for a Miniſter to go to ſuch, and inſtead of inſtructing them, whereby they might become inſtruments of ſaving their ſouls, they urge them to lying Confeſsions, and ſo do as much as they can to ſend the ſpirit of errour into them to their confuſion, yea and for the moſt part, theſe men who uphold their errours by the Confeſsions of theſe poor accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people, do altogether miſ-interpret their Confeſsions for the upholding of ſuch lyes, for the broaching whereof they have formerly miſ-interpreted and belyed the Scriptures; for let but any man that is wiſe, and free from prejudice, go and hear but the Confeſsions which are ſo commonly alleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he may ſee with what catching, and cavelling, what thwarting and lying, what flat and plain Knavery theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsions are wrung from poor innocent people, and what monſtrous additions and multiplications are afterward inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make the matter ſeem true, which yet is moſt dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably falſe, and flat againſt Chriſtian light, and human rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to beleeve. And for ſuch as can hardly beleeve that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, or diſtemper of body, and troubled phantaſie, can
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65492:67"/>
cauſe people to imagine things ſo really, as to confeſs them to their own deſtruction, though moſt falſe and impoſsible; let them but conſider the late example of a grave Miniſter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> who by a troubled phantaſie was ſo delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (or rather did ſo delude himſelf by weakneſs of Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie and imagination) as he reported that an Angel told him, that the Judgement Day ſhould be upon the next Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; by which report many of the Inhabitants were much troubled till the day was over; if then a grave Miniſter may be miſ-led by Phantaſie, and diſtempered minde; how much more plain common people, who have ſuch Accuſations brought againſt them as are ſufficient to break their brains? Further I ſay, that if the man of ſin ſpoken of in the ſecond to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> chap. 2. had not broached theſe errours to the world, theſe Confeſſors had had no ſuch lying imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to confeſs, for their Confeſsions are not from themſelves, but from the Devil, that ſo he might delude them that love not the truth, but do urge, and ſeek ſuch Confeſsions againſt the truth, as it is ſaid in the eleventh verſe, <hi>For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould beleeve a lye, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ninthly, Some will object, and ſay, They have helped ſearch, and have found Biggs, and privie Marks upon ſuch as have been accuſed to be Witches; but I demand of them, Where doth the Scriptures teach us that a Witch is known by Biggs, or privie Marks? I alſo anſwer, That very few people in the World are without privie Marks upon their bodies, as Moles or ſtains, even ſuch as Witchmongers call <hi>The Devils privie Marks;</hi> which Marks Aſtrologians, do affirm to be the characters of the Stars, variouſly fixed upon men according to their Nativity, and many an honeſt man or woman have ſuch excreſcences growing upon their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as theſe Witchmongers do call, <hi>the Devils Biggs;</hi> as for example; There is a Diſeaſe often found in men or women in the ſeat of people, called Hemorroids, or Piles, or the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Hemorroids veins, a Diſeaſe well known to Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, many times ſwelling forth in the ſeat of people that are ful of Melancholy bloud, and are often found in faſhion like
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65492:68"/>
Biggs, and ſometimes iſſuing forth bloud, and for this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe many have been accuſed by ignorant people, and put to death for Witches; this was part of the Evidence that was brought againſt Matter <hi>Lewis</hi> a Miniſter, executed at <hi>Berry,</hi> in the year 1645.</p>
            <p>There are alſo found often times Excreſcences upon the Bodies of men and women, called <hi>Verrucae penſiles</hi> by the Phyſicians, as we may read in <hi>Leonartus Fuchſius,</hi> in the third Book of his <hi>Inſtitutions of Phyſick,</hi> chap. 26. where he reckoneth up the ſeveral preter-natural tumors of mens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; theſe are a certain kind of long fleſhie Warts, in faſhion of Biggs, or Teats, and do grow commonly on honeſt people, or any ſort of people, and upon Beaſts, and yet for theſe Excreſcences being but outward tumors of the Body, many innocent people have been condemned and executed.</p>
            <p>Another Tumor is found by the Phyſicians, called <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion</hi> both in Greek and Latine, riſing on ſeveral parts of the body like Biggs, or Teats, theſe and other kindes of preter-natural Tumors, of which we may read in Phyſick Authors, which ſometimes being fell, and full of pain by reaſon of the rankneſs of bloud that feedeth them, and therefore iſſuing forth bloud, are called of ignorant Witchmongers, <hi>Devils Biggs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be alſo ſome Natural parts of the Body called by a general name <hi>Glandulae,</hi> and by a particular name <hi>Tonſillae,</hi> in the jaws of people, and in ſome people do plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear under the Tongue like little Biggs, which ſome ignorant Witchmongers having found in people, have taken them as a great evidence againſt poor innocent people, and for theſe have many been executed; but let any wiſe man conſider, what body, of whatſoever conſtitution, eſpecially of poor people that commonly want food, can ſpare a daily exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bloud to nouriſh Imps ſucking them, without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting and over-throwing of their own Natural lives? whereas few poor or old people, but through want of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and weakneſs of nature, have rather want of bloud, than an overpluſs of bloud.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:65492:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>There be alſo often found in Women with Childe, and in Women that do Nurſe children with their Breaſts, and in Women that by any accidental cauſe do want their men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruous courſes, certain ſpots black and blew, as if they were pinched or beaten, which ſome common ignorant people call Fairy-nips, which notwithſtanding do come from the cauſes aforeſaid; and yet for theſe have many ignorant Searchers given Evidence againſt poor innocent people.</p>
            <p>But if any man will yet further cavil againſt Philoſophy, and Phyſick Rules, then let him ſhew me any ſuch deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Witch in all the Scriptures, as Biggs, or Teats, or privie Marks, or Imps ſucking them, or kept by them; and further I ſay, that for any kinde of Biggs, or any things like Biggs, more than hath been found by Phyſicians to be preter-natural Tumors, or Diſeaſes of the Body, or elſe Natural parts, to beleeve, is folly and madneſs, and to affirm, is a phantaſtick Lye, invented by the Devil, and the Pope.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Some men will Object, and ſay, <hi>If Witches have not power to afflict, and torment, and kill People and Cattel, how cometh it to paſs that after the angring of ſuch an old man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or ſuch a lame man, or woman, that came to my Houſe and deſired relief, and I rated her away, and gave her no relief, or did not give her that which ſhe deſired; ſuch and ſuch croſſes and loſſes came upon me, or ſuch a Childe was taken in ſuch a manner, with ſuch a Sickneſs, preſently after, or within few days after his or her coming to my door?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, They that make this Objection muſt dwell very remote from Neighbours, or elſe muſt be known to give very little, or no relief to the poor, if it can be ſaid at any time when a croſs cometh upon them, that one poor bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or other hath not been at their door that day, or not many days before, let it happen at any time whatſoever; ſhall this then be laid to the charge of him, or her that came laſt begging to their door? then by that reaſon no man in <hi>England</hi> can at any time be afflicted but he muſt accuſe ſome poor body or other to have bewitched him; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The poor ye ſhall have always;</hi> and I think no man of ability is long free from poor coming to his door.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:65492:69"/>Secondly, I anſwer, God hath given it as a ſtrict Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to all men to relieve the poor, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.35. and in the next Chapter it followeth, verſ. 14, 15. <hi>Whoſoever heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to all the Commandements of the Lord to do them,</hi> (whereof relieving the poor is one) <hi>the Lord will ſend ſeveral croſſes and afflictions, and diſeaſes upon them,</hi> as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in the Chapter, and therefore men ſhould look into the Scriptures, and ſearch what ſins bring afflictions from Gods hand, and not ſay preſently, what old man or woman was laſt at my door, that I may hang him or her for a Witch; yea we ſhould rather ſay, Becauſe I did not relieve ſuch a poor body that was lately at my door, but gave him harſh and bitter words, therefore God hath laid this affliction upon me, for God ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.23.24. <hi>If thou any way afflict wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and fatherleſs, and they at all cry unto me, I will ſurely hear their cry, and my wrath ſhall wax hot againſt thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, as <hi>Aeſop</hi> ſaith in a Fable, <hi>Volunt homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ut plurimum quando ſuâ culpâ aliquid ſibi acciderit adverſi, in fortunam vel daemonem culpam conferre, ut ſe crimine exuant;</hi> and in his Moral he ſaith, <hi>Homines minime veniâ digni ſunt qui cum liberè peccent fortunam vel doemonem accuſant.</hi> So may I ſay of the moſt part of the World, who if by their own folly and negligence they wrong themſelves, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or their Cattel, they then accuſe their Neighbour of Witchcraft, or if by their ſins they bring down Gods Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they then ſay they are bewitched, aſcribing all to the Devil and Witches, never beholding Gods hand, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that God is juſt, and themſelves ſinners.</p>
            <p>Eleventhly, Some wil ſtill object and ſay, <hi>What though there be no murthering, nor afflicting Witch mentioned in the Scripture, nor any command given to put Witches to death for Murthers, may not this common opinion of all men go for current, unleſs we can prove it by Scriptures? what ſhall one or two mens opinions be preferred before the common tenent of all men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, It was the common tenent of all the Heathen, that Idols were gods, and ought to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; it was the common opinion of all the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65492:69"/>
that it was a ſin to eat with unwaſhen hands, and yet the Scripture telleth us that theſe things were falſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly I anſwer, God gave his Laws, that we ſhould add nothing to them nor take any thing from them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. why then ſhould any man be ſo bold, contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, to make it a Law to put poor people to death, upon fooliſh and feigned ſuppoſitions, or by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tenent, and general blinde opinion of people without ground in the Scriptures?</p>
            <p>Twelfthly, Some will yet object and ſay, <hi>If we may not conclude Murthers and trials of Witches from Biggs and privie Marks, and ſinking, and ſwimming in the water, becauſe we have no warrant or mention of ſuch trials in the Scriptures, then by the ſame conſequence we may not try a Murtherer by any trial but ſuch as is mentioned in the Scriptures; but this is taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that if a murthered man bleedeth new and freſh, when the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer is near the dead Carcaſe, it diſcovereth the Murtherer, and many Murtherers have been diſcovered by Gods providence in that manner, and have confeſſed the Murther, and yet there is no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for this trial of a Murtherer in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this ſubtile Argument I anſwer, That a Judge may be too preſumptuous in condemning a man upon any ſuch evidence as that is; for a dead body will for the moſt part bleed freſh and new, if it lyeth two or three days unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; as it is often ſeen in thoſe that dye a natural death upon their Bed, and not Murthered, the bloud doth many times iſſue out of their mouthes in great abundance, at ſuch times as the Humours of the body begin to putrifie; and by the ſame reaſon a murthered Body will, when it hath lain two or three days, iſſue forth bloud, both at the mouth, and at the wound, whether the Murtherer be preſent or not. And what if God by his providence hath ſo brought it to paſs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that the murthered body hath bled when the Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hath been preſent, and ſo at the ſight of the bloud the Murtherers Conſcience hath ſo accuſed him that he hath been driven to confeſs the Murther? we may not thence conclude, or argue, that this is a certain trial of a Murtherer, without his own Confeſſion, or other manifeſt proofs, for by that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65492:70"/>
means we may ſometimes condemn a guiltleſs man that ſtandeth by at the ſame time of iſſuing forth bloud from the dead body, which is a common and a natural thing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I anſwer this ſubtile Objection thus, Murther by the hand is a certain thing, we know it by experience, and alſo the Scripture ſpeaketh of it, and for the trial and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Murther, when we finde a man murthered, wee have an ordinance in the Scriptures, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. the ſeven firſt verſes, They were to make diligent inquiſition according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in the ſeventh verſe every man ought to clear himſelf that his hand hath not ſhed the bloud of him that was ſlain; and if God bleſſeth his own ordinance of making ſuch ſtrict ſearch and inquiry, by this wonderful and miraculous kinde of bleeding (as you ſuppoſe it to be) yet there is the ground of it, it is his own ordinance, and therefore God bleſſeth it, and diſcovereth the Murther; But now to apply this to a Witch, there is no conſequence at all, for when we finde a man dead, or when any party is diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, we have not any ordinance in the Scripture to make ſearch who hath bewitched ſuch a man, or killed ſuch a man by Witchcraft, but whoſe hand hath ſlain him. As alſo in <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.16. who hath ſmitten him with an inſtrument of Iron, or any material inſtrument, or hand-weapon; wee may not then expect that God ſhould anſwer mens fancies, and vain imaginations of Murthering by Witchcraft, that have no ordinance in Scripture, as he doth his own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and for ſinking, and ſwimming, Biggs and privie Marks, that may as well happen to one man as to another, to make them ſigns and trials of Witches, or Murtherers, is a groundleſs thing, and indeed at firſt invented by the Popes Inquiſitors, who rather than they would not inſnare whom they aimed at to put them to death, they would make any thing a ſign or token of a Witch; and if all theſe ſigns that theſe Popiſh tyrants have affirmed to be ſigns, were as they ſay, true ſigns of Witches, then all people under the Heavens might be by one ſign or other proved to be Witches; theſe ſigns may as well ſignifie a Thief, or a Cut-purſe, as a Witch, being indeed no ſigns at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:65492:70"/>Thirteenthly, Some will object and ſay, <hi>If we may not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that Witches can kill, or afflict people by Witchcraft, except we have ground and warrant for it in the Scriptures, then by the ſame reaſon we may not hang a Thief for Felony, for by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he ought to have reſtored four-fold, and we finde no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Scripture to put him to death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this it is anſwered, to put a Thief to death for Theft; is either lawful, or unlawful; if it be not lawful by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though a thing commonly done, then we may not prove any thing lawful by inſtancing in a thing unlawful.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If it be lawful to put a Thief to death without warrant from the Scripture, as yee ſuppoſe it to be, yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we go beyond our warrant, only in the matter of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which puniſhment yet falleth upon the guilty Thief, who is certainly convicted by infallible teſtimony, according to Gods ordinance; but whoſoever putteth man or woman to death for bewitching people to death, or for afflicting man or beaſt with diſeaſes by Witchcraft, goeth beyond his warrant in matter of guilt, for the Scripture no where ſaith that a Witch was, or can be guilty of any ſuch thing as kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by Witchcraft, or afflicting by Diſeaſes, or any croſs or adverſity by Witchcraft upon men or cattel, and ſo in this we ſin not, in inflicting greater puniſhment upon a Witch then is due by the Law of God (for by Law we ought not to ſuffer a Witch to live) but the ſin is, in inflicting puniſhment upon the innocent, in Condemning them for Witches which are not Witches, for a Witch in the Scriptures is only a ſeducer of the people to Idolatry, and for killing without a ſtroak of the hand, or ſome material inſtrument, God claimeth it as his own Prerogative proper to himſelf only, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6 ſo that imputing it to any other, is againſt the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Fourteenthly, Some will object and ſay, <hi>Although there were no Murthering Witches ſpoken of in the Scriptures, or any ſuch deſcription of a Witch, as one that maketh a League with the Devil, or that lyeth with</hi> Incubus, <hi>or</hi> Succubus, <hi>or that hath Imps, or Biggs, or privie Marks by which they are known, yet ſuch may be ſprung up ſince the Scriptures were written, as new ſins increaſe daily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:65492:71"/>To this I anſwer, If there be new ſins it muſt be in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Law, for that maketh ſin to be ſin, becauſe it is a breach of the Law; now, <hi>No man may adde any thing to the Law of God,</hi> Deut. 12.32. and therefore we may not ſuppoſe that there be any ſins that are not mentioned in the Law; alſo ſuch ſins are not mentioned in the Goſpel; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever preacheth any other Goſpel than that we have received, let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1.9.</p>
            <p>Fifteenthly, it hath been objected by ſome, <hi>That a Judge, or a Jury-man, is not to queſtion any truth of opinion concerning the power of Witches, or what Witches are, but to be guided by the Law of the Nation, and to go according to the evidence of Witneſſes, and if any one will come and witneſs upon Oath againſt any man or woman, that he or ſhe is a Witch, the Jury ought to caſt her, and the Judge ought to condemn her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Objection I anſwer, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.6. <hi>At the mouth of two or three witneſſes ſhall he that is worthy of death be put to death, but at the mouth of one witneſs he ſhall not be put to death.</hi> It is taken for granted, that a man or woman is ſometimes given over to bear falſe witneſs, therefore God hath made it one of his Commandements, <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs;</hi> and here in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.6. God hath given us this rule to avoyd falſe witneſs, That one Witneſs ſhall not paſs as a ſufficient evidence upon Life and Death, and yet many have wrongfully ſuffered death at the mouth of one Witneſs, contrary to this Law, without examination of the condition of the Witneſs, whether Mad, or fooliſhly preſumptuous, or malicious.</p>
            <p>Secondly I anſwer, Where two or three Witneſſes are to paſs for true evidence againſt any Perſon, it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood only in matters preſcribed by the Word of God, as Murther by an inſtrument ſmitten, or caſt at a perſon, or by the hand, or by ſome apparent infallible way, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35.16, &amp;c. but not in matters that are no way grounded upon the Word, but are flat contrary to the Word of God, and are only mens imaginations, for we have no warrant to put any perſon to death upon any imaginary offence (if it were likely that two or three ſhould agree together in ſuch a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony) neither ought a Judge, or any Magiſtrate to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65492:71"/>
an Oath, or take, or hear an Oath in any thing Moral that is not preſcribed in Gods Word, but only ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary; and if two or three would ſwear point blank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any perſon to be a Witch, they ought not to be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſwear againſt any in that manner, except it be to ſwear againſt ſuch Witches as the Scripture ſpeaketh of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording the whole diſcourſe of this Book, and therein alſo they ought to give a reaſon of their Oath, and the Judge and Jury to conſider it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly I anſwer, That Oathes that have been uſually taken againſt many perſons in that kinde, are not to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, though true; as that ſuch a one hath been ſeen to have a Rat or Mouſe creep upon her, or under her Coats, or was heard talking to her Imps, theſe are not material teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but are fooliſh and ſenſleſs arguments, not grounded in the Word of God. Further, if the Witneſſes can ſwear that any perſon keepeth and feedeth Imps, it is not a material Oath, for it is as lawful to keep a Rat, or Mouſe, or Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſe, or any Creature tame, as to keep a tame Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, or Bird; and one may be an Imp as well as another, and ſo may a Flea or Louſe by the ſame reaſon; and ſo the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil need not go far for a bodily ſhape to appear in, or to ſuck mens or womens fleſh in; and it theſe were material Oathes, who then may not be proved a Witch? and yet there was an honeſt woman (ſo always formerly reputed) executed at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the year 1645, for keeping a tame Frogge in a Box for ſport and Phantaſie, which Phantaſie of keeping things tame of ſeveral ſpecies is both lawful and common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong very innocent harmleſs people, as Mice, Dormice, Graſhoppers, Caterpillers, Snakes; yea a Gentleman, to pleaſe his Phantaſie in trying concluſions, did once keep in a Box a Maggot that came out of a Nut, till it grew to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible bigneſs; all theſe are Arguments of no force; yea I further ſay, if two or three would ſwear that they ſaw ſuch a Creature ſuck any perſons fleſh, it doth not prove it to be a Devil, or that the Devil is in it, or therefore the Perſon a Witch.</p>
            <p>Laſtly I anſwer, If a Judge, or a Jury be bound by the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65492:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Law of the Nation to proceed according to that Law, yet they are bound more by the Law of God to proceed according to his Law, and if there be any Law of any Nation made to put to death people for any ſuppoſed imaginary Witchcraft, not ſpoken of in Gods Word, that Law ought to be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for we may not adde to Gods Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. and in the mean time, that Nation that maintaineth ſuch a Law, that Judge, that Jury which proſecuteth ſuch a Law (being not grounded in, but contrary to the Law of God) they all hazard themſelves under the Curſe of Gods Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.23, 24.</p>
            <p>Sixteenthly, The laſt and wiſeſt Objection is this, <hi>It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſt in the Scriptures that a Witch may kill by Witchcraft, for it appeareth</hi> Numb. 25.9. <hi>that after</hi> Balaam <hi>had tried all ways to Curſe the people, there dyed of the people twenty four thouſand, and although he could not hurt them by Inchantment (as he affirmeth chap.</hi> 23.23. There is no Inchantment againſt <hi>Iſrael) yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth,</hi> Revel. 23.14. <hi>that he taught</hi> Balac <hi>to lay a ſtumbling-block before the people, in inticing them to commit Idolatry, which brought down the anger of God upon them that they dyed, Numb.</hi> 25.9.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, This indeed is the only Witchcraft that can kill or hurt any man (according to the whole Diſcourſe of the Firſt Book, of this Treatiſe) ſeducing the people to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, whereby they do cauſe them to provoke God to anger, and to ſtrike them in his diſpleaſure; and this is the Doctrin we ought to learn by the Hiſtory of <hi>Balaam,</hi> yea this is the only Witchcraft that is ſummarily included in all the Nine tearms of Deſcription, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.10, 11. (being the diſcourſe of my firſt Book) and to ſhew any proof of any ſort of Witches in the Scriptures, I challenge all Witchmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, yet ſome will forſake the Scriptures, and confute me ſtrongly, with a repetition of ſome of <hi>Bodins</hi> lyes, or the like Stories, telling them for truth.</p>
            <p>But for all ſuch as do ſtill labour, by Objections, Cavils, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and Imaginations, to uphold the old Traditions and Errours of that grand Witch the Pope, and his Train, concerning Witches, and their Power, and not rather to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65492:72"/>
cleanſe the world from theſe Doctrins of Devils; let them take heed that the ſaying belongeth not to them, that <hi>Stephen</hi> ſpake to the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. <hi>Yee ſtif-necked and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in heart and ears, yee do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, as your fathers did, ſo do yee;</hi> As it is written, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>becauſe yee received not the love of the truth, that yee might be ſaved; for this cauſe God hath ſent you ſtrong deluſions, that you ſhould beleeve a lye, that they all might be damned who beleeved not the truth, but had pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs.</hi>

            <div type="conclusion">
               <head>A Concluſion.</head>
               <p>HE that groundeth his Opinion upon Phanſie and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man traditions, and reports, without light, and rule of the Scriptures, is like a man groping in the dark, who for want of light ruſheth his face againſt the door. But if any man will forſake blinde imaginations, and be guided by the light and rule of the Scriptures, he ſhall finde by them, that Witches are only falſe Prophets, who uſed ſeveral deluding impoſtures to deceive the people (according to the whole Diſcourſe of the firſt Book of this Treatiſe, and theſe were not poor men and women, ſuch as are commonly executed for that falſly-imputed Crime of Witchcraft) but were open practicers of their ſeveral Witchcrafts, to delude and ſeduce, and thoſe had not their Craft from a Familiar, or by making a League with the Devil, as hath been commonly imagined, but were in a manner learned, and uſed Books written for that purpoſe, to teach them their manifold impoſtures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to gain a maintenance among the people, by making them beleeve they were Prophets; as wee may read. <hi>Acts</hi> 19.19. many of them being converted by the powerfull preaching of the Goſpel, brought their Books, and burnt them before the people; theſe Books containing ſuch ſubtile devices as were practiſed then by the falſe Prophets, or Witches of the time, to deceive the people, and now adays by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Rout, and by our common Wizzards. But now for the thouſands of people that have been executed for Witches in ſeveral parts of the World, by the common manner of fond,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65492:73"/>
falſe accuſations, at whoſe hands will God require their bloud, but at the hands of the Whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of thoſe that have joyned with her in her abominations? <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.24. In her was found the bloud (not only of Saints) but of all that were ſlain upon the earth. This doubtleſs muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of thoſe that are unjuſtly ſlain, and who are they, but ſuch as are ſlain by wrongful accuſations? which wrongful accuſations are occaſioned by the devilliſh Doctrins where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe hath defiled the Nations.</p>
               <p>Further I ſay, That this Doctrin of Witches power is the main ſtrength of Antichriſtian policy; for whereas that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Whore knoweth, that in all Nations the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate will hold his power, and not reſign it to her, to have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power to kill for Religion, ſhe maintaineth this dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Doctrin to this end, that under the name of Witches ſhe may melt away all whom ſhe feareth, or ſuſpecteth will be oppoſers of her Antichriſtian pride, and herein ſhe inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Civil Magiſtrate, by her ſubtill Doctrin, to cut off whom ſhe pleaſeth; and how can that be ſaid to be a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for the defence of peoples Lives and Eſtates? where contrary to all Law theſe Villains can ſteal away both life and eſtate from whom they pleaſe (except from ſuch as are in places of Dignity, or ſo well eſteemed in Common-wealths, or have ſuch friendſhip among the potent of the Land, that thereby they are able to withſtand their Adverſaries) and theſe poor accuſed people have no redreſs, or help at the hands of the Magiſtrate; but he who ought to be their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is bewitched, and ingaged againſt them; he is taught indeed not to ſuffer a Witch to live, but never truly taught who, and what are Witches; and that many times they that ingage him by their lying Doctrin, are the very Witches themſelves, aimed at in the Scriptures, that ought not to be ſuffered to live.</p>

            <p>The firſt is <hi>James</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> ſetting forth three Books, called <hi>Daemonology,</hi> in the name and title of the Works of King <hi>James</hi> (and whether the Biſhop or the King were the Compoſer of that Work, I ſtand not to argue) which VVorks are collected out of theſe Popiſh Writers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, which the Author acknowledgeth in the Preface to his Book, where he alledgeth <hi>Bodinus, Hyperius,</hi> and <hi>Hemingius</hi> for confirmation of the truth of the matter contained in his VVorks, but not a jot of Scripture is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in all the VVork, if rightly interpreted, to prove it to be truth and yet the Author himſelf confeſſeth of <hi>Bodinus,</hi> that his Book of <hi>Daemonomanie</hi> is collected with greater dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65492:74"/>
than compoſed with judgement; and truly I wiſh every wiſe man (that deſireth to be reſolved in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning theſe Opinions) to obſerve that paſſage; or if he be ſuch a one as can read, and ſearch the ſeverall Writers of this ſubject of Witchcraft, let him obſerve the variety of their Opinions, how few of them do agree in one tenent, or in their manner of writing, by which it is eaſily concluded, that all their traditions are but Phantſies, contrary to the ſound of Gods Word; even as a wiſe Judge, exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſeveral Witneſſes of one thing, if he findeth not their teſtimony to agree, he concludeth, that they compacted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to witneſs a thing falſe; and truly, although wiſe and learned men have been deluded by theſe lying inventions, yet compare but their Opinions one with another, and alſo with Holy Writ, and you ſhall finde, that all their Opinions are but one monſtrous Devil, ſtriving to get the maſtery of the Spirit of truth; and whether this Work was either compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by King <hi>James,</hi> or by the Biſhop, may be very well ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, or rather by ſome <hi>Scotiſh</hi> man, blinded by ſome <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Miſt, who deſired to ſet forth his own Tenents for the upholding of Popiſh errours, and Popiſh Writers, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confuted before by <hi>Scot,</hi> in his Diſcovery of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, he not being able any whit to anſwer <hi>Scot</hi> in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, laboureth to uphold falſe Tenents and Doctrins, by the authority of a King, becauſe he could not finde any thing in the Scriptures to uphold them, or to anſwer <hi>Scot,</hi> as wee may read in the Preface, that his whole aime is at <hi>Scot,</hi> whom he falſly chargeth with the Tenent, and Affirmation, That there is no ſuch thing as Witchcraft; whereas <hi>Scot</hi> in all his whole Book ſaith no ſuch thing, but only that Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft is a craft of deceiving, and ſeducing the people, and not of killing and making barren, and raiſing Winds, and ſuch like Inventions; he that readeth that Preface, and ſeeth how <hi>Scot</hi> is firſt and chiefly aimed at in the whole Work, might preſently expect that in the Work he ſhould finde <hi>Scot</hi> notably confuted, or at the leaſt in ſome way anſwered, but reading over the VVork, he ſhall finde not one thing or other anſwered at all, but only a bare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65492:74"/>
of ſuch Tenents, without any ground, or warrant of the Scripture, which Tenents were confuted by <hi>Scot,</hi> by the Scriptures; ſo that for any man to anſwer that Work of the Author at large, were only to do that which <hi>Scot</hi> hath already done, in confuting <hi>Bodinus</hi> and others; and whereas this Author pretendeth a refutation of <hi>Scot,</hi> he hath done nothing elſe but written again the ſame Tenents that <hi>Bodinus</hi> and others had before written, and were by <hi>Scot</hi> confuted; like an obſtinate Diſputant, that rather than he will not hold his Argument, though never ſo fooliſh, he will deny the Concluſion. One Diſputant wiſely and plainly proveth that a thing is, and the other fooliſhly ſaith ſtill it is not; or one proveth that a thing is not, and the other fooliſhly ſtill ſaith it is; by which way of arguing a childe may hold an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt a learned Doctor, though never ſo falſe.</p>
            <p>Yet for the anſwering of the Tenents of this Author in that Work, Firſt, he ſaith in his firſt Book, as alſo in the Preface, That Witches can by the help of the Devil cauſe to be brought unto them all kindes of dainty Diſhes for their delicious maintenance; (and yet ſay I, how many poor lean ſtarved people have been executed in ſeveral places for Witches) and for the truth of this Doctrin, he bringeth no place of Scripture to prove it, but only affirmeth it to bee true, for theſe reaſons;</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Devil is a Thief, and delighteth to ſteal.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is a Spirit, and therefore can ſubtilly, and ſuddenly tranſport the ſame from whence and whither hee will; by which way of argument, rejecting the Scriptures, a man may affirm for truth any vain imagination, be it as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as this former; as, that the Devil is a Thief, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath a Mountain of Gold, which he hath taken out of every mans Purſe, and heaped up in Hell, which he being a Spirit, hath eaſily tranſported from the earth, and therefore are ſo many men haſtening to Hell, becauſe there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Gold; But if ſuch fooliſh Arguments as theſe were of any force, what need then any Scripture to teach us the truth? But if we examine the truth of this Doctrin by the Scriptures, it will prove for want of ground in Scripture very
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65492:75"/>
phantaſtical, and in oppoſition to the truth of the Scriptures very blaſphemous; for hereby we ſhould yeeld ſtill that what was done by the Angel of God in miraculous manner, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing food to <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 King. 19.6. may be done by the Devil, bringing variety of food to them that ſerve him; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God by a Miraculous hand brought his people through a barren Wilderneſs, and fed them in that Wilderneſs; the ſame thing might as well have been done by the Devil, who (ſaith he) can bring his ſervants all manner of dainty diſhes.</p>
            <p>This that is already written were enough to diſable and make voyd all the three Books of <hi>Daemonologie</hi> written by this Author but yet for the ſatisfaction of ſuch as will expect a Methodical anſwer, I will begin with his Works in order as they ſtand, and in brief ſhew the vanity of them; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, he ſaith in his Epiſtle to the Reader, Sorcery and VVitchcraft are different from <hi>Magick,</hi> and <hi>Necromancy,</hi> and yet in the firſt Chapter of the Second Book, he ſaith, the Maid ſpoken of in the ſixteenth of the <hi>Acts</hi> was a VVitch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had the ſpirit of <hi>Python,</hi> and yet we finde in the Scripture, that they that had the ſpirit of <hi>Python</hi> were alſo <hi>Necromancers;</hi> how then can this diſtinction hold, that VVitchcraft differeth from <hi>Necromancy?</hi> for by that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a <hi>Pythoniſt</hi> were a VVitch, and a <hi>Necromancer</hi> not a VVitch; yet what was the <hi>Pythoniſt</hi> of <hi>Endor</hi> but a <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer,</hi> pretending to conſult with the dead? and <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy</hi> was the pretence of all that were ſaid to have the ſpirit of <hi>Python;</hi> that was, that they conſulted with the Souls of the dead, as in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and alſo in holy VVrit, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19. (it is manifeſt in any Tongue but our <hi>Engliſh</hi>) which in <hi>Tremellius</hi> tranſlation is to this ſenſe; for when they ſhall ſay unto you, Ask counſel of thoſe that have the ſpirit of <hi>Python</hi> (or the impoſture of Oracling) and of South-ſayers, ſhould not a people ask counſel of their God?

fourth Chapter he bringeth in healing by Charms, and Stones, and Herbs, as if by his method they were a part of Aſtrologie, and not only in that hath he ſhewed his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but in reckoning Stones and Herbs among Magick Charms. In the Fifth Chapter he ſaith, Magicians conjure the Devil in a Circle, and if they miſs the leaſt circumſtance, the Devil breaketh into the Circle, and carrieth quite away Body and Soul; and yet ſaith, a little before, in the ſame Chapter, that the Devil having preſcribed that form of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he may ſeem to be commanded thereby, will not paſs the bounds of thoſe injunctions (Circles). In the ſixth Chapter he talketh, That they make a League with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil written with their bloud, and ſo learn of him to play Jugling Tricks, and Tricks upon the Cards and Dice (in which alſo he ſheweth himſelf but a ſilly Gameſter, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Tricks cannot be played without a League with the Devil) and yet by his diſtinctions, and by his whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he ſaith, theſe Magicians (though in league with the Devil) are no Witches, which is contrary to the general Tenent that ever was of his own Sect (that is where ſuch a League was made, it made a Witch) but to ſpeak the truth, the ill coherence of the Writings of his, and all other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that ſort, ſheweth, that they have no ground but Phantſy, and Fiction, for any league or tranſaction with the Devil, either by Magician or Witch (to uſe his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction (though ſenceleſs) either in Scripture, or Human reaſon guided by the Scripture, and this is the whole ſcope of his firſt Book.</p>

of Magicians, Inchanters, Diviners, and Sorcerers, but not of Witches diſtinct from theſe, for theſe were Witches in all the Scripture-ſence, and Diviners were Magicians, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians were Sorcerers, and Inchanters were Witches, and ſo were all the reſt; but ſtill mark how he laboureth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome proofs beyond all this, whereby he would make a Witch ſomewhat (he cannot tell what) diſtinct from Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Diviners, Inchanters, and Necromancers; for ſaith he, the Maid that followed <hi>Paul</hi> crying, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. was a Witch, whoſe ſpirit of Divination was put to ſilence, ſaith he, and ſhe was a Witch, becauſe ſhe did not raiſe the Devil, but hee ſpake by her tongue publickly, and privately, and that by her conſent, and this is his ultimate proof of a Witch; which I grant; ſhe was a Witch, but why diſtinct from the reſt? what was ſhe more than a Diviner? and the Scripture ſaith ſhe had the ſpirit of <hi>Python,</hi> which was a ſpirit of lying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie or Divination; and ſaith he, ſhe was a Witch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Devil ſpake by her tongue, and that by her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as if he ſpake not by the tongue of all Diviners, Inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Pythoniſts, South-ſayers, Necromancers, and all falſe Prophets, and that by their conſent; ſhe was a Witch ſaith he, becauſe ſhe raiſed not the Devil, but yet ſay other Writers of his Sect, they are Witches that raiſe the Devil, and ſhe had been a Witch if ſhe had raiſed the Devil; and he himſelf in his ſeventh Chapter ſaith, Devils are made commonly to appear by Witchcraft; from theſe grounds in Scripture, (which are all ſpoken of Deceivers, and falſe Prophets, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the whole diſcourſe of my firſt Book, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were Witches in the Scripture-ſenſe, though weakly diſcovered by this Author) he goeth on preſumptuouſly in the ſecond and third Chapters, to ſay that Witches are ſuch as do compact with the Devil, and in great number meet in Houſes, and Churches, and adore the Devil in Pulpits, and learn of him to do miſchief, and do render account at their ſeveral meetings, what miſchief they have done for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to kiſſe his hinder parts for adoration, and this is all the ſcope of his ſecond and third Chapters, without any tittle of proof from Scripture, but only confeſſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65492:77"/>
people (which is no proof) being contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon, and (all Circumſtances conſidered) is no Confeſſion; for as he dully argueth in his firſt Chapter, that becauſe they are loath to confeſs without Torture, therefore they are guilty; we may argue the contrary, they therefore are not guilty, their Confeſſion being extorted, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion yet he would argue to be true, becauſe ſaith he, the Devil was worſhipped among the Heathen, and gave Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and Reſponſes, and was honoured with bloudy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and gave Divinations by the intrals of Beaſts; But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe things were done by Heathen people that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped Idols, and had Oracles, and Reſponſes from their Idol Prieſts (which were the Witches, and falſe Prophets of the times) and in that ſence might be ſaid to worſhip the Devil, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.19, 20. (becauſe the Devil was in the Idols, or rather in their Prieſts, and ſo by them wrought deluſions under the mask of Idols) yet what conſequence is here, that becauſe the Devil was in this ſence worſhipped publickly by Idolaters, that therefore he is now privately worſhipped by the great Conventions and Aſſemblies of Witches? or where do we read in Scripture, that Witches were ſuch as did meet to worſhip the Devil? they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch as ſeduced people to worſhipping of Idols, by the deluſions of the Devil ruling in their hearts. And in the fourth Chapter be ſaith, that VVitches can be tranſported in the Air, by the Devils help, becauſe <hi>Habbakkuk</hi> was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Angel, in the Hiſtory of <hi>Daniel Apocrypha,</hi> which if this were a true ſtory Canomical, yet what abſurdity is this, to equalize the Devils power with the power of God by his Angel? And what conſequence is here? If the Angel did ſo tranſport, therefore the Devil doth tranſport; and yet this is the whole ſcope of his fourth Chapter. In the fifth Chapter his whole ſcope is, That VVitches can make pictures of VVax, or Clay, and roſt them, and ſo conſume the party whom they intend, and can receive from the Devil ſtones and powders, and by them caſt on can Cure diſeaſes; that they can raiſe Storms and Tempeſts, and do many ſtrange things, and that no man is ſure to eſcape their
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65492:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
VVitchcraft, which as I have ſhewed in my ſecond Book, are not only inventions and fictions of Antichriſt, without ground in Scripture, but flat againſt Scripture, and the faith of Chriſtians to beleeve.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith further, The Devil can ſend VVitches to poyſon people, I anſwer, ſo he may teach any man elſe that will undertake it; for that is not any whit more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a VVitch than to any other murthering-minded man or woman, no more than ſtabbing with a Knife or Dagger, The ſcope of the ſixth Chapter is, That the Devil appears to VVitches, and teacheth them to do miſchief, but yet they have not power to hurt a Magiſtrate; but ſure if VVitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft conſiſted any whit in the Art of poyſoning, why then is the Magiſtrate free? for certainly many Magiſtrates yea Judges, and Kings themſelves, have been poyſoned; hath a VVitch then leſs faculty in poyſoning Magiſtrates then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men have had? why then is their Craft counted ſo dangerous? The ſcope of his ſeventh and laſt Chapter is, that Spirits did more commonly appear in time of Popery than now, and the reaſon thereof he giveth before he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it to be true; that is, that the Goſpel hath diſpelled thoſe Spirits that were wont to appear. This reaſon hath a ſmooth pretence if it were given of a true thing, but the thing which he argueth upon is not true, for there were no more Spirits ſeen in time of Popery than now (and that is juſt none at all) but there were more lyes reported by papiſts, and in time of Popiſh ignorance, than now, and the Goſpel indeed hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thoſe Popiſh Errours which were wont to deceive the people more than now; and who ſo denyeth that Spirits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, he ſaith they are Sadduces, whereas yet there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any ſuch diſpute among Sadduces, whether Spirits did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear viſible or not; neither were the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that oppoſed the <hi>Sadduces</hi> ſo ſilly as to affirm any ſuch thing; but if any ſuch thing were, as viſible apparition of Spirits, doubtleſs at had been no Controverſie, for the <hi>Sadduces</hi> might have ſeen them as well as the <hi>Phariſoes;</hi> this is the ſcope of his Firſt and Second Book. And here I am compelled to go back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the third Chapter of the Firſt Book, to anſwer one of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65492:78"/>
his Tenents, which I think very material to be anſwered out of order, becauſe if I had taken it in order it would have ſpoyled my method in anſwering ſo curtly as I have done, (his writing being ſomewhat immethodical.)</p>
            <p>Look in his firſt Book, the third Chapter, and ſee how he by the bare ſignification of a word, laboureth to ground an abſurdity, ſaying, <hi>Necromancy</hi> is one that Propheſieth by the dead, and that is, ſaith he, one that conſulteth with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, aſſuming the body of the dead party; but as I have ſaid, what <hi>Logician</hi> doth not know that it is not a legal manner of arguing, but moſt abſurd to draw a Concluſion from the bare ſignification of words, or from what words may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie? but he that argueth truly, muſt argue as the words are taken, and not as they may ſignifie, and alſo ſearch the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſence of the Hebrew, and yet for the word it ſelf it hath not the leaſt ſignification of the Devil, or that the Devil can aſſume a dead Body, or the leaſt ſignification of Prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Devil, but only by the dead, according to the vain Tenent of the Heathen, that the Souls of the dead (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their perfect eſtate after this life) could inſpire men living upon the earth, with knowledge of things to come, in which pretence theſe Witches called <hi>Necromancers</hi> uſed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinations, or lying Prophecies, as manifeſtly appeareth in <hi>Plutarch, de. defect. Orac.</hi> and by Scripture, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more fully in the Ninth deſcription in my firſt Book; and as for that Tenent, that the Devil can aſſume and raiſe a dead Body, it is moſt abſurd and blaſphemous, for it was by the divine miraculous power of Chriſt upon the Croſs, that the bodies of the dead were raiſed for a time, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto many, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.52, 53. from whence the Centuirion acknowledged Chriſt to be the Son of God, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſuch things could not be done but by the mighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God; yet if this abſurdity were true, That the Devil could aſſume the bodies of the dead, it makes nothing to prove their common main Tenent, that Witches are ſuch people as can kill by Witchcraft, for a Necromancer is only one that taketh in hand to Propheſie by the dead, or to give divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not one that killeth, or witcheth people to death;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65492:78"/>
neither doth it agree with this Authors diſtinctions to hold any ſuch Tenent, that a <hi>Necromancer</hi> is one that conſulteth with the Devil aſſuming a dead body, for he ſaith in his Sixth Chapter of his Second Book, and alſo in the third Chapter of the Third Book, that the Devil appeareth to Witches, and they conſult with him, having aſſumed a dead body; why then doth he in his former diſtinctions make a difference betwixt a Necromancer and a Witch?</p>
            <p>And now to proceed to the Third Book, as followeth, He laboureth to prove in his Third Book, That the Devil can appear bodily, and doth commonly haunt Houſes and Fields in ſhape of men departed this life, and ſometimes as Fairies, ſometime in manner of <hi>Browning</hi> (as he calleth it) that is it that by our old Wives Fables is called <hi>Robin Good-fellow)</hi> and that theſe are true, and not falſe Fables, and for that in his firſt Chapter he allegeth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.21. where it is ſaid, That <hi>Zim</hi> and <hi>Ohim</hi> ſhall dwell in their houſes, and <hi>Jim</hi> ſhall cry in their Palaces, which ſaith he, are in the Hebrew the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names of Devils; but how erroneous this expoſition is, let them that can read the Hebrew text ſee, and for them that cannot read the Hebrew text, let them read the Latine tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius,</hi> which is thus; <hi>Et recuba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt ferae illic, &amp; implebunt domos eorum noxia animalia; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitabunt<expan>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65492:79"/>
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.13. that the Devil dwelt at <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and yet it is not meant that he was there ſeen at all to appear in any ſhape, but was there in the hearts and works of wicked men; but ſuch is the manner of all that are tainted with Popiſh Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, that they would have people conceive of the Devil, that he is ſome ugly terrible Creature to look upon, ſome black man with a pair of Horns on his head, and a Cloven Foot, and a long Tayl, or ſome monſtrous Beaſt that inhabiteth in Woods, and walketh about in the night to ſcare people, and this doctrin is maintained by Popiſh Writers, leaſt people ſhould diſcern that the Devil is in all their Popiſh Doctrins and actions, and in the hearts of all Popiſh ſeducers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers of the world.</p>
            <p>Further, in this his Third Book he talketh of <hi>Incubus,</hi> and <hi>Succubus,</hi> as if it were an undoubted truth that the Devil lyeth commonly with Witches of both Sexes, having copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with them, but for this he hath not the leaſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor the leaſt ſeeming Argument, but only conſtrained, extorted, belyed, nullified Confeſſion of poor condemned people, which is the only Argument for all the devilliſh Tenents of all Writers of this ſort, and yet they begin with Scripture, ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Witch to live;</hi> and upon this they raiſe a long diſcourſe, contrary to all Scripture, and truth, and poſſibility, all which they will father upon the Scriptures, and yet when they are pinched by diſpute to prove their Tenents by Scripture, they fly off to confeſſion; this confeſſion I ſay is in all the diſcourſe of this Author his only Argument (which is no Argument) and yet he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his diſcourſe to be grounded on the Scriptures, and in that pretence in his laſt Chapter he concludeth his whole diſcourſe with the Law of God, ſaying, Therefore theſe people ought to be put to death according to the Law of God, whereas yet in all his diſcourſe he could not produce the leaſt jot or tittle of the Law againſt any ſuch kinde of ſuppoſed Witches as he talketh of, nor the leaſt colour of argument to prove his ſuppoſals, in all the Law, or all the Scriptures, without miſconſtruing the Law of God, and the Scriptures.

as have been ſlain, becauſe they would not fall down before an Idol, and worſhip it (as this <hi>Cooper</hi> laboureth to prove his errours concerning Witches from the example of many that have been executed for Witches) and then ſhould fetch them over with an uſe of reproof, that ſay Idols are no gods; and after this groundleſs uſe of reproof, this <hi>Cooper</hi> goeth on ſtill in a frivolous diſcourſe, without any Scripture to prove his Doctrin, and at laſt laboureth to ſhew that Juglers are Witches, which no man yet did ever deny (if they were ſuch as wrought falſe Miracles to ſeduce the people, as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer) but he laboureth to prove that common Juglers are Witches, that do work their Tricks of Activity, ſaith he, by a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, which yet (ſaith he) are no real Miracles, but they hurt the Eye, and thicken the Air, ſaith he, whereby they make things ſeem to be really done that are not done; which thing for a Jugler to do, that is, to hurt the eye, and touch it not, and to thicken the Air were a Miracle it ſelf; but to clear theſe vain Fancies, who knoweth not that Juglers do play their Tricks only by the ſlight of hand, called <hi>Cleanly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance,</hi> or <hi>Legerdemain?</hi> and what common Jugler that hath gone about to Fairs, or Markets, to ſhew his Tricks of Activity to get Mony, will not in private for a ſhilling ſhew any Trick that he hath acted openly, and ſhew how it is done to the ſatisfaction of any man that deſireth it, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Familiar, or the leaſt appearance of any ſuch vain Phantſy as fools imagine; But yet if I ſhould take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that theſe common Juglers are Witches, and do work their Feats by a Familiar Devil, as he affirmeth, yet what doth that make towards the proving of theſe poor, and aged, and lame people to be Witches, that have ſo commonly been ſaid to be Witches? What Tricks of Activity have they ſhewed, either in Fayers or Markets, or in publick, or in private? ſurely if they had been Condemned for Witches, for any ſuch thing doing, they ſhould not need to be found out by an Inquiſitor, to be tried by Biggs, or privie Marks, or by ſinking or ſwimming in the water, for their actions would declare them openly. Alſo if common Juglers were

Witches, as he ſaith; yet how doth this prove that a Witch is a Murtherer, which is the main drift of his Book; and to that end he bringeth many places of Scripture to prove that there are VVitches, which thing no man doth deny. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he affirmeth, that Witches do make a real League with the Devil, (which hath been a common fooliſh traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and for that he alledgeth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.5. where ſaith he the Original yeeldeth thus, <hi>Which heareth not the Charmer, or mutterer, joyning ſocieties together,</hi> where (ſaith he) the Holy Ghoſt ſetteth down the effect of a Charm, namely, that it is able to ſtay the Adder from ſtinging thoſe that ſhall touch him; but mark how this fellow belyeth the Scriptures, for which (becauſe many underſtand not the Hebrew) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre them to the Tranſlation of <hi>Iunius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius,</hi> which is this; <hi>Quae non auſcultat voci muſſitantium, utentis incanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus peritiſſimi,</hi> which hearkeneth not to the voyce of mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, or of the moſt skilful uſer of Charms; ſo that there is not a word of joyning Societies together, not a word of the Devil, nor of any league with the Devil; yet if it had been ſo, and that he could have proved ſuch a League or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, it had made nothing to prove that a Witch is a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer (which is his drift) for a League might be made for a Deceiver, as well as for a Murtherer; And whereas he ſaith the place aforeſaid proveth the effect of a Charm, that it can ſtay the Adder from ſtinging, it proveth the clean contrary; for if the Prophet had ſaid the Adder hearkneth to, or regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the voyce of a Charmer, it had proved that a Charm is effectual; but in that he ſaith the Adder regardeth not, or hearkneth not to the voyce of the Charmer be he never ſo skilful, it proveth that a Charm is of no force; and indeed the Prophet doth there allude deridingly to the vanity of that Idolatrous conceit of the Heathen, who thought that charms had vertue in them, and ſo were ſeduced by charms to put confidence in charms and conjurations, according to the Sixth term of deſcription in the Firſt Book of this Treatiſe, ſhewing the common conceit of the Heathen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning charms, appearing in their Poets; <hi>Frigidus in pratis, cantando rumpitur anguis.</hi>

tradition of men, and the impetuouſneſſe of the times, and the authority of ſuch Writers, as hee calleth the learned, as that although hee hath writen ſome Truths (in preaching alſo whereof hee hath done much good in Gods Vineyard, in labouring to ſtay that bloody perſecution on foot againſt the poor and Innocent) yet he hath much ſwerved from the Truth of this ſubject of Witches and Witchcraft, in that hee yeildeth at all to the common contagion of Error that hath defiled the World, (not that Witches are, for that were my Error to deny, ſeeing the Scriptures do manifeſtly condemn them) but that Witches in the Scripture ſence, are ſuch as have made a familier compact with the Devill, and receive power from him to kill and the like; I wonder (but that the hour of darkneſſe is not yet fully paſt) that ſo many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould ſtill wander in this darkſome imagination; what leaſt intimation or deſcription of ſuch a kind of Witch hath God given us in the Scriptures? or of Devills in the corporall ſhape of Imps, making a familier compact with any of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, or any ground for ſuch imaginary whimſes of mans brain, what conſequence is there in Logicall diſpute, or in Theologicall Principles, that hee that denieth theſe phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, denieth that there is a Devill, and ſo finally that there is a God; the Scripture teacheth us that there is a God, and likewiſe a Devill, or Devills; but what Scripture ſpeaketh of a familiar Devill, or Jmp? or that a Witch can kill by Witchcraft, or hurt either body or goods, by Witchcraft, by the Devills help, either by Gods permiſſion or without? I rather think that this forſaking of the Scriptures, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for Doctrin the traditions of Antichriſtian Popiſh Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is a forſaking of God, and conſequently a denying of God; hee ſaith hee could inſtance from ſtory, how many have had no Faith of Witches being, till their bewitched body or goods, hath ſerved to unwitch them of their opinions and conceit; is this a Theologicall way of Argument to ground a Doctrin upon vain reports, and phantaſmes without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? yea flat contrary to the Scriptures? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.6, 7. dare any man contrary to thoſe and many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture (when hee is afflicted in body or goods) aſcribe

               <p>THere is yet another Book come to my hand written by Mr. <hi>George Giffard,</hi> an able Miniſter of Gods Word in <hi>Maldon,</hi> which becauſe the common way of ſome mans ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing is by queſtioning, what ſay you to this? and what ſay you to that Author? therefore I will give a brief deſcription of his Tenents, which are chiefly three; the firſt is, That a VVitch can not by a Familiar, or by any craft, any way hurt, or weaken the life, health, or eſtate of any man, by bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with diſeaſe, or infirmity, either Man or Beaſt, or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Goods; and this he proveth plainly by Scripture, and Reaſon, as I have alſo done in my Second Book of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Tenent is, That VVitches have Imps and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars. The third Tenent is, That theſe Familiars do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing really, but only do deceive the VVitch, by making her beleeve they do that which cometh to paſs upon Man or Beaſt by Divine providence; but for theſe two laſt Tenents he doth not prove by Scripture as he did the firſt, nor yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm for truth, but only being overcome by the ſtrength of common report, grounded upon the Confeſſion of ſuch as have been executed, he only yeeldeth to thoſe ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which have deceived many, Hypothetically arguing, if Witches have ſuch Imps or Familiars, they are only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them; but herein is he not confident, and therefore theſe two laſt Tenents being not confirmed by him do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm nothing, and for the firſt of the two, That VVitches have Imps, is ſufficiently diſproved in my Second Book, and that all their Confeſſions are no argument; then for the laſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, having reference to the firſt, it is in like manner nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for if they have no Imps, nor no Familiar, then they are not deceived by them, nor do beleeve or confeſs any ſuch thing, wherein they ſeem to him to be deceived, any further than Confeſſion is wrung from them, by them who are the deceivers of themſelves and others, by the Deceiver of the VVorld, that dwelleth in them, except ſometimes by the

                  </q> Theſe are the words of <hi>Luther,</hi> and where he ſaith at the laſt, that the Devil could carry Chriſt whither he liſted, it is his errour, for the Devil did not carry him at all, but led him by temptation, as appeareth, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. and as I have more at large written in my Second Book, in my anſwer to the Sixth Objection, if you look back to it; yet from this brief Diſcourſe of <hi>Luther</hi> may be obſerved, That the Devil may be ſaid to be an inſtrument in all Diſeaſes, croſſes, and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as <hi>Luther</hi> proveth by the Story of <hi>Job,</hi> and the ſaying of Chriſt concerning the woman, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.11.16. and as is expreſſed, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.14. but yet it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be true that the Devil is Gods Inſtrument in all theſe afflictions, as <hi>Job</hi> acknowledgeth in all his afflictions, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing all to God, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.22.2.10.9.34. and God claimeth theſe things as his own Prerogatives, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.39.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:65492:85"/>From all which it is fully concluded, That the Devil is only Gods inſtrument to afflict and tempt the righteous, to afflict, tempt, and torment the wicked, and in all this doth nothing but by Gods peculiar diſpenſation, not by a bare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, nor by the appointment of a VVitch; whatſoever ſome have written more concerning the nature of Devils, as that there are <hi>Incubus,</hi> and <hi>Succubus,</hi> the He Devil, and the Shee Devil, that the Devil maketh a League with VVitches, and that the Devil is the VVitches Inſtrument as well as Gods, and that by Gods permiſſion; that the Devil walketh in Church-yards, and near Sepulchers, and in deſolate places; that he is black, that he aſſumeth a Corporal ſhape, that hee hath a Cloven Foot, that he walketh in the dark Nights, that he ſometime roareth, and maketh a fearful noyſe, that he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſcare people in VVoods and Fields, that there are fiery, aiery, earthy, and watery Devils, that there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, orders, and ſupremacies among Devils, that ſome are greater in power than others; theſe are all diſſonant to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are only the vain fancies of men, who delight to fill the world with Fables.</p>
               <p>And whereas ſome do argue from <hi>Matthew</hi> 12.24 that ſome Devils are greater in power than others, and alſo in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and ſuperiority, becauſe <hi>Beelzebub</hi> is there called, <hi>The Prince of Devils,</hi> it is to be underſtood that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him the Prince of Devils, becauſe <hi>Baal-zebub</hi> was the chief Idol by which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had been defiled ſometimes, and was by them called therefore, the chief Devil, or the Prince of Devils, and was called by them <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> by an Antithiſis, putting <hi>e</hi> for <hi>a,</hi> which Idol was ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 1.2. and <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> do both agree in that Expoſition, that it is meant of <hi>Baalzebub,</hi> if we look their Notes upon <hi>Matthew</hi> 10.25. and <hi>Beelzebub</hi> may bee interpreted, <hi>The Prince of Flies,</hi> not becauſe Devils are Flies (as ſome imagine in the Story of <hi>Francis Spirah)</hi> but becauſe his Temple was peſtered with Flies through the ſmell of the abundance of Fleſh that was there ſpent daily, and alſo becauſe the Country being much troubled with Flies, the people uſed to ſeek to that Idol for help againſt that annoyance of Flies, ſaith <hi>Beza.</hi>

               <p n="1">I. A man is found dead in the Fields, who a little before went out well; another man being his Adverſary is queſtioned for his Life, as being ſuſpected to have murthered him; this man proving that he was a hundred, or two hundred miles from the place where and when the man dyed, is quit by the Law. I demand then, what Juſtice is in that Law that quiteth him, if he might ſend the Devil, or leave order with the Devil or with his Imps, to Witch him to death at that time?</p>
