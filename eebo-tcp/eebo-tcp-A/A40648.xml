         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We live in a troublesome and tumultuous age; and hee needs
<pb facs="tcp:98091:3"/>
to have a very soft bed, who can sleep soundly now a-dayes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst so much loud noise, and many impetuous rumors. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it seemeth to Mee, both a safe and cheap Receipt, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Quiet and Repose to the Mind which complains for want of rest, to prescribe unto it the reading of History.</p>
            <p>Great is the pleasure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof.<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lul.</hi> 19. 4</note> 
               <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> wee know, was low and little in stature, but when hee had borrowed some height from the Fig-Tree, into which he climbed, the Dwarfe was made a Gyant on a suddain; last minute beneath the Armes, but now grown above the heads of other men. Thus our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall knowledge is, in it selfe, both short and narrow, as which cannot exceed <hi>the spanne of our owne life.</hi> But when wee are mounted on the Advantage of
<pb facs="tcp:98091:3"/>
History, we can, not onely reach the yeere of Christs Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but, even touch the top of the worlds beginning, and at one view over-see all remarkable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of former ages.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, untill such time, as I shall by Gods providence, and the Authority of my Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, bee restored to the open Exercise of my profession, on termes consisting with my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, (which welcome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, I doe heartily wish, and humbly wait for; and will gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily listen to the least whisper sounding thereunto) it is my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (God willing) to spend the remnant of my dayes in reading and writing such Stories as my weak judgement shall commend unto me for most beneficiall.</p>
            <p>Our English Writers tell us of <hi>David</hi> King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:98091:4"/>
whilst he was Prisoner in a Cave in <hi>Nottingham</hi> Castle, He, with his Nailes, shall I say carved, (or) scratched out the whole History of our Saviours Passion, in the Wall. And although the Figures be rough and rude, yet in one respect they are to bee compared unto, yea, preferred before the choysest Pieces, and most exact Platformes of all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravers, being done at such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages; cut out of a maine Rock, without any light to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him, or Instruments to help him, besides his bare hands.</p>
            <p>The Application of the Story serves mee for manifold uses. First, here I learn, if that Princes, then meaner Persons, are bound to finde themselves some honest employment. Secondly, that in a sad and solitary condition, a Calling is a comfortable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. Thirdly, where men
<pb facs="tcp:98091:4"/>
want Necessaries, fit Tooles and Materialls, the worke that they doe, (if it be any degree passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,) deserves, if not to bee praised, to bee pardoned. Which encourageth me to expect of the charitable Reader, favour for the faults in this Tract commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when hee considers the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in effect banished, &amp; Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and wanting severall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations requisite to the compleating an History.</p>

And then seeing no Remedie but Death, their Soules did not bow by degrees, but fell flat in an instant; of Lions, turning Calves, halfe dead with feare, received the fatall stroake of the Executioner.

to breake iests on men<note place="margin">

Now to refresh the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a-mid'st so many murders, and Massacres; it will not be amisse, to insert an unexpected Marriage. <hi>Alexius</hi> left <hi>Anna</hi> an Empresse Dowager. And some days after her husbands death, he addressed himself a Sutor unto her, being to encounter with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible disadvantages. First he came reaking with the bloud of slaine <hi>Alexius.</hi> And what hope could hee have that shee would embrace that Viper, that had stung her other-selfe to death!

of his Age, being past 70.<note place="margin">

Now, whether it was out of Childishnesse, not being full fourteene, or out of feare, being farre from her friends, and her Person in his power; or out of pride, loath to abate of her former State; she assented to his desire. But to speake plainely, he sheweth him selfe to have store of leisure, and want of worke, who is imployed to finde a Root

               <p n="22">22. To make this story passe for probable, we may fellow it, with the like in our English Chronicles.

There was amongst the Greeks a constant practice, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Crueltie, and strengthned by Custome; that if a Vessell was discovered in danger of drowning, those on the shore,
