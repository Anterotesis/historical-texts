            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Therefore also now saith the <hi>LORD,</hi> Turn ye even to Me with all your heart, and with <hi>Fasting,</hi> and with <hi>Weeping,</hi> and with <hi>Mourning.</hi>

            <p>THough the <hi>time</hi> of this <hi>Prophecy</hi> be uncertain, so that neither the <hi>Jewish Rabbins,</hi> nor <hi>Christian Antiquaries</hi> are able to give us any tolerable account of it, yet is the <hi>Design</hi> plain, and the words of my <hi>Text</hi> a most proper and pathetick enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Great <hi>duty</hi> of this <hi>day,</hi> to <hi>turn unto the Lord our God with all our Heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning,—for he is Gracious and Merciful, slow to Anger and of great Kindness, and repenteth him of the Evil.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60631:4"/>
If we look into the foregoing <hi>Chapter,</hi> we shall there find an astonishing Account of the great Evils that were just ready to befall the <hi>Jewes</hi> for their Sins. But that which is yet more surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, is, That though all this was about to come upon them, yet were they nevertheless <hi>insensible</hi> of their <hi>danger,</hi> nor took any the least care to prevent their utter desolation.</p>
            <p>To awaken a stupid and inconsiderate Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a Nation dead in Sin and Security, in the beginning of this <hi>Chapter</hi> he prepares a lofty and magnificent <hi>Scene.</hi> He sets before them a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> of yet greater dangers than any they had hitherto experimented, and that in a manner so unusual, with such a Pomp of Words, and in such Triumphant Expressions, as carry a terror even in the Repetition of them.</p>
            <p>Blow ye the Trumpet in Zion, sound an Alarm in <note place="margin">Joel II. 1.</note> my holy Mountain; Let all the Inhabitants of the Land tremble, for the day of the <hi>LORD</hi> cometh; for it is nigh at hand: A day of darkness and of gloominess; <note place="margin">—2.</note> a day of Clouds and of thick darkness; as the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spread upon the Mountains; a great People and a strong, there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it. A fire devours before them, and <note place="margin">—3.</note> behind them a flame burneth: The Land is as the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60631:4"/>
of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness. The Earth shall quake before them; the <note place="margin">—10.</note> Heavens shall tremble; the Sun and the Moon shall be dark; and the Stars shall withdraw their shining.</p>
            <p>Whatever be the Import of these Phrases; whether by the mighty and <hi>terrible Host</hi> here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, we are only to understand that <hi>swarm</hi> of <note n="a" place="margin">Judaei pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in diebus <hi>Joel</hi> tam innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merabilem Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custarum super judaeam venisse multitudinem, ut cuncta com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plerent, &amp; non dicam fruges, sed ne Vinearum quidem &amp; ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum Cortices, ramosque dimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terent, ita ut om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni virore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpto arentes arborumrami, &amp; sicca vinearum flagella rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerent. <hi>Hieron. in Joel I. v. 6.</hi>

            <p>And now, who would not here expect the <hi>final desolation</hi> of such a People as this? But behold, God even yet in his <hi>Anger remembers Mercy;</hi> and tho they had hitherto neglected all the Calls and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of his holy Prophets to <hi>Repentance,</hi> yet He resolves once more to try, whether they would now at least in their dangers hearken to his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60631:5"/>
Admonitions: He raises up <hi>Joel</hi> at once both to set before them his Judgments, if they continu'd still <hi>impenitent;</hi> and to encourage them, by <hi>repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> not only to prevent their Ruine, but to assure themselves of his Favour. That though they had so long neglected him, yet if they would <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. ver. 12.</note> 
               <hi>now,</hi> even now at the last, return with a true Zeal, and a sincere Affection to their Duty, they should not fail to meet with a favourable acceptance from him:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore also now saith the</hi> LORD, <hi>Turn ye even to me, with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning: And rent your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the</hi> LORD <hi>your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not my intention to seek a Parallel of all this, either in the <hi>sins,</hi> or in the <hi>danger</hi> of our own Countrey. I would willingly hope, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our <hi>Guilt,</hi> nor our <hi>Incorrigibleness</hi> have been so heinous as theirs, nor shall any such deplorable <hi>Judgment</hi> as this, ever, I trust, be made the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what our Iniquities have indeed but too justly deserved. No, blessed be <hi>God,</hi> who by a wonderful Concurrence of great and singular Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60631:5"/>
seems rather to call upon us to celebrate his Goodness, than to deprecate his Judgments; to praise his Name in <hi>Hymns</hi> of Triumph and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, than to <hi>weep between the Porch and the Altar,</hi> in melancholly <hi>Litanies</hi> to avert his Anger, and implore his Mercy. But yet since the <hi>Goodness,</hi> as well as <hi>Judgments</hi> of the Lord, are designed to bring us to <hi>repentance,</hi> and that whether we look back into our own particular Actions, or consider those Publick and National Transgressions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have so long and loudly call'd to Heaven for vengeance; we must with shame and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation confess our selves some of the greatest of Sinners; I cannot but think, both the Solemn Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of <hi>this Day,</hi> and the Design of my <hi>Text,</hi> to be a most proper and seasonable Admonition to us, to <hi>turn unto the Lord our God,</hi> and to implore his Blessing upon our present Enterprises, that those vile <hi>Insects,</hi> the <hi>Locusts</hi> and <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> that have so barbarously consumed our Neighbours round about us; our worse than <hi>Assyrian</hi> or <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonian</hi> Enemies, may not be able to prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us.</p>
            <p>And indeed, however it has pleased God, as at this time, to give us some Encouragement to <hi>trust in his Mercy;</hi> yet we cannot so soon forget,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60631:6"/>
that we have also born the <hi>punishment</hi> of our <hi>sins.</hi> For not to repass upon the things that are at a greater distance from us; let the Instances still fresh in all our Memories, speak to us: What just Apprehensions did we but very lately lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our <hi>Lives,</hi> and of what is yet dearer to us than our <hi>Lives,</hi> our <hi>Liberty,</hi> and our <hi>Religion?</hi> How did our Enemies not only project our Ruin, but as, if it were already accomplished, begin to say in their hearts, nay, they began freely to speak it out to us; <hi>Aha! so would we have it: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. LXXI. 9.</note> 
               <hi>them, and take them; for there is none to deliver them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if now we are no longer exposed to those dangers that <hi>so lately</hi> threatned us; if God has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, upon our late more serious Concern for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and more general return to him, to give us some Testimony of his gracious Designations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; This certainly ought to be so far from lessening our <hi>solemn Humiliation</hi> at this time, that it should rather engage us to be the more forward in perfecting our <hi>Repentance,</hi> the greater Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement we have to hope, that it shall be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at our hands. And I must now beg leave, with so much the more Earnestness, to enforce the <hi>Duty</hi> of my <hi>Text:</hi>
               <q>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60631:6"/>

            <p>And here I presume I shall not need to tell you, That all this is but a larger Paraphrase of what I may in other <hi>Words</hi> call a <hi>General</hi> and <hi>National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> of those <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>National Sins</hi> which had provoked <hi>God Almighty</hi> to send down so many Judgments upon them, and to threaten them with yet greater, if they continu'd still in their <hi>Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</hi> And indeed, what could be more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than by such a Solemn and Universal Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment both of the <hi>Evils</hi> they had committed, and of the Judgments which they deserved, and of the <hi>sorrow</hi> they were now touch'd with for their Offences, to appease <hi>God's</hi> Anger for that General Incorrigibleness, by which they had so long expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed both his <hi>Goodness</hi> and his <hi>Justice</hi> to Contempt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Heathen</hi> round about him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60631:7"/>
For however it be very certain, that all the <hi>outward pomp</hi> and <hi>solemnity</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> the <hi>fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the <hi>weeping,</hi> and the <hi>mourning,</hi> are at best but a <hi>form of Godliness,</hi> empty and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, unless there be also added to these that <hi>true</hi> and <hi>inward change of Mind,</hi> in which alone consists <hi>the Power of it;</hi> yet there may be such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and Cases put, wherein this Duty must pass beyond the <hi>Heart</hi> and the <hi>Closet,</hi> and the Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation will be imperfect, if it be not as <hi>publickly</hi> set forth to the <hi>Eyes of Men,</hi> as it is <hi>sincerely</hi> perform'd in the <hi>sight of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And such especially must be the <hi>Repentance</hi> for <hi>National</hi> Sins. Where Mens <hi>Transgressions</hi> have been <hi>open</hi> and <hi>notorious,</hi> there their <hi>Return</hi> also must be no less <hi>Solemn</hi> and <hi>Evident;</hi> that so the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as well as Justice of God may be vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Forgiveness; and some sort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made not only for the Guilt which they have contracted, but also for the Scandal which they have given to his Honour and Religion in the World.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis this which at once both declares the <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and commands the <hi>publick Humiliation</hi> of THIS

                  </gap>. Chrys. Hom. ad pop. Aniooch. 3.</note> And for the due discharge whereof, I must intreat you to go along with me in these following Reflections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> That though, as I have just now shewn, there must be the <hi>publick marks</hi> of <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Humiliation</hi> in our <hi>publick Repentance,</hi> yet we must by no means stop in these; nor think that this is all that God requires of us in order to our forgiveness.</p>
            <p>This was indeed the Vanity of the <hi>Jews</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and is too much the folly of some mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided <hi>Christians</hi> now. Their Indignation against their Sins, and against themselves for having committed them, was spent especially in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance of sorrow. <hi>They rent their Cloaths;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. iii. 31.</note> 
               <hi>and put on sackcloath; they wept, and fasted and went</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 King. xxi. 27.</note> 
               <hi>softly;</hi> and then they supposed they had done their business; though it may be their Souls were not yet Humbled; nor their Hearts at all <hi>broken</hi> with any true <hi>Contrition</hi> for their <hi>Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so among those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day. If we may believe some of their greatest Casuists, an <hi>external Worship</hi> is sufficient to carry a man to Heaven, without the trouble of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60631:8"/>
the true <hi>inward Devotion</hi> of the <hi>Soul:</hi> He may <hi>repent</hi> without <hi>Contrition;</hi> may <hi>fast</hi> with a full <hi>Meal:</hi> Nay, and if the <hi>Pope</hi> pleases, <note n="d" place="margin">This Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage is so very Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that I ought to give some Account of it. Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> IX. having grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a large <hi>Indulgence</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> whether the <hi>Lombards,</hi> by reason of the Wars they then had, could not go to gain it, at the Prayer of <hi>John Galeas, Visconte</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> he grants the same <hi>Indulgence</hi> to <hi>Milan</hi> he had done at <hi>Rome, viz.</hi> that all the Subjects of the said <hi>Galeas,</hi> though they had neither <hi>Confess'd</hi> their Sins, nor were <hi>Contrite</hi> for them, should yet be <hi>absolved of all their Sins;</hi> only for <hi>visiting</hi> a few <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>paying</hi> the <hi>Sum of Money</hi> prefix'd by the said <hi>Bull:—Cioè</hi> (says their own Historion) <hi>che Ciasciascuno nel dominio del Visconte, se ancho non fosse contrito, ne Corfesso, fosse assoluto di ogni peccato.</hi> Bern.

            <p>I shall not need to say how many <hi>new ways</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> of this kind they have found out; by wearing a <hi>Leathern Girdle</hi> about their Loins, or <hi>Scapularies</hi> over their <hi>Shoulders;</hi> by <hi>listing</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <note place="margin">

This is certain, that all these,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60631:9"/>
and whatever Artifices of the like kind, Men may please either to flatter themselves, or to delude others withal, without a true <hi>Contrition,</hi> and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Reformation</hi> they are all but Vanity; They make a <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> in the <hi>Eyes of Men,</hi> but they avail nothing to our <hi>forgiveness</hi> with <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not dispute of what use some of these <hi>External Performances</hi> may be to assist our <hi>Repentance,</hi> and render our <hi>Sorrow</hi> for Sin the more <hi>solemn,</hi> and so in <hi>some Cases,</hi> as I have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, the more <hi>pleasing</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> I know well enough that St. <hi>Paul</hi> has told us, that <hi>Bodily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,</hi> where 'tis discreetly order'd, does <hi>profit a</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>little,</hi> though it be not like <hi>Godliness, profitable for all things.</hi> But then as 'tis plain, that the greatest part of those Follies so much magnified and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> are but vain and ridiculous Impositions to cheat the silly and superstitious Multitude; so 'tis certain that the best of these things are neither in themselves <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious,</hi> much less <hi>Satisfactory</hi> for <hi>Sins,</hi> as they pretend them to be, nor otherwise of any value at all with God, than as they are attended with that <hi>true Repentance,</hi> which alone can either incline his Mercy or obtain our Forgiveness.</p>

No, it is not so much as once mentioned among the Reasons of it. It was the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Lives</hi> that tied up his Hand, and sheathed his Sword, ver. 10. <hi>And God saw their Works, that they turn'd from their Evil way; and God repented of the Evil that he said he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60631:10"/>
2. And this brings me to a second Remark for the farther clearing of this great Duty; <hi>viz.</hi> That not only these <hi>outward marks</hi> of <hi>penitence</hi> are not sufficient to the discharge of it, but though we should to these add a <hi>true and real sorrow of heart</hi> for the Sins we have committed, even this would not be sufficient to purchase our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness.</p>
            <p>Now by <hi>true sorrow,</hi> I do not mean that little <hi>imperfect sorrow,</hi> which looks rather to the danger of our Condition, than to the heinousness of our Offences; and bewails our Transgressions more out of an apprehension of those Judgments that may be the Consequence of them, than out of any real regret that we have sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a most Gracious and Merciful God. For however those of the other <hi>Communion,</hi> out of their great tenderness to Sinners, have declared such a <hi>sorrow</hi> as this, if accompanied with <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> to be sufficient for Mens <hi>Salvation;</hi> and therefore have resolved, that <hi>true Contrition</hi> or a <hi>sorrow for sin comitted, with a purpose of sinning no</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Conc. Tr. Sess. xiv. cap. 4.</note> 
               <hi>more, is not necessary to the Sacrament of Pennance, after the Commission of mortal Sin, but that</hi> Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>is sufficient, though a Man knows it to be no more;</hi> Yet I suppose it needless in this place to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60631:10"/>
obviate any such <hi>gross Error,</hi> however other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of very great danger, in the Practice of this Duty. Be the <hi>sorrow for sin</hi> never so sincere; and our <hi>Resolutions</hi> thereupon no more to return to the Commission of it never so firm and well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet if instead of making good these Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we shall stop here, we are but half Penitents; we yet want that change of life, which alone is able to compleat the Nature, and render the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our Repentance acceptable unto God, and available to our forgiveness.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In short, thirdly, if we will truly discharge that <hi>Repentance,</hi> to which we are here called, we must do it not by being <hi>sorry</hi> for our <hi>Sins,</hi> or by <hi>resolving</hi> against them, but by an effectual <hi>forsaking</hi> of them; <hi>i. e.</hi> as our <hi>Text</hi> speaks, <hi>By turning unto the</hi> Lord <hi>our</hi> God. This is that which alone can implore his Favour, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to his Mercy. And this was what I before observed in the <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Niniveh: When God saw their works that they turned from their Evil way,</hi> then <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented him of the Evil that he had said he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, but it is not any <hi>turning unto God</hi> that will suffice neither: We must <hi>turn</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Veraciter integraliter. Lyr. Mercer.</note> even <hi>unto him,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:60631:11"/>
and <hi>with</hi> all <hi>our</hi>

               <hi>Heart:</hi> Words very Emphatical, and which offer to us two great <hi>Conditions,</hi> which are absolutely necessary to render our <hi>Conversion</hi> every way such as it ought to be. <hi>First,</hi> That it must be <hi>hearty</hi> and <hi>sincere:</hi> There must be nothing of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> mix'd with it; our Souls must go along with our outward Performances; and these penitential appearances be the true De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of that real inward <hi>sorrow</hi> which we feel in our Hearts for our Offences. For <hi>God</hi> is <note place="margin">Psal. xliv. 21. 1 Chron. xxviii. 9. Rom. viii. 27.</note> not a <hi>Man</hi> that he should be <hi>mocked.</hi> He sees into our very <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>knows the secrets of all the Children of Men.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it must be <hi>intire</hi> and <hi>without reserve:</hi> As we must be <hi>sorry</hi> for <hi>every Sin</hi> we have already committed, so we must resolve against ever committing <hi>any</hi> for the time to come; <note place="margin">Habac. i. 13.</note> For <hi>God is of purer Eyes than to behold the least Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and if our <hi>Repentance</hi> be sincere, so shall we be too. The same Piety which moves us to hate any Evil, will equally fill us with an Aversion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all. And if we desire to continue but in <hi>one Offence,</hi> it is because that we do truly <hi>repent</hi> of <hi>none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that now then if we will answer the design of <hi>this day:</hi> if we will render our <hi>fast</hi> such as the <hi>Lord has chosen,</hi> and has promised to reward with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60631:11"/>
the <hi>Blessings</hi> both of <hi>this life,</hi> and of that which is to come; we must not think it enough that we comply with the outward Ceremonies and shew of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> but we must indeed resolve to bring forth the fruits of it. Whilst we Address our selves to God for Pardon, we must take heed to dispose our Souls in such a manner, that we may be fit to receive it.</p>
            <p>And if we thus improve the great Solemnity of <hi>this day,</hi> we shall not fail to meet with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable acceptance at <hi>the Throne of Grace. God</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Joel. ii. 18.</note> 
               <hi>will be jealous for his land, and pity his People:</hi> He will perfect the great Deliverance he has begun for us, and once more render us the fear and the <note place="margin">Deut. ii. 25.</note> terror of all our Enemies round about us. Our <hi>Faith</hi> which has so often triumph'd over all the Arguments of its Adversaries, shall now no less triumph over all their black Designs to root it out and to destroy it; and shew to all the World, that though for our Tryal God may sometimes permit the <hi>Winds to blow, and the Flouds to rise, and the Storms to beat against our Church,</hi> yet has he founded it on that <hi>Rock</hi> that shall never fail; <hi>Nor</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matt. xvi. 18.</note> 
               <hi>shall the gates of Hell,</hi> either the Power of <hi>France</hi> or the Cunning of the <hi>Jesuit,</hi> or the Malice of <hi>Both, ever be able to prevail against it.</hi>

            <p>

And <hi>1st</hi> Of the <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of God to the <hi>Greatest</hi> of <hi>Sinners</hi> upon their <hi>Repentance.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>God</hi> Proclaimed his own <hi>Name</hi> in the midst of the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> we read in the xxxiv. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that he chose to do it not so much in the terrible Attributes of his <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> as in the soft <hi>Idea's</hi> of his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, The</hi> Lord, <hi>the</hi> Lord God, <hi>Merciful and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>long-suffering and abundant in Goodness and truth; keeping Mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin.</hi> And if we look into all the following Representations which he makes of himself, whether by his <hi>Holy Prophets</hi> under the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> but especially by our Blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> under the <hi>Christian Dispensation,</hi> we shall find there is no <hi>Character</hi> he so much delights in as this of <hi>being Good and Gracious, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to Repentance.</hi> 2 Peter iii. 8.</p>
            <p>And now what more forcible Encouragement can any one desire to bring him to <hi>Repentance,</hi> than to be thus assured of the <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60631:13"/>
of God to the greatest of Sinners, if they <hi>Repent?</hi> That he will not only forgive him upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but will even assist him with <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> in the doing of it. That he <hi>desires not the death</hi> of the most Profligate Offender, <hi>but rather that he should turn from his wickedness and live.</hi> In a word, That he has promised <hi>forgiveness,</hi> without exception, to the most wicked Men upon their <hi>Repentance;</hi> so that if they will but <hi>yet break off their evil Course, and keep his Statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, they shall surely live, they shall not dye.</hi> Ezek. xviii. 21.</p>
            <p>Many are the ways, and excellent the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that God has taken to convince us of his Mercy, and the time would fail me to enter on a particular Consideration of them.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he declares not only that he is <hi>ready</hi> to <hi>pardon</hi> us if we <hi>repent,</hi> but that he even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires we should <hi>repent</hi> that he may <hi>forgive</hi> us. And least his <hi>Word</hi> should not be sufficient, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that <hi>desire</hi> with an <hi>Oath,</hi> Ezek. xxxiii. 11. <hi>As I live, saith the</hi> Lord God, <hi>I have no pleasure in the death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his way and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your Evil ways, for why will ye die O House of Israel?</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60631:13"/>
Sometimes he <hi>Expostulates</hi> with us in the way of <hi>Reasoning,</hi> to see if by that means he may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring us to consider his Love and Affection to us. Isai. i. 16. <hi>Wash ye, make ye clean, put away the</hi>

               <hi>Evil of your doings from before mine Eyes; cease to do</hi>

               <hi>evil, learn to do well.—Come now and let us reason</hi>

               <hi>together, saith the</hi> Lord: <hi>Tho your Sins be as Scarlet,</hi>

               <hi>they shall be white as Snow; though they be red like Crimson, they shall be as Wooll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he Exhorts us to <hi>Repentance,</hi> he always does it upon this <hi>Promise,</hi> that he will <hi>Pardon</hi> us if we <hi>repent. If we turn from our Sins, Iniquity shall not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezek. xviii. 30.</note> 
               <hi>be our ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he threatens <hi>Judgments,</hi> yet still he keeps a reserve for <hi>Mercy</hi> to triumph over <hi>Judgment;</hi> and will rather be thought inconstant in his most Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Decrees, than inexorable to <hi>Repenting Sinners.</hi> Thus he commanded <hi>Jonah</hi> to go to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and to pronounce an utter destruction against it. He fix'd the very <hi>time</hi> too, <hi>Yet four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>

               <hi>days and Niniveh shall be overthrown.</hi> But what now was the issue of all this? Why, the <hi>City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and feared God, and turn'd from their Evil way: And God repented of the Evil that he said he</hi> 
               <note place="margin">—10.</note> 
               <hi>would do unto them, and he did it not,</hi> Jonah. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:60631:14"/>
And what must the Consequence of all these <hi>Reflections</hi> be, but to engage us not to dispise the Goodness of God, whereby he thus Graciously invites us to <hi>Repentance;</hi> but to conclude with Holy <hi>David,</hi> Psal. cxxx. 3. <hi>If thou</hi> LORD <hi>shouldst be extream to mark what is done amiss, O</hi> God <hi>who may abide it? But there is Mercy with thee, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shalt thou be feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what I have now said of <hi>Gods mercy</hi> in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, will yet more hold in the other Part of this <hi>Character,</hi> wherein is set out to us in Particular.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> his great unwillingness to pronounce any <hi>Judgments</hi> at all against <hi>Sinners,</hi> and his readiness to recal them upon their <hi>Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He is</hi> slow <hi>to</hi> anger, <hi>and</hi> repenteth <hi>him of the</hi> Evil.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And because I would now, were I able, speak not so much to your <hi>Reason,</hi> as to your <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> to your <hi>Consciences</hi> and <hi>Affections;</hi> I will for the Proof of this no more lead you back to the <hi>Israelites</hi> in this <hi>Prophecy;</hi> to <hi>Past-times,</hi> and unknown <hi>Countries;</hi> but will rather desire you to consider your own <hi>Times,</hi> your own <hi>Country,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60631:14"/>
and if you will allow me freely to add it, your own <hi>Souls.</hi> Which of all these will not afford me an <hi>evident Demonstration</hi> of the <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>long-suffering</hi> of God? And speak him in the words of the <hi>Text,</hi> to be a God <hi>slow to anger, and that repenteth him of the Evil?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That after so many <hi>Sins,</hi> as we have every one, the very best of us <hi>committed,</hi> we are yet alive this day, whereas God might, if he had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, long since have cut us off in the <hi>midst</hi> of our <hi>Sins:</hi> That after so many calls and invitations as he has sent to bring us to <hi>Repentance,</hi> he is still pleased to call and to invite us to it: That notwithstanding we have so far abused his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>long-suffering,</hi> as to improve that which above all things should have the most engaged us to our Duty, into an encouragement to go on the rather in our <hi>Sins;</hi> he nevertheless still continues to us the Offers of <hi>Pardon and Peace,</hi> if we will even now <hi>in this our day consider the things that make for our Peace:</hi> What is all this but a most Demonstrative, as well as a most Affectionate Proof, that God is indeed <hi>slow to anger, not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that any should perish, but that all should come to Repentance?</hi>

That he has deliver'd us out of so many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, in which, but for his <hi>Providence</hi> over us we must long since have perish'd: That he has smitten us in <hi>Mercy,</hi> not in Judgment; to correct and admonish, not to ruine and destroy us: That upon our deprecating his Anger, he has at any time heard our Prayers, and answer'd our Desires: What is this but a plain Evidence <hi>that he smites not willingly, nor loves to afflict the</hi>

               <hi>Children of Men:</hi> and so is a God <hi>repenting him of the Evil</hi> that he is at any time forced either to <hi>threaten</hi> us with, or to <hi>bring upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we look into his Dispensations towards us in the common concern of our Country and our Religion; How <hi>slow</hi> must that God have been <hi>to Anger,</hi> who after so many years Attendance, nevertheless still calls upon us, as at <hi>this day, to turn from our Evil way, and from the violence that</hi>

               <hi>is in our Hands, that our Iniquity may not be our ruine?</hi>

            <p>And for his <hi>repenting him of the Evil,</hi> which we have sometimes forced him by our continual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations to send upon us: Let the <hi>Instances</hi> which we our selves have known suffice to tell us, how unwilling he has shewn himself to bring us to an utter desolation.</p>
            <p>

When it pleased God for our iniquities, <hi>to despise, in his indignation, both the King and the Priest;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lam. ii. 6.</note> and by the deplorable Judgment of <hi>Civil Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> had proved and exercised us about Twenty Years; with what a Miracle of Mercy did <hi>he</hi>

               <hi>turn again the Captivity of Sion,</hi> and restore to us both our <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> as before?</p>
            <p>When this would not do, but our <hi>Sins</hi> and our <hi>Prosperity</hi> return'd together; so that we were again in a very few years become <hi>ripe for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> He called forth a <hi>destroying Angel;</hi> He put a new Sword into his Hand, and commanded him to slay his <hi>Thousands and Ten Thousands in our Streets.</hi> The PLAGUE consum'd our Strength, and hardly was that pass'd, when an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Vengeance, a <hi>devouring</hi> FIRE, such as scarce any Age or Country has ever heard of, burnt down our Dwellings.

            </p>
            <p>And yet how did he then cover us with his hand in that day of his displeasure? He neither suffer'd our Enemies to invade us from abroad, nor any Domestick Quarrels to embroil us at

home. He preserved us in Peace; he sent again the Blessings of Plenty and Prosperity among us, and our City is risen more Great and Glorious out of its Ashes.</p>
            <p>What shall I say to the <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>jealousies</hi> we have labour'd under since, from a restless Party, Enemies to the Name of <hi>Protestant,</hi> and by <hi>Principle</hi> conjured, if they can, to root it out of the World?</p>
            <p>In how many <hi>dangers</hi> has God delivered us? And how many Designs, for ought we know, may he have prevented, which have not yet been brought to light? And when at last, either to awaken us the more effectually to a <hi>Repentance</hi> of <hi>our sins,</hi> or it may be to accomplish the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>their Iniquities,</hi> he deliver'd us over for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while into the hands of our Enemies; and to convince the most incredulous among us, what the true <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>prevailing Popery</hi> is, suffer'd them with such an inconsiderate Fury to pursue our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, that no Ties, either of God or Man, were sufficient to restrain them; but all Obligations, whether of <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Conscience,</hi> were equally trampled under their feet: How did it then please our <hi>Almighty Defender</hi> to assert his <hi>Character</hi> of being a God <hi>repenting him of the evil</hi> that he had
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60631:16"/>
brought upon us, in a manner that is the <hi>Wonder</hi> and <hi>Astonishment</hi> of the present, and, that I am perswaded, shall be the <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Triumph</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi> in all succeeding <hi>Generations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He raised us up a <hi>Deliverer</hi> out of the <hi>House of his Servant David.</hi> He touch'd his <hi>Princely</hi> Heart with a Generous Sense both of the Evils which we had suffer'd, and of the greater that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. His <hi>Honour</hi> and his <hi>Zeal</hi> enflamed him to do somewhat worthy Himself; and that might answer the mighty Hopes God had prepared us to conceive of Him. He medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the great Work of delivering our <hi>Countrey</hi> from <hi>Oppression,</hi> and our <hi>Religion</hi> from <hi>Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And by the Blessing of God, he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd it, in a manner, so extraordinary in all its Circumstances, as, I think, should not suffer us to doubt from whose Providence it was, that this <hi>Redemption</hi> was sent to us. This <hi>was the Lord's doing, and,</hi> whatever it is, I am sure ought to be, <hi>marvellous in our Eyes:</hi> And may, I think, be a <hi>final,</hi> I hope it shall be an <hi>effectual</hi> Confirmation to us of this Great Engagement of our <hi>Text,</hi> to <hi>turn to him with all our hearts; viz.</hi> That he is a God <hi>repenting him of the evil;</hi> and therefore whose <hi>Mercy,</hi> if we now

truly do so, we may securely depend upon both for the <hi>forgiveness</hi> of our <hi>sins,</hi> and for our <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> from those <hi>dangers</hi> which our <hi>sins</hi> have so justly exposed us to.</p>
            <p>And now what remains, but that having all these great Encouragements, such <hi>Promises,</hi> or rather, such an <hi>Earnest</hi> of God's Favour to us, we resolve, every one of us, seriously to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the great Design both of this <hi>Day</hi> and of this <hi>Discourse;</hi> and by our sincere <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> for our past Offences, obtain that Blessing we so much desire both for our <hi>Countrey,</hi> and for our <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Never was there a <hi>time</hi> wherein we had greater Reason to hope for God's Acceptance than at this Day; and such an <hi>Occasion</hi> as this, to implore his Favour, there may not perhaps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain occur in the Course of many Ages.</p>
            <p>For indeed what is it that we are now as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled to recommend to His Mercy, but in Effect the preservation of our <hi>Selves,</hi> our <hi>Laws,</hi> our <hi>Liberties,</hi> and our <hi>Religion,</hi> against the Violence of those who have long conspired both <hi>Their</hi> and <hi>Our</hi> destruction.</p>

            <p>And this he will do, if we be not our selves wanting to our own preservation. Only let us act as becomes <hi>Good Christians,</hi> and <hi>True Englishmen;</hi> let us do all things for the Glory of God, and for the Safety, Honour, and Welfare of our Country: In the words of <hi>Joab</hi> to his Brother <hi>Alishai,</hi> upon an Occasion not much different from our own at this time; <hi>Let us be strong, and of good Courage, and let us</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But if instead of pursuing the things that make for our Peace, we shall still go on to precipitate our own destruction: If when we are call'd this Day <hi>to</hi> turn <hi>unto the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> God <hi>with</hi> all <hi>our</hi> hearts, <hi>and with</hi> fasting, <hi>and with</hi> weeping, <hi>and with</hi> mourning; we shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead thereof <hi>fast</hi> only for <hi>strife</hi> and for <hi>debate:</hi>
