            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we conſider thoſe dangerous
diſturbances that this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hath of late yeares labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
under, 'tis certaine, that
in a generall and originall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration,
we cannot but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
them to the wrath of God
for the ſinnes of this nation.
But in a ſecond and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
conſideration, we may properly aſſigne them
unto the violent Councells of ſome late Miniſters of
State, who either for want of Counſell; or by mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
practice, have brought this State, from a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
firme and ſtrong conſtitution, to ſo weake and
feeble a temper, that the great Phyſitian the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cannot, but with extreame difficulty, apply
remedies fit and proportionable to the diſeaſe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96351:3"/>
but they inevitably run ſome hazard of indangering
the body it ſelfe; it being very perilous to apply
ſtronger remedies then the ſtrength and conſtitution
of the patient can well beare.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, You were truly told by a grave and
worthy Member, at the beginning of this Parliament:
that it muſt be ſome extreame neceſſity that would
rectifie and recover this State; and that when that
extremity did come, it would be a great hazard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it might prove a remedy or a ruine. And this is
occaſioned, chiefely becauſe violent diſeaſes, doe moſt
commonly require violent remedies, and, violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
are ordinarily pregnant of new miſchiefes:
which hath cauſed your States, beſt skilled in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement,
alwayes to diſcerne evill a farre off in
their cauſes, and by their wiſedome and fore-ſight,
prevent them: and I am confident, had we had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Parliaments, we ſhould have given a timely
ſtop to miſchiefes, and never have ſuffered them to
have broken in upon us with ſuch an inundation of
diſtempers, that without Divine prevention, may yet
ſwallow and deſtroy us.</p>
            <p>Mr. Speaker, 'Tis obſerved of the <hi>Romane</hi> State, a
patterne of beſt governement, ſo long as they held up
their firſt vertue and valour, that after a great defeat
by <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Polye</note> their confederates began to forſake
them. But <hi>Hero</hi> King of <hi>Siracuſa,</hi> having ſo pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a judgement, that he could ſee through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to the future; and obſerving the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate
and conſtant in all their proceedings; even
in this extreame exigent of their affaires, and that
their Lawes were never more ſtrictly obſerved by
their Magiſtrates,<note place="margin">Lin.</note> nor their people more obedient to
their Senate or Parliament, and how their Military
Diſcipline was never likewiſe more ſeverely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
this wiſe Prince ſeeing their foundations ſtood
thus firme, ſent them Preſents of great value, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96351:3"/>
correſponded with them in a ſtricter league of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
then ever before. Not unlike a good Phyſitian,
who ſeeing favourable ſimptomes, in the ſtrongeſt fit
of his patients diſeaſe, conceives firme hope of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
recovery.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. Speaker, if we ſet before us an Image or
repreſentation of thoſe diſtempers we ſtand environed
withall; there could not poſſibly be that extreame
danger in them, but that there might be good hopes
of a ſpeedy recovery, had we kept cloſe and conſtant
to thoſe grounds of Religion, Lawes and Military
Diſcipline, which have bin noted by wiſeſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators,
to have bin the maine cauſe next under God,
of the ſtrength and duration of a State.</p>
            <p>But Sir, If we examine it, how have our very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
bin ſhaken? what Superſtition and Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have bin brought in upon our Religion of late
times by ambitious heady and paſſionate men? And
from this fountaine originally as I conceive, flowes moſt
part of our preſent diſtractions. Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
of ſacred and pretious memory to this nation, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
ſtedfaſt and conſtant to this ground of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
kept this Kingdome peaceable and united at
home, afforded a comfortable influence and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to the Proteſtant parties abroad, and after a
long and happy Raigne, went unto her eternall reſt in
glory.</p>
            <p>And truly Sir, I ſpeake it with all humility, yet with
ſome confidence, that I ſhall never expect, to ſee the
quiet ſetled ſtate of this Kingdome, till there be ſome
courſe taken to ſettle Religion to ſome rule and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
and not to be thus ſuffered in an uncertaine
condition, betweene illegall Innovations and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions
on the one ſide, and I know not what lawleſſe
and Irregular confuſion on the other.</p>
            <p>And let us all I beſeech you, calmely and ſeriouſly
conſider, how naturall a motion tis to moſt men,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96351:4"/>
not limited by ſome Law, when they are come out
of one extreame, wherin they have bin held by feare, to
run with a ſwift violent courſe into another extreame;
from ſuperſtition and idolatry to irreverence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Gods publike Worſhip and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>For our Laws (Mr. <hi>Speaker)</hi> how have they bin
violated by illegall Taxations, Impriſonments, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies,
and other preſſures, wherby the Subject hath
bin proſecuted and grieved; but this is ſo obvious to
every mans underſtanding and ſence, that I ſhall not
inſiſt upon it.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I come next to our Military Diſcipline,
and how hath this ground of ſtrength bin ſhaken,
partly by the loſſe of able and experienced Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in fruitleſſe, if not dangerous, attempts abroad;
and partly by neglect, and not duly keeping up our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
at home.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> Every man may lay it as lightly to heart
as he pleaſe, but I ſhall be bold to tell you that all
the Laws that we have or ſhall make for the defence
of our Religion or Liberties without provident care
in this particular will be but like to ſumptuous and
glorious ſtructures without roofe or covering, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to all weather and ſtormes that ſhall ariſe, and
whatever Parliaments ſhall with great wiſdome and
providence plant for the good eſtate of future times,
without due proviſions for our Military defence, may
be ſoon cut down again by the violence and malice of a
ſtronger ſword.</p>
            <p>Therfore (M. <hi>Speaker)</hi> as you have taken a provident
care for the ſecuring of the Havens and Port Towns, ſo
I deſire there may be timely conſideration had of the
Inland ſtrength of the Kingdome, and that the Muſters
in all Counties of the Kingdome be carefully (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in theſe perilous times) kept up; and that care
be taken that every County may have a ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of pouder, and other proviſion for their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96351:4"/>
defence. And that all commands may reſt in
faithfull hands, and that certificates of the true ſtate
of all things how they ſtand for defence, may from
time to time be ſent either to the Councell of Warre
you appoint for <hi>Ireland,</hi> or to any other whom the
Parliament ſhall think meet, and therupon to take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
from time to time, to ſupply all defects, as well of
Captains, as of Munition, Pouder, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> This point is more timely to be had in
conſideration, becauſe our perils will increaſe, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
eſtates ſettle and compoſe their affairs to their beſt
advantage: And therfore I ſhall deſire that our qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe
may not reſt any longer upon ſo tickle a ground,
as the unquietneſſe of our Neighbour Kingdoms; for
no State ſtands firme and ſecure, but upon its owne
foundations.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more with which <hi>I</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
and I ſhall humbly repreſent it as, in my weake
opinion, a great cauſe of our growing diſtempers,
which is the abundance of humours we have ſtirred,
and not purged away, which are but fit fuell for freſh
fires to take hold of, if it ſhould burſt forth; therefore
as there be a great number of this State, <hi>Qui paena &amp;
calamitate publicae impunitatem ſibi ſpondeus;</hi> I ſhall
make it my humble motion and deſire, that we make
ſome ſevere examples of ſome few of the moſt capitall
offenders, and either pardon the meaner delinquents,
if Juſtice will admit therof, or at leaſt to let them in
ſome reaſonable time know what they may truſt too; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
you ſhall have as many as looke deſperately
upon their owne fortune be too ready to give their vote
for troubles, and ſeek their owne peace in the publike
diſturbance, the number of whom, as I conceive, would
be warily prevented, eſpecially in theſe times of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
diſtraction.</p>
            <p>Sir, I have troubled you too long, and am not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96351:5"/>
but to object to my ſelf, that some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
are of more inſtant preſent conſiderations than any
thing I have touched upon. As your ſending <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
for <hi>Ireland,</hi> but I deſire as thoſe affairs are in ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
ſure ſetled in a way we may timely apply our
ſelves to the Root and cauſes of our diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and to begin with thoſe of moſt
importance, and to proceed
with them to effect.</p>
