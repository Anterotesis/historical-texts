         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT's a Matter worthy of ones enquiry, how a Nation, as <hi>SCOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND,</hi> ſo much addicted to <hi>Military Arts,</hi> and ſo conſtantly ingaged in both Foreign and Domeſtick Wars, ſhould have been in a Capacity to erect ſuch ſuperb Edifices as that Kingdom abounds with. There is no Country in <hi>Europe</hi> that can brag either of greater Piles of Buildings, or a more regular Architecture in its Ancient Churches and Religious Fabricks, than <hi>Scotland</hi> was Miſtreſs of about an Age or Two ago. To inſtance One for all, the Metropolitan Church of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> was probably the bigeſt in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi> being Seven Foot longer and Two Foot broader than that of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; and for the Heighth and Embelliſhing of its Pillars and Roof, the Beauty of its Stones, and Simetry of its parts, was one of the beſt of the <hi>Gothick</hi> kind in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>READER,</hi> You may receive this Impartial Account from me as a Foreigner, who am now ſettled in this Nation; and having met with the uſual Civility and Kindneſs Strangers are treated with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, it is no wonder if I am tempted to leave ſome little Marks of Gratitude behind me, in tranſmitting to Poſterity thoſe <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Remains</hi> of former Ages, and oblige other Nations with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of ſo many conſiderable Places; which I preſume will be very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to them. It is a Work of ſo great Charge, and will require ſo many Volumes, that I cannot ſatisfy the Publick but from Time to Time in it. And according to the Reception theſe firſt Endeavours ſhall meet with, it will encourage me to go on with the reſt. In the mean time, I hope no Perſon will take Exceptions, though the Towns, and ſuch of the Nobility, whoſe Arms are here inſerted, are not always placed conform to the Rank they keep in Parliament; it being a Thing which cannot be adjuſted in a Work of this Nature till the whole Deſign is compleated.</p>

By the moſt ancient Inhabitants it was called <hi>Dun Eden</hi>; by the <hi>Latins, Edinodunum,</hi> and by the <hi>Germans, Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burghen</hi>; all which ſignifie the ſame thing.</p>

               <hi>Dun Eden</hi> ſignifies a Town upon a Hill, or rather a City of the <hi>Edeni,</hi> ſituated on a Hill. The <hi>Edeni</hi> are thoſe who by <hi>Ptolemy</hi> are termed <hi>Ottodeni,</hi> which Word (as ſome Learned Men think) was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for <hi>Scottodeni,</hi> the two firſt Letters <hi>Sc</hi> being worn out with Time: For near to this City is <hi>Curia Ottodenorum,</hi> whoſe Name remains to this Day in a Village Four Miles Weſt from the City, called <hi>Currie</hi>: And two Miles Weſt from the Town is <hi>Corſtopitum</hi> (which alſo was among the <hi>Ottodeni</hi>) which is a Village commonly called <hi>Corſtorfin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calls this Place <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Caſtrum alatum,</hi> the <hi>Winged Caſtle,</hi> which is not ſo called from that kind of Wings which the <hi>Greek</hi> Builders (as ſays <hi>Vitruvius</hi>) call <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (which are double Walls ſo riſing to the Height, that they reſemble Wings: For it is likely there was no regular building in that Place at that time) but that they were ſuch as by the Poet <hi>Juvenal</hi> are called <hi>Caſtella Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantum</hi>; which ſort of Caſtles we may ſee deſcribed by <hi>Tacitus, Annal. Lib.</hi> XII. where he ſays, That upon high Mountains, and other Places of difficult Acceſs, he built up Stones in Form of a Fence, where the River did run on a ſlippery Ford. Now theſe Fences of Stone were nothing elſe, but Stones caſt together without Mortar, which is alſo clear from the ſame Author in the fore-cited Place, where he ſays, The Souldiers holding their Bucklers over their Heads for a Defence, pulled down the unwrought and ill-built Stones; which could not have been ſo eaſily done, if they had not been caſt together without Mortar. And certainly our Anceſtors choſe out this as a very fit Place for a Fort of that Nature: For the Hill where the Caſtle ſtands is exceeding ſteep and craggy, and the Aſcent very difficult, except where it looks to the Eaſt, which Part they fortified with Stones caſt together as before. The Aſcent on which the City now ſtands had, and yet hath upon the North-ſide, a ſtanding Pool, which is commonly called the <hi>North-Loch.</hi> Upon the South-ſide of the Hill there was likewiſe another ſtanding-Pool called the <hi>South-Loch:</hi> The Verity of which the Rights and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſome Houſes of St. <hi>Ninian</hi>'s Row, do teſtifie, which are let with the Privilege of a Boat annexed; and theſe two <hi>Lochs</hi> or <hi>Lakes</hi> bounded the City upon theſe two Sides, as the <hi>North-Loch</hi> does it at this Day upon the North-ſide; but the <hi>South-Loch</hi> was drained a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years ago, and upon the Banks thereof are built two ſeveral Tracts of Houſes, between which (in the Place where the <hi>Loch</hi> it ſelf ſtood) is a Street called the <hi>Cowgate.</hi> And ſo the Breadth of the City
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62127:7"/>
toward the South, is far extended beyond its former Limits; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Length thereof toward the Weſt is much enlarged, for the Graſs Market and Horſe Market are now within the City-Wall.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon why this Place is called <hi>Caſtrum Alatum,</hi> or <hi>The winged Caſtle,</hi> is to be taken from the very Nature of the Place: For, beſides the Lakes on both ſides, there are two Hills near the Rock on which the Caſtle ſtands, <hi>viz. Sarisbury</hi> and <hi>Neils Craigs,</hi> ſo named from the ſometime Owners thereof, which in a manner reſemble Wings, as is eaſily perceived Coming to the City from the South-Eaſt by the Sea Side; for then theſe Rocks appear like Wings ſtretched forth, and the Rock on which the Caſtle ſtands, like the Head of a Bird with a Tuft. And this is the genuine Derivation of the Word.</p>
            <p>I know there are ſome learned Perſons who will have <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s <hi>Caſtrum Alatum,</hi> to be in another part of the Country, and not to be <hi>Edinodu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> ſeeing he makes his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to be amongſt the <hi>Vacomagi</hi>; but <hi>Ptolomy</hi> muſt be born with in all his Miſtakes of the Situation of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces here; for being an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> living in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and forced to take things upon Truſt, and follow the Relation of others, it is no Wonder if he be ſometimes miſtaken.</p>
            <p>The greater Part of the City is built upon the Aſcent, and it is very probable that the Caſtle has been the Cauſe of Building the City: For firſt the Neighbours have built a few Houſes near the Caſtle, that under the Reach thereof they might be defended from the Injuries of their Enemies. The Number of the People growing apace, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Houſes likewiſe encreaſed, and ſtretched forth to the very Foot of the Aſcent toward the Eaſt; by which the City, together with the Suburbs of the <hi>Canon-gate</hi> and King's Palace, is become one entire <hi>Scotch</hi> Mile in length; but in breadth it is leſs by the half, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Suburbs be included. The High Street from the Caſtle to the Abbey is adorned with ſtately Buildings, which are of late made of hewen Stone, ſince that by an Act of the Town-Council it hath been prohibited (for the frequent burnings which happened) to build any more Timber-Houſes either in the City or Suburbs.</p>
            <p>The great Breadth of the High Street, and of the many Lanes which lie on each ſide the ſame, from the North to the South (which ſend up the Air as it were in Pipes into the High Street) and the Nearneſs of the two Hills called <hi>Neils Craigs</hi> on the North, and <hi>Sarisbury Craigs</hi> on the South, do always refreſh the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62127:8"/>
Town with Air; which conduces not a little to the Wholeſomeneſs hereof, and it was never heard that the Plague raged in it, except brought in thither by infected Wares. Which Purity of the Air is daily encreaſed ſince the Time that excellent freſh Water was brought into the City from a Fountain three Miles diſtant from the ſame, and that by a moſt wiſe Act of the Council all Naſtineſs is removed.</p>
            <p>The City is encloſed with a kind of an Old <hi>Roman</hi> Wall on every ſide, except towards the North, where the <hi>North-Loch</hi> does ſecure it inſtead of a Wall.</p>
            <p>The City is entered by ſix Gates or Ports: Two of which are to the Eaſt, two to the South, one to the Weſt, and one lately made to the North.</p>
            <p>One of the Gates to the Eaſt is called the <hi>Netherbow,</hi> which in the Year 1616, was magnificently rebuilt, being the chief Gate of the City, adorned with Towers on both ſides.</p>
            <p>The other Gate to the Eaſt is called the <hi>Cowgate Port,</hi> through which there is an Entry into the Nether Street, of the length of the whole City, and is called the <hi>Cowgate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Eaſtmoſt of theſe Gates to the South (through which is an Entry into the City) is called the <hi>Potter-Row Port,</hi> from the Suburb called the <hi>Potter-Row.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Weſtmoſt of theſe is called the <hi>Society Port,</hi> properly the <hi>Brewer</hi>'s <hi>Port.</hi> They have a great ſquare Court in that Place, with Buildings and brave Houſes round about it, to the very Walls of the City.</p>
            <p>The Weſt-Gate at the other End of the City, lying beneath the Caſtle, affords an Entry from the Suburb of the ſame Name.</p>
            <p>The North-Gate, which was laſt made at the Lower End of the <hi>North-Loch,</hi> is twofold, the Inner and the Outer Port, through which there is an Entry into the City from the Suburb called the <hi>Mutter</hi>'s <hi>Hill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two Streets extending the whole length of the Town. The chief Street which is alſo called the Higher, is one of the broadeſt in <hi>Europe</hi>: From it there run many Lanes on both ſides. The Nether or Lower Street hath alſo many Lanes running to the South.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62127:8"/>In the very middle of the City there is a Cathedral Church, which is called St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Church, of ſuch Largeneſs that it is divided into three Churches, every one of which has its own Pariſh. It is built of hewen Stone, adorned with Pillars and <hi>Vaultings</hi> of Stone. In the middle it forms a perfect Croſs, by four Parts of this Church meeting together, and they ſupport a ſtately, high Tower, with a Top of curious Workman-ſhip, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting an Imperial Crown.

            </p>
            <p>There is alſo a Church of ſquare hewen Stone with a Tower built in the Year 1641, which is called the <hi>Trone</hi>-Church.</p>

            <p>Near to this Church is the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in which the poorer ſort of Inhabitants, both Men and Women, are maintained ſplendidly enough, and have their own proper Chaplain.</p>
            <p>Over-againſt this Church is the <hi>Correction-Houſe,</hi> commonly called <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Work,</hi> in which there are divers Manufacturies of Linen, Wooll and Silk, where diſſolute Perſons are forced to earn their Living with their Labour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lady Yeſter</hi>'s Church, was built by one of the Lady <hi>Yeſters,</hi> who alſo left a Summ of Money for maintaining a good and able Man to preach and perform Divine Service therein.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe Churches there are two Chapels in the City, that of St. <hi>Magdalen</hi>'s in the <hi>Cowgate,</hi> and St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s in <hi>Nedries Wind.</hi> There is another Chapel of the ſame Name at the Foot of the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Gate</hi>; as likewiſe ſeveral <hi>Meeting-Houſes</hi> lately built, both in the City and Suburbs.</p>

            <p>In <hi>Gray</hi>'s <hi>Cloſe</hi> near the <hi>Netherbow,</hi> is the <hi>Mint-Houſe,</hi> with a large Court, adorned with moſt neat and convenient Buildings, for Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of the Over-ſeers and Work-men thereunto belonging.</p>
            <p>Upon the South-ſide is the College of King <hi>James</hi> the VI. founded in the Year 1580, endowed with all the Privileges of an Univerſity. It hath moſt large Precincts incloſed with Walls and divided into Three Courts, Two Lower and One Higher, which is equal to both the other in Largeneſs. Theſe Courts or <hi>Area's</hi> are adorned on all ſides with excellent Buildings. There is alſo a high Tower built over the great Entry.</p>
            <p>The publick Schools are large.

The Entry to the Caſtle is from the Town. The chief Defence on this ſide is of the round Battery; at the Foot of which there is a deſigned Out-work, which is not yet brought to a Condition of Defence, and will add very much to the Strength of it when finiſhed. In the Caſtle alſo is a Royal Palace of hewen Stone, where the <hi>Regalia</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are kept. This Caſtle is the Chief Magazine for the Arms and Ammunition of the Nation, and hath a moſt pleaſant Proſpect to the neighbouring Fields, and to the River of <hi>Forth,</hi> from whence it is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by ſuch Ships of War as come to an Anchor in <hi>Leith</hi> Road.

               <hi>Heriot</hi>'s <hi>Hoſpital</hi> is likewiſe within the City, Situated to the Weſt of the publick Burial-Place. It is a Nurſery for Boys, in which the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens Children who are poor, are brought up, under the Tutelage of a Governour, who, according to the Conſtitution of the Founder, is to live Single. They have likewiſe a Chaplain to inſtruct them in the Grounds of Learning, till they be fitted for the publick Schools and Colleges.</p>
            <p>This Hoſpital was founded by <hi>George Heriot,</hi> Jeweller to King <hi>James</hi> the VI. who was deſcended of the Family of <hi>Trebroun</hi>; and after he had loſt two Sons by Shipwrack going from <hi>Scotland</hi> for <hi>London,</hi> where dying without Iſſue, <hi>February</hi> the 15<hi>th.</hi> 1624. he left in Legacy to this Hoſpital Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds <hi>Scots</hi> Money, that Youth might be maintain'd therein, and inſtructed in Arts and Sciences till they were of mature Age, having left the City of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> his Executors.</p>
            <p>This Fabrick is ſtately like a Palace, the Statue of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being erected upon the inner Frontiſpiece. Round about the Houſes are moſt pleaſant Gardens adorned with large Walks and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Greens.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62127:10"/>Without the Walls of the City are the Suburbs, amongſt which that which lies from the <hi>Netherbow</hi> to the Abbey, called the <hi>Cannon-gate,</hi> hath the Preheminence. It is adorned with goodly Buildings and fine Gardens. Upon the North-ſide of it is the <hi>Tolbooth,</hi> where the Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs of the ſame do convene for the Adminiſtration of Juſtice. On the South-ſide is a very fine Houſe belonging to the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> with very pleaſant Gardens adjoining.</p>
            <p>At the Lower End of this Suburb is the Abbey of <hi>Holyrood-Houſe,</hi> founded by King <hi>David</hi> for the Monks of the Order of St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> This was conſumed by Fire, and the Church only remains, in which divers of our Kings and Queens are interred.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Royal Palace</hi> hath four Courts. The Outer Court, which is as big as all the reſt, hath four Principal Entries (beſides ſeveral Inlets into the adjacent Gardens) three of which are on the Weſt, and the other on the Eaſt-ſide.</p>
            <p>The Entry of the Palace is adorned with great Pillars of hewen Stone, and a fine Cupola in Faſhion of a Crown above it. The Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part of the Palace is terminated by four high Towers, Two of which toward the North were erected by King <hi>James</hi> the V. and the reſt by King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. The Fabrick of the Inner-Court is very ſtately, with <hi>Piazza's</hi> round about it, all of fine hewen Stone. From theſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Walks you have Acceſs to the ſeveral Apartments which are moſt Royal and Magnificent. But above all the long Gallery is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, being adorn'd with the Pictures of all the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> from <hi>Fergus</hi> I.</p>
            <p>The Palace on all Hands is bounded with lovely Gardens. On the South lies the King's Park, which hath great Variety of medicinal Plants. Here alſo is an admirable Fountain, which through Conduits ſerves the whole Houſe. His Grace the Duke of <hi>Hamilton</hi> is hereditary Keeper of this Palace.</p>

            <p>The Town is ſituate in a Plain on the Bank of the River <hi>Levin,</hi> near the Place where it enters into <hi>Clyde,</hi> a little below the Caſtle, which is excellently fortified by Nature, owing little to Art; and ſeems to have been built by the Ancient <hi>Brigantes.</hi> This Town had its Privileges procured to it by One of the Counteſſes of <hi>Lennox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſtle hath a ſtrange kind of Situation; for where the Waters of <hi>Clyde</hi> and <hi>Levin</hi> meet, there's a Plain extended to the length of a Mile at the Foot of the neighbouring Hills: And in the very Corner of this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there riſes a Rock with two Tops, the higher of which looks to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62127:12"/>
the Weſt, with a Watch-Tower on the Top of it, having a large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect on all Sides. The other being a little lower lies to the Eaſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two Tops are Steps hewen out of the Rock with great Pains and Labour, which yield Paſſage only to one Perſon at a Time, to the upper Part of the Caſtle. To the South where <hi>Clyde</hi> runs by the Rock which is naturally ſteep, it hath a little Deſcent, and as it were with out-ſtretcht Arms embraces the plain Ground; which partly by Nature and partly by Art is ſo encloſed, that it furniſhes Room for ſeveral Houſes and a Garden. It ſecures the Harbour by its Ordnance, and obliges the ſmaller Boats to come up almoſt to the very Gate of the Caſtle, the Chanal of the River running on that Side. The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Rock where the Entry to the Caſtle is, being built up with Houſes, makes as it were another Caſtle diſtinct from the former. This Caſtle, as appears by its Proſpects, does almoſt ſtand like a Sugar-loaf upon a plain Ground. The Circumference of it is but very ſmall, and yet it hath at the Top a little kind of a Lake and ſeveral other Springs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the natural Fortification, it is bounded on the Weſt by the Water of <hi>Levin,</hi> and on the South by <hi>Clyde,</hi> which are to it inſtead of Ditches. To the Eaſt, the Sea at a full Tide beats againſt the Foot of the Rock; and when it ebbs it does not leave a Plain of Sand, but of a ſoft Clay, which is divided by a Rivulet that runs down from the neighbouring Hills.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>STIRLING</hi> is the Chief Town of the Shire of that Name, where the Sheriff keeps his Courts. It hath its Name from its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the Town ſtands upon the Deſcent of a ſteep Rock, at the Foot of which there runs a deep River call'd <hi>Boderia</hi> or <hi>Forth.</hi> It takes its Name from the <hi>Saxon</hi> Word <hi>Ster,</hi> which ſignifies a Hill, and <hi>Lin</hi> a Water.</p>
            <p>It was of old called <hi>Binobara,</hi> which by ſome is judged to be <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>'s <hi>Vindovara</hi>: For <hi>Bin</hi> in our old Language ſignifies a Hill, and <hi>Vara</hi> a River: So that the Name which the Town now retains, is the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the old Name thereof.</p>
            <p>At the Head of the Town ſtands a well fortified Caſtle, adorned with ſtately Buildings in the former Age, by King <hi>James</hi> the V. This is the Place, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerves, where <hi>Clyde</hi> and <hi>Forth</hi> being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back divide from one another. For a great way they are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a ſmall Neck of Land, which was then ſtrengthned by a Garriſon; and all that <hi>Iſthmus</hi> was poſſeſſed by Soldiers, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being removed as it were into another Iſland, the Inſcription

            <p>The King's Park lies at the very Foot of the Caſtle, and the City ſtands on the Back of a Hill toward the South. It is encloſed with a Wall, and toward the North, it is bounded with the River <hi>Forth,</hi> which croſſed by a Bridge in that Place.</p>
            <p>The Bridge is of hewen Stone, and fortified with an Iron-Gate. It conſiſts of four ſtately Arches, and lies South and North.</p>
            <p>The Ships at full Tide come up to the Bridge, and the Haven is a little below the ſame.</p>
            <p>The Church, which is of hewen Stone built very artificially, ſtands in the Upper Part of the Town toward the Eaſt, adorned with a very high Tower.</p>
            <p>Not far from the Church may be ſeen the Manſions of the Earls of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Marr,</hi> notable both for their Bigneſs and Artifice of their Structure.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Marr</hi> is Governour of this Caſtle by Heritage. It hath a competent Number of Great Ordnance, for defending the Paſſage of the Bridge, and a ſufficient Garriſon eſtabliſhed for its Security.</p>
            <p>In times of Trouble the Chief Magazine of the Nation is uſually tranſported to this Place, it lying upon a conſiderable Paſs, and almoſt in the Center of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>As this City ſtands in a moſt commodious Place for Commerce, ſo it hath a moſt delectable and pleaſant Proſpect, by the great and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Windings of the River <hi>Forth,</hi> which are ſo extraordinary, that from the Bridge of <hi>Stirling</hi> to the Town of <hi>Allowa,</hi> it is 24 Miles by Water, and but 4 by Land.</p>

            <p>SAINT <hi>ANDREWS,</hi> in Latin, <hi>Andreanopolis,</hi> or <hi>Fanum Sancti Andreae,</hi> has its Name from St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> whoſe Bones are ſaid to be brought hither from <hi>Patras,</hi> a Town in <hi>Pelopon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſus,</hi> by <hi>Regulus</hi> a <hi>Grecian</hi> Monk, <hi>Anno</hi> 368. a Man in that Age much eſteem'd for Piety, as appears by the Church dedicated to him, and called after his Name. From him alſo (as ancient Writers report) this Town was at firſt called <hi>Regimund,</hi> that is, <hi>Mons ſancti Reguli</hi>; for we read that <hi>Oengus,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngus,</hi> King of the <hi>Picts,</hi> did grant to <hi>God</hi> and Saint <hi>Andrew,</hi> That he ſhould be Head of all Churches within the Jurisſdiction of the <hi>Picts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe it is manifeſt from Old Manuſcripts, that this was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal See of the <hi>Culdai,</hi> who had the care and management of Holy Things from the firſt reception of Chriſtianity in thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>This City is the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the whole Kingdom, and the See of an Archbiſhop, who is Primate of all <hi>Scotland.</hi> It lies towards the Eaſt with a pleaſant Proſpect to the Ocean, having a Harbour for Ships, the Sea
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62127:16"/>
near it plentiful in Fiſhes, and Fields wholeſome and ſpacious.</p>
            <p>There yet remain the Marks of Venerable Antiquity, the Ruines of the Cathedral Church and Monaſtery, which do abundantly teſtifie their Ancient Glory and Magnificence. The Town it ſelf is ſituate in a Plain, from Eaſt to Weſt, with a moſt pleaſant Proſpect to the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Ocean. It had a very ſtrong Caſtle of Old, whoſe Rubbiſh and Ruines are yet to be ſeen upon the Rocks on the Sea-ſide towards the North. It has Streets ſtraight and broad, ſtretching Eaſt and Weſt, whereof two lead to that once famous Abbey of <hi>Canons Regular</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſituate toward the Eaſt and South-Eaſt, the Wall ſurrounding this Abbey being yet intire, and of hewen Stone, with many Towers and Turrets which give it the Reſemblance of a King's Palace.</p>
            <p>The Chief Church in the Town now, is that called the <hi>New Church,</hi> not far from the <hi>New College.</hi> In it there is to be ſeen a very Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Monument of Archbiſhop <hi>Sharp.</hi>

            <p>There is alſo another Church called St. <hi>Leonard</hi>'s adjacent to a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the ſame Name, the Rector whereof is ordinarily the Principal of the ſaid College; but the greateſt Ornament of the City is the Univerſity, the <hi>Athens</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> conſiſting at preſent of Three Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges; and was firſt founded by <hi>Laurentius Lindoris,</hi> and <hi>Richardus Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellus,</hi> Doctors of Law, and publick Profeſſors of Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>The College of St. <hi>Salvator,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Old College,</hi> was founded by <hi>James Kennedie</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> together with a Church beautified with an high towering Steeple all of hewen Stone, in which his Monument of curious Workman-ſhip is yet to be ſeen. Mr. <hi>Skene</hi> Doctor of Divinity and Principal of the College, has of late repaired and augmented the Fabrick thereof, having made a Collection for that end. He has alſo founded a <hi>Library,</hi> which by the Donations of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men is now very well furniſhed with good Books.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Leonard</hi>'s College was founded by <hi>James Hepburn,</hi> Prior of St. <hi>Andrews</hi>; in which are ſeveral Profeſſors, as firſt the Principal, who is always Doctor of Divinity, and Four Profeſſors of Philoſophy, to whom <hi>John Scot</hi> of <hi>Scots Tarvett</hi> Knight, added a Profeſſor of Philology, with a liberal Salary, and augmented the Library with the Gift of ſeveral conſiderable Volumes.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe of late very much increaſed by Sir <hi>John Wedderburne,</hi> Doctor of Phyſick, who dying left his great Collection of Books to

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>New College</hi> was founded by <hi>James Beaton</hi> Archbiſhop. In it are two Profeſſors, always Doctors in Divinity, the One ſtiled <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Profeſſor of Theology,</hi> the Other only <hi>Profeſſor of Theology</hi>; to which of late is added a Profeſſor of Mathematicks; the firſt Profeſſor whereof, Mr. <hi>James Gregory,</hi> erected a Commodious Obſervatory for Mathematical Obſervations in the College Garden, having caus'd a Contribution to be made for that Purpoſe. He alſo furniſhed it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mathematical Inſtruments much better than it had before his Time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> the I.

In the very middle of the City is the <hi>Tolbooth,</hi> magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently built of hewen Stone, with a very high Tower, and Bells which ſound melodiouſly at every Hour's end. At the <hi>Tolbooth</hi> Four princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Streets croſſing each other do divide the City as it were into Four equal Parts, every one of which is adorned with ſeveral publick Buildings.</p>
            <p>In the higher Part of the City the Cathedral Church ſtands, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called St. <hi>Mungo</hi>'s. It amazes the Eyes of the Beholders for its ſtupendious Bigneſs, and Artifice of its Structure. It conſiſts of two Churches, of which the one is over the other. The ſeveral Rows of Pillars, and exceeding high Towers, do ſhow a wonderful piece of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture.</p>
            <p>Near to the Church is the Archbiſhop's Caſtle, fenced with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high Wall of hewen Stone, and looks down to the City; but the chief Ornament of the City is the College which was founded by King <hi>James</hi> the II. Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the V. granting an Indulgence, and confirming it by his Bull to have the Rights and Liberties of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, where general Learning ſhould be taught. It was erected by the great Labour and Expences of that Reverend Prelate <hi>William Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Words of the Bull for the founding of it, are, That general Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould flouriſh in the ſame, as well in Theology, and the Canon and Civil Law, as in all other Arts and Faculties; and that the Maſters and Teachers there ſhould enjoy all and ſundry the Privileges, Liberties, Honours, Immunities and Exemptions which have been granted by the Apoſtolick See, or others, any other way, to the Maſters, Teachers, or Students of our College at <hi>Bononia.</hi> The Fabrick of the College is remarkable, conſiſting of divers Courts. The fore-part of it towards the City is of an excellent Structure being of hewen Stone. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of the College are enlarged by ſome Acres of Ground, purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſome Money granted to it of late by the King and Eſtates of the Kingdom. It is ſeparated from the reſt of the Town by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high Wall.</p>

               <head> Old ABERDEEN.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>ABERDEEN</hi> the Old is ſituated a Mile to the North of the New Town, commonly called <hi>Bon-accord,</hi> it hath its Name from its Situation, being placed at the Mouth of the Water of <hi>Don.</hi> The Name of the River ſufficiently ſhews that the <hi>Picts</hi> who inhabited this part of the Country were of a <hi>Scythian</hi> Deſcent, for the River which by the <hi>Latins</hi> is called <hi>Danubius,</hi> by the <hi>Germans</hi> is called <hi>Dunave,</hi> by the <hi>Polonians Dunaum,</hi> by the <hi>Turks Tuna,</hi> being of the very ſame Name with our <hi>Don.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The River is remarkable for the Multitude of Salmon and Perches which are taken in it. About half a Mile from Old <hi>Aberdeen</hi> it hath a Bridge of one ſingle Arch, which is both large and ſtately, it is made up for the moſt part of ſquare hewen Stone, both the Ends of it being fixed on Rocks. By its crooked winding it breaks the force of the Stream, ſo that Nature it ſelf ſeems to have made way for its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A little below it <hi>Don</hi> enters into the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:62127:21"/>Above the Bridge two Miles, is a heap of Stone artificially caſt in the Mouth of the Chanal for the eaſier catching of the Salmon. It is the Biſhops Seat, and hath a Cathedral Church commonly called St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chars,</hi> of a large and ſtately Structure; being built of hewn Stone by the ſeveral Biſhops of that See. It anciently conſiſted of two Ranks of Stone Pillars, another croſs Church and three Turrets, the greateſt of which, was the Steeple, which was ſet upon Four Pillars of vaulted Works. In the Church likewiſe was a Library, but about the Year 1560 it was almoſt wholly deſtroyed, ſo that the Ruines do now only remain.</p>
               <p>But the Chief Ornament of this Town is the King's College, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the South ſide of the Town, conſpicuous beyond the reſt of the Houſes for the Neatneſs and Statelineſs of its Structure. 'Tis In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to no College in <hi>Scotland.</hi> One ſide of it is covered with Slate, the reſt with Lead; the Church, and Turret or Steeple are of hewen Stone. The Windows were of old remarkable for painted Glaſs, and ſome reliques of their ancient Splendor do yet remain. Here is a fine Monument of Biſhop <hi>Elphingſton.</hi> The Steeple beſides others hath two Bells of an extraordinary Bigneſs. The Top of it is vaulted with a double croſs Arch, above which is a King's Crown, having eight Corners upheld by as many Pillars of Stone, a round Globe of Stone with two gilded Croſſes cloſing the Crown. In the Year 1631 it was overturned by a Storm, but ſhortly after was built in a more ſtately Form. It was begun by Biſhop <hi>Forbes,</hi> continued by <hi>William Gourdon</hi> Dr. of Phyſick, and helped on by the largeſſes of ſeveral Noblemen and Gentlemen of that Country. Cloſe to the Church there is a Library provided with many Books, much enriched by thoſe which Dr. <hi>Henry Scougal,</hi> Profeſſor of Divinity there, and the Right Reverend Dr. <hi>Patr. Scougal,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> his Father, did lately bequeath to it.</p>
               <p>This College was Founded by Biſhop <hi>Elphingſton, Anno Dom.</hi> 1500. and the greateſt part of the Work was likewiſe Built by him; but King <hi>James</hi> the IV. aſſumed the Patronage of it to himſelf, whence it is called the King's College. In it there is a Primar or Principal, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of Theology, a Profeſſor of the Civil Law, a Profeſſor of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, a Sub-Principal, who is alſo a Profeſſor of Philoſophy, three other Philoſophy Profeſſors, and a Profeſſor of the Languages. This College and that in the New Town make up one Univerſity, called the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of King <hi>Charles.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>ABERDEEN,</hi> as I have ſaid, is twofold, the New Town and the Old. They are diſtant the one from the other about a Mile. <hi>Abredonia</hi> ſeems to be the ſame which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> calls the City <hi>Devana,</hi> placed in the Province called <hi>Texale,</hi> upon the mouth of the River <hi>Dee</hi>; for <hi>Aber</hi> in the old <hi>Britiſh</hi> Tongue ſignifies or denotes the mouth of a River, and <hi>Deva,</hi> or <hi>Dee,</hi> is the name of the River upon whoſe mouth this City is ſituated. But New <hi>Aberdeen</hi> is the Capital of the Sheriff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and the Seat of the Sheriff for Trial of Cauſes. It is placed at the Eaſtern Corner of the Shire, where it is waſh'd with the <hi>German</hi> Sea. This City very much exceeds the reſt of the Cities of the North of <hi>Scotland</hi> in Bigneſs, greatneſs of Traffick, and Beauty; it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a wholeſome Air, and abounds with well-bred Inhabitants, and has a great Revenue from its Salmon fiſhing. The Old City ſeems to have been placed upon a Bank of the Sea; becauſe it is the common Opinion that the Monaſtery of the Holy Trinity which is thought to have been formerly the Palace of King <hi>William,</hi> is ſituate in the very Creek of that Sea, and not far from it are the Ruins of an old <hi>Praetorium.</hi> In tract of time the Inhabitants ſeem to have filled ſeveral neighbouring little Hills with Houſes, and now the City is chiefly built upon Three of thoſe Hills, and the greateſt part upon the higheſt. It hath an acceſs by an aſcent every way. The exteriour parts thereof are ſpread out upon the Plain, as Suburbs in many places.</p>
               <p>That there was a Mint heretofore in the City, appears by Silver Coyns there ſtamped with this Inſcription, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbs Aberdeae,</hi> which are yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Cloſets of the curious.</p>
               <p>The Streets are Paved with Flint, or a very hard Stone reſembling Flint; the Houſes beautiful both within and without, are Four Stories high, or more, and have for the moſt part Gardens and Orchards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them; ſo that the whole City, to thoſe that approach it, gives the reſemblance of a Wood.</p>
               <p>At the Weſt-End of the City, a little round Hill adjoyning offers it ſelf to ſight, from the foot of which Hill breaks forth a Fountain of clear Water, and in the middle of the ſame, another Spring flowing down to the foot of the Hill, bubbles out, and ſends forth a Stream as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62127:22"/>
rapid as a Torrent, but the ſpring it ſelf is eaſily diſtinguiſh'd both in Colour and Taſte from a Torrent. It is called the <hi>Aberdonian</hi> Spaw, becauſe both in Taſte and Quality it comes very near to the Spaw Water in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Liege.</hi> This Water is cold to the touch. Doctor <hi>William Barclay</hi> a Phyſician, has written a Treatiſe concerning it.</p>
               <p>In the High Street there is a Church of the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> worthy to be taken notice of, built of Free-Stone; a Work begun by Doctor <hi>William Elphingſton,</hi> then Biſhop, and finiſhed at the charge of <hi>Gavinus Dumbar,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> about the Year of Chriſt 1500.</p>
               <p>The ſaid Biſhop <hi>Gavinus Dumbar,</hi> hath alſo got himſelf immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Honour, by a Famous Bridge of ſeven Arches laid over the River <hi>Dee,</hi> about a Mile from the City, built very firm and durable, of Free-Stone, which in more places than one by Inſcription teſtifies its Author or Builder.</p>
               <p>But the great Ornament of the City is its College, called the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhallian Academy,</hi> as founded by the Earl Marſhal, <hi>George Keith,</hi> in the Year 1593, which the City of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> hath very much adorned with ſeveral additional Buildings. It has, beſides a Primary Profeſſor, who is called Principal, Four Profeſſors of Philoſophy, a Profeſſor of Theology, and a Profeſſor of the Mathematicks. There is alſo a famous Library Founded by the City of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> ſupplied by the Gifts of Learned Men, and furniſhed with divers Mathematical Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Add to theſe the School-Houſe, Founded by Dr. <hi>Dune,</hi> which has one Head Maſter, and three Uſhers under him. There is alſo a School for Muſick.</p>
               <p>The Cathedral Church nominated from St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> its Patron, is built of Free-Stone and covered with Lead; has a Steeple reſembling a Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid, and covered likewiſe with ſheets of Lead to a conſiderable heighth. It was divided formerly into Three Churches, the bigeſt whereof was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Old Church, the other the New Church, and the third the Arched, named the Arch of the Lady of Mercy. This Cathedral is propt with Pillars of Free-Stone, and has Three Bells of a vaſt weight, which by their quick and continual Sounds divide the half Hours. The body of this Church is adorned with a Tower and pinacled Steeple. Here is kept the Court for the publick Trials of the Townſmen, and the County Courts, where is alſo a Priſon and a Work-Houſe. Beſides theſe there is an Alms-Houſe for the maintenance of the Old People of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> that are come to Decay, with Three Hoſpitals Founded by ſeveral perſons. And adjoyning to the Cuſtom-Houſe lies the Port or Wharf.</p>

The moſt curious Part of the Building is the Vault of the Quire, and that which is called the Prince's Pillar ſo much talk'd of. This Chapel was poſſeſs'd by a Provoſt, and Seven Canons Regular, who were endued with ſeveral conſiderable Revenues through the Liberality of the Lairds of <hi>Roſlin.</hi>
