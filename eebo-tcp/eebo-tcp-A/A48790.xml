         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the
RIGHT HONOURABLE
Sir Henry Bennet,
LORD ARLINGTON,
Principal Secretary of State to His Majesty, and
one of the Lords of His Majesties most Honourable
PRIVY COUNCIL.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it please your Honour,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN this Collection (which is humbly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
to your Lordship, as one of the
most eminent surviving Instances of
that Loyalty it treats of) is contained
Remarques and Observations upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a thousand Persons, in which
number may be accounted no less than
two hundred Peers and Prelates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the Excellency of that Royal Cause, most Sacred
in the two Branches thereof, <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Slave in the Historian, gathered up the scattered
Limbs of his Great, but Conquered and Murthered
Lords, burning them on some vulgar pile, and repositing
their Ashes in some poor room, till more equal times
should erect them a becoming Monument; <hi>Covering them
with a Pyramid, or inclosing them in a Temple:</hi> So I, from
the perishing and scattered Pamphlets and Discourses of
<pb facs="tcp:59370:3"/>
these times, have Collected some choice Memorials of
those <hi>Heroes,</hi> who deserved not to be forgotten in that
Kingdom, whereof I am a Subject, and that Church,
whereof I am a Member; which Collection may serve for
a just, though brief account, of the great actions and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of these Worthies, till time shall produce a better
History, more lasting than its self, that shall be a reproach
to the weakness of Stone and Marble.</p>
            <p>History, (saith my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>) which may be called
just and perfect History, is of three kinds, according to
the object it propoundeth, or pretendeth to represent; for
it either representeth a time, a person, or an action. The
first we call <hi>Chronicles,</hi> the second <hi>Lives,</hi> and the third
<hi>Narrations,</hi> or <hi>Relations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of these, although the first be the most compleat and
absolute kind of History, and hath most estimation and
glory; yet the second excelleth it in profit and use, and
the third in verity and sincerity. For History of Times
representeth the magnitude of Actions, and the publick
faces and deportments of Persons, and passeth over in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
the smaller passages and motions of men and matters.
But such being the Workmanship of God, as he doth hang
the greater weights upon the smallest wyars, <hi>Maxima e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minimis
suspendens,</hi> It comes therefore to pass, that such
Histories do rather set forth the pomp of business, than the
true and inward resorts thereof. But Lives, if well writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
propounding to themselves a Person to represent, in
in whom actions, both greater and smaller, publick and
private, have a commixture, must of necessity contain a
more true, native, and lively representation.</p>
            <p>I do much admire, that the vertues of our late times
should be so little esteemed, as that the writing of Lives
should be no more frequent; for although there be not
many Soveraign Princes, or absolute Commanders, and
that States are most Collected into Monarchies; yet there
are many worthy Personages, that deserve better than di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
Reports, and barren Elogies.</p>
            <p>There are Pyramids erected for the <hi>Maccabees</hi> (those
great sufferers for a good Cause) at <hi>Modinum</hi> in <hi>Palestine,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59370:3"/>
the bottom of which contain the bodies of those <hi>Heroes,</hi>
and the tops serve for Sea-marks, to direct Marriners,
sayling in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> towards the Haven of <hi>Ioppa,</hi>
in the <hi>Holy-Land;</hi> not unlike whereunto, for the use and
service thereof, is this following Volume, partly to do
justice to those Worthies deceased, and partly to guide
and Conduct their Posterity to the same happiness, by
steering their course according to the honourable patterns
of their Lives, and the resolved manner of their Deaths;
being moreover useful intimations to oppressed vertue,
when neither Law nor Government can neither encourage
or support, and successful and prosperous Vices, which
neither is able either to suppress or restrain; yet is History
able to do Right to the one, and Justice on the other;
History that holds a Pen in one hand, that can set the most
neglected and despicable goodness eternally beyond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
and (being the greatest awe over great Villains on
this side Hell) a scourge in the other, that shall give the
most powerful and domineering Villany perpetual wounds
beyond a remedy; a fair warning to all men, that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sense of fame or honour, to take as great care of their
deportment before their death, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Gladiators
did of their postures before their fall.</p>
            <p>Neither am I without competent hopes, that it will
be a cosiderable pleasure to those worthy Persons still
surviving their former sufferings, to see the Kings friends
in a body in an History, as once they saw them in the
Field; and be able upon the view, to make a judgement
what Families and Persons are fit to be employed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted,
what deserving men have been neglected, and
who may be encouraged and rewarded; without doubt
many will, with great satisfaction, look on this Catalogue
as K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. did on <hi>Essex</hi> his Army at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> when
he gave his reason for his long looking upon them, to one
that asked him, What he meant to do; <hi>This is the first
time that I saw them in a body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the rather, because, though not mentioned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as being alive, (<hi>Nec tanti est ut memorentur perire,</hi>
Nor is it worth their while to dye, that they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred)
<pb facs="tcp:59370:4"/>
yet by this poor attempt may guess, that
when other means prove ineffectual, (Monuments of
Wood being subject to burning, of Glass to breaking, of
soft Stone to mouldring, of Marble and Mettal to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing)
their own Vertues, and others Writings, will
Eternize them.</p>
            <p>If any Persons are omitted (as possibly, in so great a
variety, there may be some) or mistaken, or but briefly
mentioned, be it considered, that the Press, like Time
and Tide, staying for no man, and real Informations
(though diligently and importunately sought after) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
in but slowly, we were forced to lay this Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and intend, God willing, if an opportunity shall
serve, to compleat, or at least more amply adorn the
Structure.</p>
            <p>One of the greatest Encouragements whereunto, will
be your Lordships gracious acceptance of this weak, but
sincere Endeavour of,</p>

            <head>PREPARATIVES
TO
The last Civil War,
From 1550 to 1640.</head>
            <p>AS in Nature there is hardly a Poyson growing any
where, but in the same place there groweth an
Antidote against it; so in Nations, seldome do
the loose principles of Licentiousness, Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Disorder prevail so universally, but
that in the same Nation the more excellent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Reason, Religion, Laws, and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,
bear up against them. Various have been the shapes and
pretences, under which the <hi>Lusts</hi> of men (for all the disorders in the
world, are nothing else but <hi>Lust,</hi> casting off the restraint God hath
laid upon it by Government) have indeavoured (since God set up
Government to keep men civil and quiet in <hi>this world,</hi> as he did
Religion to prepare them for <hi>another world</hi>) to shake and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate
the obligations both of Religion and Government in all
places of the world (for most pretences last but an Age, in which
time they are looked through, exploded, abhorred, and must be
<hi>shifted.</hi>)</p>
            <p>How men willing to live at the highest freedom of a loose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
have in this Nation endeavoured in several generations to
overthrow all the Checks, Restraints, Rules, and Disciplines of
Religion, is not so properly the business of this place, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
the subject of every discourse elswhere.</p>
            <p>The pretentions and appearances under which those that have
made a pretty good shift to suppress all those Principles of Honesty,
Sobriety and Obedience that Religion curbed them withal within,
would likewise in this Nation over-rule all Power, Authority,
Order and Laws, that keep them within compass from without,
when those unruly <hi>Lusts,</hi> Pride, Ambition, Animosity, Discontent,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59370:9"/>
Popularity, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would over-run all those Banks that
were raised against them; have been</p>
            <p>1. The Dubiousness of the Royal Title, the ground of thirty
six Rebellions, one hundred forty six Battle since the Conquest:
In all which though the Rebels were usually the <hi>most,</hi> the Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
were always the <hi>best:</hi> and when the <hi>many</hi> followed sometimes
a prosperous Villany, the most noble and excellent stood to, or
fell with an afflicted right, and bore down all umbrages with this
real truth, That the Crown took off all defects, and that any man
may pretend arguments to begin a War, when but few can make
arguments, when it is begun, to make an end of it.</p>
            <p>2. The Liberty of the Subject, forsooth, the old Quarrel for
which the Throng and Rabble would venture much, when wiser
men maintained, that there was no greater oppression in the world,
than a Liberty for men to do what they pleased; and that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the great security of freedome.</p>
            <p>3. Religion, for whose sake so many <hi>resisted</hi> Authority, when
one of the Maximes of this Religion is, that none should <hi>resist</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pain of damnation: and albeit the Factious in all Ages have
been many, that have taught men for Religions sake to disobey
Authority; yet the sober in those Ages have been as many, that
taught them, that for Religion-sake they should obey them that
have the rule over them.</p>
            <p>But when towards the last, that is, the <hi>worst</hi> Ages of the world,
wickedness grows wiser upon the experiences and observations of
former times, and twists all these pretensions into one; there have
been excellent persons that with their lives and fortunes asserted
Government, and have been Confessors and Martyrs to this great
truth, <hi>That it is upon no pretence law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi> to resist the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a Nation: a truth that keeps up the world, without
which it had been long ere this a desolation.</p>
            <p>Upon the Reformation in <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth's time, it fell out in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as <hi>Luther</hi> observes it did in most other reformed Churches, that
the Papists finding that their way was so odious, that it was to no
purpose for it to appear here with open face to settle it self, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did they under several covert pretexts and cunning scruples,
endeavour to unsettle all other ways; and when it could not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
it self, to hinder all other Professions from being establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that at least they might watch some opportunities, whereof
there are many offered in distracted times. For no sooner was our
Church setled on the Primitive principles of Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than some of those that fled into the free States, and the places
of popular reformation in <hi>Germany,</hi> returning when most prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were gone, and living upon the Liberality of well-disposed
People, set up some popular scruples against the established Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:<note place="margin">A. E. 6. 4. 1550.</note>
and among the rest, <hi>Iohn Hooper</hi> having been long in
<hi>Switzerland,</hi> upon his election to be Bishop of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> scrupled
several Ornaments and Rights of our Church; the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi>
afterwards Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (having a design to oblige
all Parties in order to a project he had set up to convey the Crown
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59370:9"/>
to his own family, to preserve the Reformation, though he died a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist)
writes to Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> to dispence with the publick
Laws, to satisfie a private mans humor; and when his Letter would
not do, makes the young King write another: and now <hi>Cranmer</hi>
and <hi>Ridley</hi> stand up for these great Principles of Government: <hi>Let
private Spirits yeild to publick establishments: there is no end of yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to scruples, one scruple indulged begetting another, so long, till there
be no more Law than pleaseth the humoursome: be well advised in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Laws, and resolute in keeping them.</hi> Notwithstanding that the
learned and wise <hi>Ridley</hi> suffered almost as much for his asserting the
Government of our Church at that rate from the Puritans, as he
did afterwards for asserting the Doctrine of it, from the Papists: he
was Martyr to the Protestant Church, and a Confessor to the
Church of <hi>England; Hooper</hi> not being reconciled to him until the
Sun of their lives was going down; and their heart-burning upon
this occasion was not quenched,<note place="margin">A. Ed. 6. 7. 1553.</note> till the Fire was kindled that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both their bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord Admiral</hi> Seymour <hi>was a back-Friend to Common-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and old</hi> Latimer <hi>takes him and others up for it:</hi> I have heard say,
when that the good Queen that is gone, had ordained in her house daily
Prayers, both before noon and afternoon; the Admiral getteth him out of
the way, like a mole digging in the earth: he shall be <hi>Lots</hi> wife to me as
long as I live. He was, I heard say, a covetous man, a covetous man
indeed: I would there were no more in <hi>England.</hi> He was I heard say
a seditious man, a contemner of Common-Prayer: I would there were
no more in <hi>England.</hi> Well! he is gone, I would he had left none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him.</p>
            <p>Yea, when the death of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth put an end to
these differences among Protestants, but putting an end to the
publick profession of the Protestant Religion it self in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
the forementioned scruples accompanied some hot-Spirited
men to their exiles under Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Q. M. 2. 3. 1557/8.</note> When Master <hi>Calvins</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

pleased God that with Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> it was again established and
restored by the Law of the Realm.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign,<note place="margin">Q. El. 1. 1560/1.</note> all persons were
so intent upon obviating the Publick Dangers, that they had no
leasure to minde particular Animosities (though as the <hi>Danow</hi>
and the <hi>Savus</hi> in <hi>Hungary</hi> run with party-colour'd Waters in the
same Channel, so the several sorts of <hi>Protestants</hi> upon that alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

year 1563. when the Canons and Articles of the Church being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,

the Governours of the Church began, as it was their duty,
to press Conformity; and they whom it concerned to oppose that
Establishment refused subscription, Father <hi>Foxe</hi> (as Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>

<hi>He would subscribe to that, and that he had nothing in the Church
save a Prebend of</hi> Salisbury; <hi>and if they would take that away, much
good may it do them. Laurence Humphred</hi> determining something

can they have understanding that work wickedness, spoiling my people,
and that extol vanity?</p>
            <p>Nay, from single Affronts to Government, they proceed to
Conventicles in Fields, Woods, and Friends Houses; and not
onely so, but <hi>Thomas Cartwright</hi> the Bell-weather of Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
presents the Parliament 1572. with a Book called <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,</hi>
a Title not well resented in Parliament, since <hi>Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is but the lowest degree of Ecclesiastical Censure, and a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative,
if neglected, to Suspension and Excommunication;
wherein were several Grievances represented, with this onely
Redress prescribed, <hi>viz. The admission of that Platform which the</hi>
Presbyterians <hi>there exhibited.</hi> And since one modest Admonition
would not do, another more severe followeth, and a Reply to
Doctor <hi>Whitgift</hi>'s Answer to the Admonition, with a world of

the Grievances of Pluralities and Non-residences, Ecclesiastical
Courts and Jurisdictions, to shake the Established Government,
as forced Archbishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> to repair with an humble Petition
to the Queen to stand by her own Authority as Supream in all
Causes and over all Persons, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, in these
her Majesties Realms and Dominions. The Lord <hi>Burleigh</hi> himself
was so importuned by them against our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> that he desired
them to draw up a better; as they had done, but that they could
not agree. Nay, some persons private Interests making use of,
and closing with these Publick Disturbances, the Commons come
up with a sixteen-fold Petition against the Church to the Lords;
and many of the Lords were so high, that nothing would satisfie
my Lord <hi>Grey</hi> less than the turning out of all the Bishops by <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire</hi>
then, as they had been in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time; and
that the Queen should not confer with the Bishops but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Temporal Lords. A bold Proposal, as an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Lord then observed, that the Lords should appoint her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty

            <p>And no wonder now, that such Pamphlets, as, <hi>The Epitome, The
Demonstration of Discipline, The Supplication, Diotrephes, The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
Have you any work for the Cooper? Martin Marprelate Senior
and Iunior, Have you any more work for Coopers?</hi> flew abroad so
much, that the Synod at <hi>Coventry</hi> acted so boldly as they did in
their Thirteen Canons, as a man may call them; And that they
began to write to one another in this Style, <hi>We look for Bickering
ere long, and then a Battel which cannot long endure.</hi> A boldness
excusable, when both the Kings of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> interposed
in their behalf: yea, and some of them, as <hi>Hacket</hi> and <hi>Arthington,</hi>
set up Designes to murder the Queen, and the Privy-Council;

out in his Temple-Lectures, to open opposition against Mr. <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
the Master of it, and the great Champion of the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> And because they began to be ashamed to make such
a stir about Rites, Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they added some Sabbatarian
Speculations, and bold Controversies of Gods Decrees, to put
weight into the Quarrel, and brave that the World might take
them not for light Scruplers about indifferent things, but the
strong Astertors of the Power of Godliness, <hi>viz.</hi> in the keeping
of the Sabbath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the design of Dr. <hi>Bounds</hi> Book of the
Sabbath.</p>
            <p>To this heighth the Impugners of Government and Discipline
arrived at in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, in whose Reign these Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
withstood them, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Queen, true to her Motto, <hi>Semper eadem,</hi> would not
either by their Greatness, Number, or Importunity, that maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Faction, be moved to the least diminution of her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59370:11"/>
in Causes Ecclesiastical; yea, and in her latter days, when she
observed how the Church and State was overborn by them, she
grew very severe towards them, as <hi>Vdal, Penry,</hi> and <hi>Cartwright</hi>
felt; <hi>they</hi> at the <hi>Assizes,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> in the Star-Chamber, till he
saved himself by an humble submission.</p>
            <p>2. The Privy-Council always in Church-Affairs (however
some Members of it had a kindness for the Faction) went along
with the Arch-bishop.</p>
            <p>3. The Arch-bishops, <hi>Parker</hi> and <hi>Whitgift,</hi> notwithstanding
the many and great Difficulties they met with, kept up the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Canons, and required subscription.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Fulke, Hooker,</hi> and <hi>Rogers,</hi> kept up the Authority of the
Church in Writing.</p>
            <p>Although the Queen was often by them in danger of her life,
the Arch-bishops made weary of their Lives and Government;
Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was heart-broken with Calumnies and Oppositions;
all the Bishops and Ministers of the Church rendred as odious and
ridiculous as the Wit and Malice of men could make them. The
stout Bishop of <hi>Exeter</hi> went with honourable Scars from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
malicious Tongues and Pens to his Grave.</p>
            <p>Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift</hi> not onely felt the Fury of this Sect, when
Master of <hi>Trinity</hi>-Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> at what time <hi>Carwright</hi>
was also a Member of that House, kept a Fast there in his absence,
and perswaded all the Scholars, but two or three, to throw off
their Surplices, as they did, till the good Master returned home.
Nor did he onely complain of the continual opposition that he
met with, when <hi>Regius Professor,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> at the same
time <hi>Margaret Professor</hi> in the same University; nor of the Indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable
pains he took to answer <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Admonitions to the
Parliament, and to reply to <hi>Cartwrights</hi> Answers, till his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonist
laid down the Cudgels.</p>
            <p>For these were inconsiderable troubles given him, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on the great Oppositions and dangerous Motions in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
that forced him twice on his knees to the Queen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
the continuance of her Grace and Favour towards him
and the Church the first time, and <hi>with grief of heart</hi> (they are
his own words) <hi>craving her Majesties protection</hi> the second: And
add to them the several Contrasts he had with the Lords, by
whom in Councel, upon their sending to him the Complaints of
the <hi>Norfolk</hi>-Ministers against Bishop <hi>Preake</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and of
the <hi>Kentish</hi>-Ministers against himself; he was forced to write, that
it was Irregular for Ministers to address themselves to the Council-Table,
in Affairs of the Church, wherein he alone was Intrusted
by God and her Majesty; and to tell them, that it was not for the
Queen to sit in her Throne, if such men might so boldly offer
themselves to reason and dispute,<note place="margin">1582, 1583,</note> as in their Bill they vaunt,
against the state established in matter of Religion; nor for himself
to keep his place, if every Curate within his Diocess or Province,
may be permitted so to use him; it being impossible, as he saith,
for him to perform the Duty which her Majesty looked for at his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59370:11"/>
hands, if he might not without Interruption, proceed in that
which her <hi>Highness</hi> had especially committed unto him. And
that the disorderly flocking and gadding from place to place
was dangerous; concluding, that the sending for him to appear
before the Council-Table as a Party, and to call his doings in
question (which from her Majesty were immediately committed
unto him, and wherein he supposed he had no other Judge but
her self) and this upon the suggestion of unlearned, despicable,
and troublesome men (the meanest and fewest of the places
where they lived) was a thing unexpected from them, from
whom, as their Pastor, he expected all aid and assistance in his
Office, for the quietness of the Church and State, the Credit of
the established Religion, and the maintenance of the Laws made
for the same</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither was this all; alas, what a sad Complaint doth this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Person make against one</hi> Beal <hi>Clerk of the Council, who
reviled and threatned him to his face, if he proceeded to put the
Ecclesiastical Laws in execution as he had done? telling him
boldly, loudly, and bitterly,</hi> That he would overthrow the Church,
and that his hands should be shortly stopped: <hi>His words are,</hi> That
were it not for his Conscience, and well-grounded perswasion in the
things he did, the peace of the Church, her Majesty, and some Noble
Lords constancy to him in the Service, he should hardly be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
so great a Burden.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nay, writing to my Lord</hi> Hatton, <hi>the good Arch-bishop saith,</hi>
That my Lord <hi>Hatton</hi>'s kindness did not a little comfort him, having
received (<hi>saith he</hi>) not long since, unkinde speeches where I least
looked for them, onely for doing my duty in the most necessary Business
which I have in hand: disobedient wilful persons, (I will term them
no worse) are animated, Laws contemned, her Majesties Will and
Pleasure little regarded, and the Executors thereof in word and deed
abused: Howbeit these Overthwarts grieve me, yet I thank God, (<hi>so
the good Prelate goeth on</hi>) I am contented to sustain all these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasures,
and fully resolved not to depend upon Man, but upon God
and her Majesty.</p>
            <p>If you (<hi>saith he to my Lord</hi> Burleigh) take the part of unlearned,
young, ambitious Disturbers of Order, against the established State of
Religion, and forsake me, especially in so good a Cause; I shall think my
coming to this place to be for my punishment; and my very hard hap,
that when I think to deserve best, and in a manner to consume my self,
to satisfie that which God, her Majesty, the Church requireth of
me, I should be evil rewarded; and having risen early, and sate up late,
to give all men satisfaction, have my Labour lost, and called wilful,
Papist, Knave, and charged, that I require men to subscribe, onely to
maintain my own Book, and so sacrifice the publick to my own private
Reputation.</p>
            <p>These were the sufferings of <hi>Whitgift.</hi> Dr. <hi>Fulke</hi> for writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Brownists,</hi> professeth that he had not an hours rest for
twelve years together.</p>
            <p>And how bold <hi>Traverse</hi> was set up in the Temple against modest
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59370:12"/>
               <hi>Hooker;</hi> How the loud Lectures of the first of these were cried up,
against the solid Sermons of the other; What siding and bandying
there was in the House; What confuting in the Afternoon of what
was proved in the Morning; What Addresses to the Lords of
the Council; And how meek Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> weary of the <hi>Contrast,</hi>
was forced to retire, is obvious to all that do but dip into the
History of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time; not to mention either Dr. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe,</hi>
or Mr. <hi>Barrets</hi> Sufferings in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> with Dr. <hi>Howson</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Land</hi>'s at <hi>Oxford,</hi> for <hi>Anti-Calvimsm,</hi> which was onely another
little occasion found to quarrel with Authority, and to draw in
more persons to their Party: many learned men who favoured not
the Faction in point of <hi>Calvinistical</hi> Discipline, yet were very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
and serviceable to them in respect to their <hi>Calvinistical</hi>
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Well, during Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, the Quarrel being
confined within the Church and Schools, few acted or suffered
thereby besides Church-men and Scholars; the Laity of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Commons seldom engaging either way further than by
private tampering, encouraging, interceding, motioning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and none of them suffering any further, than that if they stood to
the great and generous Principles of Government and Religion,
they were censured as Papists, profane Enemies of the Power of
Godliness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or so.</p>
            <p>But upon the Entrance of King <hi>Iames,</hi> whom the Factious
thought a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> from his Cradle, as frighted to their way
in his Mothers belly; the Laity and Clergy began to side more
openly: Dr. <hi>Nevil,</hi> Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was not so soon with
that King, from Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and the rest of the Clergy,
as Mr. <hi>Lewis Pickering,</hi> a <hi>Northamptonshire</hi> Gentleman, waited upon
him from the <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> upon whose return, judging by the
Kings temper, that they who had most Voices and Friends were
likely to carry it, at least, for Liberty and Toleration, (a great
Multitude was thought by them a strong Argument with that
Prince) they set up the <hi>mille-manus</hi> Petition, called so, for the
thousand hands they pretended were to it: (Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> in
the mean time Caressing his Majesty with all the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
Courtships in the world, in an Epistle Dedicatory to his <hi>Latine</hi>
Commentary on <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi>) with the Importunity whereof, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Mediation of some Lords, especially the <hi>Scotch,</hi>
(for now <hi>Presbytery</hi> had got a whole Nation, I mean <hi>Scotland,</hi>
of their side) there was a Conference held at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King and the Lords of the Council, between eight Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
eight Deans, and two other Divines, on the one side;
Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sparkes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knewstubs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chadderton,</hi>
on the other: The issue whereof, notwithstanding the Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
wherewith they had prepossessed his Majesty, and the
powerful Intercession of many Grandees, was much beyond their
expectation; the King declaring, that if that be all the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi>
have to say, which they said there, they should Conform,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59370:12"/>
or he would hurry them out of the Land, or do worse: whereupon
another Petition is out of hand carried on, and Hands not so much
<hi>gathered,</hi> as <hi>scraped</hi> to it; (Mr. <hi>George Goring</hi> (afterwards Earl of
<hi>Norwich</hi>) being, in the right of his zealous Mother, one of the
Subscribers, when he was so young as to know but little, and care
less for Church-Government) and the thing not so much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to his Majesty to incline him, as to be scattered up and down
the Nation, to <hi>Enrage</hi> and Engage the People, some great ones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to it, and some potent strangers (<hi>i.e. Scots</hi>) undertaking
to conduct and manage it. Insomuch that Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift</hi>
fearing a stronger Assault of <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> against Church-Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
than his Age-feebled body should be able to withstand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
that he might not live to see the Parliament that was to be 1603/4;
and indeed he did not, for he died before it of a Cold, got by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one cold Morning to <hi>Fulham,</hi> to consult with the Bishops and
other learned men, what was best to be done for the Church in the
next Parliament.</p>
            <p>And though after his death, wise and resolute Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
the Church-government by an hundred fourty one Canons,
against all Innovations: And the <hi>Puritans</hi> were grown to such a
degree of odiousness with King <hi>Iames,</hi> and some Courtiers, that the
very <hi>Family of love</hi> made a Petition to King <hi>Iames,</hi> to be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from them, as either ashamed or afraid to be of their Number.
Yea, and though the wise King had silenced all the popular Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
with his wise Maxime, <hi>No Bishop, no King,</hi> yet Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi>
suffered so much in Libels (the Squibs and Paper-Guns that made
way for the Gunning that followed) that a Gentleman bringing him
one of them that he had taken up, was desired to lay it up in such a
place, where, he said, there were an hundred more of that nature;
and was censured for a Papist while he lived, and had the Brethrens
good word when he died, to this purpose;
<q>
                  <l>Here lies his Grace in cold Clay clad,</l>
                  <l>Who died for want of what he had.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And upon his altering of his Will:
<q>
                  <l>He who never repented of doing ill,</l>
                  <l>Repented that once he made a good Will.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>An Assembly in <hi>Aberdeen</hi> made a fearful work in <hi>Scotland.</hi> An
Insurrection was made in <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> under pretence indeed of
throwing down the Inclosures of some Fields, but indeed to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
those of the Church and State. There were three days hot
Contest, 1607. between the Bishops and Judges, before the King,
about the Limitations of the Civil and Ecclesiastical Courts, and
about Prohibitions. Then the dangerous Book called, <hi>The Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
came out: And therewith so much fear, jealousie, and suspition,
as caused the Lords and Commons, and the whole Realm, to take
anew the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; and so many strange
Motions were made in the Parliament, continued for six years
together, that the King thought fit by Proclamation to dissolve it.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59370:13"/>
The Faction that would, forsooth, redress Grievances in the Church,
to make their Party the more, take in hand all the Grievances in the
State. So that no sooner was a man discontented upon any occasion,
but he was made a <hi>Puritan</hi> streight, some of that Party taking his
Cause in hand; insomuch, that they were looked upon as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
of the Subjects Liberty, and the best Patriots and Common-wealths-men,
all others being esteemed Betrayers of their Country,
and Court-Parasites. And now they were broke in Parliament,
they trouble the Bishops and others in every Court, countenancing
Offenders, teaching them to elude the Law, vexing Ecclesiastical
Courts with Prohibitions, endeavouring to overthrow his Majesty's
Power over the Church, in the Star-Chamber, and High-Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Poor Dr. <hi>Howson</hi> is suspended at <hi>Oxford, Propter Conciones mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Orthodoxas, &amp; offensionis plenas:</hi> Onely for discovering the
danger of admitting the <hi>Geneva</hi>-Notes. Mr. <hi>Lawd</hi> censured both for
a Sermon and a Position, by the same party: Yea, and learned <hi>Selden</hi>
lets fly upon all the Parsonage-Barns, the dreadfullest storm that
they had endured a long time, in a Book called, <hi>The History of Tythes.</hi>
In the Preface to which Book, he lets fly as desperately against the
persons of the Orthodox Clergy, as he had done in the body of it,
against their Maintenance.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Mocket</hi> no sooner published his <hi>Politica Ecclesiae Anglicanae,</hi> to
satisfie the World, but his Book was burned, and his heart broken,
to satisfie a Faction; though very learned and good men were by
them set against his Book: They like the Cat, putting others upon
that hot service, whereon they would not venture their own paws.</p>
            <p>What ill Offices were done Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> and Bishop <hi>Neale,</hi> to King
<hi>Iames,</hi> by the Lord Chancellour <hi>Elsemere,</hi> upon the Instigation of
Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> How Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in the matter of his Election to the Headship of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s:
What rancounters there were between him and Bishop <hi>Williams,</hi>
whom that Party had incensed against him: The Ratling he had
from the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for but procuring poor Vicars
some ease in the point of Subsidies, the Archbishop pretending that
he meddled too much with Publick Affairs; though the Duke of
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Williams</hi> himself confessed, that it was the
best service that had been done the Church for seven years before.</p>
            <p>These, and many more the great sufferings of men well-affected
to the Government of the Church, are notorious in King <hi>Iames</hi> his
time, but not so eminent as those in King <hi>Charles</hi> his days.</p>
            <p>When the King being engaged by them in a War and other Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
(for it was at their request, that Prince <hi>Charles</hi> moved his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to declare a War against the <hi>Spaniard</hi>) they being curbed all
the Reign of King <hi>Iames,</hi> thought they had the onely opportunity
that men could wish in the world: for the King could not go to
War without Money and Men; these they had taught the People
could not be raised without their Consent in Parliament, where
among the discontented and ill-bred Gentlemen (whom the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi>
had bred up; for when you could hear little of them in
the Church, in the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59370:13"/>
throughout King <hi>Iames,</hi> they lurked as Schoolmasters and Chaplains
in Gentlemens houses.) They had a great stroke (and so great, that
the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> did a great while court
the <hi>Puritan</hi> Faction) and nothing would they gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the King, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he would let them do what was good in their own eyes.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> having the Care of three Kingdoms intrusted with
him by the Laws of God and the Land, and finding the danger they
were brought into, called upon the Parliament to assist him with
such Tribute and Contribution as might be proportionable to the
greatness of his Affairs: they considering the streight he was reduced
into, resolved that they would redress Grievances before they
would yield any Subsidies: To that purpose they make bold to
question his greatest and dearest Favourites and States-men; and
first, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> against whom they set the Earl of
<hi>Bristol;</hi> and when he could make nothing of it, the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
its self, with thirteen Articles attaqued that great Person, who
had no fault, as it seems by his Replies, but his great Place, and his
Princes Favour; that Party designing thereby to make it dangerous
for any person to give the King faithful Counsel, or to assist him
in keeping up the Government, unless in compliance with them; as
they made it more than evident, when they offered the Duke with
their Interest upon some Conditions to bring him off. <hi>Here is the first
blow at the greatest stay of Government, the Kings Majesty's Council.</hi> The
next thing they do, notwithstanding the great danger of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
is to declare, <hi>That they must clear the Liberty and Propriety of the
Subject, that</hi> (forsooth they are the <hi>Demagog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es</hi> own words) <hi>they
might know, whether they could call any thing their own, before they
should give the King any thing.</hi> And when Nature, Policy, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
taught the World, that his Majesty who had the Care of the
Kingdom, must not let it perish for the humour of some people, that
would allow nothing towards the maintena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce either of themselves,
or it; (choosing, as one <hi>Turner</hi> said openly in the House, <hi>Rather to
fall into the hands of Enemies abroad, than to submit to the Government,
as then established, at home.</hi>) And some Divines preached (what is
great reason) <hi>That his Majesty being Intrusted by God with a Power to
defend his Kingdom, must have a power too by all means to raise Men and
Money in spight of any malicious Factions, wherewith he may defend it.</hi>
For this, Dr. <hi>Mainwaring</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sibthorpe,</hi> both, as I take it, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Chaplains, are questioned, not by the Church, to whose Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
Errours in Doctrines most properly belong, but by the
Lay-Elders of the House of Commons: Yea, and if the Farmers of
the <hi>Custom-house</hi> advance any money upon the Kings ancient Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
of Tonnage and Poundage, they shall be questioned for that;
and for Levying any Imposts upon any Commodities whatsoever.
That's the second Blow at his Majesties Prerogative and Revenue:
wherein I may include the noise they made against Coat and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct-money
and Free-quarter.</p>
            <p>Having weakned the Civil Power by these Courses, they thought
it easie to overthrow the Ecclesiastical; for the Faction grown bold
and considerable by the remisness of a great Prelate, and the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59370:14"/>
of others, question all Proceedings in Ecclesiastical Courts,
open a door to several vexatious Suits against several Officers of
that Court; besides that they questioned Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> Mr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi>
and threatned Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> Bishop <hi>Neile,</hi> and others, that were
resolved to stand by the Supream Power of the King in Ecclesiastical
Affairs, against which they levelled their third Blow.</p>
            <p>And when all this would not do, they examine the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
for divers years together; the disbursment of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
the administrations of War and Peace. They rake into
Prince <hi>Henry</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> his death; and this with such a deal of
stir and tumult, that some of them lock the Parliament Doors, others
make such a noise as rings all over <hi>Westminster;</hi> others force the
Speaker, Sir <hi>Iohn Finch,</hi> and hold him, whether he would or no, in
the Chair, when he would have left the House, when it was become
rather a <hi>Billingsgate</hi> Conventicle, than an House of Parliament.</p>
            <p>When the turbulent House of Commons was dissolved, and the
Faction having got a new Maxime, <hi>That they might say and do what
they pleased within the Walls of that House, as publick persons,</hi> whereof
they were to give no account, as private men, lost the benefit of it
by that Dissolution, (the King resolving, that they should not make
the Parliament a Conspiracy) they fall to Libelling, Printing, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Insinuations, Evasions, and Elusions of the Civil and Ecclesiastical
Laws, that tended to the securing of the Government; secret and
open Oppositions to all the ways the King took to raise money,
though never so legally, (the just King always consulting his Judges
about the Legality of all Taxes, before he ordered his Officers to
gather them.) For the first Question in that Kings Reign was, <hi>Is it
just?</hi> And the next, <hi>Is it convenient?</hi> And those men that have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Millions on others since, grudged to pay then twenty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;
for it was but twenty shillings Ship-money that Mr. <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
went to Law with the King for, and my Lord <hi>Say</hi> but for four
pounds. And that five pounds was the occasion of all the stir after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
made about the Ship-money, which cost the Nation fifty seven
Millions Sterling since. The untoward Reading in the Innes of
Court upon Points most dangerous to Government, possessing the
People with strange Fears and Jealousies about Religion, <hi>German</hi>
Horse, a <hi>French</hi> and Arbitrary Government, and what not? Every
publick Action of the King or his Ministers, being mis-interpreted.
Combinations were held between the factious <hi>English,</hi> and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<hi>Scots;</hi> whose begging-time being over at Court, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
of coming to Plunder the Country. The Faction gives out,
that the King had deserted the <hi>Protestants</hi> of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> when the truth is, they had deserted him. The Bishops in
their Visitations were every where opposed, and the Troublesom
taught how to elude all Church-Obligations by Common Law.</p>
            <p>In a word, notwithstanding that the Kingdom injoyed for the first
fifteen years of the excellent King <hi>Charles</hi> I. his Reign; Trade flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,
and Gold and Silver in his time was almost as plentiful as in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons:</hi>
Learning and all Arts were improved to the heighth; and
Scholars Encouragements were as great as their Improvements; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59370:14"/>
grew up to its primitive Beauty and Purity; Law and Justice
secured all persons in their just Acquisitions: The People had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to do any thing by evil; the Rich durst not wrong the
Poor, neither need the Poor envy or fear the Rich.</p>
            <p>The Treasure of <hi>Spain</hi> was coined in our Mint, and exchanged
for our Commodities; forreign Nations either feared our Arms, or
sought our Friendship: We claimed and enjoyed the Dominion of
the Sea; Wars, Plagues and Famines were strangers to our Coasts;
and we were, even against our will, the happiest People under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
except onely for this, that we were not sensible either of our
Happiness, or of the use of it; understanding, it seems, no more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of the great blessing of Peace and good Government,
than wantonness and unthankfulness.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding fifteen years of the most blessed effects of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
Wisdom, Piety, and Peaceableness of an excellent Prince, of
whom the World was <hi>not worthy:</hi> By the practices of Cardinal <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi>
and others, who envied and feared our happiness; by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence
and Schism of the <hi>Scots;</hi> by the comprehensive Combination
in <hi>England,</hi> that had taken in with the <hi>Puritan</hi> Factions, all the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented,
ambitious, turbulent, innovating, covetous, desperate, and
most easily-deluded sort of people: by the <hi>wilde courses</hi> of such as had
offended beyond all security, save in a troublesom time; by a general
<hi>Odium</hi> cast upon all Acts of Government, and a perverse Spirit of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
fears, and jealousies, raised throughout the three Kingdoms,
and vehemently possessing all sorts of people; by the necessities of
the King, and some forreign troubles; by the treachery of some that
had the management of the Affairs of <hi>Scotland:</hi> That which was
at first but an Opinion, after that a Book-controversie, and never
durst look beyond a Motion, a Petition, a Supplication, a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
a Disputation, and some private murmurings at best, became
now a War.</p>
            <p>The cause whereof on the one side was an old Schism maintained;
mens private Interests promoted; Rebellion, that sin like Witchcraft,
the overthrow of all Laws and Government, the ruine of Learning,
Religion, and Order; the piecing up of broken Estates by Rapine
and Plunder; an ambition to attain to those Honours and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in troublesom times, that they despaired of in those more
quiet, as derived on persons of more worth and deserving: A can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
pretence for Liberty of Conscience and of the Subject, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at last nothing but Licentiousness; the Umbrage of the publick
good, when it appeared at last but the project of private persons,
who no sooner overthrew the Government, but they quarrelled one
with another; till at last, instead of one good Government, we had
so many, that we had none at all; and instead of an excellent
King, all the Bloud, Treasures, and Pretences, ended in a sordid,
base, bloudy, tyrannical, and upstart Usurper, raised out of the
meanest of the people.</p>
            <p>A Revenge of some particular and personal Wrongs, with the
ruine of the Publick; the setting up of Sects, Schisms, and Heresies,
upon the subversion of the established Doctrine and Discipline: a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59370:15"/>
perpetual disgrace and dishonour to Christianity and the <hi>English</hi>
Nation, occasioning such Burdens and Mischiefs as the Child unborn
may rue; Burdens and Mischiefs conveyed from them to late Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
the desolation of the Country, the ruine of gallant Churches,
Castles and Cities; the undoing of some thousands of Families;
the bloud of 80000 killed on both sides, and upon all occasions:
An unnatural division and animosity begun even among Relations,
that is like to last from Generation to Generation; abominable Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
taking of the Name of God in vain; hypocrisie, perjury, against
the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, the Protestation, yea, the
Covenant which they took themselves, and all the Obligations they
owed to God or Man; the mocking of God by Fasts, Prayers, and
seeking of his face to wicked and vile purposes; the making of him
the Author of the Abominations he abhors; the making of Religion
onely a Cloak to Villanies; and all the Ordinances of it, especially
Sermons and Sacraments, the Ministeries of horrid undertakings,
filling Pulpits with such Non-sence and Lyes, as all Ears that heard
tingled. Such encouragement to loose Fancies and vile Opinions,
to enlarge and increase their Party, as left not unshaken any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in the whole compass of Christian Religion; a Sacriledge
unheard-of, that was to swallow up all Bishops and Dean and
Chapters Lands, all Tithes and Ministers Maintenance, all Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
and publick Schools, all Hospitals, Colledges, and charitable
Foundations: a Rapine that carried away all the Crown-Revenue,
and sent a great Royal Family a begging; devoured the Estates of
above 12000 Noblemen, Gentlemen, and persons of eminent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and indeed left no man so much propriety as to say, <hi>This is mine,</hi>
there being no other Law or Judicature, than that Arbitrary one of
the Sword; carrying on of the publick good, till the Nation was
beggered; a crying up of the power of Parliaments, till the House
of Lords was laid by, and the House of Commons consisting of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
five hundred Gentlemen, reduced to fifty or sixty Mechanicks
and poor fellows, who are turned out by their own Army, as a pack
of Knaves and Fools; a pretence to make the King glorious, till he
was murdered; and fighting for him against evil Counsellours, till
they cut off his head, the best Counsellour he had. The rendring
of a Nation once the Envy and Terrour of the World, now its
Scorn and Contempt; and <hi>Englishmen</hi> once the Glory of <hi>Europe,</hi>
now its Shame, for doing that which <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
abhorred, crying out, <hi>You fight, and judge your King!</hi> Not
to say any thing of the general horrour and consternation that seized
all the <hi>Christian</hi> World, upon that horrid Conspiracy. The letting
loose of all the Jesuitical Principles that had troubled the World,
but were never before owned by <hi>things</hi> that would be called

Member of the House of Commons, at their first admission to sit
there, when they took the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy;

            <p>This was the Cause on the other hand; and such as the Causes
were, were the persons ingaged in them. Against the King, the Law,
and Religion, were a company of poor Tradesmen, broken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
Citizens, deluded and Priest-ridden women, discontented
Spirits, creeping, pitiful, and neglected Ministers, and Trencher-Chaplains;
Enthusiastical Factions, such as Independents, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,
Seekers, Quakers, Levellers, Fifth Monarchy-men, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
the rude Rabble that knew not wherefore they were got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
Jesuited Politicians, Taylers, Shoomakers, Linkboys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
guilty and notorious Offenders, that had endured or feared the
Law: perjured and deceitful Hypocrites and Atheists; mercenary
Souldiers, hollow-hearted and ambitious Courtiers, one or two
poor and disobliged Lords, cowardly and ignorant Neuters, here
and there a <hi>Protestant</hi> frighted out of his wits. These were the Factions
Champions; when on the Kings side, there were all the Bishops of
the Land, all the Deans, Prebends, and learned men; both the
Universities; all the Princes, Dukes, and Marquesses; all the Earls
and Lords, except two or three, that stayed at <hi>Westminster</hi> to make
faces one upon another, and wait on their Masters the Commons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they bid them go about their business, telling them they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do for them, and voting them useless: All the Knights and
Gentlemen in the three Nations, except a score of Sectaries and
Atheists, that kept with their Brethren and Sisters for the Cause:
The Judges and best Lawyers in the Land; all the States-men and
Counsellours; the Officers and great men of the Kingdoms; all the
Princes and States of <hi>Europe.</hi> Of all which gallant persons, take this

the perpetual memory of the Testimony they gave to the duty

            <p>The Faction take the same course to ruine a Kingdom, that they
said the Gods took to ruine a Man; first, to infatuate, and then
overthrow; make the first stroke at the Head and Councel of the

as a true Servant of his Interest, rather than of his Power.
So eminent was he and my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that Rebellion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired
of success, as long as the first lived; and Schism of licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as long as the second stood. Take my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> as accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and you will find his Integrity and Ability, that he managed
his whole Government either by the Law, or the Interest of his
Country. Take him as dying, and you will see his Parts and Piety;
his Resolution for himself, his Self-resignation for the Kingdoms
good; his Devotion for the Church, whose Patrimony he forbad
his Son upon his Blessing. Take him as dead, you will find him
glorious and renowned in these three Characters.</p>

bold, yet just; and he had a vigour proper for the execution of
them: Of an eloquence next that of his Masters, Masculine and
excellent. He was no less affectionate to the Church, than to the
State; and not contented while living to defend the Government
and Patrimony of it, he commended it also to his Son when he was
about to die, and charged his abhorrency of Sacriledge. His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
called the majesty of his Mind in his Lieutenancie, pride;
and the undaunted execution of his Office on the Contumacious,
the Insolency of his Fortune. He was censured for that fatal errour
of following the King to <hi>London,</hi> and to the Parliament, after the
Pacification at <hi>York;</hi> And 'twas thought, that if he had gone over
to his Charge in <hi>Ireland,</hi> he might have secured both himself, and
that Kingdom for his Majesties Service. But some attribute this
Counsel to a necessity of Fate, whose first stroke is at the Brain of
those whom it designs to ruine; and brought him to feel the effects

I mean of such as modelled, fashioned, accomplished him for State-concernments;
of a searching and penetrating Judgment, nimble
apprehension, ready and fluent in all results of Council; most
happy in the vein of Speech, which was alwayes round, perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and express, much to the advantage of his sense; and so full
stocked with Reason, that he might be rather said to demonstrate,
than to argue.</p>
               <p>As these Abilities raised him to State-Administration; so his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing,
his applying those Abilities so faithfully in promotion of
the Royal Interest, soon rendred him a Favourite of the first Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission:
So that never King had a more Intelligent, and withal, a
firmer Servant than he was to his Majesty. But these qualities which
rendred him so amiable to his Majesty, represented him formidable
to the <hi>Scots;</hi> so that some who were not well perswaded of the just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Sentence, thought he suffered not so much for what he
had done already, as for what he was like to have done, had he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
to the dis-service of that Nation: and that he was not sacrificed
so much to the <hi>Scots</hi> revenge, as to their fear. And certainly his fall
was as the first, so the most fatal Wound the Kings Interest ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
his three Kingdoms hardly affording another <hi>Strafford;</hi> that
is, one man his peer in Parts and Fidelity to his Majesty. He had a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59370:19"/>
singular passion for the Government and Patrimony of the Church;
both which he was studious to preserve safe and sound, either opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
them to be of sacred Extraction, or at least prudent constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
relating to holy performances. And had he wanted these po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Graces, yet in so great a Person it may be commendable, that
he was eminent for privative and negative Excellencies, being not
taxable with any vice; those petty pleasures being beneath the
satisfaction of a Soul so large as his. In short, saith the ingenious
Gentleman, <hi>He was a man who might have passed under a better notion,
had he lived in better times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This last Period is a Question; since this great States-man, and his
good Masters Goodness was so over-shadowed with their Greatness,
and their Vertues so lost in their Power, as the Sun (the aptest pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
of their Lustre and Beneficence) is hid in his own light<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they owe their great, but glorious Fame, to their misfortunes, and
their Renown to their ruine; that levelled their worth, otherwise
as much out of their reach, as their place, to vulgar apprehensions.
Eclipsed Lustre, like a veiled Beauty, is most looked on when most
covered: The setting Sun is more glorious than its self in its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,
because more low; and the lowest Planet seems biggest to
a common eye.</p>
               <p>So faithful he was, and the Archbishop, that in the <hi>Iuncto,</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them two and Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> they voted a Parliament,
though they knew themselves the first Sufferers by it; and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of his Integrity, that when he had Treason enough discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the late Transactions in <hi>York,</hi> (touching the <hi>Scots</hi> Conspiracy)
to charge his Enemies with, he waved the advantage; and secure
in his own Innocency, fell an Instance of that Maxim, <hi>That there is
no Danger small, but what is thought so.</hi> This was his great Principle,
<hi>Vsurped Royalty was never laid down by perswasion from Royal Clemency;</hi>
for, <hi>in armis jus omne regni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bishop <hi>Land</hi> was the man by whose advice he had his Power and
Preferment; and he was the man according to whose direction he
managed it: Being no sooner admitted Member of the House of
Peers, than friend to the Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells;</hi> and at the same
time of the Kings intimate Council, and the Bishops intimate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance:
his first Act in Council was, to advise his Majesty to
take Tonnage and Poundage, if it might be had as the Gift of the
People; if not, as one of the Duties belonging to his Prerogative;
a Prerogative without which Kingdoms are not safe; for if Kings
have not an absolute power, when there is need to impose on their
Subjects, they may not have power when there is occasion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
them: they that weaken their Soveraigns power, weaken their
own security; and when a Prince is reduced to that pass, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help and serve himself, he will quickly come to that pass, that he
shall not be able to protect his people. His next was, to advise
the King to stand by the Farmers of the Custom-house, when que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned,
<hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Wolstenholm,</hi> Mr. <hi>Daws,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Caermarthin.</hi>
Good Servants are neither to be encouraged in Wrong, nor to be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59370:19"/>
forsaken in the Right: That Prince must shew himself resolute and
stout, whose Affairs cannot be managed by cowardly Servants. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
counselled the questioning of the refractory Members in the
House of Commons, that kept the Speaker in his Chair in spight of
his teeth, locked up the Doors against all Messages from the King,
detained the Serjeant at Arms by force, declared their fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Traytors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But my Lord of <hi>Strafford</hi> was for neglecting
them: the Action, if questioned, might be made out to the people,
to be a defence of their Liberty; whereas, if sleighted, it is but a
<hi>Hubbub;</hi> and they that were at first condemned by all for their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
would be, if convented, at last pitied for their Sufferings.
The great <hi>Richlieu</hi> construed an old Maxime<note n="a" place="margin">Injuriae sprelae ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olescunt.</note> of <hi>Tacitus</hi> thus:
—<hi>Criminals never grow considerable till</hi> thought <hi>so, and so raised
from despicable Delinquents to a formidable Party.</hi> Innovation the
whole Councel suspected always, as bringing with it more Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
by the Change, than Advantage by the Reformation; and
he condemned upon this observation, <hi>That where Reformation once
drew on a Change, the desire of change an hundred times but pretended
Reformation.</hi> Although he had no minde to meddle with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Seditious in the last Parliament, yet he took special no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Doctrines of one of them, <hi>viz. Eliot,</hi> that said, <hi>He was not
bound to give an account, as a private person, before the Councel, of what
he said or did as a publick person in Parliament:</hi> As if (as the wise
man would observe with much impatience) <hi>That August Assembly
that advised about Laws to punish Disorders, should be the onely Sanctuary
for them: And a Parliament were no other than the</hi> Saturnalia <hi>of</hi> Rome,
<hi>where Slaves for some days in the</hi> year, <hi>might say (and do) what they
pleased of their</hi> Masters.</p>
               <p>It was easie for him to foresee the readiness of the Emperour to
yield to a peace, when pressed so hard by the <hi>Swede:</hi> but to come
one Morning to the Councel, when they were most busie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
about the War with <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign upon <hi>Spain,</hi> as <hi>Spain</hi> had upon them.</note> and assure them that <hi>France</hi>
would begg a <hi>Peace,</hi> as they did by the Mediation of <hi>Venice,</hi> was a
foresight none owned, but one, that, as it is said of <hi>Mazarine, Was
of all the Councels of</hi> Europe: Adding, <hi>That that was a time for</hi>
England, <hi>though low, to be Courted</hi> as it was from <hi>Spain, Venice,
Holland, Denmark,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and not to be provoked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None more diligent to finde out ways to supply the Kings occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
yet none more severe than this Lord against Books of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
such as <hi>Dudley</hi>'s, and others Books, designed rather to raise the
Jealousies of the People, than the Revenue of the King: None se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
against Libels, and others the sad Prognosticks of the sad
times approaching; yet none more against the vexing, imprisoning,
and mutilating those Offenders, than he; judging it safer to cut off,
or pardon, than distress any man; that is, to take away either his
power or will to Revenge: The vexed and distressed man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
before peoples eyes, to move or exasperate them, the dead
and pardoned are forgotten.</p>
               <p>My Lord had vast Affections for the <hi>Protestant</hi> Interest, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by his Proposals in Councel, his wishes rather than his hopes,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59370:20"/>
and what he <hi>would,</hi> rather then what he <hi>could</hi> do: yet he sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Assistants, as rather an Army of Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
than the Auxiliaries of Friends. Two things he said undid us:
<list>
                     <item>1. That our Divines had been so careless in opening the ground of
Religion; that Novelties had got such advantages over ancient Truths,
as to charge primitive Practices, for Innovations.</item>
                     <item>2. That our Lawyers were so byassed in their explications of the ground
of the Law, that old Laws, such as those of <hi>Knighthood,</hi> (whereby the
Subjects holding of the King (as all do originally) were either to be
Knighted, or fined for it) and that for <hi>Ship-money,</hi> shall be cried
down for new Exactions.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord applauded his Majesties generous Goodness in stopping
the<note n="c" place="margin">In which Tryal he was one of the Iudges.</note> Combate between the Witnesses about <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Design
to entertain all the <hi>Scots</hi> abroad, to serve him against his Prince at
home; but he feared his easiness afterwards in trusting him: He
like <hi>H.</hi> 7. being at once what few men are, most suspicious, most
knowing, and most stout; whereas, usually the suspicious man is
one that knows little, and fears much.</p>
               <p>Much did he resent the Differences between <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
and more, with Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> encouraged he the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
between the Seculars and Jesuits; as he did in Civil Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
between some <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>English;</hi> advising, that the Press
might be open to them, to discover the nakedness of their Parties;
and shut to our Disputants, the <hi>Sabbatarians</hi> and <hi>Anti-Sabbatarians,</hi>
the <hi>Arminians</hi> and <hi>Anti-Arminians,</hi> lest we betray our own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;
(it was his Maxime) <hi>For Schools positive, and practical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
onely for Presses and Pulpits.</hi> A Maxime of as great concernment
to the Church, as his Contributions for <hi>Pauls;</hi> which to say no
more, were worthy the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s friend.
From being a Member of the Councel in the <hi>South,</hi> he was advanced
Lord President of the <hi>North;</hi> and thence a while after, Lord Deputy
of <hi>Ireland.</hi> In the <hi>North</hi> begun that Animosity between him and
<hi>Vane,</hi> about <hi>Raby,</hi> that was not allayed but with his bloud: Here
he would have strengthned the Law by Prerogative, always making
good the Prerogative by Law; some there complained to him of the
Kings Government, and he told them, <hi>They complained of the Laws;</hi>
adding, <hi>That the little Finger of the Law (if not moderated by the Kings
Clemency) would be heavier than the Kings Loyns.</hi> He endeavoured
to indear his Majesties Government to his best Subjects, and render
it dreadful to the worst. Parts and Merits imployed against the
Government by mistake, he informed, and encouraged to better Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
but Parts and Merits poysoned by Pride and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he suppressed and sleighted; saying, <hi>He loved not a man of large
Parts, and a narrow and selfish Spirit.</hi> He had Worth that was sure
to raise Envy, and a Prudence to allay it, moderating the power he
had himself, and maintaining that of other Magistrates, who might be
his Skreen: Who, as he ingrossed not Business to exercise his
Power; so he intangled it not to raise a suspicion of his Cunning;
carrying things on in a plain and open, rather than a private and
close way; not that he feared the effects of Envy on himself

and Well-beloved Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> General, himself
undertaking the place of <hi>Lieutenant General,</hi> not doubting to chase
the Rebels [to use his own words] in two moneths, had not the
Lord <hi>Conway</hi> [whether out of design or weakness, not yet decided]
disheartned the Army, by the unsuccessfulness and indiscretion of
his first Encounter, and the English Lords prevented the Victory
by a Petition for Peace and a Parliament, to the King; whose ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derness
of his Subjects blood, and prudence not to sully his glory
with an unequal Combate, would not permit him to fight, when
the gains of a Victory could not ballance the hazard of attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it.</p>
               <p>His Advices against the Faction were prudent, and the Remedies
seasonable. 1. The exploding of their Doctrine, when urged by
some men, whose compliance with the factious way, was called
<hi>Moderation</hi> in their own: and the discovering of their practices in
the <hi>Examen Conjurationis Scoticae:</hi> Or, <hi>The ungirding of the Scots Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor;</hi>
the Authour his servant; and the thing his design to let the
world <hi>see,</hi> what it afterwards <hi>felt.</hi> 2. Bringing all the Scots in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to declare against the dangerous Covenant of <hi>Scotland.</hi> 3. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the loyal and ready Assistance of the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi> in
39. a president for that of <hi>England</hi> in 40. 4. And returning as sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
to lay open their pretences, and obviate their reaches in
<hi>Treaties,</hi> as he had done their Plot in Parliaments; willing enough
to hear of a present Peace, but more willing to provide a future
Security; saying, <hi>He could pardon, but not trust a Scot.</hi> He managed
his Army as Lieutenant General, as if he had been ready to fight
them: and yet he ordered his Advices, as if he were willing to
close with them. As they judged it their best way to ask with their
Sword in their hands, so thought he it the most expedient method
to answer them so. Since, though God never intrusted Subjects
with the Sword, to obtain their priviledges; yet he did Kings <hi>with
it</hi> to awe to duty. He knew what he did when he commanded the
Governors of <hi>Barwick</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> to watch the Invaders on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
at the same time that he looked to them in Councels, where
he was resolved they should not obtain that by a Pacification, that
they could not hope for by a Battel; perswading His Majesty to
examine the Conspiracy to the bottom, before he composed it, lest
the skinned Sore might rankle: To which purpose he would deal
with the Tumult not joyntly and all together, where they were
bold and reserved, but singly, and one by one; for in that capacity
Rebels are fearful and open, though it was not then possibly so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
a saying, yet it hath appeared since to be a very faithful and
useful one; that he hasting into <hi>England</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as they did
out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> should say upon the Delivery of his Sword, If e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
I return to this Honorable Sword, I shall not leave of the Scots
Faction neither Root nor Branch. As <hi>Sylla</hi> said of <hi>Caesar,</hi> there are

and rather than fail, to six. But Sir <hi>Henry</hi> not observing his Instructions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
twelve only without abatement or going lower: That the height of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

Sir <hi>Henry Vane.</hi> He confesseth, that at the Council-table, he Advised the King to an

day, in regard I have been known these many years, and I do
thank God, and your Lordship for it, that you are here; I should
be very glad to obtain so much silence, as to be heard a few words;
but, I doubt, I shall not, the noise is so great.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>My Lords,</hi> I am come hither, by the good will and pleasure of
Almighty God, to pay that last debt I owe to sin, which is death;
and by the blessing of that God, to rise again, through the merits
of Jesus Christ, to righteousness and life eternal. [<hi>Here he was a
little interrupted.</hi>]</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>My Lords,</hi> I am come hither, to submit to that judgment which
hath Passed against me; I do it with a very quiet and contented
mind. I thank God, I do freely forgive all the world, a forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that is not spoken from the teeth outwards (as they say) but
from the very heart: I speak in the presence of Almighty God,
before whom I stand, that there is not a displeasing thought arising
in me towards any man living. I thank God, I can say it, and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
too, my Conscience bearing me witness, that in all my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
since I had the honour to serve his Majesty, I never had any
thing, in the purpose of my heart, but what tended to the joynt
and individual prosperity of King and People; although it hath
been my ill fortune to be misconstrued.</p>
                              <p>I am not the first that hath suffered in this kind: It is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
portion of us all, while we are in this life, to err; we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
subject to be mis-judged one of another. There is one thing I
desire to free my self of, and I am very confident (speaking it now
with so much chearfulness) that I shall obtain your Christian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the belief of it. I was so far from being against Parliaments,
that I did always think the Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> were the most
happy Constitutions, that any Kingdom or Nation lived under, and
the best means under God to make the King and People happy.</p>
                              <p>For my Death here, I acquit all the world, and beseech the God
of heaven heartily to forgive them that contrived it; though in the
intentions and purposes of my heart, I am not guilty of what I
dye for: And my Lord Primate, it is a great comfort to me, that
his Majesty conceives me not meriting so severe and heavy a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
as is the utmost Execution of this Sentence, I do infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
rejoyce in this mercy of his, and I beseech God to return it
into his own bosome, that he may find mercy, when he stands in
most need of it.</p>
                              <p>I wish this Kingdom all the prosperity and happiness in the
world; I did it living, and now dying it is my wish: I do most
humbly recommend this to every one who hears me, and desire
they would lay their hands upon their hearts, and consider seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59370:34"/>
whether the beginning of the Happiness and Reformation
of a Kingdom, should be written in Letters of Bloud. Consider
this when you are at your houses, and let me never be so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as that the last of my bloud, should rise up in judgment against
any one of you: But, I fear, you are in a wrong way.</p>
                              <p>
                                 <hi>My Lords,</hi> I have but one word more, and with that I shall end.
I profess, that I dye, a true and obedient Son to the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> wherein I was born, and in which I was bred. Peace and
prosperity be ever to it.</p>
                              <p>It hath been objected (if it were an objection worth the answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
that I have been inclined to Popery; but, I say, truly from
my heart, that from the time I was one and twenty years of age,
to this present, going now upon forty nine, I never had in my heart
to doubt of this Religion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> nor ever
had any man the boldness to suggest any such thing to me, to the
best of my remembrance. And so being reconciled by the merits
of Jesus Christ my Saviour, into whose bosome, I hope, I shall
shortly be gathered, to those eternal happinesses which shall never
have an end: I desire heartily the forgiveness of every man, for any
rash or unadvised words, or any thing done amiss. And so my Lords
and Gentlemen, farewel, farewel all the things of this world.</p>
                              <p>I desire that you would be silent, and joyn with me in prayer,
and I trust in God, we shall all meet and live eternally in heaven,
there to receive the accomplishment of all happiness, where every
tear shall be wiped away from our eyes, and every sad thought
from our hearts. And so God bless this Kingdom, and Jesus have
mercy upon my soul.</p>

Life and Death
OF
S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. JOHN FINCH,
Baron Foreditch, sometimes Lord Keeper

            <p>THE fall of the last great Man, so terrified the other
Officers of State, that the Lord <hi>High-treasurer</hi> resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Staffe to the hands from whence he had it:
The Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> forsook the Master-ship of the
<hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Wards;</hi> and the<note n="*" place="margin">The Right Honorable, the then Earl, now the Duke of <hi>Newcastle.</hi>
               </note> Guardian of the Prince
returned him to the King. These Lords parting with
thir Offices, like those that scatter their Jewels and Treasures in
the way that they might delude the violence of their greedy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers;
a course, that if speedily embraced, had not only saved
them, but the <hi>Earl</hi>'s too, so willing was the Earl of <hi>B.</hi> to have been
Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> Master <hi>Pym</hi> Chancellour of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> Earl of

Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>W.</hi> Admiral, that the <hi>Historian</hi>

rendred them Implacable to the Earl, and Irreconcileable to
any methods of peace and composure,<note place="margin">Declaration <hi>Aug.</hi> 10.</note> and the King's Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty

are the words of the Declaration) <hi>with what importunities for
Offices and Preferments? what great Services should have been done for
him? and what other undertakings even to have saved the life of the
Earl of</hi> Strafford! [so Cheap a Rate it seems might have saved that
excellent Personage.]</p>
            <p>Others quitted their Country, finding the Faction as greedy of
bloud as of preferment, &amp; loath to trust themselves in that place,
<hi rend="margQuotes">where reason was guided by force, where Votes staid not the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening,
and season of Counsel in the order, gravity and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness,
befitting a Parliament, but were violently ripped up
by barbarous cruelty, and forcibly cut out abortive by Popular
Riot and Impatience:</hi> Esteeming it a hardness beyond true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
for a wise man to set himself against the breaking in of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59370:35"/>
Sea, and which is as dreadful, the madness of the people; which
to resist at present, threatneth imminent danger, but to withdraw,
gives it space to spread its fury, and gains a fitter time to repair the
breach. Of which honourable number, Sir <hi>Iohn Finch</hi> was one.</p>
            <p>A Person born for Law and Courtship, being a Branch of that
Family, which the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadour, in a discourse with King
<hi>Iames,</hi> stiled the <hi>Gentile and Obliging House;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their Ancient Sirname is <hi>Herbert.</hi>
               </note> a Family that was
inrolled Gentile, by the Commissioners appointed to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th. and which my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> called the
<hi>Lawer</hi>'s <hi>Race.</hi> At the same time, Sir <hi>Heneage Finch</hi> Recorder of
<hi>London,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Finch</hi> Sergeant at Law to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and his Son
Sir <hi>Iohn Finch</hi> Atturney General to Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Speaker to
that curious, knowing, and rich Parliament; wherein some have
observed, though wide I suppose, that the House of Commons
modestly estimated [consisting of about 500.] could buy the
House of Peers consisting of 118.) thrice over. <hi>Noremberge</hi> in
<hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> would not admit any Learned Men
into their Counsels; <hi>Because Learned Men</hi> (saith the Historian of
those places) <hi>are perplexed to resolve upon Affaires, making many
doubts full of respects and imaginations.</hi> Semblably, this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was too rich and curious to do any good.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Finch</hi> was born <hi>September</hi> 6. 1582. about one a clock the
same night <hi>Plowden</hi> died [the setting of great Lights in one place, is
their rising in another] an observation as carefully Registred by
his Father, as that is superstitiously kept by the Catholicks. That
the same day Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> died, <hi>Thomas Stapleton</hi> was born:
<hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> (presaging his two eminent Accomplishments,
a brave presence and happy eloquence, that Indeared and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
him) being Ascendants in his Horoscope.</p>
            <p>It is considerable in Sir <hi>Iohn Fineaux,</hi> his Country-man, that
he was 28. years, before he Studied the Law, that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
that profession 28. years, before he was made a Judge;
and continued a Judge 28. years before he died. And it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
in Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he was 12. years before [the sprightli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his temper, and the greatness of his spirit, stooping, with
much ado, to the Pedantry of Learning] he would learn to Read,
12. years before he Studied, 12. years more before he either Mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Law or Practiced it, his Genius leading him to Converse,
rather than Study; to Read Men rather than Books, more apt for
Business than Arguments; so much the less sollicitous for the
learning of the Law, as he was more able to supply the defect of
the Pedantick part of it; with his skill in the grounds and design
of it, and to set off that skill with a very plausible faculty of
<hi>Address</hi> and <hi>Discourse.</hi> Those two Endowments, that oblige and
command the World, and have had a great stroke, in the erecting
and managing all of the Governments in it.</p>
            <p>In the 11th year of his age [for men are curious to know even
the most minute passages of great and virtuous persons] his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
observing his <hi>make,</hi> fitted rather for a Court than a Colledge,
brought him, in a Progress the last Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> made that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59370:36"/>
way, to Kiss her Majesties Hand; with some thoughts of Inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him among the Younger Attendants of her Majesty. The
Address and Complement he managed so gracefully above his
years, and beyond expectation, that the Gracious Queen (asking
him, whether he was willing to wait upon Her, in the capacity
those Young Men he saw playing round about him, did? and he
replying, that he would never wait on any person, but a Queen;
nor, on a Queen onely, to Play about her, but to serve her, that
is, (as the Civil Audience, that have always ready a charitable
construction for youthful expression, interpreted and <hi>raised</hi> his
words) he would be an Instrument of State for her <hi>Affaires,</hi> not
only one of the number to fill <hi>her Retinue</hi>) commuted his admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to a present Service, for his Education to <hi>future</hi> Employment,
in words to this effect. I have seen my Gardeners Setting, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Cherishing Young Plants, which possibly may yield fruit
and pleasure in the next Age: And I love to cherish young inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
whose proficiency I shall not live to see, but my Successors
shall make use of: Go, go be a man.</p>
            <p>With this incouragement, and finding that it was behaviour
and discourse that set off all the men in the world, when <hi>others</hi>
conned their Parts, Lessons and Lectures, he <hi>acted</hi> them, weighing
little of any Author, but his Elegancies, and most flouried Periods,
and studying not only to observe and know those Elegancies, but
to manage them, being much affected with that Orator that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
(upon a young Students request to know what rendred
Men Eloquent) <hi>Pronunciatio, Pronunciatio, Pronunciatio, Actio, Actio,
Actio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two Studies took up most of his time: History, for the best Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of Actions; Speeches, for the best Patterns of Discourse.
To propose to our selves [saith <hi>Cicero</hi>] the most excellent example
in our discourse and life, is a good way to improvement, seeing
that if we imitate the best, we shall not be the meanest. Sir <hi>Henry
Martin</hi>
had, besides his own Collection weekly, transmitted to
<hi rend="margQuotes">him from some Proctors at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> the brief heads of the most
important Causes which were Tried in the High-Commission;
which, with some familiar friends in that Faculty, he privately
Pleaded, Acting in his Chamber, what was done in the Court, he
making it his work, and exceeding the rest in Amplifying and
Aggravating any Fault, to move anger and indignation against
the Guilt thereof; or else, in extenuating or excusing it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
pity, obtain pardon, or prevail at least for a lesser punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Whence no Cause came amiss to him in the High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission;
for (saith my Author) he was not to make now Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
but to put it on and buckle it; not to invent, but to apply
Arguments to his Clients.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Finch,</hi> besides his own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations,
had most of the eminent Speeches, Discourses, and
Pleadings of the time, which he would perform with friends in
his own person; so that, upon all the great occasions he had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to speak, his business was not so much to Compose, as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect,
accommodating, rather than new-making his Harangues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:59370:36"/>Thus accomplished for publick Affairs, with a Generous Spirit,
an Active Head, a Charming Tongue, a Grave and Awing Aspect,
an Obliging Converse, a Serious Temper, a Competent Skill in
such soft and severe Arts, as either Furnish and Adorn the Gentry;
a Happy Conduct, publick thoughts with the Politure of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
and the Inns of Court. He was after some years pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
and converse, so much in Vogue in the Inns of Court, for his
happy way of Managing Business, that he was with the King's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Choice preferred the Queens Atturney; and so much in
Repute in the Country, that he was chosen Parliament-man in that
great Parliament. 1625, 1226, 1627. called, <hi>The Parliaments of Kings:</hi>
And so much in esteem in that Parliament 1627. as by the Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Vote of it to be chosen Speaker, as his Cozen Sir <hi>Heneage
Finch</hi> the Recorder was 1621. And when Speaker, his Integrity
and Ability so Approved, in that he was pitched upon as the great
Mediator in most Cases, between the King and his People, ever
careful in his Messages of that which King <hi>Iames</hi> bid Doctor <hi>Donne</hi>
be careful of in his Sermons, never to Exasperate the King against
his People, by too Rigid a Representation of their Carriage; nor
stirr up the People against the King, by too captious an Account
of his Commands: Having what King <hi>Iames</hi> commended in my
Lord <hi>Bacon, A peculiar way of handling Matters after a mild and
gentle manner.</hi> Until the Faction grew so Impudent, as being Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to question Divines, and state questions in Divinity, without
either the assistance or assent of Convocation, as in Doctor <hi>Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi>'s
Case and Doctor <hi>Manwaring</hi>'s. 2. To Limit his Majesty in his
Ancient Right to Tonnage and Pondage, so far as to deny it him,
unless he would accept of it as their good will, and only as Tenant
at Will from Year to Year, by an Annual grant from them. 3. To
draw up Seditious Remonstrances of grievances, that they only
published to <hi>exasperate</hi> the People, never intending by redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of them, to <hi>ease</hi> them; when according to their Promise to
Assist him in the War they Engaged the King in, they should have
presented him with their Subsidies and Supplies. 4. To offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to their own Body, forcing the <hi>Sollicitor</hi> to keep the Chair
one time, the <hi>Speaker</hi> another. 5. To create and spread fears and
jealousies by feigned Letters, and Discoveries. 6. To<note n="a" place="margin">As one Dr. <hi>Tunter,</hi> and one <hi>Clement Cook</hi> did.</note> speak
Treason in the very Houses of Parliament. 7. To examine the
Secretary of States Letter and the King's, to search the Signet Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> 8. To threaten his Friends, and ruin his Favourites.
9. To Debate whether they should trust the King on his Word, and
upon Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi>'s Motion, to carry it in the Negative. 10. To
Condition with the King about Supplies, being resolved not to
Relieve his Necessities, unless he gratified their Humor. 11. To
question the Farmers of the King's Custome-house, and most of
the Officers of the Revenue: This Party having designed that the
King should neither Injoy his own Revenue, nor have any Relief
from them. 12. To offer such Remonstrances in the House, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Speaker nor Clerks would Read.</p>
            <p>I say, until the Conspiracy grew so bold, as to offer such affronts
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59370:37"/>
to Majesty and Government, as not only diminished, but endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
them; for then indeed he discoursed roundly, That not to
Supply the King now Involved in a Forraign War, was the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Grievance:</hi> A poor King, as Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> used to say, being
the most dangerous thing in the world; <hi>This</hi> importing a Ruin,
Denial of Subsidies is increasing of Necessities, other Miscarriages
only an Inconvenience. That to raise Jealousies and Fears about
Religion and Government, answered not the end of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.
which were called to Consult with the King about the
great Affairs of the Kingdom, and not to remonstrate Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances,
instead of <hi>remedying</hi> Grievances, do but aggravate them,
distracting the People whom they pretend to relieve, being Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives
against Government, rather than any Reformation of it.
That Mutual Confidence was the happiest, because the most natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
[for trust first made Kings] accommodation between Prince
and People.</p>
            <p>That it was inhumane to grant a Gracious King Subsidies, at
no lower Rate, than the Price of his best Servants bloud.</p>
            <p>That the modesty of the Subject should comply with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the King, striving to oblige, as the surest way to be obliged.</p>
            <p>And when Speeches would not do, this Excellent Person finding
the times (as his Gracious Master intimated in the first words of his
<hi>Speech,</hi> at the opening of this <hi>Parliament</hi>) for <hi>actions,</hi> and not for
<hi>words;</hi> and the Seditious made all the civilities, and kindnesses
shewed them, to draw them off their old dangerous Practises, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Incouragements to attempt new ones. When they
inveighed against my Lord Treasurer <hi>Weston,</hi> as they had done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
against the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> (<hi rend="margQuotes">It appearing evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that not the persons of men, but the King's Trust of them,
was the object of their envy; and his Favour, though never so
virtuous, marked them out for ruin.</hi>) And the Invective raised
them to such a degree of heat, that fearing they should be Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
ere they had time to Vent their Passions, they began a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
upon their own Body [an Example that lasted longer than
the Cause, and at last produced the overthrow of all their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges]
they Locked the Door of the House, kept the Key thereof
in one of their own Pockets, held him then Speaker by strong
hands in the Chair, till they had thundred out their Votes, like
dreadful <hi>Anathemaes,</hi> against those that should Levy, and (what
was an higher Rant) those that should willingly submit to pay it.
When they check him for admitting the King's Message, and move
him to put it to the Vote, whether their undutiful and ill-natured
Declaration about Tunnage and Poundage, and what they called
Invasion, should be carried to the King, or no: He craved their
Pardon, being Ordered expressely by his Majesty to leave the
House, when it was rather a Hubbub than a Parliament, and by
the<note n="a" place="margin">Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> rung.</note> noise they made at the close of each Factious Resolve, you

                  </gap>elds</hi> Tumult at a Wrestling, rather than
a Sober Counsel at a Debate; when they kept in the Sergeant of
the Mace, locked the Door, shut out the King's Messenger, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59370:37"/>
made a general Out-cry against the Speaker, who, when the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was Dissolved, drew up such a Declaration, as satisfied the
People, that the ground of this Disturbance, was not in this, or
that States-man that they complained, but in their own Burgesses,
who upon removal of those States-men, as Duke of <hi>B.</hi> &amp;c. rather
increased than abated their Disorders; and such an account of the
Seditious Party as vindicated the Honour of the King: The Ring-leaders
of the Sedition, <hi>Protesting that they came into the House with
as much zeal as any others to serve his Majesty; yet finding his Majesty
offended, humbly desired, to be the subjects rather of his Majesties mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
than of his power.</hi> And the wiser sort of their own side cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
them, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> doth <hi>Thraseas Paetus,</hi> as having used a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and therefore a foolish Liberty of their Tongues, to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:

            </p>
            <p>When he had done so much to assist the Government in Publick
Counsels, he was not wanting to it in his Private Affairs; so obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
he was to the Countrey by an extraordinary Hospitality; so
serviceable to King and Countrey, by his quick and expedite way
in all the Commissions of the Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he was intrusted with:
So happy and faithful in the management of the Queens Revenue;
so zealous for the promoting of any Design, that advanced either
the King's Honour or Service, that with the unanimous Choice of
King and Kingdom (then agreeing in few things else) he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
Lord Chief Justice of the Common-Pleas, in <hi>place,</hi> beneath,
in <hi>profit,</hi> above the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, by the
same token, that some out of design have quitted <hi>that,</hi> to accept
of <hi>this:</hi> amongst whom, was Sir <hi>Edward Mountague,</hi> in the Reign
of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. who being demanded of his Friends the reason of
his self-degradation? <hi>I am now</hi> (saith he) <hi>an old man, and love the
Kitchin above the Hall, the warmest place best suiting my age:</hi> His
Writ [so much the King confided in him] running not, <hi>Durante
bene placito,</hi> but, <hi>Quam diu se bene gesserit;</hi> and his Preferment
owed to his Merit, not his Purse, being <hi>the Iudge</hi> [to use King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s speech of Judge <hi>Nichols] that would give no money, because
[they onely buy justice, that intend to sell it]</hi> he would take none.</p>
            <p>In that Place he had two seemingly inconsistent qualities; a
great deal of Patience to attend the opening of a Cause [he would
say, He had the most wakening Evidence from the most dreaming
speakers] and a quick dispatch of it, when opened: Insomuch
that some thought to see in his time in the Common-Pleas, and
other Courts where he sate, what was seen in Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi>'s
in the High-Court of Chancery, That the Courts should rise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there were no more Causes to be tried in them. He was very
careful to declare the true grounds of the Law to the King, and to
dispense the exact Justice of it to the People: He observed, that
those who made Laws, not onely desperate, but even opposite in
terms to Maxims of Government, were true friends neither to
the Law nor Government, Rules of State and Law in a well-order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Common-wealth mutually supporting each other.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Palevizine,</hi> and Italian Gentleman, and Kinsman to <hi>Scaliger,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:59370:38"/>
had in one night all his hair changed from black to gray: This
Honourable Person immediately upon his Publick Imployment,
put on a publick Aspect, such, as he who saw him but once, might
think him to be <hi>all pride,</hi> whilst they that saw him often, knew him
to have none.</p>
            <p>So great a place must needs raise Envie; but withal, so great a
spirit must needs overcome it: Envie and Fame [neither his friend,
neither his fear] being compared by him to Scolds, which are si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced
onely with silence, being out of breath by telling their
own tales.</p>
            <p>Seriously and studiously to <hi>confute</hi> Rumors, is to <hi>confirm</hi> them,
and <hi>breed</hi> that suspition we would <hi>avoid,</hi> intimating that <hi>reality</hi> in
the story we would deny.</p>
            <p>His supposed Crimes when <hi>Chief Iustice,</hi> as <hi>now,</hi> and upon my
Lord <hi>Coventry</hi>'s death, when <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> hear how satisfactorily
he answereth in a Speech he made, after leave had to speak in the
House of Commons in his own defence, where indeed there is the
account of his whole Life.</p>

                        <p>I Give you thanks,<note place="margin">The Lord <hi>Finche;</hi> Speech in his own defence.</note> for granting me admittance to your presence;
I come not to preserve my self and fortunes, but your good
Opinion of me: For I profess, I had rather beg my bread from
door to door with [<hi>Date obolum Ballisario</hi>] your Favour, than be
never so high and honourable with your displeasure.</p>
                        <p>I came not hither to justifie my Words, Actions or Opinions,
but to open my self freely, and then to leave my self to the House.</p>
                        <p>What disadvantage it is for a man to speak in his own Cause,
you well know; I had rather another should do it; but since this
House is not taken with words, but with truth, which I am best
able to deliver, I presume to do it my self.</p>
                        <p>I come not with a set Speech, but with my heart, to open my
self freely, and then to leave it to the House; but do desire, if any
word fall from me, that shall be misconstrued; I may have leave to
explain my self.</p>
                        <p>For my Religion, I hope no man doubts it, I being religiously
Educated under <hi>Chadderton</hi> in <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge thirteen years; I
have been in <hi>Grayes-Inn</hi> thirteen years a Bencher, and a diligent
Hearer of Doctor <hi>Sibbs,</hi> who, if he were Living, would Testifie
that I had my chiefest incouragements from him; and though I
met with many oppositions from many in that house, ill-affected
in Religion, yet I was always supported by him.</p>
                        <p>Five years I have been of the King's Counsel, but no Actor, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visor,
or Inventor of any Project: Two places I have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
unto, Chief Justice, and Lord Keeper; not by any Suit or
Merit of my own, but by his Majesties free gift: In the discharge
of those places my hands have never touched, my eyes have never
been blinded with any Reward.</p>
                        <p>I never byassed for friendship, nor diverted for hatred; for all
that know me, know I was not of a vindicative nature.</p>

                           <pb n="59" facs="tcp:59370:38"/>I do not know for what particulars, or by what means you are
drawn into an ill opinion of me, since I had the honour to sit in
that place you sit in, Master Speaker; in which I served you with
all fidelity and candor: Many witnesses there are of the good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
I did you, and resumed expressions of Thankfulness from this
House for it; for the last day I had share in it, no man expressed
more symbols of sorrow than I did.</p>
                        <p>After three days Adjournment, the King desired me, it might
be Adjourned for a few days more; whether was it then in his
Majesty, much less in me, to Dissolve the House? But the King sent
for me to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and gave me a Message to the House, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me, when I had delivered the Message, forthwith to come
to him, and if a question was offered to be put, he charged me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my Allegiance, I should put none; I do not speak this as a thing
I do now merit by, but it is known to divers men, and to some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of this House. All that I say, is but to beseech you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what you would have done in this strait, betwixt the King
my Master, and this Honourable House.</p>
                        <p>The Shipping business lieth heavy upon me; I am far from ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
that my opinion; if it be contrary to the Judgment of this
House, I submit; I never knew of it at the first, or ever advised
any other.</p>
                        <p>I was made Chief Justice four days before the Writ went out
for the Port, I was sworn sixteen days after, and the Writs Issued
forth without my privity.</p>
                        <p>The King Commanded the then Chief Justice, the now Chief
Baron, and my self to look on the Presidents, and to certifie him
our Opinions, what we thought of it, <hi>That if the whole Kingdom
were in danger, it was reasonable and fit to lay the Charge for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of it, upon the whole Kingdom, and not upon the Port only.</hi> And
Commanded the then Chief Justice, my self, and the now Chief
Baron, to return him our Opinions. Our Opinions were, and we
thought it agreeable to Law and Reason, <hi>That if the whole were in
danger, the whole should contribute:</hi> This was about <hi>Iune.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In <hi>Michaelmas</hi> following, the <hi>King</hi> [but by no Advice of mine]
Commanded me to go to all the Judges, for their Opinions upon
the Case, and to Charge them upon their Allegiance to deliver
their Opinions; but this, not as a binding opinion to themselves,
but that upon better consideration or reason they might alter, but
only for his Majesties satisfaction, and that he must keep it to his
own private use [as I conceive the Judges are bound by their
Oaths to do] I protest, I never used any promise or threats to any,
but did only leave it to the Law, and so did his Majesty desire, <hi>That
no speech that way, might move us to deliver any thing contrary to our
Consciences.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There was no Judge that Subscribed, needed sollicitations to it,
there were that Refused <hi>Hutton</hi> and <hi>Crook; Crook</hi> made no doubt of
this thing, but of the introduction, <hi>I am of opinion, that when the
whole Kingdom is in danger, whereof the King is Iudge, the danger is to
born by the whole Kingdom.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="60" facs="tcp:59370:39"/>When the King would have sent to <hi>Hutton</hi> for his Opinion, the
then Lord Keeper desired to let him alone, and to leave him to
himself: That was all the ill office he did in that business.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>February</hi> 26. upon command from his Majesty by the then Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of State, the Judges did assemble in <hi>Sergeants-Inn,</hi> where then
that opinion was delivered, and afterwards was inrolled in the
<hi>Star-chamber</hi> and other Courts, at which time I used the best argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as I could; where at that time <hi>Crook</hi> and <hi>Hutton</hi> differed
in Opinion, not of the thing, but whether the King was sole
Judge.</p>
                        <p>Fifteen months from the first they all Subscribed, and it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred
in the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> and other Courts. The reason why
<hi>Crook</hi> and <hi>Hutton</hi> Subscribed was, because they were over-ruled by
the greater number. This was all I did, till I came to my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> where I argued the Case; I need not tell
you what my Arguments were, they are publick about the Town.</p>
                        <p>I delivered my self then as free as any, that the King ought to
Govern by the positive Laws of the kingdom, and not alter, but
by consent of the Parliament, and that if he made use of it, as a
Revenue or otherwise, that this judgement could not hold him; but
never declared that money should be raised.</p>
                        <p>I heard you had some hard opinion of me about this secret busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;

King and Commonwealth good service, which I did with extream
danger to my self and fortunes, left it a thing as advantageous to
the Commonwealth, as any thing else.</p>
                        <p>I never went about to overthrow the <hi>Charter</hi> of the <hi>Forrest,</hi> but
held it a sacred thing, and ought to be maintained both for the
King and People. Two Judges then were, that held the King by
the Common-law might make a <hi>Forrest</hi> where he would; when I
came to be Judge, I declared my Opinion to the contrary, that the
King was restrained, and had no power to make a Forrest, but in
his own Demesn lands.</p>
                        <p>I know that there is something laid upon me, touching the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
that came out the last Parliament, it is the King's affair,
and I am bound, without his Licence, not to disclose it; but I hope
I shall obtain leave of his Majesty, and then I shall make it appear,
that in this thing I have not deserved your disfavours, and will
give good satisfaction in any thing.</p>
                        <p>I know that you are wise, and that you will not strain things to
the uttermost sence to hurt me. God did not call <hi>David</hi> a man
after his own heart, because he had no failings, but because his

would have the whole kingdom into a Wilderness.
5. And the Declaration he drew about the evil Complexion of the
last Parliament, made good with advantage by the unheard of and
horrid outrages of <hi>this.</hi> In a word, he lived to see the Seditious
act far worse things against the King and kingdom, than his very
fear and foresight suspected of them, though he gave shreud hints
and guesses. And to see God do more for the King and kingdom,
than his hope could expect; for he saw the horrid Murder of
<hi>Charles</hi> I. and the happy Restauration of <hi>Charles</hi> II. enduring eight
years Banishment, several months Confinement and Compositions,
amounting to 7000l.</p>

            <p>WHEN neither sincerity in Religion, which he
observed severely in private, and practised ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily
in publick, nor good affections to
the Liberties of the Subject; in whose behalf
he would ever and anon take occasion to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
himself to his Majesty to this purpose.
<hi>Your poor Subjects in all humbleness assure your
Majesty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In his Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches 4. <hi>Car.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>that their greatest confidence is, and
ever must be in your grace and goodness, without which they well know,
nothing that they can frame or desire will be of safety or value to them:
Therefore are all humble Suiters to your Majesty, that your Royal heart
will graciously accept and believe the truth of theirs, which they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
pretend as full of truth, and confidence in your Royal Word and
Promise, as ever People reposed in any of their best Kings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Far from their intentions it is any way to incroach upon your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
or Prerogative; nor have they the least thought of stretching or
enlarging the former Laws in any sort, by any new interpretations or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions;
The bounds of their desires extend no further than to some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
explanation of that, which is truly comprehended within the just
sence and meaning of those Laws, with some moderate provision for
execution and performance, as in times past upon like occasion hath been
used.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They humbly assure Your Majesty they will neither loose time, nor seek
any thing of your Majesty, but that they hope may be fit for dutyful and
Loyal Subjects to ask, and for a Gracious and Iust King to grant.</hi>

charitable and munificent a Person as Sir <hi>Iohn Finch,</hi> Baron
<hi>Finch</hi> of <hi>Foreditch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Its no wonder Sir <hi>Francis Windebank</hi> was loath to hazzard his
life in a scuffle with an undisciplined Rabble, which he freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to be examined by any free and impartial Courts of Justice,
where the multitude should <hi>receive</hi> Laws, and not <hi>give</hi> them, and
<hi>reason</hi> should set bounds to passion, truth to pretences, Lawes duly
executed to disorders, and charity to fears and jealousies, when
the sacredness of some great Personages, and the honour of others,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59370:40"/>
when the best Protestants, and the best Subjects were equally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to the undistinguished Tumults, which cried out against
Popery and Ill-counsel, but struck at all men in power and favour.
Sir <hi>Francis</hi> rather ashamed than afraid, to see the lives and honours
of the most eminent persons in the Nation exposed to those rude
Assemblies, where not reason was used as to men, to perswade;
but force and terror, as to beasts to drive and compel, to whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
tumultuary Patrons shall project, left the kingdom as un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>safe,
where Factions were more powerful than Laws, and persons
chose rather to hear than to see the miseries and reproaches of
their <hi>Country,</hi> waiting for an Ebbe to follow that dreadful and
swelling Tide upon this Maxime, <hi>That the first indignation of a
mutinous multitude is most fierce, and a small delay breaks their
consent, and innocence would have a more candid censure, if at all,
at distance.</hi> Leave he did his place and preferment, like those that
scatter their Treasure and Jewels in the way, that they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
the violence of their greedy pursuers, troubled for nothing
more than that the King was the while left naked of the faithful
ministry of his dearest Servants, and exposed to the infusions and
informations of those, who were either complices or mercenaries
to the Faction, to whom they discovered his most Private Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</p>
            <p>Those aspersions laid upon him, by those that spoke rather
what they wished, than what they believed or knew he would say,
should like clouds vanish, while his reputation, like the Sun a little
muffled at present, recovered by degrees its former and usual lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
<hi>Time</hi> [his common saying] <hi>sets all well again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And time at last did make it evident to the world, that though
he and others might be subject to some miscarriages, yet such as
were far more repairable by second and better thoughts, than those
enorminous extravagancies, wherewith some men have now even
wildred, and almost quite lost both Church and State.</p>
            <p>The event of things at last demonstrating, that had the King
followed the worst counsels that could have been offered him,
Church and State could not have been brought into that condition
they were presently, in upon the pretended Reformation.</p>
            <p>Among the many ill consequences, whereof this was not the
least remarkable, <hi>viz.</hi> that those very slanderers reputation and
credit [I mean, that little they had] with the people, were quite
blasted by the breath of that same furnace of popular obloquy
and detraction, which they have studied to heat and inflame to the
highest degree of infamy, and wherein they thought to cast and
consume other mens names and honour.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, his paticence better served him to bear, and
charity to forgive, than his leasure to answer the many false asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
cast upon him, and give the malice of some men the pleasure
to see him take notice of, or remember what they so rudely said,
or barbarously objected against him.</p>
            <p>Being conscious of his own good affections and inclinations for
the publick, he could not suspect the affections of the publick to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

under the imputation of the miscarriages of the worst part of it]

of the civility of <hi>all,</hi> whereof many might be misled by others
that were inclined of themselves: His <hi>pity</hi> towards the <hi>errors</hi> of

of the Principal Secretaries of State, by his procurement of these
<hi>heinous</hi> words, being then Printed in capital letters, <hi>Iune 15. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
Francis Windebank <hi>my old friend, was sworn Secretary of State,
which place I obtained of my Gracious Master King</hi> Charles <hi>for him.</hi>
And it would have been Plea enough against that Charge, to have
taken the reasons of this favour (a great piece of equity) as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
out of the Bishops own mouth.</p>
            <p>1. His Integrity and Faithfulness so singular, that he would lay
aside all obligations to please any one, to satisfie the great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that was upon him of doing <hi>Iustice.</hi> He himself having left
behind him this Instance of his Impartiallity. <hi>In this business</hi> [mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the business between the new and old Corporation of Sope-boilers,<note place="margin">☞</note>
Debated at the Council-board at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> July 12. 1635.]
<hi>and some other of great concernment, during the Commission for the
Treasury, my old friend Sir</hi> F. W. <hi>forsook me, and joyned with the Lord</hi>
Cottington, <hi>which put me to the exercise of a great deal of patience.</hi>
The <hi>Spaniard</hi> (while all other Nations are Mercenary, and for
money will serve on any side) will never fight against his own
King; nor would this Gentleman for any interest, engage against his
two great Soveraigns, as he called them, Conscience and Honesty.</p>
            <p>2. His Lenity and Moderation, which was a hapyy mixture of
discretion and good nature, like the Silken-string, running
through the Pearl-chain of all his transactions, <hi>Si virtutum finis ille
sit maximus, qui plurimorum spectat profectum, moderatio omnium
pulcherrima est,</hi> Ambrosius <hi>de Paenitent. contra Novat. l.</hi> 1. c. 1. It
was the honour of the <hi>Romane</hi> State, as yet being <hi>Pagan: In hoc
gloriari licet, nulli gentium mitiores placuisse paenas.</hi> Having this
peculiar commendation, <hi>That he punished not only offenders that
were discovered, but those that made it their business to lay snares to
discover them.</hi> It being as dangerous (as he observed) to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of all faults, as of none at all, <hi>that</hi> involving the State in end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
troubles and jealousies, while this only made it obnoxious to
some bold attempts, which all know it could punish, though some
presume, because it doth connive.</p>
            <p>Binding some of his own Pursevants (<hi>Grey</hi> and <hi>Harwood</hi> by name)
to their Good Behaviour, as well as their Prisoners, being not able
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59370:41"/>
to endure those Hell-hounds, Horse-leaches that only sucked the
corrupted bloud of the Law. He was very much pleased in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>French</hi> Story to this purpose; Of one so much delighted in
troubling men, that when <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King offered to ease
him of a number of Suits, he earnestly besought his Highness to
leave him some 20, or 30 behind, whereby he might merrily pass
away the time.</p>
            <p>3. His Publick Spirit, his friend the Arch-bishop being not
readier to propose publick designs to him, than he to close with
them; by the same Token, that a<note n="*" place="margin">D. H.</note> Great Man, upon the Rumor
spread of his being a Papist [for all sober men in their Wits were
then Branded with the Nick-names of Papists, by those Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
who King <hi>Iames</hi> said were frighed out of their wits] repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>That he knew nothing he had of a Papist, but a very great Charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. His Plain Dealing, a great Jewel in the Court of Princes,
[<hi>Quid omnia possidentibus deest?</hi> [they are the words of the great
Courtier <hi>Seneca</hi>] <hi>Ille qui verum dicat.</hi>] And a resolution rather to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please,
than betray his Soveraign. Offering free, but humble Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
gilding and sweetning his whosesome Pills.</p>
            <p>5. His Reservedness not so close, but that he imparted as much
as might invite others to open themselves, though so wary, as not
to discover so much as might give others a hank over him: his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
faculty was a vast gift of discerning others, himself all the
while unseen, walking as in <hi>Gyges</hi> his Ring.</p>
            <p>But his great Charge urged against him in the House, <hi>November</hi>
12. 1640. and <hi>December</hi> 1. was seventy four Letters of Grace to
Recusants in four years, sixty four Priests discharged by his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
and twenty nine by his Verbal Order, and twenty three by
his Authority, under Master <hi>Reads</hi> hands. Father <hi>Ioseph</hi> the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine</hi>

which, though he dyrst not himself, yet ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ers durst for him, offer
these satisfactory Answers.</p>
            <p>1. That what he did, he did by his Majesties direction, the Kings
Majesty declaring, that the favours vouchsafed the Roman Catholicks,
had been performed by special Command and Order given to him in
that behalf, without any advice or original motion of him, who hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moved herein, as he hath been from time to time Commanded. [<hi>They
are the King's own words.</hi>]</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That that favour which he shewed Catholicks here, was to procure
the Protestants favour abroad.</hi> Allegations so reasonable, that he
desired but the favour to have his Charge set down in Writing,
and liberty to answer thereunto, in a Letter sent from <hi>Callis,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember
6. 1640.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Although yet all his Letters carried that respect to his Majesty,
that he declared,</hi> He would not alleadge his Majesties authority any
further than his Majesty would be pleased to give him leave, being will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rather to perish [<hi>they are his own words</hi>] than discover any thing
to the prejudice of his Majesties affairs.</p>
            <p>And besides, none were by him discharged without Bonds &amp; Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for their behaving themselves according to Law. And this whole
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59370:42"/>
affair was no new thing, but the practise of the wise and religious
King <hi>Iames,</hi> who understood the interest of the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as well as any Prince in the world, and promoted the concerns
of it, more ways than any man in <hi>England,</hi> in whose Reign <hi>Anno</hi>

            <p>It was pity he was forced to live and dye among strangers, more

so, by the unkindness of some Protestants, who dressed him and
others with Nick-names of Popery, as the Heathens did the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
in Beasts Skins, that they might first expose, and afterwards
beat them. Only he was happy in this, that the Faction did not
persecute him so rigidly, as all the Court loved him intirely, those
very Lords that favoured the Conspiracy, being very careful of
him, who lived to see them repent more of their Compliance, than
he had occasion to do of his Loyalty, though his little state [the

            <p>IT is true, this Excellent Person died just when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
began to offer violence to others, yet dying
then, he could not escape from the violence of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
<hi>Peter Martyrs</hi> wife, <hi>P. Fagius,</hi> and <hi>Martin Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rs</hi>
are reckoned a sort of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Martyrs (though
they dyed before) because their bodies were then digged from
their Graves, and buried in a Dunghill. And this great man
claimes justly a place in the Catalogue of Loyal Martyrs, because
though dying <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. yet was afterwards fetched out of the
Bed of Honour, in which the Church had laid him, and his Grave
made among Hereticks and Pestilent Fellows.</p>
            <p>It was one Branch of Arch-bishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Charge, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
this Professed <hi>Arminian</hi> to be President of a Colledge in
the University,<note place="margin">C. C. Oxon. Peterburgh.</note> Dean of a Cathedral in the Church. And he
could not have escaped that accepted these preferments. He was
reckoned a good man of old, that new hated. And you shall see from
a sober person, to whom we owe this relation, what a good man
this is whom the Conspiracy reviled. Reviled indeed, but basely,
for when the Arch-bishop answered, <hi>That he thought Doctor</hi> Jackson
<hi>Learned, Honest and Orthodox:</hi> It was replyed, <hi>That though Learned
and Honest, he was an</hi> Arminian. <hi>Bonus vir, Cajus sejus in hoc tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
malus quod Christianus.</hi> A man you will see, of whom that Age
was not worthy.</p>
            <p>He was descended from a very worthy Family, in the Bishoprick
of <hi>Durham,</hi> his life seemed to be Consecrated to Vertue and Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Arts, from his very Child-hood: He had a natural propensity
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Learning, from which no other recreation or imployment could
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59370:43"/>
divert him, he was first designed (by his Parents) to be a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
in <hi>New-castle,</hi> where many of his near Friends and Aliance,
lived in great wealth and prosperity; but neither could that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation
lay hold upon him.</p>
            <p>Therefore (at the instance of a <hi>Noble Lord,</hi> the Load <hi>Eure</hi>) he
was sent to <hi>the Vniversity</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> for which highly esteemed fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vours
he returns his solemn thanks in the very <hi>first words,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trance
of one of his books: He was first planted in <hi>Queens Colledge,</hi>
under the Care and Tuition of the propound Doctor <hi>Grakanthorn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
and from thence removed to <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had no notice of the Vacancy of the Place, till the day
before the Election, yet he answered with so much readiness and
applause, that he gained the Admiration, as well as the Suffrages
of the Electors, and was Chosen with full consent, although they
had received Letters of Favour from <hi>great</hi> Men to another <hi>Scholar.</hi>
A sure and honourable argument of the incorruptedness of that
place, when the peremptory <hi>Mandamus</hi> of the pious Founder,
<hi>nec prece, nec pretio,</hi> presented with the merits of a young man
and stranger, shall prevail more then all other solicitations and
partialities whatsoever: This resolution hath been often assured
unto me from one of the Electors (yet living) Master <hi>Iohn Hore</hi> of
<hi>West-hendred,</hi> a man of reverend years and goodness. There was
now a welcome necessity laid upon him, to preserve the high opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which was conceived of him, which he did in a studious and
exemplary life, not subject to the usual intemperance of that age.
Certainly the Devil could not find him idle, nor at leisure to have
the suggestions of Vice whispered into his Ear. And although
many in their youthful times have their deviations and exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces,
which afterwards prove reformed, and excellent men; yet
it pleased God to keep him in a constant path of vertue and piety.
He had not been long admitted into this place, but that he was
made more precious, and better estimated by all that knew him,
by the very danger that they were in suddenly to part with him;
For walking out with others of the younger company to wash
himself, he was in eminent peril of being drowned. <hi>The depth
closed him round about, the weeds were wrapt about his Head. He went
down to the bottom of the mountains, the Earth with her Bars was about
him for ever, yet God brought his soul from corruption,</hi> Jonah 2. 5, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.
That (like <hi>Moses</hi> from the Flags) for the future good of the Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and government of the Colledge where he lived, there might be
preserved the meekest man alive, or (like <hi>Ionas</hi>) <hi>There might be a
Prophet revived</hi> (as afterwards he proved) <hi>to forewarn the people of
ensuing destruction,</hi> if peradventure they might repent, and God
might revoke the judgments pronounced against them, and spare
this great and sinful Nation. It was a long (and almost incredible)
space of time wherein he lay under water, and before a Boat could
be procured, which was sent for, rather to take out his Body (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it floated) for a decent Funeral, then out of hopes of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Life. The Boat-man discerning where he was by the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the Water (the last signs of a man expiring) thrust down
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59370:44"/>
his hook at that very moment, which by happy providence (at
the first essay) lighted under his arm, and brought him up into
the Boat. All the parts of his body were swollen to a vast propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and though by holding his head downward they let forth
much water, yet no hopes of life appeared. Therefore they
brought him to the land, and lapped him up in the Gowns of his
Fellow-Students, the best Shrowd that Love or Necessity could
provide.</p>
            <p>After some warmth, and former means renewed, they perceiv'd
that life was yet within him, conveyed him to the Colledge, and
commended him to the skill of Doctor <hi>Channel,</hi> an eminent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
of the same House, where, with much care, time, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
he recovered, to the equal joy and wonder of the whole
Society. All men concluded him to be reserved for high and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
purposes. His grateful Acknowledgments towards the
Fisher-man and his Servants that took him up, knew no limits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a constant Revenue to them while he lived. For his thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to Almighty God, no heart could conceive, nor tongue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it but his own, often commemorating the miracle of Divine
Mercy in his deliverances, and resolving hereafter <hi>not to live to
himself, but to God that raiseth the dead.</hi> Neither did he serve God
<hi>with that which cost him nothing;</hi> I must rank his abundant Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and riches of his Liberalities amongst the Vertues of his first
years, as if he would strive with his Friends, Patron, and Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
<hi>Vtruum illi largiendo, an ipse dispergendo vinceret,</hi> whether
they shall be more bountiful in giving, or he in dispersing; or,
that he was resolved to pay the ransome of his life into God's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checquer,
which is the bodies of the poor. His heart was so free
and enlarged in this kind, that very often his Alms-deed made him
more rich that received, than it left him that gave it. His progress
in the study of Divinity was something early, because (as he well
considered) the journey that he intended was very far, yet not
without large and good provisions for the way. No man made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
use of Humane Knowledge, in subserviency to the Eternal
Truths of God, produced more testimonies of Heathens to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
themselves, and make them submit the rich Presents of their
Wise-men, to the Cradle and Cross of Christ. He was furnished
with all the learned Languages, Arts, and Sciences, as the praevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dispositions, or <hi>beautiful</hi> Gate which led him to the Temple;
but especially <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> as the next in attendance, and most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<hi>handmaid</hi> to Divinity, which was the Mistress where all his
thoughts were fixed, being wholly taken up with the love and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of Jesus Christ, and him crucified. The reading to youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Scholars, and some Employments imposed by the Founder,
were rather recreations and assistances, than divertisements from
that intended work. The Offices which (out of duty, not desire)
were never the most profitable, but the most ingenuous, not such
as might fill his purse, but increase his knowledge. It was no small
accession of respect unto him (or rather a consequent of the good
repute which he had already gained) that those two Noble Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59370:44"/>
(Mr. <hi>Edward,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Richard Spencers,</hi> Sons to the <hi>Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Robert, Lord Spencer, Baron of Wormleighton</hi>) were commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to his charge, whom he restored fully instructed with all good
Literature, the glory of learned and religious Nobility, and the
very Ornaments of the Countrey where they lived; for which
faithful discharge of his great trust, he (and his Memory) were
ever in singular veneration with that whole Family, and their Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.
His Discourse was very facetious (without offence) when
time and place, and equality of persons permitted it. He was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tregent
(as our neighbours speak it) a man (upon occasions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered)
of <hi>Vniversal Conversation.</hi> When he was chosen into Office,
the Governour of the Colledge was wont to give this testimony of
him, <hi>That he was a man most sincere in Elections:</hi> and that in a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious
victory of younger wits, it was the safest experiment for an
happy choice, to follow the <hi>Omen</hi> of his <hi>Iudgment.</hi> He read a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Divinity in the <hi>Colledge</hi> every Sunday morning, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day of the week at <hi>Pembroke Colledge</hi> (then newly erected) by
the instance of the Master, and Fellows there. He was chosen
Vice-President for many years together, who by his place was to
moderate the Disputations in Divinity. In all these he demeaned
himself with great depth of Learning, far from that knowledge
which puffeth up, but accompanied with all gentleness, courtesie,
humility, and moderation. From the Colledge, he was preferred
to a Living in the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham</hi> (in their Donation) and
from thence (with consent from the same Colledge obtained,
where no request could be denied him) removed to the Vicarage
of <hi>Newcastle,</hi> a very populous Town, furnished with multitudes of
men, and no small variety of opinions. It was a difficult task (and
onely worthy of so pious an Undertaker) so to become all things
to all men, that by all means he might gain some. This was the
place where he was appointed by his Friends to be a Merchant, but
he chose rather to be a Factor for Heaven. One precious soul refi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned,
pollished, and fitted for his Masters use, presented by him,
was of more value to him, than all other purchases whatsoever.
He adorned the Doctrine of the Gospel (which he preached and
professed) with a sutable Life and Conversation, manifesting the
signes of a true Apostle; in all things shewing himself a pattern of
good works; in Doctrine, incorruptness, gravity, sincerity, sound
speech that cannot be condemned, that they which were of the
<q>contrary part might be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of him,

            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">I lately received Letters (saith the worthy Compiler of his
Life) from a Gentleman, who lived there at the same time with
him, who gave this Testimony of him, He was a man very stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
humble, courteous, and charitable.</hi> At <hi>Newcastle</hi> (when
he went out) what money he had, he usually gave to the Poor,
who at length flocked so unto him, that his Servant took care that
he had not too much in his pocket. At a certain time Doctor <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson,</hi>
the Town's Physician, his neighbour and intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
(having made a Purchase) sitting sad by him, and fetching
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59370:45"/>
a sigh, he demanded what was the reason; he said, that he had a
payment to make, and wanted Money: Doctor <hi>Iackson</hi> bade him
be of a good chear, for he would furnish him; and calling for his
Servant, told him the Physician's need, and asked what money he
had. The man stepping back silent, the Doctor bid's him speak;
at length the man said, fourty shillings; he bade him fetch it, for
Master <hi>Henderson</hi> should have it all: at which Master <hi>Henderson</hi>
turned his sadness into laughter. Doctor <hi>Iackson</hi> demanded his
reason; he said he had need of 400 or 500 pound. Doctor <hi>Iackson</hi>
answered, that he thought fourty shillings to be a great sum, and
that he should have it, and more also if he had had it. Thus in a
place of busie Trade and Commerce, his mind was intent upon
better things, willing to spend and to be spent for them, not seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theirs, but them. After some years of his continuance in this
Town, he was invited back again to the University by the death
of the President of the same Colledge, being chosen in his absence
at so great a distance, so unexpectedly without any suit or petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon his part, for he knew nothing of the vacancy of the Place,
but by the same Letters that informed him that it was conferred
upon himself: A preferment of so good account, that it hath
been much desired, and eagerly sought after by many eminent
men, but never before went so far to be accepted of. Upon his
return to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and admission to his Government, they found no
alteration by his long absence, and more converse with the world,
but that he appeared yet more <hi>humble</hi> in his elder times; and this
not out of coldness and admission of spirit, but from a prudent
choice and experience of a better way: not without a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Paul</hi> the aged, who when he had Authority to command
that which is convenient (yet for love's sake) chose rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech,
Epistle to <hi>Philemon.</hi> He ruled in a most obliging manner, the
Fellows, Scholars, Servants, Tenants, <hi>Nemo ab eo tristis discessit,</hi> no
man departed from him with a sad heart, excepting in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
that by some misdemeanour, or willing errour, they had
created trouble, or given any offence unto him. He used the
Friends, as well as the Memory of his Predecessors fairly. He was
<hi>Presidents pacificus,</hi> a lover and maker of peace. He silenced and
composed all differences, displeasures, and animosities, by a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
impartiality, and the example of his own sweet disposition.
All men taking notice that nothing was more hateful than hatred
it self, nothing more offensive to his body and mind, it was a
shame and cruelty (as well as presumption) to afflict his peaceable
spirit. It is a new and peculiar Art of Discipline, but successfully
practised by him, that those under his Authority were kept within
bounds and order, not so much out of fear of the penalty, as out
of love to the Governour. He took notice of that which was good
in the worst men, and made that an occasion to commend them
for the good sake; and living himself, <hi>tanquam nemini ignosceret,</hi>
as if he were so severe, that he could forgive no man, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
large pardons for the imperfections of others. His nature
was wholly composed of the properties of Charity it self. <hi>Charity
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59370:45"/>
suffereth long, and is kinde, beareth all things, believeth all things,
hopeth all things, endureth all things.</hi> I can truely avouch this
Testimony concerning him, That living in the same Colledge with
him more than twenty years (partly when he was Fellow, and
partly when he returned President) I never heard (to my best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance)
one word of anger, or dislike against him. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
resembled him in my thoughts (with favour of that Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Person) to him (whose name sounds very near him) who
being placed in the upper part of the World, carried on his Dig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nity
with that justice, modesty, integrity, fidelity, and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
plausibilities, that in a place of trust, he contented those
whom he could not satisfie; and in a place of envie, procured the
love of them who emulated his Greatness, and by his example,
shewed the preheminence and security of true Christian Wisdom,
before all sleights of humane policy, that in a busie time no man
was found to accuse him; so this good man (in that inferiour Orb
which God had placed him) demeaned himself with that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
clemency, candor, wisdome, and modesty, that malice it self
was more wary than to cast any aspersions upon him. I shall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
associate him to those other Worthies his Predecessors in the
same Colledge (all living at the same time) to the invaluable Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Iewel, Theologorum quas Orbis Christianus per aliquot annorum
Centenario produxit maximo,</hi> as grave Bishop <hi>Goodwin</hi> hath descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
him, The greatest Divine that for some former Centuries of
years the Christian World hath produced. To the famous Master
<hi>Hooker,</hi> who for his solid Writings was surnamed <hi>The Iudicious,</hi> and
entituled by the same, <hi>Theologorum Oxonium,</hi> the <hi>Oxford</hi> of Divines,
as one calls <hi>Athens,</hi> The <hi>Greece</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> it self. To the learned Dr.
<hi>Reynolds,</hi> who managed the Government of the same Colledge,
with the like care, honour, and integrity, although not with the
same austerities. He willingly admitted (and was much delighted
in) acquaintance and familiarity of hopeful young Divines, not
despising their Youth, but accounting them as Sons and Brethren,
encouraging and advising them what Books to read, and with what
holy preparations, lending them such Books as they have need of,
and hoping withal, that (considering the brevity of his own life)
some of them might live to finish that Work upon the Creed, which
he had happily begun unto them. This was one of the special Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
and Directions which he commanded to young men, Hear
the dictates of your own Conscience; <hi>Quod dubitas ne feceris,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
this the Comment upon that of <hi>Syracides,</hi> In all thy matters
trust (or believe) thine own soul, and bear it not down by impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and contradictuous lusts, &amp;c. He was as diffusive of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
counsel, and advice, as of any other his works of mercy.</p>
            <p>In all the Histories of Learned, Pious and Devout Men, you
shall scarcely meet with one that disdained the world more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously;
not out of ignorance of it, as one brought up in cells and
darkness, for he was known and endeared to men of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendent
fortunes, nor out of melancholy disposition; for he
was chearful and content in all estates, but out of a due and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59370:46"/>
scorn, knowing the true value, that is, the vanity of it.
As preferments were heaped upon him without his suit or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
so there was nothing in his power to give, which he was
not ready and willing to part withal, to the deserving and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
man.
His Vicarage of Saint <hi>Nicholas Church</hi> in <hi>New-Castle,</hi> he
gave to Master <hi>Alveye</hi> of <hi>Trinity Colledge,</hi> upon no other relation,
but out of the good opinion which he conceived of his merits.
The Vicarage of <hi>Wetney</hi> near <hi>Oxford,</hi> after he had been at much
pains, travail and expence, to clear the Title of the Rectory to all
succeeding Ministers, when he had made a portion fitting either
to give or keep, he freely bestowed it upon the worthy Master
<hi>Thomas White,</hi> then Proctor of the University, late Chaplain to the
Colledge, and now incumbent upon the Rectory. A Colledge
Lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, of a place called <hi>Lye</hi> in <hi>Gloucestershire,</hi> presented to him as a
Gratuity by the Fellows, he made over to a third (late Fellow
there) meerly upon a plea of poverty, and whereas they that first
offered it unto him, were unwilling that he should relinquish it,
and held out for a long time in a dutiful opposition, he used all
his power, friendship and importunity with them, till at length he
prevailed to surrender it.</p>
            <p>Many of his necessary friends and attendants have professed,
that they have made several journeys, and employed all powerful
mediation with the Bishop, that he might not be suffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
his Prebendship of <hi>Winchester</hi> to a fourth; and upon acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
(that by their continuance he was disappointed of his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
herein) he was much offended that the <hi>Manus mortua,</hi> or <hi>Law
of Mortmain</hi> should be imposed upon him, whereby in former
days they restrained the liberality of devout men towards the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and the Clergy. But this was interpreted as a discourtesie
and dis-service unto him, who knew it was a <hi>more blessed thing to
give than to receive.</hi> But that which remained unto him, was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
unto the poor, to whom he was faithful dispenser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in all
places of his abode, distributing unto them with a Free Heart, a
Bountiful Hand, a Comfortable Speech, and a Cheerful Eye.</p>
            <p>How dis-respectful was he of <hi>Mammon,</hi> the God of this World,
the Golden Image which Kings and Potentates have set up? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom the Trumpets play for War and Slaughter, and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Languages fall down and worship, besides all other kind
of Musick for jollity and delight, to drown (if it were possible)
the noise of bloud, which is most audiable, and cries loudest in
the ears of the Almighty. How easily could he cast that away,
for which others throw away their lives and salvation, running
head-long into the place of eternal skreekings, weeping and
gnashing of teeth. If it were not for this spirit of covetousness,
all the world would be at quiet. Certainly (although the nature
of man be an apt soil for sin to flourish in, yet) <hi>if the love of money
be the root of all evil,</hi> it could not grow up in him, <hi>because it had no
root:</hi> And if it be so hard to a rich man to enter into the kingdom
of God, and the Narrow Gate which leads unto life; then he that
stooped so low, by humbleness of mind, and emptied himself so
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59370:46"/>
nearly by mercifulness unto the poor, must needs find an easier
passage; doubtless, they that say and do these things, shew plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they seek another Country, that is, an Heavenly; for if
they had been mindful of <hi>this,</hi> they might have taken opportunity
to have used it more advantageously.</p>
            <p>His devotions towards God were assiduous and exemplary, both
in publick and private. He was a diligent frequenter of the pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lick
service in the Chappel, very early in the morning and at even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
except some urgent occasions of infirmity did excuse him.
His private conferences with God by prayer and meditations, were
never omitted upon any occasion whatsoever.</p>
            <p>When he went the yearly Progress to view <hi>the Colledge Lands,</hi>
and came into the Tenants houses, it was his constant custome (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any other business, discourse, or care of himself, were he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so wet or weary) to call for a retire Room to pour out his soul
unto God, who led him safely in his journey. And this he did
not out of any specious pretence of holiness, to devour a Widows
House with more facility, Rack their Rents, or Change their Fines;
for excepting the constant Revenue to the Founder (to whom he
was a strict accountant) no man ever did more for them, or less for
himself. For thirty years together he used this following Anthem,
and Confession of the holy and undivided Trinity. <hi>Salva nos, libera
nos, vivifica nos, Obeat a Trinit as:</hi> Save us, deliver us, quicken us, Obles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Trinity. Let us praise God the Father, and the Son, with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit; let us praise and super-exalt his name for ever. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
and everlasting God, which hast given us, thy Servants, grace by
the confession of a true faith, to acknowledge the glory of the Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and in the power of the Divine Majesty to worship the Vnity: We
beseech thee, that through the stedfastness of this faith, we may ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
be defended from all adversity, which livest and raignest,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This he did perform, not only as a sacred Injunction of the
Founder (upon him and all the Society) but he received a great
delight in the performance of it. No man ever wrote more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Attributes of God than he, and yet he professes that he
always took more comfort in admiring, than in disputing, and in

                  </gap>rinity,</hi> than by too curiously prying into the <hi>Mystery.</hi> He
composed a book of <hi>Private Devotions,</hi> which some judicious men
(having perused the same) much extolled and admired, as being
replenished with <hi>holy truths</hi> and <hi>divine meditations,</hi> which (if it be
not already annexed to this book) I hope the Reader will shortly
enjoy in a portable Volumn by it self.</p>
            <p>Thus have many Scholars and Polemical men (in their elder
times) betaken themselves to Catechizing and Devotion, as <hi>Pareus,</hi>
Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Bishop <hi>Vsher;</hi> and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself seems to prefer
this Book, <hi>De ascensione mentis ad Deum,</hi> Of the ascension of the
soul to God, before any other parts of his works. Books (saith
he) are not to be estimated, <hi>Ex multitudine folliorum, sed ex fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
By the multitudes of the leaves, but the fruit. My other
books I read only upon necessity, but this I have willingly read
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59370:47"/>
over three or four times, and resolve to read it more often; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be (saith he) that the love towards it be greater than the
merit, because (like another <hi>Benjamin)</hi> it was the Son of mine old
age.</p>
            <p>He seemed to be very Prophetical of the ensuing times of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as may evidently appear by his Sermons before the King, and
Appendix about the signs of the times, or divine fore-warnings
therewith Printed some years before, touching the great tempest
of wind, which fell upon the Eve of the fifth of <hi>November</hi> 1636.
He was much astonished at it, and what apprehension he had of it
appears by his words.—<hi>This mighty wind was more then a sign of
the time; the very time it self was a sign, and portends thus much, that
though we of this kingdom were in firm league with all Nations, yet it
is still in God's power, we may fear, in his purpose to plague this kingdom,
by this or like tempests, more grievcously then he hath done at any time
by Famine, Sword or Pestilence, to bury many living souls, as well of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
as inferior rank, in the ruine of their stately Houses or meaner
Cottages,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Which was observed by many, but signally by the Preface to
Master <hi>Herberts Remains;</hi> I shall not prevent the Reader, or detain
him so long from the original of that book, as to repeat Elogies,
which are there conferred upon him. I cannot forbear one passage
in that Preface, wherein he made this profession; <hi>I speak it in the
presence of God, I have not read so hearty, vigorous a Champion against</hi>
Rome <hi>(amongst our Writers in this rank) so convincing and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
as Dr.</hi> Jackson <hi>is. I bless God for the confirmation he hath given
me in the Christian religion against the Atheist, Iew and Socinian, and
in the Protestant, against</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>As he was always a reconciler of differences in the private go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
so he seriously lamented the publick breaches of the
kingdom: for the divisions of <hi>Reuben</hi> he had great thoughts of
heart. At the first entrance of the <hi>Scots</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> he had much
compassion for his Country-men, although that were but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of their sorrows. He well knew that war was commonly
attended with ruin and calamity, especially to Church and
Churches, and therefore that prayer was necessary and becoming
of them, <hi>Da pacem Domine in diebus nostris,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Give peace in our
time, O Lord, because there is none other that fighteth for us, but only
thou, O God.</hi> One drop of Christian blood (though never so
cheaply spilt by others, like water upon the ground) was a deep
corrosive to his tender heart. Like <hi>Rachel</hi> weeping for her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
he could not be comforted: his body grew weak, the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hue of his countenance was empaled and discoloured, and he
walked like a dying mourner in the streets. But God took him
from the evil to come, it was a sufficient degree of punishment to
him to see it; it had been more than a thousand deaths unto him
to have beheld it with his eyes.</p>
            <p>When his death was now approaching, being in the Chamber
with many others, I over-heard him with a soft voice repeating to
himself these and the like ejaculations. <hi>I wait for the Lord, my soul
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59370:47"/>
doth wait, and in his word do I hope; my soul wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eth for the Lord
more than they that watch for the morning. As for me, I will behold thy
face in right cousness, I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness.</hi>
And he ended with this <hi>Cygnean caution,</hi> Psal. 116. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Cracious
is the Lord and righteous, yea, our God is merciful. The Lord preserveth
the simple, I was brought low and he helped me. Return unto thy rest, O
my soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee.</hi> And having
thus spoken, soon after he surrendred up his spirit to him that
gave it.</p>
            <p>If you shall enquire what this charitable man left in Legacy at
his Death, I must needs answer: That giving all in his life time, as
he owed nothing but love, so he left nothing when he dyed. The
poor was his heir, and he was the administrator of his own goods;
or (to use his own expression in one of his last Dedications) he
had little else to leave his Executors, but his Pape<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> only, which
the Bishop of <hi>Armagh</hi> (being at his Funeral) much desired might
be carefully preserved. This was that which he left to posterity
in <hi>pios usus,</hi> for the furtherance of piety and godliness, <hi>in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuam

the Reader will advance to the utmost improvement.</p>

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
FRANCIS Lord COTTINGTON.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>Francis Cottington</hi> being bred a youth under un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Sir <hi>Stafford,</hi> lived so long in <hi>Spain,</hi> till
he made the garb and gravity of that Nation become
his, and become him too. He raised himself by his
natural strength, without any artificial advantage;
having his parts above his learning, his experience,
and (some will say) his success above all; so that at last he became
Chancellour of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> Baron of <hi>Hanworth</hi> in <hi>Middlesex,</hi>
Constable of the <hi>Tower,</hi> 1640: and (upon the resignation of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Iuxon</hi>) Lord Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> gaining also a very great
estate.</p>
            <p>Very reserved he was in his temper, and very slow in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
sticking to some private principles in both, and aiming
at certain rules in all things: A temper that endeared him as
much to his Master, Prince <hi>Charles</hi> his Person, as his integrity did
to his Service; nor to his Service only, but to that of the whole
Nation; in the merchandize whereof he was well versed, to the
trade whereof he was very serviceable many ways, but eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in that he negotiated that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Treasure, which was used
to be sent to <hi>Flanders</hi> by the way of <hi>Genoa,</hi> might be sent in <hi>English</hi>
Bottoms, exceedingly enriched <hi>England</hi> for the time, and had it
continued, it had made her the greatest Bank and Mart for Gold
and Silver, of any Commonwealth in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, the advantage of his Education, the different Nations
and Factions that he had to deal with, the direst opposition of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
the treachery of friends, the contracts of States-men, the
variety and force of experience from the chief Ministers of State,
with their Intrigues of Government, made him so expert, that
the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Aston</hi> could do nothing without
him, and he only could finish the Treaty, which they had for many
years spun out.</p>
            <p>Men take several ways for the ends they propose themselves,
some, that of <hi>confidence;</hi> others, that of <hi>respect</hi> and <hi>caution,</hi> &amp;c.
when indeed the main business is, to suit our selves with our own
times, which this Lord did, and no man better, until looking into
the depths of the late Faction, he declared at the Council-table,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59370:48"/>
1639. <hi>That they aimed at the ruin of Church and State.</hi> And viewing
the state of the kingdom, he advised; <hi>That Leagues might be made
abroad;</hi> and, <hi>that in this inevitable necessity, all ways to raise money
should be used that were lawful.</hi> Wherefore he was one of those few
that excluded the Indempnity by the Faction, and had the honour
to dye Banished for the best Cause and Master, in those Forraign
Countries; where he suffered as nobly for the Crown of <hi>England</hi>
in his latter days, as he had acted honourably for it in his former.
When he never came off better than in satisfying the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
about Tolleration, reducing the whole of that affair to these two
Maximes.</p>
            <p>1. That Consciences were not to be forced, but to be won and
reduced by the evidence of truth, with the aid of Reason, and in
the use of all good means of Instruction and Perswasion.</p>
            <p>2. That the causes of Conscience, wherein they exceed their
bounds, and grow to matter of Faction, lose their nature: and
that Sovereign Princes ought diligently to punish those foul pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
though over-laid with the fairer pretences of Conscience
and Religion.</p>
            <p>One of his Maximes for Treaty, I think remarkable, <hi>viz. That
kingdoms are more subject to fear than hope,</hi> and that it's safer work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon them by a power that may awe the one, than by advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
that may excite the other. Since it's another rule, That
States have no affection but interest, and that all kindnesses and
civilities in those cases, are but <hi>oversights</hi> and <hi>weakness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of his rules of Life I judge useful, <hi>viz.</hi> That since no
man is absolute in all points, and since men are more naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
out of <hi>envy</hi> to observe mens <hi>infirmities,</hi> than out of <hi>inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity</hi>
to acknowledge their <hi>merit;</hi> he discovereth his abilities <hi>most,</hi>
that <hi>least</hi> discovereth <hi>himself.</hi> To which I may add another, <hi>viz.</hi>
That it is not only our known duty, but our visible advantage, to
ascribe our most eminent performances to Providence, since it
not only takes off the edge of envy, but improves the reason of
admiration. None being less maliced, or more applauded than
he, who is thought rather happy, than able; blessed, than active;
and fortunate, than cunning.</p>
            <p>Though yet all the caution of his life could not avoid the envy
of his advancement, from so mean a beginning to so great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
notwithstanding that it is no disparagement to any to give
place to fresh Nobility, who ascend the same steps with those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them. <hi>New</hi> being only a term, saith one, only respecting us,
not the world; for what is, was before us, and will be when we
are no more: And indeed this personage considering the vanity
and inconstancy of common applause or affronts, improved the
one, and checked the other, by a constant neglect of both.</p>
            <p>Three things inraged the Faction against him. 1. His atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on his Majesty when Prince, as his Secretary in his Journey
to <hi>Spain.</hi> 2. His activity in promoting the King's Revenue and
Trade. And 3. His great insight into the bottome of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy.
In the first, whereof he acted only as a discreet Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59370:49"/>
observing more Intrigues, and offering several Considerations,
especially of address, formality and caution, that escaped greater
persons: In the second, as a faithful Counsellor, by the same token,
that he had the fairer quarter of some adversaries, because in the
management of the Revenue, and the vacancy between the Lord
Treasurer <hi>Weston</hi>'s death, and the Lord Treasurer <hi>Iuxon</hi>'s advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to that trust, he had some misunderstanding with my Lord
Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And the King in an Express to the
Queen, <hi>Ian.</hi> 23. 1642. speaking of competitions for Offices, hath
these gracious syllables in behalf of this Lord: <hi>Digby</hi> and <hi>Duns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
look for the Captainship of the Pensioners;</hi> Hertford <hi>once looked
after it, but now I believe he expects either to be Treasurer, or of my
Bed-chamber; I incline rather to the later, if thou like it, for I abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
hold</hi> Cottington <hi>the fittest man for the other.</hi> And in a third,
as a wise States-man, that was not to be abused with umbrages.
When the Rebellion seized on other mens Estates, it looked for a
greater Treasure with my Lord <hi>Cottington</hi>'s A B C, and Sir <hi>F. W.</hi>
taking all their Papers.</p>
            <p>Indeed this Lord sent such a Reply to some harangues of the
House of Commons against him, as could not be Answered, but by
suppressing both their Charge and his Answer: an essay of the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes</hi>
valour, who being struck down with a mortal blow, used to
stop their mouths with earth, that they might not be heard to
quetch or groan, thereby to affright their fellows, or animate their
enemies. And to prepare the way for his ruin, the most opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
parts of his accusation were first whispered among the popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
<hi rend="margQuotes">That by this seeming suppression, men impatient of secrecy,
might more eagerly divulge them, &amp; the danger appear greater
by an affected silence:</hi> Besides, the calumnies, and the suspitions
were so contrived, as might force him and others to some course in
their own defence, which they hitherto forbore; and by securing
themselves to increase the publick fears. For the slanders fixed upon
the King's Party, were designed rather to provoke than to amend
them, that being provoked, they might think rather to provide for
their security, than to adjust their actions, in a time when the most
innocent man living was not safe, if either wise or honest.</p>
            <p>Indeed he sate among the Faction at <hi>Westminster,</hi> so long as he
had any hope of keeping them within any reasonable terms of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
untill he and others saw that their longer continuance
amongst them, might countenance their confederacy, but neither
prevent, nor so much as allay their practises; <hi rend="margQuotes">And therefore among
many eminent examples of loyalty and virtue of the noblest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
and fairest estates in <hi>England,</hi> of which they could not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suspect to be divested without an absolute overthrow of all
the Laws of right and wrong, which was to be feared only by
their Invasion on the Kings most undoubted Rights: (for when
Majesty it self is assaulted, there can be no security for private
fortunes; and those that decline upon design from the paths
of equity, will never rest till they come to the extremity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</hi>)
We find him with the King at <hi>York,</hi> where the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59370:49"/>
that he will not require any obedience from them, but by
the Law of the Land. That he will Protect them from any illegal
Impositions in the profession of the true Protestant Religion, the
just Liberty of the Subject, and the undoubted Priviledge of the
three Estates of Parliament. That he will not Engage them in any
War, except for necessary defence against such as invade him, on
them. And he with others subscribing a Protestation to live and dye
with the King, according to their Allegiance, in defence of Religion
and Laws, together with the prosperity and peace of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>But this Resolution without treasure would not take effect, and
therefore the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy, and both Universities, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
his Majesty with treasure, chusing rather to lay out then
estates for the supply of his Majesty, than expose them to the lusts
and usurpations of a Conspiracy. And yet treasure without a
Treasurer could not at that time be either preserved or managed.
and my Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> had been so good a husband for <hi>himself,</hi>
that he was looked on in a time when his Majesties occasions were
so craving, and suppy so uncertain, as the fittest Steward for his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</hi>
Being so rich, that he would not abuse his Majesty himself,
and so knowing, that he would not suffer others to do it. The
Souldiery would have their flings at him for being so close in his
advises, and wary in his place at <hi>Oxford:</hi> 
               <hi rend="margQuotes">But he understood that
in vain do the Brows beat and frown, the Eyes sparkle, the
Tongue rant, the Fist bend, and the Arm swing, except care be
taken that the Belly be fed.</hi> But when it pleased God that the best
Cause had the worst success, and his Sacred Majesty more solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
for his friends safety than his own, chusing to venture himself
upon further hazzards, rather than expose their resolute Loyalty
to all extremities, directed his followers to make as good terms of
peace as they could, since it was in vain to linger out the war; This
Lord, among others (whom when fortune failed, their courage
stood to) had the contrivance first, and afterwards the benefit of
the <hi>Oxford</hi> Articles, so far as the forfeiture of all his estate, (most
part whereof came to <hi>Bradshaw</hi>'s share) perpetual Banishment, but
withal an opportunity to serve his Gracious Master in his old ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
of Ambassador to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> in Joint Commission

whose abilities and experience could have done more than
they did, had not interest been more with Princes, than honour;
and present accommodations beyond future advantages: Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
that made it more adviseable for this ancient Lord, <hi>Cum
satis naturae, satisque patriae, &amp; gloriae vixisset;</hi> to prepare himself
rather to dye in peace with God, than to concern himself in the
affairs of men; of which he said (as it is reported) when some
<hi>English</hi> Mercuries were offered him, that he would peruse, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
on them, when he could find some of the <hi>Rabbines</hi> hours
which belonged neither to day nor night. So much longed he for
the grave, where the weary are at rest, and that world where all

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Sir IOHN BRAMSTON.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>Iohn Bramston</hi> Knight, was born at <hi>Maldon</hi> in
<hi>Essex,</hi> bred up in the Middle. Temple, in the Study of
the Common-law, wherein he attained to such emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
that he was by King <hi>Charles</hi> made Lord Chief
Justice of the <hi>Kings-bench.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of Deep Learning, Solid Judgement, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
of Life, Gravity of Behaviour, above the Envy of his own
Age, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> candal of Posterity. One instance of his I must not
forget, writes the Historian effectually, relating to the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wherein I was bred. Serjeant <hi>Bruerton</hi> by Will bequeathed to
<hi>Sidney</hi> Colledge, well nigh three thousand pounds, but (for haste,
or some other accident) it was so imperfectly done, that (as Doctor
<hi>Samuel VVard</hi> informed me) it was invalid in the rigour of the Law.
Now Judge <hi>Bramston,</hi> who married the Serjeant's Widdow, gave
himself much trouble (gave himself indeed, doing all things <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>)
for the speedy payment of the money to a farthing, and the
legal settling thereof on the Colledge, according to the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the dead. He deserved to live in better times. The
delivering his judgement on the King's side, in the case of Ship-money,
cost him much trouble, and brought him much honour, as
who understood the consequence of that Maxime, <hi>Salus populi
suprema lex;</hi> and that Ship-money was thought legal by the best
Lawyers, Voted down Arbitrarily by the worst Parliament, they
hearing no Council for it, though the King heard all men willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against it. Yea, that Parliament thought themselves not secure
from it, unless the King renounced his right to it by a new Act of
his own. Men have a touch-stone to try gold, and gold is the
touch-stone to try men. Sir <hi>VVilliam Noy</hi>'s gratuity shewed, that this
Judges inclination was as much above corruption, as his fortune;
and that he would not, as well he needed not, be base. Equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was he upon the Interest of State and Maxims of Law, as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59370:50"/>
which mutually supported each other. He would never have a
witness interrupted, or helped, but have the patience to hear a
naked, though a tedious truth; the best Gold lieth in the most
Ore, and the clearest truth in the most simple discourse. When he
put on his Robes, he put off respects; his private affections being
swallowed up in the publick service. This was the Judge whom
Popularity could never flatter to any thing unsafe, nor Favour
oblige to any thing unjust. Therefore he died in peace 1645, when
all others were engaged in a War, and shall have the reward of

A great man managed a quarrel with <hi>Archee</hi> the King's Fool; but
by endeavouring to explode him the Court, rendred him at last so
considerable, by calling the enemies of that person (who were
not a few) to his rescue, as the fellow was not onely able to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the dispute for divers years, but received such encouragement
from standers by (the instrument of whose malice he was) as he
oft broke out into such reproaches, as neither the Dignity of that

in reason or manners admit.<note place="margin">F. O. <hi>p. 12.</hi>

            <p>And afterwards in the Lord <hi>Says</hi> Case, <hi>Ter. Hil. Anno 14. Car. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis
in Banco regis,</hi> with <hi>Iones</hi> and <hi>Berkley,</hi> to declare, That [the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Writ being allowed legal] the judgment of the Judges upon
it consisting of four branches. First, That the Writ was legal
by the King's Prerogative or at leastwise by his Regal power.
Secondly, That the Sheriff by himself, without any Jury, may
make the Assessement. Thirdly, That the Inland Counties ought
to do it at their own Charge, and to find Men, and Victualls out of
their Counties for the time in the Writ mentioned. Fourthly, That
the sum Assessed was a Duty, and (ought to be Assessed, and may
be Levied) ought to stand, until it were reversed in Parliament,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59370:51"/>
and until then, none ought to dispute against it. And when the
Parliament afterwards declared themselves, <hi>Hil. Term Anno</hi> 16. <hi>C. R.</hi>
in <hi>B. R.</hi> he was of opinion [in <hi>Chambers</hi> his Case against Sir <hi>Edward
Brumfield,</hi> late Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi>] that the Court ought
no longer to dispute of it. And yet in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1641. there was a
Charge brought against him for his Extra-judicial opinion for Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
of Ship-money; to which he made such a Rejoynder, as
though for malice they could not acquit, yet for shame they did
not condemn him, especially, since there were but few injured,
as they pretended, by that his opinion, and the whole kingdom
the better for his exact Justice; which was so effectual, that had he
lived a few years longer, there would have been not a Robber from
one end of the kingdom to the other, but <hi>such as took the High-way
by authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Large were the Harangues made against him and his brethren.
But as Bees are sometimes drowned in their Honey, so were their
Logick in their Rhetorick; the body of their proofs brings as poor
and lean, as the garnish of their words gaudy; the stuff as mean
as the dressing rich. After the affront of an Arrest, the trouble and
disgrace of an Imprisonment, and the charge of a Fine, or at least a
Gratuity, they thought it enough to have terrified, and so proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no farther to ruin this good man, that was the honour, and
would have been, if ill treated, the disgrace of his Nation. <hi>Eccius</hi>
is much censured by Divines, because he said in his <hi>Chrysopas</hi> that
he intreated of Reprobation as a fit subject, <hi>In quo Iuveniles Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lores
exerceret.</hi> Young Lawyers were much blamed by our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Judge, for chusing the deep and intricate points of Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Liberty, to be the matter of their young and undigested
Discourses; who while they engage against the old Laws and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes
of Government, notwithstanding all their bustle and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlings,
yet are discerned by impartial and judicious men, like
that <hi>Goth</hi> in <hi>Procopius,</hi> who though he fought fiercely, had the
mortal Arrows sticking in his Helmet, whereof he soon after fell.</p>
            <p>He died, as a Bishop of <hi>Oxford</hi> is said to do, at a time when he
had rather give an account of his Judges-place at the Tribunal
of God, than exercise it on a Bench awed by men. Since he could
not keep on the Robes of his Office with comfort, he put off those
of his Mortality with peace; being ashamed to live, as he would
say, when it was not safe to speak either law or reason, and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
it seasonable to dye when all things perished by him, and he
had nothing left him to do honestly, but to dye.</p>

of his opprobrious Preface against the Clergy in his Book
of <hi>Tythes,</hi> sending no less than eighty seven doubts, in several sorts
of learning, to be resolved by him. 4. The learned Bishop <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi>
meditating <hi>a Church History,</hi> equal <hi>to,</hi> if not above <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi>
consulted this great Antiquary; the familiarity between
them, when Master <hi>Gregory</hi> was but thirty years old, you have in
his own words, about the occasion of his Tract called, <hi>Episcopus
puerorum in die Innocentium. Having Consulted with the most likely men
I knew</hi> (where about I then was) <hi>to what Moment of Antiquity this</hi>
(speaking of the Monument afore mentioned in the Margin at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury)
could refer: The Answer was, They could not tell;</hi> so, <hi>the late

enquiry after the thing, not doubting but that there would be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the matter, at least of curious, if not substantial observation.</hi>
5. There was a Club of great wits at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that met twice a week
to consult this Oracle, than whom none communicated his Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
more readily, none expressed himself more satisfactorily;
wherefore the most learned Jews and Christians, Protestants and
Papists, kept correspondence with him, and an Armenian Priest
lodged with him some time at the Colledge, by the same Token
that he saith himself, <hi>He had occasion to shew this Priest the Chappel,
and perceiving him to cast his Eye upon the Organ, he asked whether there
were any such sight to be seen in their Churches? he answered, No such
matter, neither did he know, till it was told him, what to call them; yet
this man had lived fourteen years under two Patriarchs,</hi> Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

and good Disposition, whereof take this eminent instance.</p>
            <p>

morning, to Boil out the in-laid Rust thereof.</hi>

               <hi rend="margQuotes">Well (said the Doctor) I am sorry that the Cup of Union and

not, but that either the Thief out of remorse will restore the

Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> this Gentlemans Father's Master, and was a

from the year 1620. to the year 1640. carrying with him that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
of <hi>Cheshire</hi> Hospitality, and free to his own Family, which is
Generosity; to Strangers, which is Courtesie; and to the Poor,
which is Charity.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59370:55"/>
arising from his own grounds, both to serve himself and to supply
others, who, if poor, were in his house, as in their own.</p>
            <p>The peculiar grace of his charity, was that with the good man
in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> he would sometimes steal Largesses under the Pillows
of Ingenious Men, who otherwise might refuse them, relieving so
at once as well the modesty as the poverty of his Clients; not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting,
but preventing their request. <q>God forbid the Heavens

in his excellent Speech <hi>Octob.</hi> 13. 1660. before the King's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty

virtue so peculiar unto us, and so appropriated by Almighty God
to this Nation, that it can be translated into no other Language,
and hardly practised by any other People.</q> This good nature
was the praedominant temper of this good man, appearing in the
chearfulness of his spirit, the openness and freedom of his converse,
and his right English inclination, so that the spirit of fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
[that <hi>spiritus Calvinianus, spiritus Melancholicus</hi>] that prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the beginning of these times [like the louring of the Sky be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Storm] was as inconsistent with his temper and spirit, as it
was contrary to other sober persons opinion and interest. His first
disturbance was by some Croaking Lectures [the Product of the
extraordinary heat of that time out of the mud of Mankind] who
vied with him in long and thin discourses, in reference to whom
he would apply a Story he took much pleasure in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">When a Noble-man of this Nation, had a controversie in,

to put in so many Hogsheads of Water more into all his
Brewings than he was wont to do, telling him, that such a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
would bear the charge of his Suit with his Adversary; which
being over-heard by the Noble-man, he sent presently to the
Brewer, resolving he would no longer go to Law with him, who
upon such easie and cheap terms could manage his part of the
Suit.</hi> And when some ill-minded people thought to disturb the
peace of his soul, by the confluence that attended his Neighbour's

<hi>Priscillian,</hi> that the very Habit which good men used, if it
were such as <hi>Priscillian</hi> had used, made him hate them also; so it
was observed in those times, that any thing that was Episcopal was
so odious, that some men, whose Callings were much indeared by
the excellent endowments of their persons, had yet their persons
much disrespected by the common prejudices against their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Sir ROBERT BERKLEY.</head>
            <p>THE two great Boundaries that stood in the way
of the late Sedition, were Religion and Law,
which guide and regulate the main Springs that
move and govern the affections of reclaimed
nature, Conscience and Fear; by the first of
which, we are obliged as we live in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of those that hope for another world;
And by the second, as we live in society with those that keep in
order this. Ministers and Lawyers are the Oracles we depend
upon for Counsel and Instruction in both those Grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
so far as that we think it our duty to submit to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the one, and to believe the doctrine of the other, without
scruple or argument, unless in matters most notoriously repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the Elements of Policy and Religion. These two profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
the Conspiracy endeavoured to make sure of, either by cajo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or persecuting, drawing the one half of them to sin with them,
[oh what a case the Nation was in, when Juglers and Impostors
took up its Benches and Pulpits] and marking out the other half
for persecution by them: [miserable kingdom, where the Law
is Treason, and Gospel a Misdemeanor!] One of those that could
better endure the Injuries, than the Ways of the Faction, was Sir
<hi>Robert Berkley,</hi> a person whose worth was set in his Pedigree, as a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59370:56"/>
rich diamond in a fair Ring; his extraction not so much honouring
his parts, as his parts did illustrate his extraction. When a Pippin is
planted on a Pippin-stock, there groweth a delicious fruit upon it,
called <hi>a Renate.</hi> When eminent abilities meet with an eminent
person, the product of that happy concurrence is noble and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
The <hi>Heveninghams</hi> of <hi>Suffolk</hi> reckon twenty five Knights
of their Family; the <hi>Tilneys</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi> are not a little famous for
sixteen Knights successively in that House, and the <hi>Nauntons</hi> have
made a great noise in history; seven hundred pounds a year they
have injoyed ever since, or even before the Conquest. And this
person took a great pleasure in reflecting on the eight Lords, forty
two Knights, besides a great number of Gentlemen, that amongst
them, possess nine thousand pounds a year, for five hundred years
together. When he came to Study the Law, he knew that though
to have an Estate be a sure First, yet to have Learning is a sure Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
skill being no burthen to the greatest men; that being often
in his mouth in effect, which I find in another Judges Book in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
terms: <hi>Haec studia adolescentiam alunt, senectutem oblectunt,
secundas res ornant, adversis persugium praebent, delectant domi, non
impediunt foris: pernoctant nobiscum, Peregrinantur, Rusticantur.</hi> He
observed it a great happiness that he fixed on a profession, that was
as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith among the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> suited to his genius and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</p>
            <p>The reason of his considerable proficiency in his Profession,
being judged the greatest Master of Maximes in his time, and
therefore his only fault was, that being made Serjeant 3. <hi>Caroli</hi>
with great Solemnity, and at the same Term sworn the King's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Serjeant at Law, he argued against the factious Members
of the Parliament 4. <hi>Caroli,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Aliot,</hi> &amp;c. so shrewdly, that
Sir <hi>G. C.</hi> said of him, <hi>Prerogative and Law will not be over-run while
Serjeant</hi> Berkley <hi>lives.</hi> A testimony of him suitable to the inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on his ring when made Serjeant, <hi>Lege Deus, &amp; Rex.</hi> Two things
he abhorred. 1. The impudence of those men that by miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Laws, misapplying of Presidents, torturing or embez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeling
of Records, turn the point of the Law upon its self;
<hi>Wounding the Eagle with a feather from his own wing,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
the power of Princes by their authority. 2. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness
of others void of the ingenuity, either of Scholars,
or indeed of men, who charged him and others with opinions
which they heartily disclaimed, meerly because they think such
an opinion flowed from his Principles; an uncharitableness that
hath widened the breach irreconcilably among both Lawyers and
Divines in this Nation. This was the reason, why when the other
Judges were Charged with Misdeamenors [when the Parliament
was upon the business of Ship-money] this Judge was Accused of
Treason; and why when his fellows got off with a check and a
small Fine, he suffered three years Imprisonment, and afterwards
was released upon no lower terms, than a Fine of two thousand
pounds, an incapacity of any Dignity or Office in the Common<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
wealth, and to be a Prisoner at large during pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:59370:56"/>
After having been eleven years a good Justice in the <hi>Kings
bench,</hi> he died heart-broken with grief <hi>Anno</hi> 1649. <hi>Aetatis</hi> 63.</p>
            <p>Hard indeed were this Gentleman's Arguments against the
times, but soft his words, often relating, and its seems always re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>flecting
on <hi>Mnemon</hi>'s discipline, who hearing a mercenary Souldier
with many bold and impure reports exclaiming against <hi>Alexander,</hi>
lent him a blow with his Launce, saying, <hi>That he had hired him to
Fight against</hi> Alexander, <hi>and not to Rail.</hi> Only he would innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say sometimes, that he would make bold to deal with the wild
and skittish multitude, that would not indure their Riders, but
rushed like the horse to the battel, as <hi>Alexander</hi> did with his <hi>Buc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus,</hi>
take them a little by the Bridle, and turn them to the Sun
and light. Two things rendred his enemies willing, if it had been
possible, to oblige him, <hi>Cum talis sit, utinam noster esset,</hi> and when that
would not be, resolved to ruin him. [For it was a Maxime then, a
godly and good Malignant, was the most dangerous Malignant. I
remember the <hi>Waldenses</hi> are set for the greatest enemies to <hi>Rome,</hi>
upon three accounts. 1. Because they were ancient. 2. Because
they were Scripture-skilled. 3. Because they were very godly.]
1. His Religion practised to as great a height by him, as it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by them. 2. His Charity (his Hands being every day his
Executors, and his Eyes his Overseers) that relieved poor people
as fast, as the Conspiracy made them so: his goodness finding as
many ways to exercise his charity, as the men [who destroyed Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals,
and made men poor] had to make objects of it, they not
undoing men as fast as he succoured them; especially, with his
counsel to poor Loyalty, which carried Fee enough in its very
looks to him, who thought it honour enough to be Advocate to
the King of Heaven, as he had been to his dread Soveraign, and
so bound <hi>ex officio</hi> to be of Counsel. Whence (besides the common
blessing of good Lawyers, <hi>That they seldome dye without an Heir, or
making a Will</hi>) there accrewed, I cannot tell whether more comfort
to himself, more honour to his afflicted cause, or more shame to his
malicious adversaries; who to use <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi>'s words when
they persecuted him, persecuted virtue it self, which with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confined
Soul making the man, he might be Imprisoned, but not
Restrained; or if Restrained, Cloistered rather than Imprisoned;
as an holy Anchorite, rather than an Offendor, retiring from a sad
world, and not forced from it; where when alone, never less
alone, not the suffering, but the cause making the punishment, as
well as the Martyr; he thought his body always a streighter pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to his soul, than any prison could be to his body. In fine, he
commended his prison for the same reason that Sir <hi>Iohn Fortescue</hi>
commended the Inns of Court, <hi>Quod confluentium turba [studentis,
meditantis] quietem perturbare non possit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will cloath his free thoughts in the closest restraint, with
the generous Expressions of a worthy Personage that suffered
deeply in those times, and injoys only the conscience of having so
suffered in these.</p>

               <head>OF THE
LOYAL FAMILY
OF THE
BERKLEYS.
JOHN Lord BERKLEY.</head>
               <p>IT is reported of the <hi>Roman Fabii,</hi> no less numerous than vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
[three hundred and sixty <hi>Patricians</hi> flourishing of them at
once] that they were all engaged in one Battel, one onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
who being under age to bear arms, was absent.</p>
               <p>It is recorded of the Family of the <hi>Hayes</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> (in <hi>Edward</hi>
the First's time) that they were all in the Battel at <hi>Duplin</hi>-Castle,
except a Child then in his Mothers womb. Let it pass to Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the whole Family of the <hi>Berkleys</hi> were sooner or later in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
with his Sacred Majesty in the miseries of the late times;
and therefore with reason do many of them partake in the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of these.</p>
               <p>For, besides the foresaid Judge, there were several other Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Persons of this Name, who descended from Kings [for their
first Ancestor was Son to <hi>Harding</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> whence <hi>Fitz-Harding</hi>
the ancient Sir-name of all the Family formerly, and the
Title of Honour to a Noble Branch of it now:] and therefore
were resolved to hazard all in the Cause of the best King. In the
List of whose faithful followers, as few of more ancient Nobility,
<hi>Robert Harding</hi> their Ancestor, being made Baron <hi>Berkley</hi> by King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Second, so few of more untainted Loyalty; As, 1. Sir
<hi>Iohn Berkley,</hi> since Lord <hi>Berkley,</hi> much he did by his Interest in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset-shire</hi>
and <hi>Devon-shire,</hi> more in Person, most by his Care and
Discipline; two things he had a special care of, <hi>Pay</hi> and <hi>Law;</hi> his
word was, <hi>Pay them well, and hang them well.</hi> All he had himself
was bestowed on the quarrel, he judging it madness to keep an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
with the hazard of that Cause; which if miscarrying, all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried
with it; if succeeding, all was wrapped up in it. In all
meetings about the King's Affairs where he met with scruples, he
pressed the doing, and not the disputing of the King's Commands;
because otherwise Kings before they leavie an Army of Souldiers,
they must leavie an Army of Casuists and Confessors, to satisfie
each scrupulous Souldier in the perplexed and complicated
grounds of War, and that to little purpose too; the men of scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
being generally the most cowardly withal. This Gentleman
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59370:58"/>
having an excellent rule, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Commands of Majesty, if
not immediately (without any tedious inferences) contrary to the
Law of God and Nature, were not to be disputed: A Rule that
quickly satisfied all honest men, and as quickly silenced those that
were otherwise inclined.</p>
               <p>He behaved himself in the West, 1. Keeping the Countrey from
Free-quarter. 2. Stopping the Inroads of the Parliaments Forces
thither. 3. Keeping open their Trade. 4. Keeping a good cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
among their Gentry, that <hi>Septemb.</hi> 4. 1643. when <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
was delivered up to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> he was made Governour of
it; keeping it, and the Countrey round about it, in a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
degree of quietness and subjection, and easily advancing
for three years 50000<hi>l.</hi> a year for the King's Service; until it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God in wrath to the King's enemies to ruine the King's Cause,
and leave them who had been happy if reduced to a subjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, to be undone among themselves; and <hi>Fairfax</hi> having
defeated almost all the King's Army in the field, <hi>Ian.</hi> 25. 1645. made
his way as far as <hi>Porthrane,</hi> a Fort within three miles of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
whence <hi>Iun.</hi> 17. he summoneth Sir <hi>Iohn Berkley,</hi> with Conditions
to himself, his Officers, Citizens, and Souldiers, who having
maintained the Garrison so long and so well, that it was looked on
as the safest place for the Queen to lye in with the most Illustrious
Princess <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> now Dutchess of <hi>Orleans,</hi> as the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablest
place for that Princess to continue in during the War, as
she did with the Honourable the Lady <hi>Dalkeith:</hi> And, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
refuge for distressed Cavaliers in <hi>England,</hi> returns this generous
Answer; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That his Trust was delivered to him from His
Majesty, which he would discharge to his power; That they
have no reason to distrust a blessing from God in delivering that
Garison, who is able to deliver them, and may be so pleased
without a miracle; the Prince having so considerable a Force at
so near a distance to them; That if all actions of their lives, were
as innocent as their hands, of the blood that hath, or shall be
spilt in defence of their Righteous Cause, they shall in all events
rest in perfect peace of mind, and will not despair.</q> At which
brave Reply, the General being rather pleased than provoked,
makes not an angry, but a civil and ingenious (though ineffectual)
Retortion, and having raised two Bridges over the River <hi>Ex,</hi>
blocked up the City on all sides, and drawn up within Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot
of it, leaves the Siege to Sir <hi>Hardress Waller,</hi> going in person
against the Prince to the West, till the third of <hi>April,</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
distressed beyond all relief, they agreed that Commissioners
should treat, as they did ten days (a long time to the impatient
Souldiers, who complained that they had to do with long-tongued
Lawyers) concluding upon the most honourable Tearms (<hi>Fairfax</hi>
and <hi>Cromwel</hi> upon some particular policy of their own, never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
any other;) <q>That the Princess <hi>Henrietta</hi> should depart any
whither in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> until His Majesty should give order
for her disposal. 2. Neither the Cathedral nor Churches to be
defaced. 3. That the Garison should march out according to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59370:59"/>
the most honourable custome of War, and to have free-quarter
all the way; and not be compelled to march above ten miles a
day, and with their Arms to the places agreed on. The compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of persons of quality should not exceed two years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase.
That all persons comprised within these Articles, should
quietly and peacerbly enjoy all their Goods, debts, and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables,
during the space of four moneths next ensuing; and be
free from all covenants, oaths, and protestations, and have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
within the said four moneths, in case they shall not make
their compositions with the Parliament, and shall be resolved to
go beyond Sea (for which they shall have passes) to dispose their
said Goods, debts, and moveables allowed by these Articles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Articles and a Surrendry so honourable, that they were the Rule
and Copie of all the following good Articles which the Army
made; but their masters kept not perhaps their design in granting
so good Conditions in all places surrendred to them, was to raise
themselves a reputation able to give Law to the Parliament, that
should lose its self in breaking of them.</p>
               <p>I must not forget three things remarkable concerning this Siege,
1. A strange providence of God: <hi rend="margQuotes">For when this place was so close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
besieged, that onely the South-side thereof towards the Sea
was open unto it, incredible number of Laches were found in
that open quarter; for multitude [saith an eye and a mouth-witness]
like the Quails in the Wilderness [though blessed be
God] unlike them both in cause and effect, as not desired with
man's destruction, nor sent with God's anger, as appeared by
their safe digestion into wholsome nourishment: they were as
fat as plentiful, so that being sold for two-pence a dozen and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
[the poor who could have no cheaper, as the rich no better
meat] used to make pottage of them, boyling them down there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Several Natural causes were assigned hereof, 1. That these
Fowl frighted with much shooting on the Land, retreated to the
Sea-side for their refuge. 2. That it is familiar with them in cold
Winters [such as that was] to shelter themselves in the most
Southern coasts. 3. That some sort of seed was lately sown in
those parts, which invited them thither for their own repasts;
however, saith our Author, the cause of causes was Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
thereby providing a feast for many poor people, who
otherwise had been pinched for provision.</hi> 2. The faithfulness
of the place, eminent now for a pair-Royal of extraordinary ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to the Crown

Their Spirit and Conduct being admirable in the two first, and
their Allegiance unstained in the last. 3. The peculiar Gift of
the Governour, 1. In Watchfulness, both in looking to his own
charge, and in taking advantages of his enemies. 2. In an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
address, going as far sometimes with fair language and good
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59370:59"/>
words, as others did with money. 3. In encouraging the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
labours with his own, managing his command over them the
better, by making himself equal with them. <hi rend="margQuotes">When the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
at the Spanish Fleet's approach in 88, drew their Ships out
of <hi>Plymouth</hi> Haven, <hi>Cambden</hi> attributes their success to the Lord
Admiral <hi>Howard</hi>'s towing a Cable in his own person, the least
joynt of whose exemplary hand drew more than twenty men
besides.</hi> 4. By observing as well as commanding them, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
preferring them, as well as observing them, neither disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
nor exasperating true Valour. 5. By sharing with his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in their wants as well as in their other hardships, indigency
is an honour, when it's the chief Commanders condition: Two
words to his Souldiers did a brave Prince good service once in a
streight, <hi>I am your fellow-commoner, and your fellow-labourer.</hi> 6. By
understanding well the defects and failings of the Garison, as well
as its accommodation.</p>
               <p>It's a very remarkable passage, that (when my Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>
made three approaches upon three great, though not commonly
observed, disadvantages of the Garison) he charmed the Council
of War to an opinion of a noble surrender with this Story: <q>A
man with an Ulcer on his face, passed over a Bridge, where the
passengers were to pay a certain piece of money for every mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of body found about them, and was required to pay the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
Tribute for the Ulcer in his face: But he refusing to
pay it, the Officer pull's off his hat, intending to keep it for a
pawn; his hat being taken off, another malady appears in his
bald head: Now Sir (said the Officer) I must have a double
Tribute of you: Nay, saith the Traveller, that ye shall not,
and begins to struggle with the Officer; who being too strong
for him, gave him a foil, by means whereof there was a Rupture
perceived under his coat. The more we strive with these people,
the more we discover our infirmities.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Trust he managed so well, that the Queens Majesty inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
earnestly for his preferment in these very expressions in a
Letter dated <hi>March</hi> 13. 1644. <hi>Farewel my Dear Heart: Behold the
mark which you desire to have to know when I desire any thing in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest*.
I pray begin to remember what I spake to you concerning</hi> Jache
Berkley <hi>for Master of the Wards.</hi> And the King in his confinement
was very earnest for his company, making use of him in all his
transactions with the Parliament and Army, especially in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
escape from <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where the Army observing how the
King was caressed from all parts of the Kingdom, buzzed up and
down a jealousie among the Kings followers, that he should be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saslinated,
that he might flie out of the place where he was most
secure (being near his friends, the City and Parliament, then well
inclined towards him) to a place where he was most in danger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
far off; the Faction having fore-cast, that the King in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
of his affairs would cast himself, when in danger of his life,
upon Col. <hi>Hammond</hi> [for his relation to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> his Majesties
beloved Chaplain] for that very purpose not long before made
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59370:60"/>
Governour of the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> as he did in the company of Sir
<hi>Iohn Berkley,</hi> Col. <hi>Io. Ashburnam,</hi> and Col. <hi>Will. Legg,</hi> who smelt the
Plot by the slightness of the Guards, that dark and tempestuous
Night, and a whispering that there was of the King's going to the
<hi>Isle of Wight</hi> in the Army a Fort-night before, and therefore Sir
<hi>Iohn</hi> was for going to <hi>Iersey;</hi> especially when he considered, that
most of the Advices given the King to escape, proceeded from
<hi>Whaley,</hi> and those of the Army, especially the Letter of Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
(which he would take upon his Oath was feigned) mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Sir <hi>W. S.</hi> p. 1018. if any where; the Advise being to have
staid there, and cast no fears, jealousies or new disputes, which the
Army aimed at, among an already distracted people. But as God
would have it, that his Majesty should not escape those greatest
tryals, and most glorious acts of patience he had designed him;
for <hi>Hammond,</hi> to whom they went with the hazard of their lives,
could be wrought to nothing, but some formal civilities, and yet
they being so far gone into the Net, must be trusted to, though
with the King's extraordinary Regret: Sir <hi>Iohn Berkley</hi> offering
then a desperate attempt for the King's escape at last cast, though
the King refused it, saying, <hi>That he would always humble himself to
Gods good pleasure.</hi> Nay, which was more, Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> would have
been taken to let the King escape. Therefore the Parliament so
strictly enquired after him, although his own friends censured
him, so interpreting this action by the success, not considering the
numerous difficulties in forming any resolution, nor the fallacious
representation of affairs to him (by those that contrived this
whole Plot, to take the Parliament off from the King by his
disturst of them, and confidence in the Army) but only looked on
his improsperous services, according to the fate of unhappy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
which is, <hi>To have that Condemned, which is put in Execution; and
that Practised as best, which was never Tried.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The King was no sooner in the <hi>Isle of Wight,</hi> than the Faction
let loose their fury upon the Gentlemen that attended him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<hi>Hammond</hi> to send them up to <hi>London</hi> to be proceeded
against; which he refused, pretending, First, The just offence
thereby given the King in removing his only Friends and Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars,
then his honour engaged, as he said, for their Indemnity:
<q>The King himself likewise Interposing, that if those Gentlemen
were taken away, and punished as evil doers, for counselling
him not not to go out of the kingdom, but rather to come to the
place where he now is, for the ends aforesaid, and for their indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
accordingly to attend him thither, he cannot but expect to
be dealt with accordingly, his case being the same.</q> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> escap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the danger of this fatal piece of service, addressed himself to
more, in the way of Intelligence and Correspondence between
the King and the West, between the West and the North, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
all these Parts and <hi>France</hi> (where the Queen kept up the
King her husband's Reputation, and promoted his Interest) until
being forced from the King, he and Colonel <hi>Walter Slingsby,</hi> were
secured <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. at Colonel <hi>Trevanions</hi> house in <hi>Cornewall,</hi> and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59370:60"/>
underwent all the sad effects of the Tyrannies acted here for
twelve years together, without any other comfort, than some op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of serving his Sacred Majesty with better Intention
than Success, using means, and leaving events to God; being resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to win the <hi>Roman</hi> Consul's Elogy, who was commended for not
despairing of the Commonwealth; his spirit being above his own
Fortune, and his Enemies too; who indeed had put an end to the
War, yet could not find the way to Peace; their souls being unequal
to their victory, and not able to temper their success, but turning
those arts and arms wherewith they had prevailed against their
Soveraign [so true is that of <hi>Seneca, Scelera dissident</hi>] against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
until they ruined themselves, as well as his Majesty, and made
way for that settlement which they had overthrown, wherein this
Noble Person had as large a share of his Majesties favours in <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> when restored, as he had of his afflictions, when banish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as had his elder Brother Sir <hi>Charles Berkley,</hi>
Lord <hi>Fitz-harding,</hi>
not short of him in Integrity and Loyalty, though not so much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in Action. They say, that though busling times are best for
the Writer, yet quiet times are best for the Liver; so though stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
men afford more matter of discourse to Authors, yet calm spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and peaceable men yield most matter of peace and satisfaction
to themselves; the deep waters are still too: lighter passions have a
loud voice, but the greatest are usually silent, and actions of a
lesser dimension have a great mention, while noble and great acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
exceeding Historians expressions, exercise their modesty. The
inward Wheels that set the Engine on work, are less observed,
though of more consequence, than those parts that move most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
               <p>He that made Interests, kept Correspondence, engaged Parties,
sent and procured Supplies, disposed of Commissions, managed the
Designs for the Restauration of his Majesty, though the most secret,
yet was the most effectual Instrument of the great mercy vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to this Nation. Such as this honourable person was, who
(when more than 50000 <hi>English-men</hi> were corrupted by the arts
and success of the Faction, and their own covetousness, weakness,
and ambition to a partnership in their guilt) in the middest of the
cruelties and victories of the Conspiracy, that amazed most part
of Mankind, taught the unskillful the method of Confederacy
and Design, and in spight of the vigilant, because fearful Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides,
opened opportunities, both of Correspondence with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
and with all true-hearted <hi>English-men,</hi> who communicated
Counsels, gave mutual Incouragements, raised Supplies, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Flames that might have devoured the Juncto, had it not pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God, that he and Sir <hi>Henry Slingsby</hi> should be taken, and so
forced to exchange his Services for Sufferings, from Prison to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questration,
from Sequestration to Prison, from thence to Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
For as in the Primitive times, when any Calamity hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
the Heathens cried, <hi>Christiani ad Leones;</hi> so when the least
toy took the Christians frighted out of their sences, in the
head, they cried, <hi>Secure the Cavaliers, Secure the Cavaliers,</hi> and that

so long, until (as the sufferings of the Martyrs converted the
world, so the generously born afflictions of Loyalty reduced the
kingdom) it became necessary for them to secure the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who as one man, as acted by one common <hi>Genius,</hi> like the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the world, wrought its way into that settlement by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
consent, which could not be attained to by any particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination;
in which settlement, this excellent Person not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
a freedom from his pressures, but a reward for them, being
made upon the King's Return Comptroller of the Houshold, one of
his Majesties most Honourable Privy Council, Treasurer of the
Houshold, Governor of in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of great trust about his
Highness the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> in which capacities he looks not to
what he might do, but what he should, measuring his actions by
justice and expedience: If any person would know more of him,
let him make his Address to him, and he shall find him Courteous;
let him Petition him, and he shall find him extraordinarily Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table;
let him go to his Table, and he shall find him Hospitable;
let him Converse with him, and he shall find him Exact and Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual:
In a word, a perfect Country Gentleman at Court, one
whose very nature is in pay and service to his Majesty, gaining him
by his Civilities more Hearts, than either Laws or Armies can gain
Subjects. Every time my Lord <hi>Fitz-harding</hi> smiles, the King of
<hi>England</hi> gains one. The <hi>Roman</hi> Lady, when asked where her Jewels

THE EARL
OF
FALMOUTH.</head>
               <p>AS Treason taints the bloud, so Loyalty ennobleth it; the
one deriving honour as effectually, as the other doth guilt.
This personage inherited his Fathers Services as well as his
Spirit, being an early confessor of Allegiance, and taught to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with Majesty, as soon as to live; he had the advantage of most
other Gentlemen, that he begun, and spent some years of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the experience of troubles, and exercise of patience, <hi rend="margQuotes">where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all virtues moral and political, are commonly better plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a thriving, as Trees set in Winter, than in the warmth, and
serenity of times, or amidst those delights which usually attend
Princes Courts, in the midst of peace and plenty; which are
prone either to root up all plants of true virtue and honor, or
to be contented only with some leaves and withering formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of them, without any real fruits, such as tend to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
good; for which Gentlemen should always remember they
are born, and by providence designed.</hi> Besides the intimacy of
converse between his Sacred Majesty (the most condescending
Prince in the world) and him in their tender years, for which King
<hi>Edward</hi> 6. loved <hi>Fitz-patriche</hi> so well, as to have some thoughts of
marrying him to his Sister, and advancing him to the kingdom;
besides the sympathy of their spirits, visible in the exact symmetry
of their persons, which indeared <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi>
so much to <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. that he was the only person that lived and dyed
in the full Favour of that Prince: Of whom it is observed, <q>That
they who were highest in his Favour, had their Heads nearest
danger.</q> There were these remarkable things that recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this young Gentleman to his Majesties Favour.</p>
               <p>1. His Happiness of Address, much advantaged by the Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of his Person, the Smoothness of his Voice, the Sweetness of
his Temper, and the Neatness of his Fancy. True is that obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of a great States-man, if a man mark it well, it is in
praise and commendation of men, as it is in gettings and gains:
For the Proverb is true, <q>That light gains, makes heavy purses;
for light gains come thick, whereas great come now and then:
So it is true, that small matters win great commendation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59370:62"/>
they are continually in use and in note; whereas the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of any great virtue cometh but on Festivals; therefore
it doth much adde to a mans Reputation, and is [as Queen <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
said] like perpetual Letters Commendatory to have good
<hi>forms.</hi>
                  </q> And therefore, besides several other Messages of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
he had the Management of a Complement of very great
consequence to the <hi>French</hi> King; for his Conduct in which, he was
not only nobly presented by that Prince, but highly valued by his
own Soveraign.</p>
               <p>2. His Integrity and Faithfulness in performing Trusts and
keeping Secrets, whereof several instances of Importance in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
France</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> qualities that capacitated him not only
for the service, but the friendship of his Master; who with the
wisest Princes in the world, considering the natural distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and their Subjects, deny them the common comforts
of intimate friends and familiars, raise some tried persons to the
intimacy of companions (under the name with us of Favourites,
among the <hi>Romans</hi> of <hi>Participes Curarum</hi>) in whose Breasts they may
lay their Heads, &amp; in whose Bosoms they may ease their griefs, joys,
fears, hopes, suspicions, counsels, and whatsoever lieth upon them,
and would otherwise eat the Heart, to oppress it in a civil kind of
shrift or confession. Friendship calming the Affections from storm
and tempest, and clearing the Understanding out of darkness and
confusion of thoughts; for whosoever hath his Mind fraught with
many thoughts, his Wits and Understanding do clarifie and break
up in the communicating and discoursing with another, though he
be not able to discourse again; so much is gained by tossing the
thoughts more easily, by marshalling them more orderly, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how they look when they are cloathed with words, that whets,
that cuts not. It's my Lord <hi>Bacons</hi> opinion, <q>That a man had
better relate himself to a Statue or Picture, than to suffer his
thoughts to perplex himself.</q>
               </p>
               <p>3. Activity and Dispatch. The <hi>Spartans</hi> loved four sorts of
States-men. 1. They that performed business reservedly, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
noise. 2. Effectually, avoiding after-claps. 3. Sweetly and
oblgingly, raising no discontents. And 4. Quickly, affecting not
delays.</p>
               <p>4. And all this wrapped in a good Nature, that made it its busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to oblige others to his Master, as much as he was obliged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Some Druggs are very wholesome, but very bitter; good
in the Operation, but unkind in the Palate: And some persons are
very useful in their services, but so morose in their expressions of
them, that Masters are afraid of their duties. This honourable
person was as affable to others, as he found his Master was to him;
his performances being not like Pills that must be wrapped in
something else before they could be swallowed, but the candor
and sereness of his disposition made his employment as amiable as
it was serviceable. He [all sweetness, all Balsom, healing and
helping] translated into <hi>English</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Character, <hi>Neminem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
demisit tristem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:59370:62"/>
But neither did he esteem these happy qualities of his Person,
nor the former instances of his Service, any way answering the
great favours of his Soveraign, without some new attempt, as
much beyond common performances, as his obligations were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
common kindnesses. It was not enough to discharge his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Trusts faithfully, to wear his Honour and his Grandieur be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commingly,
Manage Affairs usefully, to accommoda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e all Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
prudently; these are too common returns of favour.</p>
               <p>When the same Royal person was to adventure himself to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
our happiness, who was himself a great part of it, when his
Highness the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was resolved to hazzard that dear life
for his Brother and his Country, that he had ventured for other
Princes and meer Honour, when all the hopes and concernments
of the Nation were wrapped up in the Admiral, and the Engage<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment,
neither the intreaties of his Friends, nor the tears of his
Spouse, beseeching him by the Pledges of his Love, one in her
Armes, the other in her Womb, could diswade him (though in
no command, save as he said, the Commissions of Allegiance and
Gratitude) from attending that brave Prince in his dangers, that
he had waited on in affliction; to whose quarrel every true <hi>English-man</hi>
owed a life, it being the three Nations Engagement, and to
whose family he owed Estate, Honour, and every thing he had to
loose but a life, they being the effects of Royal bounty, when he
knew he had the prayers of three Nations along with him while
he lived with his Highness, and their sorrows if he should have
dyed with him. Whom he had the honor to divertise with his In<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>genuity,
to assist with his Counsel, and as it were to redeem, with
his Death, (Those several Noblemen with his Highness, being like
the several king like persons, about <hi>Richard</hi> III. to amuse fate, and
receive those dreadful Shots aimed at him in their own persons.) A
death he would have undergone ten times over to save that life
that was worth three kingdoms, which since the Heroick Duke
would not save alone by withdrawing, he should not loose alone
in Fight: but as the kindest Wifes in <hi>Aethiopia</hi> will needs be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with their Husbands alive; so his dearest friends would
needs perish with him; congratulating their new honours for this
reason, that they might [like the Sacrifice that is first crowned
and then offered] fall more Nobly and becoming a Princes com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panions
and their bloud, though it might <hi>dash,</hi> might not <hi>stain</hi>
their Royal Master.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iune</hi> the 2. 1665 (coming to wait on the Duke, with his Soveraigns
love in the one hand, and his own life in the other, but a little before
the Fight] he fell with two honourable persons, one on the one
hand, and another on the other, so near the Duke that his Brains
dashed on his Cloaths: The brave Prince no doubt reflecting on
his friend, as Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> did on his, when he said, <hi>Ah Dear—
I could grieve for thee, but is is no time to let down my spirits.</hi> And
(the proper bemoaning of a friends death in War, being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
it) resolving to appease his Ghost with <hi>Opdams</hi> bloud, who
attended him immediately to the other world, with all those ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59370:63"/>
about him, that shall destroy this to have Victory bleeding by
him; a Prince in the same danger with him, a Soveraign bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, none envying, all pittying, is a happy way of dying, that
all men may wish, few men obtain: When <hi>Sejanus</hi> lived so much
in the Emperours favour, as that they two were reckoned and
termed friends (the Emperour writing to <hi>Sejanus</hi> thus in a Letter
<hi>Haec pro amicitia non occultavi</hi>) the whole Senate dedicated an Altar
to the Goddess Friendship. When a person shall be so <hi>happy,</hi> as to
injoy his Princes favour; so <hi>grateful,</hi> as to be ambitious of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to deserve it; so <hi>innocent,</hi> as not to wrong the meanest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
by it [being great only, that he might be able to be <hi>good</hi>] yet
so unhappy, as to dye the very beginning of it.</p>
               <p>It is very fit we should Erect a Tomb to Friendship, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,

               <p>Sir <hi>Edward Berkley</hi> that honest Gentleman, that was neither Sued,
nor did Sue in his life, so willing he was to live in private peace, and
thence it is easily guessed how unwilling he was to engage in
publick quarrels, until he saw there was no hope of any tollerable
Peace, but from the success of a just War.</p>
               <p>A Farmer rented a Grange, generally reported to be haunted
by Fairies; and paid a shrewd Rent for the same at each half years
end. Now a Gentleman asked him how he durst be so hardy as to
live in the house, and whether no spirits troubled him. Truth
(said the Farmer) there be two Saints in Heaven vex me worse
than all the Devils in Hell, namely, the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and <hi>Michael</hi>
the <hi>Arch-angel,</hi> on which days he paid his <hi>Rent.</hi> This was none of
Sir <hi>Edwards</hi> Tenants, who were so kindly treated, that he would
not receive his Rents, until he had seen what his Tenants had got;
and when he took them, he would chuse rather to take them in

had to sell, then in monies; which he knewthey could not spare,
and he did not want.</p>
               <p>Now those poor people that he used so tenderly himself, he was
loath should be oppressed by others, and that the estates they had
got under him, should be a Prey to those who aimed at a Tyranny
over the Nation, from which he knew no way to secure them but to
stand by his Prince, in whose just authority was lodged the estates
and liberties of all his Subjects; and there was not a more effectual
way to secure poor people in their enjoyments, than to support that
Soveraignty that had the care of all their interests, and would not
permit others to wrong them, as he could keep them from usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon him.</p>
               <p>He did not fight (indeed it could not be expected from his years,
of which he would say, <hi>That though he could not lift up a hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Rebels in the Field, yet he would lift up both for his Majesty
in his Closet.</hi> He would assault Heaven, and besiege the Throne of
Grace) but he Contributed; he handled not Steel, but he laid out
Silver and Gold; and what was more, gave Intelligence. It was
<hi>Scipio Affricanus</hi> his great honor, he condescended to serve under his
younger Brother: it was this Gentlemans remarkable character that
what he could not do himself, he assisted his meaner Relations to

do as long as he lived, and bequeathed to them his Loyalty and
Estate when he died 165 ... <hi>Aetatis</hi> 64.</p>

he would say, never reconciled to his Wife, because never at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
with her; a good Father, intending the education more than
the pleasing of his Children, by the same token, that he was very
careful what School-masters settled near him; the Jews not more
mischievously poisoning Springs in <hi>England,</hi> formerly, as they were
charged, than School-masters mis-principling Youth, the Well-head
of a Nations hope, as they were complained of. A good Church-man
abhorring the laziness of those, that as <hi>Cicero</hi> said, never
see the Sun either rising or setting; and the Indevotion of those
that come neither at the beginning of Prayer, nor have the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

commenceth it, and the Blessing that concludes it. A good friend,

               <p>
                  <hi>PHilip de Commines</hi> telleth us of a Noble Family in <hi>Flandert,</hi>
that generally they lost their lives in the Service of their
Prince: And we find in our own Chronicles, that <hi>Edmund</hi>
Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> lost his life in the first battel of Saint <hi>Albans,</hi>
Duke <hi>Henry</hi> following him, taken in the battel of <hi>Hexan,</hi> and so
beheaded: a second Duke <hi>Edmund,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Somerset,</hi>
going the same way in the battel of <hi>Teuxbury,</hi> all of them fighing
in the behalf of King <hi>Henry,</hi> and the House of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> but then
they heaped not Funeral upon Funeral, in so short a time as this
honorable Family did; in which respect, as those of the House of
<hi>Somerset</hi> exceeded the House of <hi>Flanders,</hi> so the House of the
<hi>Berkleys</hi> exceeded the House of <hi>Somerset;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Falmouth,</hi>
the elder Brother, Keeper of his Majesties Privy Purse, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of his Highness Regiment of Gaurds, fell the first year of our

                  </gap>idings, that as waves following waves
had swallowed up that good Family; parallel to that which the
Historian calleth the Mourning Family in <hi>Italy,</hi> did not the same
consideration buoy up them that supported the other, that these
hopeful Personages died in that service for which they were born
[<hi>Patriae geniti, &amp; toti nati mundo</hi>] the honor of their Soveraign, and
the good of their Country. Nature that made one industry was
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59370:64"/>
to make all these Brothers Heirs: One of the younger Brothers
gives, as the Heralds observe, a <hi>Martlet</hi> for the difference of his
Armes; a Bird observed to build either in Castles, Steeples, or
Ships, shewing, saith our Author, that the Bearer thereof, being to
cut out his own fortune, must seek by War, Learning, or Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
to advance his estate.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman being Bound to a Merchant [trade hath raised
many families, and restored more, and Apprentiship doth neither
extinguish native Gentility, nor disinable to acquisitive) is presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to have behaved himself as a good Servant, because that was
the way to be a happy Master; for we learn to command by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to know what we should exact from others, by what we
have performed our selves; besides, a great Fortune, like great
Buildings, must have low and humble Foundations.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Dutch</hi> Encroachments allowed our Merchants no
more Trade than they tought for, Master <hi>Berkley,</hi> as willingly served
the King to vindicate and recover Trade, as he had done his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
to understand it. What was extravagancy in the young Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
becomes courage and resolution in the Sea-men and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
war and publick affairs exercising that spirit that was too
big for soft peace, and private business. He was content to go first
a Volunteer, to observe the Conduct and Discipline of others;
and after evident trials of his personal valour, to set out as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
to exercise his own; though yet not taking notice so much,
that he was advanced by his Princes favour to be a Captain over
his men, as that he was in his Service a Fellow-souldier with them.
The Conqueror, when he first Landed his Forces in this Nation,
burnt all his Ships, that despair to return might make his men the
more valiant. <hi rend="margQuotes">Younger Brothers (they are the words of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Author) being cut off at home from all hopes, are more
zealous to purchase an honorable support abroad; their small
arteries with great spirits have wrought miracles, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
hath driven success before it.</hi> When the Orator was
asked, What was that that made an Orator successful? He answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Action. What next? Action. What next again? Action.
Wonderful like (saith the Lord <hi>Verulam</hi>) is the case of boldness in
Sea-affairs: What first? Boldness. What second and third? Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Though he never tempted dangers, yet he never avoided
them, witness the <hi>Streights</hi> Expedition, wherein, though expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
commonly out-doeth ordinary performances, yet he out-did
expectation its self; resolving not to <hi>Yeild,</hi> even when it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to <hi>Overcome;</hi> and when Stiffled rather than Mastered, he
might have had Quarter with more honor, than his enemies could
give it; yet <hi>Antaeus</hi> like, taking courage from his misfortunes, his
courage whetted with anger and revenge, not only fills up the
great breach made in the Ship, by the loss of an excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
but managed it too with such a present courage, as not
only out-faced danger, but even commanded and disciplined it
too, scattering a new vigor upon his new Command, here then on
this, on that side his examples; quickning his authority so, that his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59370:65"/>
very Conqueror became his Prize, when he had men enough left
to master the Ship, and yet not enough without some more assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to Man it, winning on the enemy, even when he seemed to
have lost himself.</p>
               <p>Great was the value others put on the Prizes now, and at other
times taken by him; greater the esteem he had of the actions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which at Court deserved a Knight-hood, an Honor (that by
an over-value of themselves make some fearful of those services
that gained them that value) yet raised rather than abated his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution;
as well remembring the custome which is used at the
Creation of some Knights, wherein the Kings Master-Cook com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth, and presents his great Knife to the new made Knights,
admonishing them to be faithful and valiant, otherwise he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
them, that that very Knife is prepared to cut off their Spurs.
And in the Fleet gained a Vice-Admirals Command, a power the
greater it was, the more careful he was not to abuse it, managing his
authority at Sea, as if [what Sea-Captains seldom do] he should give
an account of it at Land. None so wary in Council, none so bold
in Execution. Valour in acting doth well in him that is under the
direction of others, prudence in advising becomes him who is to
guide; the ones excellency lying in not seeing dangers, the others
in seeing them. His goodness sweetned his greatness, and the
best mettal and blade is that which bends; and his industry and
patience set off his goodness, pains having knit the joynts of his
Soul, and made them more solid and compacted, and his piety both
of them, seeing so much of God in the deep, he saw the proper
reason of that common Proverb, <hi>He that cannot pray, let him go to
Sea.</hi> And understanding himself so well, that he was none of
those Sea-men, who [as if their hearts were made of those Rocks
they Sail by] are so always in death, that they never think of it.</p>
               <p>Most young men, when advanced, are transported with the
Footboys fancy in <hi>Huartus,</hi> that thought himself a Monarch, and
the Doctor in <hi>Acosta</hi> that apprehended himself King and Pope:
so apt is heighth to turn the brain. This Gentleman was of the
Nobleman in <hi>Laurentius</hi> his temper, that though otherwise very
sensible, yet was perswaded that he was <hi>Glass:</hi> so much affected
was he with the consideration of his frailty and mortality. In all
his great actions, you might spye in his looks that he had a Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
like the Emperors Boy following him with a <hi>Memento te esse
mortalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this capacity he rides in the Fleet under the command of
Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Albemarle;</hi> when <hi>Iune</hi> 2. 1665. the
Engagement between the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> began, wherein his
place was ordered towards the Rear, though his spirit made to the
Front, had Discipline endured it; in reference to which, he thought
it greater service to submit to the command of Superiours, than
to be forward in the Engagement with his Enemies; <hi rend="margQuotes">lest other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he might be served as the French Souldier was in <hi>Scotland</hi>
about a hundred year ago, who first mounted the Bulwark of a
Fort besieged, whereupon ensued the gaining of the Fort: But
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59370:65"/>
Marshal <hi>de Thermes</hi> the French General first Knighted him, and
then hanged him within an hour after, because he had done it
without command.</hi> The evil example out-weighed the good
service. The posture was so unhappy, that he, as well as Sir <hi>George
Ascue</hi> his Admiral, were parted from the Fleet first, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
from one another. [<hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> asunder, betokened
ill luck to the Sea-men,] and misfortunes following each other as
waves do; Sir <hi>William</hi> was divided from himself, some of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
not thinking fit to obey what he thought fit to command, and
their performances were like to succeed, when neither would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and both could not handsomely go abreast. In this condition
he resolved his Valour should make amends for his misfortune,
and though he was <hi>unhappy,</hi> he would not be <hi>unworthy</hi> too, he had
rather die <hi>ten times</hi> than <hi>once</hi> survive his Credit. The sweetness of
<hi>life</hi> being not able to make him swallow down the bitterness of
<hi>disgrace:</hi> He attempted a probability of success, with a certainty of
his own danger, not without reason, when the ignominy of a
quarter from the Enemy he had to deal with, was more intolerable
than the pains of a death; of which a Sea-man thinks, that as it
is far hotter under the Tropick in the coming to the Line, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Line it self: so the fear and fancy in preparing for death,
is more terrible than death it self. <hi>Berkley</hi> against the whole Fleet
himself a Navie, yet carrying nothing about him impenetrable
but his mind. About six a clock he was shot in at his throat with a
Musket-bullet, and out at his back; whereof indeed he fell, but
would not die, until the Enemy over-powering his men (each of
whom inspired by his example now, as by his command before,
was a <hi>Berkley:</hi> [the Sun setting, each little star appears] and had,
like him, the art of incountring, but not of escaping) took the
Ship, not till two hours after his fall; when his brave Soul scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be a prisoner to the <hi>Dutch</hi> and to his own body too, left
him just as the Enemies came and took him. He never spoke after
this unhappy shot, but his look did; which from his eye dispersed
as much valour as he did before with his hand, fresh Orders issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still from his aspect; which a man looked on, and vowed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a brave revenge, or as brave a death; either what the dying
Captain aimed at, <hi>Victory,</hi> or what he enjoyed, <hi>Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ship (the <hi>Swiftsure</hi>) with so many men and Guns, and so
good a sailer as she was of the second Rate, was a great prize to
the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> but this person a greater, though dead; the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Carcase being of so great a value (and if the Cabinet was
so rich, what was the Jewel?) that the States paid for it the old
value of a Province, and thought to demand for it the liberty of a
whole Fleet of prisoners. Great was the respect they gave him, in
their care to embalm and lay him in State in the great Church at the
<hi>Hague</hi> [proud it seems of their enemy] where as many came to see
him now dead, as feared him before; the throng now standing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his corps but tremblingly, as before they did before his person.
Greater was the Honour of their Reasons for that respect, <hi>viz.</hi> [to
use their own words] <q>For the Dignity of his Person, the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59370:66"/>
of his Command, and the Renown of his Valour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</q>
Greatest of all was the esteem they seemed to have of him,
when they thought him a present fit to oblige His Majesty of <hi>Great
Brittain</hi> (at that time when they were most to seek for some effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
way of addressing themselves to him in order to an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation)
as they sent him, <hi>Aug.</hi> 23. 1666.<note place="margin">☞</note> with Honour enough
certainly, since Sir <hi>William Berkley</hi>'s Body was the greatest Present
the High and Mighty States could send, and <hi>the onely</hi> kindness the
most Puissant and Sacred Majesty of the King of <hi>Great Brittain</hi>
would at that time accept at their hands.</p>

the Faction, being in firm hope to have taken them at last;

with considerable supplies, that he could not wait on in person,

               <p>TO all these, I could adde Sir <hi>William Berkley,</hi> whose Man was
Governor of <hi>Virginia</hi> in the late times (when Princes were
forced to go a Foot, and Servants Ride on Horse-back) and
he himself in these, when there have been made such orders for
the improvement of the Plantation, as are inferior only to the
rules given him for the first erection of it, which yet were none of
the strictest; for otherwise, as Infants must be swathed not laced,
so young Plantations will never grow, if streightned with as hard
Laws as setled Common-wealths, though they proved the most
effectual: those people giving no reason for that bitter, rather than
false jest, spoken of one of our late Western Plantations (consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
most of dissolute people, Christian Savages among the Pagan
Negroes) <hi>That it was very like unto</hi> England, <hi>as being spit out of the
very Mouth of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Gentleman aiming at two things, that may do much good,
and that is, 1. Justice in Dealings, witness the brave Edicts made
at a Convention there 1662. That their dealings among the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes
there, may be as naked as their going. 2. A Sober Religion
[that may bless the Christians there, and convert the Heathens in
one; of whom it is more to overcome Paganism, than to master
an 100 Pagans] witness the very reasonable Proposals, made both
for the supporting and propagating of Religion in that Country;
for the maintenance of their Ministers, and the discipline of their
Church, to the Right Reverend Father in God <hi>Gilbert</hi> then Lord
Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and since Lord Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who
encouraged the prudential part of their design, in a way of great
incouragement to the present generation, and of great blessing to

               <head>Sir EDWARD BERKLEY.</head>
               <p>ANd from him it were pity to part his inseparable companion
in Loyalty and Sufferings, Sir <hi>Edward Berkley,</hi> that living
confutation of <hi>Machiavell</hi> (who thought religion spoiled a
generous person, as bad as a Shower of Rain doth his Plume of
Feathers on a rainy day) being at once most pious, and most gallant,
of as much humble devotion, as generous and daring valour; as
meek towards God as he was brave towards an enemy; very well
known for the hardness of his body, and more honored for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59370:68"/>
of his mind. First he learned to follow others, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to command himself, being so much the more happy in his
providence forward, as had he gone farther in his experience back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
being as knowing himself, as he was happy in commanding
others that were so. Extreamly careful of his first enterprizes, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that a Commanders reputation once raised, will keep its self up;
like a round body, some force is required to set it up, though when
it is up, it will move its self. Three things he abhorred in his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
1. Scoffing at Religion, a sin unusual, never a civil Nation in
the world being guilty of it. 2. Useless: for either the scoffer
believes what he scoffs at, and so he puts a great affront upon his
conscience, or he doth not, and then its in vain to cry down that
Religion with raillery, that is supported so much by demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And 3. Debauchery: being of <hi>Gustavus Adolphus,</hi> that true
Souldier, as well as great Kings, temper, <hi rend="margQuotes">Who when he first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<hi>Germany,</hi> and perceived how many women followed his
Camp, some being Wives, for which they wanted nothing but
Marriage; others Laundresses, though defiling more than they
washed. At a Passage over a River, ordered the Bridge to be
taken down, that these feminine impediments might not follow
as soon as his Souldiers were over. Whereupon they made such
pannick shreeks as seized the Souldiers hearts on the other side
the River, who vowed not to stir a foot, except with these their
Baggage; which the King was forced to wink at for the present,
smiling out his anger, and permitting now what he might, and
did amend afterwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But greatest Piety, the best Cause, the strictest Discipline, the
most faithful Service may miscarry in this world, where we are
sure no person can discern <hi>either the love or the hatred of the great
Governor of the world, by any thing that is under the Sun.</hi> For he saw
prosperous Villany trampling on unhappy Allegiance, the best
King lying down under the stroke of the worst Executioner; and
himself forced to compound for his estate with those very Rebels
he now scorned, and formerly defied, overcome in all things but
his mind. For the note runs thus in that Record, which we are
bound to forgive, but History will not forget.</p>

               <p>In the primitive times, like these I write of, made up of suffering,

advanced the honor of Confessors for their incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

great cause; on the other side, of those that suffered for it, being
hardly thought by that wicked world worthy to live, and yet not
so happy as to be suffered to dye.</p>

elsewhere to do them the utmost right I am able, that is, to
give the world a faithful Narrative of their exemplary virtues,

and <hi>We may well spare our superfluities, to serve the Kings neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</hi>
To conclude, a man this so happy in his Invention, that
in all his Loyal and Worthy Designs he was never at a loss, but so
projected all his courses, that a second began commonly where the

his Workmen in the Mine. She so contrived it, that the bread
and meat were most artificially made of gold, and the King was
much delighted with the conceit thereof, till at last he called for
real meat, to satisfie his more than imaginary hunger.</hi> Nay (said

his Pistol, which being laid on a Table, by chance went off and
killed a Gentlewoman; whereupon, O the difference of divers
men in the tenderness of their consciences! some are scarce <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
with a wound, whil'st others are wounded with a touch <hi>therein,</hi>
he was so troubled, though it was done so much against his will,
that it was without his knowledge, that, as his estate came in as
long as he lived, he posted in his blew Wast-coat with a round sum
to his Ghostly Father, being in pain till it was piously disposed, and
taking the good course to make his own Eyes his Overseers, and
his own Hands Executors, that as he had been by accident the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

               <p>I say, not to mention these and many more inferior persons of
this Loyal name, that with young <hi>David,</hi> were ambitious of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
in that cause with integrity, wherein the elder branches
were involved with honor, the meanest of them carrying the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>

               <p>Sir <hi>George Berkley,</hi> than whom few that lived so many pious, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
withal so many sad days, having his life equally divided between
his own and the Nations calamities, in which (being too serious
and thoughtful a man to preserve his safety with the price of his
conscience, and being better able to suffer than to fear) he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<hi>first</hi> in his Vote and Suffrage, as one that dared to stand to
his reason against his interest, more tender of the least trouble in
his breast and conscience, than concerned in the greatest Tumults
in the Street and City. <hi>Next,</hi> in his Withdrawing, leaving the
House when the House forgot, and left that for which they were
called together, designing to discountenance those practices with
his absence, that he could not restrain by his presence; and after

that in his contributions, supporting that Cause in the Field with
his estate, that he had in vain indeavoured to have kept up in the
Councils by his argument. He was able to maintain it with his
purse, when he could not with his advice; and when he had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
with his personal service, both in raising men to serve
his Majesty by reputation, and in disposing them advantageously
by his prudence: He commanded but a little of the Army he was
<hi>in,</hi> but all the Country he was <hi>of;</hi> having been a good <hi>Patriot,</hi>
though not pretending to be a good Souldier; the greatest service
he could do the King, was by the exemplariness of his conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which those of his own side might imitate, as they of the
other side did envy, looking upon a godly Cavalier as a dangerous
person; who confuted their slanders, and out-did in reality as
much as they could pretend to, having the best way of honoring
the King by fearing God, and being of opinion that they could
not be faithful Subjects to the one, that were not conscientious
Servants to the other; being so serious, that he was seldom seen to
laugh, an observation made of his Saviour; and so solid, that he

unworthy expression of the worst-deserving of all the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
because, though it became them well to hear ill, yet it did
not become the other side to speak so; it being below a good cause
to be defended by evil speaking, which might anger, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
and discover the ill spirit of the party that managed the
cause, instead of keeping up the merit of the cause that was
managed.</p>
               <p>He was sad all his time, but grew melancholy in the latter end
of it (conscience speaking than loudest, when men are able to
speak least, and all sores paining most near night) (when he was

rather serious than sad, rather consideration than a grief; and
his preparation for death, rather than his disease leading to it;
wherein his losses were his greatest satisfaction, and his sufferings
his most considerable comfort. Being infinitely pleased with two
things, King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyrs rational and heroick management

an argument he thought that it was reason and not power, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that convinced the conscience, and not something that mens

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59370:72"/>
the Kings side; the reason he chearfully paid three thousand five
hundred and forty pounds for his Allegiance, as he had chearfully
kept to it; the only two instances of his life that pleased him. If
any body demand, how he could suffer so much as he did at last,
and do as much as he did at first; and how he could lay out so
much to pious uses, whom it had cost so dear to be a good subject?
The <hi>Spanish</hi> Proverb must satisfie him; <hi>That which cometh from
above, let no man question.</hi> Though indeed he was so innocent in
that age, that he could not be rich; and of the same temper and
equal fortune with Judge <hi>Cateline</hi> (that Judge in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi>
time, that had a fancy full of prejudice against any man that writ
his name with an <hi>alias,</hi> and took exception against one on this very
account, saying, That no honest man had a double name, or came
in with an <hi>alias.</hi> And the party asked him (as <hi>Cambden</hi> tells the

               <p>ONe of those honest persons, that though ashamed of the
Kings usage in <hi>London,</hi> were sorry for the necessity of his
removal out of it, which left the City liable to the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
and practices, and his friends there obnoxious to the fallacies
and violences of a Faction, that had all along abused, and now
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59370:72"/>
awed the Kings leige people, that could not before, by reason of
their pretences, discern what was right, nor now by reason of
their power, own it. This noble person did not think it advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to go from <hi>Westminster,</hi> because his estate lay near the City,
yet he served the King there, because his inclination (especially
when he was disabused) was for <hi>Oxford.</hi> He was of his Majesties
opinion at the first Sitting of the Long Parliament, that to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with the Parliament in some reasonable and moderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
was the way to prevent them from running into any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
and unreasonable. The stream that is yielded to run
smoothly, if it be stopped, it fometh and rageth; but his honest
nature being deceived in the confidence he had in others, whom
he measured by himself (that is, the advantage the cunning man
hath over the honest) pitied their unreasonableness, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
of his own charity and hope; and ever after went along
with them in accommodations for peace, but by no means concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in any preparations for war; insomuch, that when he despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of reason from the Houses, he was contented to deal with the
particular Members of them, being willing to hearken to Master
<hi>Waller,</hi> and some others Proposal, about letting in the King to the
City, by an Army to be raised there, according to the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
brought to Town by the Lady <hi>Aubigney,</hi> when he could not
open his way by the arguments used by him and others in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.
Being a plain and honest man, the factious papers and
discourses took not with him, they were so forced, dark, canting
and wrested. The Kings Declaration being embraced, and as far
as he durst, published and communicated by him, because clear, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and honest. He might possibly sit so long at <hi>Westminster</hi> as
to be suspected and blamed for adhering to the Rebellion, but he
was really with the Earls of <hi>Suffolk, Lincoln, Middlesex;</hi> the Lords
<hi>Willoughby, Hunsdon</hi> and <hi>Maynard,</hi> impeached at <hi>Westminster</hi> of
High-treason, in the name of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> for levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
war against the King, Parliament and Kingdom. It may be
thought a fault, that he vouchsafed the Juncto his company, when
they debated any overtures of peace; but it was his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he retired, when the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> was Voted General,
the King, the Bishops and Delinquents lands seized on, the New
Seal made, the War prosecuted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And appeared only to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
the Faction in such times as he might hope, either to bring
things to some composure, or keep them from confusion; offering
expedients, and protesting against extravagancies, especially in
the two cases of declaring those that indeavoured the Restitution
of the Kings Majesty 1647, 1648. Traytors, and in the Vote <hi>That
the Earl of</hi> Warwick <hi>should fight the Prince.</hi> These passages cost
him a long Imprisonment under the Black-Rod, Sequestra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the House, and what he bewailed more, an utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity
of serving his Majesty, which he was very much afraid
of ever since they had suffered the new model of the Army,
the greatest errour since the first of raising it: For ever after
he lived to bewail the mischiefs of a Civil War, but not to see any

hope of remedy. Most Children are notified by their Parents,
yet some Fathers are made eminent by their Children, as <hi>Simon</hi> of

which Lord (as the said <hi>Trevisa</hi> observeth) had the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps

Life and Death
OF
M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> JOHN DOD.</head>
            <p>AFTER so many honorable persons that could do so
much for his Majesty, here's a Reverend Person that
could suffer for him; one that was not over-fond of
the Government when it prospered, but faithful to it
when it suffered, declaring as zealously against the
scandalous Rebellion of the Puritans, as he had done for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Religion, the Non-conformist Cavalier. One that bewailed
his own scruples, and perswaded all men to have a care of them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch,
as that when Bishop <hi>Brownrigge</hi> in his younger days went
to him for his advice, he wished him, and other hopeful men, not
to ensnare themselves into uselesseness.</p>
            <p>In the midst of troublesome times, he quietly withdrew himself
to heaven. He was born at <hi>Shotledge</hi> in <hi>Cheshire</hi> (the youngest of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
Children) bred in <hi>Westchester,</hi> and <hi>Iesus Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</hi>
At a Disputation at one Commencement he was so faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
solid (wild, yet sweet fruits which the stock brought forth
before grafted with grace) that <hi>Oxford</hi>-men there present, courted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59370:74"/>
him home with them, and would have planted him in their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,
save that he declined it.</p>
            <p>He was a <hi>Passive Non-conformist,</hi> not loving any one the worse for
difference in judgment about Ceremonies, the better for their
unity of affections in Grace and Goodness: He used to retrench
some hot spirits when envying against Bishops, telling them
how God under that government had given a marvellous increase
to the Gospel, and that godly men might comfortably comport
therewith, under which Learning and Religion had so manifest an
improvement. He was a good <hi>Decalogist,</hi> and to his dying day
(how roughly soever used) stuck to his own judgment, of what
he had written on the <hi>fifth Commandment,</hi> of obedience to lawful
Authority.</p>

               <hi rend="margQuotes">Some riotous Gentlemen, casually coming to the Table of

for himself to forbear <hi>Oaths</hi> so long a time. Here at Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> (the

and seasonable discourse (as more better at occasionals) of
what power men have more than they know of themselves to
refrain from sin, and how active Gods restraining grace would
be in us to bridle us from wickedness, were we not wanting to
our selves.</hi>

            <p>Being stricken in years, he used to compare himself to <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
when his hair was cut off. I rise, saith he, in the morning as
<hi>Sampson</hi> did, and think, <hi>I will go out as at other times, Go, Watch,
Walk, Work, Study, Ride, as when a young man; but alas! he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found an alteration, and so do I, who must stoop to age, which hath
clip't my hair, and taken my strength away.</hi>

            <p>Being at <hi>Holdenby,</hi> and invited by an honorable Person to see
that stately house, built by Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton</hi> (the Master-piece
of English Architecture in that age) he desired to be excused, and
to sit still, looking on a <hi>flower</hi> which he had in his hand. <hi>In this
flower</hi> (saith he) <hi>I can see more of God, than in all the beautiful build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in the word.</hi> And at this day, <hi>as his flower is long since withered,</hi>
that magnificent <hi>pile (that fair flower of art)</hi> is altogether blasted
and destroyed.</p>
            <p>It is reported, he was but coursly used by the Souldiers, who
(they say) plundered him of his Linnen and Houshold-stuff,
(though as some tell me) if so disposed, he might have redeemed
all for a very small matter. However the good man still remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
his old Maxime, <hi>Sanctified afflictions are good promotions.</hi> And
I have been credibly informed, that when the Souldiers brought
down his Sheets out of the Chamber, into the Room where Mr.
<hi>Dod</hi> sat by the fire-side, he (in their absence to search after more)
took one pair, and clapt them under his Cushion whereon he sat,
much pleasing himself after their departure that he had (as he said)
<hi>Plundered the Plunderers,</hi> and by a <hi>lawful felony</hi> saved so much of his
own to himself.</p>

put him to a Feaver (and with the consideration of that passage
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. the Law is spiritual, and I am carnal, sold under sin; and
that (as he said) he neither did, nor knew how to pray) brought
him to a sense of his sin and state, and after much humiliation, to
a comfortable adherence to God in the Lord Jesus, according to
the sure mercies of the Covenant of grace: And when his ways
pleased the Lord, this adversary desired to be admitted to peace
with him, recollecting the payment of the money, and proving
ever after the most faithful friend he had in all the Colledge. And

            <p>II. Opening it with these rules. 1. That there is but one litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
sence of the Scripture. 2. That if there were no peculiarity
in the Phrase, a short Paraphrase was best. 3. That the Text is to
be first accurately divided, and then clearly explicated. 4. That
the Doctrine should be raised from each head as it was explained.
And that either, 1. Grammatically, by either having recourse to
the Originals, or observing the Synonimous expressions: Or,
2. Rhetorical, by reducing improper expressions to a proper
signification: Or 3. Logical, by distinguishing doubtful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,
and defining the obscure. And all, 1. With a respect
to the Analogy of faith in the Lords Prayer, the Decalogue, the
Apostles Creed, and the Doctrine of the Sacraments. 2. Reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
each observation to a certain head or common place of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
3. Keeping to the primary scope and mind of the spirit in
the place. 4. Comparing spiritual things with spiritual, and one
place of Scripture with another, like or unlike it; but always the
more obscure by the more perspicuous. 5. Keeping an eye upon
the context and the circumstances thereof. And taking in 6. The
consentient Interpretation of the Catholick Church, and the most
eminent men that were acquainted with Gods wil in it, seldom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing
the people with variety of Expositions of the same Text.</p>

III. Drawing out the several Doctrines of the Text, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
from the express words of the Text, or indirectly, 1. From
the Coherence. 2. The Occasion. 3. The Principal Scope. 4. The
Form. 5. The Order. 6. The Connexion. 7. The Variety of the
words signification. 8. The Matter, whether Ecclesiastical, Aecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,
or Political. 9. The Similitute, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 12. 10. From Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Proportions which are to be used. 1. Soberly and sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
2. Not far fetched, but proper. 3. Briefly. 4. Rather for the
reforming of the life, than the proving of any Article of Faith.
5. And after the genuine sence of the word be first sincerely given.
11. From the Circumstance of Time, Person, Place. 12. From Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
wherein it must be observed.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That Examples are in their kinds, Rules, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi>
4. 18, 23.</item>
               <item>2. That whatever good men did as Christians, or Saints, we are
bound to do.</item>
               <item>3. That whatever they did, as endued with a special calling or
a peculiar gift, all persons called to the same calling, and blessed
with the same gift, are bound to do.</item>
               <item>4. That whatever good men did ordinarily, must be imitated or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily,
and what upon especial occasions must be followed upon
those special occasions.</item>

            <p>IV. Handling the Doctrines so drawn out. 1. By way of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that,</p>
            <p>1. By testimonies of Scripture and other Authors; in reference
to which he practised these Rules:
<list>
                  <item>1. Each Doctrine was grounded on two Scripture testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
at least, which he opened and applied.</item>
                  <item>2. Each Quotation was well studied.</item>
                  <item>3. And produced in the Scripture phrase, and therefore
read out of the Bible.</item>
                  <item>4. Choice, and clear.</item>
                  <item>5. One out of the Old Testament, another out of the New,
seldom out of the Apocrypha, unless for institution of
manners.</item>
                  <item>6. With a Preface, shewing the end of each Quotation.</item>
                  <item>7. The Quotation of Fathers, Philosophers, School-men,
Historians, was choice and sparing, only when there
might be such an Emphasis in the place, as might touch
and work upon the conscience, by reasons which he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
(not in respect of the matter to be proved, for that
stood firm enough upon Gods testimony, but of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors
weakness, whose faith was to be established) some
concluding, others only illustrating, all grounded on the
Scripture, and applied distinctly to the respective mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Doctrine.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>V. How artificially would he intimate his Observations in his
Expositions! How orderly would he dispose of them according to
the respective Members of his Divisions! How pithily would he
dispatch his less principal Points; which he shewed his people he
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59370:75"/>
observed, but could not handle; discoursing his more Principal
ones in the order he raised them, and dispatching one before he
medled with the other! How solidly, pithily, and prudently, he
deduced his Proposition (waving all vain, tedious, or controvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
subjects) in clear Scripture-expression! How sweetly would
he paraphrase, and insinuate them to the Auditors! How seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
would he insist upon the Points most agreeable to the present
time and <hi>place!</hi> Being thus furnished, this excellent Person first
bestowed his pains weekly among the good People of <hi>Ely;</hi> then,
upon his great success there, he was recommended by Mr. <hi>Chad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derton</hi>
(who kept an Office as it were for the supply of Patrons,
Schools, and other places with hopeful young men) to Mr. <hi>Cope,</hi>
afterwards Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> at <hi>Hanwell</hi> in <hi>Oxfordshire;</hi> and after twenty
years continuance there (where, upon his seven first Sermons, he
was with the joint consent of Bishop, Patron, and People, legally
established) preaching constantly every Lords day in the morning,
catechizing in the afternoon, keeping hospitality Sundays and
Wednesdays, giving himself much to fasting and prayer; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

complain of the opposition he met with) viz.<note place="margin">Queting for it 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 1. 7. <gap reason="foreign">

his dying day, professing that it did him a great deal of good, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
afflictions patiently; being wont to say, that sanctified afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are great promotions. He removed to <hi>Fenny-Compton</hi> in <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick-shire;</hi>
and thence, upon some discontent between him and
Bishop <hi>Neal,</hi> to <hi>Cannons-Ashbie</hi> in <hi>Northampton-shire,</hi> where he obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
most of the Gentry of that greatest County of Gentlemen in
<hi>England;</hi> and thence he was invited by Mr. <hi>Richard Knightley</hi> to
<hi>Tansley</hi> in the same County, where his Hospitality and Charity
grew so with his Estate, that there was not a poor body left in his
Neighbourhood, he having set them all in a way to live.</p>
            <p>A Father (who shall pass nameless) is censured by some for his
over-curiosity in his conceit, rather than Comment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 2.
<hi>And he opened his mouth, and taught them;</hi> for Christ (saith he)
taught them often when he opened not his mouth, by his example,
miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here I am sure, according to Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> when his
mouth was shut (prohibited preaching) instructed almost as much
as before, by his holy demeanour, and pious discourse. A good
Chimist, who could extract Gold out of other mens lead; and
how loose soever the promises of other mens discourse, piety was
always his natural and unforced conclusion inferred thereupon.
He had much imployment in comforting such as were wounded in
their spirits; being sent for not onely nigh at home, but also into
remote Countries.</p>
            <p>There was a Gentlewoman who had a great worldly Estate, and
a loving Husband, but she was so sadly assaulted with tentations,
that she often attempted to make away her self. Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> was sent
for to come to her, and the Lord so blessed his Counsels, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Prayers, that she did not onely recover out of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of spirit, but she was afterwards taken notice of for her sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59370:76"/>
piety; and the Lord so ordered, that this affliction was not
onely the means of her conversion, but also of her Husbands; so
that both of them were a great mercy in the Countrey where they
lived, promoting Religion according to their power, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
and cherishing godly people: She lived divers years quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in her heart, and being rich in good works; and when she lay
on her death-bed, Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> was sent for to her again, who spake of
Heaven, and to fit her for that Glory: She told him, that she felt
the comforts of God, and that she could as hardly at that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
singing, as formerly in child-bearing she could forbear crying;
and shortly after she died.</p>
            <p>There was a Gentleman related to a Noble Family, so perplexed
in his mind, that he hath been known in hard frosts to go bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed,
that the pain of his feet might divert his thoughts. Master
<hi>Dod</hi> was sent for to him, who was his spiritual Physician to heal
him.</p>
            <p>He always expected troubles, and prepared himself for them;
and put this difference between the affliction for which we are
provided, and others; that the one are but blows on the harness,
but the other are blows on the flesh.</p>
            <p>Upon a time when an affliction was upon him, which went to
his very heart, and in the expectation whereof he wept; yet when
he saw that it was the will of God that it should be so, he said to
one whom he loved, <hi>I will go and bless God, for I believe this shall be
for my good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He gave himself much to fasting and prayer; and when he fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
his custome was to abstain from the dinner of the day before,
to the supper of the day after, his diseases being mostly Feavers;
in one of which, when his Physician Dr. <hi>Oxenbridge</hi> said to him,
<hi>Well, now I have hope of your recovery;</hi> he answered, <hi>You think to
comfort me by this, but you make my heart sad; it is, as you should tell
one who had been sore weather-beaten on the Sea, and conceiving that he
was arrived at the Haven where his soul longed to be, that he must come
back again to be tossed with new winds and waves.</hi> In his greater health
and prosperity, he would speak how he desired to be dissolved:
Upon a time a Gentleman blamed him for it; saying, <hi>He liked not
servants who would have their wages before they had done their work;</hi>
But he seemed to be constant in this desire, alledging these reasons
among others, That God had given him a setled assurance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and a sight of the excellency of Heaven; and that the Earth
was but a prison, and Heaven the Palace; and there was perfect
holiness and happiness.</p>
            <p>He took all occasions to do good when he was in company,
by godly speeches seasoning those which came to him, that unless
it were their own fault, they might be the better for him.</p>
            <p>Being invited to a great Feast, where there were sundry Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and some of them began to swear, he stopt them by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
of the greatness of that sin; and that he might not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
their memories, he quoted three Chapters, every one was
the first; as, the first of <hi>Zachary,</hi> the first of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the first
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59370:76"/>
of <hi>Iames;</hi> and he opened those Scriptures in such sort, that they
were all hushed, and did not again offend in that kind while he
was present amongst them.</p>
            <p>The Word of God was his great delight, his meditation was of
it in the night, and his discourse in the day. When those that
were with him were speaking of earthly things, he would finde
out some way to bring in Heavenly. When he could not sleep in
the night, he would say, <hi>That the meditation of the Word was sweeter
to him than sleep.</hi> When he had preached twice on the Sabbath, and
was a weary, yet to those that came to him, he would go on afresh
in holy Discourses; and the comforts which he found in his soul,
made him sometimes forget his body, that he hath been speaking
till he was ready to faint.</p>
            <p>His eminency was in frequency, aptness, freeness, and largeness
of godly discourse; in which respect it may be said of him, that
in the Countrey where he lived, none were known who therein
were equal to him. But he was, <hi>Mi cans inter omnes, velut inter
ignes luna minores.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was very merciful himself, and to move Parents that were
rich to mercy, he would say thus: <hi>You are caring and contriving to
lay up for your children; but lay up for your selves a good foundation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the time to come, being rich in good works; you will lay up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in the earth, which is an unsafe place, lay up treasure in Heaven,
that is the sure and safe place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Master <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> an approved good man, dying the same
year of a Consumption, came to <hi>Asby,</hi> not far from <hi>Tansley,</hi> to have
the help of Master <hi>Dod</hi>'s comforts and counsels; he was oppressed
with melancholy, and a little before he gave up his soul to Christ,
<hi>What can ye say of him that is going out of the world, and can finde no
comfort?</hi> To whom he answered, <hi>What will you say of our Saviour
Christ, who when he was going out of the world found no comfort, but
cried out, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> This speech
refreshed Master <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> and within a little space of time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, he went to his heavenly Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Master <hi>Dod,</hi> as he was of a weaned disposition from the World
himself: so he laboured to wean others. He put this difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
rich Christians and poor, That for poor Christians their
Father kept the purse; but the rich Christians keep the purse in
their own hands: But it might oftner fall out, and did, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the purse was better in the Fathers hand than in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
He was wont to compare wicked men to waves of the Sea;
those which were of a great Estate, were great waves; those which
were of small estate, were small waves; but all were restless as
waves.</p>
            <p>To a friend of his, that raised from a mean estate to worldly
greatness, he sent word, That this was but as if he should go out
of a Boat into a Barge or Ship, but there ought to be a serious
and godly remembrance, that while we are in this world we are
upon the sea. He often repeated this, That nothing could hurt
us but our own sins, and they should not hurt us, if we truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59370:77"/>
for them; and nothing could do us good but Gods favour,
and that we should be sure of, if we unfeignedly sought it. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Davids</hi> penning the 51. <hi>Psalm,</hi> after his murther and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
put this gloss upon it, That hearty and true repentance shall
have cause to praise the Lord for his pardoning mercy.</p>
            <p>He said, Afflictions were Gods Potions, he might sweeten by faith
and faithful prayer; but we for the most part made them bitter,
puting into Gods cup the ill ingredients of our own impatience
and unbelief. He gave this reason why many of Gods people liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
uncomfortably, for that they shut their ear against what God
said, where they should open it; and they opened their ear to what
their carnal reason, and Satan, and the world said, where they
should shut it: but (said he) the <hi>Psalmist</hi> was wiser, <hi>Psal.</hi> 85. 8. he
would hear none of them all, <hi>I will hear what the Lord God will
speak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Preaching was searching, and when some did suppose that
he had Informers and Spies, because he came so close to them; he
answered, That the Word of God was searching, and that if he
was shut up in a dark Vault, where none could come at him; yet
allow him but a Bible and a Candle, and he should Preach as he
did.</p>
            <p>He had an excellent gift in similitudes, which did flow freely
and frequently from him, as all those knew, who either heard him
Preach publickly, or discourse privately. He called Death the
friend of Grace, though it were the enemy of Nature, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Word, and Sacraments, and Prayer, do but weaken sin,
death builds it. Speaking of prayer, he said, a man was never in
a hard condition, unless he had a hard heart, and could not pray.</p>
            <p>Having Preached out of that Text, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith,
be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</hi> He invited some women to Dinner,
and told them it was a usual saying, Let a Woman have her will,
and then she shall be quiet. Now the way for a woman to have
her will, is to have a strong faith, and to pray as that woman in the
Gospel did.</p>
            <p>Upon a time, when he had Preached long, so that it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
late before he went to dinner, he said, You shall have some
Gentlemen will follow Hounds from seven in the morning, till
four or five in the afternoon, because they love the cry of Dogs,
which to me was unpleasant hearing. So if we love the Word, we
should be content, though the Minister stood above his hour. And
he added, me thinks it much better to hear a Minister preach, than
a Kennel of Hounds to bark. Speaking of recreation, he said, he
marvelled what the vocation of many was, who were so eager for
recreation. And if we should come into a house, and see many
Physick-boxes and Glasses, we would conclude some body is sick.
So when we see Hounds, and Hawks, and Cards, and Dice, we may
fear there is some sick soul in that Family. He told some friends,
that if he were to pass sentence who was a rich man, he would
not look into his Purse or Chest, how much gold he had laid up,
but look into his heart, what promises were treasured up there.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59370:77"/>
For we count him rich that is rich in bonds, and the pleading of the
promises in prayer, is suing of the bonds.</p>
            <p>Speaking to a Minister, who was to go to a place where there
was but small means, he told him, That his care was to Preach, and
do God service, and then God would provide for him. When he
preached at <hi>Fausley,</hi> &amp; was much resorted unto, he told a godly man
of his acquaintance, that if the Country knew so much by him, as he
knew by himself, they would not have him in so much admiration.</p>
            <p>Speaking about going to Law, his opinion was, that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to buy Love than Law; for one might have a great deal of
Love for a little, whereas he could have but a little Law for a great
deal. He would frequently say, that was not well, which ended ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
ill, and that a man was never undone till he was in hell.</p>
            <p>This was a Speech which he often used, that if it were lawful
to envy any, he would envy those that turned to God in youth,
whereby they escape much sin and sorrow, and were like unto <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
that stole the blessing betimes. He died (praying heartily for
the King, and declaiming as heartily against the Rebellion, that
would make such a breach in this State; and be such a scandal to
this Church, as the Child unborn should rue and bewail.</p>

            <p>WE remember, when Oratory and Faction had attained

               <q>That it seemed to many Gentlemen, a spectacle no less
strange than sad, to see three of several professions, the noblest
in the kingdom, Divinity, Law, and Physick, exposed at one time
to such ignominious punishment,</q> forsooth: And truly we are
at present under a great doubt, whether it was a more sad, or
a more pleasant sight, to see so many eminent men, of all
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59370:78"/>
these and other ingenious professions, act so chearfully, and suffer
so patiently for that Government, which those before-mentioned,
endeavoured first to disgrace, and at last to overthrow. First, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauching
men from their love and reverence to Superiors, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
them to scorn and contempt; and next, from their duty to
them, by opposing and fighting them.</p>
            <p>There went immediately before, a very Reverend Divine, that
in the midst of many discouragements, zealously discried the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of the Supream and Lawful power, as against Conscience:
And now he is followed by a worthy Lawyer, that eagerly opposed
any thing that tended to it, as against Law.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Trevor</hi> was born <hi>Iuly</hi> the 6. 1586. (a day memorable
in that Family for the birth of six successives principal branches of
it, born upon it) with this remarkable occurrence, That whereas
most other Children are born to this sad world crying, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to smile almost as soon as born, an argument of the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
temper he was of, until he died. His Temper lead him to the
active ways of a Souldier, or a Courtier, but his judgment carried
him to the more studious employment of a Lawyer, wherein he
promised great proficiency from that towardliness at School, that
never deserved correction, and success in the University, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
failed of applause; in both such strong parts, that his Master
would say of him, <hi>This Boy hath not the patience to stay at the words
in Authors, he is so inquisitive after the thing.</hi> And his Tutor, <hi>That
he had a strange Natural Logick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Rumbald</hi> [I write what I read, not what I believe] as soon
as he came out of his Mothers womb falling into the Churches bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
cried three times the first minute of his life, <hi>I am a Christian;</hi>
made a confession of his Faith, desired to be Baptized, chose his
God-fathers, his Name, and his Font. This the fable, the moral
shall be the early seriousness of this person; seriousness and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being of <hi>Vives</hi> his opinion, that a pious Youth resisting its
own temptations, and allaying its own heat, makes a comfortable
and a serviceable Age, neither sad with a mans own remembrances
of younger follies, nor useless by the disgrace of others observing
of them.</p>
            <p>Many men are lost in their more reduced years, by reason of the

his Antagonists were afraid to anger him who had most wit in his
anger, as much as <hi>Aristotle</hi> observeth, others designed to provoke

clear, pertinent, useful and approved; and especially a man must
have the <hi>Year-books</hi> and Statutes. His Counsel to the King was with
the like freedom as these directions to the young Gentlemen; and
his Judgment on the Bench, with as much faithfulness as either.</p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> in a year of great mortality amongst them, had their
children born without their cheek-teeth: This Judge especially in
sad times, and in a sad case, would have all Pleadings without bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
his Nature was pitiful and ingenuous; insomuch, that he
might be called, as <hi>Tostanus</hi> was, <hi>The Patron of Infirmities.</hi> His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
was always charitable, either to excuse their failings, or
mitigate their punishments. The favour he shewed others, he
found not himself: His concurring with his Brethren about Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money,
being aggravated with the most odious circumstances, and
punished with the severe usage of a Prison, a Fine, and the loosing
of his Place; a great argument certainly of his Integrity, that in
a searching Age, he that had been Judge near upon twenty years,
could be found guilty of no fault, but avowing the Law according
to his Judgement, and being of opinion, <hi>That the King, in case of
danger, whereof he was Iudge, might tax the Nation to secure its self.</hi>
An opinion <hi>so innocent,</hi> that Justice <hi>Hutton</hi> himself, who went to
his grave with the reputation of an honest Judge, would protest
he could heartily wish true, it being as much for the Interest of the
Nation, as it seemed to him against the Law of it: <hi>So legal,</hi> that
Baron <hi>Denham,</hi> though he was sick and could not debate it with
his Brethren, and something scrupulous that if he had been there,
he could not have agreed with them: yet it appears his dissent was
not from his apprehension of the injustice of the Tax, called Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money,
in general, but from some particular irregularity in the
proceeding with Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi> in particular; as appears from this
Certificate, dated <hi>May</hi> 26. 1638. directed to the Lord Chief Justice
<hi>Brampston.</hi>

               <p>UPon the humble Address, by the humble Petition of Sir <hi>George
Crook</hi> Knight, who after many years Service done both to
Our deceased Father, and Our Self, as Our said Fathers Serjeant
at Law; and one of His, and Our Judges of Our <hi>Benches</hi> at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
hath humbly besought Us, by reason of the Infirmity of
his old Age, (which disableth him to continue to perform Us such
service, as he much desireth to have, according to his duty, done)
his further Attendance might be by Us in Our Grace dispensed
with; To the end all Our loving Subjects who have, and shall
faithfully serve Us (as We declare this Our Servant hath done)
may know, That as We shall never expect, much less require, or
exact from them performances beyond what their healths and
years shall enable them; so We shall not dismiss them without an
Approbation of their Service, when We find they shall have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, much less expose them in their old Age to neglect. As
Our Princely Testimony therefore, that the said Sir <hi>George Crooks</hi>
being dispensed withal, proceeds from Us at the humble Request
of the said Sir <hi>George Crook</hi> (which We have cause, and do take
well, that he is rather willing to acknowledge his Infirmity by his
great Age occasioned, than that by concealing of the same any want
of Justice should be to Our People) and not out of any Our least
displeasure conceived against him; Do hereby Declare Our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Pleasure, That We are graciously pleased, and do hereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with the said Sir <hi>George Crook</hi>'s further Attendance in the
said Courts, or in any Our Circuits. And as a Token of Our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of his former good and acceptable Service by the said
Sir <hi>George Crook</hi> done to Our deceased Father, and Our Self, do
yet continue him one of Our Judges of Our said <hi>Bench;</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Declare Our further Will and Pleasure to be, That during his

Us to him, the like Fee and Fees as was to him, or is, or shall be by
Us paid to any other of Our Judges of Our said <hi>Bench</hi> at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59370:80"/>
                  <hi>Launceston</hi> where the Assizes are holden) ready to knock down all
the Lawyers that should offer to plant themselves in that County.
This man was brought to <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall door <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
or able Lawyer daring to appear there upon pain of forfeiting
either his Conscience, in complying with the Tumult; or his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
Liberty, yea and Life too in dissenting from it. Otherwise
our Judge deserved to be <hi>Comes Imperii primi Ordinis,</hi> according to
the Constitution of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperor, allowing that honor to
Lawyers, <hi>Cum ad viginti annos observatione Iugi ac sedulo docendi la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore

               </p>
               <p>Having been twenty years a Judge, that would hear patiently,
help Witnesses laboring in their Delivery condescendingly, check
forward Speakers gravely, dealt impartially his private Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
being swallowed up in the common Concern, as Rivers loose
their names in the Ocean. Cut off Delays and impertinent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
discreetly; was zealous of kindness, because fearful of
Bribes: Great obligations upon persons in Place, like wandering
Preachers Sermons, end in begging; merciful in his Judgement.
A Butcher may not be of the Jury, much less should he be a Judge.
Being outed his Place with as much honor, as others are advanced,
glorying in that, though the Parliament could make him no Judge,
they could not make him no upright Judge. He lived privately
the rest of his days, having besides the estate got by his Practice, no
mean estate by his Birth, and by his Marriage; having little refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
on his own condition, he was so taken up with the sad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>And thus we leave our Judge to receive a just reward of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity

at the great Assize of the world.</p>

slow and deliberate death, against the stream of sensual in

things past, by means whereof repentance is perfected, patience
is exercised, the Joys of Heaven are leisurely represented; the

gained by private Practise in their Chambers; the people willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
trusting their Estates in those Worthy Persons hands, with
whom the King had instrusted the Law; being confident of their
faithfulness to them, who had approved themselves so faithful to
their Soveraign. And that they would not wrest the Law, who
suffered so much rather than betray it.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>observed,</hi> that when Sir <hi>Iohn Cary,</hi> Chief Baron of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi>

<hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, or any thing which he had learned long before, but
forgot whatsoever was newly told him: His memory like an Inn
retaining <hi>Old</hi> Guests, but affording no room to entertain <hi>New.</hi> It
is pity, that he that kept the exact date of every eminent Lawyer
in his own time, should want an exact account of his own. He
was Born in <hi>Cheshire</hi> (where are 1. The Most, 2. The most Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,

Iuly</hi> 7. 1584. the same day that his Father and Mother died
both together within a quarter of one another. When my Father
and my Mother forsake me, <hi>for want of natural affection</hi> to pity me; <hi>for
want of wisdom</hi> not knowing what to do with me, <hi>for want of power</hi>
not able to help me, or <hi>by death</hi> being forced to leave me. The
gracious God, that when a Father forgets his bowels cannot forget
his love which is his own nature: The All-wise God, that when we
are at a loss ordereth all things by the eternal Counsel of his Will.
The Almighty God, that when we are weak doth whatsoever he
pleaseth in Heaven and Earth. The Immortal God that Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
Eternity, that when Friends are gone will never leave us,
never forsake us: This Lord will take us up, then the Lord took
him up, not immediately, Miracles being ceased, but in, and by the
hands, 1. Of Generous and Noble Guardians, that much impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his Estate as well as himself. 2. Of two Excellent School-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
and Tutors, in Memory of whom he kept his own Birth-day,
as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did that of <hi>Theseus,</hi> doing alwayes some thing in
Memory of his <hi>Teachers;</hi> as they sacrificed a Ramme in Memory of
his, having designed (we know not whether performed) the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment

2. Hopeful men slur it over in their way to a more profitable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
3. Indiscreet men meddle with this that understand

Life and Death
OF
Sir GEORGE RATCLIFFE.</head>
            <p>THIS Gentleman might say as one of the fore-going
Judges did, <hi>That he had been a very happy man, had it
not been for that he was born in that age, wherein it was
fatal to give good counsel.</hi> He was Born <hi>Anno</hi> 1587.
at ... in <hi>York-shire,</hi> most of his relation taking to the
Sword that gives laws (whereof 3. slain at <hi>Musele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh-field,</hi>
2. died in the suppression of the Northern Rebellion
63 in 88. and 2. (whereof that excellent person Sir <hi>Iohn Ratcliffe,</hi>
who when with Sir <hi>Charles Rich</hi> being sick, and desired by the Duke
of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to retire into the Ships, returned, <hi>No, they came to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59370:83"/>
fight;</hi> and leaning on their Pikes challenged death its self) at the
<hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Rhee.</hi> He was bred to the Laws that were made by the Sword,
so earnest was he in the behalf of those laws, when there was a
suspicion that they should be made void by an Arbitrary power
and Prerogative, that I find Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworth</hi> removed from
<hi>York-shire</hi> to <hi>Essex,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Ratcliffe</hi> to <hi>Hertford-shire,</hi> to be
confined for stickling in the Parliaments, <hi>Anno</hi> 1625, 1626. and yet
so zealous he was for the Kings Prerogative and just Power, when
it was in a real hazard to be over-born with tumults and combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in the behalf of pretended Laws, that I find Sir <hi>George Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe</hi>
involved in all the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> troubles. None will
question his worth, that considereth him as the great Consident of
that Earl in his affairs; and all persons must needs confess his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
that observeth him that excellent persons companion in all
his sufferings. The Lord Viscount <hi>Wentworth</hi> understood men
and therefore when he was advanced President in the North, he
made him Atturney General at <hi>York,</hi> and he was so sensible of
serviceableness there, that when he was called to the Leiutenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he carried him as his chief favourite over thither.
Where his contrivance was so good, that Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> gave
10000. Pistols for a Copy of a model, pretended to be Sir <hi>George
Ratcliffes,</hi> Intituled <hi>A model for the improvement and safeguard of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
So happy his faculty of perswading, that it was said of his
Speeches, as it was of <hi>Ciceroes, That the longest was the best.</hi> And so
nimble his activity, that (though sometimes he permitted a design
to be matter of discourse before it was finished, to see how it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
with the vulgar, and try how it appeared to the wise) gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
he thought not an affair well done, unless it was done before
others thought of it. So subtile his wit, that a Reverend Judge
upon his proceeding Barrister in the Inns of Court, Pronounced,
<hi>Likely to prove either the best or the worst Instrument in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
And that he would see through and unravil the intrigues
of the most intangled business, or the most reserved man that he
had to do with. And of so comprehensive a brain, that besides
the Customs, the Manufactue, the Products, and the Trade of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
wherein he had a great share. He managed 4. of the 25
Cole-mines, 6. of the 86. Mills, and had in his hand 12. of the 275.

of <hi>England;</hi> by the same token, that when the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi>
looked upon it as the Garden of <hi>Brittain,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Traquaire</hi>
answered, It might be a Garden, but that it was too far from the
House, meaning <hi>London.</hi>) The <hi>Gagites</hi> is a precious stone to be
found only in the Eagles nest, and this Gentleman was a man of
such choice parts, as could be expected only in the sharp-sighted
Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> Cabinet; who would not entertain your fine,
but useless wits, which he compared to Jet, the Northern Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
that could draw straw to it only, having no power over
more weighty bodies. But liked this person the better for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

water inflames Jet; and easiness allayed it, as oil quenches that.
When Sir <hi>Thomas Challoner</hi> (Tutor to Prince <hi>Henry</hi>) had found
Alum near <hi>Gesburgh</hi> in this County; On this occasion, they are the
words of an eye-witness, transcribed by my worthy friend, <q>he
observed the leaves of trees thereabouts more deeply green, than
elsewhere, the Oakes broad-spreading, but not deep rooted,

coloured; here white, there yellow, there blew, and the ways
therein, in a clear night, glistering like glass; symptomes which

Alum most properly.</q> Some Gentlemen of the neighbour-hood

his Patron, since he setled a perplexed conveiance for him at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
acquainted him with so many serviceable men that were at
his devotion in the North; (for the observing of and acquainting

<hi>November</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>George Ratcliffe</hi> was sent for the same day by a Serjeant at
Arms dispatched into <hi>Ireland,</hi> who accordingly <hi>December</hi> 4. came
in, and yielded himself to the Speaker, from whence he was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Custody, and an Impeachment drawn up against him,
consisting of these Articles:</p>
            <p>First, <hi rend="margQuotes">That he had conspired and joyned with the Earl of
<hi>Strafford,</hi> to bring into <hi>Ireland</hi> an Arbitrary Government, and to
subvert the Fundamental Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi rend="margQuotes">That he had indeavoured to bring in an Army from
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to subdue the Subjects of <hi>England.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi rend="margQuotes">That he joyned with the Earl to use Regal Power,
and to deprive Subjects of their Liberty and Property.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi rend="margQuotes">That he joyned with him to take out forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
pounds out of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and bought To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco
therewith, and converted the profit thereof to their own
uses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi rend="margQuotes">That he hath traiterously Confederated with the Earl
to countenance Papists, and built Monasteries, to alienate the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of the <hi>Irish</hi> Subjects from the subjection of <hi>England.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>

            <p>An Impeachment they drew, that they might confine him; but
prosecuted not, lest they should shame themselves, but permitting
him to go whither he would; they waited the event of things,
and when that fell out much beyond their expectation, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured

to condemn him unheard: In all their Treaties with his
Majesty, inserting Sir <hi>George Ratcliffe</hi> (that Mr. <hi>Hampden</hi> said, <hi>was
one of the most dangerous men that adhered to the King</hi>) for one that
they would have <hi>utterly excluded Pardon.</hi> The main instance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they intended to render him odious, was doubtless his severity
to the Children and Relations of those that came under the lash, as
disaffected to the Government; but since <hi>Proles est pars parentis,</hi>
and one part of the body suffereth for the offences of the other,
(the hand steals, the feet are stocked; the tongue forswears, the

Innocent Children; those Pledges Common-wealths have that
men will be quiet. When he had privately detected the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious,

Faction, he died <hi>Anno</hi> 165. ... Leaving these remarques behinde
him, 1. That with <hi>Tamerlain,</hi> he never bestowed place on a man
that was over-ambitious for it. 2. That he feared more the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting,
than the discovery of an Irregularity; That he gave
away to Charitable Uses a tenth of what he got, that he loved a

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
DOCTOR POTTER,
Lord Bishop of Carlisle.</head>
            <p>IN a time when this Kingdom flourished with Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Edifices, the Trade of the Nation had brought the
Wealth of the <hi>Indies</hi> to our doors; Learning and all
good Sciences were so cherished, that they grew to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and many Arts of the Ancients buried and
forgotten by time, were revived again; no Subjects happier, though
none less sensible of their Happiness. Security increasing the
Husband mans stock, and Justice preserved his Life; the poor
might Reverence, but needed not fear the Great; and the Great
though he might despise, yet could not injure his more obscure
Neighbor; and all things were so administred, that they seemed
to conspire to the Publick good; except that they made our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
<hi>too much the cause of our Civil Commotions,</hi> and brought our
Felicity to that height, that by the necessity of humane Affairs,
that hath placed all things in motion, it must necessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline.
At this happy time, thus happily expressed by Dr. <hi>Perrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,</hi>
and Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> it was that I will not say the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
for the better part of it abhorred it, but to phrase the Men
the Lord <hi>Digby's way,</hi> I know not what, 15000 Londoners, all that
could be got to subscribe, complained in a Petition that Trade was
obstructed, Grievances increased, Patents and Monopolies multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
meerly because of the Bishops, who were looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as the Great <hi>Grievance</hi> of the Kingdom; in somuch that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor

Mr. <hi>Maxwell</hi> at School in the place where he was born, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Puritane Tutor in Queens Colledge in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and looked
upon as so great a Puritane in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, that they would
say in jest, that the noise of an Organ would blow him out the
Church; and therefore he was called tho Puritanical Bishop,
(though his love to Musick no doubt was as great as his Skill, and
his Skill so good that he could bear a part in it) yet because he was
a Bishop, he was slighted when he came to <hi>London</hi> as Iuke warm,
and forsaken as Popish, that had been so followed formerly as the
most godly and powerful <hi>Preacher:</hi> He had been a great Tutor at
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59370:86"/>
Queens, where he had learned to train others by the Discipline
he had undergone himself; insomuch that when Bishop, 33 Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Divines, Lawyers, Physicians and Statesmen, formerly his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils,
waited on him together for <hi>his blessing:</hi> He managed prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(as he was chosen into it unexpectedly and unanimously when an
hundred miles off) the Government and Provostship of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,

his Opinion; and being not humorsome, though precise, having
the severe strictness, though not the sower leaven of the <hi>Pharisees:</hi>
His gracious Master not so much honoring him, as he did the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and that age in the freedom of his Noble and unsought for
choice. The man being <hi>so</hi> exemplary in his carriage, that several
Recusants that could not go with him to Church, yet conversed
much with him, <hi>Because said they, they would go with him to Heaven:</hi>
So good a Master of his Family, that his House was a Church,
where Family-duties, (constant Prayers, Catechizing, reading
Scriptures, Expounding, godly Conference, speaking to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Psalms and Spiritual Hymns) were performed so regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and so constantly, that hundreds left their distant Habitations
to be near him, though all accommodations about him were so
much the dearer, as his Neighborhood was the more precious. It
was as great a happiness to be his Servant, as his Neighbour: <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
they say, is a Purgatory of Servants, but his House was a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for them, where their particular Calling helped forward
their general one, and the subjection to their Master occasioned
their freedom from sin; the condition of their persons breaking
off the slavery of their Souls, his service as well as Gods, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
(who might, he said often, have set him in the Stable, and his
Servant in the Pallace) being perfect freedom; neither did they
thrive in their Estates under him less than they did in their Souls,
many able men in that Country owing their plentiful Estates to
Gods blessing upon that <hi>Praying Family,</hi> as it was called, and <hi>his</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rule, that grace was thrifty and Christianity the best Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry;

King <hi>Charles,</hi> I. knew well the Import of that passage in <hi>Seneca,</hi>
(when with a design to heal the Distempers of those times, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
the grave Arch-bishop, and raised this moderate Bishop to
Supream Council.) <hi>Lib. Epist. 1. Ep. 11. Aliquis vir bonus nobis eligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus

<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the same moderate way did he guide the Clergy, both of
his acquaintance and Diocess, insisting much upon this sad obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that Jealousies and Animosities were easier raised than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed,
and that it was not so obvious a matter to retreat from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Engagements, as to Engage in them; that which hath in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing of Equity, being not to be disparaged by mannaging it
with undutifulness and pertinacy.</p>
            <p>Though his Complexion was <hi>melancholy,</hi> he loved not a <hi>morose</hi>
Religion; and though he was lean with study, he would chide
men that were so with Envy; his constitution indeed was weak,
but his Spirit vigorous, and good natur'd; he that had been the
support of moderate and sober Preachers, lived to see himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
by those he had countenanced: He that was so indulgent to
tender-consciences, was hardly suffered to enjoy his own: But
seeing pretences of Conscience end in unconscionable practices,
scruples turned into tumults, and Liberty prove Licentiousness,
heart-broken with the consequences of these sad premises, he died
1642. and was buried by a great Man of the other side, who brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that he had buried a Bishop, and was answered, That it was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
that he buried him in sure and certain hope of the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There need no more added to his Life, or written on his Grave,
than that this was the man, 1. That had been a constant Preacher,
and repented at his Death that he had not been a more constant
Catechist. 2. That interceded for Liberty of Conscience so long
for Non-conformists with the King, till he saw neither the King
nor himself could enjoy their own Consciences; that feared the
pretence of Religion would overthrow the reality of it, and that
the Divisions in his age, would breed Atheism in the next.</p>
            <p>How this Person in so great Esteem with that party, when he
was able to protect them, could do so little to suppress them, is
not to be expressed any other way than King <hi>Iames</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> upon occasion of a needless excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
taken by Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> at a passage in <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
himself; <hi>What trow ye make these men</hi> (said the King) <hi>so
angry with Ecclesiasticus: By my sal I think he was a Bishop, or else they
would never use him so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One that a great while followed him, but afterwards unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
set up a Gallery in Mr. <hi>C.</hi> Church (demonstrating that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
not the Preacher but Interest, for he was, he said, the same
man still, but they had not the same design; and Young men
were fittest to make use of to trouble or over-turn a State, as Old
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59370:87"/>
men were fittest to settle it) complained that once he personally
inveighed against him, whereunto a grave Gentleman, not so Great,
but more Honorable than he, returned: <hi>Truly, I thought it meant
me, for it touched my heart;</hi> Good men make <hi>Sermons,</hi> it is guilty
hearts make <hi>Invectives.</hi> When the Whirl-pool of the giddy times
drew in those that went with the stream, it could not swallow him
that kept above it; Long did he strive to bring off <hi>Stroud</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
his Hearers to him and reason. In vain did they strive with him
to bring him to them and Faction: as long as it was to any purpose,
he Preached to them their duty, and when that would not succeed,
he constantly avoided their sins; neither reading their Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor observing their Fasts, nor complying with their Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals;
Insomuch that a leading man that had been of his Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon a long Letter, he sent to him containing an account of
himself and his proceedings since the troublesome times, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself in the <hi>House</hi> to this purpose, <hi>That he could not tell what
they should do with the good old</hi> Puritans; <hi>whose misguided zeal should
do the Cause more harm, than all their Young Friends pains could do
it good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He preached for the King as long as he could, and when he could
not, by reason of infirmities and grief, he prayed for him as long as
he lived; keeping honest men, that were turned out of their own
Churches, to preach in his, until he went out of the world. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
to those that liked not that way, that in times of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> injoyned all Clergy-men that had
Churches, to offer their Desks and their Altars to them that had
none. As he preached not common-places of things to which he
wrested the Scripture, but went through the Scriptures (as <hi>Gen.</hi>
12, 13, 14, 15,<note n="*" place="margin">Whereof the <hi>16th</hi> is in Print.</note> 16, 17, 18, &amp;c. Chapters, the Plagues of <hi>Egypt</hi> in
<hi>Exodus,</hi> the 16. of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the Beatitudes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) drawing from
them genuinely Divine Truths; so advised those about him not to
follow men that set up notions of their own, and then serve some
Scriptures to make Affidavit for them; but those that opened the
Scriptures most skilfully, and deduced obvious, proper, and clear
conclusions out of them most faithfully. This Primitive Mans gifts,
were like the Primitive Christians goods, in common: Being above
others alone, and above himself in company; as <hi>Ambergreece</hi> is
sweet in its self, but incomparable when compounded. He was a
good Pastor himself (most of the eminent, both Christians and
Ministers in <hi>London,</hi> having profited by his Ministry) and not
jealous that his memory might be out-shined by a brighter succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor;
nor willing that his people should finde his worth by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness
of him that came after him, prayed for a better. His
Estate was more in <hi>blessing</hi> than in <hi>bulk,</hi> his richest Legacies were
his Precepts and his Example, and his best Monument the hearts of
his people, that will be his joy and crown of rejoycing in the day
of the Lord Jesus.</p>

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Sir JOHN SUCKLING.</head>
            <p>THE last Bishop we mentioned, was the last that
died with the honor of Voting in Parliament,
(that was not speechless before he departed.)
This Gentleman was the last Courtier that died
at Court: Dying as he was born a Courtier,
heir to Sir <hi>Iohn Suckling</hi> the Comptrollers estate,
but not his temper, being as aiery as the other
was solid; this grave Family, like heavy bodies <hi>evaporating</hi> into
more aieral parts towards its dissolution.</p>
            <p>There was an extraordinary Circumstance in his birth, that
raised an unusual expectation of his life, being born, as his Mother
reckoned, the beginning of the eleventh month. Now <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
<hi>Hypocrates</hi> allows, that the child born in the seventh
month, if well looked too, may live. <hi>Laurentius</hi> Professor of
<hi>Montpellier,</hi> in an admirable Treatise of Anatomy asserteth, that a
child of nine or ten months, which he calleth <hi>Terminus Inter me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
seldom miscarrieth. And <hi>Avicen,</hi> as he is quoted by <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
averreth, that a child born in the eleventh month, which he
expresseth, <hi>Terminus ultimus quando nihil additur ad perfectionem
partis, sed ad perfectionem roboris;</hi> is vigorous and Athletique. As
Sir <hi>Iohn Suckling,</hi> who did as <hi>Tiberius, vultu Principem (generosum)
praeferre,</hi> had a sprightly mind, that was an argument of a more
sprightly soul, which took in improvement faster than Tutors
could suggest; speaking Latine as early as <hi>Drusius</hi> his Son did He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
that is, at five years of age; and composing both in Latine
and English for Princes, as soon as <hi>Grotius</hi> did, that is, at nine years:
being so soon a man, that like<note n="a" place="margin">Who is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed created, as if he had been so.</note> 
               <hi>Adam,</hi> we would think he was
born so. The Arts were as closely united in him, as they are in
themselves, being competently seen in all of them, and yet emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
in many, being able to look in the whole circle without a
giddiness. He had tongues enough to renew that good understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among men, that was lost at <hi>Babel;</hi> desiring not only to live in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59370:88"/>
the world, but to understand it; and as great reason (which we
call <hi>Logick</hi>) to comprehend and discourse his notions, as he had
charms, which we call Rhetorick, to insinuate them; and what
was more, it was a question, whether he was more skilled in the
Philosophy of the two Globes, or in the History and Chronology
of all times, he shooting through any subject from one end of the
world to the other, with the same activity that spirits do, who do
not discourse, but see. His soul almost as large as that which some
call (under the first being) the soul of the world. He died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thirty, and was as old as the world, being able to treat of all
those things from books, which in twelve years time, that all the
wisdom of the world could insist on from experience in 5000
years; suffering himself to be no stranger to Cosmography, or
the account of the world in general, for his own satisfaction as a
Gentleman; to Choroghaphy, or the particularnature of each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of the world, for the service of his Country as an <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi>
to Topography, or an inspection into the circumstances of
each place, to qualifie him for noble employments and commands
as a Souldier. And all these sweetned with the softness of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that Musick and Charm of the world in words, and with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
that Poetry in sound. Fancy being his predominant faculty,
as the sanguine complexion was his controlling temperament, was
as restless and ubiquitary in him, as it is defined in its self; creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and tempering the Images and Ideas of things, with the same
ease that the things themselves were first made with. To lift too
high is no fault in a young Nagg, and to fancy too high was the
greatest defect of this young Gentleman. Nimbleness is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of fancy, and levity the bane of it; when it whisks up and
down to so many objects, that it throughly understands or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
none, unless hard and knotty studies, such as Philosophy
and Mathematicks, that fix and settle the soul.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Iohn Suckling,</hi> that was Knighted 1630. was Comptroller of the
Kings-house, and told this Gentleman, That he had no more to do
but to comptrol and govern himself, be being born before him. The
heighth of his parts, he acknowledged the effect of the discretion
of his Tutor (of whom he would seldom speak without this Note,
That it was one thing to be discreet, and another thing to be learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the management and use of a mans notions being hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with a heap and croud of them, as a midling state makes a
good Husband,) who humored his disposition as much as some Boys
are forced to humor their Masters; and made as many Rules of
his temper, as he found in his Grammar, being at once so ingenuous
and so plyable, that a frown was severe correction to him, and shame
whipped him more smartly than the Rod. He as solemnly honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Masters of all ingenuity, as Dr. <hi>Whitacre</hi> did his Tutor <hi>West;</hi>
when being <hi>Regius Professor,</hi> at his Tutors Commencing Doctor,
publickly gave him thanks before the University, for giving him
correction when his young Scholar. But had most regard to his
Father, for he best bowls at the mark of perfection, who besides
the aim of his own eye, is directed by his Father, who is to give
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59370:88"/>
him the ground; according to whose advice he travelled his own
Country well first, and then (in my Lord <hi>Burleighs</hi> method, who
seldom licensed a man to travel abroad, until he could give him a
good account of the remarkables at home) went over beyond Sea,
to see how mankind managed those principles in their <hi>practise,</hi> that
they had drawn up in their <hi>writings;</hi> and observe how they lived
and <hi>conversed,</hi> as well as how they <hi>thought;</hi> making an honorable
collection of the virtues of each Nation, without any tincture of
theirs, unless it were a little too much of the <hi>French</hi> Air, which
was indeed the fault of his complexion, rather than his person.
Though to correct it, he travelled from the softer dalliances of
that Nation, to the Wars and hardships, to knit as well as inlarge his
soul, and gain an Empire over his frailer self, with the same severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and discipline, that <hi>Gustavus</hi> was like to gain one over <hi>Europe.</hi>
With whom he run the hazard of three battels, five sieges, and as
many skirmishes, wherein he saw much design and contrivance, so
much conduct and manage, such activity and industry in six
months, as was not to be seen elsewhere in so many ages; there
being a concurrence of the excellencies, as well as of the men, of
all Nations. Insomuch, that though my Lord <hi>Goring</hi> would not
admit Sir <hi>Iohn Suckling</hi> into the Secret Councils they held in the
North, because he was too free and open-hearted, yet the King gave
him a Command there, because he was valiant and experienced.</p>
            <p>He raised a Troop of Horse, so richly accoutred, that it stood
him in 12000<hi>l.</hi> bestowing the Horses, Armes and Cloaths, upon each
person that was Listed under him; which puts me in mind of the
Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi>'s rich preparations against <hi>Swisse,</hi> of which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
it was said, <hi>The Enemy were not worth the Spurrs they wore.</hi>
And of his late Majesties report, upon the bravery of his Northern
Army, <hi>That the</hi> Scots <hi>would sight stoutly, if it were but for the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-<hi>mens
fine cloaths.</hi> And of another passage at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where
the King in some discourse of the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
in the first Expedition against the <hi>Scots,</hi> was pleased to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
himself to this purpose, <hi>That the Army was not in earnest, which
made him chuse such Commanders in Chief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed it became him better to sit among a Club of Wits, or
a Company of Scholars, than to appear in an Army; for though
he was active, he was soft and sweet withal; insomuch, that <hi>Selden</hi>
went away with the character of Deep and Learned, <hi>Hillingworth</hi>
was reckoned Rational and Solid, <hi>Digby</hi> Reaching and Vigorous
<hi>Sands</hi> and <hi>Townsend</hi> Smooth and Delicate, <hi>Vaughan</hi> and <hi>Porter</hi> Pious

            </p>
            <p>But his immature death by a Feavor, after a miscarriage in his
Majesties service, which he laid to heart, may be a warning to
young men of his quality and condition, whose youth is vigorous,
pleasures fresh, joynts nimble, bodies healthful, enjoyments great,
to look on his ghastly face, his hollow eyes, his mouldring body, his

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Dr. SAMUEL WARD.</head>
            <p>PASS now from a pretty Gentleman, that was all
wit and festivity (time and place making the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion)
to a Reverend person, that was all gravity
and judgment; and sad certainly the Cause of the
Faction, when the wittiest part of mankind laughed
at it, and the most judicious declined it, among whom, as none
more solid, so none more zealous than Dr. <hi>Samuel Ward,</hi> born at
<hi>Bishops-Middleham</hi> in the <hi>Bishoprick</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> being a Gentleman
of more ancientry than estate; bred first Scholar of <hi>Christs,</hi> then
Fellow of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> and afterwards Master of <hi>Sidney-Colledge</hi> in
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> Professor therein for above twenty years.
His character, which one, who knew him as well as most men, and
could judge of him as well as any man, doth bestow upon him,
is this:</p>

               <l>Antiquitatis crypta tu penetras frequens,</l>

               <l>With subtilty not light, slight, <hi>Vageas</hi> Hair,</l>

               <l>Antiquities hid depths thou oft dost sound,</l>

               <l>Distinctions threads none can so finely weave,</l>
               <l>Or reason wrench, thy knowledge to deceive.</l>

            </lg>
            <p>He turned with the times, as a Rock riseth with the Tide, and
for his uncomplying there with, was imprisoned in St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
He was counted a Puritane before these times, and Papish
in these times; and yet being alwayes the same, was a true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
at all times. How many men suffered in this one, 1. First, an
exact Linguist, by the same token, that when towards the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and last Translation of the Bible in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, the
Prayer of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> was committed to
his trust among Eight other <hi>Cambridge</hi> Men, when he was but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Arts of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge, the Revisers never reviewed his
performance, Dr. <hi>Smith,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> who were Intrusted
with the last Revises, saying, <hi>We have heard of second thoughts Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
the first, but thought shall Correct the twentieth:</hi> And not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
passages cost him fewer; for he would say had never been a
Scholar, but for a habit of exactness which he got under an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Master; and there is no other advantage in either going to
good Schools, or continue in Universities, than to keep the Soul
from being unravelled and loose, by a constant acting of thoughts,
and expressions to the Rule of accuracy taught in those Schools,
and practiced in those Universities; whence by never missing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
of thoughts, seldom failed of hitting things; and his steady
words seldom fell either beyond, besides, or short of his thoughts.</p>
            <p>2. A sound Scholar, and therefore by an Excellent Scholar as
well as good man, Bishop <hi>Iames Mountague,</hi> chosen Chaplain for
his Family, and Assistant for his Study.</p>
            <p>3. A discreet man, and upon that score by the same Bishop cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
by him his Notery; that is, his Eye and his Ear: For when Mr.
<hi>Thrash</hi> the violent <hi>Sabbatarian</hi> came to be Ordained, and it was a
Question whether he had ever sucked of the Breast of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,
or brought up by hand in some petty School, Mr. <hi>Ward</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him, as altogether insufficient; however afterwards he crept
into Christian Orders to broach Judaizing Doctrines by some rash
hands, which might wish with <hi>Martianus,</hi> a Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
who made <hi>Sabbatius</hi> a Jew, and turbulent man Priest, they had
been laid on Thorns and Briars, than on such a mans head; upon
a Certificate, which was then matter of Courtesie, and not matter
of Conscience, the good Bishop trusting to his own Eye for the
sufficiency, and to other mens hands for the carriage of the Man;
an error in the first concoction, is seldom corrected in the second,
an unworthy, and therefore turbulent man, (for worthless men

was great, especially in one respect, as King <hi>Iames</hi> would say,
that he would set down no idle or impertinent word.</p>

as he governed by his place; more depending upon him there
and abroad as a Benefactor, than did as a Governor. Being a great
recommender as well as incourager of Worth, he used to say that
he knew nothing that Church and State suffered more by, than the
want of a due knowledg of those Worthy men that were peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enabled and designed to serve both: And, as another Argument
of his goodness, he went alwayes along with the moderate in the
censures of <hi>Preachers</hi> in the University, <hi>practices</hi> in the Courts that
were under his Jurisdiction: And in Opinions in the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereof he was a Member, much pleased with a modest soft
way, that might win the persons and smoother their errors, being
much pleased with his Friend Mr. <hi>Dods</hi> saying, that men should use
soft words, and hard Arguments.</p>
            <p>And this so much known to others, (though so little observed
by him, this meek and slow speeched <hi>Moses</hi> his face shining to all
men but himself) that it procured six or 7000 <hi>l.</hi> Improvement in
his time to the Colledge, besides the Building of that Chappel
which he Dedicated by his own burial, being the first that was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

compliance might finde expedients to prevent, if not the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
yet the overturning of Church and State; so the wary
Merchants throws somethings over-board to save the Ship, which
escapes not by struggling with the storm, but by yielding to it.
And inserted one of their Assembly, whither he came not, being
not called by the King (one of the flowers of whose Crown it is
to call Assemblies, as appears by Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> his Learned Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

chosen by the Clergy; and because there was a legal Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in being, that superseded this Illegal Assembly wherein it was
in vain for few Oxthodox men to appear, being overvoted by
their numerous Antagonists.</p>
            <p>But since he could not serve the King and Church with his
parts, he did with his Interest, chearfully sending the Colledge
Plate to the King, and zealously (when the Committee of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Association was setled there) protesting against any Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
to the Parliament, as against true Religion and a good

and as high winds bring some men to sleep, so these
storms brought this good Doctor to rest, whose dying words, (as
if the cause of his Martyrdom had been Ingraven on his heart)
breathed up with his Divine Soul, <hi>Now God bless the King,</hi> though

himself, not the exact time he was beheaded on, but yet the very
minute he suffered; for though <hi>Charles</hi> was Martyred 1648. the

            <div type="subpart">
               <head>Upon the various Events of the VVar, Victories and Defeats.</head>
               <p>THe various successes of this unhappy War have at least afforded the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of good meditations: Sometimes God was pleased to try me with Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by worsting my Enemies, that I might know how with moderation and
thanks to own him and his power, who is the only true Lord of hosts; able when
he pleases to repress the confidence of those who fought against me with so great
advantages for power and number.</p>
               <p>From small beginnings on my part, he let me see, that I was not wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
by my Peoples love, or his protection. Other times God was pleased to
exercise my Patience, and teach me not to trust in the arme of flesh, but the
living God.</p>
               <p>My sins sometimes prevailed against the Iustice of my cause; and those that
were with me wanted not matter and occasion for his just chastisement both of
them and me: Nor were my Enemies less punished by that prosperity, which
hardned them to continue that injustice by open hostility, which was begun by
riotous and un-Parliamentary Tumults.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt but personal and private sins may oft-times over-ballance
the justice of publick engagements; Nor doth God account every gallant Man
(in the Worlds esteem) a fit instrument to assert in the way of War, a righteous
cause; The more men are prone to arrogate to their own skill, valour, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59370:98"/>
strength, the lesse doth God ordinarily work by them for his own glory.</p>
               <p>I am sure the event or success can never state the justice of any cause, nor
place of mens Consciences, nor the eternal fate of their Souls.</p>
               <p>Those with me had (I think) clearly and undoubtedly, for their justification
the Word of God, and the Laws of the Land, together with their own Oaths,
all requiring obedience to my just commands; but to none other under Heaven
without me, or against me, in the point of raising Arms.</p>
               <p>Those on the other side are forced to fly to the shifts of their pretended fear,
and wild Fundamentalls of State (as they call them) which actually overthrow
the present Fabrick both of Church and State; being such imaginary Reasons
for self-defence, as are most impertinent for those men to allege; who being
my Subjects, were manifestly the first assaulter of me and the Laws, first by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppressed
Tumults, after by listed Forces.</p>
               <p>The same Allegations they use, will fit any Faction, that hath but power
and confidence enough, to second with the sword, all their demands against
the present Laws and Governours; which can never be such, as some side or
other will not find fault with, so as to urge what they call a Reformation of them,
to a Rebellion against them: some parasitick Preachers have dared to call those
Martyrs, who dyed fighting against me, the Laws, their Oaths, and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion established.</p>
               <p>But sober Christians know, That glorious Title can with truth be applyed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to those, who sincerely preferred Gods truth, and their duty, in all these
particulars, before their lives, and all that was dear to them in this World;
who, having no advantagious designes, by any innovation, were religiously sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of those tyes to God, the Church, and my self, which lay upon their souls,
both for obedience, and just assistance.</p>
               <p>God could, and I doubt not but he did, through his mercy, crown many of
them with eternal life, whose were lost in so just a cause; the destruction of their
bodies being sanctified as a means to save their souls.</p>
               <p>Their wounds, and temporal ruine, serving as a gracious opportunity for
their eternal health and happiness; while the evident approach of death,
through Gods grace, effectually disposing their hearts to such humility, faith,
and repentance, which, together with the rectitude of their present engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
would fully prepare them for a better life, than that which their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
brutish and disloyal fierceness could deprive them of, or without repentance
hope to enjoy.</p>
               <p>They have often indeed had the better against my side in the field, but never,
I believe, at the barr of Gods tribunal, or their own Consciences, where they
are more afraid to encounter those many pregnant Reasons, both from Law,
Allegiance, and all true Christian grounds, which conflict with, and accuse
them in their own thoughts; than they oft were, in a desperate bravery, to fight
against those forces, which sometimes God gave me.</p>
               <p>Whose condition, conquered and dying, I make no question, but is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
more to be chosen, by a sober man (that duly values his duty, his soul, and
eternity, beyond the enjoyments of this present life) than the most triumphant
glory, wherein their and mine enemies supervive; who can hardly avoid to
be daily tormented, by that horrid guilt, wherewith their suspicious, or now
convicted Consciences, do pursue them; especially since they, and all the World
have seen, how false and un-intended those pretensions were, which they first
set forth, as the only plausible (though not justifiable) grounds of raising a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59370:98"/>
War, and continuing it thus long, against me, and the Laws established;
in whose safety and preservation, all honest men think the welfare of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
doth consist.</p>
               <p>For and with all which, it is farr more honourable and comfortable to suffer,
than to prosper in their ruine and subversion.</p>
               <p>I have often prayed, that all on my side, might joyn true piety with the sence
of their loyalty: and be as faithful to God, and their own souls, as they were to
me; that the defects of one might blast the endeavours of the other.</p>
               <p>Yet cannot think, that any shews or truth of piety, on the other side, were
sufficient to dispence with, or expiate the defects of their Duty and Loyalty to
me, which have so pregnant convictions on mens Consciences, that even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner
men are moved, by the sense of them, to venture their lives for me.</p>
               <p>I never had any Victory, which was without my sorrow, because it was on
mine own subjects who, like <hi>Absalom,</hi> dyed, many of them, in their sins;
And yet I never suffered any Defeat, which made the despair of Gods mercy
and defence.</p>
               <p>I never desired such Victories, as might serve to conquer, but only restore
the Laws and Liberties of my People, which I saw were extremely oppressed;
together with my Rights, by those men, who were impatient of any just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.</p>
               <p>When Providence gave me, or denyed me Victory, my desire was, neither to
boast of my power, nor to charge God foolishly, who I believed at last would make all
things to work together for my good.</p>
               <p>I wished no greater advantages by the War, than to bring my Enemies to
moderation, and my friends to peace.</p>
               <p>I was afraid of the temptation of an absolute Conquest, and prayed for vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
over others, then over my self; when the first was denyed, the second
was granted me, which God saw best for me.</p>
               <p>The different events were but the method of Divine Iustice, by contrary
Winds to winow us, that, by punishing our sins he might purge them from us,
and by deserting peace, he might prepare us more to prize, and better to use
so great a blessing.</p>
               <p>My often Messages for peace shewed, That I delighted not in War, as my
former concessions sufficiently testified, how willing I would have prevented is,
and my total unpreparedness for it, how little I intended it.</p>
               <p>The Conscience of my Innocency forbad me to fear a War; but the Love of
my Kingdoms commanded me (if possible) to avoid it.</p>
               <p>I am guilty of this War of nothing but this, That I gave such advantages to
some men by confirming their power, which knew not to use with that modesty,
and gratitude, which became their Loyalty, and my confidence.</p>
               <p>Had I yielded less, I had been opposed less; had I denyed more, I had
been more obeyed.</p>
               <p>'Tis now too late to review the occasions of War; I wish only a happy conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of so unhappy beginnings: the inevitable fate of our sins was (no doubt)
such, as would no longer suffer the Divine Iustice to be quiet, we having
conquered his patience, are condemned by mutual conquerings to destroy one
another: for the most prosperous successes on either side impair the welfare of
the whole.</p>
               <p>Those Victories are still miserable, that leave our sins unsubdued, flushing
our pride, and animating to continue injuries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:59370:99"/>
Peace it self is not desirable, till Repentance have prepared us for it.</p>
               <p>When we fight more against our selves, and less against God, we shall cease
fighting against one another: I pray God these may all meet in our hearts, and so
dispose us to a happy conclusion of these civil Wars, that I may know better to obey
God and Govern my People; and they may learn better to obey both God and me:
nor do I desire any man should be further subject to me, than all of us may be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

refused it, saying, <hi>If I should get away, they would cut you in pieces:</hi> a

<hi>not to make my self a better Christian than I am, I think I should not so easily

veneration, yet serve only to the benefit of the World. It is the excellency of
our bodies to be instruments, whereby happiness is delivered unto the Nations.
Pardon me Sir, this is not to instruct, (for I know I speak to one of a more
clear and quick sight than my self) but I speak this, because God hath been
pleased to grant me a happy Victory over some of those rebellious Pyrates, that
have so long molested that peaceful Trade of <hi>Europe;</hi> and have presented fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
occasion to root out the Generation of those, who have been so pernicious
to the good of our Nations: I mean, since it hath pleased God to be so auspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to our beginnings in the conquest of <hi>Salla,</hi> that we might joyn and proceed,
in hope of like success, in the War against <hi>Tunis, Algier,</hi> and other places,
(Dens and Receptacles for the humane Villanies of those who abhorr rule and
government) herein whilst we interrupt the corruption of maglinant spirits
of the World, we shall glorifie the great God, and perform a duty that
will shine as glorious as the Sun and Moon, which all the Earth may see and
reverence; A work that shall ascend as sweet as the perfume of the most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
odours, in the Nostrils of the Lord; A work happy and gratefull to men;
A work whose memory shall be reverenced so long as there shall be any that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to hear the actions of Heroick and magnanimous spirits, that shall last as
long as there be any remaining amongst men that love and honour the piety and
vertue of noble minds. This action I willingly present to you, whose piety and
vertues equal the greatness of your power. That we who are the Servants to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59370:100"/>
the great and mighty God, may hand in hand triumph in the glory which this
action presents unto us. Now because the Islands which you govern have been
very famous for the unconquered strength of their shipping, I have sent this my
trusty Servant and Embassadour, to know whether in your Princely Wisdom you
shall think fit to assist me with such forces by Sea, as shall be answerable to those
I provide by Land, which if you please to grant, I doubt not but the Lord of
Hosts will protect and assist those that fight in so glorious a cause. Nor ought
you to think this strange, that I who much reverence the peace and accord of
Nations, should exhort to a War: Your great Prophet Christ Iesus was the
Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as well as the Lord and giver of Peace, must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
appear with the terrour of his Sword, and wading through Seas of blood,
must arrive to tranquillity. This made <hi>James</hi> your Father, of glorious memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
so happily renowned amongst all Nations. It was the noble fame of your
Princely vertues, which resounds to the utmost corners of the Earth, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
me to invite you to partake of that blessing, wherein I boast my self most
happy. I wish God may heap riches of his blessings on you, increase your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with your daies, and hereafter perpetuate the greatness of your name in all
Ages.</p>

either by the best or worst accident that could happen.</p>
               <p>A Devotion to which he made his pleasure (witness his constant cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for Prayers before Hunting, though before day) and his business,
witness his ordering of Prayers to be made to God, before he Ingaged
the Rebels at <hi>Brentford</hi> (valuing his duty before his safety) whereupon
his private Prayers in restraint, were admired by his Enemies, and his
constant attendance on, and hast to Divine Service whereever he was, by
his friends. At Bishop <hi>Lauds</hi> request he came to Church in the beginning
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59370:100"/>
of Divine Service to prevent any interuption might happen in the publick
Devotion, and of his own accord he continued to the end to avoid all
Contempt of it. Where his eye was in the beginning of Sermon, there it
was in the end; his attendance edifying as much <hi>by the Example,</hi> as the
Preacher did by <hi>his Doctrine:</hi> The established way of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> was <hi>his</hi> profession, not so much by Education, as by Choice,
not as a profession he <hi>liked,</hi> but <hi>understood</hi> the best in the world: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more usuall than to defame him and others for Inclination to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
(for to the great shame of our Profession, and honour of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
all the Reason, Order, Discipline, Laws and Religion that was in
the world, was then reckoned Popish) and yet nothing rendred him a
more conspicuous Protestant than the late Rebellion, wherein besides
his Constancy in <hi>Spain</hi> against the temptations of that Court, the solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations
of the Pope, and the restless Importunities of Priests and Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
he added these Arguments of his sincerity in Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> That
in his private Indearments to the Queen when he had most need of her
assistance, he saith Religion was the only thing in difference between
<hi>them;</hi> And in his Legacy to his Children, he bequeatheth them not
only Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> Sermons, and Mr. <hi>Hookers</hi> Policy that might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
them in the Doctrine and Discipline of our Church, but Arch-bishop
<hi>Lauds</hi> book against <hi>Fisher</hi> the greatest and strongest Argument
and Antidote against the Romists, insomuch that if the faction had not
overthrown his Government, the Papists as appears by <hi>Habernefields</hi>
discovery had ruined his Person; as afterwards many of them obstructed
his Restauration, and his Sons, for no other reason, but that he was
Heir of his Fathers Faith, as well as his Throne.</p>
               <p>Religion had the whole power of his soul, as he should have had of
his subjects, whom he desired no further subject to him, than he was
to God. How tender his Conscience! that was resolved (as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
the most Reverend Father in God, <hi>G.</hi> now Arch-bishop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> then his Chaplain, if ever he saw him in prosperity, to
put him in mind of it) to do publick Pennance, for consenting to the
E. of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s death (a deep sence of which action went with him to
his grave) and to the injuries done the Church in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
How careful his heart! in that, when the Commissioners at the Isle
of <hi>Wight,</hi> urged him to allow the lesser Catechism of the Assembly,
(that being, they said, but a small matter) he said, <hi>Though it seem
to you a small matter, yet I had rather part with the choicest flower in my
Crown, than permit your Children to be corrupted in the least point of their
Religion.</hi> How great his Integrity! when the Commissioners urged the
abolishing of Episcopacy in <hi>England,</hi> because he had consented to the
abolishing of it in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and it was replyed, That in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the
Act made to that purpose, in the minority of King <hi>Iames,</hi> was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed;
and that his consenting to that, was only leaving them <hi>where
the Law left them:</hi> He said, <hi>That Reply was true, but it was not all, for the
truth is</hi> (they are his own words) <hi>and tell them so the next time they urge
that, When I did that in</hi> Scotland, <hi>I sinned against my Conscience, and I
have often repented of it, and I hope God hath forgiven me that great sin; and
by Gods grace, for no consideration in the World, will I do so again.</hi> Neither
was he thus exceedingly religious as a man only, but as a King: Neither
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59370:101"/>
was Religion only his private Devotion, but his publick Government,
wherein he aimed at, 1. The peace of the Church, (wherein those
parts and abilities that he saw lost in malice and dissentions, might be
very useful to the promoting of Religion and Godliness) And 2. the
honour, maintenance and splendour of the Church: For the first of
which, he consulted sufficiently, in his favours to Arch-bishop <hi>Laud,</hi>
Bishop <hi>Neile,</hi> Bishop <hi>Iuxon.</hi> For the second, by his endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Patrimony of the Church in <hi>England, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi>
where his religious intentions gave occasion to their rebellion, who,
rather than they would part with their private sacrileges, resolved on
the publick ruine. And for the third, by his great charge in the repair
of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and other places. To say nothing of his godly resolution
to buy all Lands and Tythes, alienated from the Church, with his own
Estate, by such degrees as his other expences would give him leave;
the greatest testimonies of a design to make Religion as universal of his
Empire, next those from his own mouth.</p>

To all those who profess the true Reformed Protestant Religion, of what Nation,
condition and degree soever they be, to whom this present Declaration shall
come, Greeting. Whereas We are given to understand, that many false ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and scandalous Letters, are spread up and down amongst the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Churches in foreign parts, by the politick, or rather the pernicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
of some ill affected persons, that We have an inclination to recede from
that Orthodox Religion, which We were born, baptized, and bred in; and
which We have firmly professed and practised through the whole course of Our
Life to this moment: And that We intend to give way to the introduction and
publick exercise of Popery again in Our Dominions: Which conjecture, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59370:101"/>
most detestable calumny, being grounded upon no imaginable, foundation,
hath raised these horrid Tumults, and more than Barbarous Wars throughout
these flourishing Islands, under a pretext of a kind of Reformation, which would
not prove only incongruous, but incompatible with the Fundamentall Laws
and Government of this our Kingdom. We desire that the whole Christian
World should take notice, and rest assured, that we never entertained in our
imagination the least thought to attempt such a thing, or to depart a jot from
that Holy Religion; which when we received the Crown and Scepter of this
Kingdome, we took a most Solemn Sacramentall Oath to Profess and Protect.
Nor doth our most constant Practice, and daily visible Presence in the Exercise
of this sole Religion, with so many asseverations in the head of our Armies,
and in the publick attestation of our Lords, with the circumspection used in
the education of our Royall Offspring, besides divers other undeniable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
only demonstrate this, but also that happy Alliance of Marriage we
Contracted between our eldest Daughter, and the Illustrious Prince of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
most clearly confirmes the realty of Our intentions herein; by which
Nuptial engagement it appears further, that Our endeavours are not only to
make a bare profession thereof in Our own Dominions, but to enlarge and coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
it abroad, as much as lyeth in Our power. This most holy Religion,
with the Hierarchy and Liturgy thereof, We solemnly protest, that by the help
of Almighty God, We will endeavour, to Our utmost power, and last period of
Our life, to keep entire and immoveable; and will be careful, according to Our
duty to Heaven, and the tenour of the aforesaid most saCRed Oath at Our
Coronation, that all Our Ecclesiasticks, in their several Stations and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bencies,

               <p>I desire to govern by the known Laws of the Land, and that the liberty and
propriety of the Subject may be by them preserved, with the same care as mine

power, and particularly to observe inviolably the Laws consented unto by me this

am now driven unto, beget any violation of these, I hope it shall be imputed by
God and man to the Authors of this War, and not to me, who have so earnestly
laboured for the peace of this Kingdom. When I willingly fail in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59370:103"/>
of his Majesty, who did them no more harm than to disarm,
and engage them by oath to do no harm to their fellow Subjects.
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth asked one that had been hired to kill him,
when he was discovered, <hi>why should he kill him who never had done
him or his any harm?</hi> And the man answered, <hi>Because of his Religion.
Why look</hi> (said the King) <hi>thy Religion doth teach thee to murther me,
who never did thee any harm; and my Religion teacheth me to pardon
thee, who wouldst thus have murthered me.</hi> If a man should have ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
these poor thousands thus deserted by their Commanders, why
do you fight against so gracious a Soveraign, that was so far from
wronging you while you behaved your selves like good Subjects,
that he cannot punish you now you are Traitors? They would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<hi>It is for Religion;</hi> and all the world may judge between their
Religion, who would needs fight their Leige Soveraign, when he
would do them more good than they were willing to receive; and
his who pardoned them when they had done all they could against
him. Hitherto in other places he conquered them, and here him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and satisfied the world that it must needs be nothing but
peace, that he aimed at by his Treaties; when it was nothing but
peace, that he designed by his Victories. He using this success to
no other end than as earnestly to intreat them himself, and all the
Noblemen and Gentlemen in his Army as earnestly to accept of
peace, as if he had been conquered, he should have begged it.
Willing he was to settle peace at home, and yet scorned to accept
of unhandsom terms from abroad. All the world saw his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
inclination to a peace, and the Rebels implacable resolution
to go on with the war. The Conspirators had need of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> upon the refusal of his Majesties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
were ashamed of them; whence, when they were not
likely to be assisted from abroad, they beg, but upon hard conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
a peace at home. Conditions that his Majesty would not yield
to in his lowest condition, though he would have done any thing
but sin, to obtain peace at the highest. A peace that they must have
yielded to, had not they new-modelled their design and their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
by a self-denying Ordinance, cashiering all Officers that retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any degree of sobriety; and a new model, taking in all Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to enlarge and make desperate their party.</p>
               <p>Sad is the news the Rebels hear from all parts of <hi>England,</hi> but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good that which his Majesty heard from <hi>Scotland;</hi> where his
friends increased as much as theirs decreased here, such moderate
men as <hi>Essex,</hi> the<note n="a" place="margin">Who had an honest design to undo the whole Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</note> Earl of <hi>Manchester,</hi> and <hi>Denbigh</hi> laying down
their Commissions, when they saw such taking Commission as had
laid down all thoughts of peace. They were first entertained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a war could not be begun without the countenance of sober
men, but afterwards they were laid aside by the politick self-denial
Ordinance, because the war would be no longer continued by such.</p>
               <p>In a word, to such success had the conduct and magnanimity of his Majesty arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that 1645. he writes to the Queen, <hi>That he might without being too sanguine affirm,
that since the Rebellion his affairs were never in so hopeful a way.</hi> Not to mention his
great personal valour at <hi>Naseby,</hi> a valour and conduct that deserved success though
at last it wanted it, the King having other virtues that were to be rendred glorious
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59370:103"/>
by sufferings, as this had been by actions; and therefore he was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,
not Overcome; Sold, and not Conquered. And yet as his
great Spirit at his best fortune endeavoured an honourable Peace, so at
his worse he would not admit of a dishonourable one; for measuring
his Propositions not by the event of affairs, but by his own Conscience,
he stands to the same terms when Defeated, as he did when Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
never betraying his Peoples Liberties to those Usurpers in hope of
a Peace, in the defence of which he thought fit to undertake a war.
I know not which is most magnanimous, that he should with so much
hazard venture his Person so resolutely, and manage his cause against
their Politicians and Divines so bravely, or that he should with so
much honour correspond with the Parliament in his own single Person,
answering the arguments of the one, and the proud messages of the
other, and gaining that Conquest by his Pen, that he could not by his
Sword: He is contented to discharge all his Garrisons and Armies,
and that excellent Association in the VVest, formed by the Prince, with
the assistance of Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> &amp;c. being upon a design of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
his Enemies, as he did <hi>Henderson,</hi> &amp;c. and all that had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
to know him by his own Person, and being likely to do more by
a Peace, than either others, or indeed he himself could do by a war,
cutting those more than Gordian knots with the sharpness of his own
single reason, that could not be by the edge of all <hi>Englands</hi> Sword;
when the <hi>Scots</hi> after many debates with the <hi>English,</hi> had not the courage
to stand to their Promise, Oath, and Honour, in keeping the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
he owned a magnanimity whereby he kept Free, even when
delivered, his own Conscience; they could not be true to duty, when
tempted with 800000 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. nor he unworthy to his trust, though tempted
with three Kingdoms: And now that King that with his bare presence
had raised an Army in the beginning of the war, that gave a Cheque
to Rebellion four years now by his own Conduct (when he had not
one (as they phrased it) <hi>Evill</hi> Counsellor about him) and gallant
Sufferings, he raised the City, and all the Kingdom, to reduce the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
to reason, there being in his lowest condition 54000 Men (and
most of them such as had Engaged against him) up in his defence in
<hi>Scotland, Wales, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and things were brought to that
pass, by his excellent managery, that the very Army that overcam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him, did not think themselves safe, but under his Protection, and
therefore they ventured their Masters displeasure, to gain the Kings
Person, each Party thinking its self more or less considerable, as they
wanted or injoyed him. The Parliament, as they call it, Voting his
Concessions Satisfactory, on the one hand, and the Army declaring
their Propositions to the King unreasonable: They that durst fight
his Armies, yet so farr Reverenced his Person, that they did that to
him in his lowest condition, that is usually done to Princes in their
highest, and that is <hi>Flatter</hi> him, the one saying that he had done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and the other that he had done too much. What a brave sight
it was to see him able to manage his greatest misfortunes with Honour,
and his Enemies their greatest Victories with Confusions, the Army
against the Houses, the Commons against the Lords, yea one part
against another, the City for and against both, the Common Souldiers
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59370:104"/>
by a new way of Agitation, whereby they could spread and manage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
treason, sedition, intelligence, plot and design throughout the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in a moment, by two or three of the most active, or desperate, in a
Company or Regiment: And he all the while above all these enjoying
the calm that sits in the Upper Region; neither yielding to his Enemies
nor his misfortues; insomuch that when they were so barbarous as to let
him want Linnen, he said, <hi>They had done so for two months, but he would
not afford them the pleasure of knowing that he wanted.</hi> Yea, and when
some of them were too sawcy with him in private, he could, though
their Prisoner, civillize them with his <hi>look,</hi> and <hi>Cane.</hi> In a word, the
Kings fortitude appeared as eminent as his other vertures (though ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clypsed,
as the Divine power is to some mens apprehensions, by his
mercy) in that he could say to the last, that he should never think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
weakned, while he enjoyed the use of his reason, and while God
supplied with inward resolutions what he denied him in outward
strength, by which resolution he meant not a morosity to deny what is
fit to be granted, but a spirit not to grant what Religion and Justice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</p>
               <p>I shall never think my self (they are his own Royal expressions) less

                  <note n="X" place="margin">What great things the King granted, and did for the Nation, during the 23 years that he reigned.</note> A Prince thus excellent in himself, and choice in his Council,
made up of persons eminent for their services <hi>for</hi> or <hi>against</hi> him: for
parts and abilities he equally valued in his enemies and in his friends,
and when he saw hopefull, and accomplish'd persons lavishing their
worth upon a faction, and a private interest; if they were not of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate

since that they could not saefly enjoy.</p>
               <p>That Prince, who besides the great examples he gave them, and
the great intercessions and services he did for them, begun his Reign
with the highest Act of Grace that he could, or any King did in the
World. I mean the granting of the Petition of Right, wherein he secured
his Peoples estates from Taxes that are not given in Parliament, and
their Lives, Liberties, and Estates, from all Proceedings not agreeable
to Law. A King that permitted his chief favourite and Counsellor,
the D. of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whose greatest fault was his Majesties favour;
to satisfie the Kingdom, both in Parliament and Star-chamber, in the
way of a publick Process. And gave up <hi>Mainwaring</hi> and <hi>Sibthorpe,</hi> both
(as I take it) his Chaplains, to answer for themselves in Parliament,
saying, <hi>He that will preach more than he can prove, Let him suffer:</hi> Yea
and was contented to hold some part of his Revenue, as Tunnage,
Poundage, &amp;c. which was derived to him from his Ancestors by Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
by gift from the Parliament. A Prince that pardoned and
preferred all his Enemies; that though accountable to none but God,

Order, the rights and maintenance of the Church, and the
honour of Churchmen, and in the State no more than the necessary
defence of the Kingdom from dangers abroad, and disorders at home,
which he maintained several years at his own charge; that by destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
several of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Herring Busses, and forcing the rest, with all
<hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants, to trade only by permission in the Narrow Seas, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a brave trade to the <hi>English</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>A King that took so much pains to oblige his Loving Subjects, going
twice in person as far as <hi>Scotland</hi> (though against the inclination of most
of his Counsellours, who looked upon the <hi>Scotch</hi> Faction, as a sort of
people, that under the pretence of a specious way of plain speaking
and dealing, concealed the greatest animosities and reaches) and twice
with an Army, rather to pacifie than overthrow the Rebels; treating
with them as a Father of his Country, when, in all probability, he
might have ruined them, if he had proceeded against them 1639. and
1640. as a King, and not, in imitation of the Divine Majesty, wrapped up
the dreadful power he carried then with him, in gracious condescentions
of mercy. A King, that of 346. Libellers, seditious Writers, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
Conspirators against his Crown, Dignity and Authority in
Church and State, put none to death; and punished but five through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his whole Reign.</p>
               <p>A King, in whose Reign there were such good Canons made, that
Judge <hi>Crooke,</hi> a Dissenter about Ship-money, blessed God when he
read them, that he lived to see such Canons made for the Church. A
King, that publickly declared, <hi>That he was rosolved to put himself freely
upon the love and affections of his subjects.</hi> One of the two Propositions he
made the Parliament 1640. being to desire them to propose their
grievances, wherein he promised them to concurr so heartily and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

have been, and are, to make this a glorious and flourishing Kingdom.</hi> And
to shew his good inclination to Religion, married his eldest Daughter
to an ordinary Protestant Prince: And to the welfare of the Kingdom,
he tyed himself to a Triennial Parliament, allowing this Parliament
<hi>to sit as long as they thought fit,</hi> and for a time to order the Militia; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
them to set down, what they thought necessary for him to

               </p>
               <p>Yea, as if this had not been enough, <hi>A King</hi> that suffered all his
Ministers of State to clear their innocency before publick Judicatures, in
the face of the World; and though accountable only to him for their
actions, yet ready to appeal to their very accusers themselves for their
Integrity; And yet not so willing to remit his friends to Justice, as his

Amnesty offered <hi>to,</hi> and accepted <hi>by</hi> them; after it, an Amnesty that they
might have securely trusted to, when he bestowed upon them not only
their lives, but likewise for some years all the power over the Militia of
the Kingdom to make good that pardon by which they held their lives:
neither had they only the Sword in their hands to <hi>defend,</hi> but all places
of trust, authority, and Judicature to secure and inrich themselves; the
King allowing them for so long a time, not only to enjoy all their own
places, but to dispose of all others; adding this favour too, that they
who grudged him a power to raise money to supply his occasions,
should have what power they pleased to raise money to satisfie their
own demands; and when he had confirmed the pardon of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in general, he offered the renovation of all Charters, and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
Privileges in particular, denying nothing that their ambition or
covetousness could desire, or his Conscience grant; being willing to
be no King himself, that his people might be happy Subjects; and to
accept of a titular Kingdom, on condition they had a peaceable one.
In Religion its self (wherein he denyed most, because he had less

liberty to himself and his followers; desiring no more than to enjoy that
freedom as a Soveraign, that they claimed as Subjects. Any thing he
yielded they should take from his Clergy, but what God gave them;

a war, when they would not endure a peace; and when they
had voted his Concessions sufficient grounds to proceed on to the
settlement of the kingdom, and yet ruined it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> that they declared against for raising a Guard at <hi>York, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi>
to secure himself, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they raised at Army at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
to Take, Imprison, and Murther him. That must be author of
all the bloud shed in the three Nations, after all his Concessions,
Messages, Declarations, Treaties, and Overtures, a sea and mercy
to 20000 Rebels to stanch it. And when all the bloud that was
spilt before his death, was to rob him of his life and government,
as appears by the five times more bloud that was spilt after his
death, to make good that robbery and murther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He</hi> that saw a war begun to remove his evil Council, and ended
in the taking off his Head; and that was said to begin a war, when
his first was dated the very day his enemies army was mustered; the
Faction having ordered an army to take <hi>him,</hi> before he thought of
one to save <hi>himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that Prince, that saw a people in the Name of God, lay
hands on his anointed, Preachers of the Gospel of peace trumpet
it for war; Religion made an argument against obedience, and the
Holy Spirit urged against peace and love, and the Text, <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
the King, the Ordinance of God, resisteth to his own damnation,</hi>
understood thus: He that resisteth not shall be Sequestred; and
<hi>(that) Curse ye</hi> Meroz, <hi>that came not to help the Lord against the
Mighty,</hi> (thus) <hi>Curse ye all English-men, that help not the Rebellious
against Gods Anointed:</hi> And Fear God, Honor the King; into fear
the Lord, and kill the King: and that where the word of a King
there is power, understood thus: The King shall not have a <hi>Negative
Voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A King that saw himself Engaged, Imprisoned, and Impeached
for the peoples sake, in spight of the peoples teeth, both those that
were at first against him, being undeceived, and those that were
always for him, indeed the whole Nations of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>
venturing their lives to rescue the King, when he was imprisoned
in their name, accused for shedding their bloud, when they were
killed by their fellow Subjects, because they desired to save his.</p>
               <p>A King that saw a Parliament accuse him of Breach of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
when he came but to demand five men suspected for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Intelligence with a Forraign Nation, and yet the same Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
suffer tamely its own Army to pull out by the ears more than
half of the best Members, that remained there for promoting the
peace of their, and Vote it the Priviledge of the Subjects, to make
tumults from all parts of the kingdom about <hi>Westminster,</hi> to fright
King and Bishops from the Parliament, and a Breach of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
for the same people in throngs there from as many parts
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59370:106"/>
of the kingdom, to Petition the return of the one and the other.
He from whom they extorted so much liberty in pretence for the
Subject, had neither liberty for himself, being confined to hard
Prisons, and harder Limitations, and Propositions, nor for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
who had they injoyed their own freedom, had never endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his captivity.</p>
               <p>He that could not deny the kingdom a Free-Parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of above an hundred Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and
five hundred Commons, lived to see that very Parliament Exclude
all its Lords, and Reduce the five hundred Commons to thirty; who
in the name of the people, when there was not one in five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of them but would have ventured his life against it, threaten
his life, whom they had sworn when they entred that House, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend;
prepare to judge him, who called them there to consult
with them; talk as if they would put a period to his days, who
gave them their being (little dreaming that while they aimed at
his
Royal Neck, they cut off their own: for what is a Parliament
called to advise with the King, if there be no King to advise
with?)</p>
               <p>He must be tried in whose name all others are tried, by that Law
himself hath made, by those people that had sworn, protested, and
covenanted, with hands lift up to the most high God in publick,
and pawned their souls and all that they had, privately to restore
him, whose only fault was, that he went from that Parliament that
murdered him, when he returned to them. Riddles! <hi>Cromwell,
Whaley, Ireton, &amp;c.</hi> and the Army, weep and grieve (but the <hi>Hiena</hi>
weeps when it intends to devour) at the hard conditions the
Houses put upon him; and the Houses are displeased with the
Armies hard usage of him, and yet both ruin him; the one bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to the Block, and holding him there by the Hair of the
Head, and the other cutting off his Head. The <hi>Scots</hi> durst not trust
the Cavaliers with him, nor the Houses the <hi>Scots,</hi> nor the Army (a
King at lowest advanceth that party where he is, though a priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
the Houses, nor the Juncto all the Army; nor <hi>N.</hi> the Juncto,
being never safe till he put his finger into the Royal Neck, to see
after execution, whether the head were really severed from the
body? All the quarrel was, that the Cavaliers kept the King from
the Parliament, and the meaning of it, it seems was, <hi>That they kept
him from the Block.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Prince, they destroyed that they durst not despise, all the
Grandees in the Army not daring to own the least murtherous
thoughts towards him publickly, when they set<note n="a" place="margin">Who after the King, death, finding their Masters jugglers, would have done in much for them as they had done for the King, until the Officers would have laid them aside which they could not do till several of them were executed.</note> Agitators, <hi>i. e.</hi>
two active Souldiers out of every Regiment in the Army (now
modelled into such desparate Sects and Villanies) to consult about
the horrid Fact in private, and to draw a bloudy Paper, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of the people, which was but a conspiracy of Traitors;
<hi>Cromwell</hi> assuring the King, as he had a soul, that he should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored.
And his Son <hi>Ireton</hi> at the same time Drawing up a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
that he should dye. The Army treat him like a Prince (and
that they might deceive his devout soul the more securely, allow
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59370:107"/>
him the service of his Chaplains, and the Liberty of his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the greatest injoyments left him in this world) with a design
the more successfully to use him like a Traitor. Ah brave Prince!
that none durst have abused, had they owned what they design,
whom the Houses had saved, had they not been Cajoled by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and the Army, had it not been Cajoled by the Houses. The
King granted too much (saith Sir <hi>H. V.</hi> to him at the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Wight</hi>)
and too little saith the same man to the Houses) and the King must
dye, when whatsoever they asked, they meant his life.</p>

done under him, so (he, as King, being capable of doing no wrong)
they might suffer all for him. If the horror that seized all Princes
of the world, Turkish and Heathenish, as well as Christian, upon

suffered this to have happened the King, but that (by the just
hand of God) as bad had happened them; that very Army that
they imployed to turn his Majesty out of his just Power, pulled
them out of their usurped one. If the Declarations of their own
Judges; if the strong Prayers and Sermons, that could raise Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

               <p>But stay Reader, and take that Treason in the retail of it, that
thou art amazed at in the gross: See a King, having treated at the
<hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> upon the faith of a kingdom, for his honor and life,
in the face of that kingdom bereaved of both. A King, that had
the Oaths and Protestations of three Kingdoms to secure his life,
loosing it in one of them; where the the Rebels (like the thieves
that sate on <hi>Shuters-hill,</hi> upon the honest man for felony) impeach
him of that treason they themselves were guilty of. Fond men!

could dispatch a Majesty, that a great while they durst not, against
so many obligations of heaven and earth, put to death; and yet
durst, against their own fears and guilt suffer to live! They durst
judge and condemn him, aggravating a horrid treason, with a
more horrid pretence: Hereby Law and Justice were forced (like
Queen <hi>Anne Bulloigns</hi> Father, being Judge at his Daughters death)
to assist in a Parricide against their own Father and Author. Why
these ceremonies, formalities, and circumstances of Villany? why
doth Treason chuse the Bench, rather than the Vault? and to
Sentence rather than to Blow up; but that the Traytors within
being more Villains than those without, had a design to render Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
it self as ridiculous as the great Master of it; and assassinate
Law it self, as well as the Law-giver.</p>
               <p>First, they lay violent hands on themselves (threatning the
Lords, they should Sit no longer if they concurred not, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the House of Commons to forty, of the reproach of that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly)
and then on his Majesty. It was necessary first, that they
should murder the Parliament, by excluding, vexing, and abusing
above four hundred of the Commons, and laying aside all the
Lords, before they could come at the King; and leave not a sober
man in power, before they robbed that good Man of his life.</p>
               <p>This contemptible forty, of whom yet twenty dissented, Vote
with their Mercenary and Fanatick Army, with whom<note n="b" place="margin">A Vote once before Passed, but surreptitiously, and repealed by the whole House.</note> they
hoped to share in their spoils and power; no more Addresses to
the King, nor any more Peace, and what was more ridiculous, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
their own Crimes by their own Vote.</p>
               <p>Votes so daringly overturning Foundations, that all men seeing
all Law and Government cut off by them at one blow, looked to
their Throats, Estates, and Children, when all that secured these
was at one breath overturned. Here is a power ascribed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that they never owned, and a power derived from them that
they never granted; here are the People brought in to judge their
King; that abhorred it; and the King tried for war against his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when all the People were ready to lay down their lives in a
war for him. Here are the Commons of <hi>England</hi> pretended, when
the whole House of Commons was almost excluded, and none but
such persons (as were known Adulterers, Cheats, two Coblers, one
Brewer, one Goldsmith, one Indicted for Committing a Rape,
another for writing Blasphemy against the Trinity, another having
said, that <hi>Diodorus Seculus</hi> was a better Author than <hi>Moses,</hi>) first
asserting to themselves this new authority, and then exercising it.
These that were to be brought to the Bar themselves, bring the
King, in whose name all Malefactors were tried, to the Bar himself.
Those that had been eight years indeavouring to murder the King
in a war, are made his Judges now that war is over. A pretty sight,
to have seen <hi>Clement, Ravillaic, Faux, Catesby,</hi> and <hi>Garnet,</hi> one day
indeavouring to dispatch a King, and the next advanced to be his
Judges. After prayers and fasts (the great fore-runners of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief)
whereby they indeavoured as impudently to ingage God in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59370:108"/>
the villany he forbid, as they had done the people (for the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance
framed by <hi>Ireton</hi> for questioning the King, was called the
Agreement of the people) in a Treason they all abhorred.</p>
               <p>When all the Ministry of <hi>England,</hi> and indeed of the world,
cryed down the bloudy design, contrary to Oaths, and Laws, and
common reason, as the shame and disgrace of Religion: These
Assassinates were satisfied with the preaments of one Pulpit Buffoon
<hi>Peters,</hi> a wretched fellow, that since he was whipt by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
of <hi>Cambridge</hi> when a youth, could not endure government
never after; and the Revelation of a mad <hi>Herfordshire</hi> woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring

               </p>
               <p>All the Nation abhorred their proceedings, therefore they hasten

intrusted, and imployed for the safety of the Nation, being
by Him or his Agents corrupted, to the betraying of their Trust,
and revolting from the Parliament, have had Entertainment and
Commission, for the continuing and renewing War and Hostility
against the said Parliament and People, as aforesaid. By which
cruel and unnatural wars by Him, the said <hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> Levyed,
Continued, and Renewed, as aforesaid, much innocent bloud of
the Free-people of this Nation hath been spilt, Families undone,
the Publick Treasury wasted and exhausted, Trade obstructed and

               <p>A Charge ridiculous in the matter of it, laying that war to the
Kings charge, for which they should have been hanged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
accusing him for breaking the Priviledges of Parliaments,
when they had the other day dissolved the very Being of them;
and pretending the common good, when two or three years disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
the whole Plot was nothing but private Interest; these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Miscreants being turned to grass, by one of their own self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers,
for a self-seeking Combination. Contemptible in the
framers of it, the one a Runnagate <hi>Dutch-man, Dorislaus,</hi> who being
preferred by the King, <hi>History Professor</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> read Treason,
in his first Lecture against his Patron, and now commits it: The

a Proclamation to invite all persons to witness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King, appearing to promote so horrid a fact, and these
hired men of <hi>Belial,</hi> with the hope of a morsel of bread. The King
was always of an even temper, but never more than in this case,
retaining a Majesty becoming himself in his misery, and looking
as if he were, as he ought to be indeed, the Judge; and they, as
they were indeed, the Malefactors: Smiling (as he might well, as
far as the publick calamities gave him leave) at the horrid names
<hi>(Murderer, Traytor, &amp;c.)</hi> of the worst Subjects given to the best

on the contrary command obedience to Princes; nor by the Laws of the

do the Laws give any power to the <hi>Lower House,</hi> of judging even the

which might be pretended extraordinary, delegated from the people,
since they had not asked the consent so much as of every tenth man in this
matter; and that if power without Laws may set up Courts, he knew not
how any man could be safe in his Life or Estate; it being not his own, but

               <p>All the great throng that pittied, but could not help, afflicted
Majesty, with whom they saw themselves drawn to the slaughter,
groaned upon the Sentence, but with the peril of their lives; It
being as fatal then, for any persons to own respect or kindness to
Majesty, as it was for the King to carry it; and as dangerous for
others to be good Subjects, as for him to be a good King. They
that were to force him out of his Life, forced others out of their
Loyalty; endeavouring fondly to depose him from his Subjects
hearts, as they had done from his Throne. Several persons hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
since deposed, that to set off their ridiculous Scene, they had
those who were appointed to force poor creatures to cry <hi>Iustice,
Iustice,</hi> (who, as the excellent Prince observed, would have done
as much for money for their own Commanders) a word one of
them in Command then said, since he cried, because, if it had been
heard, the Traytors had been at the Bar, and the Judges of
the Land at the Bench; and deterr others from saying, <hi>God
save the King:</hi> Notwithstanding which force, this last voice was
the most hearty, and the other most forced. Observable it is,
that to make his Majesty parallel with his great Pattern, whom he
represented equally in his Sufferings, and in his Goodness and
Power, a wretch, that was within a little while executed by his
own Partner, Spit in his Face, whereat his Majesty not moved,
only wiped the Spittle, and said, <hi>My Saviour suffered much more for
me.</hi> The Excellent Prince (while the Traytors before him, were
as much slaves to their base Malice, Envy, Fear, Ambition, and
Cruelty, as the poor People were to them) exercising as ample a
Dominion over himself now, as he had heretofore over three
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59370:113"/>
kingdoms; looking not as if he were before the Miscreants, but
they before him; and he to give, as he did, and not receive a
Doom.</p>
               <p>I cannot forget how an Ancient Father saith, <q>That some crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

               <p>HAving already made my Protestations, not only against the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legality
of this pretended Court; but also, that no earthly
Power can justly call me (who am your King) in question as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent:
I would not any more open my mouth upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
more than to referr my self to what I have spoken, were I
alone in this case concerned. But the duty I owe to God in the
preservation of the true Liberty of my People, will not suffer me
at this time to be silent: For, how can any free-born Subject of
<hi>England</hi> call life, or any thing he possesseth his own, if power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
right daily make new, and abrogate the old fundamental Law
of the Land? which I now take to be the present case: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when I came hither, I expected that you would have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to have satisfied me concerning these grounds, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me to answer to your pretended Impeachment; but since I
see nothing I can say will move you to it (though Negatives are
not so naturally proved as Affirmatives) yet I will shew you the
reason, why I am confident you cannot judge me, nor indeed the
meanest man in <hi>England:</hi> For I will not (like you) without shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59370:116"/>
a reason, seek to impose a belief upon my Subjects.</p>
               <p>There is no proceeding just against any man,<note place="margin">Hereabouts he was stopped, being not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to speak any more of Reasons.</note> but what is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
either by Gods Laws, or the Municipal Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
where he lives. Now I am most confident, that this days pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
cannot be warranted by Gods Laws; for on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the authority of the obedience unto Kings is clearly warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and strictly commanded both in the Old and New Testament;
which if denied, I am ready instantly to prove: And for the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
now in hand, there it is said, <hi>That where the word of a King is,
there is power; and who may say unto him, what dost thou?</hi> Eccles.
8. 4. Then for the Laws of this Land, I am no less confident, that
no learned Lawyer will affirm, that an Impeachment can lye against
the King, they all going in his Name; and one of their Maxims is,
<hi>That the King can do no wrong.</hi> Besides, the Law, upon which you
ground your proceedings, must either be old or new; if old, shew
it; if new, tell what authority warranted by the Fundamental
Laws of the Land hath made it, and when: But how the House of
Commons can erect a Court of Judicature, which was never one it
self (as is well known to all Lawyers) I leave to God and the
World to judge: And were full as strange, that they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to make Laws without King or Lords House, to any that have
heard speak of the Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And admitting, but not granting, that the People of <hi>Englands</hi>
Commission, could grant your pretended power, I see nothing
you can shew for that; for certainly you never asked the question
of the tenth man of the kingdom, and in this way you manifestly
wrong even the poorest Plough-man, if you demand not his free
consent; nor can you pretend any colour for this your pretended
Commission, without the consent, at the least, of the major part of
every man in <hi>England,</hi> of whatsoever quality or condition, which
I am sure you never went about to seek; so far are you from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it: Thus you see, that I speak not for my own Right alone, as
I am your King, but also for the true Liberty of all my Subjects,
which consists not in the sharing the power of Government, but in
living under such Laws: Such a Government as may give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the best assurance of your lives, and propriety of their
goods. Nor in this must, or do I forget the Priviledges of both
Houses of Parliament, which this days proceedings doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
violate, but likewise occasion the greatest breach of their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith, that I believe ever was heard of, with which I am far
from charging the two Houses: For all the pretended crimes laid
against me, bear date long before the late Treaty at <hi>Newport,</hi> in
which I having concluded as much as in me lay, and hopefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the two Houses agreement thereunto, I was suddenly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
and hurried from thence as a Prisoner, upon which account
I am against my will brought hither; where since I am come, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but to my power defend the Ancient Laws and Liberties of
this Kingdom, together with my own just Right. Then, for any
thing I can see, the Higher House is totally excluded. And for
the House of Commons, it is too well known, that the major part
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59370:116"/>
of them are detained or deterred from Sitting; so, as if I had no
other, this were sufficient for me to protest against the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of your pretended Court. Besides all this, the peace of
the kingdom is not the least in my thoughts, and what hopes of
settlement is there, so long as power reigns without rule of Law?
Changing the whole frame of that Government, under which this
kingdom hath flourished for many hundred years (nor will I say
what will fall out, in case this lawless, unjust proceeding against
me do go on.) And believe it, the Commons of <hi>England</hi> will not
thank you for this change, for they will remember how happy
they have been of late years under the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
the King my Father, and my self, until the beginning of these unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
troubles; and will have cause to doubt, that they shall never
be so happy under any new. And by this time it will be sensibly
evident, that the Armes I took up, were only to defend the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Laws of this kingdom, against those who have supposed
my power hath totally changed the ancient Government.</p>
               <p>Thus having shewed you briefly the Reasons, why I cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to your pretended Authority, without violating the trust
which I have from God, for the welfare and liberty of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
I expect from you, either clear reasons to convince my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
shewing me that I am in an error (and then truly I will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
answer) or that you will withdraw your proceedings.</p>
               <p>With what composedness of Spirit, and patience he heard the
pretended Charge, and all its Slanders and Reproaches, smiling at
the words <hi>Tyrant, Traytor,</hi> &amp;c. with what Authority he demanded,
by what lawful Power, grounded on Gods Word, or warranted by
the Constitutions of the Kingdom, they proceeded! with what ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness
he admonished them,<note n="a" place="margin">Telling them, that it was not a slight thing that they were about.</note> both what Guilt, and what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <p>With what resolution he told them, <hi>He would not betray the Trust

(as if they intended the loss of his soul as well as his life) with two
things he was equally averse to, <hi>Impertinent Talk</hi> and <hi>Tobacco.</hi> Much

through the <hi>Banqueting-house</hi> to the adjoyning Scaffold, every way
dressed to terror, with the same spirit he used to ascend his
Throne, shewing no fear of death, but a sollicitude for those that
were to live after. He thought it to as little purpose to Harange
the Army, as to complement a Mastive or a Tyger; and others
were kept at such distance, that they might see, but not hear; and
therefore expressed himself thus to those that stood near him.</p>

peace very well, if I did not think, that holding my peace would
make some men think, that I submit to the guilt as well as to the
punishment; but I think it my duty to God and to my Country
to clear my self as an honest man, as a good King, and a good
Christian. I shall first begin with my Innocency: In troth, I think
it is not very needful for me to insist long upon this, for all the
world knows, that I did not begin a War with the two Houses of
Parliament; and I call God witness, to whom I must shortly make
an account, that I never did intend to incroach on their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
they began upon me: It is the Militia they began upon,
they confest the Militia was mine, but they thought it fit to have it
from me: And to be short, if any man will look to the dates of
Commissions, of theirs, and mine; and likewise to the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
will see clearly, that they began these unhappy Troubles, not
I: So that as the guilt of these enormous Crimes that are laid
against me, I hope in God, that God will clear me of; I will not, I am
in charity: God forbid, that I should lay it upon the two Houses
of Parliament, there is no necessity of either, I hope they are free
of this guilt; for I do believe that illinstruments between them and
me, has been the chief cause of this blood-shed: So that by way,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59370:119"/>
or speaking, as I find my self clear of this, I hope (and pray God)
that they may too; yet for all this, God forbid that I should b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> so
ill a Christian, as not to say, Gods Judgements are just upon me;
many times he does pay Justice by unjust Sentence, that is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
I will only say this, that an unjust<note n="a" place="margin">Strafford.</note> Sentence that I suffered
to take effect, is punished now by an unjust Sentence upon me, this
I have said to shew you that I am an innocent Man.</p>
               <p>Now to shew you that I am a good Christian: I hope there is<note n="b" place="margin">Pointing to Dr. <hi>Juxon.</hi>
                  </note>
a good man that will bear me witness, that I have forgiven all the
world, and even those in particular, that have been the causers of
my death; who they are, God knows, I do not desire to know, I
pray God forgive them. But this is not all, my charity must go
farther; I wish that they may repent, for indeed they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
a great sin in this particular. I pray God, with St. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
that this be not laid to their charge, nay, not only so, but that they
may take the right way to the Peace of the Kingdom; for my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
commands me, not only to forgive particular men, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to the last gasp, the Peace of the Kingdom. So, Sir, I do
wish with all my soul (and I do hope there are some<note n="c" place="margin">Turning to some Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that wrote.</note> here will
carry it farther) that they may endeavour the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Now, Sirs, I must shew you, both how you are out of the way,
and will put you in the way: First, you are out of the way; for
certainly, all the way you ever have had yet, as I could find by any
thing, is in the way of Conquest; certainly, this is an ill way;
for Conquest, Sir, in my opinion, is never just, except there be a
good just cause, either for matter of wrong, or just title, and then
if you go beyond it, the first quarrel that you have to it, is it that
makes it unjust in the end, that was just at first: But if it be only
matter of Conquest, then it is a great Robbery; as a Pyrate said
to <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was the greater Robber, himself but a petty
one: And so Sir, I think the way you are in, is much out of the
way. Now, Sir, to put you in one way; believe it, you will never
do right, nor God will never prosper you, until you give God his
due, the King his due, (that is, my Successors) and the People their
due; I am as much for them as any of you: you must give God
his due, by rightly regulating his Church (according to his Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
which is now out of order. To set you in a way particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
now I cannot, but only this, <hi>A National Synod freely called,</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
debating among themselves, must settle this; when every opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is freely and clearly heard.</p>
               <p>For the King, indeed, I will not (<hi>then turning to a Gentleman that
touched the Axe</hi>) said, Hurt not the<note n="d" place="margin">Meaning, if he did blunt the edge.</note> Axe, that may hurt me.</p>
               <p>For the King, the Laws of the Land will clearly instruct you
for that, therefore, because it concerns my own particular, I only
give you a touch of it.</p>
               <p>For the People, and truly, I desire their Liberty and Freedom as
much as any body whatsoever; but I must tell you, that their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Freedom consists in having of Government, those Laws
by which their Life and Goods may be most their own. It is not
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59370:119"/>
for having share in Government (Sir) that is nothing pertaining to
them: A Subject, and a Soveraign, are clean contrary things; and
therefore, until they do that, I mean, that you do put the People in
that Liberty, as I say, certainly they will never enjoy themselves.</p>
               <p>Sir, it was for this that I am now come here: If I would have
given way to an Arbitrary way, to have all Laws changed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the power of the Sword, I needed not have come here, and
therefore I tell you (and I pray God it be not laid to your charge)
that I am the Martyr of the People.</p>
               <p>Introth Sirs, I shall not hold you much longer, for I will only say
this to you, that in truth I could have desired some little time long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
because I would have put this that I have said in a little more
order, and a little better digested then I have done, and therefore
I hope you will excuse me.</p>
               <p>I have delivered my Conscience, I pray God you may take those
courses that are best for the good of the Kingdom, and your own
salvations.</p>

say no more. <hi>Then turning to Col.</hi> Hacker, <hi>he said,</hi> Take care they
do not put me to pain, and Sir, this, if it please you. <hi>Then a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

take heed of the Axe. <hi>Then speaking to the Executioner, said,</hi> I shall
say but very short prayers, and when I thrust out my hands.—</p>
               <p>Then the King called to Dr. <hi>Juxon</hi> for his Night-cap, and having
put it on, he said to the Executioner, <hi>Do's my Hair trouble you?</hi> who
desired him to put it all under his Cap, which the King did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
by the help of the Executioner and the Bishop: Then the
King turning to Dr. <hi>Juxon</hi> said, <hi>I have a good Cause, and a gracious

                  <p> There is but one Stage more, this Stage is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and turbulent, it is a short one; but you may consider it
will soon carry you a very great way: It will carry you from
Earth to Heaven; And there you shall find a great deal of cordial
Joy and Comfort.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p> I go from a Corruptible to an Incorruptible Crown; where no
disturbance can be, no disturbance in the world.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Iuxon.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p> You are Exchanged from a Temporal to an Eternal
Crown, a good Exchange.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>The King then said to the Executioner, <hi>Is my Hair well?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the King took off his Cloak and George, and giving his

               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:59370:120"/>
Then the King put off his Doublet, and being in his Wastcoat,
put his Cloak on again, and looking on the Block, said to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner,
<hi>You must set it fast.</hi>
               </p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Executioner.</speaker>
                  <p> It is fast, Sir.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>King.</speaker>
                  <p> When I put my hands out this way, stretching them out,
then ...</p>
               </sp>
               <p>After that, having said two or three words (as he stood) to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
with Hands and Eyes lifted up, immediately stooping down,
laid his Neck upon the Block: And then the Executioner again
putting his Hair under his Cap, the King said, (thinking he had
been going to strike) <hi>Stay for the Sign.</hi>
               </p>
               <sp>

as much envy as advantage; and indeed, though he was singular
in other felicities, he was wrapped in the common unhappiness
in this case: For <hi>Christmas</hi> 1610. Arch bishop <hi>Abbot</hi> set the good
Lord Chancellor <hi>Ellsmen</hi> to suggest to King <hi>Iames</hi> his being Popish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

who he found had done him many ill offices; who <hi>Octob.</hi> 3. 1623.

            <p>
               <hi>April.</hi> 3. 1624. He went to Arch-bishop <hi>Abbot</hi> about a course he
had taken to ease the Church in times of paying the Subsidies to be
given that Parliament (which the Lord Keeper <hi>Williams,</hi> and the
Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi> approved so well, that they confessed it was the
best office that was done for the Church for seven years before.)
His Grace was very angry, <hi rend="margQuotes">Asked what he had to do to make any
Suit for the Church; telling him, that never any Bishop attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the like at any time, nor would any but himself have done it:
that he had given such a wound in speaking to any Lord of the

must needs sink under three Subsidies a year;</hi> his Error, if it were

he intended.</p>
            <p>1. What he did.</p>
            <p>1. 1607. No sooner was he Invested in any of his Livings, than
he Invested twelve poor people in a constant allowance out of
hose Livings; besides his constant repairing of the Houses, and
furnishing of the Churches wheresoever he came.</p>
            <p>2. When he was chosen, with much opposition both there and
at Court, <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. he set up a great Organ in St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Chappel,
being to be tracked every where by his great Benefactions. Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fifth part of all his Incomes to charitable and pious uses:
He built a Chappel and repaired the Cathedral at St. <hi>Davids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon occasion both of the abrupt beginning and ending of
publick Prayers on the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> he settled a better order
in the Kings Chappel, as Dean of that Chappel, prevailing with
that Gracious King, that he would be present at the Liturgy as well
as the Sermon; and that at whatsoever time of Prayers he came,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59370:124"/>
the Priest who Ministred should proceed to the end of Prayers,
which was not done before from the beginning of King <hi>Iames</hi> his
reign to that day.</p>
            <p>1629, 1630. He furnished the Library of <hi>Oxford</hi> with 1300 He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
Arabick, Persian Manuscripts, and choise Antiquities, the
University with their excellent Statutes,<note n="a" place="margin">With new Priviledge, as large as those in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> since 11. the eighth h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge in it with useful and curious buildings;
a Colledge that as well as <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> might be called <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
Colledge.</p>
            <p>From the year 1630. to the year 1640. he recovered hundreds of
Impropriations in <hi>Ireland,</hi> procuring of King <hi>Charles</hi> to give all
Impropriations, yet remaining in the Crown within the Realm of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to that poor Church.</p>
            <p>1630. He set upon the repair of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> the only Cathedral in
Christendom of that name, allowing, besides a great sum to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
it, five hundred pounds a year while he was Bishop of <hi>London,</hi>
and no doubt after he was Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> till it was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
            <p>1633. He retrenched the extraordinary Fees at Court for
Church-preferments, sometimes to prevent the Extortion of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Officers, doing poor Ministers business himself, rather than
they should be at the charge of having it done by others.</p>
            <p>1634. He began the settlement of the Statutes of all the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals
of the new foundation; whose Statutes are imperfect and not
confirmed; and finished those of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1635. He procured and bought settled <hi>Commendams,</hi> whereof
several <hi>sine Cura,</hi> on the small Bishopricks of <hi>Bristol, Peterbourgh,</hi>
St. <hi>Asaph, Chester,</hi> and <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1636. He set up a Greek Press in <hi>London,</hi> buying both Matrices
and Press for Printing of the Library <hi>M. SS.</hi> and others he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to make a rare Collection of.</p>
            <p>The same year he erected an Arabick Lecture in <hi>Oxford,</hi> first
settled there for his life, and afterwards for ever, as he did an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital
at <hi>Reading,</hi> with 200<hi>l. per annum</hi> Revenue, established in a
new way.</p>
            <p>1637. A Book in Vellam of the Records in the <hi>Tower,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

            <p>A new Charter for the Town of <hi>Reading,</hi> and a new Charter and
Statutes for the Colledge and University of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What he Intended.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. He had cast a Model for the increase of the Stipends of poor
Vicars.</item>
               <item>2. He intended to see the Tithes of <hi>London</hi> setled, between the
Clergy and the City.</item>
               <item>3. He thought to have setled some hundreds a year upon the
Fabrick of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> towards the repair till that be finished, and to
keep it in good state afterwards,<note n="b" place="margin">Wherein be did intend to hang as great, and as tuneable a Ring of Bells, as any are in the world.</note> communicating likewise to a
friend to rebuild the great Tower some yards higher than before.</item>
               <item>4. He purposed to have opened the great Square at <hi>Ouford,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59370:125"/>
Saint <hi>Maries,</hi> the Schools, <hi>Brasen-Nose,</hi> and <hi>All-Souls.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. He resolved to set on foot the buying in of Impropriations,
hoping to be able to buy in two or three in a year.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Not to mention his Entertainments of the King and Queen, to
the honor and advantage of the University of <hi>Oxon,</hi> when he was
Chancellor there; his bestowing all his favors upon no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
than something to be done by his Clients in acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them for the Church. So he obliged Bishop <hi>Bancroft</hi> to
build the Bishoprick a House; another to bestow the Patronage of
upon St. <hi>Iohns:</hi> A third, to raise the Stipends of three
Vicarages in his gift, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> His preferring of Church-men to the
greatest Places of Trust, to honor Religion, too much despised in
the later times. For see his design in the advancement of that
good man, Bishop <hi>Iuxon,</hi> as it is expressed in his Diary (and an exact
Diary is a window to his heart that maketh it.)</p>
            <q>
               <hi>March 6. William Iuxon,</hi> Lord Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> made Lord
High-Treasurer of <hi>England,</hi> no Church-man had it since <hi>Henry</hi>
the Sevenths time: I pray God bless him to carry it so, that the
Church may have honor, and the King, and the State service and
contentment by it. And now if the Church will not hold up
themselves under God, I can do no more.</q>
            <p>His daily Hospitality, and weekly Almes, and other the great
effects of a very great spirit, that had not so great a prize in its
hand, as he had a large heart to dispose thereof for the general
good; looking upon himself <hi>as</hi> the <hi>Steward,</hi> rather than the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
of his great Revenues, might have excused his height from
envy, as well as that of the heavens, that are not maliced because
high, but reverenced because benign; none grudging them either
the Place they hold, or the Vapors they draw up; because all are
blessed with the Influences they shed, and the Showers they send:
And the rather, because he was as great himself as his performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and his preferments were not only means to do good works,
but the just reward of great parts; parts every way becoming the
greatest Clergy-man and States-man; and indeed few or none
envied his preferments, that were not afraid of his abilities;
he being reckoned one of the greatest Scholars of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
His judgment being as acute (witness the exactest
Piece ever writ on that subject, his Controversie with <hi>Fisher)</hi> as his
Eye was piercing, his Memory as firmly retaining his Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as his Apprehension took them <hi>Discerningly,</hi> and his Industry
collected them <hi>Vnweariedly.</hi> He was not advanced because he
would keep a good House, repair his Barns, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> any Dunce may
do this; but, because he seemed born to the honor he was raised
to, owing his degree not only to Favour, but to Nature too; he
being exact in all the recommending excellencies of humane ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments,
thought deserving more honor beyond Sea, than
those he was envied for here. In all those Arts and Sciences
he honored with some thoughts about, he was not so much skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as commanding; not only knowing, but a Master; and having
gone through the difficulties of Ingenuity with as much success
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59370:125"/>
as a Scholar, as he did the difficulties of Government as a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
in both a <hi>Primate,</hi> in both <hi>excelling.</hi> The forementioned Piece
composed with such an authentick and unerring accuracy, as if
there had been a Chair of Infallibility at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> as well as at
<hi>Rome,</hi> and he had been indeed what his Predecessors have been
called, <hi>Papa alterius Orbis,</hi> and each word had been decreed by the
Crosier, than written with the Sword, deserved the highest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
in that Church, whereof it was the best defence,
which how ever ridiculously at first ascribed to others, was so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to him, that his very enemies confessed he did it, because,
none else: So hard it is to counterfeit the great Genius and Spirit
of Honor, and there are in such Books the inimitable peculiarities
of an incommunicable faculty and condition.</p>
            <p>To which, when you adde the exemplary strictness of his Life,
witness his care in keeping a constant Diary of it. He is a good
Christian that Audits the account of his soul every day, as he a
good husband that casts up the expences of his occasions every
night. The tenderness of his Conscience evident in this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
passages of his Devotion.</p>

as he saw go in rich or gaudy dresses under his common and

Cloaths at home, and I have worse;</hi> whereat his Lordship rested
very well contented: wearing his hair short, and injoyning others
so to do; not enduring to know any of his kindred if they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with flaunting Cloaths, long hair, or smelt either of Tobacco
or Wine. <hi>I knew</hi> (saith an Historian) <hi>a near Kinsman of his</hi> (by the

            <p>The great influence of his publick spirit reaching not onely so

should be Libelled so often,<note place="margin">His sufferings.</note> as I have formerly mentioned he was.
Why his house should be sacked Munday <hi>May</hi> 11. 1640. about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
by 500 persons of the rascal riotous multitude, according to
the Paper posted upon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> exhorting them so to do, <hi>May</hi>
9. to his utter ruine, had not he upon timely notice fortified his
house, taken and punished the Ringleaders in spight of the tumult
that brake all the prisons about the Town; and severely threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him in a Libel <hi>September</hi> 1. with another assault in the Kings
absence. Why he should receive such a Letter as he did from one
Mr. <hi>Rocket,</hi> informing him, <q>That he was among the Scots as he
travelled through the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> he heard them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh,
and rail against the Archbishop exceedingly; and they
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59370:126"/>
hoped shortly to see him, as the Duke was, slain by one least su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected.</q>
Why the Scots Commissioners should name him in the
House of Lords an Incendiary, and in the House of Commons a
Traytor, <hi>Dec.</hi> 16. 17, 18. Why he should be committed to the Black
Rod and confined, being only permitted to go to <hi>Lambeth</hi> for a
Book or two, and some Papers for his defence against the Scots,
where he staid late, (hearing with comfort the 93. and 94.
Psalms, and the 50. of <hi>Isaiah</hi>) to avoid the gazing of the people;
why they should make him as soon as he was confined <hi>December</hi> 21.
sell Plate to pay 500 <hi>l.</hi> for punishing a known Adultery, in which
case, he said, <q>Suppose it was more than the Law strictly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
what may be done for Honor and Religions sake?</q> Why <hi>D. C.</hi>
24. there should be a resolution among the Lords to sequester
him from the Kings Counsel, and deprive him of his Arch-Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;
not onely, <hi>as he saith,</hi> before he had put any answer in for
himself, but likewise before his adversaries put in any Charge
against him? Why Fryday <hi>Feb.</hi> 26. after full ten weeks Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Mr. <hi>Maxwells</hi> house, he should be ordered to the Tower?
why he should be followed, and railed at by the people and rabble
in multitudes in his way thither, as he went in Mr. <hi>Maxwells</hi> Coach
to the very Tower-gates? and indeed it was thought he was sent
that way on purpose to be torn in pieces by the rabble.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>Octob.</hi> 23. 1642. his Jurisdiction should be requestred to
his inferior Officers, and his Spirituals and Temporals suspended,
he having not so much as power to bestow a Living? Why <hi>Nov.</hi>
8. 42. his house should be seized for a Garison and Prison, his
Rents sequestred, as was pretended, to keep the Kings Children?
Why <hi>October</hi> 24. he should be so closely confined, as to be debarred
the liberty of the <hi>Tower,</hi> nor to speak with any Prisoner or other
person, but in the presence of his Warder; all his Servants being
removed from him but two, and they not to speak with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor with any other, but before the Warder, nor to stir out
without the Lieutenants leave? Why <hi>Nov.</hi> 24. his Chappel was
broken open at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and the Furniture of it spoiled, his Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es
at the same time being seized by order from the Committee,
and all his provision in the house spent upon the prisoners.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>March</hi> 24. 1642/3. there should be a plot to send him and
Bishop <hi>Wren</hi> to <hi>New-England</hi> within fourteen days, and <hi>April</hi>
25. a motion made to that purpose in the Lower House? Why
<hi>May</hi> 1. his Chappel windows should be defaced, all his Goods and
Books seized upon, and he confined to his Chamber, not to stir
out without his Keeper; and a rumor that he should be removed
to a Prison-lodging.</p>
            <p>Why <hi>Feb.</hi> 26. 1640. so many bitter Speeches should be made of
him, <hi>as of a spiritual wickedness in high places,</hi> and 14 general Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
exhibited against him, with a promise to make them good by
Articles more particular, besides the Impeachment of the Scots
Commissioners, and the further inforcing of the former Articles
by the English, <hi>Oct.</hi> 23. 1643. in ten Articles more, to all which he
was ordered the same day to put in his Answer in writing against

brought to the Bar, and made his answer: whereupon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
for his Tryal met closely at <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> to prepare evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
against him, and his Tryal appointed <hi>Ian.</hi> 8. 1643. first, and
afterwards <hi>Ian.</hi> 16. when about three a Clock in the afternoon
(after three years Imprisonment and no hearing) he appearing,

<hi>March</hi> 4. 9. and 12. All which bitter days they carryed him up and

a mischief, as they did <hi>March</hi> 13, 16, 18. 1643. and <hi>March</hi> 28. 1644.
<hi>April</hi> 16. and <hi>May</hi> 4. 20, 27. and <hi>Iune</hi> 6. 11, 17, 20. 27. <hi>Iuly</hi> 20, 24,

the tyring than destroying of him. All this while not allowing
him to answer his whole Charge at once, but one Article one day,
and another Article another, and not declaring (though earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
petitioned by him so to do) what Articles were Treason, what
Misdemeanors, but sheltering themselves under the old <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>Why, after so many mouths tryal, in which (notwithstanding
their tedious proceedings to break his spirit) he had acquitted
himself with such a confidence as became the constancy and
innocency of a Christian Bishop and Confessor: but yet must fall
to please the Scots and those merciless men, who imputed Gods
anger in the difficulties of their success against their Prince, to the
continuance of this Prelates life: He should be voted guilty of
High-Treason by the little remainder of the House of Commons
at <hi>Westminster, Nov.</hi> 10. 1643. and condemned by seven Lords in
the upper House, (all they not concurring neither) <hi>Decemb.</hi> 17.

<hi>murdering</hi> men by Votes, and of <hi>killing</hi> by an Order of Parliament
(neither House, if full and legally sitting, having power over the
life of the meanest subject without the King) since the Creation.
<hi rend="margQuotes">And why, when the Lords upon his Petition, to the distaste of

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59370:127"/>
some affronts in his Anti-chamber in the Tower, by some
Sons of Schism and Sedition, who unseasonably, that morning he
was preparing himself to appear before the great Bishop of our
souls, would have him give some satisfaction to the godly (for so
they called themselves) for his Persecutions, which he called Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline:
To whom he answered, <hi>That he was now shortly to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all his actions at an higher and more equal Tribunal,</hi> and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
he might not be disturbed in his preparations for it. Others
asked him (to ruffle his soul into a passion, now he was fairly fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it up, to deliver it into the hands of his Redeemer) what were
the most comfortable words a man should dye with in his mouth?
And he mildly answered, <hi>Cupio dissolvi, &amp; esse cum Christo;</hi> adding
meekly (when asked how a man at that time might express his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance)
<hi>That such assurance was to be found within, grounded on the
word of God concerning Christs dying for us, and that no words were able
to express it rightly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why these Indignities to so good a man in his life time, and
more in scandalous Papers of him, when dead, which I hope the

whereof, is a Satyre against our age and Nation, and therefore I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

Bishop <hi>Lindsey,</hi> deservedly preferred indeed by Bishop
<hi>Neile.</hi> 7. The worthy <hi>A. B. Neile,</hi> who was so far from being
preferred by my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that in truth my Lord of <hi>G.</hi>
was advanced by him. 8. The smart, discreet, and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
man Bishop <hi>Wren,</hi> Chaplain to Bishop <hi>Andrews.</hi> 9. He
is charged with the Incouragements he gave Dr. <hi>Heylm,</hi> who was
raised by the Earl of <hi>Denby:</hi> Dr. <hi>Baker, Bray, Weekes, Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi>
who were recommended by the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.
10. It is reckoned his fault, that he interposed with His Majesty for
such worthy men, as Bishop <hi>Vsher</hi> recommended to him in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and that upon a difference between the Lord Keeper and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Wards, about Livings in the Kings Gift; he moved the
King to remove the occasion of those differences, by presenting
to him immediately himself, and that if he recommended a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
man to the King as Chaplain, he trespassed upon my Lord
Chamberlains Office.</p>
            <p>21. Some hundred Books are produced, out of which some
indiscreet passages had been expunged by<note n="b" place="margin">Some his Chaplains, some the Bishop of <hi>Londons.</hi>
               </note> Dr. <hi>Heywood,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Baker,</hi> Dr. <hi>Weekes,</hi> Dr. <hi>Oliver, &amp;c.</hi> and these purgations are laid
upon him: and because the forementioned Gentleman suffered
not bitter expressions that tended to the raising of old and legally
silenced Controversies, to pass the press, as the<note n="c" place="margin">For so they are, when licenced.</note> expressions of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Arch-bishop must come to the Block,
as an enemy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>22. Because a Jesuite contrived a Letter wherein Arminianism
is said to be planted in <hi>England,</hi> to usher in Popery, therefore the
Arch-bishop preferring some worthy men who were of the same
minde with Arminians, had a design to introduce Popery.</p>
            <p>23. The High Commission called in many Books, and punished
Authors, Printers, or Booksellers, and the poor Arch-bishop, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
indeavored the subversion of the Government.</p>
            <p>24. The Kings Declaration to silence the Controversies of the
Church, and his care to check those that endeavored to renew
them: The King and Councels Order at <hi>Woodstock</hi> about the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
1633. at <hi>Oxford:</hi> the Kings perswading of Bishop <hi>Davenant,</hi>

after they were purged, to insert them in. His Majesties appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Bishop <hi>Harsenets</hi> considerations about the Controversies, and
sending them to every Bishop, and his Deputies, reversing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> make up his 21<hi>th.</hi> Charge.</p>
            <p>25. The Star-Chamber Order <hi>Iuly</hi> 1. 1637. about Printing,
whereby the <hi>Geneva</hi> Bibles were prohibited here; and by Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Boswell</hi> suppressed in <hi>Holland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gellibrands</hi> new Almanack
in Mr. <hi>Foxes</hi> his way burned; <hi>Beacon, Palsgraves Religion,</hi> &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
and other Books against the Kings Declaration for laying down
Controversies stifled, through the actions of other men, must be
this good mans fault.</p>
            <p>26. If Popish Books crept in either by imposing on his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59370:129"/>
or being printed without license, though innocent ones
too, he must be guilty of a design against the Protestant Religion</p>
            <p>27. The Kings Command to him to alter the form of Prayer
for the fifth of <hi>November,</hi> Dr. <hi>Potters</hi> request to him to review his
Book called <hi>Charity mistaken,</hi> must be another branch of his
Charge: as was his Majesties Order about sending the Common-Prayer

the Bishops Chaplains presuming to alter the least Syllable

alteration of the Letters Patents for the Palatinate Collection by
the Kings Order, who would not have such expressions pass the
<hi>Great Seal,</hi> as determined some Controversies, as that the Pope
was Antichrist, which neither the Schools nor the Church had
decided, a seventh. His very favourable dealing with the <hi>Walloon,</hi>
the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Church (for which they thanked him) upon
some incroachments of theirs upon the Parishes, where they lived,
an eighth.</p>
            <p>28. 1. The Jesuits whispering into the ears of some fond people
to raise suspicions of him, and so oppositions against him, which was
the sum of Sir <hi>H. M.</hi> Mr. <hi>A. M.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ch. hear-says</hi> of him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
at the Bar.</p>
            <p>2. Rumors raised upon him, because of his acquaintance with
one <hi>Louder Brown,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> reputed Papists; because his suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in <hi>Oxford</hi> concurred in some things with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> where
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself concurred with the Primitive times.</p>
            <p>3. Because Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> writ a Letter to one <hi>W. L.</hi> not to halt
between two Religions.</p>
            <p>4. Because a Doctor in the University preached against those
who were severe against the Puritans, the then predominant Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and moderate against the Catholicks at that time kept un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der,
and that he was pointed at by the University as one of those
discreet men, which indeed moved him, but yet so, that in a
business of that kinde <hi>he thought fit</hi> (in a Letter to Bishop <hi>Neal</hi>) <hi>to be
swaged to a patient course.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Treaty for the <hi>Spanish</hi> Match, which began before he was so
much as Bishop, and ended before he was Privy-Counsel, the

                  <p>MY being in this place in this condition, recalls to my memory
that which I long since read in <hi>Seneca, Tormentum est, etiamsi
absolutus quis fuerit causam dixisse</hi> (6. de Benef. <hi>c.</hi> 28.)<note place="margin">His excellent Defence of himself. 1. His Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Speech.</note> 'Tis not a grief,
only, no; 'tis no less than a torment, for an ingenuous man to plead
Capitally or Criminally, though it should so fall out, that he be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.
The great truth of this, I finde at present in my self; and
so much the more, because I am a Christian; and not that only,
but in <hi>Holy-orders;</hi> and not so only, but by <hi>Gods grace</hi> and <hi>goodness,</hi>

                  <p>And whatsoever the world think of me (and they have been

taught to think much more ill of me, then, I humbly thank Christ
for it, I was ever acquainted with) yet, <hi>My Lords,</hi> this I finde, <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum

                  <p>Nay, <hi>my Lords,</hi> give me leave to speak plain truth; No sentence
that can justly pass upon me (and other I will never fear from your
Lordships) can go so near me, as <hi>Causam dicere,</hi> to plead for my self
upon this occasion, and in this place.</p>
                  <p>For as for the Sentence, be it what it shall, I thank God for it; I
am for it at Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ward (<hi>Acts</hi> 25. 11.) <hi>If I have committed any
thing worthy of death, I refuse not do dye:</hi> For I thank God, I have so
lived, as that I am neither afraid to dye, nor ashamed to live. But
seeing the <hi>Malignity</hi> which hath been raised against me by some
men, I have carried my very life in my hands these divers years
past. But yet, <hi>my Lords,</hi> if there be none of these things whereof

may, and do; not doubting, but that God of his goodness will
preserve my innocency.</p>

                     <hi>My Lords,</hi> the Charge against me is brought up in <hi>ten Articles,</hi> but,
the main heads are two: <hi>An endeavor to subve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t the Laws of the
Land, and the Religion established;</hi> Six Articles (the fift, first and
the last) concern the <hi>Laws,</hi> and the other four <hi>Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Laws, first, I think I may safely say, I have been, to my
understanding, as strict an observer of them all the days of my
life, so far as they concern me, as any man hath; and since I came
into place, I have followed them, and been as much g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ided by them
as any man that sat where I had the honor to sit. And of this I am
sorry I have lost the testimony of the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> and
other persons of Honor since dead.</p>
                  <p>And the Council which attended at the Council-board can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
some of them here present, that in all references to the
<hi>Board,</hi> or debates arising at the <hi>Board,</hi> I was for that part of the
cause, where I found Law to be; and if the Council desired to
have the cause left to the Law, well I might move in some cases,
<hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Conscience</hi> to them; but I left them to the <hi>Law,</hi> if thither
they would go: And how such a carriage as this through the
whole course of my life in private and publick, can stand, with an
intention to overthrow the Laws, I cannot yet see.</p>
                  <p>Nay more, I have ever been of opinion, <hi>That Laws binde the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
and have accordingly made Conscience of observing them:
and this doctrine I have constantly preached as occasion hath been
offered me; and how is it possible, I should seek to overthrow
those Laws which I held my self bound in Conscience to keep and
observe?</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Religion,</hi> I was born and bred up in and under the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> as it stands established by Law; I have by Gods blessing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:59370:132"/>
grown up in it to the years which are now upon me, and to the
place of Preferment which I now bear.</p>
                  <p>I have ever since I have understood ought in my profession, <hi>kept
one constant tenor in this my profession, without variation or shifting
from one opinion to another, for any worldly ends:</hi> And if my consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
would have suffered me to do so, I could easily have slid
through all the difficulties which I have prest upon me in this
kinde: But of all diseases I have held, <hi>a Palsey in Religion most
dangerous;</hi> well knowing and remembring, that disease often ends
in a <hi>dead Palsie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ever since I came in place, I have laboured nothing more, than
that the external publick worship of God (so much slighted in di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vers
parts of this Kingdom) might be preserved, and that with as
much decency and uniformity as might be: for I evidently saw, that
the publick neglect of Gods service in the outward face of it, and
the nasty lying of many places dedicated to that Service, had almost
cast a damp upon the true and inward worship of God, which
while we live in the body needs exterial helps, and all little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to keep it in any vigor. And thus I did to the uttermost of
my knowledge, according both to Law and Canon, and with the
consent and liking of the people; nor did any Command issue out
from me against the one, or without the other.</p>
                  <p>Further my <hi>Lords,</hi> give me leave, I beseech you, to acquaint
you with this also, that I have as little acquaintance with <hi>Recusants,</hi>
as I believe, any man of my place of <hi>England</hi> hath, or ever had si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence
the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and for my kindred, no one of them was
ever a <hi>Recusant,</hi> but Sir <hi>William Web,</hi> Grandchild to my Unkle Sir
<hi>William Web,</hi> sometimes Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and since which
some of his Children I reduced back again to the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On this, one thing more I humbly desire may be thought on,
That I am fallen into a great deal of obloquie in matter <hi>of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ligion,</hi>
and that so far (as appears by the Articles against me) that I <hi>have
indeavoured to advance and bring in Popery:</hi> Perhaps my Lords, I am
not ignorant what party of men have raised these scandals upon
me, nor for what end, nor perhaps by whom set on; but howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
I would fain have a good reason given me, if my conscience
stood that way, and that with my conscience I could subscribe to
the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> what should have kept me here before my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment
to indure the libelling, and the slander, and the base
usage that hath been put upon me, and these to end in this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for my life? I say, I would know a good reason for this.</p>
                  <p>First, my <hi>Lords,</hi> is it because of any pledges I have in the world
to sway me against my conscience? No sure, for I have neither
Wife nor Children to cry out upon me to stay with them; And if
I had, I hope the calling of my conscience should be heard above
them.</p>
                  <p>Is it because I was loth to leave the honor and profit of the place
I was risen too? Surely no, for I desire your Lordships and all the
world should know, I do much scorn the one and the other, in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59370:132"/>
comparison of my conscience. Besides, it cannot be imagined by
any man, but that if I should have gone over to them, I should
not have wanted both <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>profit;</hi> and suppose not so great
as this I have here, yet sure would my conscience have served my
self of either, less with my conscience would have prevailed with
me, more than greater against my conscience.</p>
                  <p>Is it, because I lived here at ease, and was loth to venture my
loss of that? not so neither; for whatsoever the world may be
pleased to think of me, I have led a very painful life, and such as I
would have been content to change, had I well known how; and
would my conscience have served me that way, I am sure I might
have lived at far more ease, and either have avoided the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Libelling and other bitter grievous scorns which have been
put upon me, or at least been out of the hearing of them.</p>
                  <p>Not to trouble your <hi>Lordships</hi> too long, I am so <hi>innocent in the
business in Religion, so free from all practise, or so much as thought of
practise for any alteration unto Popery, or any blemishing the true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion established in</hi> England, <hi>as I was when my mother first
bore me into the world;</hi> And let nothing be spoken but truth, <hi>and
I do here challenge whatsoever is between Heaven or Hell, that can be
said against me in point of my Religion, in which I have ever hated
dissimulation.</hi> And had I not hated it, perhaps I might have been
better for worldly safety then now I am: but it can no way become
a Christian Bishop to halt with God.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, if I had any purpose to blast the <hi>true Religion established
in the Church of England,</hi> and to introduce <hi>Popery,</hi> sure I took a
wrong way to it; for, <hi>my Lords, I have staid more going to</hi> Rome,
<hi>and reduced more that were already gone, then, I believe any Bishop or
Divine in this Kingdom hath done;</hi> and some of them, men of great
abilities, and some persons of great place; and is this the way to
introduce <hi>Popery?</hi> My <hi>Lords,</hi> if I had blemished the true Protestant
<hi>Religion,</hi> how could I have brought these men to it? And if I had
promised to introduce <hi>Popery,</hi> I would never have reduced these
men from it.</p>
                  <p>And that it may appear unto Your <hi>Lordships</hi> how many, and of
what condition the persons are, which by <hi>Gods blessing</hi> upon my
labors, I have setled in the true <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> established in
<hi>England:</hi> I shall briefly name some of them, though I cannot do it
in order of time, as I converted them.</p>

               <head>To the Accusation against him, about Imposing a Liturgy upon
the Church of Scotland, he gave in this true Narrative.</head>
               <p>DOctor <hi>Iohn Maxwell,</hi> the late Bishop of <hi>Rosse,</hi> came to me from
his Majesty. It was during the time of a great sickness,
which I had <hi>Anno</hi> 1629. (which is eleven years since.) The cause
of his coming was to speak with me about a <hi>Lyturgie</hi> for <hi>Scotland.</hi>
At this time I was so extream ill, that I saw him not. And had
death (which I then expected daily) seased on me, I had not seen
this heavy day.</p>
               <p>After this, when I was able to sit up, he came to me again, and
told me, It was his Majesties pleasure, that I should receive some
instructions from some Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi> concerning a <hi>Lyturgrie,</hi>
that he was imployed about it; I told him, I was clear of opinion,
that if his Majesty would have a <hi>Lyturgie</hi> setled there different
from what they had already, it was best to take the English <hi>Lyturgie</hi>
without any variation, that so the same Service-book might pass
through all his Majesties Dominions. To this he replied, that he
was of a contrary opinion, and that not he only, but the Bishops
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59370:133"/>
there, thought their Country-men would be much better satisfied,
if a <hi>Lyturgie</hi> were made by their own Bishops, but withal, that it
might be according to the form of our English Book. I added, if
this were the resolution, I would do nothing till I might by Gods
blessing have health and opportunity to wait upon the King.</p>
               <p>And here give me leave (I humbly beseech you) to tell your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships,
that this was no new conceit of his Majesty to have a <hi>Lyturgy</hi>
framed, and Canons made for the Church of <hi>Scotland:</hi> For he
followed the example and care in the business of his Royal Father
King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memory, who took Order for both at the
Assembly held at <hi>Perth, Anno</hi> 1618. As appears in the Acts of that
General Assembly, and the Sermon which the late Reverend
Arch Bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> preached before it, <hi>pag.</hi> 40. &amp; 68.</p>
               <p>When I was able to go abroad, and came to his Majesty, I repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
all that passed. His Majesty avoided the sending of Dr.
<hi>Maxwell</hi> to me, and the business, but then agreed to my opinion,
to have the English without alteration. And in this case I held the
business for two, if not three, years at least: Afterwards the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
Bishops still pressing his Majesty that a <hi>Lyturgie</hi> made by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and in some things different from the English Service, would
relish better with their Country-men, they prevailed with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
at last to have it so, notwithstanding all I could say or do to
the contrary.</p>
               <p>Then his Majesty commanded me to give the Bishops of <hi>Scotland</hi>
the best assistance I could in this way &amp; work. I delayed as much as
I could with my Obedience. When nothing would serve but it must
go on, I did not only acquaint his Majesty with it, but writ down
most of the amendment or alterations in his Majesties presence.
And do hope there is no one thing in that Book which may not
stand with the Conscience of a right good Protestant. Sure I am,
his Majesty approved them all, and I have his warrant under his
Royal hand for all that I did about that Book.</p>
               <p>As for the way of introducing it, I ever advised the Bishops both
in his Majesties presence, and at other times, that they would look
carefully to it, and be sure to do nothing in any kinde but what
should be agreeable to the Laws of that kingdom. And that they
should at all times as they saw cause, be sure to take the advice of
the Lords of his Majesties Council in that Kingdom, and govern
themselves accordingly. Which course if they have not followed,
that can no way (as I conceive) reflect upon me. And I am able to
prove by other particulars as well as this, that for any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that Nation, I have been as careful their Laws might be
observed, as any man that is a stranger to them might be.</p>

                              <salute>My Lords,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>I Am charged for endeavouring to introduce Popery, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the sum of the Evidence and Arguments given in for to
prove it.</p>
                           <p>First, I have in my first Speech, nominated divers persons of
Eminency, whom I reduced from Popery to our Church, And if
this be so, then the Argument against me is this; I converted many
from Popery, <hi>Ergo,</hi> I went about to bring in Popery, and to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, I am charged to be the Author of the, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Oath in
the New Canons, parcel of which Oath is to abjure Popery, and
that I will not subject the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> (A more strict Oath then ever was made against Popery in
any Age or Church.) And then the agreement against me is this;
I made and took an Oath to abjure Popery, and not to subject the
Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore I was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to Popery, and endeavoured to subject the Church of <hi>England</hi>
to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, The third Canon (of the late New ones) was made by
me, which is against Popery; and then the Argument is; I made
a Canon against Popery; <hi>Ergo,</hi> I was inclinable to, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to introduce it.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, I was twice seriously offered a Cardinalship, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
it; because I would not be subject to the Pope and Church
of <hi>Rome; Ergo,</hi> I was addicted to Popery, and endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duce
the Church of <hi>England</hi> into subjection to the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fifthly, I writ a Book against Popery, in Answer to <hi>Fisher</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit;
and then the Argument is this; I writ a Book against Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> I am inclinable to Popery, and laboured to introduce it.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, It is alledged, I concealed and cherished the Plot of the
Jesuits discovered by <hi>Habernfield;</hi> and therefore I intended to
bring in Popery, and reduce the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church
of <hi>Rome.</hi> I answer, either this Plot was not real; and if so, then
<hi>Romes Masterpiece</hi> is quite blown up, and published in vain. Or else
it was real, and then I was really in danger of my life, for oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Popery and this Plot. Then the Argument from it must be
this; I was in danger of my life, for cherishing the Jesuits Plot
of reducing the Church of <hi>England</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome; Ergo,</hi>
I cherished and endeavoured to effect this Plot.</p>
                           <p>Seventhly, I laboured to make a reconciliation between the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi>
and <hi>Calvinists; Ergo,</hi> I laboured to introduce Popery, and
make a reconciliation between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>These were his general Defences, besides his particular Answers
to each Article of his Charge (consisting of near nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and designed to make up in number, what they wanted, that
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59370:134"/>
the good Prelate might sink under a Cumulative Impeachment, as
his good friend <hi>L. L. I.</hi> did under a Cumulative Treason) so Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
so Pertinent, so Acute, so Full, so Clear, so Quick, and so Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
and well Accommodated <hi>ad homines,</hi> as argued he had
great abilities beyond expectation. A Clear Understanding above
distractions, a Magnanimous Spirit out of the reach of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
a Firm Memory, proof against the infirmities of this age,
and the injuries of the times, a Knowledge grasping most things and
their circumstances, and a Prudence able to put them together to
the most advantage; and in fine, a Soul high and serene above his
afflictions, and what was more, the sence of them, his passions too;
like <hi>Moses,</hi> he that was quick and zealous in Gods and the Kings
cause, was most meek and patient in his own; mastering himself
first, and so (if there had been any place for reason) overcoming
even his adversaries: Had not they injured him so much, that they
thought themselves not safe unless they did injure him more; and
secure themselves from the guilt of their Libels, Tumults, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments,
and Impeachments, by the more dreadful one of his
<hi>Death.</hi> (So men are robbed, first of their Goods, and upon second
thoughts, lest they should complain and retaliate, of their Lives.)
And indeed he could not expect there should be a great distance,
between his Prison and his Grave <hi>[A carceribus ad metam]</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness
of their guilt in burying him above ground in his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,</hi>
could no ways be satisfied, but by <hi>Imprisoning</hi> him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ground by his <hi>Burial.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>When they wanted nothing to compleat their guilt but this
death (concerning which his Majesty in his Letter to the Queen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
himself thus: <q>Nothing can be more evident, than that
<hi>Straffords</hi> Innocent Blood hath been one of the great causes of
Gods just Judgment upon this Nation by a Civil War, both sides
hitherto being almost equally punished, as being in a manner
equally guilty; but now this last crying bloud being totally
theirs, I believe its no presumption hereafter to hope, that his
hand of Justice must be heavier upon them, and lighter upon us;
looking now upon our Cause having passed by our faults)</q> they
preached and talked that nothing interrupted their success but his
death, imputing all their disasters to his impunity, as the Heathens
did all theirs to those like him, <hi>The first good Christians.</hi> Then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>
                  <hi>THis is an uncomfortable time to preach, yet I shall begin
with a Text of Scripture,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. Let us run with patience
that race which is set before us: Looking unto Iesus the Author and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher
of our Faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured
the Cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
Throne of God.</p>
               <p>I have been long in my Race, and how have I looked unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
the Author and Finisher of my faith, he best knows. I am now
come to the end of my Race, and here I finde the Cross, a death
of Shame. But the shame must be despised, or no coming to the
right hand of God. Jesus despised the shame for me, and God
forbid that I should not despise the shame for him.</p>
               <p>I am going apace (as you see) towards the Red Sea, and my
feet are upon the brink of the very brink of it: An Argument I
hope, that God is bringing me into the Land of Promise, for that
was the way through which he led his people.</p>
               <p>But before they came to it, he instituted a Passeover for them. A
Lamb it was, but it must be eaten with sower herbs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 8.
I shall obey, and labour to digest the sower herbs, as well as the
Lamb. And I shall remember it is the Lords Passeover. I shall
not think of the herbs, nor be angry with the hand that gathered
them, but look up only to him who instituted that, and governs
these; for men can have no more power over me then what is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them from above, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 11.</p>
               <p>I am not in love with this passage through the Red Sea, for I have
the weakness of flesh and bloud plentifully in me. And I have
prayed with my Saviour, <hi>Vt transiret calix iste,</hi> that this Cup of
Red Wine might pass from me, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 42. But if not, Gods will,
not mine be done. And I shall most willingly drink of this Cup
as deep as he pleases, and enter into this Sea, yea, and pass through
it in the way that he shall lead me.</p>
               <p>But I would have it remembred (Good people) that when Gods
Servants were in this boysterous Sea, and <hi>Aaron</hi> among them, the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> which persecuted them, and did in a manner drive them
into that Sea, were drowned in the same waters, while they were
in pursuit of them.</p>
               <p>I know my God, whom I serve, is able to deliver me from this
Sea of bloud, as he was to deliver the three Children from the
furnace, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. And (I most humbly thank my Savior for it) my

               <p>And though I am not only the first Archbishop, but the first
man that ever died by an Ordinance in Parliament, yet some of
my Predecessors have gone this way, though not by this means.

me patience. For I hope my cause in Heaven will look of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dy, than the colour that is put upon it here.</p>
               <p>And some comfort it is to me, not only that I go the way of these
great Men in their several Generations; but also that my Charge,
as foul as it is made, looks like that of the Jews against St. <hi>Paul,
Acts</hi> 25. 8. For he was accused for the Law, and the Temple, <hi>i.e.</hi>
Religion. And like that of St. <hi>Stephen, Acts</hi> 6. 14. for breaking
the Ordinances which <hi>Moses</hi> gave, <hi>i.e.</hi> Law, and Religion, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Place, and the Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>But you will say, do I then compare my self with the integrity
of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen?</hi> No, far be it from me. I only raise a
comfort to my self, that these great Saints and Servants of God
were laid at in their times, as I am now. And it is Memorable,
that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who helped on this accusation against St. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
did after fall under the very same himself.</p>
               <p>Yea, but here's a great clamor that I would have brought in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
I shall answer that more fully by and by. In the mean time
you know what the Pharisees laid against Christ himself, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.
48. <hi>If we let him alone, all men will believe on him:</hi> Et venient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,
<hi>And the Romans will come, and take away both our place, and
the Nation.</hi> Here was a causeless cry against Christ, that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
would come; and see how just the Judgment of God was.

of Popery. But on my Conscience, (of which I shall give God a

to the Religion by Law Established,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>2. The second particular, is concerning this great and popu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lous
City (which God bless.) Here hath been of late a fashion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up to gather hands, and then go to the Great Court of the
Kingdom, the Parliament, and clamor for Justice; as if that great
and wise Court, before whom the Causes come which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to the many, could not, or would not do justice but at
their appointment; a way which may endanger any innocent
man, and pluck his bloud upon their heads, and perhaps upon the
Cities also.</p>
               <p>And this hath been lately practised against my self, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
standing still and suffering them openly to proceed from
parish to parish without check. God forgive the setters of this,
with all my heart I beg it: but many well-meaning people are
caught by it.</p>
               <p>In St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Case, when nothing else would serve, they stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up the people against him, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 12. And <hi>Herod</hi> went the
same way: When he had killed St. <hi>Iames,</hi> yet he would not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon St. <hi>Peter,</hi> till he found how the other pleased the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Acts</hi> 12. 3.</p>
               <p>But take heed of having your hands full of bloud, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 15.
For there is a time best known to himself, when God above other
sins makes inquisition for bloud. And when that inquisition is on
foot, the Psalmist tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 12. That God Remembers, but
that's not all, he remembers, and forgets not the Complaint of the
poor, <hi>i.e.</hi> whose bloud is shed by oppression, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>Take heed of this: <hi>'Tis a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the
living God, Heb.</hi> 12. but then especially, when he is making inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
for bloud.</p>
               <p>And with my prayers to avert it, I do humbly desire this City
to remember the Prophecy that is expressed, <hi>Ier.</hi> 26. 15.</p>
               <p>3. The third particular is, the poor Church of <hi>England.</hi> It hath
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59370:137"/>
flourished, and been a shelter to other Neighbor Churches, when
storms have driven upon them. But alas, now it is in a storm it
self, and God only knows whether, or how it shall get out. And
which is worse than a storm from without, it is become like an
Oak cleft to shivers with wedges made out of its own body. And
at every cleft profanneness and irreligion is entring in; <hi>While</hi> (as
<hi>Prosper</hi> speaks) <hi>men that introduce profaneness,</hi>

have lost the substance, and dwell too much in Opinion. And
that Church which all the Jesuits machinations could not ruine,
is now fallen into danger by her own.</p>
               <p>4. The last particular, (for I am not willing to be too long)
is my self, I was born and baptized in the bosom of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> Established by Law, in that Profession I have ever since
lived, and in that I come now to die.</p>
               <p>What clamors and slanders I have endured for laboring to keep
an Uniformity in the external service of God, according to the
Doctrine and Discipline of this Church, all men know, and I have
abundantly felt. Now at last I am accused of High-Treason in
Parliament, a Crime which my soul ever abhorred. This Treason
was Charged to consist of two parts, an endeavor to subvert the
Laws of the Land: And a like endeavor to overthrow the true
Protestant Religion Established by Law.</p>
               <p>Besides my answers to the several Charges, I protested mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
in both Houses. It was said, Prisoners protestations at
the Bar must not be taken. I must therefore come now to it upon
my death, being instantly to give God an account for the truth
of it.</p>
               <p>I do therefore here in the presence of God and his holy Angels
take it upon my death, that I never endeavored the subversion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Law or Religion, and I desire you all to remember this
protest of mine, for my innocency in this, and from all Treasons
whatsoever.</p>
               <p>I have been accused likewise as an Enemy to Parliaments: No,
I understand them, and the benefit that comes by them too well to
be so: But I dislike the misgovernments of some Parliaments ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ways, and I had good reason for it; for <hi>Corruptio optimi est pes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sima.</hi>
And that being the highest Court, over which no other
hath Jurisdiction, when 'tis misinformed, or misgoverned, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is left without all Remedy.</p>
               <p>But I have done, I forgive all the world, all and every of those
bitter Enemies which have persecuted me; And humbly desire
to be forgiven of God first, and then of every man. And so I
heartily desire you to joyn in prayer with me.</p>

               <p>O Eternal God, and Merciful Father, look down upon me in

pleased to try me to the uttermost, I most humbly beseech thee,
give me now in this great instance, full patience, proportionable
comfort, and a heart ready to die for thine honor, the Kings hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and this Chuches preservation. And my zeal to these (far

and all incidents thereto) which is yet known to me in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
for which I come now to suffer: I say, in this particular of

O Lord, confound their designs, defeat and frustrate all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs

CHARACTER
OF ARCH-BISHOP
LAUD.</head>
            <p>THE Pregnancy of his Child-hood, promised the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of his Riper Years, and obliged his Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their Abilities to his Support; and Strangers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Expectation to his Encouragement: Some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
offering him great sums of money for his mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in his younger years, upon the bare security
of his arts, which paid them well in his more reduced age. None
more observant of Favour, none more mindful of Kindnesses, and
none more grateful for Civilities: He was so wise, as seldom to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
an Injury in the consequence of it; and so Noble, as ever to
remember Love in the return of it. His honest Parents conveighed
him an excellent temper, and that temper a brave spirit, which
had the advantage of his birth, a place at an equal distance from
the University, where he was to be a Scholar; and the Court,
where he was to be a Man: In the first of these, his Indefatigable
Industry, his Methodical Study, his Quick Apprehension, his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Memory, his Solid Judgment, his Active Fancy, his Grave and
Quick Countenance, his Sharp and Piercing Eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the partial Systems of <hi>Geneva,</hi> but freely conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
with the impartial Volumes of the Church Catholick. He
had an infallible apprehension of the Doctrine and Discipline,
and a deep insight into the interest of Christianity. This Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Soul conversed with the most knowing of all Judgments, to
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59370:142"/>
find the bottom of all Errors; and with the most judicious of his
own, to discern the grounds of all truth. He had his Eye to the
University to reduce it, when Head of Saint <hi>Iohns,</hi> on the lower
functions of the Church in his Pastoral charges, to reform them;
and upon the higher, when Dean of <hi>Glou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that search and judgment, that he found out the principles of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
that were true to the Church; of that faithfulness and
resolution, that amidst all discouragements he was true to them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
The Church-government, he found by many private-spirited-men
accommodated to their ease and interest, he adjusted to truth and
settlement; consulting not humors, which are uncertain as Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
but truth, which is certain as Eternity.</p>
            <p>Arch-bishop <hi>Abbots</hi> yield, and they will be pleased at last, was a
great miscarriage; Arch-bishop <hi>Lauds</hi> Resolve, for there is no end
of yielding, was great policy. His great reach in Government,
suitable to that Kings apprehensions, commended him to King
<hi>Iames;</hi> his vast ability and integrity to King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the Duke
of <hi>Buckingham;</hi> to the first whereof he was Privy-Councellor, to
the other a bosom friend; before both whom he laid the best re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
and Ideas of the English Government, as to things
and persons in several abstracts, of any man under heaven. I have
heard a States-man say, <hi>That none knew Ioints, Turnings, Flexures,
Interests of all Parties in Church or State, that were either to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
or suppressed, with the seasons and opportunities to do it, so well
as Doctor</hi> Laud.</p>
            <p>Discerning was his Fore-sight, compleat his Intelligence, exact
his Correspondence, quick his Dispatches, seasonable and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
his Sermons and Discourses, inquisitive and observing his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
His Instruments were able and knowing men, that were
faithful to the Church, as he was in <hi>Manwaring</hi> and <hi>Mountague</hi>'s
Case to them; <hi>Knowing well</hi> (as he wrote to my Lord of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
that discouragement would deter men of parts, whom incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might make serviceable.</hi> He knew no man better how to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
a Parliament, having a Catalogue of all the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
with their interest and inclination, in his eye: He understood
none more exactly what was to be discoursed and proposed to
them, having a clear apprehension of the several junctures and
tendencies of affairs. He entertained no thought but what was
publick in his breast, no man but was nobly spirited in his familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
Ever watchful he was of all opportunities to advance the
Churches honour.</p>

6. In her Universities, as the Statutes of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Priviledges
of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and his vast gifts of Oriental Books and Buildings,
and his vaster design for both; and as watchful against all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
to undermine it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Feoffees for Impropriations he laid aside, the Sabbatizing
and Predestinarian Controversies he silenced, the Licentious Press
he reduced, Dignities and Preferments he worthily filled up, Bribes
at Court he retrenched, no Interest, no Alliance could ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
an unworthy Person while he lived: <hi>Breed up your Children
well, and I will provide for them,</hi> was his saying to all his Relations.</p>
            <p>Many a man would be disobliged by his sternness at first view,
for whom, if deserving, he would afterwards contrive kindnesses
by after and unexpected favours. No place of experience did he
ever miss, none of employment did he ever decline: He would
never see Authority bafled, but ever wave all proceedings against
all offenders, or go through with them; his Prosecutions, as in
<hi>Leightons</hi> Case were close; his Observation of all circumstances,
as in <hi>Loncolns Wary;</hi> his Declaration of the Cases clear and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
as in <hi>Pryns, Bastwick,</hi> and <hi>Burtons;</hi> his Sentence milde and
compassionate, as in <hi>Wallers;</hi> his Resolution and Justice ever mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
way to his mercy, and his mercy crowning his Justice: Often
did he conferr with the ablest and most Orthodox Clergy, with
the most experienced and most observing and reserved Courtiers,
with the profoundest Lawyers, with the skillfullest and discreetest
Mechanicks; out of all whose opinions, the result was his most
exact Judgement in any Case that came before him at Court, or
at <hi>Lambeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The roughness of his nature sent most men discontented from
him; but so, that he would often of himself find ways and means
to sweeten such as had any worth again, when they looked for it.
Many were offended at his prudent zeal against the Jewish Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batism
in his government, who were very well satisfied with the
strictness of his observation of the Lords-day in his person. But
let one great man express another, Bishop <hi>Gauden,</hi> Arch-bishop
<hi>Laud,</hi> whose thoughts lye so much the more levelled to his brave
Sentiments, as his dignity did to his high place.</p>
            <p>As to his secret design of working up his Church by little and
little to a Romish conformity and captivity, I do not believe (saith
he) he had any such purpose or approved thought; because, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
his declared judgment and conscience, I find no secular policy
or interest which he could thereby gain, either private or publick,
but rather lose much of the greatness and freedom, which he and
other Bishops with the whole Church had; without which temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
no man in charity may be suspected to act contrary to so
clear convictions, so deliberate and declared determination of his
conscience and judgment in Religion, as the Arch-bishop expresses
in his very excellent Book. I am indeed prone to think, that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
he wished there could have been any fair close or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
between all Christian Churches (the same which many
grave and learned men have much desired.) And it may be his
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59370:143"/>
Lordship thought himself no unfit instrument to make way to so
great and good a work, considering the eminencies of parts, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and favour which he had. Happily he judged (as many learn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
and moderate men have) that in some things between Papist and
Protestant, differences are made wider, and kept more open, raw,
and sore then need be, by the private Pens and Passions of some
Men, and the Interests of some little Parties, whose partial Poli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties
really neglect the Publick and true Interest of the Catholick
Church, and Christian Religion; which consists much in Peace, as
well as in Purity; in Charity, as in Verity. He found that where
Papists were Silenced and Convinced in the more grand and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Disputes (that they are Novel, Partial, and Unconform to
Catholick Churches in ancient times) then he found they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
spirits, and contested afresh against the unreasonable Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
Violences and Immoderations of some professing to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants;
who to avoid Idolatry and Superstition, run to Sacriledge
and Rudeness in Religion, denying many things that are Just, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
Safe, True and Reasonable, meerly out of an (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Antipathy to Papists. Possibly the Arch-bishop, and some
other Bishops of his mind did rightly judge, that the giving an
Enemy fair play, by Just, Safe, and Honourable Concessions; was
not to yeild the conquest to him, but the most ready way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
him of his wickedness; when no honest yieldings could
help him any more, than they did endanger the true cause or cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of his Antagonist.</p>
            <p>For my part, I think the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was neither

to brand its Devotion or Liturgy with his <hi>tolerabiles ineptiae,</hi>
who knew not the temper of the Nation, requiring then not what
was absolutely best, but most conveniently good; and such not
only the Liturgy was, but those things which he calls <hi>Tolerable Toyes.</hi>
I having occasion to speak with him, he upon a time was pleased
to grant me access, and some freedom of speech with him; and
withal, asked me the opinion of the people of him: I told him,
they reported his Lordship endeavoured to betray the Church of
<hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Correspondency and Communion, he at
length very calmly and gravely thus Replyed, protesting with a
serious attestation of his integrity before Gods Omniscience, that
however he might mistake in the mean Method, yet he never had
other design than the Glory of God, the Service of his Majesty,
the good Order, Peace, and Decency of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
that he was so far from complying with Papists, in order to confirm
them in their errors, that he rather chose such Methods to advance
the honor of the Reformed Religion in <hi>England,</hi> as he believed
might soon silence the Cavils of fiercer Papists, induce the more
moderate Recusants to come in to us, as having less visible occasion
given them by needless Distances and Disputes to separate from
us; which he thought arose much from that popular variety, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy,
Easiness, Irreverence, and uncomeliness, which might
easily grow among us in the outward profession of Religion, for
want of observing such uniformity and decency in Religion, as
were required by the Laws and Cannons of this Church and
State. He added, that he had (further) a desire, as much as he
could, to relieve the poor and depressed condition of many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
which he had to his grief observed in <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>England,</hi>
where their discouragements were very great, by reason of the
Tenuity and Incompetency of their Livings: That in his Visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he had sometime seen it with grief, among twenty Ministers,
not one had so much as a decent Garment to put on, nor did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
their other Treatment of Life was better; that he found the
sordid and shameful Aspect of Religion and the Clergy, gave great
advantages to those that were Popishly inclined; who would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ever think it best for them to joyn with that Church, which did
not maintain either its own honor or the Clergy, to some compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
and comeliness.</p>
            <p>Much more discourses his Lordship was pleased to use at several
times to this purpose, which commands my charity to clear him,
as far as I can judge, of any tincture of Popery truly so called, or
of any Superstition, which placeth a Religion in the nature and
use of that thing which God hath not either particularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
or in general permitted. I suppose he thought, that
where God hath allowed to his Church, and to every private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
(so far as may consist with the Churches order and peace) a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59370:144"/>
of Ceremonious, and circumstantial Decency as to Gods
Worship; there neither he was to be blamed, nor did he blame
other men, if they kept within those discreet and inoffensive
bounds, which either the Churches publick peace required, or its
indulgence to promote Christians permitted.</p>
            <p>That uniformity he pressed was not more advantageous to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which must of necessity have been propagated, when Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
had been turned to Devotion, then it was necessary for
the State; which cannot be secure as long as there is a mark of
distinction, under which all male-contents may shrewd themselves;
a note of Separation, whereby the Factions may reckon their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and estimate their strength, and a way open to popularity, to
the ambition of any whose interest or desperateness shall adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to make himself head of so great a party.</p>
            <p>He was a person of so great abilities (which are the designations
of nature to dignity and command) that they raised him from low
beginnings to the highest office the Protestant profession acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
in the Church, and he was equal to it: His learning ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
eminent in his book against <hi>Fisher,</hi> and his piety illustrious
in his Diary. He was of so publick a spirit, that both the Church
and States have lasting Monuments of the virtuous use he made
of his Princes favour. At his admittance into which, he dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the future emoluments of it to the glory of God, and the
good of men, by a projection of many noble works, most of
which he accomplished, and had finished the rest, had not the fate
of the Nation checked the current of his design, and cut off the
course of his life. He was not contented by himself only to
serve his generation (for so he might appear more greedy of fame,
than desirous of the universal benefit) but he endeavoured to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all others as Heroick, if they aimed at a capacity for his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
for (I have heard it from his enemies) no great man was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a confidence and respect with him, unless he made address by
some act that was for the common good, or for the ornament and
glory of the Protestant Faith. Learned men had not a better
friend, nor Learning it self a greater advancer; he searched all
the Liberaries of <hi>Asia,</hi> and from several parts of the world pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
all the ornaments and helps of literature he could, that
the English Church might have (if possible) by his care, as many
advantages for knowledge, as almost all <hi>Europe</hi> did contribute to
the Grandeus of that <hi>Rome.</hi> The outward splendor of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
was not more his care, than their honor, by a grave and pious
Conversation. He would put them into a power of doing more
good, but was sore against their vices and vanities; he scorned a
private Treasure, and his friends were rather relieved, than raised
to any greatness by him in his election of friends; he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to the good and wise, and such as had both parts and desires
to profit.</p>
            <p>The Church had his closest embraces, if otherwise it happened,
their fraud, not his choice, deserved the blame. Both Papists and
Sectaries were equally his enemies, one party feared, and the other
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59370:145"/>
hated his vertues. Some censured his zeal for Discipline above
the patience of the Times: but his greatest unhappiness was, that
he lived in a Factious Age, and corrupt State, and under such a
Prince, whose vertues not admitting an in mediate approach for
Accusations, was to be wounded by those it caressed. But when
Faction and Malice are worn out by time, Posterity shall ingrave
him in the <hi>Albe</hi> of the most excellent Prelacy, the most indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Fathers of the Church, and the most injured Martyrs.
His bloud was accompanyed with some tears that fell from those
Eyes that expected a pleasure at his Death: and it had been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
with a general Mourning, had not the publick Miseries,
and the present Fears of Ruine exacted all the stock of grief for
other Objects. His very Enemy Sir <hi>Edward Deering</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
that let him die when he would, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would be his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,
and his Book against <hi>Fisher</hi> his <hi>Epitaph.</hi>

OF
Dr. ROGER MANWARING,
Lord Bishop of St. Davids.</head>
            <p>THE Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Exeter</hi> having nothing
to do, invented the Rack in the <hi>Tower,</hi> (therefore
called <hi>the Duke of</hi> Exeters <hi>Daughter</hi> to this day)
and this Bishop used to say, that he was troubled
with people, who if they were not employed about
him, were so idle, that they would have been a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to themselves. In purchases we value Houses at nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they turn to little Profit, and are kept up with a very great
Charge; This Bishop valued his Kindred and Extraction, though
as Noble as any in <hi>Cheshire,</hi> not much, because the bare honor of
them contributed little towards the maintenance of them; in
which respect he observed <hi>Feb.</hi> the third the first day he went
to School, as strictly as <hi>Nov.</hi> 9. the first day he came into the
world, owing to the first only his <hi>Being,</hi> to the other his being a
Man. He was much for Mothers Nursing their own Children,
alledging (from <hi>Caligula in Dio Cassius,</hi> who was of his Nurses
disposition, and not of his Parents, when he was as mischievous as
brutishness armed with power could make him) that as the Nurse
was who had the forming of his first <hi>Idea</hi>'s, and the moulding of
his first constitution, so the Child proved; and more against Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59370:145"/>
keeping their Children at home under their own tuition,
because private Education hardly raiseth Youths to that vigor,
freedom, and generosity of spirit, that a more publick doth;
where the Conversation goeth as far as the Instruction, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of School-fellows, beyond the Precepts of Schools-masters,

<hi>Iacobs</hi> Sheep, or the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> before the Teeming-woman.
<hi>Richard Norshall</hi> saith, <hi>Bale (de Scriptor. Brit. c. 7. n. 6.)</hi> left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
a Sett of Sermons for every day he was a Bishop, and <hi>R. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring</hi>
had a sett of Exercises for every day, he was a Scholar; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing himself, and hearing nothing from others of remark,
but what he writ down, (being as Dr. <hi>Harris</hi> said of Dr. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston,</hi>
a needless Ingrosser of other mens Notions) for he said he
had a good Memory if he did not trust it; and when he lost a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>the careless man</hi> (he said) <hi>made the thief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An habit of exactness in his smaller performances, rendred him
exact in those more considerable, he being careful of two things,
the setling of his voice, and his minde.</p>
            <p>The modern Jews have among others a form of Prayer, wherein
they bless God as well as for their vents of Ejection, as mouths for
their admission of nourishment. Mr. <hi>Manwaring,</hi> though very stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
to acquire Learing, was more curious to express it; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that small abilities well set off, out-go greater that want that
advantage. The composing of four witty Verses, recommended
him to that Eminent School whereof he was Scholar; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
of an ingenious and vigorous Oration gained him
that noble Lord, who thought it an honor (sit to be remembred in
an eminent part of the Parsonage-House he gave him) to be his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron.
His Critical skill in Greek and rational Head, preferred
him Fellow of the Colledge; and his discreet carriage, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
head, Chaplain to his Lord; in all which capacities his
performances were not gaudy, but proper, becoming, and always
equal usually, especially in Divinity, managing his Exercises with
a pleasing kinde of <hi>Magisterium Theologicum,</hi> to use the old phrase
of <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi> Being so full that it was not with him as it was
with some men; the Platonick year of whose dicourses being not
above three days long, in which term all the same matter returns
again. He might be called <hi>Good-luck,</hi> as his Name-sake <hi>R. Twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
was, because however unhappy in himself, yet he brought
good success to others, as two Worshipful Families can testifie
whithersoever he went, which made several Places and Persons
ambitious at the same time of his presence and service, good em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
suing for him as earnestly as others had done for good
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59370:146"/>
employments; though Locusts are generally devourers of all
food, yet some Locusts, as those of St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> are wholsom, though
course food themselves; most troubles are losses, yet this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans
very losses were gains, in that, as he said, they made him
better acquainted with himself, and better known to others.</p>
            <p>Three things he was much resolved on, the Redemption of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
the Converting of Recusants, and the undeceiving of the
seduced Sectaries; and three Dyaries he kept, one for the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of his own Life, another for the publick Affairs of the
Church and Kingdom, and a third for the most remarkable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of Providence that hapned in the world. Many rich per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
he effectually exhorted to good Works, much Alms, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
Collected; his charitable Collections he carefully
preserved, and discr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

want; but as he said, of the Primitive Oblations, to incourage
virtue, keeping a Discipline, as he would say, all charitable people

their wandring life are under none. (<hi>as mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

by his Company, which at the same time improved his parts and

Beggars, as he was pittiful in relieving impotent and unfortunate

the King said, what wilt thou give for the place? Not a <hi>Penny</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered

with the improvement of the Vicarage and the Church. <q>Nay,

with great overtures for my self, but to treat with me upon fair

Church-men, his punctal dealing with the Cathedral; his good
usage to the subordinate Tenants, and good House-keeping; that as
he had got his Lease easily, he would keep house on the Church-patrimony

true of over-charged Tenants, <hi>They can scarce afford to feed their

his subject; the other a smooth man, that got in the bottom of
his Hearers hearts; whose discourse went off plausibly in the ayr
of his good delivery, though they passed not so well in the steady

direct his Counsel, and make Laws and Subjects, if they cannot
exhibite active obedience, in case the thing commanded should
be against the Law of God, or of nature, or were impossible,
yet nevertheless they ought to yield a passive obedience, and in
all other cases they are bound to active obedience, the time the
loan was pressed by the King, and so much disgusted by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            </p>
            <p>It was liked so well by those that heard it, that they would have
it Printed, and so ill by Arch-bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> when he read it, that he
would not License it.</p>
            <p>But it seems that Sermon that was not approved of by the Arch-bishop,
was not so much as questioned by the Parliament, which
found so much the more fault in the <hi>man,</hi> as they found the less
fault in the Sermon, which vexed them grievously, since they could
not but be angry at it, and could not punish it, it being smart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their late courses, yet cautious within their standing Laws.</p>
            <p>But being an active man (and if he had any fault, it was too
much heat) he doth not only assert the doctrine of the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
and the Subjects, but he suppresseth the impugners of it,
complaining with Dr. <hi>Lamb,</hi> even of the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> against
the Loan to the Council-board, and pursuing that complaint in
<hi>Star-chamber.</hi> But the best jest is, that those very people that found
fault with this Sermon, made it a Branch of their Articles against
Arch-bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> that he blotted several passages (about Sabbath-breaking,
Evil Counsellors, Popery, which they say the Doctor
had cunningly interwoven into his discourse, to sweeeen the harsh
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:59370:149"/>
point of the Prerogative) out of that Sermon; when indeed that
Sermon came out with so much care on all sides, that the King
commanded four Bishops to view and judge it, and every passage
in it.</p>
            <p>All the preferment that he had was his Vicarage of <hi>Brackley,</hi>
and a poor Prebends of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> though so deserving of the
Church in that Diocess, that Dr. <hi>Iohn Towers,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi>
in a Letter to my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> wished him as heartily in the
Deanery, as he did himself in the Pallace.</p>
            <p>It may be some that were in the Historians Character, <hi>sola so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia

and calling honest men in <hi>Livies</hi> phrase, <hi>Spiritus magni magis

ingenious person.</p>
            <p>Its not for superiors to frown upon, and brow-beat those who
are hearty, and exact in the management of their Ministry; and
with a grave and insignificant Nod, to call a well-regulated and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
zeal, want of prudence and moderation; such discourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of men in the way of an active conformity to the Church, is to
crack the sinews of Government; for it weakens the hands, and
damps the spirit of the obedient. And if only scorn and rebuke
shall attend men for asserting the Churches dignity, many will
chuse rather to neglect their duty in the Churches service, only to
be rewarded with that, that shall break their hearts too.</p>
            <p>That very little he had got in the time of peace, he lost in the
time of war; their practices and designs had been a long time the
subject of his smart reproofs, and his estate now become a prey to
their revenge. To see the good man escape them in his Clarks ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
that had been certainly murthered in his own; when it was
safe to be any thing but a Minister: and withal, to hear the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
man smile out his old Motto, <q>I have as much as I desire, if I
have as much as I want; and I have as much as the most, if I
have as much as I desire.</q> 'Twas a spectacle that had melted any
spirit, but that in which the custom of cruelty had taken away
the conscience of it; whom yet he was very tender of, according
to his usual Maxim, <q>Nature may induce me to shew so much
care of my self, as to look to my adversaries; reason shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade

who had heard of the extream age of one dwelling not far off,
made a journey to visit him, and finding an aged person in the
the Chymney corner, addressed himself to him with admiration
of his age, till his mistake was rectified so (Oh Sir, said the young

Primitive History, wherein he was so versed, that he had not

sin, as to spare the person, and yet so discreetly tender
towards the person, as not to countenance sin. A man that would
not give his heart the lie with his tongue, by not intending what
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59370:150"/>
he spoke, or his tongue the lie with his actions, by not performing
what he promised; that had rather friendly insinuate mens er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
to themselves, than detractingly blaze them to others: a man
that would not put off his Devotion for want of leisure, nor his
Charity for want of Ability; that thought it better to deny a
request, for that was onely <hi>discourtesie</hi> than not to perform a
promise, for that is <hi>injury;</hi> that would not rebuke, as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
would beat his servant in anger; angry reproofs being like
scalding potions, that work being to be done with compassion ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than passion. Many excellent books were dedicated to him,
its pity but there should be an intire book made of him.</p>

            <p>THeir good Friend, who told Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> when he saw what
his and other mens indulgence to dissenting persons
was like to come to, that he was ashamed to live,
when he should have nothing left him, but to live;

them against Government, for whom he and others
had so often interceded for moderation from the Government,
to see the most irreligious things done, under the pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:

Controversies in the Schools, offered expedients in Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
decided the Debates of Synods, (his prudent directions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpositions,
seasonable and obliging Authority contributing
much to the peaceable end of that Convention) governed Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,

1639. and the design of it upon our Coast, which he did
discreetly and narrowly, discovering more than we could suspect.</p>
            <p>And 8. For a Companion to the Queen Mother of <hi>France,</hi> when
she departed from <hi>England,</hi> in which capacity he was to his dying
day very serviceable to her, and to his Majesty, contributing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

He subscribed with the rest of the Nobility 12000<hi>l.</hi> and sent more

estate, or at least a very severe Composition, had he not discreetly
setled it in Sir <hi>Richard Onslow,</hi> and other Trustees, who had done
as signal Services for that which they called a Parliament, as he
had done for his Majesty.</p>
            <p>A Noble man this, made up rather of that honesty, that desires
rather to be, than to seem good, than of that hypocrisie, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
rather to be, than to seem good; one that made his business
more to deserve opinion than have it; as more concerned what
thoughts he himself, than what others had of him. He understood
the Religion he professed, and professed the Religion he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
he never thought himself so good as he should be, unless
he strived to be better than he was; equal in all conditions, under
the worst, patient, because he deserved it; and despaired not as long
as he could pray; under the best sober and thankful, because he
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:59370:153"/>
feared it, and presumed not as long as he might <hi>offend.</hi> Support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself and friends with this consideration, that if things are
not so good as he would they should have been, yet they were not
so bad as he knew they might have been: what if I am not so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
as I desire? its well I am not so wretched as I deserve.</p>
            <p>They say Favourites are Court-dyals, whereon all look when
Majesty shines on them, and none when it is night with them. Our
Nobleman was most conspicious in his Eclipses, and like the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius, Quod abesset co magius persulgebat.</hi> Though
always in favour, because entertained for use, not affection; not
only relying so much on his Masters favour, as his Master did on
his abilities: Goodness consecrated his greatness, and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
honored his goodness; he managed his estate so as to support
his honor, and employed his honor so as both to support and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
his estate; good husbandry may stand with great h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and noble, with no loss to his honor, travelling to gain experience

Religion, overthrew all Government. 5. Such male-contents, as
either lost the preferment they had, or had not what they were
ambitions of, with their kindreds and dependants. 6. Lawyers,
that second any attempt upon the Prerogative, with their Cases,
Records, and Antiquities. 7. <hi>London</hi> Merchants, that had been

for the Queen and the State. And 9. Such Recusants as were
Hispaniolized, whereof this Earl was none; but though as a

<hi>Ploiden</hi> died at <hi>London:</hi> the very reason why his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
recommended so earnestly, and he embraced so
willingly, the study of the Law, than which no study
more knotty, he would say to the Novices that were first admitted
to it, none more pleasant to the Ancients that had experience in
it; wherein he profited, as he might have done in any profession,
since very happy in those two qualities, Secrecy and Celerity, the
two great wheels of considerable performances; improving faster
than fame, the wings of industry surprizing men beyond those of
fame. His deterity in Logick in the University, promised him an
able Pleader at the Inns of Court. It was his observation, that
the fashioning of a Mans Head, to the minute subtilties of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phism,
opened and fitted it to entertain the distinct, and least cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of a Case. He wore a signet Ring, wherein was Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

Alsricanus</hi> did that which carried his Fathers Face, which was
taken off by the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> because he was unworthy to
wear his Fathers Portaiture, that did not follow his Pattern; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not fit his Picture should go without his Virtue.</p>
            <p>One part of his time he spent with his Acquaintance, and the
other with his Books; the one bringing him to practice, as the
other enabled him for it.</p>
            <p>He studied the <hi>English</hi> Nobility and Gentry for his pleasure, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
their Alliance in Heraldry, and for his profit noting their
correspondence in Interest; being as able to put suitable Persons
together to make a Party, as any Herald was to put Kindred toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to frame a Pedigree. His Study was like his Converse, rather
well contrived than toilsom, his Art, not his Drudgery; his soft
and fair, went far in <hi>Labyrintho properantes ipsa velocit as Implicat.
He is not the likeliest man to run out of a Maze, that runs fastest.</hi> He
was as rich in his observations of his own age (no remark being
missed in his Table-book) as he was in his <hi>History of Former Ages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Happy in himself, more in his Relations, especially those he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his Blessings (as if peculiar to him) his good Wife, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59370:155"/>
Children, of whom he was loving, not fond. One point of
his devotion was remarkable, that he never met a person subject
to infirmities, but in stead of deriding them in the other man, he
blessed God that he had not occasion to grieve for them in himself.
And another of his instructions to those about him notable, that
its not the least, a man skillful to have so much command of him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
self, as to be contented to submit to the commands of others.</p>
            <p>The Courtesies he bestowed, were gifts never remembred by
him; those he received, loans never forgotten: The Discourse
he loved, was that which had left of other mens vices, and most
of their virtues, without censure of Superiors, scorn of Inferiors,
vain-glory, or a supercilious reservednesse (when men are rather
Riddles than Company) in the persons themselves.</p>
            <p>Liberal he was of every thing, especially of good advice; cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
of doing good: He would hardly receive an ill opinion of
any, and more hardly expresse it. He dispensed Justice to his
friends, not as a friend, but as a friend; answering, when it was told
him, that that was not the way to be rich, That it would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
him for being the poorer for doing justice.</p>
            <p>He neither incouraged an ill-inclined person by overmuch
mildnesse, nor discouraged a well-inclined one by extream seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>He could pardon a man that he caught in a mistake, for it was a
common frailty, commending in him the acknowledgment of it as
a great virtue [the noblest thing that St. <hi>Augustine</hi> did was his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation] but reject him that stood in it as a hopelesse wretch; a
man he called not constant, but obstinate; it being more to justifie
a fault, than to fall into it. His Apparel was neither mimically in
fashion, nor ridiculously out; neither vain, nor singular.</p>
            <p>His short divertisement fitted him for business, rather than rob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bed
him of time; he would say to his Sons, <hi>That they who make
recreation a business, will think business a toil.</hi> To be without an
estate, and not want; to want, and not desire; to manage well a
great estate, and to bear a mean; to be sensible and patient, not
to grow great by corruption, nor to grow proud with greatnesse;
not to ebbe and flow with a mans condition, and to be neither su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious
nor dejected; to take the changes of the world, without
any change in a mans self; not to defer death, but sweeten it; to
be neither loath to leave the world, nor afraid to give account for
it, were qualities that he admired in others, and lived to be Master
of himself.</p>
            <p>He never commended a man to his face, but before others, to
create in them a good opinion of him; nor dispraised any man
behind his back, but to himself, to work in him a reformation of
himself; avoiding the appearance of evil, left he should do ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares,
or hear ill undeservedly.</p>
            <p>He could not with patience hear what was unseasonable or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savory,
arguing want of goodnesse or judgment; <hi>Speak well,</hi> was
his rule, <hi>or say nothing; so if others be not bettered by thy silence, they
will not be worse by the discourse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:59370:156"/>
Being more intent upon knowing himself, than letting others
know him; he found that the greatest part of what he knew not,
was the least of what he knew. He was as careful that others
should be bettered by him, as that he should be bettered by others;
observing little but what he would imitate, and doing nothing but
what might be imitated.</p>
            <p>In the Morning he thought what he had to do, for which he
might ask Gods blessing; and at Night what he had done, for which
he must needs ask pardon; being ready always to part with and
give account for his life; not being afraid to look upon his score,
but fearful to increase it. To despair, because a man is sinful, is to
be worse, because he hath been bad. To be discontented he reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
a folly, because it makes that which was a punishment only
before, a sin now; and by finding fault with God, to make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fault in our selves. He neither made another mans fault his
own by aggravating it, nor doubled his own by excusing it.</p>
            <p>These virtues of his Person, the great reputation of his Parts
and Skill, the eminency of his Practise, and his known Integrity,
preferred him to a relation to many Noble Persons, and at last to
the Service of the Crown: for having been some years Barrister of
<hi>Grayes Inne,</hi> and called, with fifteen more, to be Serjeant, <hi>Term. Mich.
Anno</hi> 21. <hi>Iacobi Regis,</hi> being Puisne to them all; insomuch, that
it was remarkable at that time,<note place="margin">☞</note> that he read in <hi>Grayes Inne,</hi> after he
had received his Writ to be Serjeant, which was done by the advice
of the Lord Chancellor and the Judges; he was made the Queens
Serjeant the next Term, I. <hi>Car.</hi> and upon the death of Sir <hi>Francis
Harvey,</hi> one of the Justices of the Commons Bench. Wherein,
with what impartiality he administred Justice to the people, and
with what faithfulnesse he gave advice to the King, especially in
the matter of Ship-money, may be guessed by his sufferings from
the Faction, and his love from the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Which (since we could not be so happy, as to have an account
of this excellent Father from his excellent Son; who is as well
his Character, as his Child; his History, as well as his Issue:) we
must be contented to take from a friend of his, who would have
Posterity know him, to whom they are so much obliged.</p>

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Mr. JOSIAS SHUTE.</head>
            <p>HIS very name is as a Silver Trumpet to his Reputation,
sounding out a <hi>Quicquid doctiorum est, assurgite huic tam
colendo nomini:</hi> With whom it was, as with <hi>Iob</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 29. The young men hid themselves, and the
aged rose and stood up; when the Ear heard him, then it blessed
him; and when the Eye saw him, it gave witness to him. His
name I say, is an Aromatick Oyntment, diffusing a more rich Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume,
then the choicest of our broken Boxes.</p>
            <p>2. He descended of a Learned Race, the Son of an eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
in <hi>York-shire,</hi> and one of five famous Brother-Preachers. A man
of that latitude of Learning, that length of Apprehension, that
depth of Judgment, and height of Speculation, so compleat in all
Dimensions, that I may justly renew that admiration of <hi>Naz.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Basil,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, where was there such a mixture of rare
Parts and Graces: What kind of Learning was he unacquainted
with? what kind was he not Excellent in? as if he had studied
that alone.</p>
            <p>3. And though he were a man of but a single heart, yet was he
one of divers Tongues, able to read the Scriptures without the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
of Translators; he both drank and derived those Holy
Waters out of their sweeter Fountains, the Originals. And even
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59370:157"/>
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledges, the Original is in several cases to be
used. <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> valued their Skill in the Originals
above Kingdoms, faith <hi>Amam</hi> in <hi>Paraen. L. H.</hi> Our grave Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
like a wise Merchant, was well skill'd in the Tongue of the
place he traded to; being Master of those three Grand Mother-Languages
inscribed on the Cross of Christ, besides some others
of their Progeny.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Filius Ecclesiae in patribus versatissimus:</hi> This Son of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> was most familiar with the Ancient Fathers
both of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West.</hi> Of the Greek, <hi>Chrysostom</hi> lay in his
bosom, even till he did <hi>Patrizare,</hi> become like unto him in his
flowing strife and golden Eloquence. Among the Latine, St.
<hi>Augustine,</hi> that Maul of Hereticks, was in chief esteem with
him.</p>
            <p>5. He was an exact Historian, for Ecclesiastical History espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
those Records of the Church; the ignorance whereof is
the Mother of many of our growing Errors and Indevotions, nor
was he less acquainted with the Schools; (though more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the waters of <hi>Siloah,</hi> than of <hi>Meriba,</hi>) even a Master of
the Master of the Sentences, and a <hi>Secretioribus</hi> unto the Councils,
even of their Cabinet.</p>
            <p>6. And because the flock is not only to be fed, but cured some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
he was a singular Casuist, and Chyrurgeon, that knew well
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to set in joynt again, and to binde up the broken heart:
A Soul-Chyrurgeon right, for all those properties of heart, and
hand, &amp; eye, no less sweet and soft in exhortations &amp; consolations:
He was indeed another <hi>Apollos,</hi> an Eloquent man, and mighty in the
Scriptures; and as another <hi>Basil,</hi> he did thunder in his Doctrine,
and lighten in his Life, his light shined before men; not only that
of knowledge, but that of example also in his Piety and Charity,
in his Gravity and sweet Affability.</p>
            <p>He guilded not over Luke-warmness with the Varnish of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
nor allowed he violence in unconcerning and indifferent
Affairs, under the pretence of zeal.</p>

St. <hi>Mary Woolnoth</hi> in <hi>Lumbard-street London,</hi> an indefatigable,
most faithful, and most beloved Preacher of the Gospel there;
lamenting the distractions fallen upon the Church, he departed
hence to rest with God, <hi>Iune</hi> 22. 1643.</p>
            <p>He was born in <hi>Gislewick</hi> in <hi>York-shire,</hi> and bred in <hi>Trinity Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and afterwards became Minister of St. <hi>Mary
Woolnoth in London,</hi> and was, Reader, I do say, and will maintain it,
the most precious Jewel that was ever shewn or seen in <hi>Lumbard-street;</hi>
all Ministers are Gods <hi>Husband-men,</hi> but some of them can
only plough in <hi>soft ground,</hi> whose <hi>shares and coultres</hi> will turn edge
in a hard point of Divinity: no ground came amiss to Mr. <hi>Shute,</hi>
whether his Text did lead him to Controversial or positive Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
having a strain without straining for it of native Eloquence,
like the <hi>Paracelsian,</hi> who could draw Oil out of the slints of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies.

He <hi>spake</hi> that which others <hi>studied</hi> for: he was for many
years, and that most justly, highly esteemed of his Parish, till in
the beginning of our late Civil Wars some began to neglect him,
distasting wholsome Meat well dressed by him, meerly because
their mouths were out of taste, by that general distemper, which
in his time was but an <hi>Ague,</hi> afterwards turned to a <hi>Feaver,</hi> and
since is turned to a <hi>Frensie</hi> in our Nation.</p>
            <p>I insist thereon the rather for the comfort of such godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
who now suffer in the same nature wherein Mr. <hi>Shute</hi> did
before: indeed no Servant of God can <hi>simply</hi> and <hi>directly</hi> comfort
himself in the offerings of others, (as which hath something of
envy therein) yet may he do it <hi>consequently</hi> in this respect, because
thereby he apprehends his own condition herein consistent with
Gods love and his own Salvation, seeing other precious Saints
taste with him of the same affliction, as many godly Ministers do
now-a-days, whose <hi>sickles</hi> are now <hi>hung up</hi> as useless, and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

them, that the one may not do you harm by an ill habit, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>others</hi> by an ill example.</p>
            <p>It was his own comfort that he was inwardly sincere, and others
benefit that he was outwardly exemplary; his discourse wherein
he would neither undertake nor talk much, was rather profitable
than curious, not for applause to hear well, but for use to do
well.</p>
            <p>He asserted the utmost of Christian Liberty (being sensible with
<hi>Cardan,</hi> that there was no Superstition so dangerous, as theirs that
avoided Superstition) but practised the least of it, not going to the
farthest point of lawfulness because (as the <hi>East</hi> &amp; <hi>West-Indies</hi> meet
in a point) that lay upon the borders of unlawfulness, and he that
will do all that he may, may do what he ought not; he measured
his promises by his ability, and his performances, though to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
by his promises; an honest man doth not promise more
than he means, nor a wise-man more than he is able, though a
great Scholar: his greatest knowledge he reckoned that of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
and though an able man, yet valued it his greatest ability that
he conquered himself: he did good as privately as others do evil.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59370:158"/>
Good counsel, like charity, begins at home, he that will do good
upon others, must be good himself, otherwise it is an easier matter
to give good counsel, than to follow it.</p>
            <p>He would condemn nothing out of humor, nor maintain any
thing out of fashion; because, he said, he desired to say nothing
that he must recall, and to do nothing that he should repent.</p>
            <p>He deferred not the duty he durst not deny, because he recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
his life by moments, the minute past being irrecoverable, and
that to come uncertain, the present only ours: The more men
delay repentance, the more work they have to do, and the less
time to do it in; his last hour therefore finding him rather willing
to go than contented to carry, having nothing to do but to dye.</p>
            <p>He would not suffer us to measure our want of goodness by
others store, nor our store of it by others want; for the crooked
must be measured by the streight, and not by the more crooked;
teaching us to measure Gods blessings, not by our wants, but by
our deserts.</p>
            <p>He did not wonder at the various effects of the doctrine he
taught, any more than at the divers effects of the Physick he would
sometimes prescribe, (and he would say that a <hi>good Divine</hi> should
have something in him of the <hi>good Physician)</hi> both succeeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the capacity of the Patient; for under unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
we should blame not Gods means, but our own hearts; when
we profit, we should not thank our own hearts, but God and his
means. The way to be long young, is to be old betimes (he said)
and the way to live always, was to dye daily; the thoughts of the
dissolution of soul and body, which is the natural death, being
the best means to prevent the dissolution of soul and body, which
is the spiritual death; and death becomes the beginning of a mans
happiness, and not the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Consideration</hi> was the main part of his work, and he would have
made it the main part of ours; all the evils in the world, he would
say, being capable of a prevention by these two words, <hi>quid foci?</hi>
And by that which as it was the peculiar faculty, so was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
happiness of a man. <hi>Reflexion,</hi> and suffering <hi>reason</hi> to check and
controul the Appetite, and <hi>faith</hi> to govern reason, when urged
much with his stiffness in the points of Obedience and Rebellion.
If I did not think these doctrines true (said he) I would never have
published them? and since I think they are true, I dare not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them: Which puts us in mind of his smart check to Back-sliders;
If the profession of Religion was not good, why did you
enter into it? if it was, why do you not continue in it?</p>
            <p>It was an endless thing, he thought, to be solicitous about fame,
for that lies in the power of many; a short work to take care of
Conscience, for that is in the power of one. Upon some good
words bestowed on him by the men of the times, that heard ill, he
startled with, <hi>Why? what have I done, that these should speak well of
me? Parcat cognatis maculis similis fera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let thy estate serve thy occasions (it was his last words to his
Brother) thy occasions, thy self; thy self, thy soul; thy soul, thy
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:59370:159"/>To take <hi>Resolution</hi> (he urged us to) upon good grounds, and not
to forsake them, but upon good reason; prescribing to us a solid
judgment, and not fond opinions; and if we maintain opinions,
to do it because they are true; and not, because they are ours.
Christian Liberty he asserted, and Christian Licentiousness he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed.</p>
            <p>He would satisfie Nature, and not humor it; stand still, rather
than go out of his Calling; flow to chuse a friend, and slower to
change him; courteous to all, intimate with a few (saying, our
Saviour had many Hearers, but a few Disciples) his acquainted, he
reckoned his neighbor; his friend, himself; he scorned no man
for his meanness, nor humored any for their wealth; advising
young men not to cease to be good Christians, by desiring to be
esteemed good Companions. In stead of a <hi>Cato,</hi> set before thee, said
he, to Mr. <hi>I. S.</hi> set before thee a <hi>God,</hi> whose eye is always upon thee,
and therefore keep thy eye always upon him; doing nothing to
which thou mayest willingly desire Gods absence, or canst not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
his assistance.</p>
            <p>He was very earnest with us, to keep this much upon our hearts,
that the good we receive is not for our own sake, nor the good we
do by our own power. He was unwilling that we should repine
at sufferings, as other mens faults, if they be not blessings, it is our
own: He saw his own mortality in other mens death, and his own
frailty in their sins; so thinking of death, as to be afraid of sin
that led to worse; and so reflecting on sins, as not to be afraid of
death that led to better. He charged us in the beginning of the
times, to make not the best men our rule, for they that in all things
follow him that may err, will be sure in some things to fall into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
He compared what he did, with what he suffered, being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
taken with this consideration, that he had received more
good than he had done, and done more evil than he suffered.</p>
            <p>Often repeating to us the saying (as he did recommend to us
the solid and safe works) of Bishop <hi>Davenant,</hi> in an Emphatical
Prayer, which he made for half a quarter of an hour before he
died, reserving (that strength which standers by thought he had
lost, when for many days he had not spoke, though not speechless)
for his last hour, wherein he thanked God for that his fatherly
correction, because in all his life time he never had one heavy affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which made him often much suspect with himself, whether
he was a true Child of God or no, till that his last sickness.</p>
            <p>If I have lived well, I have lived long enough, would he say, to
those that were impatient to hear that he should dye; if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
too long; to desire to be here still, is to desire to be still out
of heaven. Child, would he say to a friend, never think it too
soon to be serious, for it may be too late to put off amendment:
with hope of living is to loose eternal life, by presuming on a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
one. In the beginning of the troubles he much inculcated
that rule that we should intend the publick good, as well as our
private advantages, because by providing for a mans own particular
he may wrong the publick, whereas by effecting good to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59370:159"/>
a man must do good to himself; whence all creatures do
that as <hi>more</hi> good, which is good to the <hi>more;</hi> measuring good not
by what it is in it as to us, but by what it is in its self. He thought
he should not fear death the last change, that was acquainted with
a life so full of changes.</p>
            <p>Its pity, he would say to Ladies that came to him, that Beauty
which is an ornament, should become a snare; the worst money is
that which is spent about fashions, and the worse time (more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than money) that is employed in Dressing, since God hath
made you beautiful in others eyes, let it be your care to be so in
his.</p>
            <p>At Church he wished them to empty themselves of this world,
to be conversant in the next; to shut their eyes, that their ears
might be open.</p>
            <p>In Neighborhood he would wish them, to love others as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in the kind <hi>unseigned;</hi> in Friendship to love others as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in the degree <hi>ardently.</hi> Injuries shew that thou art able to
revenge, but not willing (lest thou do that injury by incroaching
on him to God, which thou complainest of in thy Neighbour:)
courtesies shew thou art willing to requite, though not able; if
you live not for your selves, but to God; God will not live for
himself, but for you. Let your conceit be low, and your desires
high, God being able to render your capacity as great, as you know
your worth is little.</p>
            <p>He would unwillingly converse with a man that would forget
himself by an unreasonable anger, or his friend and company by
an unseasonable jest.</p>
            <p>He loved his Body, which he had common with a Beast, in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
to his Soul, which he had common with Christ. His
words, which were few, went far in his house, but his example
further; being, he said, angry for small faults, to prevent greater;
and pleased with the least good, to encourage men to do better.
He would hear no ill of a friend, nor speak any of an enemy; his
rule being, tell nothing of another, that thou wouldst not have
told him.</p>
            <p>He would come to free Entertainments, and to costly ones; to
hospitable, but provident Tables, where that was thought too
much for him, that was too much for his friends estate, saying, he is
not a friend that expects more than a man is able, and he is not his
own friend that doth less; do all like your selves, so that you
weaken not your self, nor your estate.</p>
            <p>Company, he said, like Climates altered<note n="a" place="margin">With the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

hard for a good man not to be the worse for bad company, and for bad
company to be the better for a good man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The poor were sure of relief in his Vestry or House, since it
was his common saying, that we cannot with comfort call upon
God for our daily Bread, if we denied his poor, that called upon
us for our daily Crumbs.</p>
            <p>He had in every Sermon, something that suited every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
from the highest to the lowest, and in every Prayer,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59370:160"/>
something that suited with every want; his arrows hit where he
did not aim, as the Bell clinketh to the foolish as he thinketh; so
a Sermon soundeth to a mans ear according to his heart.</p>

Nurseries, wherein young, raw, and unexperienced men, that
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59370:160"/>
could not continue in the University under Learned Tutors and
Governors, might finde an University in the Country under
grave and sober Pastors, gaining that stock of Learning and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
in business, by the direction and example of wise-men
upon <hi>their Charges,</hi> which they might lay out upon <hi>their own:</hi>
               </hi> he
found happiness in this world as they that study the Philosophers-Stone,
without any desire to finde it: he was neither stupidly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Affairs of the world, nor scornfully regardless of his
concerns in it, but submissively contented with Gods allotment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about
it. The <hi>French</hi> are said to have so graceful a behavior, that
all postures that they are in, and all attire that they put on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
them; this good man became any condition, and every
condition became him, <hi>as if he had been born to that alone.</hi> Others
affected a more high way of talking than he (which he compared
to a Kites high-flying in the Air, that would yet vouchsafe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
to a Carrion upon the ground) but he continued in a
higher way of living than they; being happy in an humble height
whereby he did <hi>truly,</hi> what the Emperor is said <hi>Ironically</hi> to do, <hi>viz.
descendere in Coelum,</hi> he could not indure to hear men tell their
friends what others said ill of men behinde their backs, it being
all one as to go and tell a man what is said of him when he is dead.
Let your <hi>prayers</hi> (he would say) <hi>be as frequent as your wants,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His. Advice.</note> and
your thanksgiving as your <hi>blessings,</hi> miss not the <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi>
in publick, unless you have no <hi>sins</hi> to <hi>repent,</hi> or no care to
be <hi>forgiven them:</hi> Think not the worse of the Ordinance of God
for the sins of the Administrator; those that are ill themselves,
may through Gods blessing (that is not confined to the person,
but to the thing) be Instruments of good to others. It was our
Saviours rule, <hi>Do as they say:</hi> the Stone sheweth the way that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stir in it, and the Bell calleth others to Church that heareth
not it self. A sickly Physician may <hi>Cure,</hi> and a loose Divine may
<hi>Save,</hi> acquaint your selves rather with Gods Commandments than
his Decrees, and conclude thy Salvation rather from a diligent
observing of Gods Revealed will, than a curious search into his
secret one.</p>
            <p>When people pleaded Conscience for known sin, he would say,
It was sad when the greatest restraining from sin was the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to it, and tell them their Conscience was not their <hi>rule,</hi> but
their guide, so far only can Conscience <hi>justifie</hi> our actions as it is
its self <hi>justified</hi> by his word.</p>
            <p>He was to the last, he said, contented to live, and yet desirous to
dye; his little saying he called it, was, let it be your first care to
be good to your selves, and your next, to make others so. Let it
trouble you more to do a fault than to hear of it, being more sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that it is true, than that it is known; never think to be free from
censures, or faulty, while thy Neighbors and thy self are but
men.</p>
            <p>He was the man that received no Opinion upon Credit, and vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
none upon Discontent, embracing Doctrines that might save,
rather than fancies that might raise him: Speaking what he
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59370:161"/>
thought, not what others (though good men, yet but men) said;
who, he said, should be his Copies no longer than they agreed with
the Original. The man that entertained whatever God sent
<hi>thankfully,</hi> and did whatever God commanded <hi>chearfully,</hi> that spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
no mans sins for the persons sake, nor reflected on no mans
person for his sins sake; <hi rend="margQuotes">That feared more to do ill, than to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it: the Author of this rule, fear to do any thing against that
God whom thou lovest, and thou wilt not love to do any thing
against that God whom thou fearest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He did not easily entertain Friendship with a man without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Acquaintance, nor easily part with a Friend he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
without a very great fault: he would say that he must
have no friend, that would have a friend with no fault.</p>
            <p>Every man, though his Adversary, was his Neighbor that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him.</p>
            <p>How much pleased was he to hear another commended! how
much more, if he had occasion to commend him himself: the first
he would do without repining, and the second without detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>He forgave many that he said he must reprove, because shewing
them their fault, was instructing them in their duty; never lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a man the less for an injury, though trusting him less, being
throughly satisfied when the party was throughly sorry. It was,
he said, common to him with God to suffer injuries, to exercise
his patience, therefore it should be proper to him as it was to God
to forgive them, to exercise his Charity. In fine, a good man he
was, without noise; a provident man, without perplexity, merry
without lightness, grave without morosity, bountiful without
waste.</p>
            <p>These and many other his good virtues, recommended him first
to <hi>Hornsey</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> and his faithfulness and success there open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his way to St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> the Great in <hi>London,</hi> as his prudence
and gravity did to the Arch-Deaconry of S. <hi>Albans</hi> in <hi>Hertford-shire,</hi>
and his worthy mannagement of these inferior Places and Offices,
purchased to him the good degree of a Bishoprick, and that at
<hi>Bristol,</hi> which was offered him <hi>Anno</hi> 1616. to <hi>maintain</hi> him, and
then refused by him; because, he said, he wanted not subsistence:

Episcopacy wanted such a devout and well-reputed man to

Sermon at a Visitation upon this Text, <hi>For</hi> Sions <hi>sake I will not
hold my peace;</hi> he used often the story of Mr. <hi>Dods</hi> being strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
moved at midnight without any reason in the world to visit
a Neighbor, to whom when he said he was come, but knew not
why, the Neighbor answered; <hi>You know not why you came, but God
doth that sent you; for I was but just now under a temptation to make
away my self;</hi> and he applied it thus, that he would never go to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit
any out of Complement but Conscience, looking up to God
that he might bless his presence in the Family whether he went to
rebuke the temptations any of the people thereof might lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
As he made not that wearisom which should be welcome by
the tediousness of his Sermons, never standing above his Glass
(which he said was Mr. <hi>Robert Boltons</hi> way) nor keeping a Glass
unless upon an extraordinary occasion above a quarter of an hour,
so he made not that common which should be precious by the
courseness, or cursoriness of them; he never offered God or his
people what cost him nothing, being (unless surprized to an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi>
performance, for which he desires to be rather excused
than commended) of <hi>Demosthenes</hi> his minde, who never spoke
what he had not studied, being wont to say, <hi>That he shewed how he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
and reverenced the people of</hi> Athens, <hi>because he was careful what
he spake to them;</hi> desiring to admire rather than imitate them who
made preaching their nature, and could discourse Sermons. It
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59370:162"/>
cost him as much pains to set his own Sermon on his heart (that
he might speak to the hearts of the people) as it did to get them
into his head: he that speaks from his belly (called <hi>Ventri loquus)</hi>
seems to be another at further distance which whispers; and when
a man speaketh from the heart, the speech seems to come from
one at distance, and that is God.</p>
            <p>He kept up all Ordinances, Prayers, Sermons, and Sacraments
in equal esteem, as <hi>Scipio</hi> in a Controversie between two who
should have the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aling Crown due to him that first climbed the
walls, gives it to them both, knowing that they both got up the
wall together.</p>
            <p>Especially taking care of Catechizing (priding him self as much
as <hi>Luther</hi> did in this Character, <hi>Discipulus Catechismi)</hi> that men stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying
the dark corners of Divinity, might not lose themselves in
the beaten Road of it; looking upon Catechizing as the way of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling
Religion at first, and maintaining it still.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour is observed not to preach against Idolatry, Usury,

               </gap> breaking, among the Jews, because not so dangerous in an
age wherein, saith one, <hi>Iniquity was spun with a finer thred:</hi> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
spiritual pride and hypocrisie; this his Servant connived
not at Debauchery, the confessed, bewailed, and lamented sins of
one part of the Nation, but was very severe against Sacriledge,
Disobedience, Curiosity, and Hypocrisie, the maintained sins of
the other: Mens Consciences, he said, flew in their faces for the
one, and would reform them, but their Consciences were made
parties for the other, and would <hi>harden</hi> them. Those sins he said
were to be preached against, that were grown into so much repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
as to be preached <hi>for:</hi> He looked upon it as equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to confute an old Heresie which time had confuted, and
to spend time in reproving those sins which every ones heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
him for. He <hi>read much,</hi> but orderly (drawing up his noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> used to do his men, not above six deep,
because he would not have them lie in useless Clusters, but so that
every particular might be drawn into Service;) but meditated
<hi>more,</hi> dispiriting his Books into himself. He was glad to go from
<hi>London</hi> to <hi>Bristol</hi> to avoid the tumults, but he was gladder to be
translated from <hi>Bristol</hi> to Heaven, quite heart-broken with the
Rebellion.</p>
            <p>He never, though almost fifty years a Preacher, went up a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
but as <hi>Luther</hi> said, he trembled; such an aw and reverence of
God was upon his heart: he preached but once before the King at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and he fainted; so great his modesty before men, that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Prince (under whom it was incouragement enough to be a
good Divine) speaking to the people to pray for him, for he said, <hi>It
might be any mans Case,</hi> and wishing him to retire, saying, he was
a good man, and he would with patience wait for him, as he did,
untill the good Bishop being a little refreshed, came up again and
preached the best Sermon, and the last that ever he made. What
good opinion the Parliament, as it was called, had of him, though
not over-fond of Bishops, appears by the insuing Order, which

him upon the examination of the end, bottom, ground, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstamces

the more vigorous prosecution of the noble design, and scope,

            </p>
            <p>His education happy, as he used to observe himself, in six things</p>
            <p>1. The example of a wise and good Father.</p>
            <p>2. The Learning and Experience of discreet and knowing Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
whom he mentioned with no less honor than <hi>Aristotle</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
by <hi>Alexander,</hi> who equalled him that gave him Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with his Father that gave him Being; or his Master, by <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi>
who gave him so honorable an Interment; or his Tutor, by
<hi>M. Antonius,</hi> who erected him a Statue; or <hi>Ausonius,</hi> by <hi>Gratian,</hi>
who made him Consul.</p>
            <p>3. Travel and Observation, which fixed those notions in his
minde, that lay so loose in others.</p>
            <p>4. Hardship and Patience, to which he was used in a way of
choice, when he travelled abroad; that he might use it in a way
of necessity, if there were occasion at home.</p>
            <p>5. Good and useful Company, generally above, seldom beneath
himself; knowing that gold in the same Pocket with silver, loseth
both of its colour and weight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:59370:168"/>
6. An Inquisitive Nature, not contented with the superficial
and narrow notions others acquiesced in, from Tradition and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
but with a large soul, enquiring after such an account of
things, as was derived immediately and genuinely from the nature
of the things themselves. Happy in observing that rule <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
remember to distrust, and wishing heartily for a systeme of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
gathered by observation and experience upon the systeme of
nature.</p>
            <p>The result of these and other advantages, was a competent skill
in Arts (especially Phylosophy, Mathematicks, Physick, and the two
parts belonging to it, Chirurgery and Botanism; or a great skill
and insight in Herbs and Flowers) and Arms; this accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him for <hi>publick Service,</hi> and the other being the satisfaction
and ornament of his <hi>private Life;</hi> the one being gained by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in the <hi>Low-Country</hi> Wars, where he learned in the time of
our peace, what rendred him serviceable in the time of our war;
the other by severe study, weighing observations and good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>His converse gave the world a singular pattern of harmless and
inoffensive mirth, of a nobleness, not made up of fine Cloaths and
Courtship; a sweetness and familiarity, that at once gained love,
and preserved respect; a grandeur and nobility safe in its own
worth, not needing to maintain it self by a jealous and morose di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
the confirmed goodness of his youth, not only guarding
his minde from the temptation to vice, but securing his same too
from the very suspition of it. So out-stripping in wisdom, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,
and fortitude, not only what others did, but even what
they wrote, being as good in <hi>reality</hi> as in <hi>pretence;</hi> to which he
added this unusual glory, that since there was but a small partition
between the Kings of <hi>Iuda's</hi> beds and the <hi>Altar,</hi> through which,
they said, <hi>David</hi> had a secret passage; arguing the nearness there
should be between Religion and Honor, and that the Crosse was an
ornament to the <hi>Crown,</hi> and much more to the <hi>Coronet;</hi> he sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
not himself with the bare exercise of <hi>Virtue,</hi> but he <hi>subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated</hi>
it, and made it <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he understood himself well, so he did his Estate, being taught
to manage it before he injoyed it; being none of those soft No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,
who if they were, as one was by his Father, to tell all the
money they spent, would as he did retrench their expences, that
they might save themselves a labour.</p>
            <p>Good Husbandry, as Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> said, was <hi>good Divinity,</hi> and
as this Nobleman practised it, <hi>good Nobility.</hi> Improving his Estate
to double the value of that on the other side the Hedge of it, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Those were not times for Noblemen to impoverish themselves, that
they might inrich their Tenants.</hi> Foreseeing greater occasions for
his Estate, than the superfluity of Hospitality, or the vanity of
many Followers, <hi>viz.</hi> the supplying of his Prince, the relieving of
worthy fellow Subjects, and an honorable provision for the several
very hopeful branches of his numerous Family. He raised his
Rents, as plenty of money in the kingdom raised Commodities,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:59370:168"/>
knowing that the humor of letting Rents stand still, as our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
left them, was but the ready way to be cast behinde in the
Estate we have, whilst all things we buy go on in <hi>price;</hi> his Rents
quickned, but did not gall his Tenants, his Inclosures without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>population;
which he detested were injurious to none, (the poor
having considerable allotments for their <hi>common-age,</hi> &amp; the free and
Lease-holders a proportionable share in the <hi>Inclosures)</hi> beneficial
to many. (The Monarch of one <hi>Acre</hi> which he may mould to his
own convenience, being likely to make more profit of it, than if
he had a share in <hi>forty)</hi> and consequently useful for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>And as much prudence we observe in his Education of his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as we did in the managing of his Estate, all of them like the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors, being bred to employments that may save, if
not improve their Estates and honor. It is a sad story which one
tells, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <hi rend="margQuotes">That when he was beyond Sea, and in a part of <hi>France</hi>
adjoyning to <hi>Artoise,</hi> he was invited often to the House of a
noble Personage, who was both a great Souldier and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Scholar; and one day above the rest, as we sate in an open
and goodly Gallery at <hi>Dinner,</hi> a young English Gentleman, who
desirous to travel, had been in <hi>Italy</hi> and many other places, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to come to this house; and (not so well furnished with
return home as was fitting) desired entertainment into his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
My Lord, who could speak as little English as my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man
<hi>French,</hi> bad him welcome, and demanded by me of him
what he could do: For I keep none (said he) but such as are
commended for some good quality or other, and I give them
good allowance; some an hundred, some sixty, some fifty Crowns
by the year: and calling some about him (very Gentlemen like,
as well in their behavior as Apparel; This (said he) rides and
breaks my great Horses, this is an excellent Lutinist, this a
good Painter and Surveyor of Land, this a passing Linguist and
Scholar, who instructeth my Sons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sir, (quoth the young
man) I am a Gentleman born, and can only attend you in your
Chamber, or wait upon your Lordship abroad. See (quoth <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Lignitor,</hi> so was his name) how your Gentry of <hi>England</hi> are
bred, that when they are, or want means, in a strange Countrey,
they are brought up neither to any quality to prefer them, nor
have they so much as the Latine Tongue to help themselves
withall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That worth he bred up his relations, to be loved and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced
in all men, being a great Patron of useful Learning and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,
that was either likely to be serviceable to the State or
Church; or honorable to the Persons that owned it.</p>
            <p>He was of opinion, that as some Physicians when they are posed
with a mongrel Disease, drive it on set purpose into a Feaver,
that so knowing the kinde of the Malady, they may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the <hi>Cure;</hi> so it would not be amiss to let the unreasonable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
of men whom nothing would satisfie (all concessions to
the tumultuary being like drink in a great heat, and likely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59370:169"/>
the thirst it should <hi>quench,</hi> break into open Rebellion, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
it more feizable to quench the fire when it blazeth out, than
when it smoked and smoothered. Accordingly, when his sober
advices would not be hearkened to in Parliament, he with other
young Noblemen, as Commissioners of Array, raised an Army in
the Northern Countries that might back them in the Field; but
being taken (as aforesaid) <hi>Oct.</hi> 23. 1642. at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Prisoner till <hi>Aug.</hi> 11. 1643. when he returned to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was extraordinarily welcome, the rather,
because he had made so good use of his Imprisonment (like the
Primitive Prisoners, converting his Goalers) that several Lords
and Gentlemen immediately followed him, being convinced by
him, that as long as they staid in <hi>London,</hi> they were in Chains as
well as he.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Oxford</hi> his Majesty liked his <hi>Proposals,</hi> as weighty and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
both in the Parliament there, whereof he was a Member, and
the Councel, whereof he was a great part: all men approved his
Expedients in order to an Accommodation, having a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
into the temper of those at <hi>London,</hi> and to the particular
ways at all times most likely to work with them. And none can
be ignorant of his dexterity in the several Commands he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
at <hi>Newbury,</hi> and <hi>Naseby,</hi> especially in both which places he
discovered a great reach in observing advantages, and a greater in
decoying the Enemy into them; being the steerage that day to
Sir <hi>Iacob Ashleyes</hi> Courage and Resolution, with whom he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Right-hand Reserve.</p>
            <p>His prudence was as intent in reconciling the differences at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
in order, the forming of an united strength against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as Providence is in accommodating the disagreements of the
Elements into a body that makes up the world.</p>
            <p>But when it pleased God, that the King and his Friends should
see that the best Cause was to be rendred glorious by great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats
and Misfortunes, rather than by great Victories; and when
the Kings Friends were divided in their Counsels as well as in
their Forces, wanting that Peace and Agreement, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Comfort, and Relief of the oppressed, and, <hi>which makes them
considerable, even when despoiled of Arms,</hi> by imputing (as it useth to
be in unhappy Councels) the Criminous part of their Misfortunes
to one another.</p>
            <p>When the Kings Overtures of Peace (that argued him equal to
himself under all the messages of ruines, from each corner of the
Nation like the fall of the dissolved world) though applauded by
the people that desired only Peace and Liberty, were neglected
by the Faction, who aimed at Conquest and Usurpation, and his
Majesty was forced in a disguise (an ominous Cloud before the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the Royal Sun) to engage his very Enemies by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Trust and Confidence in them; His Lordship, with the Duke
of <hi>Richmond,</hi> &amp;c. yielded up himself to the Army, which after a
considerable Imprisonment, admitted him in the years 46, 47, and

all things past the remedy of a Restauration, if the extream vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of some men had not been seasonally allayed and corrected
by the sober Applications and Interests of others. Heartily did

            <head>THE
Lives and Deaths
Of four Sufferers of
The Honorable House of RICHMOND.
I. Of the Right Honorable,
GEORGE Lord D'AUBIGNEY.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>XErxes</hi> viewing his vast Army from an high place all at
a sight, is said to weep at the thought, that within
an hundred years all those would be mowed down
with death. What man, having in one view the
great number of brave Persons that lost their Lives
in this War, can refrain the mingling of his tears
with their bloud? Certainly young State-reformers like young
Physicians, should with the first Fee for their practice, purchase a
new Church-yard.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Erasmus</hi> said of his Country-men the <hi>Germans,</hi> that I may
see of our party the Cavaliers, <hi>Nobiles habent pro hominibus,</hi> that
they had Noblemen, as thick as the other party had men. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that had the War lasted a little longer, the Ladies of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
must have been in the same condition with the Gentlewomen
in <hi>Champaigne</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who some 350. years since were forced to
marry Yeomen or Farmers, because all the Nobility in that Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet were slain in the Wars, in the two Voyages of King <hi>Lewis</hi> to
<hi>Palestine:</hi> and thereupon ever since by Custom and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Gentlewomen of <hi>Champaign</hi> and <hi>Brye,</hi> ennoble their
Husbands, and give them honor in marrying them, how mean so
ever before. <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Aubigney,</hi> younger Brother to the
Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> born 1615. in <hi>London,</hi> bred for the
most part in <hi>France,</hi> owing his Education to that Country, whence
he had that he was bred for, <hi>his Honor,</hi> the Lordship of <hi>Aubigny,</hi> a
Town and Seigniory, adorned with many priviledges, an ample
territory, and a beautiful Castle, in the Province of <hi>Berry</hi> in <hi>France;</hi>
bestowed by <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth, on <hi>Robert</hi> the second Son of <hi>Alan
Stuart,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lenox</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> for his many signal Services against
the <hi>English,</hi> and was till of late, and its hoped will be the honorary
title and possession of the second branch of that Noble and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Family, hence called by the name of Lords of <hi>Aubigny.</hi>

            <p>A Person whose life was nought else but serious preparations

Life and Death
OF
LUCIUS CARY,
Viscount Faulkland.</head>
            <p>A Brace of accomplished men, the Ornaments and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of their Country, which they served with no
less faithfulness and prudence in their Negotiations
abroad, than honor and justice in their Places at
home: Of such a stock of Reputation as might kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
a generous emulation in strangers, and a noble ambition in
those of their own Family. <hi>Henry Cary,</hi> Viscount <hi>Faulkland</hi> in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> Son to Sir <hi>Edward Cary,</hi> was born at <hi>Aldnam</hi> in <hi>Hertford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
being a most accomplished Gentleman, and a complete
Courtier. By King <hi>Iames</hi> he was appointed Lord Deputy of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and well discharged his Trust therein: But an unruly Colt
will fume and chafe (though neither switch'd nor spur'd) meerly
because back'd. The Rebellious <hi>Irish</hi> will complain, only because
kept in subjection, though with never so much lenity; the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
why some hard speeches were passed on his Government
Some beginning to counterfeit his hand, he used to incorporate
the year of his age in a knot flourished beneath his name, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the day of his birth to himself. Thus by comparing the date
of the month with his own birth-day (unknown to such Forgers)
he not only discovered many false writings that were pass'd, but
also deterred dishonest Cheaters from attempting the like for the
future. He made use of Bishop <hi>Vshers</hi> interest while he was there,
as appears by the excellent speech the Bishop made for the Kings
Supply.</p>
            <p>Being recalled into <hi>England,</hi> he lived honorably in the County
aforesaid, untill by a sad casualty, he broke his leg on a stand in
<hi>Theobalds</hi> Park, and soon after dyed thereof. He marryed the

Life and Death
Of the most Illustrious
JAMES, Duke of RICHMOND.</head>
            <p>A Noble person, little understood, and therefore not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
described, modestly reserving himself from men,
when he sincerely approved himself unto God.</p>
            <p>Great in his Ancestors honor, greater in his own

rather the <hi>worth,</hi> than the <hi>pomp</hi> of <hi>nobleness.</hi> Therefore his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
was his nature, not his craft; and his affableness, not a base
servile popularity, or ambitious insinuation; but the native gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
of his disposition, and his true valor of himself. He was

               </note> stranger to any thing worth knowing, but best acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with himself and in himself, rather with his weaknesses for Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than his abilities for Action. Hence he is not so forward in
the Traverses of War, as in Treaties of Peace, where his honor
enobled his Cause, and his moderation advanced it. He and my
Lord of <hi>Southampton,</hi> managing the several overtures of Peace, at
<hi>London, Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> with such honourable freedom and
prudence, that they were not more deservedly regarded by their

they were <hi>such,</hi> could not be patient till they were <hi>theirs,</hi> though
in vain; their Honors being impregnable, as well against the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59370:177"/>
kindness, as against their power. At Conferences, his conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were as solid as others judgments; his strict observation of
what was past, furnishing him for an happy guess of what was to
<hi>come;</hi> yet his opinion was neither variably unconstant, nor obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
immoveable, but framed to present occasions, wherein his
method was to begin a second advice from the failure of the first,
though he hated doubtful suspense when he might be resolute.
This one great defect was his good nature, that he could never
distrust, till it was dangerous to suspect; and he gave his <hi>Enemy</hi> so
much advantage, that he durst but own him for his <hi>Friend.</hi> One
thing he repented of, that he advised his Majesty to trust Duke
<hi>Hamilton</hi> his adversary, with the affairs of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in compliance
with the general opinion, rather than the Marquess <hi>Huntly</hi> his
friend, in compliance with his own real interest: An advice,
wherein his publick-spiritedness, superceded his particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns;
and his good nature, his prudence: So true it is, that the
honest man's single uprightness, works in him that confidence,
which oft times wrongs him, and gives advantage to the subtile,
while he rather pities their faithlessness, than repents of his credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
so great advantage have they, that look <hi>only</hi> what they <hi>may</hi>
do, over them that consider what they <hi>should</hi> do; and they that
observe only what is <hi>expedient,</hi> over them that judge only what is
<hi>lawful.</hi> Therefore when those that thought themselves wise, left
their sinking Soveraign, he stuck to his Person while he lived, to
his Body when dead, and to his Cause as long as he lived himself:
Attending the first resolutely, burying the second honorably, and
managing the third discreetly; undertaking without <hi>rashness,</hi> and
performing without <hi>fear;</hi> never <hi>seeking</hi> dangers, never <hi>avoiding</hi>
them. Although, when his friends were conquered by the Rebels,
he was conquered by himself; returning to that privacy where
he was <hi>guessed</hi> at, not <hi>known;</hi> where he <hi>saw</hi> the world <hi>unseen;</hi>
where he made yielding, conquest; where cheerful and unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in expectation, he provided for the worst, and hoped for the
best, in the constant exercise of that Religion, which he and his
maintained more effectually with their <hi>examples,</hi> than with their
<hi>Sword;</hi> doing as much good in encouraging the Orthodox by his

say of him as <hi>Macarius</hi> doth of <hi>Iustine;</hi> there was no vice but he
thought below him, and no virtue which he esteemed not his
duty, or his ornament. Neither was his prudence narrower than
his virtue, nor his virtue streighter than his fortune. His main
service was his inspection into the Intrigues and Reserves of the
<hi>Parliamentiers</hi> at <hi>Vxbridge,</hi> and his Cajoling of the <hi>Independants</hi> and
<hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> where the issue of his observation was, That the
King should, as far as his conscience could allow, comply with the
unreasonable desires of an unlimited ambition, to make it sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the evils that would flow from its own counsels; being
confident, as events have assured us, that the people would see the
inconvenience of their own wishes; and that they would return
that power which they sought for, but could not manage to its
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:59370:178"/>
proper place, before it became their ruin: For <hi>unbounded liberty</hi>
overthroweth its self. But alas! it was too late to grant them any
thing, who by having so much, were only encouraged more eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to desire what they knew the King in honor could not give: for
when a Prince is once rendred odious or contemptible, his <hi>indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
do him no less hurt</hi> than injuries.</p>
            <p>As his Services were great, so were his Recreations useful;
Hunting, that manly exercise, being both his pleasure and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment;
his accomplishment, I say, since it is in the list of
<hi>Machiavel</hi>'s Rules to his Prince, as not only the wholesomest and
cheapest diversion, both in relation to himself and his people, but
the best Tutor to Horseman-ship, Stratagems, and Situations, by
which he may afterwards place an Army; whatever Sir <hi>Philip Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi>'s
apprehension was, who used to say, <hi>Next Hunting, he liked
Hawking worst.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His other Brothers died in the Field, vindicating his Majesties
Cause, and he pined away in his house mourning for his Majesties
Person; whom he would have died<note n="a" place="margin">He with the Earls of <hi>Lindsey</hi> and <hi>Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyn,</hi> offering themselves to dye for his Majesty, hav<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing been the instruments of his commands, and it being, a Maxime, <hi>that the King can do no wrong, he doing all things by his Ministers.</hi>
               </note> for, and when that could
not be, died with his innocent temper, having rendred him the
Kings Bosom Friend, as his conscience made him his Good Subject.</p>

As to come nearer our selves, there were at one time in
<hi>England,</hi> three Kings Sons, six Dukes, eight Earls, and fourteen
Lords Sons in Holy Orders.</p>
            <p>Time was, when Abbies and Monasteries were an easie out-let
for the Nobility and Gentry of this Land to dispose of their
younger Children; that Son who had not mettal enough to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
a <hi>sword,</hi> might have <hi>meekness</hi> enough to wear a Cowle. Clap
a vail on the head of a younger daughter (especially if she were
superannuated, not overhandsome, melancholy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
she was provided for in a Nunnery, without cost or care of her
Parents.</p>
            <p>One eminent instance whereof we have in <hi>Ralph Nevil,</hi> first Earl
of <hi>Westmerland</hi> of that Family, whom we behold as the happiest
Subject of <hi>England</hi> since the Conquest, if either we account the
number of Children, or measure the heighth of honor they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to; for of nine Children he had by <hi>Margaret</hi> his first Wife,
Abbess of <hi>Barking;</hi> and a second, <hi>viz. Elizabeth,</hi> was a Nun: And
of a eleven by his Wife <hi>Ioan,</hi> one <hi>Iane</hi> was a Nun, all the other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
being Lords and Ladies, at that time, of the highest qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> 
               <hi rend="margQuotes">And no wonder (saith our Author) if our
Earls preferred their Daughters to be Nuns, seeing no King of
<hi>England</hi> since the Conquest had four Daughters living to womans
estate, but he disposed one of them to be a Votary; by the same
token that <hi>Bridget,</hi> the fourth Daughter of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
fourth, was a Nun at <hi>Dartford</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> the last English Princess
that entred into a Religious Order.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Who was born in <hi>London,</hi> 1609. and bred, when a Child, not as
those, who in point of judgment are never to be of age, but only
able in pleasures; but as he would say, <hi>In those Arts whereby a man
might be good Company to himself;</hi> for his honorable Relations per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
in him more than ordinary natural perfections, were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to bestow on him Education in piety, and Learning suitable to
his high Birth; he meeting their care with his towardliness, being
apt to take fire and blaze, at the least spark of instruction put into
him.</p>
            <p>The sharpness of Winter (correcting the rankness of the earth)
cause the more healthful and fruitful Summers; so the strictness
of his breeding compacted his soul to the greater patience and
piety; which with other virtues and abilities raised him to so
much reputation in the Court and University of <hi>Paris,</hi> that he was
preferred Canon of <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> 1641. Lord Abbot of in
<hi>France,</hi> a place worth 1200<hi>l.</hi> a year 1643/4. and was in nomination
for a Cardinals dignity, upon the inthronization of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi>
the tenth, 1644/5. as appears by this passage in a Letter.</p>
            <q>My Lord <hi>Aubigney</hi> is now made an Abbot, the Queen of
<hi>France</hi> hath given him one worth 2400. Pistols <hi>per annum;</hi>

            <p>Therefore in his discourses with Ladies, he used to urge to them
the advantage they had to reform a deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the women in <hi>Ludovicus Vives,</hi> who so reclaimed a loose
City, by vouchsafing none their favors but the virtuous, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of whose soul (since the soul wears all the beauties of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
contracted in it, as <hi>Aaron</hi> did all the glories of the world em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidred
upon him) answered to that of their own bodies, as Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds
and Pearls do to rich Cabinets and Pearls.</p>
            <p>And now I speak of souls, his good soul slept not in the body,
affording only now and then some glimmerings of common sence
and reason, but sparkled briskly, being to a stupid world, a great
argument of the Deity it worshipped; <hi>Hoc nempe habuit argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
divinitatis suae quod illam divina delectaverint; nec ut alienis inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
sed ut suis.</hi> Sen.</p>
            <p>And indeed, he used to say, that he much questioned the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,
and consequently the state of that soul, that besides the
exemplariness and communion of publick devotion, did not use
to retire to the intimacy of that more private, consisting chiefly in
these great parts. 1. Self-examination, consideration, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
soliloquies; for which in every place he resided, he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a Closet, dressed, as his breast for holy and serious thoughts,
pleasantly, yet dark scituated and furnished with two things; the
matters of his <hi>Devotion</hi> and of his <hi>Charity</hi> (wherein he expended
the thrid part of his revenue yearly, in such a way, that it was
almes to the poor <hi>souls,</hi> as well as relief to the distrested <hi>bodies</hi>)
which he esteemed the life, because the effect and the expensive
tryal of his devotion; and this Closet he consecrated into a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Chappel, by his solemn entrance into it never without a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
The words of his friend, <hi>(He taking it for a certain argument,
that the serious belief of a God, and of the World to come, is much wanting
in his heart, who dares be nought, idle, or sinfully merry, if he can but
get out of mans sight and congnizance;)</hi> which office he kept as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
on his servent heart, as ever the people of God of old kept
up the continual Burnt-offering upon the <hi>Altar;</hi> making as much
conscience of laying out his time, as he did of expending his
estate.</p>
            <p>And the result of all these accomplishments was,</p>
            <p>1. A moderate and tender spirit towards all sorts of Christians,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59370:180"/>
expressing himself to several Ministers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
with such a latitude, that upon the principle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

might have held communion with them, and they with him; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
his discourses with this, <hi>That he approved not a nice, scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and uncharitable religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. A great reverence to himself, being as much afraid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
his divine soul in any mean office, as<note n="a" place="margin">Senec. de benef. <hi>l. 3. c.</hi> 36.</note>

            <p>His education such, that he learned to pray as soon as
he could speak; and to read, as soon as he could pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <q>Horrori fuit Ingenium.</q>
            <p>From a strict School, and able School-Master in the Country, he
was sent to a well-governed Colledge, and an excellent Tutor,
Mr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> (after Dr. <hi>Sanderson,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>)
of <hi>Lincoln</hi>-Colledge)
in <hi>Oxford;</hi> who put his young reason, by his judicious
and exact method, into such a frame, that (he would bless God for
it) he had a habit (which men of a superficial education, sleight,
immethodical thoughts, were strangers to) of considering matters
proposed to him leisurely and soberly, of recollecting the proper
circumstances of a business <hi>pertinently,</hi> of looking through so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phismes
and appearances <hi>discerningly,</hi> of searching into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome

comprehensive frame of thoughts, reasoning, and discourse.</p>
            <p>But (as youth not yet accustomed to dissembling, easily discloseth
its temper) he soon discovered by those rancounters which he had
with his School-fellows, and Fellow-pupils in the School and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as prolusions to those engagements he afterwards had in
the Field, that he was born for <hi>action,</hi> the life of a Man; rather

meditate upon the great things which former ages have done,

               <hi>Palatinate</hi> as Captain; where he gathered such
choice observations, principles, and maximes of war, that being
an eye-witness in the long Parliament (wherein he was chosen a
Member) of their dangerous proceedings (which he opposed
with strong reasonings in the House, and offered to contradict
against the Ringleaders of the Faction with his Sword and Life,
challenging several of them in <hi>Westminster-hall</hi>) he privately reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to countenance the Kings more just proceedings in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
giving order for providing Armes and Ammunition at his own
charge, and direction to secure and fortifie all such places as were
tenable in <hi>Sommersetshire, Wiltshire,</hi> and <hi>Devonshire,</hi> out of his own
experience, until he, Sir <hi>Bevill Greenvill,</hi> Sir <hi>Io. Stawell,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Nicholas Flanning,</hi> raised with their interest and arguments (Sir
<hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> pleading the Kings, at the Assizes, Sessions, and all
other publick meetings of the Country, that his eloquence had as
great success upon the wavering populacy, as his Armes had against
the most obstinate Rebels) a choice Army in the West (an instance
of what great concernment it was to keep the Militia in the
Crown, and not to separate the Sword from the Scepter) not to
make a war, as he declared to the Country, but to prevent it.
(Thus <hi>Caesar</hi> that fought best in his age, spake so too; and the
sharpness of his wit, was equal to that of his Sword.)</p>
            <p>With which Army the Marquiss of <hi>Hertford,</hi> then Commander
in Chief, with his direction, <hi>Aug.</hi> 3. 1643. defeated the Faction in
<hi>Sommersetshire,</hi> took <hi>Shepton-Mallet,</hi> cleared <hi>Dorsetshire,</hi> maintained
<hi>Sherburn,</hi> with such conduct and resolution, as daunted the men at
<hi>Westminster</hi> for two months; and <hi>Octob.</hi> 3. breaking through the
Besiegers, <hi>who thought</hi> (to use their own words) <hi>to put an end to the

war,</hi> if they could but take him, and one or two more men of so
considerable fortunes, valor, and conduct, as both raised, and kept
up the war.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>(non quaerendus erat quem eligerent, sed eligendus qui
eminebat)</hi> he was chosen Commander in Chief of the West, where
in half an year he got 40. Garrisons well <hi>maintained,</hi> 12000. men
well <hi>disciplined,</hi> 1000<hi>l.</hi> a month Contribution regularly <hi>setled,</hi>
above 400 old Officers, Souldiers, and Engineers out of the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> usefully <hi>employed:</hi> A <hi>Press</hi> to
Print Orders, Declarations, Messages, and other Books, to instruct
and undeceive the people. <hi>Prudently</hi> managed the Pen upon all
occasions, being wonderfully quick in clearing this great truth;
<hi>That his Majesty, and his Fellowers, had no other intention in this war
that they were necessitated to, than the defence of the Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Laws, the Liberty and property of the Subject; together with the
Priviledge of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by these ways prospered so well, but especially,</p>
            <p>1. By the choice of his Deputies and Officers, as curiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
other mens worth, as he carelesly undervalued his own,
being choice in his <hi>instruments,</hi> because he was so in his <hi>designs;</hi>
well knowing that <hi>great actions</hi> must be left to the management of
<hi>great souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By his <hi>Discipline</hi> of the Army, without which, Commanders
lead thronged Multitudes, and not Armies; and listed Routs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than Regiments; keeping his Souldiers men (that they might
not be conquered by their debaucheries first, and then by
their enemies) by moral instructions, enduring no <hi>Achan to trouble
his Camp;</hi> as well as making them <hi>Souldiers,</hi> that they might not
be to <hi>learn,</hi> when they were to <hi>perform</hi> their duty <hi>(Turpe est in arte

            <p>3. By his <hi>Pay</hi> to his followers, pinching himself to gratifie them,
knowing well what <hi>gelt</hi> could do, and what it was to keep back
from men the price of their bloud, making them hazard their
lives by Fight, to earn their pay; and by Famine, before they got
it. His three words were, <hi>Pay well, Command well,</hi> and <hi>Hang well.</hi>

and rewarding them; he never made scales of his Souldiers, when
they were dead, in taking Cities, nor Bridges of them when living, in
bestowing preferments, knowing that deserving persons are more

being a greater skill to ward off blows, than to give them; he was

observe him publishing Orders for the strict observation of the
Lords day, the incouragement of good Ministers and People
throughout his quarters; being very severe in these two Cases,
1. Rapines committed among the people. And 2. Prophaneness
against God, saying, <hi>That the scandal of his Souldiers should neither
draw the wrath of God upon his undertaking, nor enrage the Country
against his Cause.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these courses, I say, he prospered so (being so well placed (to
use <hi>Paterculus</hi> his words of <hi>Sejanus) in eo cum judicio Principis certa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hant

because an adversaries testimony of him. <q>Of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
there, that sided with the King against the Parliament,
Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> by his unwearied industry, and great reputation
among the people, had raised himself to the most considerable
heighth, until the Earl of <hi>Stamford</hi> coming to the West, raised
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:59370:182"/>
Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> from the Siege of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> with some disadvantage,
which yet the old Souldier made up again by a Parthian stratagem
of a feigned flight, entrapping most of the Earls men, and to
overthrowing the Parliament Forces, in so much that the Earl of
<hi>Stamford</hi> desired a truce for twenty days, which Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to, with a design, during the truce, to bring off Sir <hi>Iohn
Chadley,</hi> as he did so happily, that the Earl was forced to betake
himself to <hi>Exeter,</hi> the whole West, consisting of so many rich,
and flourishing Shires, being wholly at his Majesties devotion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And when Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> with the <hi>posse</hi> of twenty one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
came upon him, he managed Skirmishes and Retreats with so
much dexterity, that his very Flights conquered; for drawing Sir
<hi>William</hi> to the <hi>Devizes</hi> to Besiege it, and making as if he would
Treat about the yielding of that place; he contrived that he
should be surprized with an unexpected Party of Horse on the one
side, while he drew out upon him on the other, with such success,
that he defeated, scattered, and ruined him, beyond relief (the
Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> being told, when he would have advanced with his
sickly Army, to recover him, that he was past it) he himself running
for security, first to <hi>Bristol,</hi> and thence riding with a few Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for recruit to <hi>London;</hi> leaving the few Garrisons that party
had in those parts to Sir <hi>Ralphs</hi> mercy, who took five of them by
Assaults, and seven upon Surrendry, with three thousand Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
five thousand Armes, six Ships, with sixty four Peices of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in a fortnights time. He was excellent at contriving at the
Scaling of Walls, as his Souldiers were in executing; and yet
more excellent in taking hearts being so civil, even to the most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate,
that they chose rather to be conquered by him, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by others, ever detesting their bloudiness that came valiant
to strong Holds, and departing cruel thence, knowing no difference
either of <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Sex</hi> in their anger, though they did in their <hi>Lust;</hi>
only it is not be forgotten here, how this expert Commander loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the advantage of <hi>Lands-down,</hi> for want of Ammunition taught
his Souldiers to beat and boil <hi>Bed-cords</hi> to make Match of them.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Devizes,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph</hi> marched into <hi>Hampshire</hi> and <hi>Sussex,</hi>
facing <hi>Petworth,</hi> entring <hi>Midhurst,</hi> and at last sitting down before
<hi>Arundel</hi> Castle in the extreamest part of <hi>Suffex,</hi> which he carryed,
beating Col. <hi>Norton</hi> into <hi>Chichester,</hi> and wheeling off in spight of
the Enemy (that provoked him to fight with disadvantage among
lined Hedges and Thickets, where he saw many brave men lost to
no purpose at <hi>Cheriton-down)</hi> in appearance to <hi>Winchester,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to <hi>Basing,</hi> and so to <hi>Oxford,</hi> whence <hi>Anno</hi> 1645. we finde him
after the considerable Recruits he had left the King, advancing
Westwards, and besieging <hi>Taunton,</hi> where (when we have observed

progress into the <hi>West</hi> to understand the Countrey before he

by my Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> at <hi>Torrington,</hi> with 20000. where my Lord de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spairing
of breaking through them, drew out four or five Closes
off the Enemy, lining the hedges, and flanking his Foot with Horse,
who disputed every hedge first with the Dragoons, and then with
the Reserves, and at last with the whole body of the other Army,
pouring upon them Regiment upon Regiment; and when they
had lost the hedges, maintained the Barricadoes at the end of the
Town with push of Pike, and the Butt end of their Muskets, for
three hours; and when over-powred there, my Lord brought up
the Rear, and made good the retreat though his Horse was shot
under him; so that the Foot had time to pass over the adjoyning
River, and the Horse to guard them; my Lord making use of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Avenue in the Town, or near, to stop the Enemies Career;
whom, if his advice had been followed, he had surrounded and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
with their own Victory. <hi rend="margQuotes">And withdrawing to <hi>Cornwall</hi>

               <hi>Lastly, for your self, besides what is implyed to you in common with
others, you may be assured of such mediation to the Parliament on your
behalf, both from my self, and others; as for one whom for personal
worth, and many virtues, but especially for your care of, and moderation
towards the Country, we honor and esteem above any other of your party;
whose error (supposing you more swayed with Principles of Honor and
Conscience) we most pity, and whose happiness, so far as is consistent
with the publick welfare, we should delight in more than in your least
suffering.</hi>

            <p>HIs two great Actions, the one at <hi>Liscard,</hi> the other at <hi>Stratton,</hi>
cannot be better described than by an Eye-witness, whose
words are these, as he saith, out of a Manuscript corrected with
Sir <hi>Ralphs</hi> own hand, communicated to him by his Secretary Mr.
<hi>Tredus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Liscard,</hi> a little before the Fight began, the Kings party took
it into seasonable consideration, that seeing by the Commission the
Lord <hi>Mohun</hi> brought from <hi>Oxford</hi> four Persons <hi>(viz.</hi> the said Lord
<hi>Mohun,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn Berkley,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Ashburham)</hi>
were equally impowered in the managing of all Military matters:
and seeing such equality might prove inconvenient (which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
had been prevented with the extraordinary moderation of
all parties) in ordering a Battel, it was fittest to fix the Power in
one Chief, and general consent setled it in Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton.</hi> He
first gave order that publick prayers should be read in the Head of
every Squadron, and it was done accordingly; and the Enemy
observing it, did style it saying of Mass, as some of their Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
did afterwards confess. Then he caused the Foot to be
drawn in the best order they could, and placed a Forlorn of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers
in the little Inclosures, wringing them with the few Horse
and Dragoons he had. This done, two small Minion Drakes
speedily and secretly fetched from the Lord <hi>Mohun's</hi> House, were
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59370:184"/>
planted on a little Burrough within random-shot of the Enemy;
yet so, that they were covered out of their sight with small parties
of Horse about them. These concealed Minions were twice dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
with such success, that the Enemy quickly quitted their
ground; and all their Army being put into a Rout, the Kings
Forces had the Execution of them; which they performed very
sparingly, taking 1250. Prisoners, all their Canon and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and most of their Colours and Arms; and after publick
thanks, taking their repose at <hi>Liscard.</hi>

               <p>ON the Kings side, order was given to force the passage to the
top of the hill, by four several Avenues: the ascent was
deep and difficult; resolutely did his Majesties Forces get up, and
obstinately did the Enemy keep them down. The fight continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
doubtful, with many countenances of various events (from
four in the morning, till three in the afternoon) amongst which
most remarkable, the smart charge made by <hi>M. G. Chudleigh,</hi> with
a stand of Pikes on Sir <hi>Bevile Greenvil,</hi> who fell nobly himself, and
had lost his Squadron, had not Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> (now Lord <hi>Berkley,</hi> who
led up the Musqueteers on each side of Sir <hi>Bevil)</hi> seasonably relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it, so resolutely re-inforcing the Charge, that Major General
<hi>Chudleigh,</hi> was taken Prisoner. Betwixt three and four of the
Clock, the Commanders of the Kings Forces, who embraced those
four several ways of ascent, met to their mutual joy almost on the
top of the hill, which the routed Enemy <hi>confusedly</hi> forsook. In
this service, though they were Assailants, they lost very few men,
and no considerable Officer, killing of the Enemy about three
hundred, and taking seventeen hundred Prisoners, all their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
(being thirteen pieces of Brass Ordnance) and Ammunition
(seventy Barrels of Powder) with a Magazine of Bisket and other
Provision proportionable. For this Victory, publick Prayer and
Thanksgiving was made on the hill; then the Army was disposed
of to improve their success to the best advantage. Nothing had
sunk his great spirit, but the fate of Kingdoms, with whose ruine
only he was contented to fall, and disbanded his Souldiers upon
honorable terms. Five things made my Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> so eminently
serviceable. 1. His great in-sight into the Designs, and prudent
fore-sight of the events of present Counsel, which when most
doubted and wavered, gave him that great resolution that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:59370:185"/>
great difficulties, and bore up against greater. 2. His expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of War in general, and his acquaintance with that seat of it
committed to him in particular. 3. His renown all over the
Kingdom for Piety and Moderation, and within his own associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Hospitality, Civility and Charity. 4. His Name among the
Enemies, as considerable for his Generousness and Justice, as for
his Valor and Conduct. 5. His Estate, that set him above Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinariness;
and his care for Money, that set his Souldiers above
need, the occasion of mutinying among themselves, or of incivil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities

1652. without any issue, besides those of his Soul, his great thoughts
and greater actions, his Barony of <hi>Stratton</hi> being coferred on the

<hi>Somerset-shire,</hi> so highly concerned with him in the Martial Affairs
of the <hi>West,</hi> (being one of them that reduced and commanded it)
he might well share with him the honor; and as Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> was
pleased that none but a King should succeed in her Throne when
dying, she said, <hi>My Throne is the Throne of Kings;</hi> so this Lords

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Sir EDMUND VERNEY.</head>
            <p>SIR <hi>Edmund Verney,</hi> whose Ancestor <hi>Iohn Verney,</hi> stands as
eminent in the Catalogue of Gentry made for <hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
in the twelfth year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, 1433. as he
doth in the Catalogue of Martyrs from 1637. to 1666. was
born, <hi>April</hi> 7. 1596. at <hi>London,</hi> bred most part of his time at Court
with an education answerable to his birth. 1. Under such a disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
as moulded his tender soul to that frame, that was not only
advantageous towards the succeeding part of his education, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the irregularity of his whole life. 2. Under that tuition
which successively instilled ingenious and good rudiments into his
tender breast, in the order that was proper to his tender years; Age
at once maturating his parts, enlarging his capacity, and advancing
his Lectures, until several years Education had accomplished his
minde with that stock of active, useful, and manly knowledge,
which furnished him with those vertues that are a perfection to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
natures, and a rest and tranquility to great minds. 1. Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and checking the irregular sallies of the inferior faculties, and
the impetuous passions incident to younger years. 2. Fashioning
his behaviour to that humanity that was due to mankind, and that
modesty and gravity, which was due to himself. 3. Regulating
his discourse to that temper, that became the product of judgment
and right reason, and raised him to thoughts of imployment wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and ingenuous, abhorring to busie himself vitiously or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently.</p>
            <p>In a word, when Education had made him a compleat man, he
bethought himself that he was born to labour, as the sparks are
made to fly upwards, being indued with that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> (as <hi>Iamblichus</hi>

with those abilities that suggested to him that he was not so far neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by either God or Nature, as to be placed in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
imployment. After sometime spent with my Lord <hi>Goring</hi> to see
the <hi>Low-Country</hi> Wars, and some sallies out with my Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi>
Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> to see the Courts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> 1618. he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with my Lord of <hi>Bristol</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> whence he returned so well
accomplished, as to be recommended to the service of the Prince;
where he as zealously opposed the plots and stratagems of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
in <hi>Spain,</hi> as his Tutors, <hi>Hackwell</hi> and <hi>Winniffe</hi> did in <hi>England;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>His Master, the Prince, disposing of Offices about him agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to mens inclinations; when King, made this stout man Knight-Marshal,
in which capacity he was severely honest in time of peace,
and undauntedly valiant in time of war; saying, when by his
place he held the Royal Standard at <hi>Nottingham, That by the grace
of God</hi> (his word always) <hi>they that would wrest that Standard from
his hand, must first wrest his soul from his body.</hi> And accordingly
at the battel of <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> Octob. 23. 1642. when as <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>
commanded his Standard to be thrown among his enemies, that
the Souldiers might be provoked in honor to fetch it; so he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
with his Majesties colours among the enemy, that the
Souldiers might be engaged to follow him, and was offered his
life by a throng of his enemies, upon condition he would deliver
the Standard; he answered, <hi>That his life was his own, and he could
dispose of it; but the Standard was his and their Soveraigns, and he
would not deliver it while he lived, and he hoped it would be rescued,</hi> as it
was, <hi>when he was dead;</hi> selling it, and his life, at the rate of sixteen
Gentlemen, which fell that day by his hand. One of the strictness
and piety of a Puritan, of the charity of a Papist, of the civility
of an English-man; whose family the King his Master would say,
<hi>was the model he would propose to the Gentlemen,</hi> whose carriage was
such, that he was called <hi>the only Courtier that was not complained of.</hi>
At the same time that he ventured his life for his Soveraign at

Life and Death
Of the Right Honorable,
SPENCER, Earl of NORTHAMPTON.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>SPencer Compton</hi> Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> Son to <hi>William</hi> the first
Earl of the Family, Created 1618. 16. <hi>Iac.</hi> by Sir <hi>Francis
Beaumont,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> Uncles Daughter, had
as many remarkables, as he said, in his life, as there were
years to his death. He was born at <hi>Compton</hi> in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi>
the very same day and hour that the Powder Traytors were
defeated at <hi>Dun-church</hi> in that County; an Omen, that that life (like
<hi>Caesars,</hi> who was born at the defeat of a Tumult) should be hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the suppressing of Rebellion, that was begun with the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of Treason. The first step he went by himself was to
reach the Kings Picture, and the first word he ever spoke was the
<hi>King,</hi> an argument he used upon his retirement, 1641. to those of
the party (that had so much as to understand worth, and making
advantage of his solitude for a temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

why, besides the impossibility of being a Neuter, he was
resolved to stand by the Soveraignty and Government of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, while he could either <hi>speak</hi> or <hi>stand;</hi> his parts were
so great, and his appetite to knowledge so large, that it was as much
as four several Tutors, at Home, at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> and
<hi>Italy,</hi> each taking his respective hour for the Art and Science he
professed, to keep pace with his great proficiency; the vigor of
his soul, advantaged by the strong constitution of his body, as that
was by the temperance of his dyer. I am informed, that in all his
life time, he took but one Antidote, and never purged but once,
and then the Physick found no obnoxious humor to work upon,
so healthful was his temper.</p>
            <p>The symbolizing of their sober and grave temperr, rendred him

many thousand people, did so much mischief, because of Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
in <hi>Warwick-shire, Northampton-shire,</hi> and <hi>Leicester-shire.</hi> He could
not endure jesting with Religion, there being no people of what
Religion soever, but had serious and great thoughts of their
<hi>Numen;</hi> nor an oath on any, except Judicial and Solemn occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
often repeating that of Prince <hi>Henry, That he knew no game

            <p>Having been so many years a witness of the Kings Majesties graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

upon the Faction breaking out of their shell upon the warmth
of the present peace and plenty, and peeping out of their privacy,
wherein like the Hedge-hogg they rounded themselves in their
prikcles without motion, &amp; took aim at the government; seeing the
contracts of the Nobility and tumults of the commonalty walking
formerly; so ugly they are in themselves with the borrowed face
of Religion, but now in the heat of their success casting off that
cloak, break out daily into outrages, as much against Policy as
Piety, as simple as scandalous; (the licentious having given reins
to their loosness, are not able to stop themselves) he not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
from their proceedings in all publick counsels, but prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to second that dissent with Arms, wherewith he was the best
furnished, when there was occasion to make use of them, of any
Nobleman in <hi>England;</hi> having settled his estate, and advanced se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
thousands towards the publick service, making the noblest
appearance 1639. against the Scots, and the most effectual provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
1642. against the English; waiting upon his Majesty to <hi>York,</hi> to
advise in the <hi>Ardua Regni,</hi> attest the clearness of his Majesties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedures,
and vow his assistance, as appears by his hand to several
publick Declarations from that place; from whence summoning
as many good Souldiers and honest Gentlemen, as were of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
the one to raise the Country, and the other to lead
and command by the untained reputation of his name, the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and sobriety of his principles, the exemplary regularity of
his person and family, the justice and generosity of his dealing
with his neighbors and dependants; the hospitality and almes of
his house, the sweetness of his spirit, amazed such a Body in <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick-shire,</hi>
as having seized on the Ordnance at <hi>Banbury,</hi> and

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Sir WILLIAM COMPTON.</head>
            <p>AN honorable person, of such temperance from his
youth, that he seemed to be the St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> of our
Church, of whom the report is, that when an Infant,
hanging on his Mothers breast, he fasted Wednesdays
and Fridays, and would not suck.</p>
            <p>He had no sooner accomplished himself by travel and study, but
his honorable Brother, before mentioned, intreats his Company
in his Expedition towards the settlement of the Association for
his Majesty in their Country, where he had an excellent faculty of
undeceiving those that wrested the Scripture by Scripture, his
Head being a Concordance, especially of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles; and
he advising it as very prudential, to condescend to level dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
at the capacity of the people, and to convince them in
their own dialect; having with him one who had the best com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of rain and sun-shine in his Face, to smile and weep at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
his tears flowing at will, melted the affections of many; though
others better acquainted with the man, no more regarded his
weeping, than they did the moist droppings of a stone-wall against
rainy weather.</p>
            <p>Small resistance he had (the disorderly people not knowing how
to digest themselves into a body, as who expects that a rolling
Snow-ball should have any curious fashion?) men at first only
fighting in a complement, until having bravely brought off his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
after three onsets (wherein his horse was twice shot under
him) by two Brigades of the enemy, it fell to his lot to be Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of <hi>Banbury,</hi> for the retaking whereof he had contributed so
much by his courage and counsel, where his first care was a civil
and strict carriage to win those <hi>professing</hi> people, disposing his men
so easily, paying for so honesty, and countenancing Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them so exemplarily, that the people of the place professed,
<hi>that if the Kings Army carried its self so in other places, they admired
with what conscience any godly man could lift up a hand against them;</hi>
and his next by his own <hi>industry</hi> (being in his turn upon all works
and watches, as well as the meanest man among them) and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to strengthen the Town, which by reason of its nearness to
<hi>Oxford,</hi> and its command over the adjoyning Counties, he resolved
to keep, as a place of very great consequence to the King, and aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59370:188"/>
at as of no less consequence to the other side, especially, since
his indefatigable way of Beating up Quarters, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whose men, some in their turns for three years together, were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

that admirable relief of <hi>Iackson</hi>) gathering Contributions, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming
the enemy) as troublesom at <hi>Banbury,</hi> as Colonel <hi>Massey</hi>
was at <hi>Glocester;</hi> the reason why, after some little attempts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
1644. the enemy came from <hi>Northampton</hi> with so many <hi>Miners</hi>
and <hi>Colliers,</hi> July 19. continuing their Mines till <hi>Aug.</hi> 27. on which
day it was assaulted by several Mines, Storms, and Batterings, with
a Summons, to which Sir <hi>William</hi> returned this answer, <hi>That they
kept the Castle for his Majesty, and as long as one man was left alive in
it, willed him not to expect to have it delivered.</hi>

            <p>And after several Batteries on three sides of the Castle, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

to drain the outmost Mote. Another, <hi>September</hi> 16. to which Sir
<hi>William</hi> returned this answer by the Trumpeter, <hi>That he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
answered them, and wondered they would send again:</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they proceed fiercely to their Assaults and Batteries, together
with their Granadoes, and great Ordnances (of the one 346. of
the other 767. for a week together) though answered with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Sallies, insomuch, that having made a breach upon the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall
of the outward of the Castle (the upper part near thirty
yards in length, but the inside wall lined with earth) they Storm it
about nine a clock in the morning, <hi>September</hi> 23. with six hundred
of their choicest men, twelve being picked out of each Company
with burdens on their backs to fill the Mote, falling on with Scale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ladders
in four several places, besides a great throng of them
in the Breach, but without effect, Sir <hi>William</hi> himself maintaining
the Breach, and giving order in all the other parts, so that they fell
off, desiring leave, after the Garrison had stripped them, to bury
their dead, especially, after the dreadful execution made upon them,
by a sally Sir <hi>William</hi> ordered upon them, under Leiutenant Colonel
<hi>Green</hi> the next day, when, with the men of <hi>Sechem,</hi> they were <hi>very
sore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And not long after, according to the good correspondence and
intellegence Sir <hi>William</hi> had with his Majesties Forces, the Siege
was raised by the right honorable the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> and Sir
<hi>Henry Gage</hi> on the one side, and himself on the other; the Besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
being dispersed, and their Carriages, Horses, three Waggons of
Armes and Ammunition, two Field-pieces, being taken and sent
into the Castle.</p>
            <p>A piece of service (considering that Sir <hi>William</hi> was not for a
eleven weeks in Bed, so great his vigilance; nor for a week off
the Works, so unwearied his diligence; that he had Prayers four
times every day, the spiritual armes seconding the temporal, so
eminent his piety, that he acted all things by common counsel and
consent, such his wariness and prudence: He countermined the
enemy a eleven times, and over-reached them by stratagems six
times, such his skill. He trusted no man without his own immediate

Life and Death
OF
Sir CHARLES COMPTON,</head>
            <p>TWin to Sir <hi>William</hi> in <hi>actions,</hi> as well as <hi>Birth;</hi> one
History serveth both, as well as did once one Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture:
Of whom one may say, as one did of his
Country <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> that it was the <hi>Heart,</hi> but
not the <hi>Core</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> having nothing Course
in his life, having had the same Education with
his Brother (saving that he excelled in two
great Accomplishments for Pleasure and Business, Musick and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59370:190"/>
without the first of which he would affirm that a man
was no Company; and without the second of no use.) He took to
the same War, being as eminent for Sobriety, Discipline, Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Conduct, Vigilance, and Activity in the field, where he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
as Colonel, as his Brother was in the Garrison where he
Commanded as Governor. There are two wonders in his life.
1. His surprize of <hi>Breston-Castle</hi> with six men, and himself by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to bring in Provision according to a Letter he intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(as he did many, reckoning his intelligence the main piece of
his service, and having always abroad his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
his many Eyes and Ears, as men of business must) which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
it the next Towns. 2. His having two Pistois clapped in
his very face, and yet neither fire, but the owners which were so
sure of his life, loosing by his side both their own.</p>
            <p>He was as much <hi>for</hi> Pasturage and Inclosures in his Country, as
his Brother was <hi>against</hi> them, answering those that complained,
Sheep turned Cannibals in <hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> eating up Men, Houses,
and Towns, their Pastures make such depopulation, <hi>That though
they make Houses the fewer in that Country, they made them the more in
the Kingdom; Towns being more peopled by Cloathing and Wool, than
the Country is depopulated by pasturage:</hi> Indeed (to use the words of
a modern Author in this Case;) <q>Corn doth visibly employ the
poor in the place where it groweth by Plowing, Sowing, Mowing
inning, threshing: but Wool invisibly maintaineth people at
many miles distance, by Carding, Spinning, Weaving, Dressing,
and Dying, so that <hi>Abel</hi> need not kill <hi>Cain;</hi> the Shepheard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
the Husbandman, but both subsist comfortably together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What service he did his Majesty and his Father during the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
we may guess by the trust reposed in him since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration;
his Prudence and Courage having been as effectual
against the late Usurpation, as the Ash of his Country (a stand of
which in Pikes in his Country mens hands, under his Conduct was
impregnable) is against viperous Creatures, of which it, is said that
a Serpent incircled with fire, and the boughs thereof will in this
Dilemma, put it self rather on the hazzard of fire, than adventure
on the fence of Ashen-boughs: but it is unhappy that he was like
that Ash too, of which it is written, that being cut down green, it
burneth clear and bright, as if the sap thereof had a fire-feeding
unctuousness therein.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman having measured his thoughts of Good and
Evil, by the respects of a transitory life, but with relation to an
eternal state, to which his life was in his esteem only a state of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
dyed (by an unhappy accident (a fall off his Horse at <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton</hi>)
a truly wise-man, <hi>that had not respect to a few things,</hi> the
least of any man needing that death-bed Repentance he used so
much to plead for of the opposite opinion, to which he would say
<hi rend="margQuotes">That it was a Tenent that would make heaven very empty; and
yet never the more room there for the maintainers of so uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
opinion:</hi> leaving this observation of the late Usurpation,

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Sir SPENCER COMPTON.</head>
            <p>A Fourth Brother of this Noble Family, of whom the
excellent Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi> in his Sermon upon his Parallel
Mr. <hi>Peito,</hi> delivered this Character at <hi>Chesterton,</hi> That
he was a Person so singularly qualified by Grace, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and Education, that however his extraction
was highly Noble, yet he thought he might confidently say it
was the lowest <hi>thing in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An happy Person, that from a due estimate of himself and this
world, arrived at just thoughts of his work in the world; and
finding his duty ingraven in his Being, lived as a man ought to do,
who being a middle person between those purely intellectual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
that could not injoy this world, and the purely sensual that
could not understand it, was pitched upon as the fittest creature to
inhabit this world, soberly injoying the comforts of it, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and devoutly reflecting on the Author of it.</p>
            <p>A Person that had just sentiments of the dignity of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in himself, and an universal Charity for it in others; one
that measured not the wisdom he studyed by the subtilty and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
of Speculation, by fineness of thoughts, depth of design,
but a Noble design to keep up the Dignity of Mankind, by a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
piety towards the first Being, by a sober and due govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his own actions; and a publick justice and kindness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all men, confining all thoughts of glory within the compass
of vertue; and being good, and thinking nothing more dishonora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than sin; and being bad, pitying those ruines of mankind that
had nothing about them but laughter and the shape of men, and
thought themselves then to act most like men, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
nearest beasts; and so hitting upon right Principles, lived
a great deal of life in a little time.</p>
            <p>When I consider how ingeniously upon the great principles of
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59370:191"/>
Reason and Religion, he would baffle those unhappy men, who
having betrayed their weakness, in giving themselves over to leud
courses, throw away that little wit in defending them! how suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully
would he reprove them, <hi>who,</hi> as he said, <hi>laughed themselves
into eternal misery,</hi> to this purpose: <hi>Ah! Sirs, it is easier to laugh at
goodness, than to practise it, it were worth the while to mock at sin, if
so we could annihilate it; and make it as well nothing in it self, as to
us. If the nature of things would so far vary with our humors, that
goodness would be less excellent by being despised, or sin less dangerous
by being thought so; urging them to name the man in all the Histories of
the world, to whom the very suspicion of evil was not a dishonor, though
the real guilt of it were now a glory.</hi> A discourse so much the more
effectual from him, because he prevented the common cavil made
against dehortation from sin, <hi>That it was only a thing some men live
by declaining against, and others cannot live without the practise;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as much by his virtue above the latter imputation, as he was by
his fortune above the first.</p>
            <p>What a vast progress he made through all solid and gentle
Learning, that was either for ornament or use; and what a great
proficiency in the experimental part of Religion, I cannot but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex
to his life those words, that being made perfect in a short time
<hi>Right honest,</hi> was to him a nobler title than <hi>Right Honorable;</hi> and
therefore he adhered to his Soveraign the closer, for that which
others deserted him, <hi>viz.</hi> his afflicted virtue; following the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
of that Court, the pleasures whereof he would have
avoided and been afraid of, chusing it, surely then, as the great
Scene of Virtue; for though his extraction was noble, his fortune
fair, his abilities great by nature, and greater by art and industry;
yet was his modesty and meekness so far beyond all these, that the
only vice we knew him guilty of, that he made it his business, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to hide, than to exercise his virtue. And those two virtues
(his modesty and his meekness) made him so swift to hear, so low
to speak, as appeared when he was pleased to express himself,
<hi>speaking much in</hi>

then at <hi>Bruges,</hi> when he died, 1659. as Dr. <hi>Morley,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Earles,</hi>
he raised himself upon his Pillow, and held out his armes, as if he
were to embrace one, saying, <hi>O my Iesus!</hi> and intimating the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts

Life and Death
OF
Mr. HENRY COMPTON.</head>
            <p>OUT of respect to the Right Honorable the Earl of
<hi>Northampton,</hi> I have put together the distant Lives
and Deaths of his three Brothers; and to keep on
in the name, I annex <hi>Henry Comptons,</hi> Son of Sir <hi>Henry
Compton</hi> of <hi>Surrey.</hi> I think the very same Sir <hi>Henry
Compton,</hi> of whom I find this Note in <hi>Haberdashers-hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Henry Compton</hi> of <hi>Brambleton,</hi> Com. <hi>Sussex,</hi> with 300<hi>l. per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi>
settled 1372 02 00</p>
            <p>A sober and a civil person this <hi>Henry Compton</hi> was, unhappy only
in bad Company, which are apt to ensnare good natures, that like
the good fellow Planet <hi>Mercury,</hi> is much swayed by neighbor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences.
No Company is uncomfortable (gladness its self would
grieve for want of one to express its self to joy, like heat looseth
strength for want of reflection) but bad Company is infectious,
unless a man had the art, when with them, not to be of them:
<hi rend="margQuotes">Like the River <hi>Dee</hi> in <hi>Merionith-shire,</hi> which running through
<hi>Pimblemcer,</hi> remains intire, and mingleth not her streams with the
water of the Lake.</hi> But it were Tyranny to trample on him for
those infirmities, he so often lay prostrate before God for, and
what God hath graciously forgotten, let no man despightfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="364" facs="tcp:59370:192"/>
His fall was as much the triumph of the Rebels, as his life was
their shame; doing even when Religion was nothing but dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
better than they could speak; his heart being better than
their very tongues.</p>
            <p>The occasion of his death was the same with that of the Nations
ruin, <hi>Iealousies,</hi> and a strange suspicion, that because a Lady, my
Lord <hi>Chandois</hi> Courted for him, his intire Friend and constant Bed-fellow,
had a greater kindness for my Lord himself, than for him;
that my Lord spoke two words for himself, for one he spoke for
him.</p>
            <p>Jealousie, the rage of this good man, that shot vipers through
his soul, not to be pacified with the arguments urged, the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
used, the protestations made, though the most rational, and
the best natured man living, after three days interposal, especially
upon some mad fellows suggesting to his relenting thoughts, <hi>That
it would be Childrens play to Challenge and not to Fight.</hi> How passion
diverts reason, and lust overcomes? and that unhallowed heat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Mistress, the more sacred respect towards a Friend,
through whose heart he must needs make a way to the other heart
that scorned him.</p>
            <p>Fond men, that undervalue themselves so much, as to kill a
man, that they may injoy the pleasures of a beast; fond hope, to
expect satisfaction in the injoyment of that person, whom we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see without a guilt, that will make a Bed of Doun a torment;
when each blush of the woman, puts in minde of the bloud shed
for her, when each embrace recollects the last parting of dearest
friends; when we cannot feel the wound love makes without a
greater, from the thoughts of that hatred it gave. Blind love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that killest the choicest friends for the deadliest foes! a
strange way really to hate, out of suspicion that we may be hated;
to be miserable, for fear of being miserable: But see the hand
of God, to whom they appealed; he that would needs fight, falls;
and be that would not, conquers, though the oddes of Mr. <hi>Comp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi>
side was five to one.</p>
            <p>Duels (those exercises that become neither men, for men should
reason and beasts fight; nor Christian, whose honor it is to suffer
injuries, but neither to give, nor retaliate any) generally favor
the most unwilling, as honor the thing they fight for, being a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

            <head>THE
Life and Death
Of the Right Honorable
ROBERT DORMER,
Earl of Caernarvon.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>RObert Dormer</hi> (Grand-Child to <hi>Robert Dormer</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Baronet by King <hi>Iames, Iune</hi> 10. 1615. and Baron
<hi>Dormer</hi> of <hi>Wing</hi> in <hi>Buckingham-shire,</hi> the thirtieth of the
same Month in the same year) was by King <hi>Charles</hi> in the
fourth year of his Reign made Viscount <hi>Ascot,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narvon,</hi>
a Person of whom King <hi>Charles</hi> the First might say, as <hi>Lewis</hi>
the 13<hi>th.</hi> said of his Favorite <hi>Luynes,</hi> that considering the debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nairness
of his temper when disposed to be merry, he was a very
fit man to be trusted with the Kings Majesties Game, as he was,
being by a Grant to him and his Heirs <hi>Chief Avenor:</hi> and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the vastness of his parts when disposed to be serious, he
was very capable of the most concerning trust, which he had by
Pattent, as Lord Lieutenant. His nature was not so much wild,
as great: and his spirit rather extraordinary than extravagant;
to be admired rather than blamed, as what age and experience
fixed every day more and more into a comprehensive wisdom, a
deep understanding, a strong resolution, and a noble activity.
His Recreations were rather expensive than bruitish, not <hi>unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
his person, as Drunkenness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he hated perfectly, he
being prone of those that gave occasion to the scandalous, <hi>and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi>
comparitive Proverb, <hi>As drunk as a Lord, as drunk as a Beggar;</hi>
but if moderately used, becoming his Dignity as Gaming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which he affected inordinately, though he left this caution to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity:
<hi>That he that makes playing his business, makes his business a
play;</hi> and that Gaming swallow Estates, as the Gulf did <hi>Curtius</hi>
and his Horse. <hi rend="margQuotes">A man knoweth where he <hi>begins</hi> that pleasure,
but is utterly ignorant where he shall <hi>end;</hi>
               </hi> besides, that there is
no pleasure worthy an excellent spirit in high Gaming, which can
have no satisfaction in it, besides either sordid Coveting of what is
anothers, or a foolish Prodigality of what is their <hi>own;</hi> 
               <hi rend="margQuotes">making
that breach in their own inheritance sometimes in one week,
which they and their Heirs cannot repair in many years.</hi>
The temperature of his minde as to moral habits, was rather
disposed to good than evil; he was a Courtier and a young
Man, a Profession, and an Age prone to such desires, as
when they tend to the shedding of no Mans bloud, to
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59370:195"/>
the ruin of no family, humanity sometimes connives at, though
she never approves of; so that we may say of this Great man, as
one doth of a greater, <hi>That those things we wish in him, are fewer
than the things we praise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being a Servant, not only to his Majesties <hi>Prosperity,</hi> but to his
<hi>Person;</hi> waiting on him, not out of Interest, but out of Love and
Conscience; no sooner appeared the Conspiracy in <hi>Buckingham-shire,</hi>
but he discountenanced it upon all occasions, with his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
and when it brake out in the North, he Marched to oppose
it with two thousand men, whom (when he could in Parliament,
neither save the Life of his Majesties most faithful Servant, not
preserve the Honor of his Majesties Person, being resolved rather
to perish with the known Laws of the Land, than to countenance
them that designed the overthrow of them) he led, to wait on his
Majesty to <hi>York,</hi> where having, with the rest of the Nobility, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
the integrity of his Majesties proceedings, and vowed his
defence, under his Hand and Seal, he Rendezvouzed, Marching to
settle the <hi>Commission of Array,</hi> in <hi>Oxford-shire</hi> and <hi>Buckingham-shire,</hi>
with so much activity, that we finde him with the Earls of <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
New-castle,</hi> and <hi>Rivers,</hi> excepted by the Party at <hi>Westwinster,</hi>
out of the first Indemnity,<note n="a" place="margin">In the fourth Article of <hi>Essex</hi> his commission.</note> 1642. they offered for their actions
in behalf of his Majesty, as the Earl of <hi>Bristol,</hi> the Lords Viscount
<hi>Newarke</hi> and <hi>Faulkland,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Hyde,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Nicholas,</hi> Master
<hi>Endymion Porter,</hi> were for their Counsels and Writing. And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disciplined his Regiment, we finde him the Reserve generally
to the Kings Horse in all Engagements, as first to Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> in
<hi>Edge-hill,</hi> where his error was too much heat, in pursuing an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
against the Enemies Horse, in the mean time deserting and
leaving naked his own Foot; and afterwards to the Lord <hi>Willmot</hi>
at <hi>Roundway-down,</hi> where by Charging near, and Drawing up his
men to advantage, not above six in a File, that they might all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
he turned the fortune of the day, as he had done at <hi>Newbury,</hi>
(receiving Sir <hi>Philip Stapleton</hi> with this Regiment of Horse, and
<hi>Essex</hi> his Life-guard with a brisk Charge, and pursuing them to
their Foot) had not a private hand put an end to his life and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
when breathing out his last, he asked, <hi>Whether the King was in
safety?</hi> Dying with the same care of his Majesty, that he lived.</p>
            <p>So he lost his life, fighting for him who gave him his honor, at
the first<note n="b" place="margin">Septemb. 20. 1643.</note> battel of <hi>Newbury.</hi> Being sore wounded, he was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by a Lord, to know of him, what suit he would have to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
in his behalf? the said Lord promising to discharge his trust,
in presenting his request, and assuring him, that his Majesty would
be willing to gratifie him to the utmost of his power. To whom
the Earl replied, <hi>I will not dye with a Suit in my mouth to any King,
save to the King of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Anne</hi> Daughter to <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> and <hi>Mountgome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
he had <hi>Charles</hi> now Earl of <hi>Caernarvon.</hi> From his noble extract
he received not more honor than he gave; it for the blood that was
conveighed to him, through so many illustrious veins, he derived
to his Children, more maturated for renown; and by a constant
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:59370:195"/>
practice of goodness, more habituated to virtue. His youth was
prepared for action by study, without which even the most emi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nent
parts of Noblemen seem rough and unpleasant, in dispight
of the splendor of their fortune: But his riper years endured
not those retirements, and therefore brake out into manlike exer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cises
at home, and travail abroad. None more Noble, yet none
more modest; none more Valiant, yet none more patient.</p>
            <p>A Physician at his Father-in-laws Table gave him a Lye, which
put the Company to admire, on the one hand the mans impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and on the other my Lords mildness; until he said, <hi>I'll take
the Lye from him, but I'll never take Physick of him: He may speak
what doth not become him, I'll not do what is unworthy of me.</hi> A vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
this! not usual in Noblemen, to whom the limits of equity
seem a restraint, and therefore are more restless in injuries.</p>
            <p>In the midst of horror and tumults, his soul was sere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and
calm. As humble he was as patient. Honor and Nobility, to which
nothing can be added, hath no better way to increase, than when
secured of its own greatness, it humbleth it self, and at once oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
love, and avoideth envy. His carriage was a condescending
as Heroick, and his speech as weighty as free; he was too great to
envy any mans parts and virtues, and too good to encourage them;
many times would he stoop with his own spirit, to raise other mens.
He neglected the minutes and little circumstances of compliance
with vulgar humors, aiming at what was more solid and more
weighty: Moderate men are applauded, but the Heroick are never
understood.</p>
            <p>Constant he was in all that was good: This was his Heroick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
when sollicited by his Wives Father, to desist from his en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gagement
with the King, <hi>Leave me to my Honor and Allegiance.</hi> No
security to him worth a breach of trust, no interest worth being
unworthy. His conduct was as eminent in war, as his carriage in
peace; many did he oblige by the generosity of his minde, more
did he awe with the hardiness of his body; which was no more
softned to sloath, the dalliances of a Court, than the other was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
to carelessness by the greatness of his fortunes. His pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
was equal to his valor, and could entertain dangers as well
as despise them; for he not only undeceived his enemies surmises,
but exceeded his own friends opinion in the conduct of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers;
of whom he had two cares, the one to his discipline, the
other to preserve them; therefore they were as compleatly armed
without, as they were well appointed within; that surviving
their first dangers, they might attain that experience and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is in vain expected from young and raw Souldiers.</p>
            <p>To this conduct of a General, he added the industry of a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
doing much by his performances, more by his example; that
went as an active soul to enliven each part, and the whole of his
brave Squadron. But there is no doubt, but personal and private
sins may oft times overballance the justice of publick engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Nor doth God account every Gallant a fit instrument, to
assert in the way of war a righteous Cause; the event can never
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59370:196"/>
state the justice of any Cause, nor the peace of men, consciences,
nor the eternal fate of their souls.</p>
            <p>They were no doubt Martyrs, who neglected their lives, and all
that was dear to them in this world, having no advantageous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
by any innovation, but were religiously sensible of those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies
to God, the Church, their Country, which lay upon their souls,
both for obedience and just assistance.</p>
            <p>God could, and I doubt not but he did, through his mercy
crown many of them with eternal life, whose lives were lost in so
good a Cause; the destruction of their bodies being sanctified a
means to save their souls.</p>
            <p>Such who object that he was extreamly wild in his youth, put
me in minde of the return which one made to an ill natured man
in a Company, who with much bitterness had aggravated the <hi>loose
youth</hi> of an aged and godly Divine; <hi>You have proved</hi> (said he) <hi>what
all knew before,</hi> with much pains, <hi>that</hi> Paul <hi>was a great Persecutar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was Converted:</hi> Besides that, as many then spake more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely
than they lived, he lived more strictly than he spake; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that liberty in his discourse, he did not in his actions.</p>

<hi>Susan Newport</hi> his Wife, was born at <hi>Mountgomery-Castle,</hi>
and brought to Court by the Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brooke,</hi>
where he was Knighted by King <hi>Iames,</hi> who
sent him over Embassador into <hi>France.</hi> Afterwards
King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, Created him Baron of <hi>Castle-Island</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:59370:196"/>
He was a most excellent Artist and rare Linguist, studied both
in Books and Men, and himself the Author of two Works most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
<hi>viz. A. Treatise of Truth,</hi> written in <hi>French,</hi> so highly
prized beyond the Seas, and (they say) it is extant at this day with
great honor in the Popes Vatican. And an History of King <hi>Henry</hi>
the Eighth, wherein his Collections are full and authentick, his
Observation judicious, his Connexion strong and coherent, and the
whole exact. He Married the Daughter and sole Heir of Sir
<hi>William Herbert</hi> of St. <hi>Iulians</hi> in <hi>Monmouth-shire,</hi> with whom he had
a large inheritance in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and died in <hi>August, Anno
Domini,</hi> 1648. having designed a fair Monument of his own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to be set up for him in the Church of <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> according
to the Model following;
<q>Vpon the ground a Hath-pace of fourteen Foot square, on the
middest of which is placed a Dorick Column, with its right
of Pedestal Basis, and Capitols fifteen Foot in height, on the
Capitol of the Column is mounted a Vrn with a heart flamboul,
supported by two Angels. The foot of this Column is attended
with four Angels, placed on Pedestals, at each corner of the
said Hath-pace; two having Torches reverst, Extinguishing
the Motto of Mortality; the other two holding up Palms, the
Emblems of Victory.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When this Noble Person was in <hi>France,</hi> he had private Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
from <hi>England,</hi> to mediate a Peace for them of the Religion;
and in case of refusal, to use certain menaces. Accordingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
referred to <hi>Luynes</hi> the Constable and Favourite of <hi>France,</hi> he
delivereth him the Message, reserving his threatnings, till he saw
how the matter was relished. <hi>Luynes</hi> had hid behind the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a Gentleman of the Religion, who being an ear-witness of
what passed, might relate to his friends, what little expectations
they ought to entertain from the King of <hi>Englands</hi> intercession.</p>
            <p>Luynes <hi>was very haughty, and would needs know what our King
had to do with their affairs. Sir</hi> Edward <hi>replyed;</hi> It is not to you,
to whom the King my Master oweth an account of his actions; and for
me it is enough that I obey him. In the mean time, I must maintain, That
my Master hath more reason to do, what he doth, than you to ask, why
he doth it? Nevertheless, if you desire me in a gentle fashion, I shall
acquaint you further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereupon</hi> Luynes <hi>bowing a little, said,</hi> very well. <hi>The Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
answered,</hi> That it was not on this occasion only, that the King of
<hi>Great Britain</hi> had desired the Peace and Prosperity of <hi>France,</hi> but upon
all other occasions, when ever any War was raised in that Country, <hi>and
this he said was his first reason. The second was,</hi> That when a Peace
was setled there, his Majesty of <hi>France,</hi> might be better disposed to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the <hi>Palatine</hi> in the affairs of <hi>Germany.</hi> Luynes <hi>said,</hi> We will have
none of your advices. <hi>The Ambassador replyed,</hi> That he took that
for an answer, and was sorry only that the affection, and the good will of
the King his Master was not sufficiently understood; and that since it
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59370:197"/>
was rejected in that manner, he could do no less than say, That the King
his Master knew well enough what he had to do. Luynes <hi>answered,</hi>
We are not afraid of you. <hi>The Ambassador smiling a little, replyed,</hi>
If you had said you had not loved us, I should have believed you, and
made another answer: In the mean time, all that I will tell you more is,
That we know very well what we have to do. Luynes <hi>hereupon ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from his Chair, with a fashion and countenance a little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed,
said,</hi> By God, if you were not <hi>Mounsieur</hi> the Ambassador,
I know very well how I would use you. <hi>Sir</hi> Edward Herbert <hi>rising also
from his Chair, said,</hi> That as he was his Majesty of <hi>Great Brittains</hi>
Ambassador, so he was also a Gentleman, and that his Sword whereon he
laid his hands, should do him reason if he had taken any offence. <hi>After
which</hi> Luynes <hi>replying nothing, the Ambassador went on his way
toward the door, and</hi> Luynes <hi>seeming to accompany him, he told
him there was no occasion to use such Ceremony after such Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and departed, expecting to hear further from him: But
no message being brought him from</hi> Luynes, <hi>he had in pursuance
of his Instructions, a more civil Audience of the King at</hi> Coignac,
<hi>where the Marshal of St.</hi> Geran <hi>told him he had offended the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,
and he was not in a place of Security here: Whereunto he
answered, That he held himself to be in a place of security where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he had his Sword by him.</hi>

<hi>Edward</hi> kept himself within the bounds of his Instructions and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,

take it into consideration: But <hi>Luynes</hi> a little after dyed, &amp; Sir <hi>Edw.</hi>

that if it had not been for fear and jealousies, the bane of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

and as great a Statesman, as he is confessed a Scholar.</p>

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Dr. JOHN WILLIAMS,
Lord Archbishop of York.</head>
            <p>DOctor <hi>Iohn Williams,</hi> born at <hi>Aber Conway</hi> in <hi>Caernarvon-shire,</hi>
bred Fellow of St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
and Proctor of that University, hath this Character
<hi rend="margQuotes">That a strong Constitution made his parts, a strict E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation
improved them; unwearied was his Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
unexpressible his capacity. He never saw the Book of
worth he read not, he never forgot what he read; he never lost
the use of what he remembred: Every thing he heard or saw
was his own; and what was his own, he knew how to use to
the utmost. His Extraction being Gentile, his large and
Noble, his Presence and Carriage comely and stately, his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Copious, his Judgment stayed, his Apprehension clear and
searching, his Expression lively and Effectual, his Elocution
flowing and Majestick, his Proctorship, 1612. discovered him a
Person above his Place; and his Lectures to his Pupils, above his
Preferment. Bishop <hi>Vaughan</hi> first admitted him to his Family,
and then to his bosom; there his strong Sermons, his exact Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
(under my Lord,) his plentiful observation, his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
acquaintance, made him my Lord Chancellor <hi>Egertons</hi>
Friend, rather than his Servant; his Familiar, rather than his
Chaplain. Never was there a more communicative Master to
instruct, than my Lord <hi>Elsemere;</hi> never a more capable Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
to learn than Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> who had instilled to him all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
State Maxims while his old Master lived, and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
unto him four excellent Books when his Master was
dead. These four Books he presented to King <hi>Iames</hi> the very
same time that he offered himself to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham;</hi>
The excellent Prince observed him as much for the first gift, as
the Noble Duke (of <hi>Buckingham</hi>) did for the second: The King
and Duke made him their own, who they saw had made that
excellent Book his. Willing was King <hi>Iames</hi> to advance Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and glad to meet with men capable of advancements.</hi>
His two Sermons at Court made him Dean of <hi>Westminster;</hi> his
exact state of the Earl of <hi>Somersets</hi> Case made him capable of, and
the Kings inclination to trust his Conscience in a Divines hand,
setled him in a Lord Keepers place actually, only for three years
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59370:198"/>
to please the people, (who were offended with his years, now but
thirty four, and his Calling a Divine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

serve his Majesty. The Lawyers despised him<note n="a" place="margin">Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cook</hi> hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where a saying that Divines meddle with Law, but they commit great Errors.</note> at first, but
the Judges admired him at last: and one of them said, That ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               </gap> the Law,
Reason, and other Circumstances more punctually, recollected
the various Debates more faithfully, summed it up more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiously,
and concluded more judiciously and discreetly:
For many of them might have read more than he, but none digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what they had read more solidly; none disposed of their read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more methodically, none therefore commanded it more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.
He demurred several Orders, as that of my Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
pardon, the Earl Marshals Pattent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to let his Majesty see
his Judgment; yet passed them, to let him see his Obedience:
He would question the Dukes Order sometimes discreetly, to let
him know he understood himself; yet he would yield handsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to let him see he understood <hi>him:</hi> and indeed he had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
faculty of making every one of his actions carry prudence
in the performance. Necessary it was, for one of his years and
place, to keep his distance, to <hi>avoid contempt;</hi> yet fatal was to him
to do so, and <hi>incur envy.</hi> Well understood he the interest of all
his places, and resolutely he maintained them. <hi>What,</hi> saith he,
<hi>shall the Liberties of</hi> Westminster <hi>he infringed, when the chief Favorite
is Steward, and the Lord Keeper D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>an, and I the Contemptible man that
must be trampled on?</hi> When he was in trouble, what passion, what
insinuation, what condescension hath he at command? when Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to, how quickly he looked through men and business?
how exactly would he judge, and how resolutely conclude, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an immediate intimation from his Majesty or the Duke? Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
eyes were upon him, and as many eyes were kept by him upon
others; being very watchful on all occasions to accommodate all
emergencies, and meet with all humors, always keeping men in
dependance on the Duke, according to this intimation of his—
<hi>Cabal</hi> 287. <hi>Let him hold it, but by your Lordships favor, not his own
power.</hi> A good way, had he been constant to it, the neglect
whereof undid him; for designing the promotion of Dr. <hi>Price</hi> to
the Bishoprick of <hi>Armagh,</hi> he moved it to the Duke, who told
him it was disposed of to Dr. <hi>Vsher.</hi> Whereupon he went his own
way to advance that man, and overthrew himself: for then his
Lord let him feel what he had threatned my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> when he
advanced him; <hi>That if he did not owe his Preferment always to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
he should owe his fall to his frown.</hi> The peremptoriness of his
judgment rendred him <hi>odious:</hi> his compliance with <hi>Bristol, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;</hi>
and his Sermon at King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Funeral (his tryal, rather
than his Preferment) <hi>obnoxious.</hi> His spirit was great to <hi>act,</hi> and
too great to <hi>suffer.</hi> It was prudence to execute his Decrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all opposition while in power; it was not so, to bear up his
miscarriages against all Authority, while in <hi>disgrace.</hi> A sanguine
Complexion, with its Resolutions, do well in pursuit of success:
Flegm and its patience do better in a Retreat from micarriages.

This he wanted, when (it may be thinking <hi>fear</hi> was the passion of

had those private grounds and reasons, that if the Bishop could
have spoken with the King but half an hour, he said, would have
satisfied him, the King of Kings only knoweth, to whom he hath
given I hope a better account than any Historian of his time hath
given for him.</p>
            <p>But I understand better his private inclinations, than his pub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lick
actions; the motions of his nature, than those of his power;
the Conduct of the one being not more reserved and suspicious,
than the effects of the other <hi>manifest</hi> and <hi>noble:</hi> for not to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Libraries erected and furnished at St. <hi>Iohns</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi>

and telleth him, he doubted the good man was low, wishing
him to repair to him with some Money, and his respects, with as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
that he would wait upon him himself at his first leisure.
The excellent Doctor rejoyceth, <hi>that he could carry him no less than
twenty pounds;</hi> The Noble Bishop replyed, <hi>he named not the summe,</hi>
to sound his Chaplains minde; adding, that twenty pounds was
neither fit for him to give, nor for the Reverend Forreigner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
<hi>Carry,</hi> said he, <hi>an hundred pounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is Libelled by common fame for unchaste, though those that
understood the privacies and casualties of his Infancy, report him
but one degree removed from a <hi>Misogonist;</hi> Though to palliate his
infirmities, he was most compleat in Courtly addresses. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versableness
of this Bishop with Women consisted chiefly (if not
only) in his Treatments of great Ladies and Persons of honor,
wherein he did personate the compleatness of Courtesie to that
Sex; otherwise a Woman was seldom seen in his house, which
therefore had alwayes more Magnificence than Neatness,
sometimes defective in the Punctilio's and Niceties of Dainti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
lying lower than Masculine Cognizance, and as level
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59370:199"/>
for a Womans eye to espy, as easie for her hand to amend.</p>
            <p>He suffereth for conniving at Puritans, out of hatred to Bishop
<hi>Loud;</hi> and for favoring Papists out of love to them; yet what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he offered King <hi>Iames</hi> (when the Match went on in <hi>Spain</hi>) as a
Counsellor, or whatever he did himself as a Statesman; such
kindness he had for our Liturgy, that he translated and Printed it
at his own Cost into <hi>Spanish,</hi> and used it in the <hi>Visitation</hi> of <hi>Melvin,</hi>
when sick to his own peril, in the <hi>Tower;</hi> and such resolution for
Episcopacy, that his late Majesty of blessed Memory said once to
him; <hi>My Lord, I commend you that you are no whit daunted with all
Disasters, but are zealous in defending your Order.</hi> Please it your
Majesty, replyed the Archbishop, <hi>I am a true Welshman, and they
are observed never to run away till their Generall first forsakes them, no
fear of any flinching, while your Majesty doth countenance our Cause.</hi>

Character to his honor in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Wariness hath these Arguments.</p>
            <p>1. That he would not send the Seal to the King, but under
Lock and Key.</p>
            <p>2. That being to depute one to attend his place at the Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, he would not name his Adversary, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Laud,</hi> to gratifie him; nor yet any other, to displease the King;
but took a middle way, and presented his Majesty a List of the
Prebendaries, to avoid any exception, referring the Election to his
Majesty himself.</p>
            <p>3. That he proposed a partial<note n="c" place="margin">At the Meeting in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem-chamber,</hi> March 1641. with 20. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists and Non-conformists, appointed upon his motion to consider of the reformation of discipline and government, worship and doctrine, with the innova<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lately crept into all of them.</note> Reformation of our Church
to the Parliament, to prevent an utter extirpation by it.</p>
            <p>4. That he exposed others to the censure of the Parliament,
1625. to save himself.</p>
            <p>5. That he answered to several Examinations upon the strength
of his memory, without any the least advantage taken by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist.</p>
            <p>This Character of his I think very exact; that his Head was a
well-fitted treasury, and his Tongue the fair key to unlock it; that
he had as great a memory, as could be reconciled with so good a
judgment; that so quick his parts, that others study went not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his nature; and their designed and fore-laid performances,
went not beyond his sudden and ready accommodations. Only
he was very open, and too free in discourse, disdaining to lye at a
close guard, as confident of the length and strength of his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.</p>
            <p>The first eminent Performance that raised him, was the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
he made 1612. when Proctor to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadors,
brought thither by my Lord Chancellor <hi>Elsmere,</hi> where with the
gracefulness of his presence, the great ingenuity of his discourses,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59370:199"/>
the comeliness of his Addresses, the short, courtly, pleasant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of the Exercises, whereof he was Moderator; and especially
that skill in the <hi>Spanish</hi> tongue, wherewith he had prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he did himself, the University, and the Nation so much
right, that the Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> and of the University,
in the presence, and with the approbation of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
took his leave of him, with this Character, <hi>That he had behaved
himself so well in this Treat to the Ambassadors, that he was fit to serve a
King, and that he would see him as much wellcomed at Court, as they were
in the Vniversity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He knew the value of an opportunity, whereof he would say,
that every man had it sooner or later, and the neglect or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, was the marring or making of every man in the world,
and therefore he hazarded the expence of his present fortune, to
furnish himself to a capacity for a new one. Having occasion to
appear in publick but seldom, when he came up, he was very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in the choice, pertinenoy, and seasonableness of his subject, and
in the exactness of his composure, setting out at once the variety
of his learning, the strength of his parts, and the<note n="a" place="margin">Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thence, no care for his Books and Estate; which when plundred,

of the year 1660. when all things tended visibly to the great
Restauration, and the good Dr. was invited to <hi>London,</hi> to assist in
the great work of the composure of breaches in the Church;
against which undertaking, and the ensuing publick employments
he was to expect: He 1 Examined his inclinations, temptations,
and defects, with the assistance of his friends. 2. He contrived
such publick good works, as he might lay himself out in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess

in behalf of the Nation, now under its great Crisis, and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
method of Cure. But on the fourth of <hi>April,</hi> a sharp Fit of
the Stone seized him, which put him, who at other times would
say, <hi>I am not dying yet,</hi> into such apprehensions of his danger, that
he told the mournful Spectators of his agonies, <hi>That he should leave
them in Gods hands; who would so provide, that they should not finde
his removal any loss;</hi> adding, <hi>That they should turn their prayers for
his recovery into intercessions for his happy change. I pray</hi> (said he very
passionately) <hi>let some of your fervor be employed that way:</hi> Being
pressed to make it his own request to God, that he might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to serve the Church, he allowed this, a part of his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz. That if his life might be useful to any one soul, he besought Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God to continue him, and by his grace to ennable him to employ
that life, he so vouchsafed, industriously and successfully.</hi> Adding for
the Church, that sincere performance of Christian duties, so much
decayed, to the equal supplanting and scandal of that holy Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling;
that those who professed that Faith might live according to
the rules of it, and to the form of Godliness superadd the power
of it; restraining the <hi>ex tempore</hi> irregularities of his friends eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
with that grave saying, <hi>Let us call on God in the voice of

he said chearfully, <hi>It was a mercy, and that to bleed to death, was
one of the most desireable passages out of this world:</hi>) and found no

the Lethargy that, and the Flux of Bloud the Lethargy; which
variety of tortures, exercised not only his patience, but his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness

remedy by applications or revulsives, until the torrent ceased, the
fountain being exhausted, and the good Doctor became so weak,
so cold, and so dispirited, that he had strength enough only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe

life; a few minutes before his death, breathing out those words,
which best became his Christian life, <hi>Lord make haste.</hi> The same
day, that commenced the Nations happiness, the Convention of a
Free-Parliament, concluded his life, just when it was like to be
most comfortable to himself, and serviceable to the Church: As if
this great Champion of Religion, and pattern of all virtue, were
reserved for exigence and hazzard, for persecution and suffering;

no more private respects, than those of nature and necessity: the
oppressed, the sick, his Enemies taking up a great part of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy

a lover of this vertue, that it was his grand design to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
and improve it among all he judged capable of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
to mutual advantage; adding, that three persons he knew,
whom their studies and troubles had leagued together, <hi>were the
happiest men in the Nation; and that he himself had no such way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
any thing as by reflexion from the person whom he loved, that
his friends neglect of themselves was an unkindness to him;</hi> That he
had a thousand times rather that his <hi>friend</hi> should have that which
was conducible to health, than to have it himself: assuming, that
if this were believed, it were impossible any one should attempt
to express kindness by robbing him of his greatest pleasure, to see
others do well. There are two eminent fruits of Friendship.
1. The ease of the Heart. 2. The clearing of the minde. Two
ways doth this excellent vertue conduce to the last.</p>
               <p>1. By giving us opportunity with security to open and reflect
upon our own thoughts before our Confident.</p>
               <p>2. By his faithful admonitin and advice which the Doctor
would have extended by others and him self, even<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t indecencies
and suspitions, saying usually, <hi>that it was a poor design of friendship to
keep the person he admitted to his breast from being scandalous, as if
the Physician should endeavor only to secure his Patient from the Plague.</hi>
Advertisements to which his friends were obliged, though of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
features, were the greatest kindness and Complements, such
as that sent him in his Agonies, more tolerable to him than that
message <hi>(that now the dayes were come when his deserts should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59370:206"/>
and himself employed in the Government as well as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Church.</hi> The most insufferable injuries that could be
done him, who was so perfect an enemy to flattery, that when he
did but suspect once that a commendation of one passage in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of his, was brought in as an allay to some fore-going plain
dealing, <hi>He protested that nothing in the world could more avert his
love and deeply disoblige, than such unfaithfulness.</hi> Neither was his
friendship more punctual than constant, intervenient failures not
superseding his affection, but improving it to a <hi>tenderness</hi> for the
person, increased by his detestation of his Vice; excepting always
those two things, <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Falseness,</hi> which checked his kindness,
because, as he said, they cut off the end of it, his capacity of doing
good otherwise, never despairing of the <hi>mollia tempora,</hi> of plain
and honest tempers, free from those artifices and close pretensions
which he perfectly hated, and as dextrously discovered, making it
evident he did so when <hi>seasonable;</hi> a circumstance he was very
tender of, whose rule and example it was never <hi>to reprove in anger,
or out of time:</hi> it being his design to gain as much upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
affections he dealt with, by the kindness of his exhortations,
as upon their judgments by the weight and evidence of them;
whence the little phrase, <hi>don't be simple,</hi> 
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">from him had more
power to charm a passion, than long harangues from others,
whose just discourses of Piety and Vertue,</hi> were <hi>derided</hi> when his
very intimations were <hi>venerated: venerated</hi> I should not have said,
for he would say, <hi>he delighted to be beloved, not reverenced:</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the last being not in his judgment consistent with the
freedom of the first. In a word, two qualifications he required in
Friendship. 1. Plain dealing apart from all jealousies and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cealments,
the banes of correspondence. <hi>It were barbarous to con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demn
a Malefactor,</hi> (these are his own Sentiments) <hi>more a friend,
without being heard.</hi> 2. Generosity above all mercenary returns.
<hi>Love</hi> (he said) <hi>was built upon the union and similitude of minds, and
not the bribery of gifts and benefits;</hi> he admitting (as he professed)
<hi>retributions of good turns, not so much on any score, as that his friend
might have the pleasure of being kinde:</hi> and scrupling the relief of a
person of Quality (whom he had supplyed during the late times
of tryal) upon the <hi>grand Restauration,</hi> for fear it might look rather
like a design than a Charity, untill being convinced it would <hi>be</hi> a
kindness, he was less concerned what it might be <hi>called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Friendship was as wide as Vertue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> His Charity.</note> and his Charity as spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as Necessity, for which be exactly allowed the tenth of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
as due, besides the Free-will offering at his weekly Fasts<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and upon all occasions that offered themselves, being so much
more intent upon the poors condition than his own, that he would
make his low estate an argument for their relief; yea, as industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as he was to conceal his Charity, we finde an 100<hi>l.</hi> bestowed
on one distressed person of Quality, 60<hi>l.</hi> on another, 20<hi>l.</hi> on a
third, and all out of a Stock that he had, no visible means but this
parting with it, and a blessing upon it to supply. Yet still did he
look by his Agents for new Pensioners, especially <hi>Sequestred Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:59370:207"/>
their Widows and Orphans, young Students, and the Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for whom he <hi>procured</hi> and <hi>sent</hi> considerable sums year by year.
His Charity had these excellent qualifications. 1. It was as far as
he and his intelligencers could observe <hi>seasonably.</hi> 2. It was as suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the modesty of his Pensioners, as seasonable to their necessity.
3. It was chearful, an instance of his usual observation, <hi>That it
was one of the greatest sensualities in the world to give, and that it
was the exceeding indulgence of God, that had annexed future rewards,
to that which was so amply its own recompence.</hi> 4. It was of the best
he had, being much concerned, that a Servant in the Family, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the Gout, had, as he directed, any worse than his own
Plaister to ease him, although the store of that was almost spent.
And, 5. It was with that familiar and hearty kindness, as became
him, who would say, <hi>It was a most unreasonable, and unchristian thing,
to despise any for being poor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither was it his care only to relieve poverty,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> His alms of Lending.</note> but to prevent
it; by lending <hi>gratis</hi> (though he allowed Usury) to honest and
industrious men, several sums of money, and contriving how they
might dispose of them to their advantage, dismissing them with
infinite affability and kindness, and a prayer for Gods blessing.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding these profusions of charity,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> His ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity.</note> he had where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to be gentile and liberal, rewarding at an highly ingenious
rate most presents above the value, with that satisfaction, that he
would say, <hi>Alas! poor soul, Ile warrant you he is glad of this little matter;</hi>
and make that opportunity of <hi>giving</hi> a part of the <hi>senders</hi> courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
first; and freely contributing to most publick works; as fifty
pounds towards the great Bible, three hundred pounds upon the
repair of his Parsonage-house, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Allowing himself not above
five pounds a year, upon no other principle, but thereby to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral

discomforture of seeing he had made an unseasonable offer, so that
it remains still a wonder, that in spight of himself, he was at his

he said, <hi>The half of his estate being scattered, was more than the

prudence, to the censure of most of his friends, even the meanest,
(saying, <hi>There was no man that was honest to him, by whom he
could not profit;</hi> withal, <hi>that he was to expect Readers of several sorts,
and if one illiterate man was stumbled, 'twas likely others of his form
would be so too, whose interest when he writ to all, was not to be passed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Besides, those less discerning Observators, if they could do nothing else</hi>
(he said) <hi>could serve to draw Teeth,</hi> i. e. <hi>admonish,</hi> if ought was <hi>too
sharply writ.</hi>) Engaging them all to lay aside all kindness, but that
greatest of being faithful; and saying of an eminent person, that
had retutned him a Complement instead of a Censure, <hi>That he had
reaped this benefit by the disappointment, to have learned never to send

                  </gap> admitted to the subsequent Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Books, <hi>he would profess himself astonished at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
into the world, especially,</hi> as he withal was pleased to add,
<hi>since others failed therein, whose performances were infinitely beyond any
thing which he was able to do.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note n="2" place="margin">In reference to others.</note> The less his esteem was of what he did himself, the more his

meanest person, to whom he would come without any delay (which
he allowed not in himself, and chid in others, even in his excellent
Lady, when diverted by the attractives of his discourses, she neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the many Clients, either of her charity in Almes or Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery)
in the midst of his beloved studies. This being the rule his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging

such a chearfulness, that they may be glad to have met with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The instances of his condescension are such as these, 1. One
<hi>Houseman</hi> a <hi>Weaver,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Instances of his Condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> a pious but sickly man, he honored with his

in case he removed (saying once to the Lady, <hi>Will you not think it
strange, I should be more affected for parting from</hi> Houseman, <hi>than
from you?</hi>) and he bequeathed him ten pounds at his death. 2. One
<hi>Sexion</hi> of <hi>Penschurst,</hi> to whom he sent his Books, keeping constant
correspondence with him, though his Returns were scarce legible,
pensioning his Boy at School, and remembring him in his Will.</p>
               <p>3. One who happening on the Doctors Writings, was so affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them, as to leave his Family and Employment, and wait
upon the Doctor himself for directions in his Study, which he had
with all other assistance, insomuch, as that he is become now a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
useful person in the Church.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth shall be a hopeful young man at <hi>Oxford,</hi> whose
love to Magick, engaged him in bad Company, until the Dr. took
him to his own reading some books with him, particularly <hi>Homer,</hi>
one of whose <hi>Iliads,</hi> was their Night entertainment, and two on
Holy-days; whereon the Doctor would say, with reflection on the
then debauches, <hi>Come it is Holy-day, let us be jovial, and take the
other</hi> Iliad.</p>
               <p>5. A vicious man on his death-bed, desired to speak with the
Doctor, which he heard not till the party was departing, to his
great trouble; <hi>At the bruitishness of those</hi> (they are his own words)
<hi>that had so little sense of a soul in that sad state.</hi> Whence he obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that by this example, <hi>others,</hi> and in particular the companions
of that unhappy persons vice, might learn how improper a season
the time of sickness, and how unfit a place a death-bed is for that
one great important work of Penitance, <hi>Which was intended by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, the one commensurate work of his whole life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. One in the Voisinage mortally sick of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> then fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to most of the <hi>Doctors</hi> complexion, desired the Dr. to come to
him; he makes no more ado, when satisfied that the party was so
sensible as to be capable of his instructions, assuring those that
were fearful of him, <hi>That he should be as much in Gods hands, in the
sick mans Chamber, as in his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. He kept a despairing person several days in his Chamber,
attending and answering, with unwearied patience, all those little
scruples and arguments, that unhappy temper too ready suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
until the poor soul was settled by his happy method, <hi>Wherein
duty still preceded promise, and strict endeavor only founded comfort.</hi>
And to add no more, though to do good to all was his unlimited
design, yet to nourish and advance the early vertue of young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
was his more chosen study; to whom he insinuated the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
pleasure, and advantage of a pious life on the one hand, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the danger and mischief of brutal sensuality on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

Catechizing of the same Children in his Chamber on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
in the afternoon, whereby he ensnared the Servants to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive
those Lessons obliquely, which their bashfulness would not

have a kindness for Religion; but own the seducing men to God, with
as much confidence at least, as others use, when they are Factors for the
Devil; and instead of lying on the guard, and the Defensive part, he
gave in charge to chuse the other of Assailant:</hi> Adding, <hi>That this was
their security, it being like the not expecting of a threatned war at home,
but carrying it abroad in the enemies Country; and nothing in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stian

trivial things</hi> (he pronounced) <hi>as treason to our selves, as well as unto

opposition, we shall be safe; for no attempts can hurt us, till we treat
with the Assailants: temptations of all sorts having that good quality

overtures of evil. 2. <hi>Hoc age,</hi> be intent and serious in good;<note place="margin">His Advises.</note> to
which he adjoyned a third, viz. <hi>Be furnished with a friend.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
at a solemn parture, he discoursed to one of his disciples,
thus: <hi>I have heard say of a man, who upon his death-bed, being to take
his farewell of his Son, and considering what course of life to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
that he might secure his Innocence; at last enjoyned him to spend
his time in making Verses, and in dressing a Garden; the Old Man
thinking no temptation could creep into either of these employments.</hi>
                  <pb n="398" facs="tcp:59370:209"/>
But I in stead of these expedients, will recommend the other, <hi>the
doing all the good you can to every person, and the having of a Friend,
whereby your life shall not only be rendred innocent, but extreamly
happy.</hi>
               </p>

than patient under his own ills; whether <hi>first</hi> of contempt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that they were not so in their eager dissent against his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
in so much that in ten years converse, neither his sanguine
temper, nor his great temptations were observed to transport his
passion to any <hi>indecency:</hi>) Or secondly of pain, which (though he
would say <hi>he was of all things most a Coward to</hi>) yet he endured with
eminent constancy and perfect resignation; <hi>his first consideration
being, what failing had provoked the present chastisement, and his prayer
that God would convince him of it; nor only so, but tear and rend away
though by the greatest violence and sharpest discipline, whatever was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
in his eye, and grant not only patience, but fruitfulness under
the rod;</hi> adding his repeated submission, <hi>Gods holy will be done,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his beloved Doctrine of resigning our selves, <hi>not to the
will of God alone, but to his wisdom, both which he was used to say were
perfectly one thing in that blest Agent</hi> (whence his Motto in the most
dismal appearances of Events <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Even this for good.</hi>) His
next observation was of the Circumstances of the allay, <hi>as when it
was the Gout, that it was not the Stone or the Cramp; and when it was the
Stone, it was not as sharp as others felt.</hi> And in the intermission of
his importunate maladies, his third reflexion was a transport of
Thanksgiving (<hi>that he who had in his constitution the cause of so much
pain, should yet by Gods immediate interposing, be rescued from the effect</hi>)
whereby you might discern what a pleasant thing it is to be
thankful, and how eternity may be well spent in <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi>

this, would gladly know the Rules and Principles whereon the
<hi>good man</hi> raised his happy <hi>serenity</hi> and calmness: to satisfie his use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
curiosity, then his first Rule was,<note place="margin">

                  <hi rend="margQuotes">never to trouble himself
with the fore-sight of future events, suficient (<hi>he resolved</hi>) to the
day is the evil thereof, it being (<hi>as he went on</hi>) the greatest folly
in the world, to perplex ones self with that which perchance
would never come to pass: But if it should, then God who sent
it, will dispose it to the best; most certainly to his glory which
should satisfie us in our respects to him: and unless it be our
fault as certainly to our good, which if we be not strangely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
must satisfie in reference to our selves and private
Interests. Besides all this, in the very dispensation God will not
fail to give such allays which (like the cool gales under the Line)
will make the greatest heats of sufferance very supportable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the thing before us (<hi>as he would subjoyn out of</hi> Epictetus) is in
our power, or it is not: if it be, let us apply the remedy, and there
will be no motive for complaint; if it be not, the grief is utterly
impertinent, since it can do no good. For (<hi>this he annexed of the

prove hot, and not to be touched, we may take the other that is
temperate.</hi> His second rule was, to recollect his constant expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences
of Gods dealing with him in precedent Dispensations.
His third was, <hi>quod sis esse velis, nihil<expan>

nothing,</hi> and not only to acquiesce in the present state as most
<hi>necessary,</hi> but to be pleased with it as resolved <hi>the best;</hi> adding his
pretty question to the over-solicitous, <hi rend="margQuotes">when they would begin
to trust God, or permit him to govern the world? whereby the
world and its Appendages hang loose about this unconcerned
<hi>Christian;</hi> that he never took notice when any part <hi>dropped</hi> off or
sate <hi>uneasie.</hi>
                  </hi> His fourth was, the great pleasure he took in a
state of subjection; which, as he said, <hi rend="margQuotes">rescued him from the sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
disquiet and discomposure of choice, and left him nothing but
the easie duty of obedience: yet when he could not discern where
his obligation lay, he addressed himself to God by his own and
his friends Prayer and Fasting, his certain Refuge in this as well
as other Exigents.</hi> A tremulous and doubtful propensity of
minde to both, and neither side being in such disgrace with him,
that he would call it the deliberation of <hi>Buridans</hi> Asse. His fifth
rule was, to keep up a vigorous and lively Devotion, so much his
basiness, that when an irremediable drowziness seized upon him
at Prayers, after a violent haemorrhage (though he returned to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Response amidst his importunate infirmity) he very sadly
resented it, saying, <hi>Alas! this is all the return I shall make to this,
meerly to sleep at Prayers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His last Maxim was, that <hi>suffering</hi> was a <hi>blessing</hi> and a priviledge,
whence these Divine Aphorisms in reference to the publick, then
in a dismal state for its sin and the consequences of it; <hi>That prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
iniquity would not be a deliverance, but the most formidable judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
That the Nation during its pressures was under the Discipline of
God, given up to Satan by a kinde of Ecclesiastical censure; and should
the Almighty dismiss us from his hands, and put us into our own, giving
us up to our selves with a why should you be smitten any more? this were
of all inflictions the most dreadful.</hi> And these his Maxims with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

the desponding sorrows of a friend, <hi>Sept.</hi> 2. <hi rend="margQuotes">Sir, yet there is not

under Gods Discipline; therefore let us adore, bless, and resign
our selves to Gods wisest choice. <hi>And these his resentments of that

were carefully improved for his breeding in all good learning.</p>
            <p>He was sent in his fourteenth year to <hi>Pembroke-hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
There his modesty, pregnancy, and piety soon invited preferment;
He was first made <hi>Scholar</hi> of the House, and after <hi>Fellow,</hi> a little
sooner than either his years or standing in rigor of <hi>Statute</hi> permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but the <hi>Colledge</hi> was impatient, not to make sure of him, by
grafting him firmly into that Society, which had been famous for
many excellent men, but none more than <hi>Brownrig.</hi> When Bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
and Master of Arts, Bachelor and Doctor of Divinity, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Exeter;</hi> adorning as well as deserving his Advancements.</p>
            <p>When King <hi>Iames</hi> (that most learned Prince) was pleased to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> by his Presence, and to make Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises
of Scholars, the best part of his Entertainment; this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
(then a young man) was one of those who were chosen by the
University, to adorn the reception of the King. The part he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
was <hi>Iocoserious</hi> (of <hi>Praevaricator</hi>) a mixture of Philosophy,
with Wit and Oratory. This he discharged to the <hi>admiration,</hi>
more than the <hi>mirth</hi> of the King, and other learned Auditors, who
rejoyed to see such a luxuriance of <hi>wit</hi> was consistent with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency;
that jesting was confined to conveniency and mirth, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with that <hi>Modesty</hi> which became the <hi>Muses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among his learned and accurate performances in publick, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
observe, that when he took the Degree of Bachelor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the Text upon which he chose to Preach his <hi>Laine Sermon</hi> was
Prophetick, and preparatory to his after-sufferings, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis

pious Sermon, he afterwards was to fullfil indeed. <hi>Quod docuit
verbo confirmavit exemplo.</hi> He made his Doctrine good by his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
taking up the Cross of Christ, and following him.</p>
            <p>He was preferred to be Prebend of the Collegiat Church of <hi>Eli,</hi>
by the favor and love of the then Bishop of that Seat, Dr. <hi>Felton,</hi>
a very holy and good man: he had also a good Living at <hi>Barlow,</hi> not

and Cathechising to ordinary capacities: (He oft deplored the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
and want of Catechising:) After that, this great Lamp was set
and shined in a Sphere more proper and proportionate, being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
<hi>Master of Katherine-hall.</hi> Here it was wonderful to see, how
the <hi>Buildings,</hi> the <hi>Revenues,</hi> the <hi>Students,</hi> and the <hi>Studiousness</hi> of
that place increased by the Care, Counsel, Prudence, Diligence, and
Fame of Dr. <hi>Brownrig;</hi> who had such an eye to all, that he oversaw
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:59370:213"/>
none; frequenting the Studies, and examining even younger Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
that they might be incouraged in Learning and Piety. He
kept up very much, as good Learning and good Manners, so the
honor of <hi>Orthodox</hi> Divinity and orderly <hi>Conformity:</hi> He kept to
the Doctrine, Worship, Devotion, and Government in the Church
of <hi>England: which,</hi> he would say, <hi>he liked better and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as he grew older.</hi> If any, out of scruple or tenderness of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
was less satisfied with some things, no man had a more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>heart</hi> or a gentler <hi>hand</hi> to heal them, if worthy, ingenious,
and honest. He would convince, though not convert Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers,
and if he could not perswade them, yet he would pity and
pray for them, drawing all with the silken cords of humanity, the
bands of a mans love. He could endure <hi>differences</hi> among
Learned and Godly men in Opinions, especially sublime and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
without distance in affection. He thought that <hi>Scripture</hi> it
self in some points was left unto us less clear and possitive, that
Christians might have wherewith to exercise both <hi>Humility</hi> in
themselves, and <hi>Charity</hi> towards others. He very much venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the first worthy <hi>Reformers</hi> of Religion at home and abroad:
yet was he not so addicted to any <hi>one</hi> Master, as not freely to use
his own great and mature judgement. He hoped every good
man had his <hi>Retractions</hi> either <hi>actual</hi> or <hi>intentional;</hi> though all had
no time to write them, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> did. He had the greatest <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy</hi>
against those unquiet and pragmatick Spirits, which affect
endless Controversies, Varieties, and Novelties in Religion to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on a Party, and under that Skreen of Religion, to advance
their private Interests in publick Designs. For the <hi>Liturgy,</hi>
though he needed a set Form as little as any, yet he had a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
great esteem of it; 1. For the Honor and Piety of his Martyrly
<hi>Composers.</hi> 2. For its excellent <hi>matter</hi> and prudent <hi>method</hi>
3. For the <hi>good</hi> he saw in it to all sober Christians, the want of
which he saw was not supplyed by any Ministers private Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Preaching. Not that the <hi>Liturgy</hi> is unalterable: but he
judged all such alterations ought to be done by the <hi>publick Spirit.</hi>
As for <hi>Bishops,</hi> he was too Learned a man to doubt, and too ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
to deny the Univerval <hi>Custom</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of the Church of
Christ, in all Ages and places for fifteen hundred years, according
to the <hi>pattern</hi> (at least) received from the <hi>Apostles;</hi> who without
doubt, followed, as they best knew, the minde of Christ. He was
by the favor of K. <hi>Charles,</hi> and the great liking of all good men, made

he wondred Dr. <hi>Brownrig</hi> would be made a Bishop, whom he had
heard sometime declare his judgment against <hi>Episcopacy.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
related to the Bishop, he with some passion replyed; <hi>I never
thought, much less said, as that person hath falsly av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rred. I thank God,
I took the Office of a Bishop with a good Conscience, and so I hope by Gods
mercy, I shall both maintain and discharge it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And howsoever this excellent Bishop enjoyned not the benefit
of the Kings favour and munificence as to his Bishoprick, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Preferment after the <hi>Troubles</hi> of the times, yet he was ever
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59370:213"/>
most unmoveable, royal respects of Fidelity, Gratitude, Love, and
Obedience. Accordingly when <hi>O. P.</hi> with some shew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to him, demanded his judgement in some publick Affairs.
The Bishop with his wonted Gravity and Freedom, replyed: My
Lord, the best counsel I can give, is that of our Savior, <hi>Render unto</hi>
Caesar, <hi>the things that be</hi> Caesars, <hi>and unto God, the things that be
Gods.</hi> With which free Answer <hi>O. P.</hi> was rather silenced then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
            <p>This grave Personage, when forced to retire, was useful to
those that were worthy of him, and knew how to value him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as a <hi>Bishop,</hi> or a <hi>Divine,</hi> or a <hi>Counsellor,</hi> or a <hi>Comforter,</hi> or a
<hi>Friend.</hi> Among those that gave him a Liberal and Noble enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
<hi>Thomas Rich</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> of <hi>Shunning</hi> in <hi>Berk-shire,</hi> desorveth
with honor to be thus Registred, that he was the especial Friend
of Bishop <hi>Brownrig.</hi> Indeed none could be hospitable to him <hi>gratis:</hi>
he always paid for his entertainments by his many excellent <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was alwayes when in health as chearful (as far as the <hi>Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
of the times gave leave) as one that had the <hi>continual Feast</hi> of a
good Conscience; and as content, as if he had a Lords Estate. All
diminutions and indignities which some men put upon so Worthy
and so Venerable a Person, he digested into patience and prayers.
Thus he was in some degree conformable to the <hi>Primitive Bishops,</hi>
which were poor and persecuted, yea to the great Bishop of our
Souls, who for our sake made himself of no reputation.</p>
            <p>About a year before he dyed, he was invited with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and civility to the honorable Society of both the <hi>Temples,</hi> to
bless them, as with his constant residence, so with his fatherly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
and prayers.</hi> To signifie the reality of their Love, and value
to his Lordship, they not only allowed an annual honorary recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
to express their thanks, but they provided handsome
Lodgings, and furnished them with all things necessary, conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and comely for a Person of his Worth. Such as could hear

could not come nigh enough to hear him, had pleasure to stay
and behold him, conceiving they saw a Sermon in his looks, and
were bettered by the Venerable Aspect of so worthy a Person. God
was pleased to exercise him with bodily pains, indispositions, and
distempers, sometimes with fits of the <hi>Stone;</hi> but under all these
God supported him with his grace, as always humble, devout,
and pious, so for the most part sociable, serene, and chearful, till
he had lived to his sixty seventh year.</p>
            <p>He had frequent infirmities a little before his death. He would
often say, <hi>That it was a very cheap time to die, there being so little
temptation to desire life, and so many to welcome death, since he had
lived to see no King in the State, no Bishop in the Church, no Peer in
Parliament worthy of that name.</hi> He only hoped and prayed God
that he would favor him so far as with a <gap reason="foreign">

ten dayes decayed and wasted, he slumbred much, yet had vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant

in <hi>Leicester-shire,</hi> of honest and well-allowed
Parents (his Father being chief Officer of that place
under <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> the Lord of it) was
so inured to seriousnesse and devotion by his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Mother, so improved in learning by his careful School-masters,
and so promising in parts to the more nice observers of him, that
in the fifteenth year of his age, his Master and one Mr.<note n="b" place="margin">Newly come f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Pelset,</hi>
eminent in those parts, agreed together, to perswade his Father
charged with eleven Children besides, to a nearer and an easier
way of his education than <hi>Cambridge,</hi> whereto he was destined,
(being devoted from his infancy to that sacred Calling) under the
last of these Gentlemen, who upon an essay of his fitnesse for the
use of his Studies, undertook he should in seven years be as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
an Artist, Linguist, and Divine, as any University man, his
Indentures being Prepared, his Time being Set, and his Suits Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed,
for the <hi>pleasing,</hi> but <hi>fatal</hi> project, as it fell out to him that
succeeded, when it pleased God (to whose providence the pious
youth solemnly resigned himself in this affair) that Mr. <hi>Nath.</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Who was born at the same time with him.</note>
               <hi>Silby,</hi> Fellow of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge, conceiving a good opinion of
his aptnesse and learning, and hearing the late projected diversion,
set before his elder Brothers eyes, then accidentally at <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
the excellency of an Academical life, with so much advantage,
that falling on his Knees to his Father, he rise not till promising
the Sale of some of his own Inheritance, towards the charge, he
brought the good man to a passionate resolution, for the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
            <p>Where with Mr. <hi>Henry Cholmely</hi> (for many years Partners of one
Lesson, and for as many of one Bed,) he spent two years at his
Fathers sole charge, and four years with his Uncle <hi>Sleigh</hi> of <hi>Darbies</hi>
assistance (who would by no means suffer him, so much against his
own will at two years end, to be Master of that School, whereof
he had been so lately Scholar) when being Master of Arts, and
mentioned by his friend <hi>Cholmleys</hi> Father to the good Earl of <hi>H.</hi>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:59370:216"/>
who well esteemed the Fathers service, and heard as well of the
Sons hopefulnesse; wherefore he demanded, not without some
concern, why he was not preferred in that Colledge, where he
was so much applauded; and being told his Tutor, a person well
known to his Lordship, filled up the place of that County, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him to a resignation of his Fellowship, for an honorable
Relation to his Family, and the assurance of his favour, to whose
place (notwithstand Mr. <hi>Halls</hi> deprecation of the choice to Dr.
<hi>Chadderton,</hi> upon the suddain news of the Earls death, arrived the
second day of their strict Election (saying ingeniously that his
youth was exposed to lesse needs, and more opportunities of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,
than his Tutors more reduced years) he was admitted (the
twenty third year of his age) into a society, newly its self admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the University (writes) he which if it hath any equals, I dare
say hath no superiors for good Order, studious Carriage, strict Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
austere Piety, where he spent six or seven years more,
with such contentment, as the rest of his life hath in vain striven
to yield; his exercises being plausible, especially his Position (for
which he was first noted in the University) that <hi>Mundus Senescit,</hi> a
Position, saith my Author, that was its own confutation, the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
thereof, arguing rather an increase than a decay of parts in
this latter age. His Rhetorique Lecture thronged, till sensible of
his too long diversion from his destined Calling, he entred not
without fear the Sacred Orders; wherein solemn his Performances
in the University-Churches, and useful his Instructions in the
Neighbor-Villages, when Judge <hi>Popham</hi> intrusted with the well

motion, whom he consulted, offered him not so much the pains,
as the government of it; for the acceptance whereof, he with the
Doctor attended the Judge at <hi>London,</hi> when a Messenger in the
Street, delivered him the good Lady <hi>Druryes</hi> Letter, with a tender
of the Rectory of her <hi>Halsted</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which (telling Dr. <hi>Chad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derton,</hi>
that God pulled him by the Sleeve to the East directly, to
that Calling whereto he was destined, and must go indirectly to
by the West; and satisfying the Judge with the recommendation
of Mr. <hi>Cholmeley</hi> to that employment) he accepted chearfully, and
(an Atheist, one <hi>Lilly,</hi> that estranged him from his Patron and
Neighbors, being removed by the Pestilence at <hi>London,</hi> whither he

surprized, and disavowing that learning, referred him to their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
the most eminent whereof was <hi>Costerus,</hi> who having invited
him to the Colledge, at the Gate whereof the party saluted him
with a <hi>Deo gratias,</hi> lost time in a designed discourse of the unity of
the Church, out of which no Salvation; till he satisfied him, he
came not thither, with any doubt of his own Profession, but for
the same of his Learning, and a particular account of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Miracles; in order to which, a weak discourse of Divine and
Diabolical Miracles, a cholerick invective against our Church for
want of Miracles, with many other incident particulars; which Mr.
<hi>Hall</hi> modestly, yet effectually refuted that Father <hi>Baldwyn,</hi> who sate
at the end of the Table, as sorry a Gentleman of his Country (for
all the while he was accosted agreeably to his Habit with a <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio
Vestra</hi>) should depart without further satisfaction, offered
him another Conference next morning, which upon Sir <hi>Edmund
Bacons</hi> intimation of the danger of it, he excused as bootlesse, both
sides being so throughly settled.</p>

Convoy and Night, they passed by the way of <hi>Naumaurs</hi> and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> disabling him
to return upon theirs. He incensed a Sorbonist<note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Of the</hi> Carmelites.</note> Prior so far, that
Sir <hi>Edmund Bacon</hi> winked upon him to withdraw; and in his way to
<hi>Brussels,</hi> describing our Churches and Baptism to some <hi>Italians,</hi> who
thought we had neither in elegant Latine bewrayed him so well,
that he was charged as a Spy, until he told them he was only an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant
of Sir <hi>Edmund Bacon,</hi> Grand-child to the famous Lord Cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cellor
of that name in <hi>England,</hi> travelling under the Protection
of our late Embassador, whom he waited on (not without danger at
<hi>Antwerp</hi> upon a Procession-day, had not a tall <hi>Brabanter</hi> shadowed
him) along the fair River <hi>Schield</hi> by <hi>Vlushing,</hi> where the curiosity of
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:59370:217"/>
visiting an ancient Colleague at <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> parted him from his
Company, whom the Tide would not stay for, and stayed him in
a long expectation of an inconvenient and tempestuous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</p>
            <p>But ten pounds of his small maintenance being detained, a year
and a half after his useful extravagancies, he arose suddenly out of
Bed and went to <hi>London</hi> (upon the Overture of a Preachers place
at St. <hi>Edmunds-bury)</hi> to perswade his Patron to reason, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented
him out of so ungainful a change, and commending
his Sermon at <hi>London</hi> to my Lord <hi>Denny</hi> (who had a great kindness
for him for those little Books sake he writ, as he said, to buy Books)
wished him to wait upon him as he did (when upon Mr. <hi>Gurney</hi> the
Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> his Tutors motion, he had preached so successefully
the Sunday at the Princes<note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>At</hi> Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</note> Court (where his meditations were
veryacceptable) and on the Tuesday following by the Princes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that he gave him his hand, and commanded him his service; and
when his Patron, who knowing he would be taken up, wished
him now at home, gave him an harsh answer about Ministers rate
of Competencies) with welcome, and terms as noble as the mover
for the acceptance of <hi>Waltham,</hi> wherein, and the Princes service; he
setled himself with much comfort and no less respect: his Highness
by his Governor Sir <hi>Thomas Challoner,</hi> offering him honorable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
for constant residence at Court, and his Lord no less ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
for his stay at <hi>Waltham,</hi> where his little<note n="c" place="margin">Delivered without book with the same exactness they were Penned.</note> Catechism
did much good, his three exactly Penned Sermons a week more:
and his select prayer, (without which he never performed any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
from the thirteenth year of his age to his daying day) most
of all.</p>
            <p>During the two and twenty years he continued at <hi>Waltham,</hi>
four eminent Services he went through.</p>
            <p>1. The recovery of <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> Church (to which belonged
a Dean and eight Prebendaries) swallowed up by a wilful Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in a pretended Fee-farm for ever, where being collated Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend
by the Dean of <hi>Windsor</hi> upon his Masters Letters, he discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
counterfeited Seals, Rasures, Interpolations, and Misdates of
unjustifiable evidence, whereupon the Lord <hi>Elmrere</hi> awarded the
Estate to the Church, until revicted by Common-Law; the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
Sir <hi>Walter Leveson</hi> offered him 40<hi>l. per annum;</hi> A special
Verdict at Kings-Bench being declared for them: upon the renewal
of the Suit (his Colleague, in whose name it ran being dead) the
Fore-man of the Jury who vowed to carry it for Sir <hi>Walter,</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day before the tryal, fell mad: His Majesty having upon his
Petition prevented the Projectors of concealment, which a word
that fell from Sir <hi>Walter</hi> intimated) Sir <hi>Walter</hi> offered, first to cast
up his Fee-farm for a Lease. Secondly, to make each Prebends place
<note n="d" place="margin">Ten pound more being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Doctor <hi>Hall</hi> for his pains.</note> 30<hi>l. per annum,</hi> which Composition being furthered by<note n="e" place="margin">Then Dean of <hi>Windsor,</hi> and so Patron of the Church.</note>
               <hi>Spalato,</hi> and only deferred by two scrupulous Prebends till Sir
<hi>Walters</hi> death, the Lord Treasurer confirmed only with some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement

Prebend resigned by the publick-spirited Doctor resigned to one
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:59370:217"/>
Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> who should reside there and instruct that great and long
neglected people.</p>
            <p>2. The attendance in my Lord Viscount <hi>Doncaster,</hi> afterward the
Earl of <hi>Carlisles</hi> most splendid Embassie in <hi>France,</hi> whence retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with much ado after a hard journey by Land, in Company
with his dear <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> and an harder by Sea, he was collated to
the Long-promised Deanery of <hi>Worcester,</hi> which yet the excellent
Dr. <hi>Field</hi> Dean of <hi>Glocester,</hi> was so sure of in the Doctors absence,
that he had brought Furniture for that spacious house.</p>
            <p>3. His Majesties service in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which he performed with
that applause for his Demeanor and Doctrine from Priests and
people, that at his return with the Earl of <hi>Carlisle</hi> before the King
(upon supposition that the Country Divines would supply the
Stage-courses) some envious persons suggested to his Majesty his
compliance with that prejudicate people, whereupon he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a gracious acknowledgement of his service, called to a mild
account; his Royal Master not more freely professing what infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
had been given against him, than his own full satisfaction
with his sincere and just answer, as whose excellent wisdom well
saw that such winning carriage of his could be no hindrance to his
great designs, and required him to declare his judgment in the five
points in<note n="f" place="margin">Which was Printed since in his remains. <hi>p</hi> 306.</note> answer to a Letter of Mr. <hi>W. Strouther</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi>

of those Garrisoned Towns, after some pathetick Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and motions for accommodation: after the expedient (called
<hi>Sintentia 4. Theol. Brit.)</hi> for reconciliation and the Elegant Latine

Lords, and a strong Demurrer stopping that proceeding, one of
those endangered by the Rabble hardly escaping, who one night

he who exercised moderation and patience, as exemplarily as he
recommended them to others pathetically and eloquently, who
often passionately complained of the sacrilegious outrages upon
the Church, but was silent in those unjust ones on himself; who in
the midst of his miseries provided for the Churches Comfort, by
his <hi>Treatises of Consolation;</hi> for its Peace, by the <hi>Peace-maker, Pax

to distressed Widows to his death, and a good sum in the
Place where he was born, and the City where he died after it; for
its Professors, by holy admonitions, counsels, and resolutions;
for its Enemies, by dealing with some of them so effectually, that
they repented, and one among the rest, a great Commissioner, and
Justice of Peace, I mean Esquire <hi>Lucas,</hi> who, though a man of a

great Estate, received Orders at his hands, and recompenced in
injuries to the Church as Committee-man, by being a faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of it to this day; and when he could not prevail with men,

            <p>The Church fared the better for his wrestling Prayers, and the
State for his Holy Vows. One he was of a serene, mild, and calm
aspect, as smooth as his wit and tongue; though living long, but
once a Child in understanding, though always so in humility and
innocence, whereby he suppled those adversaries into a moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that could not be perswaded to a conversion; they observing
his industry neither ceasing nor abating with his preferments, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing
his time as much, and giving account of it as well as any man,
not to his dying day waving any pains agreeable to his Calling, till
forbidden by men, or disenabled by God; when it was observed,

He would not be Buried in the Church, but he Lives in it by his
great Charity, allowing a weekly Contribution to the poor among

attended that Cause that commanded not only the Arms
of the most Valiant, but the Parts of the most Learned;
<hi>these</hi> deserving the Bayes for the vast reason they urged in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties

born <hi>Aug.</hi> 16. 1615. bred at the Kings School in <hi>Westminster,</hi>

the choicest Pens to applaud them; his high abilities were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed
with so much candor and sweetness, that they made him
equally <hi>loved,</hi> and admired; his vertuous modesty attaining the
greatest honor by avoiding <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His soul naturally great and capable, had, he said, three advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to fill it; great spirited Tutors, choice Books, and select
Company; it was his usual saying, That it was his happiness that
he neither heard nor read any thing vulgar, weak, or raw, till
his minde was fixed to notions <hi>exact as reason,</hi> and as <hi>high</hi> as <hi>fancy.</hi>
Its a great care due to our first years, <hi>That generous thoughts be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled

humor of expressing every excellent Piece he saw, and indeed
each brave notion he met with (and he was an exact Collector)
whereby he translated not only brave mens thoughts to his own
words, but their very Heart and Genius to his own constitution
made up of strong Sence, compact Learning, clean, sharp, full,
and sure Wit; brave passions, even and high Language; in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

great parts, and a good carriage, who coming by <hi>White-hall</hi>
when the King was put to death, he laid the horrid fact so to
heart, that coming home to Master <hi>Heywoids</hi> house at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi>
whose Sister he had married, he fell into such an ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that going up immediately into his Chamber, he told his
friends about him (though he was then as well as ever he was in his
life) that he should never stir out of that Chamber alive, as his
heart breaking under the great weight of his grief for the horror
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:59370:225"/>
of the act its self and his thoughts, (for he was a fore-seeing man of
the sadness of the consequence of it) he did not, dying 1649.</p>

Life and Death
Of the Right Honorable,
HENRY SPENCER,
Earl of Sunderland,</head>
            <p>THis Noble Person, whose Ancestor when created
Baron of <hi>Wormeleighton</hi> in <hi>Warwick-shire primo Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobi,</hi>
as he said, for the report of his being the
greatest Moneyed man in <hi>England,</hi> was the fifth
Knight of his Family, in an immediate succession
descended from the <hi>Spencers</hi> Earls of <hi>Gloucester</hi>
and <hi>Winchester,</hi> was himself, when made Earl for
his great merit, in Court and Camp, 19 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. 1643. the thirty
ninth Gentleman bearing arms successively in his house, being
allied as it appeared then to all the Nobility that time at Court,
but Duke <hi>Hamilton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A taunt a Boy gave him when a Child, proved a sober Precept
to him when a Man; and the bare being upbraided that he would
be a wicked and an useless Nobleman, obliged him ever after to
approve himself otherwise: When <hi>Monicaes</hi> St. <hi>Augustines</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Companion called her <hi>Toss-pot</hi> in her anger, it gave her
occasion to be sober and temperate all her life. Bitter Jeers some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
makes wholsom Physick, when God sanctifieth malice to do
the office of good will. Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> having taken so much liberty
in his younger years, as cost him many a sigh in his reduced age,
heard a Tutor in the next Chamber to him chiding a Pupil thus,
<hi>What, will you be such a Bake-hell</hi> as <hi>Perkins?</hi> and immediately upon
it was reclaimed, and the Quick-silver of his extravagant studies
and courses, fixed to a very great improvement.</p>
            <p>Three dayes were very lucky to him, <hi>May 6. Iuly</hi> 11. and <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi>

at <hi>Worcester,</hi> 1658. at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and 1666. at <hi>London.</hi> He had a
Tutor crooked with age, that streightened the manners of his
youth, arming him against those Customs (that are not knocked
but serued into the soul) inuring him to good discourse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
habituating him to temperance and good order, whence
he had the advantage of others, not only in health, but in time
and business: and diverting him with safe, cheap, but manly and
generous Recreations. The result of which Education, was a
knowing and a staid nature that made him a Lamb, when pleased;
a Lion, when angry; daring in the highest tumults, 1640. and 1641.
to give the best Counsel, and to oppose the worst; advising those
that complained that his Majesty was gone away, to lure him
home by their loving behaviour, and not do as those troublesome
women, who by their hideous out-cries drive their wandring
Husbands further off. And when the House of Lords became the
House of Commons, by vile compliances with tumults; when the
Lords to climb up to the peoples favour, trampled on one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the rabble bringing tales, and they belief, he, though se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

so great a punishment, he condemned them for deserving it, often
urging that of <hi>Seneca,</hi> Epist. 80. <hi>Nihil rex male parentibus majus
minaripotest, quam ut abeat de regno.</hi> The last words he spoke in the
Parliament House at <hi>Westminster</hi> were these; <hi>We had been satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
long ere this, if we did not ask things that deny themselves,
and some men had not shuffled Demands into our Propositions, on
purpose that we may have no satisfaction:</hi> He brought 15000<hi>l.</hi> and
1200 men to his Majesties relief, and the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> his
Countey mans assistance; adding to his Estate and Friends, his
Counsel and personal service, wherein in dispute about a rising
ground in the first <hi>Newbery</hi> fight, not far from his Majesty, he fell.
First, a good Patriot upon all other occasions (as one of them at
<hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stminster</hi> observed) promoting the Trade, Manufactures, and
Priviledges of this Countrey, and now standing by his Majesty, as
he evidently saw him stand for his Kingdom, saying (by a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
and Prospect he had of things suitable to the eminence of his
place) that one seven years (Truth is the Daughter of Time) would
shew that the <hi>King</hi> was the true <hi>Common-wealths-man.</hi> Secondly, a
true Nobleman that was vertuous, because it became him, as well
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:59370:226"/>
as because it was injoyned him: being above vice, as well as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, looking upon it as his shame and dishonor, as well as sin and
offence. Thirdly, a good Neighbor, the Country about him
when he had occasion to make use of it, being his friends that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
rather than slaves that <hi>feared</hi> him. Fourthly, a discreet Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
finding wayes to improve his Land, rather than rack his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.
Fifthly, a noble House-keeper, to whom that ingenuity
that he was Master of <hi>himself,</hi> was <hi>welcome</hi> in <hi>others.</hi> Sixthly, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Patron, seldom furnishing a Church with an Incumbent, till
he had consulted the Colledge he had been of, and the Bishop
he lived under. Seventhly, an exemplary Master of a Family, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
exactly the excellent Rules he so strictly injoyned, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating
his house to a Temple, where he ordered his followers to
wrestle with God in Prayer, while he wrestled with the Enemy in
fight; whence those holy thoughts that went as harbingers of his
soul to heaven, whereof he had a glimpse before he died, through
the chinks of a wounded body, when those noble persons, <hi>Sept.</hi>
20. 1643. closed his eyes, that through weeping had hardly any left
themselves; leaving behind him a noble Lord, of whom Dr. <hi>Pierce</hi>
that had the tuition of him, gave this Character, <q>That his choice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of nature, having been happily seasoned and crowned
with grace, gave him at once such a willingness and aptness to
be taught, as reconciled his greatest pains with ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and made the Education of his dear Lord not so much his
imployment, as his Recreation and Reward.</q> And a noble Lady
not to be mentioned without the highest honor in this Catalogue
of Sufferers, to so many of whom her House was a Sanctuary, her
Interest a Protection, her Estate a Maintenance, and the Livings in
her gift a Preferment; among whom the foresaid excellent person

the Monarchy of this kingdom, and he went out of the
world <hi>maintaining</hi> it with his Interest; which was so
great, that the Faction pretended his Concurrence with
them, a passage which puts me in minde of the great power of his
Predecessors, one of whom in <hi>Edward</hi> the first Kings time, hath
this <hi>Memorandum</hi> of Record.</p>
            <p>Memorandum,</p>
            <q>THat <hi>Henry de Piere-point,</hi> on Munday, the day after the <hi>Octaves</hi>
of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> came into the Chancery at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and said
publickly, that he had lost his Seal, and protested, that if any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
were found Sealed with that Seal, after that time, the
same should be of no value or effect.</q>
            <p>Indeed it was his great Services when Sheriff 13. <hi>Iacobi,</hi> and
greater when Justice of Peace, (and King <hi>Iames</hi> in a Speech in Star-Chamber,
valueth a Justice of Peace as much as one of his Privy-Councel,
as it is as much to see Laws and Order kept, as to make
them; and to keep the peace in each part of the kingdom, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
about the peace of the whole) composing differences by his
skill in Law, suppressing disorders by his great reputation, and
promoting the good of his Country, by his large prudence, and
deep insight into things; that as he was honoured with King <hi>Charles</hi>

<hi>Robert de Piere-point</hi> had in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time, but did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
being summoned a Baron in Parliament, and dying before he

and afterwards 4. <hi>Caroli primi,</hi> Earl of <hi>Kingston,</hi> for his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
opinions between the extreams then prevailing in Parliaments,
which he was able to accommodate, as to State Affairs, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
man; and as to Church Affairs, as a Christian, and a
great Scholar. Whence he would commend a general learning
to young Noblemen, upon this ground, because the great variety
of Debates that came before them, wherein the unlearned Gentry,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:59370:227"/>
either rashly offer dangerous proposals to impose on others, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sloathfully rest in a tame yea and nay, being easily imposed on by
others. The effect whereof we found both in his and his hopeful
Son, the now Illustrious Marquess of <hi>Dorchesters</hi> learned and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Defences of the Spiritual Function, and Temporal Honors, and
Imployments of Bishops, 1641/2. which though they could not con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vert
any of the obstinate Anti-episcopal men (not a speech to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
their reason, but a grant to gratifie their interest must effect
that) yet confirmed they the wavering Episcopal party. When it
came to passe in the Civil Wars of <hi>England,</hi> as it had done in those
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Seditious <hi>(Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius)</hi> were followed by
the lower sort of the people, <hi>Ex subditis Romanorum</hi> (saith <hi>Dion</hi>)
while <hi>Caesars</hi> Army consisted, <hi>Ex Romanis nobilibus &amp; sortibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This honorable Person, and his Eldest Son, attended his Majesty,
the Father with the Sword, and the Son with the Pen, more fatal to
the Faction that the Sword; and therefore the first men excepted
out of Pardon, were such excellent Pen-men, as the Lords Viscount
<hi>Newark</hi> and <hi>Faulkland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Hide,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Nicholas,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Endintion Porter,</hi>

person of great concernment to the Kings affaires (the Country
calling him usually the good Earl of <hi>Kingston)</hi> sent towards <hi>Hull</hi> in
a Pinnace, which Sir <hi>Charles Cavendish,</hi> who knew well the value of
that noble person, as well as the enemy, pursued, demanding the
Earl, and when refused, shooting at the Pinnace with a Drake, that
unfortunately killed him and his servant, placed a mark to his
friends shot, who when they took the Vessel, put all the Company
to the Sword, a just, though not a valuable sacrifice to so noble a
Ghost; which King <hi>Charles</hi> the I. would have ransomed at as high
a rate, as his Ancestor <hi>Robert Peire-point</hi> was redeemed in <hi>Edward</hi>
the III. time, who cost that King, when taken at <hi>Lewis,</hi> 700 mark,
the Ransom (as money went in those days) of a Prince, rather than

He was born in the ancient and famous City of <hi>York,
March</hi> 20. 1564. his Parents were of good repute. Mr. <hi>Richard
Morton,</hi> a well known <hi>Mercer,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Elizabeth Leedale</hi> (by whom
the <hi>Valvasours</hi> and <hi>Langdales</hi> acknowledge themselves to be of his

               <hi>Hallifax,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Mr. <hi>Maud</hi> (of whom he always spake with great reverence, as
a grave Man, and a good Scholar) and from thence, 1582. went
to the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> at the eighteenth year of his age,
and there was admitted into St. <hi>Iohns Colledge,</hi> under Dr. <hi>Whitacre,</hi>
wherein were so many eminent Scholars at that time, as he was
wont to say, <hi>It seemed to be a whole University of its self.</hi> His Tutor
was Mr. <hi>Anthony Higgon,</hi> afterwards Dean of <hi>Rippon,</hi> who lest him
to the care of Mr. <hi>Hen. Nelson,</hi> Rector of <hi>Hougham</hi> in <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi>
who lived to see his Pupil pass through all the other Dignities he
had in the Church, till he came to be Bishop of <hi>Duresm,</hi> and a good
many years after.</p>
            <p>Being chosen Scholar of <hi>Constables</hi> Foundation, 1584. In
the year 1590. he took his Degree of Master of Arts, having
performed all his Exercises with great approbation and applause.
Afterwards he continued his Studies in the Colledge at his Fathers
charge for above two years. <hi>March</hi> 17. 1592. he was admitted<note n="d" place="margin">Into Dr. <hi>Ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sons</hi> Foundation.</note>
Fellow, meerly for his worth, against eight Competitors for the
place; which he was wont to recount with greater contentment
to himself, than his advancement to any Dignity he ever enjoyed
in the Church. About the same time he was chosen Logick Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
for the University, which place he discharged with much art
and diligence, as appears by his Lectures found among his Papers
fairly written.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:59370:228"/>
In the same year he was admitted to the Order of Deacon, and
the next after, of Priesthood. Having received his Commission
from God and the Church, he was very ready to assist others in the
way of charity; but not too forward to take upon him the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
care of souls. And accordingly we finde him for the space of
five years after this, continuing in the Colledge, prosecuting his
own private Study, and reading to such Scholars as were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Care and Tuition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1598. He took his Degree of Bachelor of Divinity, and
about the same year, being Presented, Instituted, and Inducted to
the Rectory of <hi>Long-Marston,</hi> four miles distant from his native Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>York,</hi> he betook himself wholly to the cure of Souls there
committed to him, which he discharged with great care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;
and yet he did not intermit his higher studies, the general
good of the Church, while he attended it. To that end he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
kept some person to be his Assistant, whom he knew to<note n="a" place="margin">Generally his own Pupils, as Mr. <hi>Jo. Pierce,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendary of <hi>Leichfield,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Level</hi> of <hi>Durham.</hi>
               </note> be
pious and learned. And this assistance was more necessary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his great parts and worth would not suffer him to enjoy his
privacy in a Country cure. For first, he was made choice of by the
Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> then Lord President of the North, to be his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
for his dexterity and acuteness, in disputing with the Romish
Recusants; for it was Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> express command to that
Lord, to convince them by arguments rather than suppress them
by force; and this She expressed (as his Lorship was wont to say)
in the words of the Prophet, <hi>Nolo mortem peccatoris.</hi> But the Earl
dying presently after, he returned to his privacy at <hi>Marston,</hi> where
he continued not long, before the Lord <hi>Sheffield</hi> (who succeeded
as Lord President) commanded him to hold a publick Conference
before his Lordship, and the Council, at the Mannor-house in <hi>York,</hi>
with two<note n="b" place="margin">Master <hi>Young</hi> a Priest, and Mr. <hi>Stillington</hi> a Layman.</note> Romish Recusants, then Prisoners in the Castle;
which he performed with great satisfaction to the Auditory, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom were many of the chief Gentry and Clergy of <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1602. Began the great Plague at <hi>York,</hi> at which time he
carried himself with much <hi>Heroical Charity.</hi> For the Poor being
removed to the Pest-house, he made it his frequent use to visit
them with food, both for their <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Souls.</hi> His chief Errand
was to comfort them, pray for them, and with them; and to make
his coming more acceptable, he carried with him a Sack of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>
usually for them that wanted it. And because he would not
have any body to run any hazard thereby but himself, he seldom
suffered any of his Servants to come near him, but sadled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadled
his own Horse, and had a private door made on purpose
into his House and Chamber.</p>
            <p>In the year following, he with Dr. <hi>Cracanthorp,</hi> attended the
Queens Embassador, the Lord <hi>Ewre,</hi> into <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
desirous to improve himself by seeing forraign Kingdoms,
Churches, and Universities. In this Voyage he improved his time
so well, partly in furnishing his <hi>Library</hi> with Books at <hi>Frankfort</hi> and
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:59370:229"/>
elsewhere, but chiefly in his conversation with<note n="g" place="margin">Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Father <hi>Mulhufi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who gave him a book of his own with this Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>domino Mortono Nich.

men, and his forraign Observations, that he always highly valued
that opportunity. At his return he was sollicited by <hi>Roger</hi> Earl of
<hi>Rutland</hi> to be his Domestical <hi>Chaplain;</hi> which proffer he was more
willing to accept for the privacy he hoped to enjoy in a place
where he was not known, for making use of the <hi>Treasure of Books</hi>
he had got in his <hi>Travels,</hi> and rather, because he was brought so
much nearer <hi>London</hi> than before, whither he must have many
occasions to go, for the putting forth of such Books as he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to write. For it was not long after that he printed his first part
of <hi>Apologia Catholica.</hi> About which time the Arch-bishop of <hi>York,
Toby Matthews</hi> (that most exquisite Preacher) conferr'd upon him
a <hi>Prebend</hi> in that Metropolitical Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno.</hi> 1606. He took the Degree of Doctor in Divinity, with the
great approbation of both Professors in Divinity, Dr. <hi>Iohn Overall</hi>
that profound Scholar, and Dr. <hi>Thomas Playford</hi> that acute Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and acurate Preacher, who were both of them very compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Judges of mens abilities. And about the same time he was
sworn <hi>Chaplain in Ordinary</hi> to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and by him made <hi>Dean</hi>
of <hi>Glocester,</hi> and assumed by the Lord President of <hi>Wales</hi> for one of
his Majesties <hi>Council</hi> for the Marches. In his first journey to <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi>
he went by <hi>Oxford</hi> at the <hi>Act-time,</hi> where he was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
and admitted to the same Degree that he had in <hi>Cambridge,</hi>
where also he was much taken with the exercises of Mr. <hi>Daniel
Featly</hi> then a proceeder, and carryed great Friendship to him ever
after. At which time he fell into acquaintance with that famous
Dr. <hi>Iohn</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">As he did with Dr. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> of Christ-Church Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Dr. <hi>Airey</hi> of Queens.</note>

            <p>The chief <hi>Legacy</hi> of his <hi>Will</hi> must not be omitted, the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>His high esteem of the <hi>Sacred Liturgy</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi>
attended him, he ordering it, which he called the best Funeral
Sermon, at his Burial (as I may say) to his Grave. Great Fervor
and Devotion he shewed in the <hi>Church-prayers;</hi> yea, so great, that
he seldom answered with a single <hi>Amen.</hi> At Prayers he never
kneel'd upon a <hi>Cushion,</hi> and always prayed upon his <hi>Knees,</hi> till he
was confined to his Death-bed, and even would never lye with his
<hi>Cap</hi> on his <hi>Head,</hi> if either he prayed himself, or others prayed by
him, while he had strength to pull it off with his own hands. Great
Consolation he took in the <hi>Church-preparations</hi> for his Long Home,

a great number of years, and very few husbanded their time
better, for he was <hi>never idle</hi> with his good will. He was often at
his Devotion and Study before four of the clock, even after he had
lived above fourscore years; and yet very seldom went to Bed till
after ten; and then had always a Servant to read some book to
him, till such time as sleep did surprize him.</p>
            <p>And so had he always, when he travelled in his Coach, that his
Journey might not be too great a hindrance to his Study. He used
to lye on a <hi>Straw-bed,</hi> till he was above fourscore, and the Cramp
hindred him.</p>

            <p>To add somewhat of his Character.</p>
            <p>1. His <hi>Patience.</hi> In the greatest tryal of his temper that he had;
the News of the Vote, That the Revenues of the Church were
to be sold, he only said: <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken
away; Blessed be the Name of the Lord;</hi> which he repeated three
times over to the Company that he was in, and presently retired
himself to his prayers.</p>
            <p>2. His <hi>Hospitality.</hi> He entertained the King and his Court, and (at
least) the chief Officers of his Army all at one time in the first Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
toward <hi>Scotland,</hi> which (in that place of great cheapness)
cost him 1500<hi>l.</hi> in one day. There seldom came any Scholar to
him, Forraign or English, whom he did not liberally entertain and
dismiss with a considerable sum of money.</p>
            <p>3. His <hi>Beneficence.</hi> He built a Free-school at <hi>Bishops-Aukland,</hi>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:59370:232"/>
and endowed it with 24<hi>l. per annum,</hi> which is more than he ever<note n="b" place="margin">Where of one Loe of a good memory was one, against whose Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity be writ a large L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

purchased to himself, for that was just nothing; besides that, he
maintained several at his own charge in the Colledge. He gave
many excellent Books to the Colledge where he had his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the value of 4. or 500<hi>l.</hi> with an intention at last to bestow
100<hi>l. per annum,</hi> during his life (had not the times disabled him)
<hi>to buy Books of special worth, and not for superf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. His <hi>Alms-giving.</hi> While he was suffered to enjoy his Estate, he
had his <hi>Badg-men</hi> and Livery at a constant Table, besides what he
gave at his Gate, and upon other occasions; nay, so constant was
he in this duty, even when he had so much left, as to afford Bread
for his own Mouth, that he had always a certain number of poor
impotent persons in a constant Pension, that came Weekly to him
for their Allowance, when he was not able to go himself among
them to give it; and this will be abundantly testified by the poor
in all places where of late he hath lived.</p>
            <p>5. His <hi>Devotion.</hi> He would often forgo, or at least much mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
his one Meal a day, often deny himself some part of that small
pittance allowed for sleep, to rise of his Bed, and to spend in
Prayer, as the Attendance in his Chamber witness.</p>
            <p>6. His <hi>Prudence,</hi> in the moderation of his Passions, wherein all
moral virtues are knit together, by which he was a pattern to his
people of good works, and an unblameable life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
            <p>7. His <hi>Mind</hi> above the <hi>World,</hi> and its filthy lucre.</p>
            <p>8. His <hi>Vote</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> &amp;c. according to Conscience, and not
either Interest or Humor.</p>
            <p>9. His <hi>Great Moderation</hi> in the <hi>Quin quar ticular</hi> Controversie,
about which he would declare nothing.</p>
            <p>13. His grave and sober Speech, his sweet and grave Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
his decent Habit, his upright and sprightful Motion, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
Youth in old age.</p>
            <p>11. His <hi>Temperance,</hi> using Wine only at Meals, unless it were for
his stomack sake, and his often infirmities.</p>
            <p>12. The Excellent Government of his Family, into which seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Persons of Quality, as the Sons of the Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Fairfax</hi> (whose Son Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was his Gentleman-Usher) desired
to be admitted for Education.</p>
            <p>13. His <hi>Industry,</hi> so great, as if his labours were (as it is said of
his Kinsman, Arch-bishop <hi>Morton) his Recreation;</hi> and his Motto
<hi>Severus</hi> his (who died at <hi>York,</hi> where this Bishop was born,) <hi>Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remus;</hi>
or <hi>Iulius Maximinus, Quo major eo laboriosior.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>14. His <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> the most grave and learned men of our
own and forreign Churches, <hi>Spanhemius, Rivet, Willius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>15. His <hi>Retainers</hi> and <hi>Chaplains,</hi> the most Eminent men in either
University, and Bishop <hi>Brownrig</hi> was one of them, made by him
Arch-deacon of <hi>Coventry,</hi> and Prebendary of <hi>Durham;</hi> the last of
which preferments he held in <hi>Commendam,</hi> with his Bishoprick, till
he died.</p>
            <p>16. His aptness to teach by every thing he did, like <hi>Socrates,</hi>
whom he resembled in another particular, <hi>in that he usually confuted
his Adversaries always out of something they granted.</hi>

Dr. <hi>Swinborne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Theoph. Higgens,</hi> and twelve eminent Papists
more.</p>

            <p>19. His affable virtues and parts.</p>
            <p>20. His extraordinary, though secret mortification; all which
virtues, and performances rendred him a Saint in his life, a Doctor
in his works, a Confessor in his sufferings, and a Martyr in his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Dr. THOMAS COMBER,
Dean of Carlisle.</head>
            <p>DOctor <hi>Thomas Comber,</hi> Son of <hi>Comber Clarenciaux</hi> King of
Armes, was born at <hi>Shermanbury</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> on <hi>New-years-day,</hi>
and Baptized on the day of <hi>Epiphany,</hi> 1575. the
twelfth Child of his Father, as <hi>Bellarmine, Baronius, Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetus,</hi>
and many eminent men were, who were the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
off-spring of their decayed Parents.</p>
            <p>His first Education was at <hi>Horsham</hi> in the same County, under a

               </gap> who studying his meek, but active tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as much as he did his Books; rather mildly led, than severely
drive him; to whom a frown was as bad as correction, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
as bad as death, whose great industry, and happy memory
taking in all the learning instilled into him, and retaining all he
had taken in (twice reading sufficing him to gain any piece of an
Author, at eight years of age) furnished him with so much skill in
Greek and Latine <hi>Poetry, History,</hi> and <hi>Oratory,</hi> as with Mr. <hi>Titch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burns</hi>
his exemplary Tutors improvement of him in Hebrew, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack,
Arabick, besides Logick, Ethicks, and a smattering in the
Mathematicks, recommended him, after three years continuance
in <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where he was admitted to Dr. <hi>Nevill,</hi>
then intent upon planting a good Nursery in that Colledge (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that learning propagates by example, and one good Scholar
begets another, as one lights his Candle at the Candle of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour)
to be Scholar and Fellow of the Royal Foundation.</p>
            <p>Where his proficiency was the effect 1. Of St. <hi>Bernards</hi> method,
which was written upon many of his Books; <hi>ut Legeret Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,
fecit cupidites, ut Intelligeret oratio Impetravit; ut Impetraret quid
(nisi vitae sanct it as promeruit; sic cupiat, sic orat, sic &amp; vivat, qui se
proficere desiderat.</hi> 2. The industry he commended to others in
these Instructions, <gap reason="foreign">

sewer that takes in all temptation: employ your selves well, or you will be
employed ill.</hi> 3. And the good example of other Students, and
he would use often that of <hi>Seneca, &amp; magnum est quod a sapiente vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

in Hebrew, Arabick, Coptick, Samaritane, Syriack, Chaldee, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,
Greek, Latine, French, Spanish, and Italian, and well versed
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:59370:234"/>
in the Greek and Latine Fathers, Schoolmen, Councels, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Writers. (Great Abilities very much sweetned by his great
Modesty and Humility) appeared first an exellent Tutor, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Pupils rather as Friends and Companions, than Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
stealing his vast Learning to them by Discourse and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
rather than inculcating it by Set-Lectures; and training
them up to vertue and knowledge, by his example more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
than others did by Precepts, giving this reason for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to other Tutors, <hi>That young men admitted to the Company of
those that were their Seniors, would be decoyed into excellency, being
ashamed to speak or do any thing below the Company they kept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then a <hi>melting Preacher,</hi> preaching as much by his silent and
grave Gesture, composed to a smiling sweetness, as by his learned
and honest Sermons; <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. After that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
filled his own Country with his hopes and name, he travelled
three years secured from the Vices of foraign Nations, by his chast
gravity, and sage prudence; and very capable of their vertues by
<hi>exact Observations, and good Company,</hi> being all the while he was in
<hi>France</hi> at the house of the Judicious, Learned, and Religious <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
Moulin,</hi> the <hi>Buckler</hi> of the Protestant profession. <hi>Frequent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes</hi>

in publick with the Divines there, who admired him much for
his solid quickness and various Learning:) <hi>Holy Conference,</hi> the
fruit whereof was the conversion of several Jews (the good effect
of Oriental Learning) and particularly, one <hi>Bardesius</hi> by name,
whom he convinced that it was impossible to maintain the truth

by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Chaplain to his Majesty;

mens studies should be methodical and useful, examining private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their Proficiencies, and looking publickly to their Exercises,
taking care to dispose of them all, according to their respective
capacities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1631/2. He was Vice-chancellor of the University, where he
was very strict in observing the Statutes, very watchful over the
publick performances; the <hi>jocose,</hi> that they should not be too loose
or abusive; the <hi>serious,</hi> that they should not be too perfunctory,
and the Religious (whether Sermons, Prayers, or Disputations)
that they should not be (what they were but too apt to be) too Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious;
witness the dangerous Position of Mr. <hi>Bernard</hi> Lecturer of
St. <hi>Sepulchres</hi> at St. <hi>Maries,</hi> which he speedily reported to Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
<hi>Laud,</hi> and vigorously prosecuted in the High-commission:
The Articles were these (for otherwise he often absented himself
from the Consistory when they made a man an <hi>offendor for a word.</hi>)
<hi rend="margQuotes">1. That Gods Ordinances blended with the Innovations of men,
cease to be Gods Ordinances. 2. That it is impossible to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without repentance for being of it.
3. That reason is not limited to the Royal bloud; and that he is
a Traytor against a Nation, that depriveth it of its Ordinances,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. That those who shamefully symbolize with the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> as some among us do in Pelagian Errors, and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Ceremonies, are to be prayed either to their Conversion, or
to their Confusion.</hi>

            <p>But a while after these and other Principles which he thought
fit to punish, others thought fit to practice, whereupon having in

constantly, <hi>Very well, I thank God;</hi> so great the peace of a good

after crying <hi>Nunc Dimittis,</hi> and desiring to be dissolved,
and to be with Christ; only he sent, just as he was a dying, to his
dear Consorts ancient Parents, and an aged friend in the Town,
to prepare for death, telling them and his loving Wife, that he
should be loath to be happy without them; suggesting to her
likewise, that when she saw him close his eyes, she should not be
troubled, but conceive that he was fallen asleep. He was bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Dr. SAMUEL COLLINS,
Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge.</head>
            <p>WHen I observe one Star exactly in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
others at first sight not so discernable,
offer themselves to my observation; taking
the character of the foregoing eminent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ight
in the University of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> others that
<hi>shined</hi> equally with him in the same <hi>Orb,</hi> and
suffered as eminent an Eclips, appeared; as
1. Dr. <hi>Samuel Collins</hi> (Son of Mr. <hi>Baldwin Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,</hi>
called for his piety, pains, and bountiful Almes-giving, by
Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Father Collins</hi>) was born, <hi>August</hi> 5. (a day obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
to him in many passages of his life) 1570. at <hi>Eaton,</hi> where he
was bred; and whence, after nine years study under a severe
School-Master (whom yet sensible, how seasonably that severity
fixed his too nimble nature, thanked that School-Master as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
as his predecessor Dr. <hi>Whitacre,</hi> who when his Tutor took
his Doctors Degree under him, thanked him publickly, <hi>for giving
him frequent Correction</hi>) with an admirable proficiency, by reason
(as he would say himself) of emulation and ambition, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
him to learn; by the example of some leading Boys, that
his Master kept in each Form to draw on the rest; and to use his
own word, <hi>to Co-extend their souls;</hi> by a natural Memory improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Art, taught him by his Father, and by his great phancy, which
helped him to a deep notion, and lively similitude of things, and
so to a more retentive memory of them.</p>
            <p>A natural eloquence and facetiousness, symbolizing with, and
so more tenacious of any Elegancy he ever met with, in any Poet
or Orator; especially, in his beloved <hi>Ovid</hi> and <hi>Pindar, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ully</hi> or <hi>Iso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi>
and the modern <hi>Ciceronians,</hi> as <hi>Longolius, Bembus, Politian,</hi>
&amp;c Some pieces of whom he read yearly to his dying day, giving
this reason for it to the young men, whom he advised to do the
like, <hi>Iisdem nutrimur, ex quibus constamus,</hi> those Authors enlarge
and quicken our parts, that first moulded and formed them; and a
decaying soul like a decaying body, should go to its native air, and
congenial author, to recover its self. He was chosen Fellow by
Dr. <hi>Roger Goad,</hi> who upon his smart Translation of a piece in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

at the Election (and by the way, he would say, he improved
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:59370:236"/>
himself much by translating himself, taking notice how others
translated one Language into another, and observing the Idiotisms
and proper Elegancies of each Author and Language) clapping his
Hand on his Head, and against six eminent Competitors, saying,
<hi>This is my Child, that if he lives</hi> (wise men dwell next door to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets)
<hi>shall be my Heir and Successor;</hi> As he was 1615. being
chosen Provost, and 1621. Regius Professor of Divinity, having
deserved well of the Church, both by his excellent discourse
against the Papists, and his accurate Sermon 1608. at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> about
the Non-conformists, upon 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3, 4, 5. Of the former of
whom he converted seven, and of the latter sixteen, by reason of
his admirable wit and memory, which he would say, <hi>Was a mans
learning</hi> (for <hi>quantum memini, tantum scio</hi>) he was the most <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>luent
Latinist of our age; Disputants encountring the torrent of his
eloquence, with no better success, than <hi>Caligula's</hi> Souldiers did,
upon his Command with the Tide; as clear, as fluent, not desiring
to be thought deep, because muddy and dark: Not at all affected
with the endless disputes of our Times, which any <hi>Sciolist</hi> may
move, but the best Scholars cannot end, about Predestination, and
the other busie Articles, determining one day on the one side in
those points, and the next day on the other, as the Disputants put
up their Positions; telling his amazed Auditors, that both sides in
those intricate Disputes, however, aggravated by zeal and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
were, if rightly understood, agreeable with the Analogy of
Faith. He would neither multiply needless Controversies, nor
compound necessary ones, being resolute and stable in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
those his fixed Poles and Axeltree about which he moved,
while they stood immovaeble; not tossed to and fro, with <hi>pro</hi>
and <hi>con,</hi> upon the sea of Controversies, as some others, so long, as
the very ground seemed to move to him, and his judgment grow
sceptical and unstable, in the most settled points of Divinity,
though he brought some controversies near together, as those
mountains in <hi>Wales,</hi> whose hanging tops come so close together,
that Shepherds on the tops of several Hills may audibly talk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Being no curious searcher of nice Questions, no cunning Sector,
(as <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> who had that name for his desire to Study, and
examine the least differences) remembring very well that Captain
<hi>Martin Forbisher</hi> fetched from the farthest Northern Countries a
ships lading of Mineral Stones (as he thought) which afterwards
were cast out to mend the High-ways.</p>
            <p>He defeated as well as escaped the arguments brought against
him, not only putting by the thrust but breaking the weapon;
knowing well otherwise, that though he might shut the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
mouth, he might open the difficulty the wider in the hearts
of the hearers; but he either fairly resolved the doubt, or shewed
the falseness of the argument, by beggering the Opponent to
maintain such a fruitful generation of absurdities, as his argument
had begotten; or lastly, retorts it back upon him again. The first
way unties the knot, the second cuts it asunder, and the third
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:59370:237"/>
whips the Opponent with the knot himself tied. He always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
a clear Answerer above a cunning Opposer, because the
latter takes advantage of mans ignorance, which is ten times more
than his knowledge.</p>
            <p>He knew that all arguments for errors were resolved into a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,
and therefore he used every time to urge a new fallacy, that
the young Divines might be used to answer them; so dissembling
himself, truths foe to be her better friend, with <hi>Ioseph,</hi> having suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
sifted the matter in a disguize, he discovered himself; <hi>I
am</hi> Joseph <hi>your Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As his Latine was pure and elegant, making a smooth way over
the <hi>Alps</hi> of Philosophy, and School-divinity (using only such
Thread-bare School-terms, as were Standers, fixed to the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie,
to take off the covert fallacy might have under the Nap of
flourishing Language) so was his English plain when he came to
Preach, especially to a plain Auditory, with the <hi>Paraclesians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
Oyl out of the driest and hardest bodies; knotty Timber
being unfit to build with, he edified his people with profitable and
plain matter. His three Spurs to virtue, were <hi>Satyr, Sarcasm,</hi> or <hi>Irony,</hi>
and <hi>Panegyrick;</hi> by the two first shaming the ill-inclined, and by
the last encouraging the well-disposed: It was observed of him,
that as his Tickets, giving notice of his Reading on the School-doors,
for forty years were never two together alike, without some
considerable difference in the Critical Language thereof; so his
Reparties were never upon two men the same, nor twice alike up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one man. He escaped being Bishop of <hi>Bristol,</hi> which some
Courtier, who would prefer him downward, procured him out of
spight, by his Friends: He<note n="a" place="margin">With him were turned out Doctor <hi>Charles Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his other preferments, out of necessity by his Foes; who had
made the times such, that it was easie to finde new Masters, and
new Preachers, but not so new Professors. Intreating them, after
he had complemented them out of a long time, to consider of the
Covenant, to <hi>take</hi> his Preferments if they would, for he would
never <hi>take</hi> their Covenant; being so happy in his Panegyrick,
wherein only he over-did; that he flattered two of the Committee
into Proselites to his persecuted Opinion, right like the Primitive
Martyrs, that smiled their very Persecutors into a Conversion, to
undergo that very Martyrdom for afflicted Christianity, that they
were ready to inflict. He died about 1651. being a Person of
small stature, and therefore the more vigorously actuated by his
great soul, whose faculties, like Beams contracted, are the more
active and strong; leaving Esquire <hi>Collins,</hi> his accomplished Son
(a worthy Member of the present Parliament) Heir to his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,

Trustees that made an advantage of the Doctors wary and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

much strength, as he had lost thereby:</hi> And with the same Dr.

the Scene of his renowned performances while he was alive,
and the Grave of his virgin body, when dead. There he filled not
the Peoples ears with empty noise, but ravished their Hearts with

which awed Impiety, comforted the Religious, was the
delight of good Men, and a pleasant song even to Hypocrites;
being followed by all sort of people (who delighted in him, not as

as he had, with much ado obtained leave of the modest Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
himself (who never Printed any thing, but one single Sermon,
and that not till a third Command from his Majesty (who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
was very conscientiously observant of his least Order) that
Pamphlet, called by the Transcriber, <hi>The Valley of Vision;</hi> a Valley
indeed, not for the fruitfulness, but for the lowness (especially if
compared to the pretended Authors high parts) but little vision)
Printed them with that care, that became an ingenious man, who
reverenced the memory of the Author, who was by Relation his
Uncle, in Affection his Father, in Favours his Patron, in his Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Studies his Tutor, and in his Ecclesiastical his Compass.</p>
            <p>Entring on his Lectures 1630. with great expectation, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
them for eight years above it, his own Colledge St. <hi>Iohns</hi>
Voted him Master; (and when the perversness of some, and the
prevalency of others, defeated the Colledge of that Vote, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
whereof his own modesty declined) <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge gained
him at once, the most obliging, and the most resolute Master, that
ever was in that House, old Dr. <hi>Chadderton,</hi> that had resigned to
<hi>Preston,</hi> and survived two Masters, saying, <hi>That he was the only Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
that ever he saw in that House;</hi> and he carrying it so civilly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the old Doctor, that he did nothing, and went no whither
about Colledge Affairs, without Father <hi>Chadderton</hi> on his right
hand, telling him, <hi>That as long as he lived he should be Master in the
House, though he himself was forced to be Master of the House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Until opposing the torrent of the late Civil Wars, as Vice chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
for three years together, by Preaching Loyal Sermons at St.
<hi>Maries,</hi> by Licensing his Majesties Declarations to the Press, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing
evil Principles, and propagating good ones, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
Supplies to the King to suppress the Rebellion, and by
denying any to the Faction to maintain it, he was advised to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
himself from that Tumult, which it was in vain to contend
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:59370:239"/>
with; as he did, first to the Country, and then to <hi>London</hi> (the best
Hiding-place in the kingdom) where being concealed a while, God
Almighty thinking it not fit, that so great a virtue should, in a
time when there was so much need of it, be hid, and drawing it out
to be as exemplary in its sufferings, as it had been in its other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
he fell by accident, as he walked an evening, into their
hands whom he desired to avoid; for being known by a Captain of
one of those Guards that Watched each Street and Corner, he was
brought before a Close-Committee, and Committed by them, first
to <hi>Ely-house</hi> (this prophane War turning Noblemens Palaces into
Prisons, as it did afterwards Gods Houses into Stables) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
to increase the charge, as well as the severity of his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment,
to lessen both his Liberty and Estate, to the <hi>Tow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r,</hi> which
he called <hi>Davids Tower</hi> for four years together, where Archbishop
<hi>Laud</hi> sent particularly to this excellent person for his Prayers a
little before his death; and whence, not without a great sum of
money, and as great intercession of friends, on condition not to
stir above twenty miles out of the City, to enjoy only his choice
Library, that escaped their fury, and his Parish in the City, his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the University, and a good Parsonage bestowed upon him
by the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> being kept from him, the Title of <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret
Professor</hi> (but the bare Title without the Profits and Emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Place) to which the unanimous consent of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
Voted him, in the face of his enemies, in his absence, and
in his affliction.</p>
            <p>Neither lasted these Injoyments long, for not being able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
<hi>the Men,</hi> (so sacred to him was his Majesties Cause and Person,
when they had the Impudence to Vote no more Addresses to the
King) for a smart Sermon against them, he is put, as well as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
into <hi>safe Custody</hi> by the Juncto; who Declared, That either
he must be forbid the Pulpit, or they must forbear their Seats; he
being able, they said, to overthrow in an hour, what they had been
carrying on several years. But he continued performing Divine
Service, and Preaching as long as he had liberty, thought-full of
mens souls, and his charge of them; regardless of his own person,
and the calamities of that: He was more afraid of St. <hi>Pauls, Wo is
me, if I Preach not the Gospel,</hi> than of St. <hi>Pauls Chain,</hi> or of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Bonds.</hi> The Life he lost, he found; and the more he despised
Liberty, the more he injoyed it: Abroad he comes, the King writes
for him, and his other Chaplains, to come to him to <hi>Holdenby,</hi> and
is refused; but at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> the reasonable request was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there, he that would not accept of the Bishoprick of <hi>Bristol,</hi>
because he might with the more advantage, being no Bishop, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send
Episcopacy, accepted of the Deanery of <hi>Worcester;</hi> a bare
Title without profit, to shew he waved not that Bishoprick for its
little Revenue (saying (as some said of him) that he would not
take a Bristol-stone) when he took a dignity with none.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> he made bold to ask his Majesty, <hi>Whether he
thought himself safe with those men?</hi> (meaning <hi>Cromwell,</hi> &amp;c.) and
was answered by his Majesty, <hi>Yeas, if they have any souls?</hi> The
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:59370:240"/>
Monsters of Men having with Hands on their Breasts, and Eyes lift
up to Heaven, pawned their Souls and their Posterity upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration.</p>
            <p>As he had attended his Majesty at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> to comfort him,
so with several other Divines he waited on him at the Treaty in
the <hi>Isle of Wight</hi> to assist and serve him, in offering expedients for
moderation, till all moderate men were hurried to Prisons, and
the most innocent Majesty to the Block; whose Murther affected
him so much, that he was never well after, either in body or mind.</p>
            <p>O what Fasts, what Watchings, what Tears, that unheard of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany
cost the good man, till a Black Jaundice prevailed over his
whole body; and thence an humor, that could neither be dispelled
nor mitigated, settled into a Swelling about his Throat, which with
a slow Ague, arising from the Inflammation of the foresaid Tumor,
let out his sick soul, that could say, <hi>The hand of God was light upon
him, and that he had never tasted a sweeter Cup.</hi>

1649. saw him dying a Confessor; weeping for <hi>Charles</hi> the
First, and expecting <hi>Charles</hi> the Second; lamenting the present,
and hoping for the ancient state of things in Church and State:
Insomuch, that when some comforted him, <hi>That he should be taken
away from the evil to come: No no,</hi> answered he, somewhat more
vehemently than ordinary, <hi>I fore-see, I fore-see from the good things
to come.</hi> He departed, praying for those things we now injoy;
wishing well to all men, and desired of most.</p>
            <p>Being a man of a neat personage, convenient stature, a comely

Life and Death
OF
Dr. EDWARD MARTIN,
Dean of Ely.</head>
            <p>DOctor <hi>Edw. Martin,</hi> who had six Ancestors in a direct line,
learned before him, &amp; six Libraries bequeathed to him,
though inclined to any thing more than learning; <hi>Yet,</hi>
as he would say, <hi>was he Hatched a Scholar, as Chickens are
at</hi> Gran-Cairo, by the very heat of the Family he was
related to; his parts, as his nature, inclining to Solidity, rather than
Politeness; he was for the exact Sciences, Logick and Mathematicks
in his Study, as he was for strict Rules in his Conversation. His exact
obedience to publick establishments in his own person, raised him
to a power and trust to see them obeyed by others, being incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
well skilled in the Canon, Civil, and Common Law, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as far as concerned the Church in general, and in the Statutes
of the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> in particular; to be bred under a
good Governor, is the best step to be one; he was therefore first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

1627/8. Chaplain to Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> and thence preferred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>Queens</hi> Colledge, and Rector of—Government is an Art
<hi rend="margQuotes">above the attainment of every ordinary Genius; and requires a
wider, a larger, and a more comprehensive soul, than God hath
put into every body;</hi> he would never endure men to mince and
mangle that in their practice, which they swallowed whole in
their Subscriptions: owning a well-regulated and resolved zeal
in himself, and incouraging it in others; for (to use<note n="a" place="margin">Dr. South <hi>on Tit.</hi> 2. ult.</note> an excellent
Persons expression in a Sermon, whereof our Doctor was a Copy)
<hi rend="margQuotes">not to support men in the ways of an active Conformity to the
Churches rules, he knew would crack the sinews of Government
by weakning the hands, and damping the spirits of the obedient.
And if only scorn and rebuke shall attend men for asserting the
Churches dignity, many will choose rather to neglect their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
safely and creditably, than to get a broken pate in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
service, only to be rewarded with that which will break
their <hi>hearts too.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although he was so resolvedly honest, and upon such clear
Principles conscientious, that he <hi>tired</hi> the persecutions of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and out-lived the neglect of his friends, finding the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
flowing <hi>from</hi> his duty, out-ballancing the sufferings <hi>for</hi> it.</p>
            <p>1. When Chaplain, much troubled by Arch-bishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> Sir

to Ship-board, and thence to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> with the same disgrace and
torment I mentioned before in Dr. <hi>Beals</hi> life, for being active in
sending the University-Plate to the King, and in undeceiving peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
about the proceedings of the pretended Parliament, <hi>i. e.</hi> in
sending to the King that which should have been plundred by his
enemies: and preaching as much for him as others did against
him; his sufferings were both the smarter and the longer, because
he would not own the Usurpation so much as to Petition it for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
being unwilling to own any power they had to Imprison him,
by any address to them to Release him.</p>
            <p>And when in a throng of other Prisoners he had his Liberty, he
chose to be an exile beyond Sea at <hi>Paris,</hi> rather than submit to the
tumult at home at <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>Cambridge.</hi> If he was too severe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Presbyteries of the Reformed Churches, which they set
up out of necessity, it was out of just indignation against the
Presbytery of <hi>England,</hi> which set up it self out of Schism. And
when he thought it unlawful for a Gentleman of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> to marry a French Presbyterian, it was because he was
transported by the oppression and out-rage of the English. But
being many years beyond Sea, he neither joyned with the Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:59370:241"/>
nor kept any Communion with the Papists: but confined
himself to a Congregation of old English and Primitive Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants:
where by his regular Life and good Doctrine, he reduced
some Recusants <hi>to,</hi> and confirmed more doubters <hi>in</hi> the Protestant
Religion, so defeating the jealousies of his foes, and exceeding
the expectation of his friends. Returning with his Majesty 1660.
he was restored to his own Preferments, and (after Dr. <hi>Loves</hi>
death, the natural Wit, and Orator, Master of <hi>Bennet Colledge,
Margaret Professor</hi> after Dr. <hi>Holdsworth;</hi> in which place he was sure
to affront any man that put up Questions against the Doctrine or
Discipline of the Church of <hi>Engl.</hi> in the worst of times, and Dean
of <hi>Ely)</hi> made Dean of <hi>Ely;</hi> in which dignity he dyed 1662/3 having
this Memorial, That he had bred up his Colledge so well in the
Principles, of Religion and Loyalty, that no one there from the
highest to the lowest, submitted to the Usurpers; for there, was a
through Reformation, neither Master, Fellow, not Scholar being
left of the Foundation; so that according to the Laws of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty
it might seem a Wreck, and forfeited in this Land-tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
for lack of a living thing therein, to preserve the propriety
thereof: a severity contrary to the eternal moral of the Jewish
Law provided against the Depopulation of Birds-nests, that the
old and young ones should be destroyed together. The Doctors

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
THE LORD WILLMOT,
Earl of Rochester.</head>
            <p>THe Lord, <hi>Wilmot,</hi> born on <hi>All-Souls</hi> day in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and bred Fellow of <hi>All-Souls</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> received
a Barony from his Ancestors, and conveyed an
Earldom to his Posterity; of whom a great man
said, That he was, so <hi>Great</hi> a <hi>Scholar,</hi> that he could
give the best advice; and so good a Souldier,
that he could follow it the best of any man in
<hi>England;</hi> none more valiant to return a private affront with the
hazard of his own Person<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (he gave a box on the ear to one of the
most eminent men in this Nation) none more patient in taking a
disgrace, the revenge of which might hazard the publick safety.
(He suffered his Horse to be taken by the bridle, and himself to
be led out of Command by a Messenger from his Majesty in the
Hoad of 700. Horse, over whom he was Lieutenant-General, in
view of the Enemy, to the great dissatisfaction of the Army, which
was ready to Mutiny for the Lord <hi>Willmot,</hi> at that very time when
they should fight the Earl of <hi>Essex.)</hi> He was Captain of Horse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years in the Low Countries, with great respect for his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Courage and good Discipline; and coming thence over, was
made Commissary General of Horse in the Expedition into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
In <hi>Holland</hi> began that animosity between him and <hi>Goring,</hi>
which continued in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His sobriety indeared him to every Army he came to, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rendred him suspected and envied in most actions he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
An excellent Commander of Horse, and of himself, being
therefore mistrusted, because he would not swear, as if Dam-me
had been the Oath of <hi>Allegiance. 1640. Aug. 28.</hi> When the Lord
<hi>Conway</hi> let the <hi>Scots</hi> over <hi>

made head against them, standing with a few prime Gentleman,
when the rest of the Army fled and threw down their Arms to the
Enemies <hi>Horse</hi> and <hi>Cannon;</hi> so effectual, that though being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
he could not defeat them, yet he stunned them so, that
instead of advancing with an Army, next day they submit with a
Petition exactly as Mr. <hi>Willmot</hi> guessed, whose opinion was, <hi>That
one resolute action against the</hi> Scots <hi>should min them who are lost by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> by severities.</hi> He acted like a Statesman when Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:59370:242"/>
in the Expedition against the Scots, telling my Lord <hi>Conway,
That he saw his Majesty would be overcome by the English at home
if he overcame not the</hi> Scots <hi>abroad;</hi> and he spoke like a Souldier
in the Parliament 1641. where whispering with the Lord <hi>Peirey,</hi>
and Colonel <hi>Ashburnham,</hi> as they sate together upon the Vote of
300000<hi>l.</hi> to be paid the <hi>Scots,</hi> with 25000<hi>l.</hi> advance, out of the
money designed the <hi>English</hi> Army; he stepped up and told Mr.
Speaker, <hi>That if such Papers of the</hi> Scots <hi>could procure moneys, he
doubted not, but the Officers of the</hi> English <hi>should soon do the like.</hi> A
wise and brave Speech, that when the Army were informed by him
how the Parliament slighted them, they were ready to Rally them
selves against the Parliament as soon, that Rallied the multitude
against the King; he and some others putting themselves into a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and sworn Juncto, <hi>to declare with the Army, against the rude at
fronts offered his Majesty, to the subversion of Government; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the gracious Concessions made by his Majesty for the support of
it;</hi> but without success, <hi>Because,</hi> as his Lordship used to say, <hi>Treach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

got easily into the</hi> Bosome <hi>of that Prince, that had nothing but</hi> Honesty
<hi>in his heart.</hi> And because some were admitted into their Counsels
against Mr. <hi>Wilmots</hi> advice, who never engaged in a secret design, to

            <p>He obstructed the Faction much in the House of Commons, and
more when called to the House of Lords, stopping their Careere
with those Propositions for Accommodation, which he offered at
<hi>Westminster,</hi> 1641. and to shew he was the same man, guided not
by Interest but Conscience, renewed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> 1644. and making

others did to promote it.</p>
            <p>But when (being Posted for a <hi>Straffordian)</hi> he had no longer any

he had seen so many injuries and indignities offered his Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
so many affronts and scorns put upon the Kingly Office, so
many scandalous, seditious, and traiterous Pamphlets against the
Government, together with the Combinations and Conspiracies,
which the implacable malice, and insatiable ambition of some
persons had contrived) he went to suppress the Rebellion in the
Field; (being Voted a Traytor by those he indeavoured should not
be so.) At <hi>Edge-hill</hi> he advised, that there should be a good Reserve
of Horse to secure the Battel, and that the other Horse should by

Life and Death

Sir BEVILE GREENVILE,
Father of the Right Honorable, the Earl of Bathe.</head>
            <p>THere are two ancient Families in this Gentlemans
name, the <hi>Beviles,</hi> that have flourished six hundred
years in <hi>Cornwall</hi> at <hi>Gwarnack.</hi> in his Christian Name;
and the <hi>Greenviles</hi> that have continued in great honor
at <hi>Bediford</hi> in <hi>Devonshire</hi> above five hundred years in
his Surname: And there were the two eminent Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of those Families, in his nature (his names being to him not
only significations of Honor, but intimations of Virtue, according
to that admonition given by <hi>Alexander</hi> to one of his Followers,

<hi>R. Greenvile</hi> assisted King <hi>William Rufus</hi> 1113. against the <hi>Welch</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells,
successfully dedicating the Spoils of the war to the honor of
Almighty God, in maintaining a Religious House. Sir <hi>Bevile

of <hi>Triers;</hi> being for his publick spirit and activity, especially in
improving the Trade, maintaining the Priviledges, and keeping
up the Discipline of his Country, called to advise with his Majesty
in Parliament, about the great affairs of the kingdom, he would
not continue there without him: But when he saw that he was
more likely to be suppressed by his Majesties adversaries, than his
Majesty was to be supported by his friendship at <hi>Westminster,</hi> he
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:59370:244"/>
withdrew, with many more <hi>Devonshire</hi> and <hi>Cornish</hi> Gentlemen that

of that Country, Kersies, Bonelace, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> and setled as good a

Greenviles</hi> advice, as was before by Sir <hi>Theo. Greenvile's</hi> device, who
built <hi>Baddiford-bridge,</hi> as Sir <hi>Bevile</hi> secured it. They appear in a
great body near <hi>Pendennis,</hi> whereof Sir <hi>Nicholas Slaning,</hi> another
excellent Patriot of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> was Governor, and <hi>Launston</hi> the
County-town of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> which Sir <hi>Bevile Greenvile</hi> possessed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of.</p>
            <p>The Body he trained to war, he disciplined to piety (piety not
like the <hi>Cornish</hi> Diamond, counterfeit) and strictness, least as <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards</hi>
in this Country, being persecuted by their fellow-fish, the
<hi>Tunny</hi> and <hi>Hake,</hi> fall into the Fisher-mens Nets; so the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people
abused by the incivilities of their friends, the Cavaleers,
might be taken in the Snares of their enemies the Faction. As the
Ambergreese, found sometimes in this Country, hath a more fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
scent, compounded with other things, than when singly its
self; so this noble Gentleman gained a greater repute, when joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
counsels and endeavors with others, than when he acted alone.
The neighbor Counties were on fire, these Counties look to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Sir <hi>Bevile</hi> wished that his Army were all of them as good
as his Cause, but it is not to be expected that all should be Fish that
are caught in a Drag-net; neither that all should be good and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
people, who were adventurers in an action of so large a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
as this war was; some of the Devils Black Guard may be
listed among Gods Souldiers, yet there were fewer oaths among
them, than in any Army then in <hi>England.</hi> 
               <hi rend="margQuotes">They say the Cornish-tongue
affordeth but two natural oaths, or but three at the most.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The sobriety of this Army (which Sir <hi>Bevile</hi> would say <hi>were
greater, if less,</hi> some being rather a burden than strength to it) made
them valiant (its the foul Gun and the guilty Conscience that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coils)
as when Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> intended to break the Western
Association at <hi>Landsdown,</hi> was beaten out of his Lines and Hedges
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:59370:245"/>

hill, fortified on all sides, the passage up very narrow and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
between a Wood, lined with Musqueteers on the one hand,
and Hedges on the other, gained after four desperate Repulses by
Horse, Foot, and Canon, by Sir <hi>Bevill,</hi> and maintained with a Stand
of his own Pikes, with a gallantry and honor admired by his very
enemies, until he was unfortunately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

both which a vertuous suffering, pityed by mankind advancing,
as well as heroick attempts commended by them; the first in the
eyes of all men, deserving that success which the last wanted: to
which circumspect converse he added frequent conferences to
his Masters in the good opinion of those near him; and an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted

that his Majesty should return 1660. to <hi>London</hi> with as
great triumph in peace, as his blessed Father was 1641. driven out
of it by tumults.</p>
            <p>Neither did Sir <hi>Richard</hi> come over alone to the Kings service;

more Resolved, Loyal, and Active; the people loved him so well,
that they chose him one of their Representatives; and the King
esteemed him so much, that he sent for him as one of his Peers in
Parliament, wherein the King and People agreed in no one thing,
save a just kindness to my Lord <hi>Capel;</hi> who was one of those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent

Life; a piety, that (as it appeared by his dismission of his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
and the formalities of that times Devotion, before he came to
the Scaffold) was rather his inward frame and habit, than outward
ostentation or pomp; from the noble Sentiments whereof (as

frailty; yet even then he did not forget both to Comfort and
Counsel her, and the rest of his friends, particularly in blessing
the young Lord, whom he commanded not to revenge his death,

OF

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bishop of Armagh, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HE was bred in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in <hi>Sydney Colledge</hi> under
Mr. <hi>Hulet,</hi> a grave and a worthy man, and he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself not only a fruitful Plant by his great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
in his Studies, but made him another return of
gratitude, taking care to provide him a good Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he then began to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
interested. It was spoken as an honor to <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> that he
gave his Tutor an honorable Funeral; and <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Statue unto his; and <hi>Gratian</hi> the Emperor made his Master
<hi>Ausonius</hi> to be Consul: And our worthy Primate, knowing the
obligation which they pass upon us, who do <hi>Obstetricari gravidae
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:59370:255"/>
animae,</hi> help the parturient Soul to bring forth fruit according to
its seminal powers, was careful, not only to reward the industry
of such persons so useful to the Church in the cultivating <hi>infantes
plamarum,</hi> young Plants, whose joynts are to be stretched and made
streight, but to demonstrate that his Scholar knew how to value
his Learning, when he knew so well how to reward the Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.</p>
            <p>Having passed the course of his studies in the University, and
done his Exercise with that Applause, which is usually the reward
of pregnant Wits and hard, he was removed into <hi>York-shire;</hi>
where first in the City of <hi>York</hi> he was an assiduous Preacher, but
by the disposition of the Divine Providence, he happened to be
engaged at <hi>North-Alerton</hi> in Disputation with three pragmatical
Romish Priests of the Jesuits Order, whom he so much worsted in
the Conference, and so shamefully disadvantaged by the evidence
of the Truth, represented wisely and learnedly, that the famous
Primate of <hi>York</hi> Arch-bishop <hi>Matthews,</hi> a learned and an excellent
Prelate, and most worthy Preacher, hearing of that Triumph, sent
for him, and made him his Chaplain; in whose service he continued
until the death of the Primate, but in that time had given so much
Testimony of his great Dexterity in the Conduct of Ecclesiastical
and Civil Affairs, that he grew dear to his Master. In that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
he was made Prebendary of <hi>York,</hi> and then of <hi>Rippon;</hi>
the Dean of which Church, having made him his Sub-Dean, he
managed the Affairs of the Church so well, that he soon acquired
a greater same, and entred into the possession of many hearts, and
admiration to those many more that knew him. There, and at his
Parsonage he continued long to do the duty of a learned and good
Preacher, and by his Wisdom, Eloquence, and Deportment, so
gained the affections of the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons of
that Country, that as at his return thither upon the Restauration
of his most sacred Majesty, he knew himself obliged enough, and
was so kinde as to give them a visit, so they by their coming in
great numbers to meet him, their joyful Reception of him, their
great caressing of him while he was there, their forward hopes to
enjoy him as their Bishop, their trouble at his departure, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness
to let him go away, give signal Testimonies that they
were wise and kinde enough to understand and value his great
worth. But while he lived there, he was like a Diamond in the
dust, <hi>(or Lucius Quintius at the plough)</hi> his low fortune covered a
most valuable person, till he came to be discovered by Sir <hi>Thomas
Wentworth</hi> Lord President of <hi>York,</hi> whom we all knew for his great
Excellencies, and his great, but glorious Misfortunes. This rare
person espyed the great abilities of Dr. <hi>Bramhall,</hi> and made him
his Chaplain, and brought him into <hi>Ireland,</hi> as one whom he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
would prove the most fit Instrument to serve in that design,
which for two years before his Arrival here, he had greatly medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
and resolved the Reformation of Religion, and the Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the broken fortunes of the Church. The Complaints
were many, the Abuses great, the Causes of the Church vastly nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:59370:255"/>
but as fast as they were brought in, so fast were they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
back by the Lord Deputy to Dr. <hi>Bramhall,</hi> who by his inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable
pains, great sagacity, perpetual watchfulness, daily and
hourly Consultations, reduced things to a more tollerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than they had been left in by Schismatical principles of some
and unjust Prepossessions of others for many years before. For
at the Reformation, the Popish Bishops and Priests seemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and did so, that keeping their Bishopricks they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
their kindred, and dilapidate the Revenues of the Church;
which, by pretended-Offices, false Informations, Fee-farms at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Rents, and ungodly Alienations, were made low as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
it self, and unfit to minister to the needs of them that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Altar, or the noblest purposes of Religion; for Hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
decayed, and the Bishops were easily to be oppressed by those
that would, and they complained, but for a long time had no
helper, till God raised that glorious Instrument the Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
who brought over with him as great Affections to the
Church, and to all publick Interests, and as admirable abilities as
ever before his time did invest and adorn any of the Kings Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents:
and God fitted his hand with an Instrument good, as
his skill was great. For the first specimen of his Abilities and
Diligence in the recovery of some lost Tythes, being represented
to his late Majesty of blessed and glorious Memory, it pleased his
Majesty upon the death of Bishop <hi>Downham,</hi> to advance the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
the Bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>oprick of <hi>Derry,</hi> which he not only adorned with an
excellent spirit, and a wise Government, but did more than dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Revenue, not by taking away any thing from them to
whom it was due, but by resuming something of the Churches Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
which by undue means was detained in unsitting hands;
But his care was beyond his Diocésse, and his zeal broke out to
warm all his Brethren; and though by reason of the favor and
Piety of King <hi>Iames,</hi> the escheated Counties were well provided
for their Tythes, yet the Bishop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>icks were not so well, till the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mato,
then Bishop of <hi>Derry,</hi> by the favor of the Lord Lieutenant, and
his own incessant and assiduous labor and wise Conduct, brought
in divers Impropriations, cancelled many unjust Alienations, and
did restore them to a condition much more tollerable; for he
raised them above contempt, yet they were not near to envy;
but he knew there could not in all times be wanting too many
that envied to the Church every degree of Prosperity: So <hi>Iudas</hi>
did to Christ, the expence of Oyntment; and so <hi>Dionisius</hi> told the
Priest when himself stole the Golden Cloak from <hi>Apollo,</hi> and gave
him one of <hi>Arcadian</hi> home-spun, that it was warmer for him in
Winter, and colder in Summer. And so ever since the Church by
Gods blessing, and the favor of Religious Kings and Princes, and
pious Nobility, hath been endowed with fair Revenues; <hi>inimicus
homo,</hi> the enemy hath not been wanting by pretences of Religion,
to take away Gods portion from the Church, as if his word were
intended as an Instrument to rob his Houses.</p>
            <p>But when the <hi>Israelites</hi> were governed by a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and God was
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:59370:256"/>
their King, and <hi>Moses</hi> his Lieutenant, and things were of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement,
he was pleased, by making great provisions for them
that ministred in the service of the Tabernacle, to consign this
truth for ever; That Men as they love God, at the same rate are
to make provisions for his Priests. But this to no other end, than
to represent upon what Religious grounds the then Bishop of <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
did, with so much care and assiduous labour endeavor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> to that splendor and fulness, which
did much conduce to the honor of God and of Religion. This
wise Prelate rarely well understood it, and having the same advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and blessing as we have now, a Gracious King and a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
Patron of Religion and the Church, he improved the <hi>

Religion of the ancient Princes and Nobles of this Kingdom had
bountifully given, to such a comfortable competency, that though
there be place for present and future piety to inlarge it, yet no
man hath reason to be discouraged in his duty; insomuch, that as
I have heard from a most worthy hand, that at his going into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he gave account to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> of 30000 <hi>l.</hi>
a year, in the recovery of which, he was greatly and principally
instrumental. But the Goods of this World are called <hi>Waters</hi> by
<hi>Solomon;</hi> stollen waters are sweet, and they are too unstable to be
stopp'd: Some of these Waters did run back from their Channel,
and return to another Course than God and the Laws intended,
yet his labours and pious Counsels were not the less acceptable to
God and to good Men; and therefore by a thankful and honorable
recognition, the Convocation of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in Record to Posterity, their deep resentment of his singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
services, and great abilities in this whole affair. And this honor
will for ever remain to that Bishop of <hi>Derry;</hi> he had a <hi>Zer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who repaired the Temple, and restored its beauty; but he was the
<hi>Ioshuah,</hi> the High-priest, who under him ministred this blessing to
the Congregations of the Lord. But his care was not determined in
the exterior part only and accessaries of Religion, he was careful, he
was prosperous in the interior, to reduce that Divine and Excellent
Service of our Church to publick and constant Exercise, to Unity
and Devotion, and to cause the Articles of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to be accepted, as the rule of publick Confessions and Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
here, that they might be <hi>populus unius labii,</hi> of one Heart and
of one Lip, building up our hopes of heaven upon a most holy
Faith; and taking away that <hi>Shibboleth</hi> which made this Church
lisp too undecently, or rather, in some little degree, to speak the
Speech of <hi>Ashdod,</hi> and not the Language of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and wise pains he took in this particular, no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
or reproach, but he that is not willing to confess that
the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the best Reformed Church in the World.
God by the prosperity of his labours, and a blessed effect, gave te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
not only of the piety and wisdom of his purposes, but that
he loves to bless a wise instrument, when it is vigorously exerted in
a wise and religious labour. He overcame the difficulty, in defiance
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:59370:256"/>
of all such pretences as were made even from Religion it self, to
obstruct the better procedure of real and material Religion.
These were great things, and matter of great envy, and like the
Fiery Eruptions of <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> might with the very Ashes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
have buried another man. At first indeed, as his blessed
Master, most Holy Jesus had, so he also had his <hi>annum acceptabilem.</hi>
At first the product was nothing but great admiration at his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
parts, and wonder at his mighty diligence, and observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his unusual zeal in so good and great things: But this
quickly passed into the natural Daughters of Envy, Suspition, and
Detraction, the spirit of Obloquy and Slander. His zeal for reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of the Church Revenues, was called Oppression and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,
Covetousness and Injustice; his care of reducing Religion
to wise and justifiable Principles, was called Popery and Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism,
and I know not what names; which signifie what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
are pleased to mean, and the People to construe and to hate.
The intermedial prosperity of his person and fortune, which he
had as an earnest of a greater reward to so well meant labours,
was supposed to be the production of illiberal arts and ways of
getting; and the necessary refreshment of his wearied spirits,
which did not always supply all his needs, and were sometimes
less than the permissions even of prudent charity, they called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance:

            <p>Our B.S. knowing the unsatisfiable angers of Men, if their
Money or Estates were medled with, refused to divide an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
amongst Brethren: It was not to be imagined, that this
great person (invested, as all his Brethren were, with the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Mortality, and yet imployed in dividing, and recovering,
and apportioning of Lands) should be able to bear all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

And so did he, the affrightments brought to his great fame andre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
made him to walk more warily, and do justly, and walk
prudently, and conduct his affairs by the measures of the Laws as
far as he understood, and indeed that was a very great way: But
there was <hi>aperta Iustitia, clausa Manut,</hi> Justice was open, but his
Hand was shut, and though every Slanderer could tell a Story, yet
none could prove that ever he received a Bribe to blind his Eyes,
to the value of a Pair of Gloves. It was his own expression, when
he gave Glory to God who had preserved him Innocent. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
every mans Cause is right in his own Eyes, it was hard for
him so to acquit himself, that in the Intrigues of Law, and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:59370:257"/>
Cases, some of his enemies should not seem (when they were
heard alone) to speak reason against. But see the greatness of
Faith and Prudence, and how greatly God stood with him, when
the numerous Armies of vexed people, <hi>Turba gravis paci placidae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
inimica quieti,</hi> heaped up Catalogues of Accusations, when the
Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> imitating the violent Procedures of the then
disordered <hi>English;</hi> when this glorious Patron was taken from his
Head, and he was disrobed of his great defences; when the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were invited, and Accusations furnished, and Calumny was
rewarded and managed with Art and Power, when there was
above two hundred Petitions put in against him, and himself denied
leave to answer by Word of Mouth; when he was long Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
and Treated, so that a guilty man would have broken into
affrightment, and pittiful, and low considerations; yet then he
standing almost alone, like <hi>Callimachus</hi> at <hi>Marathon,</hi> invested with
Enemies, and covered with Arrows, defended himself beyond all
the powers of Guiltiness, even with the defences of Truth, and
the bravery of Innocence, and answered the Petitions in Writing
sometimes twenty in a day, with so much Clearness, Evidence of
Truth, Reallity of Fact, and Testimony of Law, that his very
Enemies were ashamed and convinced; they found that they had
done like <hi>Aesops</hi> Viper, they licked the File till their Tongues bled,
but himself was wholly invulnerable. They were therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to leave their Muster-rolls, and decline their Particulars, and
fall to their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to accuse him for going about to subvert the
Fundamental Laws; the way by which great <hi>Strafford</hi> and <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
fell; which was a device, when all reasons failed, to oppress
the Enemy by the bold Affirmation of a Conclusion they could
not prove; they did like those <hi>Gladiatores,</hi> whom the <hi>Romans</hi> called
<hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iaries,</hi> when they could not Stab their Enemies with their Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
they threw Nets over him, and covered him with a general
mischief. But the Martyr King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, of most Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Eternal Memory, seeing so great a Champion likely to
be oppressed with numbers and despair, sent what rescue he could,
his Royal Letter for his Bayl, which was hardly granted to him;
and when it was, it was upon such hard terms, that his very delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was a persecution. So necessary it was for them, who intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to do mischief to the publick, to take away the strongest Pillars
of the House. This thing I remark, to acquit this great man from
the tongue of slander which had so boldly spoken, that it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
some thing would stick, yet was impotent and unarmed, that
it could not kill that great same which his greater worthiness had
procured him. It was said of <hi>Hipp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Every thing can have an ill name and an ill sense put upon it;

the order of his providence confutes the slander, <hi>ut memoria ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storum
sit in benedictionibus,</hi> that the Memory of the Righteous
might be embalmed with honor: And so it hapned to this great
man, for by a publick warranty, by the concurrent consent of
both Houses of Parliament, the libellous Petitions against him,
the false Records and publick Monuments of injurious shame were
cancell'd, and he was restored <hi>in integrum,</hi> to that fame where his
great labors and just procedures had first Estated him; which
though it was but justice, yet it was also such honor, that it is
greater than the virulence of tongues, his worthiness and their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
had arm'd against him. But yet the great Scene of troubles was
but newly open'd, I shall not refuse to speak yet more of his
troubles, as remembring that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he discourses of the
glory of the Saints departed, he tells more of their Sufferings,
than of their Prosperities, as being that Laboratory and Crysable
in which God makes his Servants Vessels of honor to his glory.
The storm quickly grew high, &amp; <hi>transitum a linguis ad gladios,</hi>
and that was indeed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Iniquity had put on Arms,
when it is <hi>armata nequitia,</hi> then a man is hard put to it. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
breaking out, the Bishop went to his Charge at <hi>Derry,</hi> and
because he was within the defence of the Walls, the execrable
Traytor Sir <hi>Phelim O Neal,</hi> laid a snare to bring him to a dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
death; for he wrote a Letter to the Bishop, pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
between them, desired that according to their former
agreement, such a Gate might be delivered to him. The Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was not advis'd to be Cautious, not at all instructed in the Art
of Secrecy, for it was intended, that he should be search'd, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and hanged for ought they car'd: but the Arrow was shot
against the Bishop, that he might be accused for base conspiracy,
and dye with shame and sad dishonor. But here God manifested
his mighty care of his Servants, he was pleased to send into the
heart of the Messenger such affrightment, that he directly ran
away with the Letter, and never came near the Town to deliver
it. This story was published by Sir <hi>Phelim</hi> himself, who added,
that if he could have thus ensnared the Bishop, he had good assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
the Town should have been his own: <hi>Sed bonitas Dei praeva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litura
est super omnem v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alitionem hominis.</hi> The goodness of God is
greater than all the malice of men, and nothing so could prove
how dear that Sacred Life was to God, as his rescue from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.
<hi>Stantia non poterant tecta probare Deos:</hi> To have kept him in
a warm house had been nothing, unless the Roof had fallen upon
his Head; that rescue was a remark of Divine Favour and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
But it seems Sir <hi>Phelim</hi>'s Treason against this worthy man
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:59370:258"/>
had a correspondent in Town, and it broke out speedily; for what
they could not effect by a malicious stratagem, they did in part by
open force; they turned the Bishop out of Town, and upon trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and unjust pretences, search'd his Carriages, and took what
they pleased, till they were ashamed to take more: They did
worse than Divorce him from his Church, for in all the <hi>Roman</hi>
Divorces, they said, <hi>Tuas tibi res habeto,</hi> Take your Goods and be
gone; but Plunder was Religion then. However, though the
usage was sad, yet it was recompenced to him, by taking Sanctuary
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was graciously received by that most incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and divine Prince; but having served the King in <hi>York-shire</hi>
by his Pen, and by his Counsels, and by his Interests, returned back
to <hi>Ireland;</hi> where under the excellent Conduct of his Grace the
now Lord Lieutenant, he ran the risque and fortune of oppressed
vertue. But God having still resolved to afflict us, the good man
was forced into the fortune of the Patriarchs to leave his Country
and his Charges, and seek for safety and bread in a strange Land,
for so the Prophets were used to do, wandring up and down in
Sheeps Cloathing, but poor as they were, the world was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of them; and this worthy Man, despising the shame, took up
his Crosse, and followed his Master.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Exilium causa ipsa jubet sibi dulce videri,</l>
               <l>Et de siderium dulce levat patriae.</l>
            </q>
            <p>He was not ashamed to suffer where the Cause was honorable
and glorious; but so God provided for the needs of his banished,
and sent a man who could minister comfort to the afflicted, and
courage to the persecuted, and resolutions to the tempted, and
strength to that Religion for which they all suffered. And here
indeed this great Man was Triumphant, this was one of the last
and best Scenes of his life: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> The Last
Days are the best Witnesses of Man. But so it was, that he stood
in publick and brave defence for the Doctrine and Discipline of
the Church of <hi>England:</hi> First, by his sufferings and great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
for <hi>verbis tantum Philosophari, non est Doctoris sed Histrionis.</hi> To
talk well and not to do bravely, is for a Comaedian, not a Divine.
But this great man did both; he suffered his own Calamity with
great Courage, and by his Wise Discourses strengthened the hearts
of others. For there wanted not diligent Tempters in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> who (taking advantage of the afflictions of his Sacred
Majesty, in which state men commonly suspect every thing, and
like men in Sickness are willing to change from Side to Side, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
for ease and finding none) flew at the Royal Game, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to draw away the King from that Religion, which his most
Royal Father, the best Man, and wisest Prince in the World, had
Seal'd with the best Bloud in Christendom; and which Himself
Suck'd in with his Education, and had Confirmed by Choice and
Reason, and Confessed Publickly and Bravely, and hath since Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
Prosperously. <hi>Millitiere</hi> was the man, witty and bold
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:59370:258"/>
enough, to attempt a zealous and a foolish Undertaking; and
addressed himself with Ignoble, indeed but Witty Arts, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the King to leave what was dearer to him than his Eyes. It
is true, it was a Wave dashed against the Rock, and an Arrow shot
against the Sun; it could not reach him, but the Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi>
turned it also, and made it fall upon the Shooters head; for he
made so Ingenious, so Learned, and so Acute Reply to that Book;
he so discovered the Errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, retorted the
Arguments, stated the Questions, demonstrated the Truth, and
shamed their Procedures, that nothing could be a greater Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Bishops Learning, great Parts, deep Judgment, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Apprehension, and sincerity in the Catholick and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Faith, or of the Follies and prevarications of the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi> He wrote no Apologies for himself, though it were much
to be wished, that as <hi>Iunius</hi> wrote his own Life, or <hi>Moses</hi> his own
Story, so we might have understood from himself, how great
things God had done for him and by him; but all that, he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to God, and was silent in his own defences. <hi>Gloriosus enim est
injuriam tacendo fugere, quam respondendo superare.</hi> ut when the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and Conscience of his King, and the Interest of True Religion
was at Stake, the Fire burned within him; and at last he spake
with his Tongue, he cryed out like the Son of <hi>Craesus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>Take heed, and meddle not with the King; his Person is too
sacred, and Religion too dear to him, to be assaulted by vulgar h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ds.</hi> In
short, he acquitted himself in this affair with so much Truth and
Piety, Learning and Judgment, that in these Papers, his memory
will last unto very late succeeding Generations. But this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Prelate found a Nobler Adversary, and a Braver Scene for his
Contention; he found that the <hi>Roman</hi> Priests, being wearied and
baffled by the wise Discourses, and pungent Arguments of the
<hi>English</hi> Divines, had studiously declined to Dispute any more the
particular Questions against us, but fell at last upon a General
Charge, imputing to the Church of <hi>England</hi> the great Crime of
Schism; and by this they thought they might with most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
deceive unwary and unskillful Readers; for they saw the
Schism, and they saw that we had left them, and because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
not the Causes, they resolved to out-face us in the Charge.
But now it was that <hi>dignum nactus Argumentum,</hi> having an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
fit to imploy his great abilities,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Consecrat hic praeful calamum calamique labores,</l>
               <l>Ante aras Domino laeta trophaea suo.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Bishop now dedicates his labours to the service of God, and
and of his Church, undertook the Question, and in a full Discourse
proves the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only to be guilty of the Schism,
by making it necessary to depart from them, but they did actuate
the Schisms, and themselves made the first separation in the great
point of the Popes Supremacy, which was the <hi>Palladium,</hi> for which
they principally contended. He made it appear, that the Popes
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:59370:259"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> were Usurpers of the Rights of Kings and Bishops, that
they brought in new Doctrines in every Age, that they imposed
their own devices upon all Christendom as Articles of Faith,
that they prevaricated the Doctrine of the Apostles, that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> returned to her Primitive Purity, that She
joyned with Christ and his Apostles, that She agreed in all the
sentiments of the Primitive Church. He stated the Questions so
Wisely, and conducted them so Prudently, and handled them so
Learnedly, that I may truly say, they were never more materially
confuted by any man since the Questions so unhappily have disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christendom. <hi>Verum hoc eos male ussit:</hi> And they finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
smitten under the fifth Rib, set up an old Champion of their
own, a <hi>Goliah</hi> to fight against the Armies of <hi>Israel:</hi> The old bishop
of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> known to many of us, replied to this excellent
Book, but was so answered by a Rejoynder made by the Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Derry,</hi> in which he so pressed the former Arguments, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Cavils, brought in so many impregnable Authorities and
Probations, and added so many moments and weights to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
the pleasure of the Reading of the Book would be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
if the profit to the Church of God were not greater.</p>

though there start up another Combatant against him, yet he had
only the honor to fall by the hands of <hi>Hector.</hi> Still <hi>haeret lateri le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalis
arundo;</hi> the Headed Arrow went in so far, that it could not
be drawen out, but the Barbed Steel stuck behind. And when
ever men will desire to be satisfied in those great Questions, the
Bishop of <hi>Derry</hi>'s Book shall be his Oracle. I will not insist upon
his excellent Writings, but it is known every where with what
Piety and <hi>Acumen</hi> he wrote against the <hi>Manichean</hi> Doctrine of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Necessity, which a late witty Man had pretended to adorn with
a new Vizor; but this excellent person washed off the Cerusse,
and the Meretricious Paintings, rarely well asserted the Aeconomy
of the Divine Providence, and having once more triumphed over
his Adversary, <hi>Plenus victoriarum &amp; trophaeorum,</hi> betook himself to
the more agreeable attendance upon the Sacred Offices, and usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
and wisely discoursed of the Sacred Rite of Confirmation,
Imposed Hands upon the most Illustrious, the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and
<hi>Slocester,</hi> and the Princess Royal, and Ministred to them the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of the Holy Spirit, Ministerially established them in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Service of the Holy Jesus. And one thing more I shall
remark, that at his leaving those parts, upon the Kings Return,
some of the Remonstrant Ministers of the Low-Countries coming
to take their leave of this great Man, and desiring that by his
means the Church of <hi>England</hi> would be kind to them, he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:59370:259"/>
to grant it, because they were learned men, and in many
things of a most excellent belief; yet he reproved them and gave
them Caution against it, that they approached too near and gave
too much countenance to the great and dangerous errors of the
<hi>Socinians.</hi> He thus having served God and the King abroad, God
was pleased to return to the King, and to us all, as in the days of
old, we sung the song of <hi>David, In convertendo captivitatem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and the crushed Obelisks, and the old face of beauteous <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laenium,</hi>
could not but admire the disordered glories of such mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Structures, which were venerable in their very dust.
He ever was used to overcome all difficulties, only mortality was
too hard for him; but still his Vertues and his Spirit was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal;
he took great care, and still had new and noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
and propsed to himself admirable things. He governed his
Province with great justice and sincerity;
<q>
                  <l>Vnus amplo consulens pastor gregi,</l>
                  <l>Somnos tuetur omnium solus, <hi>Vigil.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And had this Remark in all his Government, that as he was a great
hater of Sacriledge, so he professed himself a publick enemy to
non-residence, and would declare wisely and religiously against
it, allowing it no case, but of necessity, or the greater good of the
Church. There are great things spoken of his Predecessor St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,</hi>
that he founded 700. Churches and Religious Convents,
that he ordained 5000. Priests, and with his own hands Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
350. Bishops. How true this story is, I know not; but we
are all witnesses that the late Primate did by an extraordinary
contingency of Providence, in one day Consecrate two Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and ten Bishops, and benefit to almost all the Churches in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and was greatly instrumental to the Re-endowments of
the whole Clergy; and in the greatest abilities and incomparable
industry, was inferior to none of his most glorious Antecessors.
Since the Canonization of Saints came into the Church, we finde
no Irish Bishop Canonized, except St. <hi>Laurence</hi> of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and St.
<hi>Milachias</hi> of <hi>Down;</hi> indeed <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Armagh</hi>'s Canonization was

was learned in the Scriptures, skilled in secular Philosophy, and
not unknowing in the Civil and Canon Laws; he was of an
excellent Spirit, a Scholar in his discourses, an early and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Preacher to the people. And, as if there were a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
sympathy between their souls, our Primate had so great a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
to his Memory, that he purposed, if he had lived, to have
restored his Monument in <hi>Dundalke,</hi> which Time, or Impiety, or
Unthankfulness, had either omitted or destroyed. So great a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he was of all true inherent worth, that he loved it in the very
memory of the dead, and to have such great examples to intuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and imitation of Posterity. At his coming to the Primacy, he
knew he should at first espy little, besides the Ruines of Discipline,
a Harvest of Thorns and Heresies, prevailing in the hearts of the
people, the Churches possessed by Wolves and Intruders, mens
hearts greatly estranged from true Religion; and therefore he set
himself to weed the Field of the Church, he treated the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
sometimes sweetly, sometimes he confuted them learnedly,
sometimes he rebuked them sharply. He visited his Charges di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
and in his own person, not by Proxies and instrumental
Deputations: <hi>Quaerens non nostra, sed nos &amp; quae sunt Iesu Christi;</hi>
He designed nothing that we knew of, but the Redintegration of
Religion, the Honor of God, the King, the restoring of collapsed
Discipline, and the Renovation of Faith, and the service of God
in the Churches. And still he was indefatigable, and, even as the
last Scene of his life, intended to take a Regal Visitation. <hi>Quid
enim vultis me otiosum a Domino comprehendi?</hi> said one; he was not
willing that God should take him unimployed: But good man, he
felt his Tabernacle ready to fall in pieces, and could go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for God would have no more work done by that hand; he
therefore espying this, put his House in order, and had lately vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
his Diocesse, and done what he then could to put his Charge
in order; for he had a good while since received the sentence of
death within himself, and knew he was shortly to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his Stewardship; he therefore upon a brisk Alarm of
death, which God sent him the<note n="a" place="margin">1662.</note> last <hi>Ianuary.</hi> made his Will;
in which, besides the prudence and presence of Spirit, manifested
in making a just and wise settlement of his Estate, and Provisions
for his Descendants, at midnight, and in the trouble of his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and circumstances of addressing death, still kept a special sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,
and made confession of Gods admirable mercies, and gave
thanks that God had permitted him to live to see the blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration
of his Majesty, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> confessed his
faith to be the same as ever, gave praises to God that he was born
and bred up in this Religion, and pray'd God, and hoped he should
die in the Communion of this Church, which he declared to be
the most pure and Apostolical Church in the world. He prayed
to God to pardon his frailties and infirmities, relied upon the
mercies of God, and the Merits of Jesus Christ, and with a singular
sweetness resigned up his soul into the hands of his Redeemer.
But God, who is the great <hi>Choragas</hi> and Master of the Scenes of
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:59370:260"/>
Life and Death, was not pleased then to draw the Curtains; there
was an Epilogue to his life, yet to be acted and spoken. He re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>turned
to actions and life, and went on in methods of the same
procedures as before; was desirous still to establish the Affairs of
the Church, complained of some disorders which he purposed to
redress, girt himself to the work; but though his spirit was wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling,
yet his flesh was weak; and as the Apostles in the Vespers of
Christs Passion, so he in the Eve of his own dissolution, was heavy
not to sleep, but heavy unto death, and looked for the last warn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning,
which seized on him in the middest of his business; and
though it was sudden, yet it could not be unexpected, or unpro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vided
by surprize, and therefore could be no more than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
which <hi>Augustus</hi> used to wish unto himself, a civil and well-natured
death, without the amazement of troublesome circumstances, or
the great cracks of a falling house, or the convulsions of impatience.
<hi>Seneca</hi> tells us, that <hi>Bassus Anfidius</hi> was wont to say, <hi>Sperare se nullum
lorem esse in illo extremo anhelita, si tamen esset, habere aliquantums in
ipsa brevitate solatii.</hi> He hoped that the pain of the vast dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were little or none; or if they were, it was full of comfort,
that they could be short. It happened so to this Excellent Man,
his passive fortune had been abundantly tryed before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there was the less need of it now; his active Graces had been
abundantly demonstrated by the great and good things he did, and
therefore his last Scene was not so laborious; but God called him
away something after the manner of <hi>Moses,</hi> which the <hi>Iews</hi> express
by <hi>Osculum Oris Dei,</hi> The Kiss of Gods Month; that is, as death in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deed
fore-signified but gentle and serene, and without temptation.</p>
            <p>To sum up all, he was a Wise Prelate, a Learned Doctor, a Just
Man, a True Friend, a great Benefactor to others, a thankful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiary
where he was obliged himself: He was a faithful Servant
to his Masters, a Loyal Subject to the King, a zealous Assertor of
his Religion, against Popery on the one side, and Fanaticism on the
other. The practice of his Religion was not so much in Forms
and exterior Ministries, though he was a great observer of all the
publick Rites and Ministries of the Church, as it was doing good
for others. He was like <hi>Myson,</hi> whom the <hi>Scythian Anacharsis</hi> so
greatly praised, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he governed his Family well
he gave to all their due of maintenance, and duely, he did great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to Mankind; he had the fate of the Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he passed
through evil report and good report, as a deceiver and yet true.
He was a man of great business, and great resort: <hi>Semper aliquis
Cydonis domo,</hi> as the <hi>Corinthian</hi> said, there was always some-body in
<hi>Cydons</hi> house. He was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he divided his Life into
labour, and his Book; he took care of Churches when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,
and even after his death, having left five hundred pounds, for
the repair of his Cathedral of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in
<hi>Drogheda.</hi> He was an excellent Scholar, and rarely well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished;
first instructed to great excellency by natural parts, and
then consummated by Study and Experience. <hi>Melancthon</hi> was
used to say, that himself was a Logician, <hi>Pomeranus</hi> a Grammarian,
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:59370:261"/>
               <hi>Iustus Ionas</hi> an Orator, but that <hi>Luther</hi> was all these. It was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true of him, that the single perfections, which make many men
eminent, were united in this Primate, and made him Illustrious.</p>

For in him was visible the great lines of <hi>Hookers</hi> Judiciousness, of
<hi>Iewells</hi> Learning, of the Acuteness of Bishop <hi>Andrews.</hi> He was in
more great things than one; and as one said of <hi>Phidias</hi> he could
not only make excellent Statues of Ivory, but he could work in
Stone and Brass. He shewed his Equanimity in Poverty, and his
Justice in Riches; he was useful in his Country, and profitable in
his Banishment. For as <hi>Paraeus</hi> was at <hi>Anvilla, Luther</hi> at <hi>Wittenburg,</hi>
St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> and St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in their Banishment, St. <hi>Ierome</hi> in

besides the particular endearments which his friends received from
him, he did do Relief to his Brethren that wanted, and supplied

who had the same apprehensions with him about the
Church (a publick body (he would call it) <hi rend="margQuotes">not only to be taught

by Discipline and Government from scandals) came by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate

temper was, that by his goodly presence and great Retinue
he hazarded the envy of people, to avoid contempt: a thing (he
would say) <hi>a man</hi> should <hi>avoid as death,</hi> it being an undervaluing
of a man upon a belief of his utter uselesness and inable; attended

is power, which who despises, weakens; for where there is
contempt, there can be no aw, and where there is no aw, there
will be no subjection; and we have known that the most effectual
method of disobedience, is first to slur a Governors person, and
then to overthrow his power. He knew that though he must
approve himself to wise men by his vertues, he must take the
vulgar that see not beyond the surface, with his carriage; they as

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Dr. SAMUEL MARSH,
Dean of York.</head>
            <p>DOctor <hi>Marsh,</hi> born <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. 1586. at <hi>Finchamsted</hi> in <hi>Herts,</hi>
and bred Fellow of <hi>All-Souls,</hi> took to his book, and
became a Scholar against the will of his friends, and a
Divine against his own, upon the same occasion that
others become Physicians, for being serupulous and
inquisitive; he spent so much time in settling his own soul, that
before he was aware, he was immersed in that noble Science and
Art of saving others; <hi>Art,</hi> I say for it was his <hi>Motto, He that win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
souls is wise;</hi> and he did profess to a friend, as Bishop <hi>Williams</hi>
once did, that though he had gone through several honorable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
yet he would take more comfort in begetting one
soul to God, (in travailing in birth till Christ were formed in an
immortal spirit) than in gaining all the honors in the world to
<hi>himself:</hi> he was one of those Reverend Divines the late King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to converse with in his solitude, and to advise with in his
Treaties; and one of them the Parliament feared most, making
the Kingdom his Church when he had none, and instilling every

where wholesome notions, and rectified apprehensions into mens
minds, as likewise implanting the truth after godliness in their
hearts; teaching men not to be linked to this or that body of men

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, play the Philosopher in his sufferings, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his tribulations <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> learned afflictions, full of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
which taught, he said, much real Christianity, and made
his soul of a more strong, able, and athletick habit and temper;
speaking in his distresses, that he hoped he had learned all that,
for which God sent it; and that he thought God kept us so long in
that dispensation, under those pressures and sufferings, that Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
might have its perfect work; and that the world might see
what the true Protestant Religion was able to do; what might,
power, and virtue there was in it, to bear up souls under the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
misfortunes. <hi>This</hi> (would he say) <hi>is the time to let men see, we
can live up at the same rate, as we have formerly discoursed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Four things he had a special care of in the late times.</p>
            <p>1. The Confirmation of well-affected People, and the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Children from house to house, where he was the more
welcome by the sweetness and chearfulness of his converse.</p>
            <p>2. The furnishing of private Schools and Families, with those
excellent Scholars and honest <hi>Men,</hi> to whom <hi>Zenodotus</hi> his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb
was very applicable in those times, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Either he is dead, or he teacheth School.</hi> Expressing himself about that
Care of his, as Sir <hi>Walter Mildmay</hi> did about <hi>Emanuel Colledge,</hi>
whereof he was Founder, <hi>That he set Acorns, which others might live
to see Oaks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The restraining of the Kings friends, from rash and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
expressions or actions, <hi>That the Tyranny</hi> (to use his own words)
<hi>might wear its self out upon their patience, which might seed its self
upon their peevishness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. To widen his Majesties Interest, by matching his friends to
some of his, not implacable and more generous foes, who should
espouse their Cause, as well as their Relations intermarriages (as
he observed by the care God took in that case among his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
being able to turn the humor of any Nation.</p>
            <p>In fine, having saved the Plate and Books of <hi>Sion-Colledge</hi> in
<hi>London</hi> when he was President, having bestowed his own upon the
Church to which he owed it (hating to enrich private Families in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Pride, with the publick emoluments of the Church, given to
Piety) and having led an exact and an exquisite life, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in a conversation so studied, that it was in all things conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with its self, in most unaffected gravity, wonderful simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and a stern Countenance, proportionable to the vigor and
strength of his Soul: <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: a look that
was not one key below his intent, eager, and sprightly minde;
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:59370:263"/>
wholly careful of the things he hoped for, and regardless of the
things he saw. He died in a good old age, 1662/3.</p>

narrowly learned, not fond of the School Rudiments he was ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated

and <hi>Westminster,</hi> he was, as appears by his many occasional Ser'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
much respected.</p>
            <p>1. For his Disputations with, and Writings against Popery;
especially, when Bishop <hi>White</hi> had wisely cast the Net to take <hi>Fisher,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Featley</hi> helped to draw it out.</p>
            <p>2. For his constant Preaching, having not missed the morning
Sermon, as then observed, for five years together, so even and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
grows the excellent man.</p>
            <p>3. The savouriness of his Sermons, not altogether Wit, for that
had been to feed his Hearers with Sawce instead of Meat; nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
with Disputation, for that were to feed them with
Stones instead of Bread; but setting before them wholesome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:59370:275"/>
in an exact method, and an acute expression.</p>
            <p>4. His Faithful adherence to his Flock during two great Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
in one of which he Composed that excellent Piece so often
Printed, called, <hi>The Handmaid to Devotion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. His value of good men, particularly Mr. <hi>Tho. Gataker</hi> (whom
he carried always in his Bosom, as he did him an overseer of his
life) Son of <hi>Tho. Gataker</hi> Minister of St. <hi>Edmund Lumbard-street,</hi>
Scholar of St. <hi>Iohns,</hi> one of the first Fellows of <hi>Sidney</hi> Colledge,
who grew a good Divine by Family-exercises at Mr. <hi>Ailoffes</hi> house

by Sir <hi>Henry Hobart</hi> and Sir <hi>R. Crew,</hi> to prevent an Abby-lubber)
and where as in <hi>Lincolns-Inn</hi> he reformed Sabbath-Abuses, and
Preached freely a Catachetical Lecture every Friday throughout
the body of Divinity) for forty two years. One whose memory
was the best Library extant, whose family was an Academy for
Englishmen and Foreigners, with whom he compared Studies
every night, to his and their great advantage: correspondence
with <hi>Salmasius</hi> and others, universal as his study, whose charity
was secret, meekness open, self-denial in waving Prince <hi>Henries</hi>
service, and the Earl of <hi>Manchesters</hi> offer of the Mastership of
<hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi> signal, having travelled to the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>
1620. having been four times Married, Visitor of three
publick Schools, seen ten of his assistants eminent Ministers in the
Church, gone through the body of Divinity in his Family nine
times, having written twenty two Books in Latine, and sixteen in
English of his, and revised above an hundred Books of others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing

            <p>To make up this Catalogue compleat, I will conclude with,</p>
            <p>1. Dr. <hi>Cattesford,</hi> Rector of <hi>Hadley</hi> and <hi>Monks-Ely</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred
for a strict observation of the Canons, for intreating the
people to repair to their Ministers for Ghostly Comfort and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise,
for refusing to read the Parliaments Declarations, or approve
of their Proceedings.</p>
            <p>2. Dr. <hi>Roberts,</hi> Fellow of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge, and Rector of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bledon</hi>
in the County of <hi>Bucks;</hi> a grave and modest man, a
general Scholar, and an accurate Preacher, Sequestred for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
it unlawful upon any pretence to raise Armes against the
King; a Doctrine which he made good by the Testimonies of all
the Fathers, and Modern Divines; and was told, that if they were
alive now, they would be of another minde.</p>
            <p>3. Dr. <hi>N. Andrews,</hi> Rector of <hi>Guilford,</hi> and Vicar of <hi>Godliman</hi> in
<hi>Surrey,</hi> Sequestred for saying, that long Sermons went beyond St.
<hi>Peters</hi> Sword, cutting off both Ears; and that the surfeit of the
Word is most dangerous, and that Prayer was as good as Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and for lifting up the Bread and Wine at the consecration of
it with reverence; together with his dislike of reprobation, and
refusing to publish their Orders about destroying the Ornaments
of the Church.</p>
            <p>4. Dr. <hi>Io. Mountford,</hi> Rector of <hi>Austie,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
Sequestred for saying that God was present by the presence
of his Grace in the places of his Worship, and therefore he reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
God when he came into such a place, usually ordering that
part of the 43. <hi>Psalm, Then shall I to the Altar go, of God,</hi> &amp;c. to be sung
as he went to second Service; for tying Lecturers to Catechise with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Iurisdiction, for religiously adorning his Church and Chancel.</p>
            <p>5. Dr. <hi>Iames Mountford,</hi> Rector of <hi>Tewing,</hi> in the County of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
Sequestred for bringing his people to order and discipline, as
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:59370:276"/>
Kneeling at Communions, and for teaching, <hi>That if the King were
an Idolater, we should not</hi> (as the Apostles did not) <hi>take Armes against
him;</hi> together with refusing to contribute to the Parliament Cause,
and discouraging them that did.</p>
            <p>6. Dr. <hi>Iefferies,</hi> Fellow of <hi>Pembroke-hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Chaplain
to Archbishop <hi>Abbot,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Feversham</hi> and <hi>Ticehurst</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> a
methodical Scholar, and a melting Preacher, Sequestred for
Preaching that the Episcopal Government was Apostolical; that
Bishops, Priests, and Deacons under the Gospel, answered to High-priests,
Priests, and Levites under the Law; as the Presbyterians
did <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram;</hi> for not admitting the House of
Commons Lecturer into his Church, and not observing their Fasts:
a mirror of patience under tortures of the Gout racking his whole
body: He died at Mr. <hi>Challenor Chutes</hi> house, who said he would
plead for Bishops as long as he had a tongue, 1658.</p>
            <p>7. Dr. <hi>Io. Gorsuck</hi> of <hi>Walherne</hi> in <hi>Hertford-shire,</hi> Sequestred for
sending a good horse to serve his Majesty, and a bad one to serve
the Parliament.</p>
            <p>8. Mr. <hi>Ed. Thurman,</hi> Rector of <hi>Hallingbury</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> for pressing
his Parishioners to receive the Communion orderly at the Rails.</p>
            <p>9. Dr. <hi>Edward Marten,</hi> Minister of <hi>Houghton-Conquest</hi> in <hi>Bedford-shire,</hi>
and of <hi>Dunnington</hi> in <hi>Cambridge-shire,</hi> Sequestred for blessing God
for the examples of the Saints departed, and Preaching much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
holy Reverence and Obedience; as likewise for lending and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Majesty money, besides those turned out in both Universities,
for refusing the Covenant, and disowning the Parliaments Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to Visit the Universities, whereof his Majesty was by their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
Visitor, as his Predecessors were Founders in <hi>Oxford.</hi>

            <p>Dr. <hi>Samuel Fell,</hi> Student, Prebendary, and Dean of <hi>Christ-Church,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>

turned out so violently, that his sick Wife was carried out in
a Chair, to make way to a Presbyterian successor, as his was a little
while after <hi>(Digitus Dei)</hi> to make way for an Independent one.
Dying heart-broken, not for his own sufferings, but his Majesties;
he left a Son heir of his zeal, the Reverend Dr. <hi>Io. Fell</hi> now Dean
of <hi>Christ Church,</hi> who kept up the Devotions and Orders of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> in his Brother-in-law Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> the accurate
Natural Philosopher and Physician at <hi>Oxford,</hi> Lodgings and
House, supported the Members of it by a great part of his <hi>Estate,</hi>

               <hi>York-shire</hi> and <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> bred under a methodical Master at
<hi>Lincoln</hi> School, and an exact Tutor at <hi>Lincoln</hi> Colledge, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
his pregnant Wit, his large Understanding, his faithful
Memory, his solid Judgment, made more so by method and a
deep Apprehension, his hopeful Seriousness, his silent Sedentary,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:59370:277"/>
and astonishing Industry, to that exactness, which stuck to him to
his dying day (and he would observe that exactness or strictness in
laying the grounds of Learning, had their respective influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
upon the superstructure.) In his younger days he learned
an Art of Memory, for being enjoyed, when young, to learn what
he understood not, he was compelled to make use of similitudes,
and to remember those things he knew not, by thinking upon
something like them he knew. Being Serious in his Design, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in his Study, Industrious in his Way, Clear in his Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Searching in his Disquisitions, Serene, Orderly, and Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
in his thoughts; Sober and Civil in his Carriage (his Tuition
having added to his great parts, that Humility, Meekness, Modesty,
Obedience, and Civility, as advantaged by his good Disposition,
rendred him to his last, Submissive to Superiors, Obliging to his
Equals, Tender to his Inferiors, Affable and Charitable, (good Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
in youth begets an habit of Obedience in riper years) his
thoughtful Soul strugling with the Intricacies, Perplexities, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Confusion of Nature; and intent upon a genuine Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of things, rather than a toilsome Collection of words,
save so much Grammar as enabled him to speak his minde <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
so much Rhetorick, as to express it <hi>Perswasively;</hi> and so much
Logick, as might order, guide, and direct his thoughts <hi>Methodical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>
in apprehending things <hi>Distinctly,</hi> in judging of them <hi>Exactly,</hi>
in finding out the truth that lieth in them <hi>Successfully,</hi> in discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the errors, deceits, and fallacies imposed upon us, about them
<hi>Evidently;</hi> and urging the truths found out <hi>Convincingly.</hi> His
way was,</p>
            <p>1. To write the Rules his Tutor suggested, or his Books afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(for he writ most he read, or heard, as he said, <hi>To stay his active
and young soul upon things, till he had distinctly conceived them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. To debate the Rules he writ with his friends, whereof he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
kept a Club.</p>
            <p>3. To practise them upon some question or other, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
as his native reason, as his own soul, whereby he attained
afterwards in all cases a great happiness to comprehend things
deeply and fully, State Controversies exactly, to lay them before
others clearly, solidly, compendiously, and impartially; to find out
the merit of a cause, the right state of a question exactly, reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
convincingly and demonstratively, alledging closely and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently,
with observations choice and prudent, deductions clear
and genuine, expressions apt, suitable, weighty, and accurate; and
the whole discourse even and steady, made up of abstract notions
of reason, experience and religion; being sure to state the words
in a question or case. <hi>What is controverted (as there will be very little
when words, and things are well understood) must be clearly laid down</hi>
(would he say) <hi>as it is understood on all hands, and convincingly proved
by a proper reason from the nature of the thing, or uncontrouled autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
pressed and cleared from all evasions, cavils, and</hi> Subter-fuges;
<hi>which cavils must be proposed faithfully, and honestly, and answered
breifly, fully, ingeniously, candidly, and modestly.</hi> Insomuch, that as

weaknesses of reason, and the respective remedies. Eleven
hours was his usual allotment for study, though there was hardly
a minute of his time but was full of his affairs either of necessity,
civility, or study. It cost him so much sad thoughts to go through
any subject in his unnering and accurate way, that as he writes in
his Preface to the book of the Obligation of Conscience, that he
could do nothing untill he needs must; his mind running up and

with the expectation of the University and the Church,
together with his own inclination (who would always say, <hi>That

            <p>Where 1. his care was to settle and maintain friendship and

            <p>2. His Sermons were rational and just discourses upon pertinent

whereof he weighed <hi>duly;</hi> the various reading he considered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:59370:278"/>
the explication he made out of the choicest Authors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
and the most proper Learning, clearly pithy and pertinent Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
Learned, Moral, and Divine: as he went on in explication
he dropped <hi>judiciously;</hi> pitching upon the great Observations
couched in the several parts usefully and distinctly (not liking the
wresting of the Scripture (for a truth) lost custom in that taught
us to wrest it to an error) bottoming them upon their proper
Grounds and Reasons, orderly as they lay in the Body of Divinity
and of Learning, and improving them to the respective duties of
Morality, or Christianity, rationally inferred skilfully; drawing
first the Schem of his Sermon, and then filling it up with all sorts
of Learning, he having the principles at least of every Art and
Science.</p>
            <p>3. His Exposition of the Church Catechism was constant and
practical.</p>
            <p>4. His Preparations for Sacraments were solemn.</p>
            <p>5. His and his Families attendance on the Prayers of the Church,
was exemplary.</p>
            <p>6. His endeavors to keep Peace, Charity, and Hospitality by his
precepts and example, were successful.</p>
            <p>7. His Visits edifying.</p>
            <p>8. His directions not to relieve the wandring poor as charitable,
as his Alms to the regular ones; he being as severe in restraining
the disorderly Vagabonds, as compassionate in relief of the <hi>orderly
poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. The great satisfaction he gave to his Neighbor-Gentry in his
Learned converse, being (as he advised young Ministers to be in this
knowing age) well seen in History, Geography, Mathematicks, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanism,
Physick, Law, Herauldry, endeared him to the whole
Country; especially his happy way of reducing all sorts to that
great rule, <hi>What you would have others do unto you, do you unto them.</hi>
And seldom failing in Correspondence and Visits, those great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
for a good understanding and love.</p>
            <p>10. The directions and comforts he collected for the use of the
sick, and the dying, full and exact.</p>

acquaintance upon, generous and profitable.</p>
            <p>12. How proper his discourses at Visitations from Reason, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,

Pretences, Reasons, Interests, and Designs; as long as he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
them withall, that the things injoyned were in their nature
safe, and in their use free; to this good end he reduced most of his
studies, which he managed with plenty of accute, and weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with variety of reading, with full and pertinent citations, with
clear and copious expressions, powerful demonstrations made up
of Scripture-strength, of Counsels-weight, of Fathers-consent, and

found in Orders, he was careful to prefer, and as careful not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

charitable he was, that he relieved the poor; which he said, he was

that is, <hi>poor men,</hi> till he was one of them himself: So tender of
young mens reputation that answered under him, unless they were
self-conceited Paradox-mongers, (for then he would let them
swoun before he gave them any hot water) that he was so a staff to
them, as that the standers by did not see, but that they went upon

            <p>His Answers were quick, as Dr. <hi>Saundersons</hi> were slow and sure

Army he had raised (as the Kings first General against the Earl of
<hi>Essex)</hi> to more experienced Commanders (though he had been a
Souldier abroad) out of prudence, governing his Majesty, then
Prince, under his Tuition, with discretion and moderation; by
bringing his Majesty 60000<hi>l.</hi> of his own and others to set him, by
securing for him forty five Inland Garrisons, and six Sea-towns;
by waiting on his Majesty in his Privy Counsel and Parliament at

to subscribe the untoward Propositions for an accommodation
with the <hi>Scots</hi> 1640. at <hi>York;</hi> but it is as true, that (when he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the bottome of the design) he did of his own accord disown
the unnatural Plot in <hi>London</hi> 1641/2. where the King advanced him
to the tuition of the Prince; and he went himself to the defence
of the King, at what time such his popularity, that he raised an
Army himself; such his humility, that he yielded the Command
of it to another, as if he knew nothing but others merits and his
own wants; being own of those men, that admire every thing in
others, and see nothing in themselves. His face, his carriage, his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
favoured of lowliness without affectation, and yet he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what he seemed. His words were few and soft, never either
peremptory or censorious, because he thought both each man
more wise, and none more obnoxious than himself; being yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorant nor careless, but naturally meek; lying ever close
within himself, armed with those two master-pieces, Resolution
and Duty, wherewith he mated the blackest events, that did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>exercise</hi> than <hi>dismay</hi> that spirit that was <hi>above</hi> them, and that

friend; whom extremities obliged, while he, as a well-wrought
Vault, lay at home the stronger, by how much the more weight he
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:59370:285"/>

of the ancient English Nobility.</p>
            <p>As was his Brother Sir <hi>Francis Seymor,</hi> a wise and religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
a great Patriot in the beginning of King <hi>Charles</hi> his reign for
three Parliaments together (in the first year of whose reign he was
High-sheriff) as long as the people desired reason; and as great a
Courtier towards the latter end of his reign, when he saw some
projectors, under colour of the peoples good, plotting Treason.
He was indeed one of the Lords (being Created Baron of <hi>Trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>

and he was one of them who at <hi>York, Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Vxbridge,</hi>
(for he was at that Treaty) made it evident, that that Parliament
its self, by its Factions, was become a grievance; he himself keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a middle way, between the Kings Prerogative, and the Peoples
Liberty, so widening his Majesties interest to the utmost latitude

Warrant signed by <hi>Bradshaw</hi> the President, to seize and bring him
before them, and to search his Chamber, and break up his Trunks
for Papers; (he then being at <hi>London,</hi> the place most expedient
for the design) which accordingly was done, a file or two of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers
guarding and securing the House, where the said Papers
were; among which there were blank Commissions signed by the
King, to the purport aforesaid, were found with him and carryed
to the Council, who thereupon ordered him to be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:59370:291"/>
as a Spie, and referred him to a Councel of War. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he was soon afterwards tryed by a Court-Martial, where he not
excused himself, but acknowledged their Allegations against him,
and the Justice of his Cause, of which he told them he was no way
ashamed, but if it must be so, he would willingly lay down his
life in the owning of it. He told them moreover, he was indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensably
bound by the Laws of God and this Kingdom to do what
he did, and so referred himself to them. They very earnestly
pressed him to reveal the other parties engaged with him, and
gave him fallacious hopes of life, if he would freely declare them;
but those offers prevailed not with him, being resolved to suffer
and take all upon himself, rather than to ruine others, whom they
could not fasten upon without his discovery.</p>
            <p>So the Court proceeded to Sentence, which was that he should
be hanged over against the Exchange in <hi>Cornhill</hi> in Exchange time;
which after some little preparation was executed, he being
brought in a Coach from the <hi>Mews</hi> with the Executioner Vizarded
with him, and a Troop of Horse to guard him to the said place,
where the Sheriffs received him into their charge. After he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted,
and some words passed between them concerning the said
discovery, he told them they should not expect it, and desired
them to forbear any further trouble to that purpose; and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Sheriffs of that County successively from <hi>Edward</hi> the
Fourths time, to King <hi>Iames;</hi> bred in <hi>Sidney-colledge</hi> in
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> to which he was a Benefactor, the second
year of King <hi>Iames</hi> 1603. Subscribing (I suppose, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Importunities of his Mother, much addicted to that party)
the <hi>Millemanus</hi> Petition about Church-government, concerning
the reason of which subscription King <hi>Iames</hi> used to make good
sport with him; till, being ashamed of himself, he went in Sir
<hi>Francis</hi> and Sir <hi>Horace Veres</hi> Company into the <hi>Low-country</hi> wars,
where by his resolute attempts, and good faculty in projecting, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the way of Entrenching in Garrisons, or Incamping in the
Field, he attained to the Command of the best Regiment of Foot
(Veteranes all, that he was very chary, knowing there was a great
deal of time requisite to make a brave man) in which Command
he continued there till he was called by his Majesty to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
against the <hi>Scots;</hi> in which business, and the design of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Army to <hi>London</hi> 1640. and 1641. to bring the Parliament
and Tumults to reason, the old irreconcileable differences upon a
Duel in <hi>Holland,</hi> between him and my Lord <hi>Willmot,</hi> made no little
obstruction.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of our <hi>English</hi> wars, he was made Captain-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of the Garrison and Fort of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> where he caught
the Country-men that assailed him in a Net, till he was overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and for want of Relief, by the Kings Order, forced to yield,
and take a Pass for <hi>Holland;</hi> whence (using his old interest there
effectually) he returns <hi>December</hi> 15. with a good sum of Money,
great store of Armes, some Piece of Ordnance, and fourscore
old Commanders, joyning to the Earl of <hi>New-castle,</hi> and rendring
him formidable, and assisting him in settling the Contributions of
the Country, till the fatal fight of <hi>Marston-moor</hi> (which was begun
against the Lord <hi>Gorings</hi> minde, though managed in the left wing,
which he Commanded, with success, beating the right wing of Sir
<hi>Tho. Fairfax,</hi> and the Scots Horse upon the Lord <hi>F.</hi> and the Scots
Foot, with great, if not too much execution) after which, with
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:59370:294"/>
that incomparable Souldier Sir <hi>Richard Greenvill,</hi> he laid the Plot
for entrapping <hi>Essex</hi> in <hi>Lestithiel,</hi> with 1500. horse, stopping all
provision from coming in at Saint <hi>Blase,</hi> and reducing them to
streights, by keeping their horse and foot close together; about
which time, making use of their distress, he set on foot the Subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
for an accommodation, <hi>August</hi> 8. 1644. The next news we
hear of him, after a Consultation about carrying on of the war,
between him, the Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Gerard,</hi> (who left all
he had, sticking to his Majesty in all conditions since the Restau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
JOHN Lord DIGBY,
Earl of Bristol.</head>
            <p>THis Noble man was the younger Son of an Ancient
Family of the <hi>Digbies,</hi> long flourishing at <hi>Coleshull</hi> in
<hi>Warwick-shire,</hi> who to pass by his Infancy (all children
are alike in their Long-coats) in his Youth, as his Son
did, gave pregnant hopes of that eminency, which
his Mature Age did produce; and coming to Court
with an Annuity of fifty pounds a year, besides a good Address, and
choice Abilities, both for Ceremonies and business. He kenned
the Ambassadors craft, as well as any man living in his time, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by King <hi>Iames</hi> in several services to forraign Princes, reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in his Patent, as the main motives of the Honors conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him; among which the <hi>Spanish</hi> Match, managed by him from
1616. to 1623. was his master-piece; wherein, if his Lordship
dealt in generalities, and did not press particulars, we may guess
the reason of it from that expression of his: <hi>I will take care to have
my Instructions perfect, and will pursue them punctually.</hi> If he held
affairs in suspence, that it might not come to a war on our side, it
may be he did so, with more regard to his Master King <hi>Iames</hi> his
Inclination, than his own Apprehension: If he said, that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the business went, he would make his fortune thereby; it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
argued the freedom of his spirit that he said so, his sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
that he could do so, than his unfaithfulness that he did do so.
This is certain, that he chose rather to come home, and suffer the
utmost displeasure of the King of <hi>England,</hi> than stay abroad, and
injoy the highest favour of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> He did indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceed
for Indulgence to Papists, but it was, because otherwise he
could do no good beyond sea for the Protestants. <hi>The worst</hi> (saith
a learned Protestant, that conversed with him much at <hi>Exeter,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

after it, he saying, that as long as he had a Loaf, the Doctor should

is, that I may hear from them but half so many strong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

years after the contract with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> which (the
Duke fearing his preventing policy, as he did the Dukes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power)
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:59370:301"/>
became a drawn battel under the Kings displeasure, and
(as the Court-cloud makes the Countries shine) in the peoples fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
yet bestowed his parts and interest in the beginning of the

resolution and nobleness at top, being carried from Village to

            <head>THE
Life and Death
OF
Dr. WILLIAM JUXON,
Lord Arch-bishop of Canterbury;</head>
            <p>BOrn at <hi>Chichester</hi> in <hi>Sussex,</hi> and bred in St. <hi>Iohns</hi> Colledge
in <hi>Oxford,</hi> whereof he was Fellow and President; his
deep and smooth parts (as appears by his Speeches and
Poetry on publick Occasions, particularly on King
<hi>Iames</hi> his death) exceeding his years, and yet his modesty and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertues so exceeding as to hide his Parts, had not he been dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>covered
for Preferment by the Perfume of his worth, as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man
Gentleman was by the sweet Odour of his Cloaths for punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> had taken great notice of his Parts and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
when he was Fellow with him, but greater of his Integrity
and policy, when a stickler (in the Suit about President-ship of the
Colledge) against him. When observing him a shrewd Adversary,
he thought he might be a good Friend, being though Doctor of
Law, yet a great Master of Divinity, all hearing him Preach with
great pleasure and profit, so much he had of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> of
learned plainness, and an useful elaborateness: when he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(saith one that heard him) <hi>Of Mortification, Repentance, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christian</hi> Practicks, <hi>he did it with such a stroke of unaffected Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
of potent Demonstration, and irresistible Conviction, that jew</hi>
Agrippaes, Festaes, or Felixes, <hi>that heard, but must needs for the time
and fit, be almost perswaded to be penitent and mortified Christians.</hi>
Dr. <hi>Laud</hi> finding him shining in each place, he was as the Divine
Lights in their Orbs without noise, his Birth so Gentile, that it was
no disgrace to his Parts, though not so Illustrious, but that his
Parts might be an Ornament to him; his Vertues so modest, that
they hid themselves from <hi>others,</hi> and so humble, that they were
not known to <hi>himself:</hi> A temper as little moved with others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
as with his own merits; fit to Rule others, that command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
its self; Recreations Innocent and manly, traversing Hills and
Dales for Health and for Instruction, studying God at home, and
Nature abroad; fitting himself by generous Exercises for generous
Employments, to which he knew a body comely, quick, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
with Exercise, was more suitable than a minde dulled with
studies. Though when he came to his Throne, over affections, the
Pulpit, or his Chair of State, over reason his Colledge, it appeared
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:59370:309"/>
that his severe pleasures that refreshed his body, loosned; but
melted not his minde. I say, sagacious Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> finding him every
way, rather than designing him, his successor, brought him out of
his privacy, as Pearls and rich mettals are out of obscurity, to
adorn his Majesties Court, his modesty gaining him that respect
which others seek by their ambition. To have one near the King
he could trust in his old age, made him Dean of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and
Clerk of the Closet first, after that Bishop elect of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and
then after himself Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and Lord Treasurer. In the
first of which places, being to have Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> combate with
Beasts, he used Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> art, became all things to all, and as those
that were of old exposed to Beasts, overcame by yielding, being
most mild, and most vigilant; a Lamb, and a Shepheard. The
delight of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, whose Reverence was the only thing
all Factions agreed in, all allowing that honor to the sweetness of
his manners, that some denied the sacredness of his Function;
being by love, what another is in pretence, an universal Bishop;
the greatest, because the last Bishop that was ruined, that insolence
that stuck not at the other Bishops, out of modesty, till 1649. not
medling with him. The other charge of<note n="a" place="margin">Which no Clergy-man held since Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Gray,</hi> who was Lord Treasurer 9. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4.</note> Treasurer (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

he in the middest of large Expences, and low Revenues, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged
with such integrity, handling temporal wealth with the
same holy temper he did the most spiritual Mysteries, that the
Coffers he found empty, he in four years left filling; and with such
prudent mildness, being admirably master of his Pen, and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
grace having ordered what nature could not omit, the <hi>tetrarch</hi>
humor of Choler. That Petitioners for money (when it was not
to be had) departed well pleased with his civilly languaged deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
and though a Bishop was then odious, and a Lord always sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
yet he in both capacities was never questioned; though if
he had, he had come out of his trial like his gold, having this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
in an age of the bravest men, to see more innocent than the
best, and happier than the greatest; and if it was a comfort to
them to suffer for their too great, and to the Commonalty unknown,
and therefore suspected virtues; it was more to him, to be loved
for that integrity, which could be unk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>own to few, and hateful to
none.</p>
            <p>He was above others in most of his actions, he was above himself
in two.</p>
            <p>1. His honest advice to save my Lord of <hi>Straffords</hi> life, who
having appeared before a Parliament, was set at last before him;
who though he heard Noblemen, yea Clergy-men too, pressing his
death for the safety of the people, the highest law, they said, the
King, the Church, the Commonwealth; asserting his life by law
and right, which is above all these: And that brave Maxime, like
another <hi>Athanasius</hi> of Justice against the world. <hi>Fiat justitia, &amp;
ruat coelum &amp; terra; Ecclesia &amp; Respublica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="597" facs="tcp:59370:309"/>
2. His holy attendance on his late Majesty (who gave him the
title on his death of <hi>That honest man,</hi> whereof before in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
Life and Death. Recollecting there all his virtues, to <hi>see</hi> what
the excellent King, with a recollection of all graces, was to suffer;
with a clear countenance, at least, before his Majesty, chusing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
nature, rather than the King, looking on what his Majesty,
with a chearful countenance, endured. Thus the Sun at our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
Passion (whereof this a Copy) that was Ecclipsed to others,
shined clear to Christ. It was much to see the King dye with so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
a spirit; it was more to see the Bishop behold him with
so unmoved a countenance; but so it became him, whom his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
had chosen his Second, in that great Duel, committing to
him the care of his soul, both departing in himself, and surviving
in his Son; and with it his memory, and what was more, his Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion;
with which, and the other holy suggestions of that Royal
soul, he came down from the Scaffold, as <hi>Moses</hi> did out of the
Mount, with Pardon, Peace, and New Law to a sinful people, after
the breaking of the old.</p>

having patience to bear those pains, which others had not patience

he had corrected nature as a fault in Children: the ingenious and

a matter and subject as noble as its nature, making his Verses
not in his Study at St. <hi>Peters-house,</hi> but in his Devotions, wherein he
spent many a night, at St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church; warbling his Hymns

no other <hi>Helicon,</hi> than the <hi>Iordan</hi> of his eyes; nor <hi>Parnassus,</hi>
than the <hi>Sion</hi> where dwelled his thoughts, that made the Muses
Graces, and taught Poems to do what they did of old, propagate
Religion, and not so much Charm as Inspire the Soul. <hi>Hebrew,
Greek, Latine, Spanish, French, Italian,</hi> were as familiar to him as
<hi>English.</hi> Philosophy came as plausible from him as his Speeches or
Sermons; those thronged Sermons on each Sunday and Holiday,
that ravished more like Poems, than both the Poet and Saint (two
<note n="c" place="margin">A. C.</note> of the most sacred names in heaven and earth) scattering not
so much Sentences and Extasies, his soul breahing in each word,
was the soul of the Assembly, as its original is of the World. Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Musick, Drawing, Limning, Graving, (exercises of his curious
Invention, and sudden Fancy) were the subservient recreations of
his vacant hours, not the grand business of his soul; his diet was
temperate, to a Lesson exactness, whence his memory was so clear,
that he had ready at his service the choicest treasures of Greek
and Latine Poets, those <hi>Gibeonites</hi> to draw water to the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
The Divine Poet, that had set a Language (made up of the
Quintessence of Fancy and Reason) for the Angels (as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
state their way of discourse) to converse in; seeing Atheism
prevailing in <hi>England,</hi> embraced Popery in <hi>Italy,</hi> chusing rather to
live in the Communion of that corrupt Church, in the practise of
fundamental truths, confessed to be then mixed with some errors,
than to stay here, where was hardly the face of any Church, after
the overthrow of those to make way for all errors; being resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to any Religion, than that which taught a holy Rebellion<note n="d" place="margin">He was turned out for not taking the Covenant.</note>
and Perjury, a pious Sacriledge, a godly Parracide, and made the
very horrors of nature, the glory of Christianity. And died of a
Feaver, the holy order of his soul over-heating his body, Canon
of <hi>Loretto,</hi> whence he was carried to heaven, as that Church was
brought thither by Angels, singing.</p>

The King would say of him, that he was a man of a clear

in his business, sticking not at any difficulties: all the succors the

home was managed by his conveyance: neither was he less vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant

offering himself upon a tryal by a noble Counsel of War, by whom

comfort him at his death, for when his friends that stood by him

(reserving his passion till the issue of the discourse) said he,
if you desire me in a gentle fashion, I shall acquaint you farther:
whereupon <hi>Luynes</hi> bowing a little, said, <hi>very well:</hi> the Ambassador
answered, That it was not on this occasion only that the King of
<hi>Great Britain</hi> had desired the peace and prosperity of <hi>France:</hi> and
that upon the settlement of that Kingdom, he hoped the <hi>Palatinate</hi>
might be the better assisted. <hi>Luynes</hi> returned, We will have none of
your advices: the Ambassador replied, <hi>He took that for an answer;</hi>
being sorry the King his Masters affections were not suitably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented:
adding, that since it was so, he knew well what to do.
And being answered that the <hi>French</hi> feared him not; returns smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
If you had said you had not loved us, I should have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
you; and made no other answer, In the mean time all that I
will tell you more, is, That we know very well what we have to
do. <hi>Luynes</hi> thereupon rising from his chair discomposed, said, <hi>By
God, If you were not the Monsieur Ambassadour, I know very well how I
would use you.</hi> Sir <hi>Edward</hi> rising also from his chair, said, That as he
was his Majesty of <hi>Great Britains</hi> Ambassador, so he was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>and that his Sword</hi> (whereon he laid his hands) <hi>should do him
reason, if he had taken any offence;</hi> adding, when the Marshal of
<hi>Geran</hi> after a more civil audience of the King, told him that he was
not safe there, since he had so highly affronted <hi>Luynes</hi>) That <hi>he
held himself to be secure enough, where ever he had his Sword by him.</hi>

A Catalogue of Worthies, that instilled into their respective Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
the good principles of Allegiance, and were able to go to
the charge of then; most of them most active (as natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are most swift) towards the end of the War: when (the air
being corrected by cold and nipping misfortune) there was no
danger of taking the Kings side, as some did in warmer times only
by Infections; professing themselves better able to manage great
miscarriages, than a great success: most of them provided for the
War suitable supplies, while others performed in it great actions.
Admiral <hi>Colligni</hi> was wont to say, <hi>He that would paint the Beast War,
must first begin to shape the Belly:</hi> meaning that the chiefest care in
War should be the supply of the Army. Many of whose Ladies

the War more then Women. One especially, who trained a Pigeon
to carry Letters, which were sent as they were written, with the

            <p>14. Sir <hi>Thomas Ailesbury,</hi> one of the Masters of Request to King

            <p>15. Sir <hi>William Valentine Lane,</hi> and Col. <hi>Io. Osburn</hi> Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi>
old Souldiers, at whose advance such a calm of Cowardize seized

            <p>16. Sir <hi>Io. Monson</hi> of <hi>South-Carleton Lincoln.</hi> a good Lawyer as

Counsels, and one in all Treaties, for which he paid 2642 <hi>l.</hi> being
permitted a quiet retirement, for the same reason King <hi>Iohn</hi> being
urged to untomb the bones of an Enemy, permitted him a quiet
grave, <hi>Oh no</hi> (said he) <hi>were all my Enemies as honorably buryed.</hi> To
whom I must annex Sir <hi>Steven Hawkings,</hi> never separated from him
either in his services or sufferings; a Commander of his Majesties
Army, and an eminent man in his Counsel, as were Sir <hi>Thomas Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerston,</hi>
Sir <hi>Gilbert Houghton,</hi> Sir <hi>William Hart,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Hastings,</hi>

their Brethren) and deserving it every where but among our pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks,
who raised mean men to Authority, as the <hi>Goths</hi> had a
Law always to chuse a short thick man for their King: most of
them bred Scholars, and when exchanging their Caps for Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
not putting off their Learning with their Habit. <hi rend="margQuotes">For
though bookishness may be unactive, yet Scholarship doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish

            <p>18. Dr. <hi>William Iohnson</hi> Fellow of <hi>Queens,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Nicholas Bernard</hi>
Fellow of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Parallels in most of their vertues
and most of their sufferings. The first at once, the most <hi>witty</hi> and
<hi>pious</hi> man living; the other Master of the greatest Mirth and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
in the World: Both happy in sanctified Fancies and Parts,
both bred with eminent men, the one with <hi>B. B.</hi> the other with
Bishop <hi>Vsher,</hi> whose Instrument he was in making many and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Observations and Collections, and whose Trustee he was in
reference to his Reputation and Remains; the first of which he
often vindicated, and the latter he often published, both suffering
equally, the one turned out of his Fellowship and all his Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in <hi>England;</hi> and the other out of his Deanery and all his
Estate in <hi>Ireland,</hi> both men of miraculous deliverances, the one at
Sea, when forced to serve the <hi>Levant</hi> or the <hi>Indian</hi> Merchants,
where he was twice shipwracked, living for four days without
any sustenance, and at last relieved only by that money which
was stollen from him and the Company, by one that was to die
with them; a strange itch to stealing, when one takes that which
neither they that lost, nor he that took it could keep for ought
they knew two hours to an end. The other saved at the taking of
<hi>Drogedah,</hi> when all others were put to the sword, because the
Souldiers breaking into his Chamber, found him at Prayers: both
persons of great fidelity, intrusted with the Legacies and Charities
of more private Benefactors than any two men in <hi>England,</hi> and
both called to manage publick Largesses, the one being Sub-almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and the other Almoner to
an Office though imposed upon him, possibly with design he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
certainly with integrity. The first died Archdeacon of
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:59370:362"/>
               <hi>Huntington,</hi> 1666. and is buried at <hi>Westminster,</hi> having great appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of the sad state of things amongst us, by the same token-that
the last time I saw him, he was very inquisitive what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
History there was (besides Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> and the troubles of <hi>Frank
ford)</hi> of the Confessors Exile and Sufferings in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes'
and the other died Rector of <hi>Whitchurch</hi> in <hi>Shropshire,</hi> where he is
buried, fearing and suspecting the settlement of <hi>Ireland,</hi> because
he chose rather to take a Parsonage here, than to return to his
Dignities thither. They were both Inns of Court-preachers, the
one Master of the <hi>Temple,</hi> where he was as in all places he came to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
in the extraordinary pains he took in Expounding,
Praying, and Preaching; the other Preacher of <hi>Grays-Inn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. Dr. <hi>Ieremy Taylor,</hi> born in <hi>Cambridge</hi> Town, and bred in

and Fortunes (for his Father was a Barber) supplied his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow
Mr. <hi>Risdens</hi> turn in the <hi>Pauls</hi> Lecture three or four times
with such applause above his years, that Archbishop <hi>Laud</hi> that
great Judge and Patron of able men, observing the tartness of his
discourses, the quickness of his Parts, the modesty and sweetness
of his temper, and the becomingness of his personage and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
preferred him Fellow of <hi>All Souls Oxford,</hi> where he might
have Time, Books, and company to compleat himself in those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts of Learning, whereinto he had made so fair an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance:
An admirable Specimen of his progress wherein he gave
in his full Sermon against the Papists, <hi>November</hi> 5. 1638. preached
to the University at St. <hi>Maries Oxford,</hi> and Dedicated to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and being a compleat Artist, especially an
accurate Logician (whereby he reduced all his Learning to such
a method, that he was the readiest in it of any man in his time)
notwithstanding the loss of his Church-preferments, and which
was more to him, his time, by his necessary attendance on his

and his indeavor to make men holy and serious, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to his pains, to make or keep them good Subjects and

               <hi>Liberty of Prophecying,</hi> which he writ to weaken Presbytery by
pleading for Liberty to all other Sects, as well as to undermine it,
as it had undermined Episcopacy; he having published them with
submission, and explained them with moderation and Ingenuity,
