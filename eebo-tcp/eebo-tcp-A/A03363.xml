            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the gentle
Reader.</head>
            <p>Thought it good (gentle Reader) to admonishe
<hi>I</hi> thee in two or three lynes, what mine intent &amp; meaning is, in
renuing againe of this little Treatise: for although an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
reader may iudge therof, yet all mens natures not being
a like to auoyde the cauils of busie heades, and the byting speaches
of Zoylus broode, I am aduised to interpret mine owne meaning:
My purpose according to my duetie is to doe good, nature bindeth,
my countrie chalengeth, &amp; euery good man according to his talent
&amp; power ought to fulfil the same. God thretneth: the deuine to such
as will heare, cryeth repentaunce: to such as can not away wyth
that kinde of speache, but desireth sweeter and more delectable
geare, the Player with his stage matters, by an other kinde of more
pleasant meanes admonisheth, and by a plaine demonstration put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
euery man in minde of his vocation. I professing no diuinitie,
nor yet acquainted with playing inuention, haue by an other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
(if it were possible) put thee in remembraunce of thy duetie to
Godward: we see Gods mercifulnesse, hee seldome punisheth but
sendeth before his messengers, tokens and wonders to forewarne
vs, if we were not dulheades, we might perceyue the same, but if we
had grace, we woulde indeuour our selues to amendment.</p>
            <p>Before God destroyed his owne Citie Ierusalem, he caused to
appeare in the element wonderfull and terrible visions. Before the
imperiall seate of Constantine was translated, signes and tokens
were seene in the ayre. God (as wee maye reade in Cronicles) sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or neuer made alterations in kingdomes, but he before sent
in Ambassage, his threatning Creatures. To seeke for olde and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
examples we neede not, seeing we haue ynough of late dayes
at home, freshe in our memories, as first he by burning his owne
house, brought a present terrour into the mindes of many, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them to call on his name, and generally foreshewed, that as he
spared not that place, wherein his name was dayly called on, no
more would he spare the people, that despised his lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces
(and soone after) it came so to passe, for when the warnin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
woould not be taken, he punished more seuerely: hee sent a gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
mortalitie, and sweeped or tooke away a great number.</p>
            <p>God is iust and mercifull, for iust he is in punishing, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
in forgiuing. The continual bearing of monsters, the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

               </gap>ations, doe
threaten Gods iustice, in punishing the offenders, and his clemencie
and mercie, by fauouring vs so gently. God notwithstanding, that
he threatned Niniuie, by the mouth of his Prophete, yet did hee
mercifully forgiue them, vpon their repentance. God poure out hys
spirite vpon vs, and giue vs his grace to acknowledge and bewaile
our offences, so shall we be spared with Niniuie, and the Lorde will
turne away all his threatnings, into forgiuenesse. It is high time we
repent: God threatneth, we are in daunger, compassed on euery side,
all things are readie, nothing wanteth but Gods permission.</p>
            <p>I haue bene somewhat longer (gentle Reader) than at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
I promised or purposed: yet take this (for breuitie sake)
but for an enteraunce, of a great deale more, that might
aptly be here vttered: the rest vntouched, I commit
to thy iudgement and vnderstanding. Thus
resting, I craue none other than your
friendly report, in furthering
this Treatise.</p>

of <hi>Albertus,</hi> is
an earthlye grosse va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour,

gather to it, ascending
from the lowest parte of

of the same: where, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire that toucheth the

               <p>4. A Comet is an earthly exhalation,
hote and drie, fatte and clammie, with the

vnto the vpper region of the aire, where,

the space of time is most short, in which a

is séene manye tymes for. 40. dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither,

the thirtie day, or sooner: but neuer ending

from the Cast, into the West: the seconde
from the West, into the East: and the

               <p>A Comet (after the minde of <hi>Cardanus</hi>)
is oftner engendred in the North, and

the North, in which part I obserued (sayth
<hi>Cardanus</hi>) thrée Comets in thrée seuerall
yeres. In the night, after the Euening, are
Comets apparantly séene: yet not the like
in the day, except by a mightie meanes and
occasion. It is manifest, that many Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
may be séene togither: as in the age
of <hi>Carolus Martellus,</hi> in the month of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarie,
were two Comets séene within
fourtéene dayes togither, of which the one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18181:7"/>

appeared togither, in the yeare of mannes
health, 1337. which not in a short time, in
that as companions they ended togither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
two monthes complete. And to the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

               <head>How some interprete the motion
of Comets.</head>
               <p>THere be some (sayth <hi>Cardanus</hi>) which
thus write of Comets: that if they
tende toward the South, such signifie raine
to insue: if vnto the North, then drought to
follow, if vnto the East, then the pestilence,
and other mightie daungers: if vnto the
West, then the best or a happie yeare, and
temperate. And the like <hi>Porphirius</hi> (that
worthie Philosopher) wrote, but as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
deceyued in this, séeing a Comet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding
against the order of the signes, doth
<pb facs="tcp:18181:8"/>
signifie the mutation of lawes: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cause,
the Comet which tendeth from the East
into the West, signifieth the alteration of
lawes, in that it is caried agaynst the order
of the signes: so that when it may signifie
the same alone, it happeneth that a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
yeare followeth, yet doth it not signifie
the temperament of the yeare. The kinds
and sundrie formes of Comets, maye you

               <head>The ende, effect, and significations
of Comets.</head>
               <p>THe ende of Cometes, is to prepare
drought, the Pestilence, hunger, battels,
the alteration of kingdomes, and common
weales, and the traditions of men. Also
windes, earthquakes, dearth, land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>louds,
and great heate to follow. The sayde Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets
portende, both many other harmes,
and that mightie to men.</p>
               <p>2 A Comet is the note of a great drougth
in that a meane heate cannot resolue such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
matter out of the earth, and draine th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
same vp.</p>
               <p>3 The second effect of a Comet is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennesse
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18181:8"/>
of the earth, hunger, and the
dearth of vittayles, in that the earth is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
barren through much drougth, and lack
of moysture, for drougth is as the stepmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnto all fruites, and corne of the earth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
but moysture is the apt mother vnto all
fruites, and crescent things on the earth.
So that such a mightie heat, doth excéeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
drie vp the earth, and consumeth the
moysture in plantes, and trées, through
which, they decay, and heare no yéelde, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>store
of fruite. Or thus.</p>
               <p>A Comet doth cause harrennesse of the
earth, in that vnto a Comet, a great and
much exhalation is required, by whose ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
from the earth, the fatnesse of the
earth is so drawne vp, which thus eleuated,
the earth after becommeth harren of yéeld,
and the moysture with which the earth
ought to be battened, is then through the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch
drougth vtterly depriued. For
whiche cause, a Comet is the fore note of
hunger, and dearth in the same Realme:
which it specially beholdeth or stretcheth
the tayle towardes, and from whence it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
and tooke his substance.</p>
               <p>4 Comets doe portend the murraine of
<pb facs="tcp:18181:9"/>
beastes, in that the ayre ensuing is infected
and euill disposed, through the hote, grosse,
and clowdy exhalations: which when beasts
draw thereof, are then intoxicated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
and so die. Also for that the time then
is excéeding hote, and the radicall moysture
is on such wise drawne vp by the hote aire,
from the bodies of men and beastes, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the naturall moysture is placed, as in the
proper seate: of the same beastes, and other
liuing creatures die: for which cause, it is
the minde and councell of the learned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions:
to vse in the same time, moyst and
colde meates, wherby the radicall moysture
may so be increased and preserued.</p>
               <p>5 Comets mooue battels and seditions,
and alter Emperies, and kingdomes: for
that in the time of a Comet, are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations
in the ayre, hote &amp; drie, which doe
drie men, and kindle heat in them, by which
they are lightly prouoked to yre: after which
yre ensueth variance, next of the same fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
battell, and after battell succéedeth
the translation or alteration of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
when as the Emperie ensueth the
conquerour.</p>
               <p>6 Comets do portend the death of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18181:9"/>
kings, gouernors, &amp; other Magistrates
of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale: in that these leade a more
daintie life, and féede on finer meates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallye,
through which they sooner be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
The death besides of princes, and
heade gouernors, through the difference of
many, is of worthier report and fame, and
for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cause more obserued. To these I adde,
that the Choloricke persons are then vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter
mooued, through which, the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations
or troubles of mind ensue, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
seditions and battels, after which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede
oftentimes the slaughter of many, and
death of princes: for that these many tymes
be present in battailes, and are lightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
to yre, by which the battell ensueth
the fiercer: and on such wise, many come
to their death. <hi>Macrobius</hi> left in writing,
that the death of Constantine, was indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a Bushie starre, of an excéeding big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that appeared in the yeare after

               <p>In the yeare of our Lorde. 1214. in the

               <p>In the yeare, 1268. there appeared a

In the yeare of our Lorde. 1553. was

               <p>In the Dukedome of <hi>Brunswike,</hi> was a
marueylous and straunge sight, marked of

husbandman, which accustomed day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to go vnto the wood (to fetch wood home)
and drawing néere to the accustomed place
of the wood (at a certaine time) sawe a farre
off, a great companie of horsemen, which
séemed to come ryding in great haste to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
the village. This seing, the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
returned for the great feare, hastily
backward againe: and being come home so
amased, was demaunded the cause of hys
hastie returning, who answered, that there
were certaine companies of horsemen néere
the towne approched: but from whence they
came, or whether they would, he could not
say: therfore greatly to be doubted (said he)
that these newe guestes will set vpon vs in
<pb facs="tcp:18181:16"/>
the night time. Which tale so amazed the
elders of the towne, that for the great feare,
they tooke councell togither, what was best
to doe in the matter: after the well debating
on the fearefull newes, they issued altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of the towne, to knowe and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
further the intent of these newe
guestes, what they were, from whence they
came, and whether they purposed to go: and
being thus come forth togither out of the
towne, founde and sawe a like company of
horsemen (as the husbande man had before
reported) drawing towards them, which
séemed to their sight, to be in number foure
hundred horsemen, ryding and comming
towardes them in due order: after which,
they sawe the fore frunt turned, and readie
prest to fight, and the other company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
ryding a farre off, addressed in like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
which companies thus preparing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
to come togither, and standing yet
in a readinesse to fight: two black men (to
their sight) alighted from their horses, which
séemed to be Captaines: and eche appéered
valyauntly to encourage his companye to
fight: they thus boldened to fight, behelde
one the other, as readie prest, and in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18181:16"/>
after which, the two Capitaynes
againe lept on horseback. Whiles these two
companies yet stoode in a readinesse, a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous
darknesse hastily came in the place,
that it séemed farre in the night: by which
these husbandmen perceyued, (y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> this sight
of the horsemen) was none other, then a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillish
illusion, or méere falsehood of spirites.</p>
               <p>In the bownds of <hi>Polonia</hi> were séene a
marueylous company of Dogs, barcking,
and fighting togither, insomuch that manye
were torne in that broyle to péeces. After
which folowed, great warres, and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:

               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Duringia,</hi> being a bright day, there
appéered in the ayre, a bright and glittering
sworde, much like to a Fauchine or Turkie
blade: directing the point toward the South,
and the edge toward the East.</p>
               <p>And in <hi>Cleuelande,</hi> fell so great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

that the Riuer began to swell, as though it

               <p>In the yeare of our Lorde. 1557. and in

In the .xvij. daye of March, there fell
fyre from heauen: and in an other place, a
fyrie Globe was séene: it rayned also bloud,
and lumpes of bloud, vnto the bignesse of
ones hande, dropped from heauen, vnto
the sight of many: and in all the drops were
séene, like to mens faces. And on saint Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

bloudy: after which, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> French king fought a

For in the .xxj. day of August, the day

was then séene inclosed about, with a
great circle, which appéered of many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
like to the Rainebow, and continued
in like condition, for foure howers, and a
halfe, vnto the great feare, and amazement
of all such, which regarded the same sight:
for it is written, that such straunge sightes,
haue in times past béene séene, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18181:17"/>
were foreshewers of fearefull daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

which <hi>Plutarche</hi> writeth, that such a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sight foreshewed the death of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<hi>Cesar,</hi> and the great scarcitie and dearth
of all fruites of the earth, that insued the

<hi>Octauius</hi> abode at Rome, that the Sunne
was compassed with suche a cyrcle, after
which often commosions and tumults, &amp; the
lamentable harmes of lyghtnings ensued.</p>
               <p>Such a Rainebow also appéered timely
in the morning about the Sunne, in the sixt
Calendes of February, &amp; in the yere of our

               <p>In the yeare of our Lorde. 1107. a lyke
cyrcle about the Sunne was séene: after
which insued, the great dissention among
christian Princes.</p>
               <p>In the yere also of our Lord. 1157. on the

               <p>A like cyrcle to <hi>Halo</hi> appéered, before the

by which is manifest, that such sightes are
foreshewers of euils to come.</p>
               <p>In the yeare of our Lorde. 1559. with the

fyrie Globes fell out of the clowds not farre

a Citizen for the penurie of victuals came,

he had accustomed to doe: who that was a

that his Peason rather might be chaunged

that who drinketh of the same, doth dye

               <p>The other is a Well of such a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

condition, that for sixe howres the same was
found full of water, and running ouer, and
other sixe howres séene quite empty and dry:
the cause of which (as <hi>Seneca</hi> wytnesseth)
is the proportion of the vapour eleuating the

the Sea neare by.</p>
               <p>11. In the hill named <hi>Anthracius,</hi> is a

that those which came thither with a whyte

               <p>14. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> reporteth, that in

               <p>17. In the Countrie of <hi>Sclauonie,</hi> is
a Well knowne to be of such a propertie,
that clothes spreade ouer the Well (being
as some report most colde) are burned.</p>
               <p>18. In the Iland named <hi>Andro,</hi> and in
the temple of <hi>Liberi patris,</hi> is a Well of
such a propertie, that out of the same in the
Nonis of Ianuary, runneth water lyke to
Wine in taste.</p>
               <p>19. In the hill named <hi>Berosus Tauro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>

which are without remedie, and without

               <p>20. <hi>Isydore</hi> affirmeth in his .xiij. Booke,

               <p>26. It is manifest (sayth <hi>Seneca</hi>) in his

               <p>29. In the Iland named <hi>Pontus,</hi> there is

               <p>30. In <hi>Aethiopia</hi> is a Lake, in which
bodyes rubbed ouer with it, shine as they

               <p>31. Of <hi>Clitorio</hi> (being a Lake in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie)
is such a propertie knowne, that what
persons drinke of the water of the Lake,
abhorre wine after, by report.</p>
               <p>32. In <hi>Cappadocia</hi> (as reporteth <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truuius</hi>)
there is a Lake, into which, if

               <p>33. <hi>Seneca</hi> in his seauenth booke wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
that there be certaine Lakes, of such

not skilfull in swymming.</p>
               <p>34. In <hi>Syria</hi> also is there a standing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

               <p>35. The Rhene <hi>Belgas,</hi> deuideth it selfe
from the Germaines, and marueylous is
the same, which is reported to be wrytten of
this ryuer: for they affirme (of the due

ryuer then would swalowe and let them

in a certaine Epistle of <hi>Politianus,</hi> vnto
<hi>Iacobe</hi> Cardynall.</p>
               <p>36. There is a ryuer in <hi>Seythia,</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

<pb facs="tcp:18181:25"/>
as in healing al aches, the most griefes

               <p>39. In the Countrie of Burgony, there

               <p>40. There be certaine waters knowne
at this day, which haue the taste of Wine:
in that they runne by some swéete iuyce in
the earth. As by a like in <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> is
reported to be a Well of a wynie taste:
which causeth the persons drinking of the

cause of which dronkennesse is, that the

And a like to this is reported, that the ryue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>41. In the Countrie of <hi>Boëmia,</hi> is a

in the stéede of burning Wyne, or <hi>Aqua

               </p>
               <p>42. <hi>Aristotle</hi> also wryteth, that in the

which the poore people vse, in the stéede of

               <p>43. In <hi>Scythia</hi> also some report, that
there to be a bitter Well, the water of
which running into the ryuer, not farre
distaunte, causeth it to taste bitter.</p>
               <p>44. Certaine Welles and riuers there

of the earth, and other hote places: the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of which, are much pierceing and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

And such hote or bathwaters, are at

This light also is named <hi>Helena,</hi> when it
(as one Candle) is séene or appeareth alone:
which besids is reported to be the fyrebrand
and pestilence of Saylers: For as <hi>Helena</hi>
brought destruction on <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi>
euen so hath it bene obserued, that when
this light hath bene séene alone, to haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

méere illusions of spirites, as the Author
prooueth, by sundry reasons.</p>
               <p>The double light or fyre, appearing lyke
two burning Candels, named <hi>Castor</hi> and

                  <figure/>
happie iourney to the Saylers, when they
appéered togither. And these appeare after
the kinde of a fyre, cleauing to the top of the
Maste, or on the ends of the Crosse yarde.
And the people in auncient tyme thought
and accounted these for Gods, if two of them
togither, or one alone were séene, of which
like, mention is made in the last Chapiter
of the Actes of the Apostles. The foolishe
fyre, or burning Candell, is an exhalation
eleuated vnto the lowest region of the aire,
and by the heat there kindled, which whilst
<pb facs="tcp:18181:27"/>
it after séeketh to ascend vpward, it is in the
meane time depressed, through the colde of
the middle region, and appeareth as it were
skipping or dauncing, séeking then to fall to
lower places: so that of this, it appeareth
folowing on waters. In great tempestes
also, this eyther cleaueth to the Sayles, or
goeth before, or foloweth the ship.</p>
               <p>And this is not named the foolishe fyre, of
the burning onely, but for the longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing,
going before, and folowing any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

lightes, are often tymes séene to go before,
or to follow men, walking or ryding, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

the Sea, not without some terrour or feare.</p>
               <p>The foolishe fyre is ingendred of a vapour
conglutinated or compact togither in hys
partes, which then are kindled: so that not
of the clowde méeting it, but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vehement
beating or smyting togyther of the partes
in themselues. And these two <hi>Castor</hi> and
<hi>Pollux</hi> be ingendred in the lowest region of
the ayre, of a fatter fume, vnctuous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable:
which through the coldnesse of

Yet some agrée that this light, is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

that out of Marishe, and fumous places, or
out of a clammy grounde, the thick and fat
exhalation is eleuated, being soone kindled:

doth it ascende eyther more or lesse.</p>

the thicke and fatte substaunce is eleuated,
which may soone be kindled: and according

               <p>The substaunce is kindled, through the

               <p>The reason why this light or fyre, doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
beguile men, is for that men suppose the
same to go before them ryding, or walking
on foote: and that it appéereth but a Myle or
two distaunte from the walkers on foote:
which when the walkers seing, the nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the light or fyre, and directing their
iourney towardes it, not regarding their
<pb facs="tcp:18181:28"/>
                  <figure/>
proper waye, doe manye tymes, by going
out of their way, fall into dytches, waters,
or déepe pittes, to their great hazard of lyfe:
doe perswade and affirme themselues, to be
seduced and led out of their way, by the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
craft and subtiltie of the Deuill.</p>
               <p>The reason also why this light, doth both
folow, and flie from men, is through the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ayre, which by the walking or
running is forced. So that the faster the
man runneth towarde it, so much the faster
both y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same impression flie from him: but if
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18181:28"/>
he runneth from it, then doth it follow him:
in that the ayre moued, doth force the same
substaunce. An Hystoricall example of this

And by a peculiar and vayne superstition,
the people in auncient time, supposed and

of <hi>Helena</hi>: in that when the Saylers

that a more happie course and fortunate

(as they thought) of the two brethren,
which they beléeued to delyuer them from
<pb facs="tcp:18181:29"/>
perill, and hazard of perishing, and for the
same accompted them among the number
of the Gods. So that these two appearing
togither, were euermore foreshewers of a
safe and prosperous course of the ship: in
that by the comming of them, they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that other threatning impression appée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
alone (named <hi>Helena</hi>) to be driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye.
And for the same, they assigned that
power to <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi>: and named
them, the Gods of the Sea.</p>
               <p>For that impression appéering alone, is
knowne to threaten euermore daunger: in
that the exhalation as yet compact, can not
immediatly be scattered and spent, whereof
through the long tariance in sight, and thick
substaunce of burning, is the great hazarde
of perishing at hande.</p>
               <p>But the two lights or candels appéering,
doe contrariwise signifie, in that these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that the thicke substaunce to be in a
maner spent, and the tempest which began
to aryse broken and quyeted, or brought
caulme. So that after the appéeraunce of
them, no daunger at all remayneth, but a
quiet or caulme Sea rather to ensue.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the solitarie lights doe note

matter to abound in the ayre, of which the
tempests are ingendred. For when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thick

then caulmnesse of the Sea insueth. But
where the exhalation is ouermuch compact,
which immediatly is not scattered, through
the long continuance, and the grosse sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce
of burning, there doth it declare a
perillous tempest. Wherof <hi>Seneca</hi> writeth

the Sayle, the Maryners in ieopardie,

               <head>Of the flying Dragon in the ayre,
what the same is.</head>
               <p>THe flying Dragon, is when a fume kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
appéereth bended, and is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
wrythed like the belly of a Dragon: but
in the fore part for the narrownesse, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth
the figure of the neck, from
whence the sparkes are breathed or forced
<pb facs="tcp:18181:30"/>
                  <figure/>
forth with the same breathing.</p>
               <p>Or thus, the vapour on such wise kindled
expelled from a cold clowde, is in the middle
bended like the belly of a Dragon, but in the
forepart, is the vapor stretched narrow, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenteth
the figure of the neck, &amp; from it
do sparks as it were by brething issue forth.</p>
               <p>The flying Dragon is ingendred of a
vapour, not vehemently hote, drawne vp,
mightely coagulated, and pressed togither,
and placed betwéene a colde &amp; hote clowde:
Or thus, this great impression of the ayre,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18181:30"/>
is wrought and caused beneath the middle
region, when the exhalation drawne vp,
vnequall, not vehemently hote, and strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
coniealed, the two contrarie clowdes
place betwéene: the one a colde clowde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling
the vapour, as contrarie to it, from
whence the belly of the Dragon beginneth,
the other a hote clowde receyuing it, and
through the smalenesse, this expresseth the
forme of the neck, and the vttermost or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
part, nere the colde clowde, appéereth
as a taile drawne narrow togither. For the
propertie of colde, is to gather or binde hard
and narrow togyther. To conclude, the two
clowdes doe here concurre, as the hote and
cold clowde. For that cause, the exhalation
placed in the middle, inclyneth it selfe vnto
the hote clowde for the plentie of fyre, and
doth in the middle concurre, and is there
bended. For the beginning and ende, are
néere matched or ioyned to the cold clowde.
So that it séemeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning to breath
smoke forth, through the nighnesse of the
moyst clowde. The first part séemeth the
grosser or bigger, in that the same is newe
kindled, but the furthest part or ende ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
the straighter or smaller, in that the
same is nighe to the quenching out, through
<pb facs="tcp:18181:31"/>
which is this bended.</p>
               <p>And the reason why, at the vanishing of
the Dragon, a smoke is scattered abrode:
is for that the hote and burning clowde, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the colde, procureth a smoke, as the
like appéereth in gréene woode burning: or
for that the matter scattered, through the
colde clowde smoketh. Of the Dragon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
of the wicked, which they vse in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
maners, to purchase them vnlawfull

no reason, as that the same is prepared and
made of a vapour and exhalation. For well
knowne it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their Dragon to be wrought
by the pollicie of Deuils, and inchantments
of the wicked, as sundrie examples lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,

the like, in the yere. 1532. in manye Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
were Dragons crowned, séene flying

Swines snowtes: &amp; sometimes were there

               <p>THe cause why any beast, at the South
winde blowing, lesser hungereth: is for
that the heate then openeth the powers of
the skinne, that the inner hote spirite maye
breath forth and be dissolued. Whereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion
and naturall strength is caused the
weaker, and by it bodies filled with a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
earthly moysture. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause why
the Southwinde, is woont to be vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the night time, than in the daye: is
for that the exhalation of thys wynde is so
hote, that through the coldnesse of the night,
it can not be depressed. So that by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
heate drawne vp, it ryseth and rageth
the vehementer. But in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day time through
the Sunnes heate thinned, and sometimes
spent: whereof with such a force, as in the
night it can not blowe. The Haruest and
Spring, are the aptest tymes of the yeare
for the wyndes, seing in those partes of the
yeare, manye exhalations are drawne vp,
which when of the Sunne beames they can
not be spent, through his absence, they then
gyue matter to the winds. But in the Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18181:39"/>
and Winter, doe the windes lesser
blow: For in the Sommer time, the exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
are burned by the Sunnes heate,
and in the Winter tyme, the powers of the
earth, are shut so close or hard togither, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
the intensed colde, that no matter can
breath forth. And this worthie to be noted
and marueyled at, that at the blowing of
the North winde, Welles and deepe pittes
of water, sende vp more fumes, then at the
blowing of the South winde. The cause
why the Northerly windes and Southerly
doe oftner blowe, but the Easterly and
Westerly sildomer: is for that the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
drawne vp by the Sunne, and flying
the heate of the Sunne, fall vnto the sides.
Or otherwise, that in these places they
finde a space, and are not consumed or spent
by the heate of the Sunne, which is caused
in the East and Weast, which places the
Sunne occupyeth twise in the daye, and
consumeth there the vapours. After when
the Sunne departeth into the Northerly
signes, he is then higher, than that he can
let or hinder the ascending of the exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But when he departeth into the
Southerly signes, through his néerenesse
<pb facs="tcp:18181:40"/>
vnto the earth, the beames then stretch
thwarte, and through this thwartnesse,
they be so weake, that they can not waste
or spende the exhalations. The cause why
the windes at the beginning arise softer,
and blow weaker, is for that (as we haue
afore taught) of the causes of the thwarte
course of the windes. <hi>Aristotle</hi> vttereth
the cause, of the circulare motion of the
ayre. For the ayre togither with the swift
motion of heauen, is drawen about. So
that it is manifest, that all thinges to bée
moued togither, which be in it. Seing the
exhalation is hote and dry, and through his
lightnesse drawne vpwarde, and by the
cold of the middle region (so letting) depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
it can not of this, discende downe right.
For thys through his lightnesse, alwayes
ascendeth. And caried by a thwart maner,
that it can not of the same, descende downe
right. For which cause, it must néedes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
that the winds are caried by a thwart
course. The cause of the vehemencie of the
windes, is that the breath or winde forced,
through the fortitude of the colde, sendeth
forth the exhalation. For how mightier the
same depresseth the exhalation ascending,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18181:40"/>
so much the stronger doth the same mooue
forewarde the ayre. The windes also are
caused the vehementer, through the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the exhalation ascending, which
with the same descending, is matched or
ioyned. For on such wise, the strengthes
are increased: and of the same, it muste
néedes force the ayre the mightier. The
cause why in the great heate, and extreme
colde, little winde bloweth: is for that in
the same Sea soone the exhalation (the foode
of the winds) is then spent by the Sunne:
but in this the earth shut with the colde,
can not then breath forth fumes. Or play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to wryte, the intensed or mightie heate
of the Summer, burneth and wasteth the
vapour or exhalation drawne vp, before it
may giue or yéelde, matter for the windes.
And in the time of the cold winter, through
the contrarie cause: the windes lesse blow.
For the extreame colde of the winter, shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the poores of the earth, that nothing
can then breath forth: the cause that winds
cease after showers of raine, is for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the raine, the powers of the earth are
opened, out of which, the matter of the
windes issueth, which of the raine, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb facs="tcp:18181:41"/>
of the more aboundaunt showers, are
then shut togither &amp; stopped, that nothing
may more breath forth, wherof the winde
must néedes cease. The cause that after the
blowing of the North winde, the other
windes ceasse: is for that the same winde
is colde and drye, which then shutteth the
powers of the earth, and letteth the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
forth, except in the spring tyme. For
in the same time, through the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Sunne comming then vnto
vs, the earth opening it selfe, subdueth the
matter for the more part, with the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
winds. And why the windes be oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
colde, is for that the windes, although
they be ingendred and procéede of a hote
and drie vapour: yet doe they breath colde.
The same hapneth or is caused through the
farre motion of the ayre, by colde places:
euen as by the mouth, the winde or hote
breath, farre of moued or extended, cooleth.
Why the West winde blowing, the Dogs
then euill hunt: is for that it especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth
the ayre, and of all the windes
it is the most contynuall or longest lasting,
and toucheth especially the earth.</p>

               </p>
               <p>15. Windes are wont to blowe for the

But at noone, for the greater heate of the
Sunne, the winds then cease. And lyke at

               <p>21. When the North wynde blowing,
moueth many clowds, signifieth a drought
to folow, or great heate.</p>
               <p>22. The Easterly windes be drie, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the combustion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vapours wrought

               <p>23. The Westerly windes doe moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,

               <p>24. Raine hastily comming, is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
by a great clowde, arysing from
that part of the worlde, from which the
windes arise or come. And howe much the

               <p>25. The South winde when it bloweth

great tempest, especially on the Sea.</p>
               <p>26. Lightnings with a Northerly wind,

               <p>28. A Northerly yeare (after the minde

then a Southerly.</p>
               <p>29. It is good and profitable, to take a

that the refraction may be caused the better,
and this regulare also, that it may the more
giue and shewe an vniforme ymage of the
sunne. And waterie, that the Sunne may
the commodiouser be represented, euen as
the like is caused in water. So that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clowde
prudently is placed on the one side, and not
vnder the Sunne, nor right against: for if
right against, then woulde the same be a
Rainebow: if vnder the sunne, then would
<hi>Halo</hi> be caused. And this for the more part
is caused, in the East or West, through the
disposition of the clowde.</p>
               <p>The formall cause, is the refraction of the
sunne beames in the clowde, being at the
one side, which altogyther as a Glasse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth
the sunnes beame, and the colour
which then is in the sunne, it causeth euen
the like to appéere, as when of a light ayre,
through his thicknesse, the sight is broken.
For the beames falling vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same clowde
thus fashioned, and of the same broken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the sight, especiallye in that clowde not
being ouer thicke, thinne or blacke, doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:18181:46"/>
To conclude, when a dewie clowde, or
vapourous, is in anye part pierced, then
are the Sunne beames gathered in that
hole, and by the refraction shed vnto the
sight: so that such a brightnesse appéereth,
as if the sunne it selfe where séene. For thys
<hi>Parelius</hi> is, as the ymage of the sunne, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in a great looking Glasse. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
it is, that manye sunnes sometimes are
sayde to appeare togither, as two or thrée.
So that the first is the figure of the sunne it
selfe; the second and third consisteth through
the breaking of the sunne beames, in the
clowde placed on the one side: by which,
thrée sunnes or more, are oftentimes séene.

of the exhalation vnto the sides of the

booke, of naturall questions, thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineth
thunder: it is a spirite or breath (sayth
he) running in the clowdes that causeth the
thunder: and after it hath contended wyth
the resistant matter brasteth out, which in
that running awaye kindleth the fyre. And
the variety of the noyses or rumbling of the

clowdes be vnequall, and that they haue as
it were certayne hollow places, and are no

               <p>THe thunder is, after two maner or
wayes: For the thunder is eyther vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or great: or else weake or small.</p>
               <p>The thunder weake or small, is when an
exhalation runneth forth in the clowde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and
is driuen from side to side without rupture
and breaking of the clowde. And this is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thrée wayes, as crashing, whistling, and
blowing.</p>
               <p>1. The same crashing, or making a noyse
like to the rubbing of a coarde, is caused
<pb facs="tcp:18181:51"/>
through the smyting of clowds, which euen
then are chaunged into water: and it is like
to the noyse, which is heard, in the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a hote burning yron in colde water.</p>
               <p>2. The same whistling is, when the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation
is not yet kindled, nor forted forth,
and that the clowdes in thicknesse are not a
like equall: so that in diuers partes of them,
especially in the thinner, doth the exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
brast forth. Of which, this whisteling
thunder is the like noyse, as is of the winds
blowing stronglye through narrow holes:
where the vapour not yet forced forwarde
by dyuers partes of the clowde, breaketh in
the ende through the thinner.</p>
               <p>3. The blowing thunder is, when the
clowde is so weake, that it can not keepe the
exhalation kindled. So that before the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
is kindled, the same issueth forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
anye vehement noyse, euen lyke the
noyse that the Smithes Bellowes cause or
make.</p>
               <p>The vehement or great thunder is, when
the exhalation strongly and vehemently cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
or breaketh the clowde, through which
a fearefull noyse is caused, euen like to the
tearing of a broade cloth. And this is, fower
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18181:51"/>
maner of wayes: as eyther it is rumbling,
eyther breaking or tearing a sunder, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
violent, or cracking.</p>
               <p>1. The same rumbling or making a hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous
noyse is, when the vapour or exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shaketh the clowde with a certain rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
but medleth not togither. The thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
also is a sounding which maketh a noise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
lyke to the humming of many men talking
in a Cloyster or such like vaulted place: as
when the vapour doth so much smite the
sides of the clowde, but not cleaueth, and
that flame then appeareth, as it were tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
a clothe torne a sunder.</p>
               <p>2. The thunder cutting is the same,
which first smiteth it, but after cutteth out
the clowde, which noyse immediatly shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the thwart lightning brasting forth.
The violent thunder is the same, which by
one inforcement cleaueth the clowde.</p>
               <p>3. The thunder cracking or shaking is,
when the exhalation kindled, deuydeth the
clowde, of which certayne partes issue.
This kinde of thunder maketh the lyke
noyse, as the cracking of wet woode, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the fyre. For it is a vapour kindled
and dry, which in the issuing breaketh a sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:18181:52"/>
the clowde, euen like as air Egge layed
on coales that brasteth.</p>
               <p>The efficient cause of the thunder, is the
sunne working with the other hote starres,
as the Astrologians report. For when the
Sunne, <hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mercurie,</hi> are
placed in hote signes, and fete places, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when <hi>Iupiter</hi> is ioyned to <hi>Mars,</hi> by
any condition of beames, are woont to cause
thunder, and to prepare the matter of them.</p>
               <p>The matter of the thunder is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde
vapour, or an exhalation very hote
and drie, conioyned with a moyst vapour.
This matter is drawne up by the heate of
the sunne, vnto the middle region of the
ayre, where it chaungeth into a moyste
clowde, or is togyther eleuated wyth a
moyst vapour, as affirmeth <hi>Aristotle,</hi> by

               <p>THe clowde in the thunder being whyte,
is little or nothing to be feared. For it
signifieth the exhalation to be weake, and
the great abundance of vapours.</p>
               <p>2 The clowde in the thunder being very
blacke, pressing the vapour strongly togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through his thicknesse, sendeth a noyse
lightly forth very feareful: especially when
the inner fume copious and thicker, can not
be broken or deuided a sunder, wythout a
great inforcement.</p>
               <p>3. The clowde from black waxing red,
or being red, procureth a mightier cracke
and noyse, than the black clowde. For thys
is verie thick, and hath or contayneth much
of the fyrie vapour.</p>
               <p>4. The clowde with a blackish rednesse
waxing gréene, or appearing gréene, is the
most perillous of all, and verie much to be

feared, if the same consisteth or abydeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly

for the rednesse, hath many fyrie vapours:
For the blacknesse, an aboundant vapour
thickned togither: For the gréenenesse, the

mightie and fearefull rumbling, is to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

               <head>Of that lightning named Fulgur
what the same is, and of
the others.</head>
               <p>IT is an exhalation kindled through the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
agitation, like to towe, by which the
matter séeketh issue, which yet to the earth
falleth not: or the same is, when the onely
fyre sheweth: So that the same is caused,
when the clowde is thinne, and yéeldeth to
the breaking forth of the fyre without noyse.
The lyke is that named <hi>Fulgetrum,</hi> sauing
that it sheweth weaker, and of lesser light:
although many name the <hi>Fulgetrum,</hi> to be
the often repeatings togither of the fyre,
which the lyke are vsuall in Haruest. That
flashing much lyke a glistring light, is the
same which out of the kindled exhalation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryseth,
which by the sides of the clowde is
forced and driuen forth. Or it is the sodaine
appearance through time, of the subtill va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
and kindled, running along by the
ayre, which is discerned, before the thunder
be heard: and no marueyle, in that the light
is farre swifter than the noyse, and the sight
alwayes goeth before the hearing, as by a
like in the cutting of timber: yet after na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18181:57"/>
is the light the later. For the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hote and drie, is caried into the middle
region of the ayre, and before it higher as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendeth,
of the vapour togither eleuated,
and forced into a thick clowde, is the same
compassed and included: and when it can
delate it selfe no more, through the wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and colde clowde, it then wandreth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the whole clowde, and séeketh issue
forth, which when it findeth not, as disday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
breaketh then the clowde, through
which violent breaking forth, is that noyse
caused, which we name the thunder: and
togither with that motion, in which it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by the clowde, and claue the clowde, is
the same kindled: and when this sparseth
the flame as it were abroad in the ayre, then
is it named <hi>Fulgur.</hi> The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
the thunder and broade lightning is,
that the thunder is the selfe same noyse in
the ayre, which the vapour causeth running
in the clowde, and séeking issue forth: But
the broade lightning is the selfe same fyerie
brightnesse, which aryseth of the vapour is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
and kindled. For when it contended
through the resistaunce, and brake forth,
that flying away kindled the fyre. The fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
<pb facs="tcp:18181:58"/>
lightning properly is none other, than
a brightnesse of the exhalation kindled, and
breaking forth of the clowde, which shyneth
abroade in the ayre. But that named <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getrum,</hi>
is a lesser lightning, and darcker
flame in the aire. So that the same is named
<hi>Fulmen</hi> or the perillousser lightning, when
the whole exhalation kindled is sent downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde.
But that weaker lightning named
<hi>Fulgur,</hi> is when the brightnesse onely of
that exhalation kindled, shyneth in the aire.
Thus <hi>Seneca</hi> reporteth, in the first booke of
naturall questions. That the clowdes
meanely smyting togyther, cause the weake
lightnings: but the clowdes smyting togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by a greater force, cause the violent
lightnings. The diuersitie of colours in the
lightning, procéedeth of the diuersitie of
matter, in that one whiles whyte and cléere,
an other whyles yealow and darke, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whiles red, and fumous or darke it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth:
euen as the dyuers colours, that
are discerned in the clowdes. The whyte
and cléere lightning, procéedeth of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
and thinne vapour: or of a thinne exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
in a clowde ouer waterie, whereof
it sustaineth not a vehement heate and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18181:58"/>
Hereof the bodyes, which this tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
doth it little or nothing burne, so that
more by beame, than by the fyre, doth it
harme. This sometymes is profitable to
fruites, and a little to the leaues of Trées,
if it hapneth in an apt place, and time. The
darcke yealow lightning, procéedeth of a
thinne and somewhat clammye fume, in
which the flame is shyning, and portendeth
a vehement heate and perillous fyre, if the
same especially be sent downewarde. The
red lightning is caused, through a thicke
clowde, and the exhalation well fermented
or mixed togither, which brasteth forth with
a terrible noyse in the swelling ayre. The
grosser vapour of this hardly kindled, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth
a verie daungerous flame, which
euen through the middle of the raine forceth
and worketh his fearefull properties. This
lightning many times, setteth cities on fire,
and burneth euen into the earth, water not
preuayling or able to resist it (such is the
mightie force of this celestiall fyre) that so
violently and grieuously destroyeth. The
fumous and somewhat black lightning, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedeth
of a verie earthly and obscure, yet a
matter mightily burning, whose clowde, in
<pb facs="tcp:18181:59"/>
that it containeth very much of the viscous
moysture, is woont to fabricate or forme a
black or yronnie stone, which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shot sent
forth, burneth hastilye mightie bodyes of
trées, and sundrie other most solide matters,
without shewe or signe left behinde: yea,
these and other matters this cleaueth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth,
and vtterly wasteth. The light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
in the night, are playner and more
apparant, then in the day time, through the
Sunnes presence, by whose beames and
light aboue the earth, euen great lightnings
are hidden in the ayre to be séene. Here note,
that many persons are often made blynde,
or euer after molested with a dimnesse of
sight, which doe looke but with winking eies
on the lightnings: much more daungerous
thought, to looke on it with open eyes. The
fishes, and any maner cattle, smitten with
the mightier lightning, is daungerous to
eate, in that the fleshe and meate of such
are infected with a venimous qualitye, as
by triall hath bene obserued.</p>

THis that the Phisitions properly name
lightning, is a common name, which is
referred and applied vnto euery exhalation,
which burning brasteth forth of the clowds.
So that the lightning is referred vnto the
same exhalation, which thickned and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
rounde in the middle of the clowde, smy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
or beateth the clowde by a longer space,
and through the motion kindled, it at the
last cleaueth &amp; breaketh through the clowde,
and is sent violently to the earth. For the
fyre forced of the clowde, is cast to the
earth: euen as the motion caused, in the
burning of gréene wood. For that cause is
this rightly named lightning, when the fire
sent forth of the clowdes, is caried euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the earth, and eyther doth it burne, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
breake, or hurt somewhat on the earth.
The flashing light, and the lightning, doe
not differ in the substance, but rather in the
forme and maner: for the flashing light is a
fyre lightlier kindled, which sparsed vnder
the clowdes, higher shyneth in the aire. But
the lightning is that exhalation, which when
the same is sent forth of the clowde, falleth
to the earth. The engendring of the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
thus appeareth: that when the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
<pb facs="tcp:18181:60"/>
driuen or moued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clowde is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and brasteth out of the moyst clowde,
then moystened agayne and gathered togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as it were into a certain Masse, which
stirred and moued agayne is so hardened,
euen as clay dryed and hardned by the heate
of fyre. This Masse on thys wise baked and
hardned, is named the lightning. So that
the same is ingendred of a thicke vapour,
dry and viscouse, which is gathered rounde
togyther of the colde vapours, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
forth by great force and noyse, and
discending euen to the earth, cleaueth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthroweth,
windeth about, scattereth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
manye partes, yea destroyeth and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by diuers meanes, bodyes there found
hard and solyde, through the motion, light,
and blast. Howe many kindes of lightning
there are, can hardly be vttered, in that the
nature of the lightning is so dyuers and
marueylous, through which a sufficient
reason of the same can scarcely be giuen.
Yet marueylous are the workes of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
if a man well consider them: and
nothing to be doubted at, but that a secret
and diuine power consisteth in them. Also
certaine it is, that the lightnings not to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18181:60"/>
procéede or come by hap, nor onely caused
through the motion of the matter, in that
these sometimes are caused and sent downe
by the almightie God gouerning, nor such
can be applyed vnto natural causes, in that
they often foreshew some euill, and cal men
to repentaunce. Yet is their studie to be
commended, which (after the possibilitie of
mans nature) haue diligently sought out,
the causes of these matters. To be briefe,
<hi>Aristotle, Plynie, Seneca,</hi> and others, doe
make thrée differences of lightnings, and
these, according to the diuersitie of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and effect, vnto which al the other kinds
may be referred and reduced. For the one
kinde is cutting a sunder, an other making
swartishe, and the thirde burning: or there
is one astonishing or causing stiffe, an other
blacke burning or fumous, and an other
cléere or flaming.</p>
               <p>1. The lightnings cutting, are those:
which doe not burne, but doe pierce and
part in sunder things resisting, through the
qualitie of the matter, of which consist, the
great drowte and plentie of windes and
spirites, which they violently take wyth
them. For these breake and part into small
<pb facs="tcp:18181:61"/>
péeces the obiect matter, before that it can
be burned of the lightning. In that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour
is swifter then the lightning. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is the same named astonishing, not
burning, but pierceing and parting into
small péeces. For such is the purenesse and
thinnesse of the flame, that it maye pierce
through most straight places, and for the
mightie sturdinesse of the matter, maye
especially part into peeces. For the spirite or
drie vapour is carted forth of the clowde,
with a most swift motion, and thus entred
into bodies full of poores and penetrable, it
parteth them in péeces. So that this kinde
of lyghtning, is named the astonishing
lightning, throughe the colde expelled by
heat: for that it consisteth of the mightiest
vertues, and is of a marueylous nature,
and by a most swifte motion also doth the
spirite or drie vapour consume all thinges.
This burneth man inwarde, and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
the bodie to ashes, without harming
the garments, it slayeth the yongling in the
wombe, without harme to the mother, it
consumeth money, the purses remayning
whole, it melteth the sworde the sheath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whole, it harmeth the hande the gloue
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18181:61"/>
not perished, and the vessell broken, it so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonisheth
the wine, that for thrée dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the wine sheddeth or runneth not forth.
For the matter of this lightning, is verie
subtill, and lightly pierceing the thing stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
so that it burneth those matters which
resist it, as stones, yron, and such like. Here
note an example, of one <hi>Martia</hi> an honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
woman of Rome, who being with child,
had the yongling striken and kylled of the
lightning in hir wombe, and she abode with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
harme: and if the hystories be true, she
escaped after without harme. <hi>Eutropius</hi>
reporteth, that a marueylous kinde of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
hapned on the birth day of <hi>Cicero,</hi>
which was on this wise: a certayne May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of Rome iourneying into <hi>Apulia,</hi> was
smitten by the way with the stroke of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
all the garments shifted from hir bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
without cutting a sunder, and both the
Tyre and knittings on the breast, legges,
and féete consumed, the Bracelets, Kings,
and other ornamentes molten, so that shée
lay naked on the grounde, the body not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
And the horse with the same slayne, lay
bare, hauing neyther brydle, saddle, nor no
furnyture on hym. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18181:62"/>
2. The lightning making swartishe, is
the same which burneth not, but for the pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cytie
and thinnesse of matter onely maketh
swartishe or darke browne the resistaunt
matters, euen like the smoked partes cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
of fyre, that can not burne. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is the same named blackishe to smoke:
in that all thinges which this smyteth both
wythin and without, it maketh blackishe,
euen like soote of a small time made, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
behinde a shew &amp; note of a fyrie smoke,
and for the ouermuch subtilnesse and thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
it flyeth out and pierceth, before that
it can burne the resistaunt matter. As may
euidently appéere by the vines, trées, corne,
and herbes, blasted with this lightning.</p>
               <p>3. The lightning burning, is the same
which hauing much of the earthly matter,
when it is sent downe, striketh and entreth
into the thinner bodyes, and smyting into
solyde bodyes forthwith dissolueth, destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and wasteth, whose force for troth is to
be marueyled at. Otherwise is the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to be cléere and flaming. This light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is diuersly caused: For the matter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
of the lightning, hath verie much
of the earthly and viscous matter. For
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18181:62"/>
which cause it burneth the resistaunt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
especially if of the same substaunce,
which may be burned, they consist, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printeth
or sheweth the notes of burning:
yet the matter sometimes of the lightning,
consisteth of the vapours, verie subtill and
impure. Hereof the bodyes thinne and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
poores, this entereth without any note
or shewe of hurte, and corrupteth the inner
members: and the solyde bodyes resisting,
doth it part into péeces, &amp; consumeth them.
So that this slayeth a man, or anye lyuing
beast, wythout any wounde appearing, or
note of hurt. And this also melteth the golde
or siluer in mens purses, the purses remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vnperished. <hi>Albertus magnus</hi> apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
vnto the lightnings of this kinde, the
depriuing of sight, and the swelling of the
face. For so much as we often sée men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the lightnings become blynde: yea
and the face by that meanes so swollen, that
a man can hardly knowe after the person.
The same is caused through the thinnesse,
and porositie of our skinne and eyes, which
lightly receiue the subtil vapour, so that this
corrupteth the radicall moysture of the face,
and swelleth the face, and dryeth also the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall
<pb facs="tcp:18181:63"/>
moysture of the eyes, through which
dryed, blindnesse of necessitie must insue.</p>
               <p>In what time of the yere, the lightnings
oftner happen, is here vttered: For the
sightnings in Winter sildome appeare to
vs, and the reason (as <hi>Plynie</hi> reporteth) is
in that the materiall cause is not so copious,
as in other times the same is woont to be:
for in the Winter tyme the exhalation is
onely moyst and colde, which gathered into
the clowdes, receyueth a verie hote force,

lightnings are oftner caused, in that the
heate of sommer is not so great, that it can
consume all the matter or substaunce of the
clowdes. Euen so in the meane seasons of
the yere, as in the spring time, and haruest,
lightnings are oftner caused: in that the
constitution of these seasons, ministreth to
the ayre much matter, as wel dry, as moyst.</p>
               <p>The cause why man or beast is so slayne,
that no token of the hurt or wounde appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:
is for that the force and subtilnesse of
the kindled vapour, by which at a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
pierceth through the skinne, and penetrable
fleshe, through out porouse, and blasteth the
vitall members with a pestilent poyson, and
wyth the venymous qualitie and vertue
(which all lightnings are named to haue) it
slayeth. The same may verie well be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto the foote hurt, and the shooe not peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
and to the sap of trées corrupted, the
trée remayning whole, without any corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the woode.</p>
               <p>The cause why money is so molten with
the lightning, the purse or money bagge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning
whole, and the sworde in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
the sheath abyding vnperished: is for
that these bodies are porouse, which lightly
<pb facs="tcp:18181:64"/>
yéelde to the mighty spirite, and subtill light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vapour, in which if such a mighty force
of striking be, through the great violence,
it then parteth into small péeces the resis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunt
and harde bodyes: if such a force of
burning, it then melteth. Such is the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of this, that it throweth downe pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles
of stone, yea Towers most strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
wrought, and other buyldings, mightie
stones also it parteth in péeces, &amp; such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which haue anye resistaunce and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
in them, this ouerthroweth.</p>
               <p>The cause why lightnings often smyte
most highe places, as stéeples, towers, and
among trées, the high Oke in especiall, and
highe Mountaynes: is for that such which
be the higher, are the more open to iniuries
of the clowdes in the ayre, and by the course
running here and there, these bodies in the
waye resisting, happen to be striken and
spoyled. And euerye agent mightier wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
néere hand, then that which by a great
space is distaunt. The other cause deuine is,
in that euill spirits dwelling in the ayre, doe
often stirre vp and cause (through Gods suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraunce)
cruell tempestes, and spoyle lyke
places, by Gods due vengeaunce.</p>

                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:18181:64"/>
The cause why nettes lying in the water,
may be burned of the lightning: is for that
the flame of the same, hath much of the
Brimstonie and viscous matter, so that
fallen into water it may burne, the same ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
attayned the due matter. And the same
doe our Artificers proue in Gunpowder, of
which the whole Arte insueth the celestiall
lightnings. And the lyke in a maner, may
a man sée in lyme, which through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vpon of water, waxeth hote and is
kindled.</p>
               <p>The cause why the lightning cutteth or
parteth a vessell in péeces, or is burnt with
the lightning, the Wyne remayning whole
togither for a certaine space, as if the same
were coagulated: is through the lightning,
which hath verye much of the Brimstonie
substance and viscositie in it, which by pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
into the whole substance of the Wine
is sparsed: hereof through the heate, what
soeuer is fast holding, is forced and sent into
the furthest extending of the Wine, &amp; both
dryed and boyled agayne, through the fyrie
spirite of the lightning, that worketh a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
skinne, which stayeth the Wine from
running forth, for a certaine time, and the
<pb facs="tcp:18181:65"/>
same as it were with a skinne compassed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

This exhalation aswell flashing forth of
the clowdes, as the lightning, consisting for
the more part in a gréene or black clowde
bigge swollen, with a certayne clammye
matter, gathered rounde through the colde
moysture shed about of the clowde, and a
most sharpe heate folowing, procured of the
Sunne and starres, also through the motion

a solyde and stonie bodye, in the lyke order

Also a venymous beast striken with the

that no person to be touched, which eyther
afore shall sée the lightning, or heare the

               <p>3. When a beast waking is striken with

shut, but striken sléeping, hath the eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen:
and lying on the ground, is turned by
it of the other side.</p>
               <p>4. The lightning consumeth the sword
or meate knife in the sheath, without harme
of the sheath. It melteth the money in the
purse, as afore vttred: it perisheth the foote,
without harme of the shooe. In that it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth
<pb facs="tcp:18181:67"/>
the same, being full of poores, without
resistaunce: but about solyde and resisting
bodyes, it longer stayeth in consuming
them. It sometimes like hurteth the bones,
without spot appearing on the fleshe, in that
through the weake resistaunce and spéedie
pierceing of the fyre, the fleshe is not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of it: as maye appeare of the hande,
spéedily thrust in and handling the burning
flame.</p>
               <p>5. The lightning sometimes parteth a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sunder
trées, as if those were clouen with a
wedge, without burning, and sometimes
staineth and blacketh by the touching, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
burning, and sometimes burneth both
houses and barnes: the cause of the first, is
the vehemencie of the stroke: the cause of
the second is the thinnesse, and weakenesse
of the exhalation: the cause of the thirde, is
the thicknesse of the matter of the exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for that the fyre in the substaunce more
thick, doth stronger burne: euen as it may
appéere in the yron red hote: but in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

may appeare in the Towe.</p>
               <p>6. The lightning poysoneth beasts stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
euen like the bit of a Serpent, and mad
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18181:67"/>
Dogge: in that the matter of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
is Brimstonie and venimous.</p>
               <p>7. The same is to be marueyled at,
which <hi>Seneca</hi> reporteth, as that wine ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
to be burned with the lightning (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vttered) the wine remayning whole,
and not shedding: the wine the whiles, not
contayned in any bodye. Also the lightning
doth so intoxicate the Wine striken, that
the drinkers of it eyther die, or become fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
and madde.</p>
               <p>The same is caused, through the infectiue
nature of the lightning: and the reason of
the astonishing of the Wine, is the hastie
alteration, by which the whole clammy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Wine, is drawne forth into the
outward vpper face, where, like a thin skin
about retayneth the Wine, that the same
shed or runne not abroade, for thrée dayes.</p>
               <p>8. The lightning striking a person slée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
doth open the eyes of the sléeper: but
of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> person then waking or awake, it shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the eyes. The cause of which is, in that
the lightning causeth the sléeper to awake,
but the person awake, it astonisheth in such
maner, that he shall sooner dye, then that
he can open the eyes againe for the tyme, as
<pb facs="tcp:18181:68"/>
the auncient report.</p>
               <p>9. The person stricken and touched with
the lightning, doth after turne the head and
face towarde the stroke, from whence the
lightning came. The cause of this, doth
<hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> here shewe: in that the
force of the stroke comming, conuerteth or
tourneth the striken bodyes towarde the
stroke, and naturall is the same to euerye
creature, to turne it selfe toward the harme
sodaynely comming, in holding the face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
it.</p>
               <p>10. The lightning sometimes harmeth
the yongling in the mothers wombe, the
mother remayning vnharmed: the cause of
which is the tendernesse of the yongling, and
strength of the mother: as by a lyke exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
afore vttered, of the noble woman <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
of Rome.</p>
               <p>11. A dead Serpent stricken wyth light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
becommeth full of wormes, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
hapneth not to it aliue. The cause
is, in that through the lightning it is purged
of the proper poyson, which also is of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature, than the lightning, so that the
same then hindereth not the procreation of
wormes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:18181:68"/>
12. The lightning sometymes burneth
and consumeth the garments on the bodye,
yea the shooes on the féete, manye tymes it
onely burneth the heares on the head, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
harme of the body, which is caused tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the weakenesse of the exhalation: But
this sometymes killeth a man, without any
hurt or marke appearing, or anye signe of
burning. The same caused through the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilnesse
of the exhalation, which if the same
shall be grosse, leaueth a note of the burning.</p>
               <p>13. Such which long looke vp at the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and hold their faces against the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
are eyther caused blynde, or swollen
in the face, or procured leprous. The same
hapneth thorowe the fyre receyued by the
poores of the countenaunce and eyes, which
like swelleth the face, and dryeth vp the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staline
humour, that is cause of the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>14. The places of such which are stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and burnt with the lightnings, are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
colder than the other partes of the body:
eyther for that the greater heate, draweth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

quite in those places, by report.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18181:69"/>
15. Such bodyes striken with the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
haue or possesse after a Brimstonie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour:
in that the matter of the lightning is
Brimstonie, as the Philosopher <hi>Niphus</hi>
reporteth.</p>
               <p>16. This <hi>Niphus</hi> vttreth that the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
spéedier burneth solyde and harde bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,
than the soft: as the same of skill
knowne, and many tymes obserued.</p>
               <p>17. The thunderbolt sent forth with the

               <p>18. In the yeare. 1553. in the Month of

whyle the people before din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

which yet through the goodnesse of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie

and iudged of the lightnings: which if
those came from the left part or side of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and returned into the same agayne,
they pronounced those to be happy and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous.
For on such wise <hi>Anchyses</hi> (after
the Romayne maner) prognosticated good
luck, if the lightning hapned on the left side.
And <hi>Cicero</hi> in his second booke <hi>de Diuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi>
reporteth the same to be good luck in
al matters traueyled about, if the lightning
shall happen on the left side. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gréekes
and Barbarians, iudged the lightninges
prosperous, that came on the right side. The
Baye trée is sildome harmed with the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
which rather of practise, than by
reason alowed: for so much as it hath thys
repulsiue vertue of the lightning through

at this day, séemeth a maruell to fewe of
any knowledge. For the same is sufficiently
<pb facs="tcp:18181:73"/>
knowne, that it is caused by accidence. Yet
further, the true cause of the earthquake or
trembling of the earth, is the winde or drie
vapour, grosse and earthly, included of
the earth, and otherwise sent in, or there
ingendred: so that manifest it is that such
spirites or winde to be ingendred in the
earth. For well knowne is this, that the
earth of it selfe is drye, but the same moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
with daylie showers of rayne, and
the poores shut harde togither, that the exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
ingendred or conceyued brasteth not
forth: and salt or sea waters cause the like,
in that these through the saltnesse close or
shut the poores of the earth, with which the
same is on euerye side compassed, and in a
maner swimmeth or runneth ouer it: and
after with the beames of the sunne heating,
doth ingender a great aboundance of exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
which not so much breaketh vp into
the ayre, but that within it selfe often retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
drye spirites or vapours, both grosse
and earthly, which cause the Earthquake.
This sentence of <hi>Plynie</hi> of the materiall
cause, doe the Philosophers affirme and
prooue, that the same through the gathering
of the spirites is ingendred, and <hi>Aristotle</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:18181:73"/>
in these coniectures, proueth by a lyke rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that the Earthquake may so be caused.</p>
               <p>The first reason is taken of mans body,
in which windy spirites, when in it they are
included, are woont to cause a trembling or
shaking, where the venting forth could not
be caused.</p>
               <p>A second reason he gathereth and taketh
of the condition of a quyet or caulme ayre
and season, when as the tyme is cléere, and
a great stilnesse in the night, and at Noone.
Here or at that time, the spirites included in
the earth, can not breath forth.</p>
               <p>A thirde reason, through the plentye of
matter, which caused greater in the spring
and haruest, than in the other quarters or
partes of the yere. Of which, in those tymes
for the more part, are Earthquakes caused.</p>
               <p>A fourth reason he vttreth of experience,
for so much as the same by vse is found, that
the agitation not to cease, vntill the whole
force of spirites shall haue breathed forth.</p>
               <p>The fift and last of the precedent sounde:
for the earth causeth a roring or sounde, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
the windie spirite met: before the
same be smytten &amp; resisted. The selfe same
confirmeth the reason of the tyme, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb facs="tcp:18181:74"/>
For these are caused a little before the
Sunne rysing, at what tyme the windes
are woont for the more part to arise. In the
Equinoctials also, when the greater force
of vapours consisteth, than in the Solstices,
and through the straight or narrow places,
of the Sea, in which straight places, the
winde is included: is wont there to be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter,

               <head>What the formall cause is.</head>
               <p>THe formall cause, is the agitation and
smyting of the earth: for the drie va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
and windes there included by hys
vertue, are lifted or forced vp, séeking issue
forth, but when this is no where open, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
the passages of the earth stopped, are
driuen and sent back warde, with no meane
force, through which stryuing the earth in

ouermuch heate or colde, is the issue of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
procured, of which the smyting is
caused. A sure &amp; an euident note of this, are
the windes in mans bodye included. For
those shake euen the whole body, when by

the Hystories: yea great waters and ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
drunke vp, and the course of waters
chaunged, and lande floodes caused in the

in it selfe a much exhalation, which it
heating conceaueth, through the fierie effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
and vertue of the Sunne, the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
and fixed starres. This spirite, for that
the same is subtill, is most apt to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
So that when by it this drie spirite run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
included within the earth, séeking is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
is so by his force lifted vp, and driuen
from one hollownesse into another. Of
which this when for the solyde nature of the
earth, and stopped passages of the earth, can
not issue or passe forth, procureth lightly and
soone a trembling in it selfe caused through
the beating and driuing back: so that retay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
this strongly moueth and shaketh the
earth, or séeking his waye, and the spirite
driuen by a narrow body of the earth, labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

yea this sometimes cleaueth the same, and
openeth it in the issuing forth at two sides.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> vttereth other notes, for after the
earth beaten vp, he reporteth that great
windes to breath and flie vp, and that fyre
and ashes to be cast forth. So that water
not to be the special cause of the earthquake:
for the water should otherwise be still, if the
same were not blowne and driuen. Nor such
a swiftnesse or hastinesse of the trembling
coulde be caused, if so much could be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the waters swelling, and that the
earth could very often breake. But it often
breaketh not in the tremblings &amp; shakings
of the earth. Yet doth this pronounce the
great plentie of vapours included in the
caues of the earth, driuen like windes by
their force, and agitation sparsed by certain
places, which when the same is caused, it
instructeth that those places to tremble, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
<pb facs="tcp:18181:77"/>
the might of the vapours forced. For
it is manifest, that the earth to be full of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
&amp; the thundring or rumbling which
is heard in the shaking of the earth, is a
note of the flying vapours. And for so much
as the vapours open the passages of the

in the tayle of the Dragon: which howe
muche the greater, and generaller the same
shall be, so muche the mightier shall the
shaking of the earthquake be: but howe

               <p>2 The second note, doth the Sunne offer
and shewe: when for certaine dayes, the
Sunne shineth dimme and darcke, without
any clowde couering him: and a meruellous
calmenesse, with a couldenesse in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
and after the Sunne setting (the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being cléere) a thinne clowde is stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

3 The thirde, a firie clowde, expressing
the kinde and forme of a burning piller in
the ayre, yeldeth a most true and sure note
(as <hi>Calistines</hi> the Philsopher reporteth) of
an Earthquake to ensue.</p>
               <p>4 In the fourth, the water in déepe pits
and welles, before an Earthquake, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a manifest cause troubled, and infected
with a saltie sauour, or with some other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
smell and taste not naturall, and
this through the pestilent exhalations, which
long within the earth, haue beene inclosed,
and begin somewhat to be sent abroade, as
vttered first <hi>Pherecides,</hi> the instructer of
the wise <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> of whom the learned
<hi>Plinie</hi> mentioneth in his second booke, and
79. Chapter. And the like <hi>Cicero,</hi> in hys
fift booke <hi>de Diuinatione.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 In the fift a marueylous quietnesse and
stilnesse of the windes silent in the region of
of the earth, subiect to the motion and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
shutte in and inclosed for certayne
Monethes afore, as the same obserued by
the auncient.</p>
               <p>6 In the sixt, by the seas and waues sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
a note may be gathered and learned,
which the saylers perceyue vndoubted to
<pb facs="tcp:18181:80"/>
insue, when as the sea rageth and beateth
without mightie windes procuring the like
swelling. And the partes and things within
shippes like shake, as buildings on the earth
and with a noyse hard vnder the earth, that
foreshewe that motion or the earthquake.</p>
               <p>7 In the seuenth, a thinne clowde after
the maner of a strake or line, very small to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
the setting in the West, long and
white, is séene (for the more part) to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
an agitation or trembling of the earth,
by which note <hi>Anaximander</hi> confirmed
sometymes to the Lacedemonians for truth
their predictions of these matters.</p>
               <p>8 In the eight, that Birdes, with many
foure footed beastes leaue or forsake the apt
places redy to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shaking of the earth, séeking
and abiding in newe places, by which these
may so defende them, from the iniurie nere
hande, and this so well proued and knowne
by obseruations, as witnessed in the bookes
of the auncient.</p>
               <p>9 In the ninth, the earth neuer trembleth
or no earthquake is caused, but when the sea
is calme and still, and the ayre so maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
still that the Foules flying haue not
breath nor ayre to beare them in their flight,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18181:80"/>
nor neuer haue, but after windes breathed
forth of hollowe vaynes and Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

earth, included before in the same.</p>
               <p>10 In the tenth, a fearefull roring, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring,
and hideous sounde like to the crie of
men, and a noyse sometimes like to the clit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
of harnest men heard in the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the earthquake commeth. But it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
hapneth, that this great roring or
thundring is heard in the earth, &amp; no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake
at all ensueth, as when the winde
without beating and trembling of the earth
findeth issue to passe.</p>
               <p>11 In the eleuenth, that the Sunne is
séene of many, for certaine dayes before, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mistie and dimme of light, as though hée
lost his light, or appéered as he were bloudie:
which dymnes or lyke sight to our eyes is
caused, through lacke of the wind to dissolue
and purge this thick and grosse ayre, which
at that tyme is inclosed within the bowels
of the earth.</p>
               <p>12 To these may be added a twelfth note,
which is the appearing of a Comet or bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
starre, a tyme before. In these if many
notes concurre, the signification is the more
certaine. For none of these notes alone is to
<pb facs="tcp:18181:81"/>
be considered and taken, that the same may
bée sufficient vnto the signifying or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewing
of an earthquake.</p>
               <p>Let this suffise (gentle reader) as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the marueylous force, and miracles of
the lightnings, with the other wonderfull
apparitions in the ayre, concluding that
these are vttered, part for mans instruction
and comfort, and part as warnings, to all
christians for the amendment of lyfe, by the
fearefull examples manifested in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,
not wythout the singular prouidence of
God, in the forewarning vs in such maner,
of the manye daungers hanging ouer our
