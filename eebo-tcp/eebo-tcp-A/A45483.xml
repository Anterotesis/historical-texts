            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Mr. Speaker,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a true ſaying of the Wiſe man, that all things happen alike to all men, as well to the good man as to the bad, there is no ſtate or condition whatſoever, either of proſperity or adverſity, but all ſorts of men are ſharers in the ſame, no man can be diſcerned truely by the outward appearance, whether he bee a good ſubject, either to his God, his Prince, or his Countrey, untill he be tryed by the touchſtone of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty: give me leave I beſeech you, to parallell the lives of either ſort, that we may in ſome meaſure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern truth from falſehood, and in ſpeaking I ſhall ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milize their lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96485:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Firſt, in Religion towards God. Secondly, in loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and due ſubjection to their Soveraigne, in their affection towards the ſafety of their Countrey.</p>
            <p>Firſt, concerning Religion, the beſt meanes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne between the true and falſe Religion is, by ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſacred Writings of the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is of it ſelfe pure, and indited by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and written by holy men, unſpotted in their lives and converſation, and by this ſacred Word may we prove whether our Religion bee of God or no, and by looking in this glaſſe we may diſcern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are in the right way or no.</p>
            <p>And looking into the ſame, find that by this truth of God, that there is but one God, one Chriſt, one Faith, one Religion, which is the Goſpell of Chriſt, &amp; the doctrine of the Prophets, and Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>In theſe two Teſtaments is contained all things neceſſary to ſalvation, if that our Religion doth hang upon this Doctrine, and no other ſecondary meanes, than is true to which comes neareſt the Proteſtant Religion, which wee profeſſe, as I really and verily believe, and conſequently that Religion, which joyneth with this Doctrine of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, the traditions and inventions of men, Prayers to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Angels, Saints; that uſeth in the exerciſe of their Religion, ſtrange and ſuperſtitious worſhipping, cringing, bowing, creeping to the Altar, uſing Pictures, Dirges, and ſuch like, cannot be true, but erroneous, nay diveliſh, and all this is uſed and maintained in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as neceſſary as the Scripture to Salvation.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96485:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Therefore it a falſe and Erronious Church, both in Doctrine and diſcipline, and all other Sects and Shiſmes, that learnes not onely on the Scripture, though never ſo contrary to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a falſe worſhipping of God, and not the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus much concerning the Religion, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the truth and falſehood thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I come now M. <hi>Speaker</hi> to the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. thing intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto you; which was how to diſcerne in a State betweene good Subjects and bad, by their loyalty and due ſubjection to their lawfull Soveraigne; in which I ſhall under favour obſerve two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Lawfull ſubjection to a King in his owne Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Commands, Edicts, and Proclamations, of the Prince and his Privie Councell.</p>
            <p>Lawfull obedience to the Lawes, Statutes, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, made, enacted by the King and the Lords, with the free conſent of his great Councell of State aſſembled in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For, the firſt to deny a willing and dutifull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to a lawfull Soveraigne and his Privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; for as <hi>Camden</hi> truely ſaith, the commands of the Lords Privie Councellours, and the Edicts of the Prince is all one, for they are inſeparable, the one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without the other, either to defend His Royall Perſon, and Kingdomes and againſt the Enemies of the ſame, either publike or private. Or to defend the ancient priviledges and Prerogatives of the King, pertinent and belonging of right to his Royal Crown and the maintenance of his Honour and Dignity. Or to defend and maintaine true Religion eſtabliſhed in the Land, according to the truth of God, is one ſigne of an evil and bad ſubject.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96485:4"/>
2 Secondly, to yeeld obedience to the commands of a King, if againſt the true Religion, againſt the Ancient and fundamentall Lawes of the Land, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſigne of an ill Subject.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, to reſiſt the lawfull power of the King, to raiſe inſurrection againſt the King, admit him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in His Religion, to conſpire againſt His Sacred Perſon, or any wayes to rebell, though commanding things againſt our Conſciences in exerciſing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or againſt the Rights, and Priviledges of the Subject, is an abſolute ſigne of a diſaffected &amp; traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſubject. And now having given the ſignes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning evill and diſloyall Subjects, I ſhall only give you in a word or two, the ſignes of diſcerning which are loyall and good Subjects, only by turning theſe three ſignes already ſhewed on the contrary ſide.</p>
            <p n="1">1 He that willingly and cheerefully endeavoureth himſelfe to obey his Soveraignes commands for the defence of his owne perſon and Kingdomes, for the defence of true Religion, for the defence of the Laws of his Country, is a loyall and good Subject.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To deny obedience to a King, commanding any thing againſt Gods true Worſhip and Religion, againſt the Ancient and Fundamentall Lawes of the Land, in indeavouring to performe the ſame, is a good Subject.</p>
            <p>Not to reſiſt the lawfull and Royall power of the King to raiſe ſedition or Inſurrection againſt his Perſon, or to ſet diviſion betweene the King and his good Subjects by rebellion. Although commanding things againſt conſcience, in the exerciſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96485:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or againſt the rights and priviledges of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but patiently for the ſame to undergo his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſpleaſure, whether it be to his impriſonment, confiſcation of goods, baniſhment, or any other pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment whatſoever, without murmuring, grudging, or reviling againſt his Soveraigne or his proceedings, but ſubmitting willingly, &amp; cheerefully himſelfe and his cauſe to Almighty God, is the only ſigne of an obedient and Loyall Subject.</p>
            <p>I come now to the ſecond meanes to know the difference betweene a good Subject and a bad, by their obedience to the Laws, Statutes and ordinances made by the King, with the whole conſent of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And in this I obſerve a twofold ſubjection: In the particular members thereof, diſſenting from the generall Votes of the whole Parliament. And ſecondly, the whole State of the Kingdome to a full Parliament.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt I conceive, if any particular member of a Parliament, although his judgement and Vote bee contrary, doe not willingly ſubmit to the reſt, is an ill Subject to the King and Country.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, to reſiſt the Ordinance of the whole State of the Kingdome, either by the ſtirring up a diſlike in the hearts of his Majeſties Subjects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the proceedings of the Parliament. To endeavour by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of Armes to compell the King and Parliament to make ſuch lawes as ſeeme beſt to them, to deny the power, Authority, and priviledges of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to caſt aſperſions upon the ſame and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; thereby inducing the King to thinke ill of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96485:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſame, and to be incenſed againſt the ſame, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the untimely diſſolution and breaking off of a Parliament, before all things be ſetled by the ſame, for the ſafety and tranquility both of King and State, is an apparant ſigne of a treacherous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyall Subject againſt his King and Country. And th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s having troubled your patience, in ſhewing the difference betweene true Proteſtants, and falſe loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Subjects and Traytors, in a State or Kingdome; and the meanes how to diſcerne them. I humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire my Actions may be compared with either, both as I am a Subject, a Proteſtant, and a native in this Country; and as I am a member of this preſent and happy Parliament, and as I ſhall be found guilty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe articles exhibited againſt my ſelfe, and the other Gentlemen, either a bad or a good Subject to my gracious Soveraigne and Native Country. To receive ſuch ſentence upon the ſame, as this Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe ſhall be conceived, to agree with Law and Juſtice.</p>
