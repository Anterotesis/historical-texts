            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>HOw much of the present Knowledge of the Parts of the World is owing to late Discoveries, may be judged by comparing the Modern with the Ancient's Accounts thereof; though possibly many such Histories may have been written in former Ages, yet few have scaped the Injury of Time, so as to be handed safe to us. 'Twas many Ages possibly before Writing was known, then known to a few, and made use of by fewer, and fewest employ'd it to this purpose. Add to this, that such as were written, remain'd for the most part Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison'd in the Cells of some Library or Study, accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a small number of Mankind, and regarded by a less, which after perished with the Place or the Decay of their own Substance. This we may judge from the loss of those many Writings mention'd by <hi>Pliny,</hi> and other of the Ancients. And we had yet found fewer, if the <hi>Art of Printing,</hi> first Invented about 240 years since, had not secured most that lasted to that time. Since which, that Loss has been repaired by a vast number of new Accessions, which besides the Satisfaction they have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Curious and Inquisitive Men by increasing their Knowledge, have excited many more to the like At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, not only of Making but of Publishing also their Discoveries. But I am not ignorant still; that as Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries have been this way preserved, so many others have been lost, to the great Detriment of the Publick. It were very desirable therefore that the Causes of these and other Defects being known, some Remedies might be found to prevent the like Losses for the future.</p>
            <p>The principal Causes I conceive may be these;
<list>
                  <item>First, The want of sufficient Instructions (to Seamen and Travellers,) to shew them what is pertinent and considerable, to be observ'd in their Voyages and Abodes, and how to make their Observations and keep Registers or Accounts of them.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb facs="tcp:58692:5"/>Next, The want of some Publick Incouragement for such as shall perform such Instructions.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, The want of fit Persons both to Promote and Disperse such Instructions to Persons fitted to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and careful to Collect Returns; and Compose them into Histories; by examining the Persons more at large upon those and other Particulars. And by separating what is pertinent from what is not so, and to be Rejected; who should have also where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to gratifie every one according to his Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, The want of some easie Way to have all such Printed: First singly, and afterwards divers of them together. It having been found that many small Tracts are lost after Printing, as well as many that are never Printed; upon which account we are much oblig'd to Mr. <hi>Haclute</hi> and Mr. <hi>Purchas,</hi> for preserving many such in their Works.</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, The want of taking care to Collect all such Relations of Voyages and Accounts of Countries as have been Published in other Languages, and Translating them either into <hi>English,</hi> or (which will be of more general use) into <hi>Latin,</hi> the learned Language of <hi>Europe.</hi> There being many such in other Countries hardly ever heard of in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Difficulties of removing which Defects is not so great but that it might easily fall even within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of a private Ability to remove, if at least Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority would but Countenance the Design, how much less then would it be if the same would afford also some moderate Encouragement and Reward?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Royal Society of</hi> London <hi>for Improving Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> has not been wanting in preparing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persing Instructions to this end, and is ready still to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it, if the Publick would allow a Recompence to the Undertakers. The desirableness and facility of this Undertaking may, I hope, in a short time produce the Expedients also. In the Interim all means should be used, to try what may be obtain'd from the Generosity of such as have had the Opportunities of knowing Foreign Countries.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:58692:5"/>There are but few who, though they know much, can yet be persuaded they know any thing worth Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating, and because the things are common and well known to them, are apt to think them so to the rest of Mankind; This Prejudice has done much mischief in this particular as well as in many other, and must be first remov'd. There are others that are conscious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of their own Knowledge, and yet either for want of Ability to write well, or of use to Compose, or of time to Study and Digest, or out of Modesty and fear to be in Print, or because they think they know not enough to make a Volume, or for not being prompted to, or earnestly solicited for it, neglect to do it; others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to do it so long till they have forgotten what they intended. Such as these Importunity would prevail upon to disclose their knowledge, if fitting Persons were found to Discourse and ask them Questions, and to Compile the Answers into a History. Of this kind was lately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in <hi>High Dutch</hi> a History of <hi>Greenland,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Foge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> from the Information of <hi>Frederick Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> who had made several Voyages to that Place, in the doing of which, he made use of the Instruction given by the Royal Society.</p>
            <p>'Tis much to be wondred that we should to this Day want a good History of most of our <hi>VVest-Indian</hi> Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Ligon</hi> has done well for the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what has been done for the <hi>Summer Islands, Virginia,</hi> &amp;c. But how far are all these short even of the knowledge of these and other Places of the <hi>VVest-Indies,</hi> which may be obtain'd from divers knowing Planters now Residing in <hi>London</hi>? And how easie were it to obtain what is Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive from some Ingenious Persons now Resident upon the Places, if some way were found to gratifie them for their Performances? However till such be found, 'tis to be hoped that the kind Acceptance only the Publick shall give to this present Work, may excite several other Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous, and knowing Men to follow this Generous Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Captain <hi>Knox,</hi> who though he could bring away nothing almost upon his Back or in his Purse, did yet Transport the whole Kingdom of <hi>Cande Uda</hi> in his Head, and by Writing and Publishing this his Knowledge, has freely given it to his Countrey, and to You Reader in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58692:6"/>'Twas not I confess without the earnest Solicitations and Endeavours of my self, and some others of his Friends obtain'd from him, but this uneasiness of parting with it was not for want of Generosity and Freedom enough in Communicating whatever he knew or had observed, but from that usual Prejudice of Modesty, and too mean an Opinion of his own Knowledge and Abi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ties of doing any thing should be worthy the view of the Publick. And had he found leisure to Compose it, he could have filled a much greater Volume with useful and pertinent, as well as unusual and strange Observations. He could have inrich't it with a more particular Description of many of their curious Plants, Fruits, Birds, Fishes, Insects, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, Stones; and told you many more of the Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and other uses of them in Trades and Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. He could have given you a compleat Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of their Language, understanding and speaking it as well as his Mother Tongue. But his Occasions would not permit him to do more at present. Yet the Civil Usage this his First-born meets with among his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treymen, may 'tis hoped oblige him to gratifie them with further Discoveries and Observations in his future Travels.</p>
            <p>To conclude, He has in this History given you a tast of his Observations. In which most Readers, though of very differing Gusts, may find somewhat very pleasant to their Pallat. The Statesman, Divine, Physitian, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yet, Merchant, Mechanick, Husbandman, may select something for their Entertainment. The Philosopher and Historian much more. I believe at least all that love Truth will be pleas'd; for from that little Conversation I had with him I conceive him to be no ways prejudiced or byassed by Interest, affection, or hatred, fear or hopes, or the vain-glory of telling Strange Things, so as to make him swarve from the truth of Matter of Fact: And for his opportunity of being informed, any one may satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self when he understands his almost 20 years Abode and Converse among them. His Skill in the Language and Customs of the People, his way of Employment in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling and Trading over all Parts of the Kingdom; add to this his Breeding till 19 years of Age under his Father a Captain for the <hi>East-India</hi> Company, and his own Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:58692:6"/>
and acquired parts; but above all his good Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which may be judged from the Employment <hi>That Worshipful Company</hi> have now freely bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, having made him Commander of the <hi>Tarquin Merchant,</hi> and intrusted him to undertake a Voyage to <hi>Tarquin.</hi>

            <p>Read therefore the Book it self, and you will find your self taken Captive indeed, but used more kindly by the Author, than he himself was by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>After a general view of the Sea Coasts, he will lead you into the Country by the Watches, through the Thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Gates, then Conduct you round upon the Mountains that Encompass and Fortifie the whole Kingdom, and by the way carry you to the top of <hi>Hommalet</hi> or <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Peak</hi>; from those he will descend with you, and shew you their chief Cities and Towns, and pass through them into the Countrey, and there acquaint you with their Husbandry, then entertain you with the Fruits, Flowers, Herbs, Roots, Plants and Trees, and by the way shelter you from Sun and Rain, with a Fan made of the <hi>Talipat-Leaf.</hi> Then shew you their Beasts, Birds, Fish, Serpents, Insects; and last of all, their Commodities. From hence he will carry you to Court, and shew you the King in the several Estates of his Life; and acquaint you with his way of Governing, Revenues, Treasures, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Governors, Military Strength, Wars: and by the way entertain you with an account of the late Rebellion against him. After which he will bring you acquainted with the Inhabitants themselves, whence you may know their different Humours, Ranks and Qualities. Then you may visit their Temples such as they are, and see the Foppery of their Priests Religious Opinions and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices both in their Worship and Festivals, and afterwards go home to their Houses and be acquainted with their Conversation and Entertainment, see their Housewifery, Furniture, Finery, and understand how they Breed and Dispose of their Children in Marriage; and in what Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and Recreations they pass their time. Then you may acquaint your self with their Language, Learning, Laws, and if you please with their Magick &amp; Iugling. And last of all with their Diseases, Sickness, Death, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:58692:7"/>
of Burial. After which he will give you a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Reason of his own Going to, and Detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Island of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and Kingdom of <hi>Conde-Uda.</hi> And of all his various Conditions, and the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that befel him there during Nineteen years and an halfs abode among them.

            <p>SInce my return home to my Native Countrey of <hi>England,</hi> after a long and Disconsolate Captivity, my Friends and Acquaintance in our Converse together have been Inquisitive into the State of that Land in which I was Captivated; whose Curiosity I indeavour to satisfie. But my Relations and Accounts of Things in those Parts were so strange and uncouth, and so different from those in these Western Nations, and withal my Discourses seeming so Delightful and Acceptable unto them, they very frequently called upon me to write what I knew of that Island of <hi>Ceilon,</hi> and to digest it into a Discourse, and make it more Publick; unto which motion I was not much unwilling, partly that I might comply with the Desires and Councels of my Friends, and chiefly that I might Publish and Declare the great Mercy of God to me, and Commemorate before all Men my singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Deliverance out of that Strange and Pagan Land, which as often as I think of or mention, I cannot but admire and adore the goodness of God towards me, there being in it so many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Footsteps of his signal Providence.</p>
            <p>I had then by me several Papers, which during my Voyage homeward from <hi>Bantam</hi> at leisure times I writ concerning the King and the Countrey, and concerning the <hi>English</hi> there, and
<pb facs="tcp:58692:8"/>
of my Escape; which Papers I forthwith set my self to Peruse and draw into a Method, and to add what more might occur to my Thoughts of those Matters, which at length I have finished, contriving what I had to relate under four Heads. The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Countrey and Products of it. The second concerning the King and his Government. The third concerning the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and their Religion and Customs, and the last concerning our Surprize, Detainment and Escape; In all which I take leave to Declare, That I have writ nothing but either what I am assured of by my own personal Knowledge to be true, and wherein I have born a great and a sad share, or what I have received from the Inhabitants themselves of such things as are commonly known to be true among them. The Book being thus perfected, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no long Meditation unto whom to present it, it could be to none but your selves (my Honoured Masters) by whose Wisdom and Success the <hi>East-Indian</hi> Parts of the World are now near as well known, as the Countries next adjacent to us. So that by your means, not only the Wealth, but the Knowledge of those <hi>Indies</hi> is brought home to us. Unto your Favour and Patronage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (Right Worshipful) I humbly presume to recommend these Papers and the Author of them, who rejoyceth at this opportunity to acknowledge the Favours you have already conferred on him, and to profess that next unto God, on you depend his Future Hopes and Expectations; being</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. A general Description of the Island.</head>
                  <p>HOw this <hi>Island</hi> lyes with respect unto the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Countries, I shall not speak at all, that being to be seen in our ordinary <hi>Sea-Cards,</hi> which describe those Parts; and but little concerning the Maritime parts of it, now under the Iurisdiction of the <hi>Dutch</hi>: my design being to relate such things onely that are new and unknown unto these <hi>Europaean</hi> Nations. It is the Inland Countrey therefore I chiefly intend to write of, which is yet an hidden Land even to the <hi>Dutch</hi> themselves that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit upon the Island. For I have seen among them a fair large <hi>Map</hi> of this Place, the best I believe extant, yet very faulty: the ordinary <hi>Maps</hi> in use among us are much more so. I have procured a new one to be drawn, with as much truth and exactness as I could, and his Iudgment will not be deemed altogether inconsiderable, who had for Twenty Years Travelled about the <hi>Iland,</hi> and knew almost every step of those Parts, especially, that most want describing.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the <hi>Sea-Coasts.</hi> Of all which the <hi>Hollander</hi> is Master. On the North end the chief places are <hi>Iafnipatan,</hi> and the Iland of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naur.</hi> On the East side <hi>Trenkimalay,</hi> and <hi>Batticalow.</hi> To the South is the City of <hi>Point de Galle.</hi> On the West the City of <hi>Columbo,</hi> so called from a Tree the Natives call <hi>Ambo,</hi> (which bears the <hi>Mango-fruit</hi>) growing in <hi>that</hi> place; but this never bare fruit, but onely leaves, which in their Language is <hi>Cola,</hi> and thence they called the Tree <hi>Cola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambo</hi>:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58692:16"/>
which the <hi>Christians</hi> in honour of <hi>Columbus</hi> turned to <hi>Columbo.</hi> It is the chief City on the Sea-coasts, where the chief Governour hath his residence. On this side also is <hi>Negumba,</hi> and <hi>Colpentine.</hi> All these already mentioned are strong fortified places: There are besides many other smaller Forts and Fortifications. All which, with considerable Territories, to wit, all round bordering upon the Sea-coasts, belong to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A general di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the Inland Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note>I proceed to the Inland-Country, being that that is now under the King of <hi>Cande.</hi> It is convenient that we first understand, that this land is divided into greater or less shares or parts. The greater divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions give me leave to call <hi>Provirces,</hi> and the less <hi>Counties,</hi> as resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ours in <hi>England,</hi> tho not altogether so big. On the North parts lyes the Province of <hi>Nourecalava,</hi> consisting of five lesser Divisions or Counties; the Province also of <hi>Hotcourly</hi> (signifying seven Counties:) it contains seven Counties. On the Eastward is <hi>Mautaly,</hi> containing three Counties. There are also lying on that side <hi>Tammanquod, Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana, Vellas, Paunoa,</hi> these are single Counties. <hi>Ouvah</hi> also containing three Counties. In this Province are Two and thirty of the Kings Captains dwelling with their Soldiers. In the Midland within those already mentioned lye <hi>Wallaponahoy</hi> (it signifies Fifty holes or vales which describe the nature of it, being nothing but Hills and Valleys,) <hi>Poncipot,</hi> (signifying five hundred Souldiers.) <hi>Goddaponahoy,</hi> (signifying fifty pieces of dry Land;) <hi>Hevoihattay</hi> (signifying sixty Souldiers,) <hi>Cote-mul, Horsepot</hi> (four hundred Souldiers.) <hi>Tunponahoy</hi> (three fifties.) <hi>Oudanour</hi> (it signifies the Upper City,) where I lived last and had Land. <hi>Tattanour</hi> (the Lower City) in which stands the Royal and chief City, <hi>Cande.</hi> These two Counties I last named, have the pre-eminence of all the rest in the Land. They are most populous, and fruitful. The Inhabitants thereof are the chief and principal men: insomuch that it is a usual saying among them, that <hi>if they want a King, they may take any man, of either of these two Counties, from the Plow, and wash the dirt off him, and he by reason of his quality and descent is fit to be a King.</hi> And they have this peculiar Priviledge, That none may be their Governour, but one born in their own Country. These ly to the Westward that follow, <hi>Oudipollat, Dolusbaug, Hotteracourly,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four Counties; <hi>Portaloon, Tuncourly,</hi> containing three Counties; <hi>Cuttiar.</hi> Which last, together with <hi>Batticalaw,</hi> and a part of <hi>Tuncourly,</hi> the <hi>Hollander</hi> took from the King during my being there. There are about ten or twelve more un-named, next bordering on the Coasts, which are under the <hi>Hollander.</hi> All these Provinces and Counties, excepting six, <hi>Tammanquod, Vellas, Paunoa, Hotteracourly, Hotcourly,</hi> and <hi>Neurecalava,</hi> ly upon Hills fruitful and dwell watered: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are called in one word <hi>Conde Vda,</hi> which signifies, <hi>On top of the Hills,</hi> and the King is styled, the King of <hi>Conde Vda.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58692:16"/>
down about their Lands is a very great benefit for the Countrey in respect of their Rice, their chief Sustenance. These Rivers are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very rocky, and so un-navigable. In them are great quantities of Fish, and the greater for want of Skill in the People to catch them. The main River of all is called <hi>Mavelagonga</hi>;<note place="margin">The great River, <hi>Mave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagonga</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</note> Which proceeds out of the Mountain called <hi>Adams Peak</hi> (of which afterwards:) it runs thro the whole Land Northward, and falls into the Sea at <hi>Trenkimalay.</hi> It may be an Arrows flight over in bredth, but not Navigable by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the many Rocks and great falls in it: Towards the Sea it is full of <hi>Aligators,</hi> but on the Mountains none at all.</p>
                  <p>It is so deep, that unless it be mighty dry weather, a man cannot wade over it, unless towards the head of it. They use little <hi>Canoues</hi> to pass over it: but there are no Bridges built over it, being so broad, and the Stream in time of Rains (which in this Countrey are very great) runs so high, that they cannot make them, neither if they could, would it be permitted; for the King careth not to make his Countrey easie to travel, but desires to keep it intricate. This River runs within a mile or less of the City of <hi>Cande.</hi> In some places of it, full of Rocks, in others clear for three or four miles.</p>
                  <p>There is another good large River running through <hi>Cotemul,</hi> and falls into that before mentioned. There are divers others brave Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that water the Countrey, tho none Navigable for the cause abovesaid.</p>
                  <p>The Land is generally covered with Woods,<note place="margin">Woody.</note> excepting the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Ovuah,</hi> and the Counties of <hi>Oudipallet,</hi> and <hi>Dolusbaug,</hi> which are naturally somewhat clear of them.</p>
                  <p>It is most populous about the middle,<note place="margin">Where most popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and healthful.</note> least near about by the Sea; how it is with those Parts under the <hi>Hollander,</hi> I know not. The Northern parts are somewhat sickly by reason of bad water, the rest very healthful.</p>
                  <p>The Valleys between their Hills are many of them quagmires,<note place="margin">The nature of the Valleys.</note> and most of them full of brave Springs of pure water: Which watery Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys are the best sort of Land for their Corn, as requiring much moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, as shall be told in its place.</p>
                  <p>On the South side of <hi>Conde Vda</hi> is an Hill,<note place="margin">The great, Hill <hi>Adams Peak,</hi> described.</note> supposed to be the highest on this Island, called in the <hi>Chingulay</hi> Language, <hi>Hamalell</hi>; but by the <hi>Portuguez</hi> and the <hi>Europaean</hi> Nations, <hi>Adams Peak.</hi> It is sharp like a Sugar-loaf, and on the Top a flat Stone with the print of a foot like a mans on it, but far bigger, being about two foot long. The people of this Land count it meritorious to go and worship this impression; and generally about their New Year, which is in <hi>March,</hi> they, Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, go up this vast and high Mountain to worship. The manner of which I shall write hereafter, when I come to describe their Religion. Out of this Mountain arise many fine Rivers, which run thro the Land, some to the Westward, some to the Southward, and the main River, <hi>viz. Mavelagonga</hi> before mentioned, to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>This Kingdom of <hi>Conde Vda</hi> is strongly fortified by Nature.<note place="margin">The natural Strength of this Kingdom.</note> For which way soever you enter into it, you must ascend vast and high mountains, and descend little or nothing. The wayes are many, but very narrow, so that but one can go abreast. The Hills are covered with Wood and great Rocks, so that 'tis scarce possible to get up any

where, but onely in the paths, in all which there are gates made of Thorns, the one at the bottom, the other at the top of the Hills, and two or three men always set to watch, who are to examine all that come and go, and see what they carry, that Letters may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, nor Prisoners or other Slaves run away. These Watches, in case of opposition, are to call out to the Towns near, who are to assist them. They oftentimes have no Arms, for they are the people of the next Towns: but their Weapons to stop people are to charge them in the Kings Name; which disobeyed, is so severely punished, that none dare resist. These Watches are but as Sentinels to give notice; for in case of War and Danger the King sends Commanders and Souldiers to ly here. But of this enough. These things being more proper to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, when we come to discourse of the <hi>Policy</hi> and Strength of the Kingdom.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The difference of the Seasons in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note>The one part of this Island differs very much from the other, both in respect of the Seasons and the Soyl. For when the Westwardly Winds blow, then it rains on the West side of the Island: and that is the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for them to till their grounds. And at the same time on the East side is very fair and dry weather, and the time of their Harvest. On the contrary, when the East Winds blow, it is Tilling time for those that inhabit the East Parts, and Harvest to those on the West. So that Harvest is here in one part or other all the Year long. These Rains and this dry weather do part themselves about the middle of the Land<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What Parts have most Rain.</note>It rains far more in the High-Lands of <hi>Conde Vda,</hi> then in the Low-Lands beneath the Hills. The North End of this Island is much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to dry weather. I have known it for five or six Years together so dry, (having no Rains, and there is no other means of water but that, being but three Springs of running water, that I know, or ever heard of) that they could not plow nor sow, and scarcely could dig Wells deep enough to get water to drink, and when they got it, its tast was brackish. At which time in other Parts there wanted not Rain; Whither the Northern People were forced to come to buy food. Let thus much suffice to have spoken of the Countreys, Soyl and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Island in general. I will proceed to speak of the <hi>Cities and Towns</hi> of it, together with some other Remarkable Matters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The most Eminent Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are Five.</note>IN this Island are several Places, where, they say, formerly stood Cities; and still retain the Name, tho little or nothing of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be now to be seen. But yet there are Five Cities now stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are the most Eminent, and where the King hath <hi>Palaces</hi> and <hi>Goods</hi>; yet even these, all of them, except that wherein his <hi>Person</hi> is, are ruined and fallen to decay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58692:17"/>The First is the City of <hi>Candy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Candy.</hi>
                     </note> so generally called by the <hi>Christians,</hi> probably from <hi>Conde,</hi> which in the <hi>Chingulays</hi> Language signifies <hi>Hills,</hi> for among them it is situated, but by the Inhabitants called <hi>Hingoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul-neure,</hi> as much as to say, <hi>the City of the Chingulay people,</hi> and <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur,</hi> signifying the Chief or Royal City. This is the Chief or <hi>Metro-political</hi> City of the whole Island. It is placed in the midst of the Island in <hi>Tattanour,</hi> bravely situate for all conveniences, excellently well watered. The Kings Palace stands on the East corner of the City, as is customary in this Land for the Kings Palaces to stand. This City is three-square like a <hi>Triangle</hi>: but no artificial strength about it, unless on the South side, which is the easiest and openest way to it, they have long since cast up a Bank of Earth cross the Valley from one Hill to the other; which nevertheless is not so steep but that a man may easily go over it any where. It may be some twenty foot in height. In every Way to come to this City about two or three miles off from it are <hi>Thorn-Gates</hi> and Watches to examine all that go and come: It is environed round with Hills. The great River coming down from <hi>Adams Peak</hi> runs within less than a mile of it on the West side. It has oftentimes been burnt by the <hi>Portuguez</hi> in their former Invasions of this Island, together with the Kings Palace and the Temples. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the King has been fain to pay them a Tribute of three Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants <hi>per annum.</hi> The King left this City about Twenty Years ago, and never since has come at it. So that it is now quite gone to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.</p>
                  <p>A second City is <hi>Nellemby-neur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nellemby.</hi>
                     </note> lying in <hi>Oudipollat,</hi> South of <hi>Cande,</hi> some Twelve miles distance. Unto this the King retired, and here kept his Court, when he forsook <hi>Candy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The City <hi>Allout-neur</hi> on the North East of <hi>Cande.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Allout-neur</hi>

                     </gap> here also he keeps great store of Corn and Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst time of War or Trouble. This is Situate in the Countrey of <hi>Bintan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Country of <hi>Bintan</hi> described.</note> which Land, I have never been at, but have taken a view of from the top of a Mountain, it seems to be smooth Land, and not much hilly; the great River runneth through the midst of it. It is all over covered with mighty Woods and abundance of Deer. But much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to dry Weather and Sickness. In these Woods is a sort of Wild People Inhabiting, whom we shall speak of in their place.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Badoula</hi> Eastward from <hi>Cande</hi> some two dayes Iourney,<note place="margin">

                  <p>This City stands in the Kingdom or Province of <hi>Ouvah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Province of <hi>Ouvah.</hi>
                     </note> which is a Countrey well watered, the Land not smooth, neither the Hills very high, wood very scarce, but what they plant about their Houses. But great plenty of Cattle, their Land void of wood being the more apt for grazing. If the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e Cattle be carried to any other Parts in this Island they will commonly dye, the reason whereof no man can tell, onely they conjecture it is occasioned by a kind of small Tree or Shrub, that grows in all Countreys but in <hi>Ouvah,</hi> the Touch or Scent of which may be Poyson to the <hi>Ouvah</hi> Cattel; though it is not so to other. The Tree hath a pretty <hi>Physical</hi> smell like an <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Shop, but no sort of Cattle will eat it. In this Cuontry grows the best <hi>Tobacco</hi> that is on this Land. <hi>Rice</hi> is more plenty here then most other things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58692:18"/>The fifth City is <hi>Digligy-neur</hi> towards the East of <hi>Cande,</hi> lying in the Country of <hi>Hevahatt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Digligy,</hi> the place of the Kings constant Residence.</note> Where the King ever since he was routed from <hi>Nellemby</hi> in the Rebellion <hi>Anno</hi> 1664. hath held his Court. The scituation of this place is very Rocky and Mountainous, the Lands Barren; So that hardly a worse place could be found out in the whole Island. Yet the King chose it, partly because it lyes about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of his Kingdom, but chiefly for his safety; having the great Mountain <hi>Gauluda</hi> behind his Palace,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gauluda.</hi>
                     </note> unto which he fled for Safety in the Rebellion, being not only high, but on the top of it lye three Towns, and Corn Fields, whence he may have necessary supplies: and it is so fenced with steep Cliffs, Rocks and Woods, that a few men here will be able to defend themselves against a great Army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Many Ruins of Cities.</note>There are besides these already mentioned, several other ruinous places that do still retain the name of Cities, where Kings have Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tho now little Foot-steps remaining of them. At the North end of this Kings Dominions is one of these Ruinous Cities, called <hi>Anurodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burro</hi> where they say Ninety Kings have Reigned,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anurodgburro.</hi>
                     </note> the Spirits of whom they hold now to be Saints in Glory, having merited it by making <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goda's</hi> and Stone Pillars and Images to the honour of their <hi>Gods,</hi> whereof there are many yet remaining: which the <hi>Chingulayes</hi> count very meritorious to worship, and the next way to Heaven. Near by is a River, by which we came when we made our escape: all along which is abundance of hewed stones, some long for Pillars, some broad for paving. Over this River there have been three Stone Bridges built upon Stone Pillars, but now are fallen down; and the Countrey all desolate without Inhabitants. At this City of <hi>Anurodgburro</hi> is a Watch kept, beyond which are no more people that yield obedience to the King of <hi>Candy.</hi> This place is above Ninety miles to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the City of <hi>Candy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The nature of the Northern Parts.</note> In these Northern Parts there are no Hills, nor but two or three Springs of running water, so that their Corn ripeneth with the help of Rain.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Port of <hi>Portaloon</hi>: It affords Salt.</note>There is a <hi>Port</hi> in the Countrey of <hi>Portaloon</hi> lying on the West side of this Island, whence part of the Kings Countrey is supplyed with <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Fish</hi>: where they have some small Trade with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who have a Fort upon the Point, to prevent Boats from coming: But the Eastern Parts being too far, and Hilly, to drive Cattel thither for <hi>Salt,</hi> Gods Providence hath provided them a place on the East side nearer them, which in their Language they call <hi>Leawava.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leawava</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords Salt in abundance.</note> Where the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Winds blowing, the Sea beats in, and in Westwardly Winds (being then fair weather there) it becomes Salt, and that in such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that they have as much as they please to fetch. This Place of <hi>Leawava</hi> is so contrived by the Providence of the <hi>Almighty Creator,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Described.</note> that neither the <hi>Portuguez</hi> nor <hi>Dutch</hi> in all the time of their Wars could ever prevent this People from having the benefit of this Salt, which is the principal thing that they esteem in time of Trouble or War; and most of them do keep by them a store of Salt against such times. It is, as I have heard, environed with Hills on the Land side, and by Sea not convenient for Ships to ride; and very sickly, which they do impute to the power of a great God, who dwelleth near by in a Town they call <hi>Cotterag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:58692:18"/>
that those who otherwise are Enemies to this King, and have served both <hi>Portuguez</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> against him, yet would never assist either to make Invasions this way.</p>
                  <p>Having said thus much concerning the <hi>Cities</hi> and other Eminent places of this Kingdom,<note place="margin">Their Towns how Built.</note> I will now add a little concerning their <hi>Towns.</hi> The best are those that do belong to their <hi>Idols,</hi> wherein stand their <hi>Dewals</hi> or Temples. They do not care to make Streets by building their Houses together in rowes, but each man lives by himself in his own Plantation, having an hedg it may be and a ditch round about him to keep out Cattel. Their Towns are always placed some distance from the High-ways, for they care not that their Towns should be a thorough-fair for all people, but onely for those that have business with them. They are not very big, in some may be Forty, in some Fifty houses, and in some above an Hundred: and in some again not above eight or ten.</p>
                  <p>And as I said before of their <hi>Cities,</hi> so I must of their <hi>Towns,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Many lye in Ruins, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> That there are many of them here and there lie desolate, occasioned by their voluntary forsaking them, which they often do, in case many of them fall sick, and two or three die soon after one another: For this they conclude to happen from the hand of the <hi>Devil.</hi> Whereupon they all leave their Town and go to another, thinking thereby to avoid him: Thus relinquishing both their Houses and Lands too. Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when they think the Devil hath departed the place, some will sometimes come back and re-assume their Lands again.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of their Corn, with their manner of Husbandry.</head>
                  <p>HAving discoursed hitherto of the Countrey,<note place="margin">The Products and Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the Countrey.</note> method will require that I proceed now to the <hi>Products</hi> of it; <hi>Viz.</hi> their Fruits, Plants, Beasts, Birds, and other Creatures, Minerals, Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp;c. whereof I must declare once for all, That I do not pretend to write an Exact and Perfect Treatise, my time and <hi>leisure</hi> not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me so to do; but only to give a Relation of some of the chief of these things, and as it were a tast of them, according as they that occur to my Memory while I am writing. I shall first begin with their Corn, as being the Staff of their Countrey.</p>
                  <p>They have divers sorts of <hi>Corn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Corn of divers sorts.</note> tho all different from ours. And here I shall first speak of their <hi>Rice,</hi> the Choice and Flower of all their Corn, and then concerning the other inferior kinds among them.</p>
                  <p>Of <hi>Rice</hi> they have several sorts,<note place="margin">Rice.</note> and called by several names accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different times of their ripening: However in tast little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing from one another. Some will require seven Months before it come to maturity, called <hi>Mauvi</hi>; some six, <hi>Hauteal</hi>; others will ripen in five, <hi>Honorowal</hi>; others in four, <hi>Henit</hi>; and others in three, <hi>Aulfancol:</hi> The price of all these is one and the same. That which is soonest ripe, is most savoury to the tast; but yieldeth the least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. It may be asked then, why any other sort of Rice is sown,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58692:19"/>
but that which is longest a Ripening, seeing it brings in most Profit? In answer to this, you must know, That all these sorts of Rice do ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely require Water to grow in,<note place="margin">
                        <p>Grows in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>Their Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Corn Lands.</p>
                     </note> all the while they stand; so that the Inhabitants take great pains in procuring and saving water for their Grounds, and in making Conveyances of Water from their Rivers and Ponds into their Lands, which they are very ingenious in; also in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling their Corn Lands, which must be as smooth as a <hi>Bowling-Green,</hi> that the Water may cover all over. Neither are their steep and Hilly Lands uncapable of being thus overflown with Water. For the doing of which they use this Art. They level these Hills into narrow Allies, some three, some eight foot wide one beneath another, according to the steep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Hills, working and digging them in that fashion that they lye smooth and flat, like so many Stairs up the Hills one above another. The Waters at the top of the Hills falling downwards are let into these Allies, and so successively by running out of one into another, water all; first the higher Lands, and then the lower. The highest Allies having such a quantity of Water as may suffice to cover them, the rest runs over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the next, and that having its proportion, unto the next, and so by degrees it falls into all these hanging parcels of Ground. These Waters last sometimes a longer, and sometimes a shorter Season. Now the Rice they sow is according as they foresee their stock of Water will last. It will sometimes last them two or three, or four or five Months, more or less; the Rice therefore they chuse to cast into the Ground,<note place="margin">Why they do not alwayes sow the best kind of Rice.</note> is of that sort that may answer the duration of the Water. For all their Crop would be spoilt if the Water should fail them before their Corn grew ripe. If they foresee their Water will hold out long, then they sow the best and most profitable Rice, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is longest a ripening; but if it will not, they must be content to sow of the worser sorts; that is, those that are sooner ripe. Again, they are forced sometimes to sow this younger Rice, for the preventing the damage it might otherwise meet with, if it should stand longer. For their Fields are all in common, which after they have sown, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>close till Harvest; But as soon as the Corn first sown becomes ripe, when the Owner has reaped it, it is lawful for him to break down his Fences, and let in his Cattle for grazing; which would prove a great mischief to that Corn that required to stand a Month or two longer. Therefore if they are constrained to sow later than the rest, either through want or sloth, or some other Impediment, yet they make use of that kind of Rice that will become ripe, equal with that first sown. And so they all observe one time of reaping to prevent their Corn being trampled down or eaten up by the Cattle.<note place="margin">They sow at different times, but reap together.</note> Thus they time their Corn to their Harvest; some sowing sooner, some la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but all reaping together, unless they be Fields that are enclosed by themselves; and peculiar to one Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Their Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Pools.</note>Where there are no Springs or Rivers to furnish them with Water, as it is in the Northern Parts, where there are but two or three Springs, they supply this defect by saving of rain Water; which they do, by casting up great Banks in convenient places to stop and contain the Rains that fall, and so save it till they have occasion to let it out into their Fields: They are made rounding like a C or Half-Moon, every Town has one of these <hi>Ponds,</hi> which if they can but get filled with Water, they count their Corn is as good as in the Barn. It was no
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58692:19"/>
small work to the ancient Inhabitants to make all these Banks, of which there is a great number, being some two, some three Fathoms in height, and in length some above a Mile, some less, not all of a size. They are now grown over with great Trees, and so seem natural Hills. When they would use the Water, they cut a gap in one end of the Bank, and so draw the Water by little and little, as they have occasion for the wat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ring their Corn. These Ponds in dry weather dry up quite. If they should dig these Ponds deep, it would not be so convenient for them. It would indeed contain the Water well, but would not so well nor in such Plenty empty out it self into their Grounds. In these Ponds are <hi>Aligators,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aligators</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in them.</note> which when the Water is dried up depart into the Woods, and down to the Rivers; and in the time of Rains come up again into the Ponds. They are but small, nor do use to catch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nevertheless they stand in some fear of them. The Corn they sow in these Parts is of that sort that is soonest ripe, fearing lest their Waters should fail. As the Water dries out of these Ponds, they make use of them for Fields, treading the Mud with Buffeloes,<note place="margin">They sow Corn on the Mud.</note> and then sowing Rice thereon, and frequently casting up Water with Scoops on it. I have hitherto spoken of those <hi>Rices</hi> that require to grow in Water.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another sort of Rice,<note place="margin">A sort of Rice that grows without Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> which will ripen tho' it stand not alway in Water: and this sort of Corn serves for those places, where they cannot bring their Waters to overflow; this will grow with the Rains that fall; but is not esteemed equal with the others, and differs both in scent and taste from that which groweth in the watery Fields.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary Season of seed time,<note place="margin">The Seasons of Seed-time and Harvest.</note> is in the Months of <hi>Iuly</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi> and their Harvest in or about <hi>February</hi>; but for Land that is well watered, they regard no Season; the Season is all the year long. When they Till their Grounds, or Reap their Corn, they do it by whole Towns generally, all helping each other for <hi>Attoms,</hi> as they call it; that is, that they may help them as much, or as many days again in their Fields, which accordingly they will do. They Plough only with a crooked piece of Wood, something like an Elbow, which roots up the Ground, as uneven as if it were done by Hogs, and then they overflow it with water.</p>
                  <p>But if any be so curious as to know more particularly how they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and prepare their Lands,<note place="margin">A particular description of their Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry.</note> and sow their Corn, take this account of it. But before we go to work, it will be convenient first to describe the Tools. To begin therefore with their <hi>Plough.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Plough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> I said before it was a crooked piece of Wood, it is but little bigger than a Man's Arm, one end whereof is to hold by, and the other to root up the Ground. In the hollow of this Plough is a piece of Wood fastned some three or four Inches thick, equal with the bredth of the Plough; and at the end of the Plough, is fixt an Iron Plate to keep the VVood from wearing. There is a Beam let in to that part of it that the Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man holds in his hand, to which they make their <hi>Buffaloes</hi> fast to drag it.</p>
                  <p>These Ploughs are proper for this Countrey,<note place="margin">The conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of these Ploughs.</note> because they are lighter, and so may be the more easie for turning, the Fields being short, so that they could not turn with longer, and if heavier, they would sink and be unruly in the mud. These Ploughs bury not the grass as ours do,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58692:20"/>
and there is no need they should. For their endeavour is only to root up the Ground, and so they overflow it with VVater, and this rots the Grass.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Their first Ploughing.</note>They Plough twice before they sow. But before they begin the first time, they let in VVater upon their Land, to make it more fost and pliable for the Plough. After it is once Ploughed, they make up their Banks. For if otherwise they should let it alone till after the second Ploughing, it would be mere Mud, and not hard enough to use for Banking.<note place="margin">Their Banks, and use of them.</note> Now these Banks are greatly necessary, not only for Paths for the People to go upon through the Fields, who otherwise must go in the Mud, it may be knee deep; but chiefly to keep in and contain their VVater, which by the help of these Banks they overflow their Grounds with. These Banks they make as smooth with the backside of their Houghs, as a Bricklayer can smooth a VVall with his Trowel. For in this they are very neat. These Banks are usually not above a Foot over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Their second Ploughing.</note>After the Land is thus Ploughed and the Banks finished, it is laid under water again for some time, till they go to Ploughing the second time. Now it is exceeding muddy, so that the trampling of the Cattel that draws the Plough, does as much good as the Plough; for the more muddy the better. Sometimes they use no Plough this second time, but only drive their Cattel over to make the Ground the muddier.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Seed-Corn,</note>Their Lands being thus ordered, they still keep them overflowed with Water, that the Weeds and Grass may rot. Then they take their Corn and lay it a soak in Water a whole night, and the next day take it out, and lay it in a heap, and cover it with green leaves, and so let it lye some five or six days to make it grow. Then they take and wet it again, and lay it in a heap covered over with leaves as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and so it grows and shoots out with Blades and Roots.<note place="margin">And their Land after it is Ploughed.</note> In the mean time while this is thus a growing, they prepare their Ground for sowing; which is thus: They have a Board about four foot long, which they drag over their Land by a yoke of Buffaloes, not flat ways, but upon the edge of it. The use of which is, that it jumbles the Earth and Weeds together, and also levels and makes the Grounds smooth and even, that so the Water (for the ground is all this while under water) may stand equal in all places. And wheresoever there is any little hummock standing out of the Water, which they may easily see by their eye, with the help of this Board they break and lay even. And so it stands overflown while their Seed is growing, and become fit to sow, which usually is eight days after they lay it in soak.</p>
                  <p>When the Seed is ready to sow, they drain out all the Water, and with little Boards of about a foot and a half long, fastned upon long Poles, they trim the Land over again, laying it very smooth, making small Furrows all along, that in case Rain or other Waters should come in, it might drain away; for more Water now would endanger rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Corn.<note place="margin">Their manner of sowing.</note> And then they sow their Corn, which they do with very exact evenness, strewing it with their hands, just as we strew Salt upon Meat.</p>

certain gaps made in the Banks to let out the water, these are now stopped to keep it in. Which is not only to nourish the Corn, but to kill the weeds. For they keep their Fields as clean as a Garden without a weed. Then when the Corn is grown about a span high, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men come and weed it, and pull it up where it grew too thick, and transplant it where it wants. And so it stands overflown till the Corn be ripe, when they let out the water again to make it dry for reaping. They never use any dung, but their manner of plowing and soaking of their Ground serves instead thereof.</p>
                  <p>At reaping they are excellent good, just after the <hi>English</hi> manner.<note place="margin">Their manner of Reaping.</note> The whole Town, as I said before, as they joyn together in Tilling, so in their Harvest also; For all fall in together in reaping one man's Field, and so to the next, until every mans Corn be down. And the Custome is, that every man, during the reaping of his Corn, finds all the rest with Victuals. The womens work is to gather up the Corn after the Reapers, and carry it all together.</p>
                  <p>They use not Threshing, but tread out their Corn with Cattel,<note place="margin">They tread out their Corn with Cattel.</note> which is a far quicker and easier way. They may tread out in a day forty or fifty Bushels at least with the help of half a dozen Cattel.</p>

Then the women, whose proper work it is, bring each their burthen of reaped Corn upon their heads, and go round in the Pit three times, and then fling it down. And after this without any more ado, bring in the rest of the Corn as fast as they can. For this Labour, and that of weeding, the Women have a Fee due to them, which they call <hi>Warapol,</hi> that is as much Corn, as shall cover the Stone and the other Conjuration-Instruments at the bottom of the Pit.</p>
                  <p>They will frequently carry away their new reaped Corn into the Pit, and tread it out presently as soon as they have cut it down, to secure it from the Rains, which in some Parts are very great and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and Barns they have none big enough, But in other places not so much given to Rains, they will sometimes set it up in a <hi>Cock,</hi> and let it stand some months.</p>
                  <p>They unshale their Rice from its outward husk by beating it in a Mortar,<note place="margin">How they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>husk their Rice.</note> or on the Ground more often; but some of these sorts of Rice must first be boyled in the husk, otherwise in beating it will break to powder.

If they which are not used to it, eat it, it will gripe their Bellies; When they are minded to grind it, they have for their Mill two round stones, which they turn with their hands by the help of a stick: There are several sorts of this Corn. Some will ripen in three months, and some require four. If the Ground be good, it yields a great encrease; and grows both on the Hills and in the Plains. There is another Corn called <hi>Tanna</hi>;<note place="margin">

I think it gives the greatest encrease of any one seed in the World. Each Husbandman sowes not above a Pottle at a Seeds-time. It growes up two foot, or two foot and an half from the ground. The way of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering it when ripe, is, that the Women (whose office it is) go and crop off the ears with their hands, and bring them home in baskets. They onely take off the ears of <hi>Coracan</hi> also, but they being tough, are cut off with knives. This <hi>Tanna</hi> must be parched in a Pan, and then is beaten in a Mortar to unhusk it.

Pleasant Fruits to eat ripe they care not at all to do, They look only after those that may fill the Belly, and satisfie their hunger when their Corn is spent, or to make it go the further. These onely they plant, the other Fruits of Pleasure plant themselves, the seeds of the ripe Fruits shedding and falling on the ground naturally spring up again. They have all Fruits that grow in <hi>India.</hi> Most sorts of these delicious Fruits they gather before they be ripe, and boyl them to make <hi>Carrees,</hi> to use the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuguez</hi> word,<note place="margin">The best Fruits, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they grow, reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the King.</note> that is somewhat to eat with and relish their Rice.

not the Owner himself, dares presume under pain of some great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, if not death, to touch them. And when they are ripe, they are wrapped in white cloth, and carried to him who is Governour of that Countrey wherein they grow: and if they be without any defect or blemish, then being wrapped up again in white cloth, he presents them to the King. But the owner in whose Ground they grow is paid nothing at all for them: it is well if he be not compelled to carry them himself into the bargain unto the King, be it never so far. These are Reasons why the People regard not to plant more than just to keep them alive.</p>
                  <p>But to specifie some of the chief of the Fruits in request among them. I begin with their <hi>Betel-Nuts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Betel-Nuts.</note> the Trees that bear them grow only on the South and West sides of this Island. They do not grow wild, they are only in their Towns, and there like unto Woods, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closures to distinguish one mans Trees from anothers; but by marks of great Trees, Hummacks or Rocks each man knows his own. They plant them not, but the Nuts being ripe fall down in the grass and so grow up to Trees.<note place="margin">The Trees. The Fruit.</note> They are very streight and tall, few bigger than the calf of a mans Leg. The Nuts grow in bunches at the top, and being ripe look red and very lovely like a pleasing Fruit. When they gather them, they lay them in heaps until the shell be somewhat rotted, and then dry them in the Sun, and afterwards shell them with a sharp stick one and one at a time. These Trees will yield some 500, some a 1000, some 1500 Nuts, and some but three or four hundred. They bear but once in the Year generally, but commonly there are green Nuts enough to eat all the Year long. The leaves of it are somewhat like those of a <hi>Coker-Nut</hi> Tree,<note place="margin">The Leaves.</note> they are five or six foot long, and have other lesser leaves growing out of the sides of them, like the feathers on each side of a quill. The <hi>Chingulays</hi> call the large leaves <hi>the boughs,</hi> and the leaves on the sides, <hi>the leaves.</hi> They fall off every Year, and the skin upon which they grow, with them. These skins grow upon the body of the Tree,<note place="margin">The Skins, and their use.</note> and the leaves grow out on them. They also clap about the buds or blossoms which bear the Nuts, and as the buds swell, so this <hi>skin-cover</hi> gives way to them, till at length it falls quite off with the great leaf on it. It is somewhat like unto Leather, and of great use unto the Countrey People. It serves them instead of Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For bigness they are according to the Trees, some bigger, some less, ordinarily they are about two foot length, and a foot and an half in breadth. In this Countrey are no Inns to go to, and therefore their manner when they Travel is, to carry ready dressed what provisions they can, which they make up in these leaves. The Trees within have onely a kind of pith, and will split from one end to the other, the Wood is hard and very strong;<note place="margin">The VVood.</note> they use it for Laths for their Houses, and also for Rails for their Hedges, which are only stakes struck in the ground, and rails tyed along with <hi>rattans,</hi> or other <hi>withs</hi> growing in the Woods.<note place="margin">The profit the Fruit yields.</note> Money is not very plentiful in this Land, but by means of these Nuts, which is a great Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to carry to the Coasts of <hi>Cormandel,</hi> they furnish themselves with all things they want.

The Kernels do very much resemble <hi>Chesnuts</hi> both in colour and tast, and are almost as good: the poor people will boyl them or roast them in the embers, there being usually a good heap of them lying in a corner by the fire side; and when they go a Iourney, they will put them in a bag for their Provisions by the way. One <hi>Iack</hi> may contain three pints or two quarts of these seeds or kernels. When they cut these <hi>Iacks,</hi> there comes running not a white thick substance like tar, and will stick just like Birdlime, which the Boyes make use of to catch Birds, which they call <hi>Cola,</hi> or bloud of the <hi>Cos.</hi> Some will mix this with the flower of Rice, and it will eat like Eggs.</p>

If these Trees stand near any houses, the smell of the blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms so much annoyes them, that they regarding not the seed, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with cut them down. This Tree is within a Pith only, which is very good to eat if they cut the Tree down before it runs to seed.<note place="margin">The pith good to eat.</note> They beat it in Mortars to Flower, and bake Cakes of it; which tast much like to white bread. It serves them instead of Corn before their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest be ripe.</p>
                  <p>The next Tree is the <hi>Kettule.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Kettule</hi> yields a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious juice.</note> It groweth streight, but not so tall or big as a <hi>Coker-Nut-Tree</hi>; the inside nothing but a white Pith, as the former. It yieldeth a sort of Liquor, which they call <hi>Tellegie</hi>: it is rarely sweet and pleasing to the Pallate, and as wholsom to the Body, but no stronger than water. They take it down from the Tree twice, and from some good Trees thrice, in a day. An ordinary Tree will yield some three, some four Gallons in a day, some more and some less. The which Liquor they boyl and make a kind of brown Sugar, called <hi>Iaggory</hi>; but if they will use their skill, they can make it as white as the second best Sugar: and for any use it is but little inferior to ordinary Sugar. The manner how they take this Liquor from the Tree is thus; When the Tree is come to maturity, first out of the very top there cometh out a bud, which if they let it grow, will bear a round fruit, which is the seed it yieldeth, but is only good to set for

encrease. This bud they cut and prepare, by putting to it several sorts of things, as Salt, Pepper, Lemons, Garlick, Leaves, &amp;c. which keeps it at a stand, and suffers it not to ripen. So they daily cut off a thin slice off the end, and the Liquor drops down in a Pot, which they hang to catch it.</p>

As long as the Tree is growing the leaves shed; but when the Tree is come to its full growth, they remain many years upon the Tree before they fall; and when they fall, there are no new ones come again: The top-bud, as it ripens and withers, other buds come out lower and lower every Year till they come to the bottom of the Boughs, and then it hath done bearing, and so may stand seven or ten years, and then dyeth.</p>

The Trees are not very great, but sizable. The <hi>Cinnamon</hi> is the Bark or Rind,<note place="margin">The Bark.</note> when it is on the Tree it looks whitish. They scrape it and pull it off, and dry it in the Sun: they take it onely from off the smaller Trees, altho the Bark of the greater is as sweet to the smell and as strong to the tast. The Wood has no smell,<note place="margin">The VVood.</note> in colour white, and soft like <hi>Fir.</hi> Which for any use they cut down, favouring them no more than other wild Trees in the Wood. The Leaf much resembleth the <hi>Laurel</hi> both in colour and thickness;<note place="margin">The Leaf.</note> the difference is, whereas the <hi>Laurel</hi> hath but one strait rib throughout, whereon the green spreads it self on each sides, the <hi>Cinnamon</hi> hath three by which the Leaf stretches forth it self.

They use it for Oyntments for Aches and Pains, and to burn in Lamps to give light in their houses: but they make no Candles of it, neither are any Candles used by any but the King.</p>
                  <p>Here are many sorts of Trees that bear <hi>Berries</hi> to make <hi>Oyl</hi> of, both in the Woods and Gardens, but not eatable, but used only for their Lamps.</p>
                  <p>There are other Trees remarkable either for their <hi>strangeness,</hi> or <hi>use,</hi> or both. Of these I shall mention a few.</p>

They make use of it for <hi>Physic</hi> in Purges; and also to dy black colour: Which they do after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; They take the fruit and beat it to pieces in Mortars, and put it thus beaten into water; and after it has been soaking a day or two, it changeth the water, that it looks like Beer. Then they dip their cloth in it, or what they mean to dy, and dry it in the Sun. And then they dip it in black mud, and so let it ly about an hour, then take it and wash it in water: and now it will appear of a pale black. Then being dry, they dip it again into the aforesaid <hi>Dy,</hi> and it becomes a very good black.</p>
                  <p>Another use there is of this water.<note place="margin">This water will brighten rusty Iron, and serve instead of Ink.</note> It is this: Let any rusty Iron ly a whole night in it, and it will become bright; and the water look black like Ink, insomuch that men may write with it. These Trees grow but in some Parts of the Land, and nothing near so plentiful as <hi>Cinnamon.</hi> The Berries the Drugsters in the City there, do fell in their Shops.</p>

These leaves they split to weave Matts withal. The Tree bears a <hi>bud</hi> above a span long, tapering somewhat like a Sugar-loaf. Leaves cover this bud folding it about, like the leaves of a <hi>Cabbage.</hi> Which leaves smell rarely sweet, and look of a lovely yellow colour like gold. This bud blowes into divers bunches of Flowers, spreading it self open like a <hi>Plume of Feathers,</hi> each Flower whitish, but very small.

No sort of Cattel will eat it, no, not the <hi>Goats,</hi> that will sometimes brouze upon rank poyson. There is abundance of these Trees every where, and they grow in all Countreys, but in <hi>Ouvah.</hi> And this is supposed to be the cause, that the <hi>Ouvah</hi>-Cattle dy, when they are brought thence to any other Country. They attribute it to the smell of this Tree, of such a veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous nature it is to Beasts. And therefore to destroy their <hi>Fleas,</hi> or to keep their houses clear of them, they sweep them with Brooms made of this shrub. 'Tis excellent good for firing, and will burn when it is green. There are no other coals the <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> use, but what are made of this wood.</p>

There are many of these Trees, which they plant all the Land over, and have more care of, than of any other. They pave round under them like a Key, sweep often under them to keep them clean; they light Lamps, and set up their Images under them: and a stone Table is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced under some of them to lay their Sacrifices on. They set them every where in Towns and High wayes, where any convenient pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are: they serve also for shade to Travellers. They will also set them in memorial of persons deceased, to wit, there, where their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were burnt. It is held meritorious to plant them, which, they say, he that does, shall dy within a short while after, and go to Heaven: But the oldest men onely that are nearest death in the course of Nature, do plant them, and none else; the younger sort desiring to live a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer in this World before they go to the other.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Roots for Food.</note>SOme of these are for <hi>Food,</hi> and some for <hi>Medicine.</hi> I begin with their <hi>Roots,</hi> which with the <hi>Iacks</hi> before mentioned, being many, and generally bearing well, are a great help towards the suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of this People. These by the <hi>Chingulays</hi> by a general name are called <hi>Alloes,</hi> by the <hi>Portugals</hi> and us <hi>Inyames.</hi> They are of divers and sundry sorts, some they plant, and some grow wild; those that grow
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58692:26"/>
wild in the Woods are as good, onely they are more scarce and grow deeper, and so more difficult to be plucked up. It would be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to mention their particular names; I shall onely speak a little in general of them. They serve both for Food, and for <hi>Carrees,</hi> that is, sauce, or for a relish to their Rice. But they make many a meal of them alone to lengthen out their Rice, or for want of it: and of these there is no want to those that will take pains but to set them, and cheap enough to those that will buy.</p>
                  <p>There are two sorts of these <hi>Alloes</hi>;<note place="margin">The manner of their grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> some require Trees or Sticks to run up on; others require neither. Of the former sort, some will run up to the tops of very large Trees, and spread out very full of branches, and bear great bunches of blossoms, but no use made of them; The Leaves dy every year, but the Roots grow still, which some of them will do to a prodigious bigness within a Year or two's time, becoming as big as a mans wast. The fashion of them somewhat roundish, rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and uneven, and in divers odd shapes, like a log of cleft wood: they have a very good, savoury mellow tast.</p>
                  <p>Of those that do not run up on Trees, there are likewise sundry sorts; they bear a long stalk and a broad leaf; the fashion of these Roots are somewhat roundish, some grow out like a mans fingers, which they call <hi>Angul-alloes,</hi> as much as to say <hi>Finger-Roots</hi>; some are of a white colour, some of a red.</p>
                  <p>Those that grow in the Woods run deeper into the Earth, they run up Trees also. Some bear blossoms somewhat like <hi>Hopps,</hi> and they may be as big as a mans Arm.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Herbs</hi> to boyl and eat with Butter they have excellent good ones, and several sorts:<note place="margin">Boyling Herbs.</note> some of them are six months growing to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, the stalk as high as a man can reach, and being boyled almost as good as <hi>Asparagus.</hi> There are of this sort, some having leaves and stalks as red as blood, some green: some the leaves green, and the stalk very white.</p>
                  <p>They have several other sorts of Fruits which they dress and eat with their Rice,<note place="margin">Fruits for sawce.</note> and tast very savoury, called <hi>Carowela, Wattacul, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rongo, Cacorehouns,</hi> &amp;c. the which I cannot compare to any things that grow here in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have of our <hi>English</hi> Herbs and Plants, <hi>Colworts, Carrots, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dishes, Fennel, Balsam, Spearmint, Mustard.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Europaean</hi> Herbs and Plants among them.</note> These, excepting the two last, are not the natural product of the Land, but they are transplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hither; By which I perceive all other <hi>European</hi> Plants would grow there: They have also <hi>Fern, Indian</hi> Corn.

I will not here enter into a larger discourse of the Medicinal Vertues of their Plants, &amp;c. of which there are hundreds: onely as a Specimen thereof, and likewise of their Skill to use them; I will relate a Passage or two. A Neighbour of mine a <hi>Chingulay,</hi> would undertake to cure a broken Leg or Arm by
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58692:27"/>
application of some Herbs that grow in the Woods, and that with that speed, that the broken Bone after it was set should knit by the time one might boyl a pot of Rice and three <hi>carrees,</hi> that is about an hour and an half or two hours; and I knew a man who told me he was thus cured. They will cure an <hi>Imposthume</hi> in the Throat with the Rind of a Tree called <hi>Amaranga,</hi> (whereof I my self had the experience;) by chawing it for a day or two after it is prepared, and swallowing the spittle. I was well in a day and a Night, tho before I was exceedingly ill, and could not swallow my Victuals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Their Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note>Of <hi>Flowers</hi> they have great varieties, growing wild, for they plant them not. There are <hi>Roses</hi> red and white, scented like ours: several sorts of sweet smelling Flowers, which the young Men and Women gather and tie in their hairs to perfume them; they tie up their hair in a bunch behind, and enclose the Flowers therein.</p>
                  <p>There is one Flower deserves to be mentioned for the rarity and use of it,<note place="margin">A Flower that serves instead of a Dial.</note> they call it a <hi>Sindric-mal,</hi> there are of them some of a Murry colour, and some white. Its Nature is, to open about four a clock in the Evening, and so continueth open all Night until the morning, when it closeth up it self till four a clock again. Some will transplant them out of the Woods into their Gardens to serve them instead of a Clock, when it is cloudy that they cannot see the <hi>Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another white Flower like our <hi>Iasmine,</hi> well scented, they call them <hi>Picha-mauls,</hi> which the King hath a parcel of brought to him every morning, wrapt in a white cloth, hanging upon a staff, and carried by people, whose peculiar office this is. All people that meet these Flowers, out of respect to the King, for whose use they are, must turn out of the Way; and so they must for all other things that go to the King being wrapt up in white cloth. These Officers hold Land of the King for this service: their Office is, also to plant these Flowers, which they usually do near the Rivers where they most delight to grow: Nay, they have power to plant them in any mans Ground, and enclose that ground when they have done it for the sole use of their Flowers to grow in: which Inclosures they will keep up for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years, until the Ground becomes so worn, that the Flowers will thrive there no longer, and then the Owners resume their own Lands again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hop-Mauls,</hi> are Flowers growing upon great Trees, which bear nothing else, they are rarely sweet scented; this is the chief Flower the young people use; and is of greatest value among them.</p>

And we begin first with their <hi>Beasts.</hi> They have <hi>Cowes, Buffaloes, Hogs, Goats, Deer, Hares, Dogs, Iacols, Apes, Tygers, Bears, Elephants,</hi> and other Wild Beasts. <hi>Lions, Wolves, Horses, Asses, Sheep,</hi> they have none.

                     <hi>Deer</hi> are in great abundance in the Woods, and of several sorts, from the largeness of a <hi>Cow</hi> or <hi>Buffalo,</hi> to the smalness of a <hi>Hare.</hi>

Here was a Black <hi>Tygre</hi> catched and brought to the King, and afterwards a <hi>Deer</hi> milk white; both which he very much esteemed; there being no more either before or since ever heard of in that Land.</p>
                  <p>If any desire to know how this <hi>white Deer</hi> was caught,<note place="margin">The way how a Wild Deer was catched.</note> it was thus; This Deer was observed to come on Evenings with the rest of the Herd to a great Pond to drink; the People that were ordered to catch this Deer, fenced the Pond round and plain about it with high stakes, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving onely one wide gap. The men after this done lay in ambush, each with his bundle of Stakes ready cut. In the Evening the Deer came with the rest of the Herd to drink according to their wont. As soon as they were entred within the stakes, the men in ambush fell to their work, which was to fence in the gap left, which, there being little less than a Thousand men, they soon did; and so all the Herd were easily caught; and this among the rest.</p>
                  <p>The King hath also an <hi>Elephant</hi> spotted or speckled all the body over,<note place="margin">Of their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants.</note> which was lately caught; and tho he hath many and very state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Elephants,</hi> and may have as many more as he pleases, yet he prefers this before them all.

                  <p>I will first relate the manner of taking them, and afterwards their Sagacity, with other things that occur to my memory concerning them. This Beast, tho he be so big and wise, yet he is easily catched. When the King commands to catch <hi>Elephants,</hi> after they have found them they like, that is such as have Teeth; for tho there be many in the Woods, yet but few have Teeth, and they males onely: unto these they drive some <hi>She-Elephants,</hi> which they bring with them for the purpose; which when once the <hi>males</hi> have got a sight of, they will never leave, but follow them wheresoever they go; and the <hi>females</hi> are so used to it, that they will do whatsoever either by a word or a beck their Keepers bid them; and so they delude them along thro Towns and Countreys, thro the Streets of the City, even to the very Gates of the Kings <hi>Palace</hi>; Where sometimes they seize upon them by snares, and sometimes by driving them into a kind of Pound, they catch them. After they have brought the Elephant which is not yet caught together with the <hi>She,</hi> into the Kings presence, if it likes him not, he commands to let him go; if it does, he appoints him some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place near unto the City, where they are to drive him with the Females; for without them it is not possible to make him stay; and to keep him in that place until the Kings further order and pleasure is to catch him, which perhaps may not be in two or three or four Years; All which time there are great men with Souldiers appointed to watch there about him: and if he should chance to stray a little out of his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58692:28"/>
bounds set by the King, immediately they bring him back, fearing the Kings displeasure, which is no less than death it self. Here these <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants</hi> do, and may do, great dammage to the Country, by eating up their Corn, and trampling it with their broad feet, and throwing down their <hi>Coker Nut Trees,</hi> and oftentimes their Houses too, and they may not resist them. It is thought this is done by the King to punish them that ly under his displeasure. And if you ask what becomes of these <hi>Elephants</hi> at last; sometimes after they have thus kept watch over them two or three Years, and destroyed the Countrey in this manner, the King will send order to carry them into the Woods, and let them go free. For he catcheth them not for any use or benefit he hath by them, but onely for his recreation and pastime.</p>

For he will do any thing that his Keeper bids him, which is possible for a Beast not having hands to do. And as the <hi>Chingulayes</hi> report, they bear the greatest love to their young of all irrational Creatures; for the Shees are alike tender of any ones young ones as of their own: where there are many <hi>She Elephants</hi> together, the young ones go and suck of any, as well as of their Mothers; and if a young one be in distress and should cry out, they will all in general run to the help and aid thereof; and if they be go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng over a River, as here be some somewhat broad, and the streams run very swift, they will all with their Trunks assist and help to convey the young ones over. They take great delight to ly and tumble in the water, and will swim excellently well. Their Teeth they never shed. Neither will they ever breed tame ones with tame ones; but to ease themselves of the trouble to bring them meat, they will ty their two fore-feet together, and put them into the Woods, where meeting with the wild ones, they conceive and go one Year with young.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The damage they do.</note>It is their constant practice to shove down with their heads great Trees, which they love to eat, when they be too high, and they cannot otherwise reach the boughs. Wild ones will run much faster than a man, but tame ones not. The People stand in fear of them, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are kill'd by them. They do them also great dammage in their Grounds, by Night coming into their Fields and eating up their Corn and likewise their <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So that in Towns near unto the Woods, where are plenty of them, the people are forced to watch their Corn all Night, and also their Outyards and Plantations; into which being once entred with eating and trampling they will do much harm, before they can get them out. Who oftentimes when by light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Torches, and hollowing, they will not go out, take their Bowes and go and shoot them, but not without some hazard, for sometimes the Elephant runs upon them and kills them. For fear of which they will not adventure unless there be Trees, about which they may dodg to defend themselves. And altho here be both <hi>Bears</hi> and <hi>Tygers</hi> in these Woods, yet they are not so fierce, as commonly to assault peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Travellers and Way-faring men go more in fear of <hi>Elephants</hi> than of any other Beasts.</p>

                  <p>At some uncertain seasons the males have an infirmity comes on them,<note place="margin">Their Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> that they will be stark mad, so that none can rule them. Many times it so comes to pass that they with their Keepers on their backs, run raging until they throw them down and kill them: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly there is notice of it before, by an Oyl that will run out of their cheeks, which when that appears, immediately they chain them fast to great Trees by the Legs. For this infirmity they use no Medicine, neither is he sick: but the females are never subject to this.</p>
                  <p>The Keepers of the Kings Elephants sometimes make a sport with them after this manner.<note place="margin">The Sport they make.</note> They will command an Elephant to take up water, which he does, and stands with it in his Trunk, till they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to squirt it out at some body, which he immediately will do, it may be a whole paleful together, and with such a force, that a man can hardly stand against it.</p>
                  <p>There are <hi>Ants</hi> of several sorts,<note place="margin">Ants of divers sorts.</note> and some worthy our remark.</p>
                  <p>First of all, there are the <hi>Coumbias,</hi> a sort of small reddish Ants like ours in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Tale-Coumbias,</hi> as small as the former but blackish. These usually live in hollow Trees or rotten Wood, and will sting most terribly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Dimbios,</hi> great red <hi>Ants.</hi> These make their nests upon the Boughs of great Trees, bringing the Leaves together in clusters, it may be as big as a mans head; in which they lay their Eggs and breed. There will be oftentimes many nests of these upon one Tree, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the people are afraid to go up to gather the Fruits lest they should be stung by them.</p>
                  <p>A fourth sort of <hi>Ants</hi> are those they call <hi>Coura-atch.</hi> They are great and black, living in the ground. Their daily practice is to bring up dirt out of the ground, making great hollow holes in the Earth, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what resembling <hi>Cony-Burrows</hi>; onely these are less, and run strait downwards for some way, and then turn away into divers paths un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground. In many places of the Land there are so many of these holes, that Cattle are ready to break their Legs as they go. These do not sting.</p>
                  <p>A fifth is the <hi>Coddia.</hi> This <hi>Ant</hi> is of an excellent bright black, and as large as any of the former. They dwell always in the ground; and their usual practice is, to be travelling in great multitudes, but I do not know where they are going, nor what their business is; but they pass and repass some forwards and some backwards in great hast, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as full of employment as People that pass along the Streets. These <hi>Ants</hi> will bite desperately, as bad as if a man were burnt with a coal of fire. But they are of a noble nature: for they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; and you may stand by them, if you do not tread upon them nor disturb them. The reason their bite is thus terribly painful is this; Formerly these Ants went to ask a Wife of the <hi>Noya,</hi> a venomous and noble kind of Snake;<note place="margin">How these <hi>Coddia's</hi> come to sting so terribly.</note> and because they had such an high spirit to dare to offer to be related to such a generous creature, they had this vertue bestowed upon them, that they should sting after this manner. And if they had obtained a Wife of the <hi>Noya,</hi> they should have had the priviledg to have stung full as bad as he. This is a currant Fable among
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:58692:30"/>
the <hi>Chingulays.</hi> Tho undoubtedly they chiefly regard the wisedom that is concealed under this, and the rest of their Fables.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">These Ants a very mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous sort.</note> There is a sixth sort called <hi>Vaeos.</hi> These are more numerous than any of the former. All the whole Earth doth swarm with them. They are of a middle size between the greatest and the least, the hinder part white, and the head red. They eat and devour all that they can come at; as besides food, Cloth, Wood, Thatch of Houses and every thing excepting Iron and Stone. So that the people cannot set any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground within their houses for them. They creep up the walls of their houses, and build an <hi>Arch</hi> made of dirt over themselves all the way as they climb, be it never so high. And if this <hi>Arch</hi> or Vault chance to be broken, they all, how high soever they were, come back again to mend up the breach, which being finished they proceed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards again, eating every thing they come at in their way. This Vermin does exceedingly annoy the <hi>Chingulays,</hi> insomuch that they are continually looking upon any thing they value, to see if any of these <hi>Vaeos</hi> have been at it. Which they may easily perceive by this <hi>Case</hi> of dirt, which they cannot go up any where without building as they go. And wheresoever this is seen, no doubt the <hi>Ants</hi> are there.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The curious Buildings of the <hi>Vaeos.</hi>
                     </note>In places where there are no houses, and they can eat nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the people, they will raise great Hills like <hi>Butts,</hi> some four or five or six foot high; which are so hard and strong, that it would be work enough to dig them down with Pick-Axes. The <hi>Chingulays</hi> call these <hi>Humbosses.</hi> Within they are full of hollow Vaults and Arches where they dwell and breed, and their nests are much like to Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs, full of eggs and young ones. These <hi>Humbosses</hi> are built with a pure refined Clay by the ingenious builders. The people use this Clay to make their Earthen Gods of, because it is so pure and fine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The manner of their death.</note>This sort of creatures as they increase in multitudes, so they dy in multitudes also. For when they come to maturity they have wings and in the Evening after the going down of the Sun, (never before) all those that are fledged and ripe, will issue forth in such vast numbers, that they do almost darken the Sky, flying to such an height, as they go out of sight, and so keep flying till they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The People in this Land never feed their <hi>Poultry.</hi> But they feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these <hi>Ants,</hi> which by scraping among the leaves and dirt they can never want; and they delight in them above Rice or any thing else. Besides all these Ants already mentioned, there are divers other distinct sorts of them.</p>

Into which holes the men blow with their mouths, and the Bees presently fly out. And then they put in their hands, and pull out the Combs, which they put in Pots or Vessels, and carry away. They are not afraid of their stinging in the least, nor do they arm themselves with any cloths against them.</p>

generally of a great height. At time of year whole Towns, forty or fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty in company together will go out into the Woods, and gather this honey, and come home laden with it for their use.</p>
                  <p>The third sort they call <hi>Connameia,</hi> signifying a blind Bee. They are small like a Fly, and black. They build in hollow Trees; and their honey somewhat tarrish: and they make such small quantities of it, that the people little regard it. The Boyes will sometimes cut a hole and take it out.</p>
                  <p>When they meet with any swarms of Bees hanging on any Tree,<note place="margin">The people eat the Bees, as well as their honey.</note> they will hold Torches under to make them drop; and so catch them and carry them home. Which they boyl and eat, and esteem excellent food.</p>
                  <p>There is a sort of <hi>Leaches</hi> of the nature of ours,<note place="margin">Leaches that ly in the grass, and creep on Travellers Legs.</note> onely differing in colour and bigness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> For they are of a dark reddish colour like the skin of Bacon, and as big as a Goose quill, in length some two or three inches. At first, when they are young, they are no bigger than a horse hair, so that they can scarce be seen. In dry weather none of them appear, but immediately upon the fall of Rains, the Grass and Woods are full of them. These <hi>Leaches</hi> seize upon the Legs of Travellers; who going barefoot according to the custom of that Land, have them hanging upon their Legs in multitudes, which suck their blood till their bellies are full, and then drop off. They come in such quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that the people cannot pull them off so fast as they crawl on. The blood runs pouring down their Legs all the way they go, and 'tis no little smart neither, so that they would willingly be without them if they could, especially those that have sores on their Legs; for they all gather to the sore.</p>
                  <p>Some therefore will tie a piece of <hi>Lemon</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> in a rag and fasten it unto a stick,<note place="margin">The remedies they use against them.</note> and ever and anon strike it upon their Legs to make the Leaches drop off: others will scrape them off with a reed cut flat and sharp in the fashion of a knife. But this is so troublesom, and they come on again so fast and so numerous, that it is not worth their while: and generally they suffer them to bite and remain on their Legs during their Iourney; and they do the more patiently permit them, because it is so wholsome for them. When they come to their Iourneys end they rub all their Legs with ashes, and so clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of them at once: but still the blood will remain dropping a great while after. But they are most annoyed by them when they go out to stool a-Nights, being small and of the colour of their bodies, so that they can neither see nor feel to pull them off. And these, tho they be in such quantities in some of these Countreys, yet in others there are none at all, nor ever were known to have been. But besides these, there are <hi>Water Leaches</hi> the same with ours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monkeys.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apes and Monkeys of divers kinds.</note> Of which there are abundance in the Woods, and of divers sorts, some so large as our <hi>English Spaniel Dogs,</hi> of a darkish gray co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and black faces, with great white beards round from ear to ear, which makes them shew just like old men. There is another sort just of the same bigness, but differ in colour, being milk white both in body and face, having great beards like the others; of this sort of white ones there is not such plenty. But both these sorts do but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle mischief, keeping in the Woods, eating onely leaves and buds of Trees, but when they are catched, they will eat any thing. This sort

This sort of <hi>Monkeys</hi> have no beards, white faces, and long hair on the top of their heads, which part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and hangeth down like a mans. These are so impudent that they will come into their Gardens, and eat such Fruit as grows there.

They have a basket made with canes somewhat like unto a funnel, in which they put a potsheard with fire in it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a certain wood, which they have growing there, full of sap like pitch, and that will burn like a pitch-barrel. This being kindled in the potsheard flames, and gives an exceeding light. They carry it upon their heads with the flame foremost; the basket hiding him that is under it, and those that come behind it. In their hands they carry three or four small bells, which they tingle as they go, that the noyse of their steps should not be heard. Behind the man that carries the light, go men with Bowes and Arrows. And so they go walking along the Plains, and by the Pond sides, where they think the <hi>Deer</hi> will come out to feed. Which when they see the light, stand still and stare upon it, seeing onely the light, and hearing nothing but the tingling of the bells.</p>
                  <p>The eyes of the <hi>Deer</hi> or other Cattle first appear to them glistering like Stars of light or Diamonds: and by their long experience they will distinguish one Beast from another by their eyes. All Creatures, as Deer, Hares, Elephants, Bears, &amp;c. excepting onely wild Hogs, will stand still, wondering at this strange sight, till the people come as near as they do desire, and so let fly their Arrows upon them. And by this means they seldom go, but they catch something. The blades of their hunting-Arrowes are at least a foot or a foot and an half long<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If a <hi>Tyger</hi> chance to come into their Grounds and kill a <hi>Cow,</hi> they will take notice of the place thro which he passed, and set a Cross-bow there ready charged.

                  <head>CHAP. VII. Of their Birds, Fish, Serpents, Commodities.</head>
                  <p>IN the next place I will entertain you with some relation of the other living Creatures among them.<note place="margin">Their Birds.</note> I begin with their <hi>Birds.</hi> In that Land there are <hi>Crowes, Sparrowes, Tom-titts, Snipes,</hi> just like these in <hi>England, Wood-Pigeons</hi> also, but not great flocks of any sorts, as we have, onely of <hi>Crowes</hi> and <hi>Pigeons.</hi> I have seen there Birds just like <hi>Woodcocks</hi> and <hi>Partridges,</hi> but they are scarce. A great many wild <hi>Peacocks</hi>: small green <hi>Parrots,</hi> but not very good to talk. But here is another Bird in their Language called <hi>Mal-cowda,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Such as will be taught to speak.</note> which with teaching will speak excellently well. It is black with yellow gills about the bigness of a <hi>Black-Bird</hi>: And another sort there is of the same bigness, called <hi>Cau-cowda,</hi> yellow like gold, very beautiful to the eye, which also might be taught to speak.</p>
                  <p>Here are other sorts of small Birds, not much bigger than a <hi>Sparrow,</hi> very lovely to look on, but I think good for nothing else: some being in colour white like Snow,<note place="margin">Such as are beautiful fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oot in length, and their heads black like jet, with a tuft like a plume of Feathers standing upright thereon. There are others of the same sort onely differing in colour, being reddish like a ripe <hi>Orange,</hi> and on the head a Plume of black Feathers standing up. I suppose, one may be the <hi>Cock,</hi> and the other the <hi>Hen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:58692:33"/>Here is a sort of Bird they call <hi>Carlo,</hi> which never lighteth on the ground, but always sets on very high Trees. He is as big as a <hi>Swan,</hi> the colour black,<note place="margin">A strange Bird.</note> the Legs very short, the Head monstrous, his Bill very long, a little rounding like a <hi>Hawks,</hi> and white on each side of the head, like ears: on the top of the crown groweth out a white thing, somewhat like to the comb of a Cock; commonly they keep four or five of them together; and always are hopping from bough to bough; They are seldom silent, but continually make a roaring noyse, somewhat like the quacking of a Duck, that they may be heard at least a mile off; the reason they thus cry, the <hi>Chingulayes</hi> say, is for Rain, that they may drink. The bodies of these Fowls are good to eat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Water-Fowls resembling Ducks and Swans.</note>Here is a sort of Bird very much resembling a <hi>Duck,</hi> but not very plentiful. And another sort of Fowl as big as a <hi>Duck,</hi> cole black, which liveth altogether upon Fish. It is admirable to see, how long they will remain under water, and at what a distance they will rise again. Besides these, there are many other kinds of Birds, much larger than <hi>Swans,</hi> which keep about the Ponds and Marshes to catch Fish, but the people eat them not: Nature hath endowed them with an admirable understanding, that they are not to be catched by the <hi>Allegators,</hi> tho there be many of them in those waters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Peacocks.</note>The <hi>Peacocks</hi> in rainy weather are sometimes hunted and caught by Dogs; for their Feathers being wet, they are uncapable of flying far.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The King keeps Fowl.</note>The King hath <hi>Geese, Ducks, Turkeys, Pigeons,</hi> which he keeps tame, but none else may. <hi>Turkeys</hi> he delights not in, because they change the colour of their heads: Neither doth he kill any of these to eat, nor any other creature of what sort soever, and he hath many, that he keeps tame.</p>

Then they put in their hands and take them out. And rieve a Rattan thro their gills, and so let them drag after them. One end of this Rattan is stuck in the fisher's girdle, and the other knotted, that the fish should not slip off: which when it is full, he discharges himself of them by carrying them ashore. Nay every ditch and little plash of water but anckle deep hath fish in it.</p>
                  <p>The great River, <hi>Mavela-gonga,</hi> abounds exceedingly with them. Some of them as big as <hi>Salmons.</hi> But the people have little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the way of taking them. In very dry weather, they stretch a <hi>With</hi> over the River,<note place="margin">How they catch Fish in the River.</note> which they hang all full of boughs of Trees to scare the Fish.

In many other places also there are Fish thus fed and kept onely for the Kings Recreation: for he will nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Of <hi>Serpents,</hi> there are these sorts. The <hi>Pimberah,</hi>

The <hi>Pimberah</hi> of a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bigness.</note> the body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is as big as a mans middle, and of a length proportionable. It is not swift, but by subtilty will catch his prey; which are <hi>Deer</hi> or other Cattel; He lyes in the path where the Deer use to pass, and as they go, he claps hold of them by a kind of peg that growes in his tayl, with which he strikes them. He will swallow a Roe Buck whole, horns and all; so that it happens sometimes the horns run thro his belly, and kill him. A <hi>Stag</hi> was caught by one of these <hi>Pimberahs,</hi> which seised him by the buttock, and held him so fast, that he could not get away, but ran a few steps this way and that way. An <hi>Indian</hi> seeing the Stag run thus, supposed him in a snare, and having a Gun shot him; at which he gave so strong a jerk, that it pulled the Serpents head off, while his tayl was encompassing a Tree to hold the Stag the better.</p>
                  <p>There is another venomous Snake called <hi>Polongo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Polong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> the most veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous of all, that kills Cattel. Two sorts of them I have seen, the one green, the other of a reddish gray, full of white rings along the sides, and about five or six foot long.</p>
                  <p>Another poysonous Snake there is called <hi>Noya,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Noya.</hi>
                     </note> of a grayish colour, about four foot long. This will stand with half his body upright two or three hours together, and spread his head broad open, where there appears like as it were a pair of spectacles painted on it. The <hi>Indians</hi> call this <hi>Noy-Rogerati,</hi> that is, a <hi>Kings-Snake,</hi> that will do no harm. But if the <hi>Polonga</hi> and the <hi>Noya</hi> meet together, they cease not fighting till one hath kill'd the other.</p>
                  <p>The reason and original of this fatal enmity between these two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,<note place="margin">The Fable of the <hi>Noya</hi> and <hi>Polonga.</hi>
                     </note> is this, according to a Fable among the <hi>Chingulays.</hi> These two chanced to meet in a dry S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ason, when water was scarce. The <hi>Polonga</hi> being almost famished for thirst, asked the <hi>Noya,</hi> where he might go to find a little water. The <hi>Noya</hi> a little before had met with a bowl of water in which a Child lay playing. As it is usual among this people to wash their Children in a bowl of water, and there leave them to tumble and play in it. Here the <hi>Noya</hi> quenched his thirst, but as he was drinking, the Child that lay in the bowl, out of his innocency and play, hit him on the Head with his hand, which the <hi>Noya</hi> made no matter of, but bare patiently, knowing it was not done out of any malice: and having drunk as much as sufficed him, went away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing the Child any harm.</p>
                  <p>Being minded to direct the <hi>Polonga</hi> to this bowl, but desirous withal to preserve the Child, he told him, That he knew of water, but that he was such a surly hasty creature, that he was fearful to let him know where it was, lest he might do some mischief; Making him therefore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58692:35"/>
promise that he would not, he then told him, that at such a place there was a bowl of water with a Child playing in it, and that probably the Child might, as he was tumbling give him a pat on the Head, as he had done to him before, but charged him nevertheless not to hurt the Child, Which the <hi>Polonga</hi> having promised went his way towards the water, as the <hi>Noya</hi> had directed him. The <hi>Noya</hi> knowing his touchy disposition, went after him, fearing he might do the Child a mischief, and that thereby he himself might be deprived of the like benefit afterwards. It fell out as he feared. For as the <hi>Polonga</hi> drank, the Child patted him on the head, and he in his hasty humour bit him on the hand and killed him. The <hi>Noya</hi> seeing this, was resolved to be revenged; and so reproaching him for his baseness, fought him so long till he killed him, and after that devoured him: Which to this day they ever do, always fight when they meet, and the Conquerour eats the the body of the vanquished. Hence the Proverb among the <hi>Chingulayes,</hi> when they see two men irreconcileable, they compare them to the <hi>Polonga</hi> and <hi>Noya,</hi> and say, <hi>Noya Polonga waghe, like a Noya and Polonga.</hi>

And here Order will lead us to speak first of the King and Matters relating to him.</p>
                  <p>Antiently this Countrey consisted of Nine Kingdoms, all which had their several Kings; but now by the vicissitude of Times and Things, they are all reduced under one King, who is an absolute <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and Rules the most arbitrarily of any King in the World. We will first speak of him as to his <hi>Personal Capacity,</hi> and next as to his <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical.</hi>

                     <hi>Radga-Singa</hi> is his Name, which signifies a <hi>Lyon-King.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The King's Lincage.</note> He is not of the right Descent of the <hi>Royal-Blood.</hi> For the former King deceased leaving his Queen a Widow, and two young Princes, which he had issue by her. She was a <hi>Christian,</hi> having been baptized by the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guez,</hi> and named <hi>Dona Catharina.</hi> She afterwards married to the <hi>Chief Priest,</hi> whom in their Language they call <hi>Tirinanxy.</hi> And by him had this Son, the present King. The <hi>Tirinanx</hi> his Father reigned and ruled the Land during the minority of the young Princes: but being aged, he divided the Countrey between the three Princes by Lot, intending <hi>Conde Vda,</hi> which is the best part of the Land, for his own Son, <hi>Radga-Singa.</hi> Which was obtained by this device. The names of the three Kingdoms being written on three Papers, were put into a Pot, and one was appointed, who knew the matter to take them out, and deliver them one to each, beginning with the Eldest, craftily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering that which had <hi>Conde Vda</hi> written in it unto <hi>Radga-Singa</hi>; and so it came to pass according to the old Kings determination. All these three in the beginning of their Reigns joyned together against the <hi>Portuguez,</hi> but soon after fell out among themselves, and this King in the end prevailed, and got all the Countrey. <hi>Danna Polla Rodgerah</hi> the youngest, King of <hi>Mautoly,</hi> being overthrown, fled down to the <hi>Portuguez</hi> to <hi>Columba,</hi> who sent him to <hi>Goa,</hi> where he dyed.

For when the King is displeased with any, he does not alwayes command to kill them outright, but first to torment them, which is done by cutting and pulling away their flesh by Pincers, burning them with hot Irons clapped to them to make them confess of their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates; and this they do, to rid themselves of their Torments, confessing far more than ever they saw or knew. After their Confession, sometimes he commands to hang their two Hands about their Necks, and to make them eat their own flesh, and their own Mothers to eat of their own Children; and so to lead them thro the City in public view to terrifie all, unto the place of Execution, the Dogs following to eat them.<note place="margin">The Dogs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Prisoners to execution.</note> For they are so accustomed to it, that they seeing a Prisoner led away, follow after.

It is according as the King appoints, when they are committed. Or some of them being driven to want do get food by work, such as, sewing, making Caps, Doublets, Purses. This coming once to the Kings Ears, he said, <hi>I put them there to torment and punish them, not to work and be well maintained</hi>; and so commanded to take away their Sizzars and Needles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When the Streets are to be swept about the Palace, they make the Prisoners come out in their Chains, and do it.</p>
                  <p>And after all their Imprisonment, without any examination, they are carried forth and executed: and these not only the common sort, but even the greatest and most nobly descended in the Land: For with whom he is displeased, he maketh no difference.</p>

Heretofore, as it is reported, he was not so Cruel, but now none escapes, that serves in his Palace. Then he recruits his Slain out of the Countries, by giving Orders to his <hi>Dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi>'s or <hi>Governors</hi> to send him others to Court. Whither they go like an Ox to the Slaughter, but with far more heavy hearts. For both they and their Parents full well know what end the King's honorable Service will bring them to. Howbeit there is no remedy. Being thus by Order sent unto the Court, their own Parents must provide for and maintain them, until the King is pleased to call them to his Use, which it may be will not be in some years. Sometimes it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the Boys thus brought, before the King makes use of them about his Person, are grown too big, and so escape. But those that are employed in the Palace, enjoy this favour, That all such Taxes, Customs, or other Duties belonging to the King, which their Fathers were wont to pay, are released, until such time as they are discharged from the King's Employment; which is always either by Execution, or by being given to somebody for perpetual Bondmen. During the time of the King's favour, he is never admitted to go home to Visit his Parents and Friends. The Malekind may come to see him, but no Women are admitted, be it his Mother that bare him. And after he is killed, tho' for what no man knows, he is accounted a <hi>Rebel</hi> and <hi>Traitor</hi> against the King: and then his Father's House, Land and Estate is seized on for the King.

It is now become a fine Pond, and exceeding full of Fish. At this Place the King hath several Houses built according to his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very handsom, born up with carved Pillars and Painted, and round about Rails and Banisters turned, one Painted and one Ebony, like Balconie. Some standing high upon a Wall, being for him to sit in, and see Sport with his Elephants, and other Beasts, as also for a Prospect abroad. Others standing over this Pond, where he himself sits and feedeth his Fish with boiled Rice, Fruits and Sweet-meats. They are so tame that they will come and eat in his hand; but never doth he suffer any to be catch'd. This Pond is useful for his Elephants to wash in. The Plain was made for his Horses to run upon. For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he commands his Grooms to get up and ride in his Presence; and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58692:43"/>
sometimes for that good Service, gives the Rider five or ten <hi>Shillings,</hi> and it may be a piece of Cloath. Always when he comes forth, his Horses are brought out ready saddled before him; but he himself mounts them very seldom. All of which he had from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> some sent to him for <hi>Presents,</hi> and some he hath taken in War. He hath in all some twelve or fourteen: some of which are <hi>Persian</hi> Horses.</p>

As to make them bring wild Elephants out of the Woods, and catch them in his Presence. The manner how they get them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, I have mentioned already. Also when he comes out of his Court, he Delights to look upon his <hi>Hawks,</hi> altho' he never use them for his Game; sometimes on his Dogs, and tame Deer, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and strange kind of Birds and Beasts; of both which he hath a great many. Also he will try his Guns, and shoot at Marks, which are excellently true, and rarely inlay'd with Silver, Gold, and Ivory. For the <hi>Smiths</hi> that make them dare not present them to his hand, not having sufficiently proved them. He hath Eight or Nine small Iron <hi>Cannon,</hi> lately taken from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which he hath mounted in Field-Carriages, all rarely carved, and inlay'd with Silver and Brass, and coloured Stones, set in convenient places, and painted with Images and Flowers. But the Guns disgrace the Carriages. He keeps them in an House on the Plain. Upon some Festival times he useth them. I think, they are set there chiefly for a Memorial of his late Victories: For he hath many, and far better Guns of <hi>Brass</hi> that are not so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>

                  <p>Many Towns are in the King's hand, the Inhabitants whereof are to Till and Manure a quantity of the Land according to their Ability, and lay up the Corn for the King's use.

At such times the Soldiers must lay by their Swords, and work among the People. These works are either digging down Hills, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earth to fill up Valleys; thus to enlarge his Court, which standeth between two Hills, (a more uneven and unhandsom spot of ground, he could not well have found in all his Kingdom); or else making ways for the Water to run into the Pond, and elsewhere for his use in his Palace.

                     <note place="margin">A vast work undertaken and finished by the King.</note>To bring this Water to his Palace, was no small deal of labour.

Which at first being only Earth, the Water would often break down; but now both bottom and sides are paved and wrought up with Stone. After all this, yet it was at least four or five Miles to bring this Water in a Ditch; and the ground all Hills and Valleys, so that they were forced to turn and

their usual practice is to way lay them, and stop up the wayes before them: there being convenient places in all the Roads, which they have contrived for such purposes. And at these places the Woods are not suffered to be felled, but kept to shelter them from the sight of their enemies. Here they lye lurking, and plant their Guns between the Rocks and Trees, with which they do great damage to their Enemies before they are aware. Nor can they then suddenly rush in upon them, being so well guarded with Bushes and Rocks before them, thro which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Being sent upon any design they are very circumspect to keep it hidden from the Enemies knowledg; by suffering only those to pass, who may make for their Benefit and advantage; their great endeavour being to take their Enemies unprovided and at unawares.</p>

                     <note place="margin">A Comet ush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in the Rebellion.</note>FOr the Conclusion of this Part, it will not be improper to relate here a dangerous rising of the People against the King. It happened in the year 1664. About which time appeared a fearful <hi>Blazing-Star.</hi> Iust at the Instant of the Rebellion, the Star was right over our heads. And one thing I very much wondred, at, which was that whereas before this Rebellion, the Tail stood away toward the <hi>Westward</hi> from which side the Rebellion sprung, the very night after (for I very well observed it) the Tail was turned and stood away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Eastward.</hi> And by degrees it diminished quite away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The intent of the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators.</note>At this time, I say, the people of this land, having been long and sore oppressed by this Kings unreasonable and cruel Government, had contrived a Plot against him. Which was to assault the Kings Court in the night, and to slay him, and to make the Prince his Son, King. He being then some twelve or fifteen years of age, who was then with his Mother the Queen in the City o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Cande.</hi> At this time the King held his Court in a City called <hi>Nillemby.</hi> The Situation of which is far inferior to that of <hi>Cande,</hi> and as far beyond that of <hi>Digligy</hi> where he now is. <hi>Nillemby</hi> lyeth some fourteen miles southward of the City of <hi>Cande.</hi> In the place where this City stands it is reported by Tradition an <hi>Hare</hi> gave chase after a Dog, upon which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that place was fortunate, and so indeed it proved to the King. It is invironed with Hills and Woods.</p>
                  <p>The time appointed to put their design in action was the one and twentieth of <hi>December</hi> 1664. about <hi>Twelve</hi> in the night.<note place="margin">How the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion began.</note> And having gotten a select company of men, how many well I know not, but as is supposed, not above two hundred, neither needed they many here, having so many Confederates in the Court; in the dead of the night they came marching into the City. The <hi>Watch</hi> was thought to be of their confedracy: but if he were not, it was not in his power to resist them. Howbeit afterwards, whether he were not, he was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it. The said men, being thus in the City, hastened and came down to the Court; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aid without the Palace upon Watch: since which by the Kings order they lye allways within the Palace. For they were well informed before who were for them and who not. Many who before were not intrusted to know of their design, were killed and wounded; and those that could, seeing the slaughter of others, got in unto the King.<note place="margin">The King Flyes.</note> Who was walled about with a <hi>Clay-wall,</hi> thatched: that was all his strength. Yet these people feared to assault him, laying still until the morning. At which time the King made way to flee, fearing to stay in his Palace, endeavouring to get unto the mountains, and had not with him above fifty persons. There were horses went with him, but the wayes were so bad, that he could not ride. They were fain to drive an Elephant before him, to break the way through the Woods, that the King with his followers might pass.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:58692:51"/>As he fled they pursued him, but at a great distance, fearing to approach within shot of him. For he wanted not for excellent good <hi>Fowling pieces,</hi> which are made there.<note place="margin">They pursue him faintly.</note> So he got safe upon a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, called <hi>Gauluda,</hi> some fifteen miles distant, where many of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, that were near, resorted to him. Howbeit had the people of the Rebel-party been resolute, who were the major part (almost all the Land;) this Hill could not have secured him, but they might have driven him from thence; there being many ways by which they might have ascended. There is not far from thence a high and peak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hill called <hi>Mondamounour,</hi> where there is but one way to get up, and that very steep, at the top are great stones hanging in chains to let fall when need requireth. Had he fled hither, there had been no way to come at him. But he never will adventure to go, where he may be stopped in.</p>
                  <p>The People having thus driven away the old King,<note place="margin">They go to the Prince and Proclaim him King.</note> marched away to the City of <hi>Cande,</hi> and proclaimed the Prince, <hi>King:</hi> giving out to us <hi>English</hi> who were there, that what they had done they had not done rashly, but upon good Consideration, and with good advice; the King by his evil Government having occasioned it, who went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to destroy both them and their Countrey: As in keeping Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours, disanulling of Trade, detaining of all people that come upon his Land, and killing of his Subjects and their Children, and not suffering them to enjoy nor to see their Wives. And all this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reason, and as, they were informed, to the Government of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries.</p>
                  <p>The Prince being young and tender,<note place="margin">The carriage of the Prince.</note> and having never been out of the Palace, nor ever seen any but those that attended on his person, as it seemed afterwards, was scared to see so many coming and bowing down to him, and telling him that he was <hi>King,</hi> and his Father was fled into the mountains. Neither did he say or act any thing, as not owning the business, or else not knowing what to say or do. This much discouraged the Rebells, to see they had no more thanks for their pains. And so all things stood until the five and twentieth of <hi>December,</hi> at which time they intended to march and fall upon the old King.</p>
                  <p>But in the Interim, the Kings Sister Flyes away with the Prince from the Court into the Countrey near unto the King;<note place="margin">Upon the Princes Flight, the Rebells scatter and run.</note> which so amazed the Rebells, that the mony and cloth and plunder which they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and were going to distribute to the <hi>Strangers</hi> to gain their good will and assistance, they scattered about and fled. Others of their Company seeing the Business was overthrown, to make amends for their former fact, turned and fell upon their Consorts, killing and taking Prisoners all they could. The people were now all up in arms one against another, killing whom they pleas'd, only saying they were <hi>Rebells</hi> and taking their goods.</p>
                  <p>By this time a great man had drawn out his men, and stood in the Field, and there turned and publickly declared for the old King:<note place="margin">A great man declares for the King.</note> and so went to catch the Rebells that were scattered abroad. Who when he understood that they were all fled, and no whole party or body left to resist him, marched into the City killing all that he could catch.</p>
                  <p>And so all revolted, and came back to the King again: whilst he only lay still upon his mountain.<note place="margin">For eight or ten days no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves good Subjects.</note> The King needed not to take care to catch or execute the Rebells, for they themselves out of their zeal
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58692:52"/>
to him, and to make amends for what was past, imprisoned and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all they met; the Plunder being their own. This continued for some eight or ten days. Which the King hearing of, commanded to kill no more, but that whom they took they should imprison, until examination passed; which was not so much to save innocent persons from violence, as that he might have the Rebells to torment them, and make them confess of their Confederates. For he spared none that seemed guilty: some to this day lye chained in Prison, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>eque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred of all their Estates, and beg for their living. One of the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Rebells, called <hi>Ambom Wellaraul,</hi> he sent to <hi>Columba</hi> to the <hi>Dutch</hi> to execute, supposing they would invent new Tortures for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what he knew of. But they instead of executing him, cut off his chains, and kindly entertained him, and there he still is in the City of <hi>Columba,</hi> reserving him for some designs they may hereafter have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The King could but not be sensible, that it was his rigorous govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that had occasioned this Rebellion,<note place="margin">The King poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons his Son to prevent a Rebellion hereafter.</note> yet amended it not in the least; but on the contrary like to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> added yet more to the Peoples yoak. And being thus safely re-instated in his Kingdom again, and observing that the life of his Son gave encouragement to the Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, resolved to prevent it for the future by taking him away. Which upon the next opportunity he did by Poysoning him, which I have related before.</p>
                  <p>But one thing there is, that argues him guilty of imprudence and horrible ingratitude,<note place="margin">His ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> that most of those that went along with him when he fled, of whose <hi>Loyalty</hi> he had such ample experience, he hath since cut off; and that with extreme cruelty too.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1666 in the month of <hi>February,</hi> there appeared in this Countrey another <hi>Comet</hi> or stream in the West,<note place="margin">Another <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any bad effects follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</note> the head end under the <hi>Horizon,</hi> much resembling that which was seen in <hi>England</hi> in the year 1680 in <hi>December.</hi> The sight of this did much daunt both King and People, having but a year or two before felt the sad event of a <hi>Blazing-Star</hi> in this Rebellion which I have now related. The King sent men upon the highest mountains in the Land to look if they could perceive the head of it, which they could not, being still under the <hi>Horizon.</hi> This continued visible about the space of one month, and by that time it was so diminished, that it could not be seen. But there were no remarkable passages that ensued upon it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. Concerning the Inhabitants of this Island.</head>
                  <p>WEE shall in this <hi>Part</hi> speak of the Inhabitants of this Countrey, with their <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Customs,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things belonging to them.</p>
                  <p>Besides the <hi>Dutch</hi> who possess, as I judg, about one fourth of the Island,<note place="margin">The several Inhabitants of this Island.</note> there are <hi>Malabars,</hi> that are <hi>free Denizons,</hi> and pay duty to the King for the Land they enjoy, as the Kings natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects do; there are also <hi>Moors,</hi> who are like Strangers, and hold no Land, but live by carrying goods to the Sea-Ports, which now are in the <hi>Hollanders</hi> hands. The Sea-Ports are inhabited by a mixt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Malabars</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> and some that are <hi>black,</hi> who profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and wear <hi>Crosses,</hi> and use <hi>Beads.</hi> Some of these are under the <hi>Hollander</hi>; and pay toll and tribute to them.</p>
                  <p>But I am to speak only of the natural proper People of the Island, which they call <hi>Chingulays.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have asked them, whence they derive themselves, but they could not tell. They say their Land was first inhabited by <hi>Devils,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Original of <hi>Chinguluys.</hi>
                     </note> of which they have a long Fable. I have heard a tradition from some <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> here, which was; That an antient King of <hi>China</hi> had a Son, who during his Fathers Reign, proved so very harsh and cruel unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they being afraid he might prove a Tyrant if he came to the Crown, desired the King to banish him, and that he might never succeed. This that King, to please the people, granted. And so put him with certain Attendants into a ship, and turned them forth unto the Winds to seek their fortune. The first shore they were cast upon, was this Island. Which they seated themselves on, and peopled it. But to me nothing is more improbable than this Story. Because this people and the <hi>Chineses</hi> have no agreement nor similitude in their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures nor language nor diet. It is more probable, they came from the <hi>Malabars,</hi> their Countrey lying next, tho they do resemble them lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing. I know no nation in the world do so exactly resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the <hi>Chingulays</hi> as the people of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of these <hi>Natives</hi> there be two sorts, <hi>Wild</hi> and <hi>Tame.</hi> I will begin with the former. For as in these Woods there are Wild <hi>Beasts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wild-men.</note> so Wild <hi>Men</hi> also.

But the <hi>Hondrews</hi> will not eat with them: however in Apparel there is no difference; and they are also privileged to sit on Stools, which none of the Inferior ranks of People hereafter mentioned, may do. Heretofore they were accounted almost equal to the Inferior sort of <hi>Hondrewes,</hi> and they would eat in these Artificers Houses, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they were degraded upon this occasion. It chanced some <hi>Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews</hi> came to a <hi>Smith</hi>'s <hi>Shop</hi> to have their Tools mended, when it came to be Dinner time, the Smith leaves work, and goes in to his House to dine, leaving the <hi>Hondrewes</hi> in his Shop: who had waited there a great while to have their work done. Now whether the Smith fearing lest their hunger might move them to be so impudent or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate as to partake with him of his Dinner, clapt to his Door after him: Which was taken so hainously by those hungry People in his Shop, that immediately they all went and declared abroad what an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the Smith had put upon them. Whereupon it was decreed and confirmed, that for ever after all the People of that rank should be deposed, and deprived of the Honour of having the <hi>Hondrewes</hi> to eat in their Houses. VVhich Decree hath stood in force ever since.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless these <hi>Smiths</hi> take much upon them,<note place="margin">The Privilege and state of the Smiths.</note> especially those who are the King's <hi>Smiths</hi>; that is, such who live in the King's Towns, and do his work. These have this Privilege, that each has a parcel of Towns belonging to them, whom none but they are to work for. The
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58692:57"/>
ordinary work they do for them is mending their Tools, for which every Man pays to his Smith a certain Rate of Corn in Harvest time according to ancient Custom. But if any hath work extraordinary, as making new Tools or the like, besides the aforesaid Rate of Corn, he must pay him for it. In order to this, they come in an humble manner to the Smith with a Present, being Rice, Hens, and other sorts of Provision, or a Bottle of Rack, desiring him to appoint his time, when they shall come to have their work done. VVhich when he hath appointed them, they come at the set time, and bring both Coals and Iron with them. The Smith sits very gravely upon his Stool, his Anvil before him, with his left hand towards the Forge, and a little Hammer in his Right. They themselves who come with their work must blow the Bellows, and when the Iron is to be beaten with the great Maul, he holds it, still sitting upon his Stool, and they must hammer it themselves, he only with his little Hammer knocking it sometimes into fashion. And if it be any thing to be filed, he makes them go themselves and grind it upon a Stone, that his labour of file<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be the less; and when they have done it as well as they can, he goes over it again with his file and finisheth it. That which makes these <hi>Smiths</hi> thus stately is, because the Towns People are compelled to go to their own Smith, and none else. And if they should, that Smith is liable to pay Dammages that should do work for any in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Smith's Iurisdiction.</p>

                     <hi>WEdnesdays</hi> and <hi>Saturdays</hi> are the days, when people, who have any business with the Gods, come and address them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; that is either to pray to their God for health, or for their help in some weighty matters, as in War &amp;c. or to swear concerning any matter in controversy, which is done before the Idols.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How they know what God or Devil hath made them sick.</note>But one of their great and frequent businesses with their Gods is for the Recovery of health. And that God or Devil that hath made them sick, in his power only it is to restore them. Therefore when they feel themselves sick or sore, first, they use means to know which God or Devil hath been the cause or author thereof. Which to find they use these means. With any little stick they make a bow, and on the string thereof they hang a thing they have to cut <hi>Betel-nuts,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like a pair of Sizzars; then holding the stick or Bow by both ends, they repeat the names of all both God and Devils: and when they come to him who hath afflicted them, then the Iron on the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string will swing. They say by that sign they know their ilness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the power of that God last named; but I think this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by the power of the Hands that hold it. The God being thus found, to him chiefly they offer their oblations and sacrifices.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Gods of their fortunes.</note>There are nine <hi>Deities,</hi> which they call <hi>Gerehah,</hi> which are the <hi>Planets</hi> (reckoning in probably the <hi>Dragons head</hi> and <hi>Tail.</hi>) From whom proceed their <hi>Fortunes.</hi> These they reckon so powerful, that if they be ill affected towards any party, neither God nor Devil can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship they give the Planets.</note>When they are disposed to worship these <hi>Gerehah,</hi> they make Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Clay according to the number that stand disaffected, towards them, which by certain Magick Tricks they know these Images, which are made by the Weavers, they paint of divers colours, of horrible and monstrous shapes; some with long tusks like a Boar, some with hornes like a Bull, all in a most deformed manner, but something re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the shape of a man. Before them they prostrate Victuals, the sick party sitting all the while before them. These ceremonies are always celebrated in the night with Drums and Pipes and dancing until almost day, and then they take these Images and cast them out into the high ways to be trampled under foot: and the Victuals taken away and eaten by the attendants, and despicable people that wai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:58692:62"/>When they worship those whom they call <hi>Devils,</hi> many of whom they hold to be the Spirits of some that died heretofore, they make no Images for them, as they did for the <hi>Planets</hi>;<note place="margin">What worship they give De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</note> but only build a new house in their yard, like a Barn very slight, covered only with leaves, and adorn it with Branches and Flowers. Into this House they bring some of the Weapons or Instruments, which are in the Pagods or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and place them on Stools at one end of the house, which is hanged with Cloth for that purpose, and before them on other Stools they lay Victuals: and all that time of the Sacrifice there is Drumming, Piping, Singing, and Dancing.<note place="margin">Who eat the Sacrifices.</note> Which being ended, they take the Victuals away, and give it to those which Drum and Pipe, with other Beggars and Vagabonds; for only such do eat of their Sacrifices; not that they do account such things hallowed, and so dare not presume to eat them, but contrariwise they are now looked upon as polluted meat. And if they should attempt to eat thereof, it would be a reproach to them and their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p>These Spirits o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> are local.</note> For those which they worship in one County or part of the Land, are not known or owned to have power over the People in other parts. But each Countrey hath seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Spirits</hi> or <hi>Devils,</hi> that are peculiar to those places, and do domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer over them, and are known by several names they call them by: under whose subjection the People do acknowledge themselves to be: and, as I well perceive, do stand in a greater awe of them, than they do of them, whom they call and own to be their <hi>Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed it is sad to consider, how this poor People are subjected to the <hi>Devil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The subjection of this People to the Devil.</note> and they themselves acknowledge it their misery, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Countrey is so full of Devils, and evil Spirits, that unless in this manner they should adore them, they would be destroyed by them. <hi>Christians</hi> they do acknowledge have a Prerogative above themselves, and not to be under the Power of these <hi>infernal Spirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have many times seen Men and Women of this People strangely possest,<note place="margin">Sometimes the Devil possesses them.</note> insomuch that I could judge it nothing else but the effect of the Devil's power upon them: and they themselves do acknowledge as much. In the like condition to which I never saw any that did profess to be a worshipper of the Holy Name of IESUS. They that are thus possest, some of them will run mad into the Woods, screeching and roaring, but do mischief to none; some will be taken so as to be speechless, shaking, and quaking, and dancing, and will tread upon the fire and not be hurt; they will also talk idle, like distracted folk.</p>
                  <p>This may last sometimes two or three Months, sometimes two or three dayes. Now their Friends reckoning it to proceed from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, do go to him and promise him a reward if he will cure them. Sometimes they are cured, and sometimes die. The People do impute this madness to some breach of promise that the Party affected had made to the Devil, or else for eating some fruit or Betel-leaves dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him: For they do dedicate some fruit-trees to the Devil; and this they do, to prevent People from stealing them (which few will dare to do after such a Dedication) and also to excuse themselves in not bestowing their fruit upon any that might ask or desire it. But before this dedicated fruit is lawful for them to use, they must carry some of it to the Temple.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:58692:63"/>This for certain I can affirm, That oftentimes the Devil doth cry with an audible Voice in the Night; 'tis very shrill almost like the bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Dog.<note place="margin">The Devil's Voice often heard.</note> This I have often heard my self; but never heard that he did any body any harm. Only this observation the Inhabitants of the Land have made of this Voice, and I have made it also, that either just before or very suddenly after this Voice, the King always cuts off People. To believe that this is the Voice of the Devil these reasons urge, because there is no Creature known to the Inhabitants, that cry like it, and because it will on a sudden depart from one place, and make a noise in another, quicker than any fowl could fly: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the very Dogs will tremble and shake when they hear it; and 'tis so accounted by all the People.</p>
                  <p>This Voice is heard only in <hi>Cande Vda,</hi> and never in the Low Lands. When the Voice is near to a <hi>Chingulaye</hi>'s house, he will curse the Devil, calling him <hi>Geremoi goulammah, Beef-eating Slave be gone, be damned, cut his Nose off, beat him a pieces.</hi> And such like words of Railery, and this they will speak aloud with noise, and passion, and threatning. This Language I have heard them bestow upon the Voice; and the Voice upon this always ceaseth for a while, and seems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, being heard at a greater distance.</p>

The greatest Solemnity is performed in the City of <hi>Cande</hi>; but at the same time the like Festival or <hi>Perahar</hi> is observed in divers other Cities and Towns of the Land.

                  <p>The Priest bringeth forth a <hi>painted stick,</hi> about which strings of Flowers are hanged, and so it is wrapped in branched Silk, some part covered, and some not; before which the People bow down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; each one presenting him with an Offering according to his free will. These free-will Offerings being received from the People, the Priest takes his painted stick on his Shoulder, having a Cloth tied about

his mouth to keep his breath from defiling this pure piece of Wood, and gets up upon an Elephant all covered with white Cloth, upon which he rides with all the Triumph that King and Kingdom can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, thro all the Streets of the City. But before him go, first some Forty or Fifty Elephants, with brass Bells hanging on each side of them, which tingle as they go.</p>
                  <p>Next, follow men dressed up like <hi>Gyants,</hi> which go dancing along agreeable to a Tradition they have, that anciently there were huge men, that could carry vast Burthens, and pull up Trees by the Roots. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After them go a great multitude of Drummers, and Trumpetters, and Pipers, which make such a great and loud noise, that nothing else besides them can be heard. Then followeth a Company of Men dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing along, and after these Women of such <hi>Casts</hi> or Trades as are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the service of the <hi>Pagoda,</hi> as <hi>Potters</hi> and <hi>Washer-women,</hi> each <hi>cast</hi> goeth in Companies by themselves, three and three in a row, holding one another by the hand; and between each Company go Drummers, Pipers and Dancers.</p>
                  <p>After these comes an Elephant with two Priests on his back: one whereof is the Priest before spoken of, carrying the painted stick on his Shoulder, who represents <hi>Allout neur Dio,</hi> that is, the <hi>God and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Heaven and Earth.</hi> The other sits behind him, holding a round thing, like an <hi>Vmbrello,</hi> over his head, to keep off Sun or Rain. Then within a yard after him on each hand of him follow two other Elephants mounted with two other Priests, with a Priest sitting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind each, holding <hi>Vmbrello</hi>'s as the former, one of them represents <hi>Cotteragom Dio,</hi> and the other <hi>Potting Dio.</hi> These three Gods that ride here in Company are accounted of all other the greatest and chiefest, each one having his residence in a several <hi>Pagoda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behind go their <hi>Cook-women,</hi> with things like whisks in their hands to scare away flies from them; but very fine as they can make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>Next after the Gods and their Attendance, go some Thousands of Ladies and Gentlewomen, such as are of the best sort of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Land, arrayed in the bravest manner that their Ability can afford, and so go hand in hand three in a row: At which time all the Beauties on <hi>Zelone</hi> in their Bravery do go to attend upon their Gods in their Progress about the City. Now are the Streets also all made clean, and on both sides all along the Streets Poles stuck up with Flags and Pennons hanging at the tops of them, and adorned with boughs and branches of Coker Nut-Trees hanging like Fringes, and lighted Lamps all along on both sides of the Streets, both by day and night.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, go the Commanders sent from the King to see these Ceremonies decently performed, with their Soldiers after them. And in this manner they ride all round about the City once by day and once by night. This Festival lasts from the <hi>New</hi> Moon until the <hi>Full</hi> Moon.</p>
                  <p>Formerly the King himself in Person used to ride on Horseback with all his Train before him in this Solemnity, but now he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not in these <hi>Shows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Always before the Gods set out to take their Progress, they are set in the <hi>Pagoda</hi>-Door, a good while, that the People may come to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58692:64"/>
worship and bring their Offerings unto them; during which time there are Dancers, playing and shewing many pretty Tricks of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity before him. To see the which, and also to shew themselves in their Bravery, occasions more People to resort hither, than otherwise their Zeal and Devotion would prompt them to do.</p>
                  <p>Two or thee days before the Full Moon, each of these Gods hath a <hi>Pallenkine</hi> carried after them to add unto their honour. In the which there are several pieces of their <hi>superstitious relicts,</hi> and a Silver Pot. Which just, at the hour of Full Moon they ride out unto a River, and dip full of water, which is carried back with them into the Temple, where it is kept till the year after and then flung away. And so the Ceremony is ended for that year.</p>
                  <p>This Festival of the Gods taking their Progress thro the City, in the year 1664. the King would not permit to be performed; and that same year the <hi>Rebellion</hi> happened, but never since hath he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it.</p>
                  <p>At this time they have a <hi>Superstition,</hi> which lasteth six or seven days, too foolish to write; it consists in Dancing, Singing, and Iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The reason of which is, lest the eyes of the People, or the Power of the <hi>Iacco</hi>'s, or Infernal Spirits, might any ways prove prejudicial or noisom to theaforesaid Gods in their Progress abroad. During the Celebration of this great Festival, there are no Drums allowed to be beaten to any particular Gods at any private Sacrifice.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Feast in <hi>November.</hi>
                     </note>In the Month of <hi>November</hi> the Night when the Moon is at the Full, there is another great solemn Feast, called in their Language <hi>Cawtha Poujah.</hi> Which is celebrated only by lighting of Lamps round about the <hi>Pogada.</hi> At which time they stick up the longest Poles they can get in the Woods, at the Doors of the <hi>Pagods</hi> and of the King's Palace. Upon which they make contrivances to set Lamps in rows one above the other, even unto the very tops of the Poles, which they call <hi>Tor-nes.</hi> To maintain the charge hereof, all the Countrey in general do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, and bring in Oil. In this <hi>Poujah</hi> or Sacrifice the King seems to take delight. The reason of which may be, because he participates far more of the Honour, than the Gods do, in whose name it is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated; his Palace being far more decked and adorned with high Poles and Lights, than the Temples are. This Ceremony lasteth but for one Night.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Festival in honour of the God of the Soul.</note>And these are their <hi>Anniversary Feasts</hi> to the honour of those Gods, whose power extends to help them in this Life; now follows the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Service to the <hi>Buddou,</hi> who it is, they say, that must save their Souls, and the <hi>Festival</hi> in honour of him.</p>
                  <p>To represent the memorial of him to their eye, they do make small Images of Silver, Brass, and Clay, and Stone, which they do honour with Sacrifices and Worship, shewing all the signs of outward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which possibly they can. In most places where there are hollow Rocks and Caves, they do set up Images in memorial of this God. Unto which they that are devoutly bent, at <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Full</hi> Moons do carry Victuals, and worship.</p>
                  <p>His great <hi>Festival</hi> is in the Month of <hi>March</hi> at their New-years Tide. The Places where he is commemorated are two, not Temples, but the one a <hi>Mountain</hi> and the other a <hi>Tree</hi>; either to the one or the other, they at this time go with Wives and Children, for Dignity and Merit one being esteemed equal with the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:58692:64"/>The <hi>Mountain</hi> is at the <hi>South</hi> end of the Countrey, called <hi>Hamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lella,</hi> but by Christian People, <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Peak,</hi> the highest in the whole Island; where, as has been said before, is the Print of the <hi>Buddou</hi>'s foot, which he left on the top of that Mountain in a Rock, from whence he ascended to Heaven. Unto this <hi>footstep</hi> they give worship, light up Lamps, and offer Sacrifices, laying them upon it, as upon an Altar. The benefit of the Sacrifices that are offered here do belong unto the <hi>Moors Pilgrims,</hi> who come over from the other Coast to beg, this having been given them heretofore by a former King. So that at that season there are great numbers of them always waiting there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their accustomed Fees.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tree</hi> is at the <hi>North</hi> end of the King's Dominions at <hi>Annarodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burro.</hi> This <hi>Tree,</hi> they say, came flying over from the other Coast, and there planted it self, as it now stands, under which the <hi>Buddou-God</hi> at his being on earth used, as they say, often to sit. This is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a place of solemn worship, The due performance whereof they reckon not to be a little meritorious: insomuch that, as they report, Ninety Kings have since reigned there successively, where by the ruins that still remain, it appears they spared not for pains and labour to build Temples and high Monuments to the honour of this God, as if they had been born only to hew Rocks, and great Stones, and lay them up in heaps. These Kings are now happy Spirits, having merited it by these their labours.</p>
                  <p>Those whose Ability or Necessity serve them not to go to these Places, may go to some private <hi>Vihars</hi> nearer.</p>
                  <p>For this God above all other,<note place="margin">The high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they have for this God.</note> they seem to have an high respect and Devotion; as will appear by this that follows. Ladies and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of good Quality, will sometimes in a Fit of Devotion to the <hi>Buddou,</hi> go a begging for him. The greatest Ladies of all do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed go themselves, but send their Maids dressed up finely in their stead. These Women taking the Image along with them, carry it upon the palms of their hand covered with a piece of white Cloth; and so go to mens houses, and will say, <hi>We come a begging of your Charity for the Buddou towards his Sacrifice.</hi> And the People are very liberal. They give only of three things to him, either <hi>Oyl</hi> for his Lamps, or <hi>Rice</hi> for his Sacrifice, or <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Cotton Tarn</hi> for his use.</p>
                  <p>Poor men will often go about begging Sustenance for themselves by this means: They will get a Book of Religion, or a <hi>Buddou</hi>'s Image in a Case, wrapping both in a white Cloth, which they carry with great reverence. And then they beg in the name of the Book or the God. And the People bow down to them, and give their Charity, either Corn, or Money, or Cotton yarn. Sometimes they will tell the Beggar, <hi>What have I to give?</hi> And he will reply, <hi>as the saying is, as much as you can take up between your two fingers is Charity.</hi> After he has received a gift from any, he pronounceth a great deal of blessing upon him, <hi>Let the blessing of the Gods and the</hi> Buddou <hi>go along with you; let your Corn ripen, let your Cattle increase, let your Life be long,</hi> &amp;c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Some being devoutly disposed, will make the Image of this God at their own charge. For the making whereof they must bountifully reward the Founder. Before the <hi>Eyes</hi> are made, it is not accounted a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:58692:65"/>
God, but a lump of ordinary Metal, and thrown about the Shop with no more regard than any thing else. But when the <hi>Eyes</hi> are to be made, the Artificer is to have a good gratification, besides the first agreed upon reward. The <hi>Eyes</hi> being formed, it is thenceforward a <hi>God.</hi> And then, being brought with honour from the Workman's Shop, it is dedicated by Solemnities and Sacrifices, and carried with great state into its shrine or little house, which is before built and prepared for it.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes a man will order the <hi>Smith</hi> to make this Idol, and then after it is made will go about with it to well-disposed People to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute toward the Wages the Smith is to have for making it. And men will freely give towards the charge. And this is looked upon in the man that appointed the Image to be made, as a notable piece of Devotion.</p>
                  <p>I have mentioned the <hi>Bogahah Tree</hi> before, which in memory of this God they hold Sacred, and perform Sacrifices, and celebrate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Meetings under. Under this Tree at some convenient distance about ten or twelve foot at the outmost edge of the Platform, they usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally build Booths or Tents; some are made slight only with leaves for the present use, but some are built substantial with hewn Timber and Clay Walls, which stand many years. These Buildings are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into small Tenements for each particular Family. The whole Town joyns, and each man builds his own Appartment: so that the Building goes quite round like a circle, only one gap is left, which is to pass thro to the <hi>Bogahah Tree:</hi> and this gap is built over with a kind of Portal. The use of these Buildings is for the entertainment of the Women. Who take great delight to come and see these Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, clad in their best and richest Apparel. They employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in seeing the Dancers, and the Iuglers do their Tricks: who afterwards by their importunity will get Money of them, or a Ring off their Fingers, or some such matters. Here also they spend their time in eating <hi>Betel,</hi> and in talking with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts, and shewing their fine Cloths. These Solemnities are always in the Night, the Booths all set round with Lamps; nor are they ended in one Night, but last three or four, until the Full Moon, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways puts a Period to them.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Concerning their Religions Doctrines, Opinions, and Practices.</head>
                  <p>THere are few or none <hi>zealous</hi> in their worship,<note place="margin">As to their Religion they are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</note> or have any great matter of esteem for their Gods. And they seldom busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the matters of their Religion, until they come to be sick or very aged. They debar none that will come to see the Ceremonies of their worship; and if a stranger should dislike their way, reprove or mock at them for their Ignorance and Folly, they would acknowledge the same, and laugh at the superstitions of their own Devotion, but withall tell you that they are constrained to do what they do, to keep themselves safe from the malice and mischiefs that the <hi>evil spirits</hi> would otherwise do them, <hi>with which,</hi> they say, <hi>their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try swarm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes in their Sickness they go to the House of their Gods with an Offering,<note place="margin">If their Gods answer not their desires, they Curse them.</note> with which they present him, intreating his favour and aid to restore them to health. Upon the recovery whereof they promise him not to fail but to give unto His <hi>Majesty</hi> (for so they enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle him) far greater Gifts or Rewards, and what they are, they do particularly mention; it may be, <hi>Land, a Slave, Cattle, Money, Cloth,</hi> &amp;c. and so they will discourse, argue and expostulate with him, as if he were there present in Person before them. If after this, he fails on his part, and cannot restore them to their health, then the fore-promised things are to remain where they were: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of which perhaps he gets a Curse, saying, <hi>He doth but cheat and deceive them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a usual saying,<note place="margin">They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile their Gods.</note> and very frequent among them (if their <hi>Gera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hah,</hi> which is their <hi>fortune,</hi> be bad) <hi>What can God do against it:</hi> Nay, I have often heard them say, <hi>Give him no Sacrifice, but shit in his Mouth, what a God is He?</hi> So slight an estimation have they of their <hi>Idol-Gods</hi>; and the King far less esteems them. For he doth not in the least give any countenance either to the <hi>Worshipper,</hi> or to the <hi>manner</hi> of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. And <hi>God</hi>'s name be magnified, that hath not suffered him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb or molest the <hi>Christians</hi> in the least in their Religion, or ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to force them to comply with the Countreys Idolatry. But on the contrary, both King and People do generally like the <hi>Christian</hi> Religion better than their own: and respect and honour the Christians as <hi>Christians</hi>; and do believe there is a greater God than any they adore. And in all probability they would be very easily drawn to the <hi>Christian</hi> or any other Religion: as will appear by this story following.</p>
                  <p>There was lately one among them that pretended himself a <hi>Prophet</hi> sent to them from a <hi>new God,</hi>

For this People stand in fear of all that

For they are not permitted to build their houses above one story high, neither may they cover with tiles, nor whiten their walls with lime, but there is a <hi>Clay</hi> which is as white, and that they use sometimes. They employ no <hi>Carpenters,</hi> or house-builders, unless some few noble-men, but each one buildeth his own dwelling. In building whereof there is not so much as a nail used; but instead of them every thing which might be nailed, is tyed with <hi>rattans</hi> and other strings, which grow in the woods in abundance; whence the builder hath his Timber for cutting. The Country being warm, many of them will not take pains to clay their walls, but make them of boughs and leaves of Trees. The poorest sort have not above one room in their houses, few above two, unless they be great men. Neither doth the King allow them to build better.</p>
                  <p>They are not nice nor curious in their houses. They have no Chimneys in them,<note place="margin">No Chimneys.</note> but make their fires in one corner, so that the roof is all blacked with the smoak.</p>

They have commonly two buildings one opposit to the other, joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on each side with a wall, which makes a square <hi>Court-yard</hi> in the middle. Round about against the walls of their houses are banks of clay to sit on; which they often daub over with soft <hi>Cow-dung,</hi> to keep them smooth and clean. Their Slaves and Servants dwell round about without in other houses with their wives and children.</p>

For none but the King may sit upon a stool with a back. There are also some baskets to put corn in, some mats to spread upon the ground to sleep on: which is the bedding both for themselves and friends when they come to their houses. Also some <hi>Ebeny</hi> pestels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four foot long to beat rice out of the husk, and a wooden <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>

They have also in their houses <hi>Axes, Bills, Houghs, Atches, Chissels,</hi> and other <hi>Tools</hi> for their use. <hi>Tables</hi> they have none, but sit and eat on the ground.</p>
                  <p>And now we are mentioning <hi>eating,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How they eat.</note> let us take a view of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at their <hi>meals.</hi> Their Dyet and ordinary fare is but very mean, as to our account. If they have but Rice and Salt in their house, they reckon they want for nothing. For with a few green Leaves and the juice of a <hi>Lemmon</hi> with Pepper and Salt, they will make a hearty meal. <hi>Beef</hi> here may not be eaten; it is abominable: <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Fish</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what scarce. And that little of it they have, they had rather sell to get mony to keep, then eat it themselves: neither is there any but outlandish men, that will buy any of them. It is they indeed do eat the fat and best of the Land. Nor is it counted any shame or disgrace, to be a niggard and sparing in dyet; but rather a credit even to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of them, that they can fare hard and suffer hunger, which they say, Soldiers ought to be able to endure.</p>
                  <p>The great ones have always five or six sorts of food at one meal,<note place="margin">How the great men eat.</note> and of them not above one or two at most of Flesh or Fish, and of them more pottage than meat, after the <hi>Portugal</hi> fashion. The rest is only what groweth out of the ground. The main substance with which they fill their bellies is Rice, the other things are but to give it a relish.</p>
                  <p>If these people were not discouraged from rearing and nourishing of Cattle and Poultry,<note place="margin">Discouraged from nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cattel.</note> provisions might be far more plentiful.

For from them that have <hi>Hens</hi> his Officers take them for the Kings use giving little or nothing for them; the like they do by <hi>Hogs. Goats</hi> none are suffered to keep, besides the King, except strangers.</p>

And after one is used to that kind of fare, as they dress it, it is very savoury and good. They sit upon a mat on the ground, and eat. But he, whom they do honour and respect, sits on a stool and his victuals on another before him.</p>
                  <p>Their common <hi>drink</hi> is only water:<note place="margin">Their drink and manner of eating.</note> and if they drink <hi>Rack,</hi> it is before they eat, that it may have the more operation upon their bodies.

They eat their Rice out of <hi>China di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,</hi> or Brass Basons, and they that have not them, on leaves. The <hi>Carrees,</hi> or other sorts of Food which they eat with their Rice, is kept in the Pans it is dressed in, and their wives serve them with it, when they call for it. For it is their duties to wait and serve their Husbands while they eat, and when they have done, then to take and eat that which they have left upon their Trenchers. During their eating they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use nor delight to talk to one another.</p>
                  <p>They always wash their hands and mouths both before and after they have eaten;<note place="margin">Their manner of washing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after meals.</note> but for others to pour the water on their hands is looked upon as an affront.

                  <p>HAving been thus entertained with the fine Ladies abroad, it is time now to return home to our <hi>Lodging.</hi> And the night coming on, we will lead you to their Bed-Chambers, and shew you how they sleep. About which they are not very curious. If their house be but one room (as it often is) then the men sleep together at one end and the women at the other.</p>
                  <p>They have <hi>Bedsteads</hi> laced with Canes or Rattans,<note place="margin">Their Bed, and how they sleep a nights.</note> but no <hi>Testars</hi> to them, nor Curtains; that the King allows not of; neither have they nor care they for more than one <hi>Bedstead,</hi> which is only for the Master of the house to sit or sleep on. To this <hi>Bedstead</hi> belongs two mats and a straw Pillow. The Woman with the Children always lyes on the ground on mats by the fire-side. For a Pillow she lays a block or such like thing under her mat, but the Children have no Pillows at all. And for covering and other bedding they use the cloth they wear by day. But always at their feet they will have a fire burning all night. Which makes more work for the Women; who must fetch it all upon her head. For it is accounted a disgrace for the man to meddle or make with those affairs, that properly do belong unto the Woman.</p>
                  <p>The younger sort of Children, such as go naked by day, creep in under a corner of their mothers cloths.<note place="margin">They rise in the night.</note> And if they feel themselves cold in the night, they rise and blow the fire with their mouths, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Bellows in that Countrey, and so sit and warm themselves thereby.</p>

There are not many Ceremonies used in or about the same. Here is no woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a Wife.<note place="margin">No wooing.</note> The Parents commonly make the Match, and in their choice regard more the Quality and Descent than the Beauty. If they are agreed, all is done. The Match being thus made, the Man carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or sends to the Woman her Wedding Cloths; which is a Cloth containing six or seven yards in length, and a Linnen Wast-coat wrought with Blew and Red. If the Man be so poor that he cannot buy a Cloth, it is the Custom to borrow one. In case the Man with his Friends goes and carries it himself, that Night they both sleep together to beget acquaintance one with the other. And then they appoint a day when he is to come and fetch her home; which is the <hi>Marriage-Day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The day being come, he attended with his Friends goes to her house,<note place="margin">The Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom goes to the Brides House.</note> which is always in the Evening, and brings Provisions and Sweet-meats with him according to his Ability, towards the Charges of the <hi>Wedding.</hi> Which is never more than two Meals.

For it is the constant Custom and Fashion in this Land for the Husband to follow his Wife. The reason whereof is a Tradition among them, that a Man once going foremost, it happened that his Wife was stoln away, and he not aware of it.

                  <p>Some few days after,<note place="margin">A Ceremony of Marriage.</note> her Friends usually come to see her bringing a present of Provision with them. And sometimes they use this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the Man is to stand with one end of the Woman's Cloth about his Loins, and she with the other, and then they pour water on both their Heads, wetting all their Bodies: which being done, they are firmly Married to live together, so long as they can agree.</p>
                  <p>The Elder sorts of People usually woe and conclude their Marriages as they are in Bed together. For when they have lost their Maiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, they fear not much what Man comes to sleep with them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he be of as good quality as they, having nothing more to lose. And at the day appointed the Man gives the Woman her Cloths, and so takes her home.</p>
                  <p>But their Marriages are but of little force or validity.<note place="margin">Man and Wife may part at pleasure.</note> For if they disagree and mislike one the other; they part without disgrace.

But in one part or other of this Land they have enough to sustain themselves, I think, without the help of Commodities brought from any other Countrey: exchanging one Commodity for another; and carrying what they have to other parts to supply themselves with what they want.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Husbandry</hi> is the great Employment of the Countrey,<note place="margin">Work not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creditable to the best Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</note> which is spoken of at large before.

Then tying it up in a cloth like a Pudding, they put it into boyling water, and let it boyl a good while. Which done it will be hard like Cheese-curd, then mixing it with Lime, use it. If it be not for present use, they will roul up these Curds into a Ball; which becomes hard, and as they have occasion will scrape some of it off with a Knife, and so temper it with Lime.

                  <p>But their Art in ordering the <hi>Iron-Stone</hi> and making <hi>Iron,</hi> may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be a little insisted on. For the Countrey affords plenty of <hi>Iron,</hi> which they make of Stones, that are in several places of the Land; they lay not very deep in the ground, it may be, about four or five or six <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oot deep.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How they make Iron.</note>First, They take these <hi>Stones,</hi> and lay them in an heap, and burn them with wood, which makes them more soft and fitter for the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. When they have so done they have a kind of Furnace, made with a white sort of Clay, wherein they put a quantity of Charcoal, and then these Stones on them, and on the top more Charcoal. There is a back to the Furnace, like as there is to a Smith's Forge, behind which the man stands that blows, the use of which back is to keep the heat of the fire from him. Behind the Furnace they have two logs of Wood placed fast in the ground, hollow at the top, like two pots. Upon the mouths of these two pieces of hollow wood they tie a piece of a Deers Skin, on each pot a piece, with a small hole as big as a man's finger in each skin. In the middle of each skin a little beside the holes are two strings tied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ast to as many sticks stuck in the ground, like a Spring, bending like a bow. This pulls the skin upwards. The man that blows stand with his feet, one on each pot, covering each hole with the soles of his feet. And as he treads on one pot, and presseth the skin down, he takes his foot off the other, which presently by the help of the Spring riseth; and the doing so alternately conveys a great quantity of wind thro the Pipes into the Furnace. For there are also two Pipes made of hollow reed let in to the sides of the Pots, that are to conduct the wind, like the nose of a Bellows, into the Furnace.</p>
                  <p>For the ease of the Blower, there is a strap, that is fastned to two posts, and comes round behind him, on which he leans his back: and he has a slick laid cross-ways before him, on which he lays both his hands, and so he blows with greater ease. As the Stones are thus burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the dross that is in them melts and runs out at the bottom, where there is a slanting hole made for the purpose so big as the lump of Iron may pass thro: out of this hole, I say, runs out the dross like streams of fire, and the Iron remains behind. Which when it is purified, as they think, enough, so that there comes no more dross away, they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58692:75"/>
drive this lump of Iron thro the same sloping hole. Then they give it a chop with an Ax half thro, and so sling it into the water. They so chop it, that it may be seen that it is good, Iron for the Satisfaction of those that are minded to buy.</p>

And when they were all thus assembled together with their Tools, and necessary Instruments for that purpose, the Nobleman char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them all in the King's Name according to the Countries fashion, which was by pulling off his Cap, and falling down upon the ground three times, that not a man of them should budge till they had paid such a Sum of Money, which was so much a piece, for reviving that Play that the King had forbid.

Two <hi>Cross-bows</hi> stand bent one opposite to the other, charged with Arrows drawn up to the heads: they are placed just so high, as they may fly over a man's back when he lyes flat upon the ground.

Whereupon to clear himself, the Slave desired he might swear.<note place="margin">Swearing in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> So the Merchant and Slave went both to the Temple to swear. The Merchant swore positively that the Slave had robbed his house; and the Slave swore as poynt blank that he had not robbed his house: and neither of them having any witnesses, God who knew all things was desired to shew a Iudgment upon him that was forsworn. They both departed to their houses, waiting to see upon whom the Iudgment would fall. In the mean time the Slave privatly sets the Merchants house on fire, and his house was burnt down to the ground. Then it was clear by this supposed divine Iudgment, the Merchant was forsworn. The Slave presently demands satisfaction for laying The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t fasly to his charge. The Merchant could not tell what to say to it, but would give him none. The Slave was now to take his own satisfaction, as he had opportunity. And his Master bids him seize upon the Merchants Person or any other relating to him, and bring them to his house, and there detain them. Within a short time after, the Slave seeing a Kinsman of the Merchants passing by, offers to seize him. But he, rather than be taken, draws his Knife and Stabs the Slave on the shoulder, and so escapes. In Fine, the Merchant was fain to bribe the Great Men to save himself from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dammage, and sit down contented with the loss of his goods and house. Though the Slave was a person of a very bad reputation, and had done divers Thests; and some of his stolen goods he hath brought to me to sell.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes they do decide their debates by <hi>swearing in hot Oyl.</hi> Which because it is remarkable,<note place="margin">The benefit of swearing in hot Oyl.</note> I will relate at large. They are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thus to swear in matters of great importance only, as when <hi>Law</hi> Suits happen about their Lands, or when their is no witness. When they are to sweare, ach party hath a <hi>Licence</hi> from the Governor for it, written with his hand to it. Then they go and wash their heads and bodies, which is a religious ceremony. And that night they are both confined Prisoners in an house with a guard upon them, and a cloth tyed over each of their right hands and sealed, least they might use any charm to harden their fingers.</p>
                  <p>The next morning they are brought out; they then put on clean cloths, and purifie themselves, reckoning they come into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God. Then they tie to their wrists the <hi>Leaf</hi> wherein the Governors Licence is, and repair under some <hi>Bogahah, God-Tree,</hi> and all the Officers of the County assemble with a vast number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple besides. <hi>Coker-nuts</hi> are brought, and Oyl is there extracted from them in the sight of the people, that all may see their is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. Also they have a Pan of <hi>Cow-dung</hi> and water boyling close by: The <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Cow-dung</hi> being both boyling and throughly hot, they take a young leaf of a <hi>Coker-nut</hi> Tree and dip that into the Oyl, that all may see it is hot. For it singes, and frizzels up, and roars as if you poured water into hot boyling Oyl. And so they do likewise to the <hi>Cow-dung.</hi> When all are satisfied the Oyl is hot, the two men come and stand on each side of this boyling Oyl; and say, <hi>The God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth is witness, that I did not do this that I am accused of</hi>; Or, <hi>The four sorts of Gods be witness, That this Land in controversie is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58692:79"/>
mine.</hi> And then the other swears quite contrary. But first the <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> alwayes swears. The <hi>Accused</hi> also relates his own innocence, or his own Right and Title. The cloths that their hands were bound up in are taken off. And immediatly upon using the former words, he dips his two fingers into the hot Oyl, flinging it out three times. And then goes to the boyling <hi>Cow-dung,</hi> and does the same. And so does the other. Then they tie up their hands again with the cloth, and keep both of them Prisoners till the next day. When their hands are looked upon, and their fingers-ends rubbed with a cloth, to see if the skin come off. And from whose fingers the skin comes, he is forsworn. The Penalty of which is a great forfeiture to the King and great satisfaction to the Adversary.</p>
                  <p>I am able to testifie, that the fingers of some of these that have thus sworn have been whole from any scald after this use o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For the taking of <hi>Fines</hi> from men, on whom they are laid, this is their Custom.<note place="margin">How they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Fines.</note> The Officers, wheresoever they meet the man, stop him in the place.

And if he doth not pay, they load him with more Stones, until his compliance prevent further pains. Another way they have to exact the payment of the Fines laid upon them. They take some sprigs of Thorns, and draw them between the mans naked Legs till he pays. But if he r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>They have an odd usage among them to recover their debts. Which is this. They will sometimes go to the house of their debtor with the leaves of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The debtor is much afraid of this, and rather than the other should Poyson himself, will sometimes sell a Child to pay the debt: Not that the one is tender of the life of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but out of care of himself. For if the party dyes of the Poyson, the other for whose sake the man Poysoned himself must pay a ransome for his life. By this means also they will sometimes threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to revenge themselves of those with whom they have any contest, and do it too. And upon the same intent they will also jump down some steep place or hang or make away with themselves; that so they might bring their Adversary to great dammage.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. X. Concerning their Learning, Astronomy, and Art Magick.</head>
                  <p>THeir <hi>Learning</hi> is but small.<note place="margin">Of their Learning.</note> All they ordinarily learn is to read and to write. But it is no shame to a man if he can do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nor have they any <hi>Schools</hi> wherein they might be taught and instructed in these or any other Arts.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Books</hi> are only of their <hi>Religion</hi> and of <hi>Physick.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Their Books, and Arts.</note> Their chief Arts are <hi>Astronomy</hi> and <hi>Magick.</hi> They have a Language something differing from the vulgar tongue (like <hi>Latin</hi> to us) which their Books are writ in. They learn to write upon Sand,<note place="margin">How they learn to write.</note> spreading it upon the ground, and making it smooth with the hand, and so write the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with their fingers to bring their hand in use.</p>
                  <p>They write not on Paper, for of that they have little or none; but on a Talli-pot leaf with an Iron Bodkin, which makes an impression. This leaf thus written on, is not folded, but rolled up like Ribbond, and somewhat resembles Parchment.</p>
                  <p>If they are to write a Book,<note place="margin">How they make and write a Book.</note> they do it after this manner. They take the <hi>Tallipot</hi> leaf, and cut it into divers pieces of an equal shape and size, some a foot, some eight inches, some a foot and an half long, and about three fingers broad. Then having thus prepared the leaves, they write in them long ways from the left hand to the right, as we do. When the Book is finished they take two pieces of board, which are
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58692:83"/>
to serve for the cover of the Book. To these boards are fastened two strings, which do pass thro every leaf of the Book, and these tye it up fast together. As the Reader hath read each leaf, he lifts it up, and lays it by still hanging upon the strings, and so goes to the next leaf, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing resembling Bills filed upon Wyre.</p>
                  <p>

                     </note>The <hi>Gonnies,</hi> who are men of leisure, write many Books of <hi>Bonna,</hi> that is of the Ceremonies of their Religion: and will sometimes carry them to great Men, as a present, and do expect a reward.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The King's Warrants how wrapped up.</note>The King when he sends any <hi>Warrants</hi> or Orders to his Officers, hath his Writings wrapped up in a way proper to himself, and none else do or may fold up their leaves in that manner but He.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">They write upon two sorts of leaves.</note>They write upon the <hi>Tallipat</hi> leaves <hi>Records</hi> or matters of great moment, or that are to be kept and preserved: but for any ordinary business as Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they commonly use another leaf, called <hi>Taul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole.</hi> The leaves of which will bear a better impression than the <hi>Talli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat,</hi> but they are more stubborn, and harder than the other, and will not fold.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Their Skill in Astronomy.</note>But to speak a little of their <hi>Astronomy.</hi> They who have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in it, and practise it, are the <hi>Priests</hi> of the highest Order, of which the present King's Father was. But the common sort of <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers</hi> are the <hi>Weavers.</hi> These men can certainly foretel <hi>Eclipses</hi> of the Sun and Moon. They make <hi>Leet,</hi> that is <hi>Almanacks</hi> that last for a Month.<note place="margin">Their Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks.</note> They are written upon a <hi>Tallipat</hi> leaf, a little above a foot long, and two fingers broad. In them are told the Age of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and the good Seasons and times to begin to Plough or to Sow, or to go a Iourney, or to take any work in hand. On this precise time they will be sure to sprinkle their first Seed, tho they sow all their Field it may be a Month after. And so they will begin to set forth at the very moment, tho possibly they will not go till some days after.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Astronomers</hi> tell them also when the old year ends to the very minute. At which time they cease from all work, except the Kings, which must not be omitted. They acquaint them also with the good hour of the New year, they are to begin to work. At which time every Man and Woman begins to do somewhat in their employment they intend to follow the ensuing year. They have also another season directed them by their <hi>Astronomers:</hi> that is, when to begin to <hi>wash their heads,</hi> which is assigned to every one according to the time of their <hi>Nativities,</hi> which Ceremony they observe very religiously.</p>

                  <p>VVhen a Person is Sick, he carries to these men his <hi>Nativity,</hi> which they call <hi>Hanna hom pot,</hi> upon the perusal of which they tell his destiny. These also direct <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is a <hi>Copper Dish</hi> holding about a Pint, with a very small hole in the bottom.

And then they take it out, and set it empty on the water again, and that makes one <hi>Pay.</hi> Few or none use this but the King, who keeps a man on purpose to watch it continually. The People will use it upon some occasions, as if they are to sow their Corn at any particular hour, as being the good lucky Season, then they make use of the <hi>Copper Pan,</hi> to know the time exactly.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Their Magick.</note> Whereof take these two remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of many that might be given.</p>
                  <p>The Countrey of <hi>Neurecalava</hi> formerly brought forth great plenty of Corn, occasioned by reason of its large waterings.<note place="margin">The Plenty of a Countrey destroyed by Magick.</note> A Neighbour Kingdom, the Kingdom of <hi>Cournegal</hi> which lyes in <hi>Hotcourley,</hi> in those times was brought to a great dearth. At which the King sends to the People of <hi>Neurecalava,</hi> that they would bring a supply of Corn to his Countrey, which they did in great store upon Beasts in Sacks, and arrived at the King's City: and there for the more expeditious measuring out every Housholder his proportion of Corn, they made a hole in the Sacks, and let it run out, still driving on the Beasts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: and all that was shed before every man's House, was to be his share. This exceedingly gratified the King.</p>
                  <p>Afterward the King to requite them, asked what they most needed in their Countrey? They answered, They had plenty of all things, only they wanted <hi>Cahah mirris,</hi> that is <hi>Turmeric</hi> and <hi>Pepper.</hi> The King to gratifie them sent them such a quantity of each as his Country could afford. As soon as this was brought to the People of <hi>Neure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calava,</hi> they went to measure it out to every man his Portion, but finding it of so small a quantity, they resolved to grind it, as they do when they use it with their Victuals, and put it into the River to give a seasoning to the water, and every Man was to take up his Dish
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58692:84"/>
of water thus seasoned. From whence <hi>Neurecalava</hi> had its deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Neur,</hi> signifying a <hi>City,</hi> and <hi>Cahah</hi> that signifies <hi>Turmeric,</hi> and <hi>Lava,</hi> as if it were <hi>Lalla, put into the River.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King hearing of this Action of theirs was offended, in that they so contemned his gift; but concealed his displeasure. Sometime after he took a Iourney to them, and being there, desired to know how their Countrey became so very fruitful. They told him, it was the water of the River pent up for their use in a very vast Pond. Out of which they made Trenches to convey the water down into their Corn Grounds. This Pond they had made with great Art and Labour with great Stones and Earth thrown up of a vast length and thickness, in the fashion of an half Moon. The King afterwards took his leave of them and went home; and by the help of his <hi>Magicians</hi> brake down this vast Dam that kept in the water, and so destroyed the Pond. And by this means this fruitful Countrey wanting her water is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as ordinary Land as the rest, having only what falls out of the Sky.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Their Charm to find out a Thief.</note>When a Robbery is committed to find the Thief, they Charm a <hi>Coker-nut,</hi> which is done by certain words, and any one can do it, that can but utter the Charm words. Then they thrust a stick into it, and set it either at the Door or hole the Thief went out at. Then one holds the stick with the Nut at the end of it, and the Nut pursues and follows in the Tract that the Thief went. All the way it is going they still continue Charming, and flinging the Blossoms of the <hi>Betel-nut-Tree</hi> upon it. And at last it will lead to the house or place where the Thief is, and run upon his Feet. This Nut will sometimes go winding hither and thither, and sometimes will stand still. Then they follow their Charms, strewing on Blossoms, and that sets it forward again. This is not enough to find the Thief guilty; but if they intend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the Man upon this Discovery, the Charmer must swear against him point blank: which he sometimes will do upon the Confidence of the Truth of his Charm: And the supposed Thief must either Swear or be Condemned.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The way to dissolve this Charm.</note>Oftentimes Men of courage and metal, will get Clubs, and beat away the Charmer, and all his Company, and by this means put all to an end. If the Thief has the wit to lay his tail by the way, the <hi>Coker-nut</hi> when it comes thither will stop and run round about it, but go no further. I doubting the truth hereof, once took the stick, and held it my self, when they were upon this Business, but it moved not forward while I held it in my hand, tho they strewed their Flowers, and used their mutterings to provoke it. But afterwards when another took it, it went forward. I doubted whether they did not guide it with their hand, but they assured me it guided their hand.</p>

With which they purge and vomit themselves, and will do notable Cures upon green wounds, and also upon sore eyes.</p>
                  <p>To give a few hints of their method of Physick and what Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents they make use of.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>purging</hi> they make use of a Tree called <hi>Dallugauhah.</hi>

After tis taken off the fire, they put this salt into it, and drink it.</p>

There is one plant among the rest so strong a venom, that no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will eat or touch it; and this is the leaf, that the People some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times carry with them when they go to demand their debts, and threaten their debtors, they will poyson themselves before them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they will pay them. It is called <hi>Neiingala,</hi> a sprig that springs out of the ground almost like an <hi>Hony-suckle,</hi> but not so big: and bears a curious Flower much like an <hi>Hony-suckle.</hi>

                  <p>These People are very loath to dye, and as much afraid of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in their sickness,<note place="margin">They both bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and burn their dead.</note> whom at such times they chiefly invoke.

But the poorer sort who regard not such matters bury them making a hole in the Woods, and carrying the body wrapped up in a mat upon a Pole on their shoulders with two or three attending it, and so laying it in without any ceremony, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p>Some days after his decease, if his friends wish well to his Soul,<note place="margin">They send for a Priest to pray for his Soul.</note> they send for a Priest to the house, who spends a whole night in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and sing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ng for the saving of that Soul. This Priest besides very good entertainment, in the morning must have great gifts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And to encourage them therein, he tells them that the like bounty and liberality as they shew to him, shall the Soul of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted friend receive in the other world. And so according to their ability, they freely give unto him, such things as they are possessors of. And he out of his wonderful good nature refuseth not any thing, be it never so mean. And thus with Drums and Pipes sounding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, they conduct him home to his house.</p>
                  <p>Their manner of mourning for the dead is,<note place="margin">How they mourn for the dead.</note> that all the Women that are present do loose their hair, and let it hang down, and with their two hands together behind their heads do make an hideous noise, crying and roaring as loud as they can, much praysing and extolling the Virtues of the deceased, tho there were none in him: and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own woful condition to live without him. Thus for three or four mornings they do rise early, and lament in this manner, also on evenings. Mean while the men stand still and sigh.</p>
                  <p>These women are of a very strong couragious spirit,<note place="margin">The nature of the Women.</note> taking nothing very much to heart, mourning more for fashion than affection, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver overwhelmed neither with grief or love.

                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:58692:86"/>It may not be unacceptable to relate how they burn their Dead.<note place="margin">How they Bury.</note> As for Persons of inferior Quality, they are interred in some convenient places in the Woods, there being no set places for Burial, carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by two or three of their Friends, and Buried without any more ado. They lay them on their Backs, with their heads to the <hi>West</hi> and their feet to the <hi>East,</hi> as we do. Then those People go and wash; for they are unclean by handling the Dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How they Burn.</note>But Persons of greater quality are burned, and that with Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. When they are dead they lay them out, and put a Cloth over their Privy Parts, and then wash the Body, by taking half a dozen Pitchers of water, and pouring upon it. Then they cover him with a Linnen cloth, and so carry him forth to burning. This is when they burn the Body speedily. But otherwise, they cut down a Tree that may be proper for their purpose, and hollow it, like a Hog-trough, and put the Body being Embowelled and Embalmed into it, filled up all about with Pepper. And so let it lay in the house, until it be the King's Command to carry it out to the burning. For that they dare not do without the King's order, if the Person deceased be a Courtier. Sometimes the King gives no order in a great while, it may be not at all. Therefore in such cases, that the Body may not take up house-room, or annoy them, they dig an hole in the floar of their house, and put hollowed tree and all in and cover it. If afterwards the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to burn the Body, they take it up again in obedience to the King, otherwise there it lyes.</p>
                  <p>Their order for <hi>burning</hi> is thus. If the Body be not thus put into a Trough or hollowed Tree, it is laid upon one of his Bedsteds, which is a great honour among them. This Bedsted with the Body on it, or hollowed Tree with the Body in it, is fastned with Poles, and carried upon Mens Shoulders unto the place of Burning: which is some emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent place in the Fields or High-ways, or where else they please. There they lay it upon a Pile of Wood some two or three foot high. Then they pile up more Wood upon the Corps, lying thus on the Bedsted, or in the Trough. Over all they have a kind of <hi>Canopy</hi> built, if he be a Person of very high Quality covered at top, hung about with painted Cloth, and bunches of Coker-nuts, and green Boughs; and so fire is put to it. After all is burnt to ashes, they sweep together the ashes into the manner of a Sugar loaf: and hedg the place round from wild Beasts breaking in, and they will sow Herbs there. Thus I saw the King's Uncle, the chief <hi>Tirinanx,</hi> who was as it were the <hi>Primate</hi> of all the Nation, burned, upon an high place, that the blaze might be seen a great way. If they be No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, but not of so high quality, there is only a Bower erected over them, adorned with Plantane Trees, and green boughs, and bunches as before.</p>

Whereupon <hi>Cotiar,</hi> in the Island of <hi>Ceilon,</hi> being a very commodious Bay, fit for our present Distress, <hi>Thomas Chambers</hi> 
                     <abbr>Esq</abbr> (since Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>) the Agent at Fort <hi>S.

Where being arrived according to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of those <hi>Indian</hi> Merchants of <hi>Porta Nova</hi> we carried with us, to whom those Goods belonged, they were put ashore, and we minded our Business to set another Main-mast, and repair our other Dammages we had sustained by the late Storm.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:58692:88"/>By this time the King of the Countrey had notice of our being there, and as I suppose grew suspicious of us,<note place="margin">A pretended Message to the Captain from the King.</note> not having all that while by any Message made him acquainted with our intent and purpose in coming. Thereupon he dispatched down a <hi>Dissauva</hi> or General with his Army to us. Who immediately sent a Messenger on Board to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Captain with his coming, and desired him to come ashore to him, pretending a Letter to him from the King. We saluted the Message with firing of Guns, and my Father the Captain ordered me with Mr. <hi>Iohn Loveland,</hi> Merchant of the Ship, to go on shore and wait upon him. When we were come before him, he demanded <hi>who we were, and how long we should stay?</hi> We told him, <hi>We were</hi> English, <hi>and not to stay above twenty or thirty days,</hi> and desired Permission to Trade in his Majestie's Port. His answer was, the King was glad to hear that the <hi>English</hi> were come to his Countrey, and had commanded him to assist us as we should desire, and had sent a Letter to be delivered to none, but to the Captain himself.</p>
                  <p>We were then some twelve Miles from the Sea-side. Our reply was, <hi>That the Captain could not leave his Ship to come so far, but if he pleased to come down to the Sea-side himself, the Captain would immediately wait upon him to receive the Letter.</hi> Upon which the <hi>Dissauva</hi> desired us to stay that day, and on the morrow he would go down with us.</p>
                  <p>Which being a small request, and we unwilling to displease him, consented to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Suspition.</note>The same day at Evening, the <hi>Dissauva</hi> sent two of his chief Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the House where we lay to tell us, That he was sending a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Captain, and if we pleased we might send a Letter to him; that he would send the Present in the Night, and himself with us fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the next Morning. At which we began to suspect, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly concluded to write and advise the Captain not to adventure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, nor any other on shore till he saw us. We having writ a Letter to this purpose they took it and went away, but never deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Captain seized, and seven more.</note>The next Morning the Present, which was <hi>Cattle, Fruit,</hi> &amp;c. was brought to the Sea side, and delivered to the Captain; the Messengers telling him withal, that we were upon the way coming down, with the <hi>Dissauva</hi>; who desired his Company on shore against his coming, having a Letter from the King to deliver into his own hand. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Captain mistrusting nothing, came up with his Boat into a small River, and being come ashore, sat down under a <hi>Tamarind Tree,</hi> waiting for the <hi>Dissauva</hi> and us. In which time the Native Soldiers privately surrounded him and Men, having no Arms with them; and so he was seized on and seven men with him, yet without any violen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e or plundering them of any thing: and then they brought them up unto us, carrying the Captain in a Hammock upon their Shoulders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Long-boat Men seized.</note>The next day after, the Long-boats Crew, not knowing what had happened, came ashore to cut a Tree to make Cheeks for the Main-mast, and were made Prisoners after the same manner, tho' with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. For they being rough and making resistance, were bound with Wyths, and so were led away till they came where the People got Ropes. Which when our Men saw brought to them, they were not a little affrighted. For being already bound, they concluded there
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58692:88"/>
could be no other use for those Ropes but to hang them. But the true use of them was to bind them faster, fearing lest the Wyths might break, and so they were brought up farther into the Countrey; but afterwards being become more tame, they were loosed. They would not adventure to bring them to us, but quartered them in another House, tho in the same Town. Where without leave we could not see one another. The House wherein they kept the Captain and us, was all hanged with white <hi>Callico,</hi> which is the greatest Honour they can shew to any. But the House wherein the other men were, that were brought up after us, was not. They gave us also as good Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the Countrey afforded.</p>
                  <p>Having thus taken both our Boats and Eighteen men of us,<note place="margin">The General's Craft to get the Ship, as well as the Men.</note> their next care was, fearing lest the Ship should be gone, to secure her: Therefore to bring this about, the <hi>Dissauva</hi> told the Captain that the reason of this their detainment was, that the King intended to send <hi>Letters</hi> and a <hi>Present</hi> to the <hi>English</hi> Nation by him, and therefore that the Ship must not go away, till the King was ready to send his Messenger and Message, and thereupon desired the Captain to send on Board to order her stay; and it being not safe for her to ride in the Bay, lest the <hi>Dutch</hi> might come and fire her, that he should take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for her bringing up into the River. Which advice of his, the Captain approved not of. But concealing his dislike of it, replied, that unless he could send two of his own men on Board with his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Order, those in the Ship would not obey him, but speedily would be gone with the Ship. Which he, rather than he would run the hazzard of the Ships departing, granted; imagining that the Captain would order the Ship to be brought up into the River, as he had advised, tho the Captain intended to make another use of this Message.</p>
                  <p>Upon which the Captain sent two of his men,<note place="margin">The Captain's Order to them on board the ship.</note> some <hi>Indians</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying them in a <hi>Canoo</hi> to the Ship, the Captain ordering them when they were aboard not to abuse the <hi>Indians,</hi> but to entertain them very kindly, and afterwards that setting them ashore, they should keep the <hi>Canoo</hi> to themselves, instead of our two Boats, which they had gotten from us, and to secure the Ship, and wait till further order.</p>
                  <p>These two men stayed on Board, and came not back again. This together with the Ships not coming up displeased the <hi>Dissauva,</hi> and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>CHAP. II. How we were carried up into the Countrey, and disposed of there, and of the sickness, sorrow and death of the Captain.</head>
                  <p>THe <hi>Dissauva</hi> with his men being gone, the people of the Town were appointed to guard and secure us until further order.<note place="margin">They intend to attempt an Escape, but are prevented.</note> But they carryed us some six miles higher into the Countrey, and would not yet adventure to bring the <hi>Long boats-crew</hi> unto us, but kept them by themselves in another Town, fearing lest we might make an escape, as certainly we would have attempted it, had they not removed us. There was a small <hi>Moors</hi> Vessel, which lay in the River, which they had seized on about this time, as we supposed they would have done by our Ship if they could have catched her there. This Vessel had some forty men belonging to her, who were not made Prisoners as we were, but yet lay in the same Town: with those we had concluded, that they should furnish us with Arms, and in the night altogether to march down, and get on board of their Vessel, and so make our escape. But being prevented in this design by our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, we were fain to lay at their mercy.</p>
                  <p>In our new quarters our entertainment proved as good as formerly. And indeed there was this to mitigate our misery, that the People were courteous to us and seemed to pity us.<note place="margin">Their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the People.</note> For there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the People inhabiting the high-lands, or the mountains of <hi>Cande,</hi> and those of the low-lands where we now are placed, who are of a kinder nature by far than the other. For these Countreys be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the mountains formerly were in subjection unto the <hi>Portugueze.</hi> Whereby they have been exercised and acquainted with the customs and manners of <hi>Christian</hi> People. Which pleasing them far better than their own have begot and bred in them a kind of love and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards Strangers, being apt to shew Pity and Compassion on them in their distress. And you shall hear them oftentimes upbraiding the High-landers for their insolent and rude behavior.</p>
                  <p>It was a very sad Condition whilst we were all together,<note place="margin">They are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed into divers Town,</note> yet hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to each others company lessened our sufferings, and was some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that we might condole one another. But now it came to pass that we must be separated and placed asunder, one in a Village, where we could have none to confer withall or look upon, but the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible black faces of our heathen enemies, and not understand one word of their Language neither, this was a great addition to our grief. Yet God was so merciful to us, as not to suffer them to part my Father and I.</p>
                  <p>For it was some sixteen days after our last remove,<note place="margin">An Order comes from the King to bring them up into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</note> the King was pleased to send a Captain with Soldiers to bring us up into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Who brought us and the other men taken in the Long boat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Which was an heavy meeting; Being then, as we well saw, to be carried Captives into the mountains. That night we supped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and the next morning changed our condition into real Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. Howbeit they gave us many comfortable promises, which we believed not; as, <hi>that the Kings intent was not to keep us any longer,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58692:90"/>
than till another Ship came to carry us away.</hi> Altho we had but very little to carry, God knows, yet they appointed men to carry the cloths that belonged to the Captain and Officers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How they were Treated on the way in the Woods.</note>We still expected they would plunder us of our cloths, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to be plundered of: but the <hi>Chingulay</hi> Captain told us, that the King had given order that none should take the value of a thread from us: Which indeed they did not. As they brought us up they were very tender of us, as not to tyre us with Travelling, bidding us go no faster than we would our selves. This kindness did somewhat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort us. The way was plain and easie to Travail through great Woods, so that we walked as in an Arbour, but desolate of Inhabitants. So that for four or five nights we lay on the Ground, with Boughs of Trees only over our heads. And of Victuals twice a Day they gave us as much as we could eat, that is, of Rice, Salt-fish, dryed Flesh: And sometimes they would shoot Deer and find Hony in the Trees, good part of which they always brought unto us. And drink we could not want, there being Rivers and Puddles full of Water as we Travelled along.</p>
                  <p>But when we came out of the Woods among Inhabitants and were led into their Towns,<note place="margin">And in the Towns among the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</note> they brought us Victuals ready dressed after their fashion, <hi>viz.</hi> Rice boiled in Water, and three other sorts of Food, whereof one Flesh, and the other two Herbs or such like things that grow in their Countrey, and all kinds of ripe Fruit, which we liked very well and fed heartily upon. Our entertainment all along was at the Charge of the Countrey: So we fed like Soldiers upon free Quarter. Yet I think we gave them good content for all the Charge we put them to. Which was to have the satisfaction of seeing us eat, sitting on Mats upon the Ground in their yards to the Publick view of all Beholders. Who greatly admired us, having never seen, nor scarce heard of, <hi>English-men</hi> before. It was also great entertainment to them to observe our manner of eating with Spoons, which some of us had, and that we could not take the Rice up in our hands, and put it to our mouths without spilling, as they do, nor gaped and powred the Water into our Mouths out of Pots according to their Countreys custom. Thus at every Town where we came they used both young and old in great Companies to stare upon us.</p>
                  <p>Being thus brought up all together somewhat near to the City of <hi>Cande.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">They are brought near <hi>Cande,</hi> and there sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> Now came an Order from the King to separate us, and to place us one in a Town. Which then seemed to us to be very hard, but it was for the convenience of getting Food, being quartered upon the Countrey at their Charge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Captain and his Son and two more quartered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note>The Captain Mr. <hi>Iohn Loveland,</hi> my self and <hi>Iohn Gregory</hi> were parted from the rest, and brought nearer to the City, to be ready when the King should send for us. All the Rest were placed one in a Town according to the aforesaid Order. Special Command also was given from the King, that we all should be well entertained, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Countrey fare we had no cause to complain.<note place="margin">Parted.</note> We four were thus kept together some two Months, faring well all the while.<note place="margin">How they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> My Father and I were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a Town called <hi>Bonder Coos-wat</hi> the situation was very pleasing and commodious, lying about Thirty Miles to the Northward of the City of <hi>Cande,</hi> in the Countrey called <hi>Hotcurly</hi> and distant from the rest of our People a full days journey. We were removed hither from another Town nearer to the City where the Nobles at Court suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that the King would call for vs, had placed us to have us ready. Being thus brought to <hi>Bonder Cooswat,</hi> the People put it to our choice which House we would have to reside in. The Countrey being hot and their Houses dark and dirty, my Father chose an open House, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only a Roof but no Walls. Wherein they placed a Cot, or Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead only with a Mat upon it for him, which in their Account is an extraordinary Lodging; and for me a Mat upon the Ground.</p>
                  <p>Moneys at that time were very low with us.<note place="margin">Moneys scarce with them.</note> For although we wanted not for opportunity to send for what we would have brought unto unto us from the Ship, yet fearing we should be plundered of it, sent not for any thing only a Pillow for my Father. For we held it a point without dispute, that they that made Prisoners of our Bodies would not spare to take our Goods; my Father also alledging, that he had rather his Children at home should enjoy them.</p>
                  <p>But to make amends for that, we had our Provisions brought us without money,<note place="margin">But they had good Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without it.</note> and that twice a Day, so much as we could eat, and as good as their Countrey yielded; to wit, a Pot of good Rice, and three Dishes of such things as with them is accounted good Cheer; one always either Flesh, Fish or Eggs; but not over much of this Dish, the other Dishes, Herbs, Pumkins or such like, one of which is always made sower.</p>
                  <p>The first year that we were brought into this Town,<note place="margin">The Town where they were, Sickly.</note> this part of the Land was extraordinary Sickly by Agues and Feavours, whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People dyed; insomuch that many times we were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main an hungry, there being none well enough either to boil or bring Victuals unto us.</p>
                  <p>We had with us a <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> seven Treatises, called the <hi>Practice of Christianity.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How they passed their time.</note> With which companions we did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently discourse; and in the cool of the Evening walk abroad in the Fields for a refreshing, tyred with being all day in our House or Prison.</p>
                  <p>This Course lasted until God was pleased to visit us both with the Countrey Sickness,<note place="margin">They both fall Sick.</note> 
                     <hi>Ague and Feavour.</hi> The sight of my Fathers misery was farmore grievous unto me than the sence of my own, that I must be a Spectator of his Affliction, and not any ways able to help him. And the sight of me so far augmented his grief, that he would often say, <hi>What have I done when I charged you to come ashore to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, your dutifulness to me hath brought you to be a Captive. I am old and cannot long hold out, but you may live to see many days of Sorrow, if the mercy of God do not prevent it. But my prayers to God for you shall not be wanting, that for this cause he would visit you with his Mercy, and bestow on you a Blessing.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:58692:91"/>My Father's Ague lasted not long, but deep grief daily more and more increased upon him, which so over-whelmed even his very heart, that with many a bitter sigh he used to utter these words,<note place="margin">Deep Grief seizes the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</note> 
                     <hi>These many years even from my youth have I used the Seas, in which time the Lord God hath deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Their Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness continues.</note>Upwards of three Months my Father lay in this manner upon his Bed, having only under him a Mat and the Carpet he sat upon in the Boat when he came ashore, and a small Quilt I had to cover him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And I had only a Mat upon the Ground and a Pillow to lay on, and nothing to cover me but the Cloths on my back: but when I was cold, or that my Ague came upon me, I used to make a Fire, Wood costing nothing, but the fetching.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Their Boy's disobedience adds to their trouble.</note>We had a <hi>black Boy</hi> my Father brought from <hi>Porto Nova</hi> to attend upon him, who seeing his Master to be a Prisoner in the hands of the People of his own Complexion, would not now obey his Command, further than what agreed unto his own humour, neither was it then as we thought in our Power to compel or make him; but it was our ignorance. As for me, my Ague now came to a settled course; that is, once in three days, and so continued for Sixteen Months time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">His excessive sorrow.</note>There appearing now to us no probability, whereupon to build any hopes of Liberty, the sence of it struck my Father into such an Agony and strong Passion of Grief, that once I well remember in Nine days time nothing came into his mouth, but cold water; neither did he in three Months together ever rise up out of his Bed, but when the course of Nature required it: always groaning and sighing in a most piteous manner: which for me to hear and see come from my dear Father, my self also in the same Condition, did almost break my heart. But then I felt that Doctrine most true, which I had read out of Mr. <hi>Roger</hi>'s Book, <hi>That God is most sweet, when the world is most bitter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this manner my Father lay until the Ninth of <hi>February</hi> 16 60/61. By which time he was consumed to an <hi>Anatomy,</hi> having nothing left but Skin to cover his Bones; yet he often would say, <hi>That the very sound of Liberty would so revive him, that it would put strength into his Limbs.</hi> But it was not the will of him, to whom we say, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> to have it so.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">His Discourse and charge to his Son before his Death.</note>The evening before his Death, he called me to come near his Bed side, and to sit down by him, at which time also I had a strong Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor upon me. This done, he told me, <hi>That he sensibly felt his life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from him, and was assured that this Night God would deliver him out of this Captivity, and that he never thought in all his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time that Death could be so easie and welcom to any Man, as God had
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58692:91"/>
made it to be to him, and the joyes he now felt in himself he wanted utterance to express to me.</hi> He told me, <hi>These were the last words, that ever he should speak to me, and bid me well regard and be sure to remember them, and tell them to my Brother and Sister, if it pleased God, as he hoped it would, to bring us together in</hi> England; <hi>where I should find all things settled to my contentation,</hi> relating to me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner he had settled his Estate by Letters which he sent from <hi>Cotiar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the first place and above all, He charged me to serve God, and with a circumspect care to walk in his ways, and then,</hi> he said, <hi>God would bless me and prosper me. And next,</hi> he bad me <hi>have a care of my Brother and Sister.</hi> And lastly, <hi>He gave me a special charge to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of strong Drink, and lewd Company, which as by Experience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had found, would change me into another man, so that I should not be my self. It deeply grieved him,</hi> he said, <hi>to see me in Captivity in the prime of my years, and so much the more because I had chosen ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to suffer Captivity with him than to disobey his Command. Which now he was heartily sorry for, that he had so commanded me, but bad me not repent of obeying the command of my Father; seeing for this very thing,</hi> he said, <hi>God would bless me,</hi> and bid me <hi>be assured of it, which he doubted not of,</hi> viz. <hi>That God Almighty would deliver me</hi>: which at that time I could not tell how to conceive, seeing but little sign of any such Matter. But blessed be the Name of my most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, who hath so bountifully sustained me ever since in the Land of my Captivity, and preserved me alive to see my Deceased Father's word fulfilled! And truly I was so far from repenting, that I had obeyed the Command of my Father, and performed the Oath and Promise I made unto him upon it, that it rather rejoyced me to see that God had given me so much Grace.</p>
                  <p>But tho it was a trouble to him, that by his means I was thus made a Captive; yet <hi>it was a great Comfort to him,</hi> he said, <hi>to have his own Son sit by him on his Death-bed, and by his hands to be Buried, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwise he could expect no other but to be eaten by Dogs or wild Beasts.</hi> Then he gave me order concerning his Burial, <hi>That having no winding she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>According to his own appointment with my own hands I wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped him up ready for the Grave;<note place="margin">And Burial.</note> my self being very sick and weak, and as I thought ready to follow after him. Having none but the black Boy with me, I bad him ask the People of the Town for help to carry my Father to the Grave, because I could not understand their Language. Who immediately brought forth a great Rope they used to tye their Cattle withal, therewith to drag him by the Neck into the Woods, saying, <hi>They could afford me no other help, unless I would pay for it.</hi> This Insolency of the Heathen grieved me much to see, neither could I with the Boy alone do what was necessary for his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, though we had been able to carry the Corps, having not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to dig a Grave, and the ground very dry and hard. Yet it was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58692:92"/>
some comfort to me that I had so much Ability as to hire one to help; which at first I would not have spared to have done, had I known their meaning.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The Place where he lyes.</note>By this means I thank God, in so decent a manner as our present condition would permit, I laid my Father's Body in the Grave. Most of which I digged with my own hands; the place being in a Wood, on the North-side of a Corn Field, where heretofore we had used of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to walk, going up to <hi>Handapoul:</hi> that Division, as I have said, being called <hi>Bonder Cooswat,</hi> because formerly it had belonged to the Revenues or Iointure of the Queen, <hi>Bonder</hi> implying something rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the King. It lyes towards the Northwest of the middle of the Island in the County of <hi>Hotcurly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus was I left Desolate, Sick, and in Captivity, having no earthly Comforter, none but only He who looks down from Heaven to hear the groaning of the Prisoners, and to shew himself a Father of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless, and a present help to them that have no helper.</p>

The reason I ask,</hi> said the old Man, <hi>is because I have one I got when the</hi> Portugueze <hi>lost</hi> Columbo, <hi>and if your Master please to buy it, I will sell it him.</hi> Which when I heard of, I bad my Boy go to his House with him, which was not far off, and bring it to me to see it, making no great account of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, supposing it might be some <hi>Portugueze</hi> Book.</p>
                  <p>The Boy having formerly served the <hi>English,</hi> knew the Book, and as soon as he had got it in his hand came running with it, calling out to me, <hi>It is a Bible.</hi> It startled me to hear him mention the name of a <hi>Bible.</hi> For I neither had one, nor scarcely could ever think to see one. Upon which I flung down my Angle and went to meet him. The first place the Book opened in after I took it in my hand, was the Sixteenth Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and the first place my eye pitched on, was the Thirtieth and one and Thirtieth Verses, where the Iailor asked S. <hi>Paul, What must I do to be saved? And he answered saying, Believe in the Lord Iesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved and thine house.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sight of this Book so rejoiced me, and affrighted me together, that I cannot say, which Passion was greater,<note place="margin">Struck into a great Passion at the sight of the Book.</note> the <hi>joy,</hi> for that I had got sight of a <hi>Bible,</hi> or the <hi>fear,</hi> that I had not enough to buy it, having then but one <hi>Pagoda</hi> in the World, which I willingly would have given for it, had it not been for my Boy, who dissuaded me from giving so much, alledging my Necessity for Money many other ways, and undertaking to procure the Book for a far meaner price, provided I would seem to slight it in the sight of the old Man. This counsel after I considered I approved of, my urgent Necessities earnestly crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and my Ability being but very small to relieve the same: and however, I thought, I could give my piece of Gold at the last cast, if other means should fail.</p>
                  <p>I hope the <hi>Readers</hi> will excuse me, that I hold them so long upon this single passage, For it did so affect me then, that I cannot light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pass it over as often as I think of it, or have occasion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it.</p>
                  <p>The sight indeed of this Bible so overjoyed me, as if an Angel had spoke to me from Heaven. To see that my most gracious God had prepared such an extraordinary Blessing for me; which I did, and ever shall look upon as miraculous, to bring unto me a Bible in my own Native Language, and that in such a remote part of the World, where his Name was not so much as known, and where any <hi>English</hi> Man was never known to have been before. I looked upon it, as somewhat of the same nature with the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> he had given the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> out of Heaven; it being the thing for want whereof I had so often mourned, nay and shed tears too; and than the enjoyment whereof there could be no greater joy in the world to me.</p>

hearty thanks that he had brought it so near me, and most earnestly prayed that he would bestow it on me. Now, it being well towards Evening, and not having wherewithal to buy it about me, I departed home, telling the old Man, that in the Morning I would send my Boy to buy it of him.</p>
                  <p>All that Night I could take no rest for thinking on it, fearing lest I might be disappointed of it. In the Morning as soon as it was day, I sent the Boy with a knit Cap he had made for me to buy the Book, praying in my heart for good success, which it pleased God to grant: For that Cap purchased it, and the Boy brought it to me to my great joy, which did not a little comfort me over all my Afflictions.</p>

It was the King's Command concerning them that the People should give them Victuals, and look after them. So they carried each man from house to house to eat, as their turns came to give them Victuals, and where they Supped there they Lodged that Night. Their Bedding was only a Mat upon the Ground.</p>

Which joy was but Abortive, for no sooner did they begin to feel the Comfort of one anothers Company, but immediately their Keepers called upon them to go from whence they came: fearing they might consult and run away, altho <hi>Columbo</hi> the nearest Port they could fly to was above two days Iourney from them. But as it is with wild Beasts beginning to grow tame, their Liberty encreaseth: So it happened to our Men; so that at length they might go and see one another at their pleasures; and were less and less watched and regarded. And seeing they did not attempt to run away, they made no matter of it, if they stayed two or three days one with the other.</p>

For the King's order was to feed them well only, and to look after them until he pleased to send for them. This after some time made them to change their minds, and not to think themselves <hi>Slaves</hi> any more, but the Inhabitants of the Land to be their Servants, in that they laboured to sustain them.</p>
                  <p>Which made them to begin to Domineer, and would not be content unless they had such Victuals as pleased them, and oftentimes used to throw the Pots, Victuals and all at their heads that brought them, which they patiently would bear.</p>

And so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they concluded to do: and by the favour that God gave them in the sight of the People, by alledging the Innocency of their Cause, and the Extremity of their present Condition, having not the least ability to help or relieve themselves, they consented to give them two Measures of Rice a day each man.

For all this while here being no signs of releasing us, it concerned me now to bethink my self how I should live for the future.

Whereby I was inabled the better to speak my mind unto the People that brought me my Victuals. Which was henceforward not to boil my Rice, but to bring it raw according to the quantity that the other <hi>English</hi> men had. This occasioned a great deal of disputing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning between us. They alledged, <hi>That I was not as they, being the Captain's Son, and they but his Servants, and therefore that it was ordered
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:58692:94"/>
by the great Men at Court, that my Victuals should be daily brought unto me, whereas they went always from house to house for theirs: Neither was it fitting for me,</hi> they said, <hi>to imploy my self in such an Inferior Office as to dress my own Meat, being a Man that the King had notice of by Name, and very suddenly before I should be aware of it, would send for me into his Presence, where I should be highly promoted to some Place of Honour.</hi> In the mean time, they told me, as pretending to give me good counsel, <hi>That it was more for my credit and repute to have my Provisions brought unto me ready Dressed as they were before.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Altho I was yet but a <hi>Novice</hi> in the Countrey, and knew not much of the People,<note place="margin">He reasons with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about his allowance.</note> yet plain reason told me, that it was not so much for my good and credit that they pleaded, as for their own benefit. Wherefore I returned them this answer, <hi>That if as they said I was greater in quality than the rest, and so held in their Estimation, it would be but reason to demand a greater allowance, whereas I desired no more than the other English men had. And as for the toyl and trouble in dressing of it, that would be none to me, for my Boy had nothing else to do.</hi> And then I alledged several inconveniencies in bring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the last and chief reason of all was, that I might save a little to serve my Necessity of Clothing: and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than want Cloths for my Back, I must pinch a little out of my Belly, and so both go share and share like. And so at length, thanks be to God, I obtained, tho with much ado, to get two Measures of Rice <hi>per</hi> day for my self, and one for my Boy; also Coker-nuts, Pumpkins, Herbs, Limes, and such like enough, besides Pepper and Salt; and sometimes Hens, Eggs, or Flesh: Rice being the main thing they stand upon, for other things they refuse not to give what they have.</p>

But in doing this I committed a Capital Offence: for none may white their Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with <hi>Lime,</hi> that being peculiar to Royal Houses and Temples. But being a Stranger nothing was made of it, because I did it in ignorance: had it been a Native that had so done, it is most probable it would have cost him his Head, or at the least a great Fine.</p>
                  <p>Being settled in my new House,<note place="margin">He follows bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness and thrives.</note> I began to keep Hogs and Hens; which by God's Blessing thrived very well with me, and were a great help unto me. I had also a great benefit by living in this Garden. For all the Coker-nuts that fell down they gave me, which afforded me Oyl to burn in the Lamp, and also to fry my meat in. Which Oyl being new is but little inferior to this Countrey Butter. Now I learned to knit Caps, which Skill I quickly attained

And out of them made choice of two Lads; whom afterwards he sent and took into his Court. Their honours and their ends we shall see by and by. They were all placed in the City of <hi>Cande,</hi> and each of them had a new Mat given them to sleep on, and their Diet was Victuals dressed and brought them twice a day from the King's own Palace. They had Cloths also distributed to them another time.</p>
                  <p>So that these men had the advantage of us. For we neither had Mats nor Cloths, nor had the honour of being ever brought into the King's Presence.</p>
                  <p>This civil Reception upon their first coming up into the City,<note place="margin">They hoped to obtain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but were mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> put these <hi>Persia Merchant-men</hi> in hope, that the King would give them their Liberty. There was at that time an old <hi>Portugueze Father,</hi> Padre <hi>Vergonse</hi> by name, living in the City. With him they discoursed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the probability of their Liberty, and that the favours the King had shewn them seemed to be good signs of it: but he told them the plain truth, that it was not customary there to release <hi>white Men.</hi> For saying which, they railed at him, calling him <hi>Popish Dog,</hi> and <hi>Iesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rogue,</hi> supposing he spoke as he wished it might be. But afterward to their grief they found it to be true as he told them.</p>
                  <p>Their entertainment was excellently good according to the poor condition of the Countrey,<note place="margin">A ridiculous action of thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore that the King might be informed how they were abused, each man took the Limb of an <hi>Hen</hi> in his hand, and marched rank and file in order thro the Streets with it in their hands to the Court, as a sign to the great Men, whereby they might see, how illy they were served; thinking hereby the King might come to hear of their misusage, and so they might have order to be fed better afterwards. But this proved Sport to the Noblemen who well knew the fare of the Countrey, laughing at their ignorance, to complain where they had so little cause. And indeed afterwards they themselves laughed at this action of theirs, and were half ashamed of it, when they came to a better understanding of the Nature of the Countreys Diet.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithstanding being not used to such short Commons of Flesh,<note place="margin">They had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon which they apply themselves to the old Father abovesaid, desiring him to solve this Case of Conscience. Who was very ready to give them a Dispensation.

The <hi>Iack</hi> Fruit the Kings Officers often gather wheresoever it grows, and give to the Kings Elephants, and they may gather it in any mans grounds without the Owners leave, being for the Kings use. Now these <hi>English</hi> men were appointed to dwell in an house, that formerly belonged unto a Noble man, whom the King had cut off, and seized upon it. In the ground belonging to this House stood a <hi>Iack</hi> Tree full of Fruit. Some of the Kings men came thither to gather some of them to feed the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. But altho the <hi>English</hi> had free liberty to gather what they could eat or desire, yet they would permit none but themselves to meddle with them, but took the Officers by the shoulders and turned them out of the Garden, altho there were more a great many than they could tell what to do with. The Great men were so Civil, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this Affront, they laid no Punishment upon them. But the Event of this was, that a few days after they were removed from this house to another, where was a Garden but no Trees in it. And because they would not allow the King a few, they lost all them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>

Which he not being aware of, went again, and was catched. At which the King was very angry. For he allows none to come to the speech of <hi>Ambassodours,</hi> much less one that served in his presence, and heard and saw all that passed in Court. But yet the King dealt very favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with him. For had it been a <hi>Chingulay,</hi> there is nothing more sure, than that he should have dyed for it. But this <hi>English</hi> mans Punishment was only to be sent away and kept a Prisoner in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains without Chains, and ordered him to be well used there. Where indeed he lived better content than in the Kings Palace. He took a Wife here and had one Son by her, and afterwards dyed by a mischance, which was thus.

In which manner he lay all that Night, being bound so hard that his Arms swelled, and the Ropes cut throw the Flesh into the Bones. The next day the King Commanded a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus he lay some Six Months, and was cured, but had no Strength in his Armes, and then was taken into his Office again, and had as much Favour from the King as before. Who seemed much to lament him for his folly, thus to procure his own ruine.</p>
                  <p>Not long after he again offended the King. Which as it is reported was thus. A <hi>Portugueze</hi> had been sent for to the City to be employed in the Kings Service; to which Service he had no Stomach at all, and was greatly afraid of, as he justly might be. For the avoiding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of it he sends a Letter to this <hi>English</hi> Courtier, whein he entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to use his interest to excuse him to the King. The <hi>English</hi> man could not read the Letter being writ in the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Tongue, but gave it to another to read. Which when he knew the contents of thought it not safe for him to meddle in that business, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the Letter. The person to whom the <hi>English</hi> man had given it to read, some time after informed the King thereof. Whereupon both the <hi>Portugueze</hi> that sent the Letter, and the <hi>English</hi> man to whom it was sent, and the Third Person that read it, because he inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no sooner, were all three at one time and in one place torn in pieces by <hi>Elephants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this Execution the King supposing that we might be either discontented in our selves,<note place="margin">The King sends special order con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their good usage.</note> or discountenanced by the People of the Land, sent special order to all parts where we dwelt, that we should be of good cheer, and not be discouraged, neither abused by the Natives.</p>
                  <p>Thus jealous is the King of Letters, and allows none to come or go. We have seen how dear it cost poor <hi>Henry Man.</hi> Mr. <hi>William Vassal,</hi> another of the <hi>Persia-Merchant</hi> men, was therefore more wary of some Letters he had, and came off better.</p>
                  <p>This man had received several Letters,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Vassals</hi> prudence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receit of Letters.</note> and it was known abroad that he had. Which he fearing lest the King should hear of, thought it most convenient and safe to go to the Court and present them himself; that so he might plead in his own Defence to the King. Which he did. He acknowledged to him that he had received Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that they came to his hands a pretty while ago: but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all pretended excuses and reasons to clear himself. As first, that <hi>when he received them, he knew not that it was against the Law and manner of the Countrey; and when he did know, he took Council of a Portugueze

But he advised him to defer a while the carrying them unto the King until a more convenient season. After this he did attempt, he said, to bring them unto the King, but could not be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have entrance thro the Watches: so that until now, he could not have opportunity to present them.</hi>

After they were read, the King gave <hi>Vassal</hi> a Letter he had intercepted, sent to us from Sir <hi>Edward Winter,</hi> then Agent at Fort St. <hi>George</hi>; and asked the News and Contents thereof. Which Mr, <hi>Vassal</hi> informed him at large of.

The number of Men he computed to be one Ship with another about Three Hundred <hi>per Ship.</hi> At that rate, the King demanded of him, how many that was in all.

At which <hi>Vassal</hi> suspected their Design, which was to learn who had brought those Letters to him; and so framed his answer accordingly, which was that he knew no other.</p>

And he saith, he hath sworn to himself not to divulge it, till he is out of the Kings hands. At parting, the King told him, for Secrecy he would send him home privatly, or otherwise he would have dismist him with Drums and Honour. But after this the King never sent for him again. And the man, that he named as fit and able to carry the Kings Letter, was sent away Prisoner to be kept in Chains in the Countrey. It is supposed, that they concluded him to have been the man that brought <hi>Vassal</hi> his Letters. And thus much of the Captivity and Condition of the <hi>Persia-Merchant</hi> men.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. Concerning the means that were used for our Deliverance. And what happened to us in the Rebellion. And how we were setled afterwards.</head>
                  <p>ALl of us in this manner remained until the year MDCLXIV.<note place="margin">Means made to the King for our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> At which time arrived a Letter on our behalf to the King from the Right Worshipful Sir <hi>Edward Winter,</hi> Governour of Fort St. <hi>George,</hi> and Agent there. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Embassadour also at that time by a Commission from the Governour of <hi>Columba</hi> treated with the King for us. With Sir <hi>Edward</hi>'s Message the King was much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and with the <hi>Dutch</hi>'s mediation so prevailed with, that he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed he would send us away.</p>
                  <p>Upon this, he commanded us all to be brought to the City.<note place="margin">Upon which they all met at the City.</note> Whither when we came, we were very joyful not only upon the hopes of our Liberty, but also upon the sight of one another. For several of us had not seen the others since we were first parted. Here also we met with the <hi>Persia Merchant</hi> men, whom until this time we had not seen. So that we were nine and twenty <hi>English</hi> in all.</p>
                  <p>Some few days after our Arrival at the City, we were all called to the Court.<note place="margin">Word sent them from the Court, that they had their Liberty.</note> At which time standing all of us in one of the Palace Court-yards, the Nobles by command from the King came forth and told us, <hi>that it was his Majesties Pleasure to grant unto us our Liberty, and to send us home to our Countrey, and that we should not any more look upon our selves as Prisoners or detained men.</hi> At which we bowed our heads and thanked his Majesty. They told us moreover, <hi>that the King was intended to send us either with the</hi> Dutch <hi>Embassadour, or by the Boat which Sir</hi> Edward Winter <hi>had sent; and that it was his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties good will to grant us our choice.</hi> We humbly referred it to his Majesties pleasure. They answered, <hi>his Majesty could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd would do his pleasure, but his will was to know our minds.</hi> After a short consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation we answered, <hi>since it was his Majesties pleasure to grant us our choice,</hi> with many Thanks and Obeisance we <hi>chose to go with the</hi> Dutch <hi>Embassadour, fearing the Boats insufficiency,</hi> she having, as we were well sensible, laid there a great while: and if we had chosen the Boat, the danger of going that way might have served them for a Put off to us, and a Plea to detain us still, out of care of us. And again, had we refused the Embassadours kindness at this time, for the future, if these things succeeded not with us now, we could never have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected any more aid or friendship from that Nation.</p>
                  <p>In the next place they told us,<note place="margin">All in general refuse the King's service<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>It was the Kings pleasure to let us understand, that all those that were willing to stay and serve his Majesty, should have very great rewards, as Towns, Monies, Slaves and places of Honour</hi> conferred upon them. Which all in general refused.</p>
                  <p>Then we were bidden to absent, while they returned our answers to the King. By and by there came Order to call us in one at a time, where the former promises were repeated to every one of us of great Favours, Honours and Rewards from the King to those that were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to stay with him. And after each one had given his answer, he was sent into a corner in the Court, and then another called, and so

all round one after another, they inquiring particularly concerning each mans trade and office; Handycrafts-men and Trumpetters being most desired by the King.

At length happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thing a thing which he least suspected, <hi>viz.</hi> a general Rebellion of his People against him. VVho assaulted his Palace in the Night: but their hearts failed them, daring not to enter into the Apartment where his Person was. For if they had had courage enough, they might have taken him there. For he stayed in his Palace until the Morning; and then fled into the Mountains, and escaped their hands, but more thro their cowardliness than his valour. This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion I have related at large in the <hi>second Part,</hi> whither he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to know more of it may have recourse. Only I shall mention here a few things concerning our selves, who were gotten into the midst of these Broils and Combustions, being all of us now waiting upon the King in the City.</p>
                  <p>It was a great and marvellous mercy of Almighty God to bring us safe thro these dangers,<note place="margin">They are in the midst of it, and in great danger.</note> for it so happened all along that we were in the very midst. Before they gave the Assault on the Kings Palace, they were consulting to lay hands on us, fearing lest we might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to their Business, in joyning to the help and assistance of the King against them. For tho we were but few in comparison, yet the Name of <hi>White men</hi> was somewhat dreadful to them. Whereupon at first their Counsels were to cut us off. But others among them advised that it would be better to let us alone; <hi>For that we being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their Designs,</hi> as indeed we were, <hi>and at quiet in our several Lodgings, could not be provided to hurt or indanger them. But otherwise if they should lay hands on us, it would certainly come to the Kings Ears, and Allarm him, and then all would be frustrated and overthrown.</hi> This some of their own Party have related to us since. These Cousels were not given out of any secret good will ny of them bore to us (as I believe) but proceeded from the over ruling hand of God, who put those things into their hearts for our safety and preservation. The People of the City whence the King fled, ran away also leaving their Houses and Goods behind them. Where we found good Prey and Plunder; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing permitted to Ransack the Houses of all such as were fled away with the King.</p>

For the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance which formerly we had was in this Disturbance lost, and so we remained without it for some three Months, the want of which, this Money did help to supply. Having gotten what we could at the Court, we made way to get out of the hurly burly to our Lodgings; intending as we were Strangers and Prisoners, neither to meddle nor make on the one side or the other, being well satisfied, if God would but permit us quietly to sit, and eat such a <hi>Christmas</hi> Dinner together, as he had prepared for us.</p>
                  <p>For our parts we had no other dealings with the Rebels,<note place="margin">The day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned, they fear the King.</note> than to desire them to permit us to go to our Native Countrey, which Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty they promised we should not want long. But being sent for by them to the Court, we durst not but go, and they giving us such things as we wanted, we could not refuse to take them. But the day being turned put us into great fear, doubting how the King would take it at our hands, from whom we knew this could not be hid.</p>
                  <p>Into our Houses we got safely.<note place="margin">But he justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies them.</note> But no sooner were we there, but immediately we were called again by a great Man, who had drawn out his Men, and stood in the Field. This Man we thought had been one of the Rebels, who to secure himself upon this change, had intended to run away down to <hi>Columbo</hi> to the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Which made us repair to him the more cheerfully, leaving our Meat a roasting on the Spit. But it proved otherwise. For no sooner had he gotten us unto him, but he Proclaimed himself for the old King, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he and his Company taking us with him marched away to Fight or seize the Rebels, but meeting none went into the City, and there dismissed us, saying, <hi>He would acquaint the King, how willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy we were to fight for him, if need had required</hi>; altho, God knows, it was the least of our thoughts and intents, yet God brought it to pass for our good. For when the King was informed of what we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Rebels, this piece of good Service that we had done, or rather supposed to have done, was also told unto him. At the hearing of which himself justified us to be innocent; saying, <hi>Since my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, who was there that would give them Victuals</hi>? And, <hi>It was mere
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58692:99"/>
want that made them to take what they did.</hi> Thus the words of the King's own mouth acquitted us. And when the Sword devoured on every side, yet by the Providence of God not one hair of our heads perished.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">They are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to beg in the High-ways.</note>The Tumults being appeased, and the Rebellion vanished, the King was settled in his Throne again. And all this happened in five days time. We were now greatly necessitated for food, and wanted some fresh Orders from the King's mouth for our future subsistence. So that having no other remedy, we were fain to go and lay in the High way that leads to the City a begging; for the People would not let us go any nearer towards the King, as we would have done. There therefore we lay, that the King might come to the knowledge of us, and give Command for our allowance again. By which means we obtained our purpose. For having laid there some two Months, the King was pleased to appoint our Quarters in the Countrey as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not mentioning a word of sending us away, as he had made us believe before the Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sent into new quarters there, and their Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions settled again.</note>Now we were all sent away indeed, but not into our own Countrey, but into new Quarters. Which being God would have to be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we were glad it was so well, being sore a weary of laying in this manner. For for some three Months time we had no manner of allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. We were all now placed one in a Town as formerly, together with the <hi>Persia Merchant</hi> men also, who hitherto had lived in the City of <hi>Cande,</hi> and had their Provisions brought them out of the King's Palace ready dressed. These were now sent away with us into the Countrey. And as strict a charge was given for our good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment as before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Fall to Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and have more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note>We were thus dispersed about the Towns here one and there ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the more convenient receiving our allowance, and for the greater ease of the People. And now we were far better to pass than heretofore, having the Language, and being acquainted with the Manners and Customs of the People, and had the same proportion of Victuals, and the like respect as formerly. And now they fall into employments as they please, either Husbandry or Merchandizing, or knitting Caps, being altogether free to do what they will themselves, and to go where they will, excepting running away: and for that end, we are not permitted to go down to the Sea, but we may tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel all about the Countrey, and no man regards us. For tho the People some of the first years of our Captivity, would scarcely let us go any whither, and had an eye upon us afterwards, yet in process of time all their Suspitions of our going away wore off; especially when several of the <hi>English</hi> had built them Houses, and others had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them Wives, by whom they had Children, to the number of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen living when I came away.</p>

But in the mean time to free my self from the Suspition of the People, who watched me by Night, and by Day, had an eye to all my actions, I went to work with the help of some of my Neighbors to Build me another House upon the Bank of a River, and intrenched it round with a Ditch, and Planted an Hedge: and so began to settle my self; and followed my business in Knitting and going about the Countries a Trading; seeming to be very well contented in this Condition.</p>
                  <p>Lying so long at the City without allowance,<note place="margin">The People counsel him to Marry.</note> I had spent all to some Seven shillings, which served me for a stock to set up again in these new Quarters. And by the Blessing of my most gracious God, which never sailed me in all my Unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I seemed not altogether to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In this place I lived two years;<note place="margin">Here he lived two years.</note> and all that time could not get one likely occasion of running for it. For I thought it better to forbear running too great a hazard by being over-hasty to escape, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive my self of all hopes for the future, when time and experience would be a great help to me.</p>
                  <p>In the year MDCLXVI. the <hi>Hollanders</hi> came up and built a Fort just below me,<note place="margin">A Fort built near him, but afterward ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the King.</note> there being but a ridge of Mountains between them and me. But tho so near, I could not come to them, a Watch being kept at every passage. The King sent down against them two great Commanders with their Armies, but being not strong enough to expel them, they lay in these Watches to stop them from coming up higher. The name of this Fort was called <hi>Arrandery.</hi> Which altho they could not prevent the <hi>Dutch</hi> from building at that time. Yet some years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58692:100"/>
when they were not aware, they fell upon it and took it, and brought all the People of it up to <hi>Cande,</hi> where those that remained alive of them were, when I came from thence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">He and three more removed thence.</note>In this Countrey of <hi>Hotteracourly,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> had built this Fort, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Invasion happening so unexpectedly and our remove so sudden, I was forced to leave behind me that little Estate which God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, lying scattered abroad in <hi>Betel-nuts,</hi> the great Commodity of that Countrey, which I was then parting from: and much ado I had to get my Cloths brought along with me, the Enemies, as they called them, but my Friends being so near. And thus was I carried out of this Countrey as poor as I came into it, leaving all the fruits of my Labour and Industry behind me. Which called to my remembrance the words of <hi>Iob. Naked came I into this world, and naked shall I return: God gave and God hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Settled in a dismal place.</note>We all four were brought up together into a Town on the top of a Mountain called <hi>Laggendenny.</hi> Where I and my dear Friend and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Prisoner, and fellow Batchelor Mr. <hi>Iohn Loveland</hi> lived together in one House. For by this time not many of our People were as we, that is, single men; but seeing so little hopes, despaired of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and had taken Wives or Bedfellows.</p>
                  <p>At our first coming into this Town, we were very much dismayed, it being one of the most dismal places that I have seen upon that Land. It stands alone upon the top of a Mountain, and no other Town near it, and not above four or five Houses in it. And oftentimes into this Town did the King use to send such Malefactors as he was minded sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to cut off. Upon these accounts our being brought to this place could not but scare us, and the more, because it was the King's special Order and Command to place us in this very Town.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the King seemed to apprehend into what a fit of Fear and Sorrow this our Remove would cast us, and to be sensible, how sadly we must needs take it to change a sweet and pleasant Countrey, such as <hi>Handapondown</hi> and the Countrey adjacent was, for this most sad and dismal Mountain. And therefore the next day came a comfortable Message from the King's own mouth, sent by no less Man than he, who had the chief Power and Command over those People who were appointed to give us our Victuals, where we were. This Messag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, which as he said himself, he was ordered by the King to deliver to the People in our hearing, was this, <hi>That they should not think that we were Malefactors, that is, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ch who having incurred the King's displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure were sent to be kept Prisoners there, but men whom his Majesty did highly esteem, and meant to promote to great Honour in his Service, and that they should respect us as such, and entertain us accordingly. And if their ability would not reach thereunto, it was the King's Order,</hi> he said, <hi>to bid them sell their Cattel and Goods, and when that was done their Wives and Children, rather than we should want of our due allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:</hi> which he ordered, should be as formerly we used to have: and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58692:100"/>
if we had not Houses thatched, and sufficient for us to dwell in, he said, <hi>We should change, and take theirs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This kind Order from the King coming so suddenly,<note place="margin">Placed there to punish the People for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Crime.</note> did not a little comfort and encourage us. For then we did perceive the King's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and intent in placing us in those remote Parts, was not to punish us, but them: that we might be his Instruments to Plague and take revenge of that People; who it seems had Plundred the King's Palace in the time of the late Rebellion, when he left it and fled; for this Town lies near unto the same: and their Office lying about the Court they had the fairer opportunity of Plundering it. For the Service they are to perform to the King, is to carry his <hi>Pallenkine</hi> when he pleaseth to ride therein, and also to bring Milk every Morning to the Court, being Keepers of the King's Cattel.</p>
                  <p>In this Town we remained some three years; by which time we were grown quite weary of the place,<note place="margin">Weary of this place.</note> and the place and People also grown weary of us, who were but troublesom Guests to them; for having such great Authority given us over them, we would not lose it; and being four of us in call one of another, we would not permit or suffer them to domineer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> over us. Being thus tired with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Company, and the King's Order being of an old Date, we used all means we could to clear our selves of one another: often repairing unto the Court to seek to obtain a Licence that we might be removed and placed any where else. But there was none that durst grant it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was the King's peculiar Command, and special Appointment that we must abide in that very Town.</p>
                  <p>During the time of our stay here, we had our Victuals brought us in good order and due season: the Inhabitants having such a charge given them by their Governour and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>rom the King, durst not do otherwise. So that we had but little to do, only to dress and eat, and sit down to knit.</p>
                  <p>I had used the utmost of my skill and endeavour to get a Licence to go down to my former Quarters,<note place="margin">By a piece of Craft he gets down to his old Quarters.</note> all things being now pretty well settled, hoping that I might recover some of my old Debts: but by no means could I obtain it. The denial of so reasonable a desire, put me upon taking leave. I was well acquainted with the way, but yet I hired a man to go with me, without which I could not get thro the Watches. For altho I was the Master and he the Man, yet when we came into the Watches, he was the Keeper and I the Prisoner. And by this means we passed without being suspected.</p>
                  <p>Being come into my old Quarters, by pretending that this man was sent down from the Magistrate to see that my Debts and Demands might be duely paid and discharged, I chanced to recover some of them, and the rest gave over for lost; for I never more looked after them. And so I began the world anew,<note place="margin">Began the world anew the third time.</note> and by the Blessing of God was again pretty well recruited before I left this Town.</p>
                  <p>In the time of my residence here, I chanced to hear of a small piece of Land that was to be sold. About which I made very diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. For altho I was sore a weary of living in this Town, yet I could not get out of it, not having other new Quarters appointed me, unless I could provide a place for my self to remove to: which now God had put into my hand. As for the King's Command I dreaded it not much, having found by observation, that the King's Orders wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He inquired, <hi>Whose and what Land it was,</hi> I informed him, <hi>That it had been formerly dedicated to a Priest, and he at his death had left it to his Grandson: who for want was forced to sell it.</hi> Understanding this, the Governor approved of the business, and encouraged me to buy it: saying, <hi>That such kind of Lands only were lawful here to be bought and sold; and that this was not in the least litigious.</hi>

In the Ground besides eight <hi>Coker-nut Trees,</hi> there were all sorts of Fruit Trees the Countrey afforded. But it had been so long desolate, that it was all overgrown with Bushes, and no sign of a House therein.</p>

The terms of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase being concluded on between us, a Writing was made upon a leaf after that Countrey manner, witnessed by seven or eight Men of the best Quality in the Town: which was delivered to me, and I paid the Money, and then took Possession of the Land.

The Countrey People were all well pleased to see us thus busie our selves about buying of Land and Building of Houses, thinking it would ty our Minds the faster to their Countrey, and make us think the less upon our own.</p>

Not long after I found a fit season to be gone to my Estate at <hi>Elledat.</hi> And upon my going, the rest left the Town also, and went and dwelt elsewhere, each one where he best liked. But by this means we all lost a Privilege which we had before: which was that our Victuals were brought unto us, and now we were forced to go and fetch them our selves; the People alledging (true enough) that they were not bound to carry our Provisions about the Country after us.</p>

We were all single men; and we agreed very well together, and were helpful to one another. And for their help and assistance of me, I freely granted them Liberty to use and enjoy whatsoever the ground afforded, as much as my self. And with a joynt consent it was concluded amongst us, <hi>That only single Men and Batchellors should dwell there, and such as would not be conformable to this present agreement, should depart and absent himself from our Society, and also forfeit his right and claim to the forementioned Privilege, that is, to be cut off from all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of whatsoever the Trees and Ground afforded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I thought fit to make such a Covenant, to exclude women from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in among us, to prevent all strife and dissention, and to make all possible Provision for the keeping up love and quietness among our selves.</p>
                  <p>In this manner we four lived together some two years very loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and contentedly, not an ill word passing between us. We used to take turns in keeping at home, while the rest went forth about their Business. For our house stood alone and no Neighbour near it. Therefore we always left one within. The rest of the <hi>English</hi> men lived round about us, some four or five miles distant, some more. So that we were, as it were, within reach one of another; which made us like our present Situation the more.</p>
                  <p>Thus we lived upon the Mountains, being round about us beset with watches, most of our People being now married:<note place="margin">Their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Trade.</note> so that now all talk and suspition of our running away was laid aside. Neither indeed was it scarce possible. The effect of which was, that now we could walk from one to the other, or where we would upon the Mountains, no man molesting or disturbing us in the least. So that we began to go about a Pedling, and Trading in the Country farther towards the Northward, carrying our Caps about to sell.</p>
                  <p>By this time two of our Company seeing but little hopes of Liberty,<note place="margin">His Family reduced to two.</note> thought it too hard a task thus to lead a single life, and married. Which when they had done according to the former agreement departed from us. So that our Company was now reduced to two, <hi>viz.</hi> my Self and <hi>Stephen Rutland</hi>; whose inclination and resolution was as stedfast as mine against Marriage. And we parted not to the last, but came away together.</p>

They reckoning themselves in for their Lives, in order to their future settlement, were generally disposed to Marry. Concerning which we have had many and sundry disputes among our selves; as particularly concerning the lawfulness of matching with Heathens and Idolaters, and whether the <hi>Chingulays</hi> Marriages were any better than living in Whoredome: there being no <hi>Christian Priests</hi> to join them together, and it being allowed by their Laws to change their Wives and take others as often as they pleased.

And when the People in Scripture were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to take Wives of Strangers, it was then when they might intermarry with their own People, and so no necessity lay upon them. And that when they could not, there are examples in the Old Testament upon Record, that they took Wives of the Daughters of the Lands, wherein they dwelt.</hi> These reasons being urged, there was none among us, that could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ought against them, especially if those that were minded to marry Women here, did take them for their Wives during their lives, as some of them say, they do: and most of the Women they marry are such as do profess themselves to be <hi>Christians.</hi>

For that which one part of the Land af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords is a good Commodity to carry to another that wants it. And thus with the help of a little allowance, they make a shift to to subsist. Most of their Wives spin Cotton yarn, which is a great help to them for cloathing, and at spare times also knit.</p>

that are Strangers here, or as any of the Natives themselves, only the Grandees and Courtiers excepted. This I speak to the Praise and Glory of our God; who loves the Stranger in giving him Food and Raiment; and that hath been pleased to give us Favour and a good Repute in the sight of our Enemies. We cannot complain for want of justice in any wrongs we have sustained by the People; or that our cause hath been discountenanced; but rather we have been favoured above the Natives themselves.</p>
                  <p>One of our men happened to be beaten by his Neighbour.<note place="margin">A <hi>Chingulay</hi> punished for beating an <hi>English</hi> man.</note> At which we were all very much concerned, taking it as a reproach to our Nation, and fearing it might embolden others to do the like by the rest of us. Therefore with joint consent we all concluded to go to the Court to complain, and to desire satisfaction from the <hi>Adigar.</hi> Which we did. Upon this the man who had beat the <hi>English</hi> man was summoned in to appear before him. Who seeing so many of us there, and fearing the cause will go very hard with him, to make the Iudg his friend, gave him a bribe. He having received it would have shifted off the Punishment of the Malefactor. But we day after day followed him from house to Court, and from place to place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went, demanding Iustice and Satisfaction for the wrong we received, shewing the black and blew blows upon the <hi>English</hi> mans shoulders to all the rest of the Noble men at Court. He fearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lest the King might be made acquainted herewith was forced tho much against his will to clap the <hi>Chingulay</hi> in Chains. In which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition after he got him, he released him not till besides the former fee he had given him another.</p>

But the <hi>Portugueze</hi> not caring to be under the Command of a <hi>Dutch-man,</hi> desired a Captain of their own Nation, which the King granted, studying to please them at this time.

It was now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year MDCLXXII. I related before, that my family was reduced to two, my self and one honest man more, we lived solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and contentedly being well setled in a good House of my own. Now we fell to breeding up <hi>Goats</hi>: we began with two, but by the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God they soon came to a good many; and their Flesh served us instead of Mutton. We kept Hens and Hogs also: And seeing no sudden likelihood of Liberty, we went about to make all things hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and convenient about us: which might be serviceable to us, while we lived there, and might farther our Liberty whensoever we should see an occasion to attempt it: which it did, in taking away all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the People concerning us: who not having Wives as the o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers had, they might well think, lay the readier to take any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to make an escape. Which indeed we two did Plot and Consult about, between our selves with all imaginable Privacy, long before we we go away: and therefore we laboured by all means to hide our designs; and to free them from so much as suspition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:58692:103"/>We had now brought our House and Ground to such a perfection that few Noble mens Seats in the Land did excel us. On each side was a great Thorn-Gate for entrance,<note place="margin">A description of his House.</note> which is the manner in that Countrey: the Gates of the City are of the same. We built also ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther House in the Yard all open for Air, for our selves to sit in, or any Neighbours that came to talk with us. For seldome should we be alone, our Neighbours oftner frequenting our House than we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired; out of whom to be sure we could pick no Profit. For their coming is always either to beg or borrow. For altho we were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Prisoners in their Land, yet they would confess that Almighty God had dealt far more bountifully with us than with them, in that we had a far greater plenty of all things than they.</p>
                  <p>I now began to set up a new Trade.<note place="margin">He takes up a new Trade and Thrives on it.</note> For the Trade of Knitting was grown dead, and Husbandry I could not follow, not having a Wife to help and assist me therein, a great part of Husbandry properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the woman to manage. VVhereupon I perceived a Trade in use among them, which was to lend out Corn. The benefit of which is fifty <hi>per cent. per annum.</hi> This I saw to be the easiest and most profitable way of Living, whereupon I took in hand to follow it: and what stock I had, I converted into Corn or Rice in the Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>k. And now as customers came for Corn, I let them have it, to receive their next Harvest, when their own Corn was ripe, the same quantity I lent them, and half as much more. But as the Profit is great, so is the trouble of getting it in also. For he that useth this Trade must watch when the Debtors Field is ripe, and claim his due in time, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise other Creditors coming before will seize all upon the account of their Debts, and leave no Corn at all for those that came later. For these that come thus a borrowing, generally carry none of their Corn home when it is ripe, for their Creditors ease them of that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by coming into their Fields and taking it, and commonly they have not half enough to pay what they ow. So that they that miss get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ther Debts this year must stay till the next when it will be double, two measures for one: but the Interest never runs up higher, tho the Debt lye seven years unpaid. By means hereof I was put to a great deal of trouble, and was forced to watch early and late to get my Debts, and many times miss of them after all my Pains. Howbeit when my Stock did encrease that I had dealings with many, I matter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not if I lost in some places, the profit of the rest was sufficient to bear that out.</p>
                  <p>And thus by the Blessing of God my little was encreased to a great deal. For he had blessed me so, that I was able to lend to my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and had no need to borrow of them. So that I might use the words of <hi>Iacob,</hi> not out of Pride of my self, but thankfulness to God, <hi>That he brought me hither with my Staff and blessed me so here, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came two Bands.</hi>

For if I should be put to Death only because I refused his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I should be pitied as one that dyed innocently; but if I should be executed in his Service, however innocent I was, I should be certainly reckon'd a <hi>Rebel</hi> and a <hi>Traytor,</hi> as they all are whom he commands to be cut off.</p>
                  <p>Upon these considerations having thus set my resolutions,<note place="margin">The answer he makes to the Great man.</note> as God enabled me, I returned him this answer: First, <hi>That the English Nation to whom I belonged had never done any violence or wrong to their King either in word or deed.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That the causes of my coming on their Land was not like to that of other Nations, who were either Enemies taken in War, or such as by reason of poverty or distress, were driven to sue for relief out of the Kings bountiful liberality, or such as fled for the fear of deserved punishment; Whereas,</hi> as they all well knew, <hi>I came not upon any of these causes, but upon account of Trade, and came ashore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Kings Orders, which by notice we understood were come concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, and to render an account to the</hi> Dissauva <hi>of the Reasons and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of our coming into the Kings Port.

                  <p>It was now about the year M DCL XXIII. Altho I had now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many years in this Land, and God be praised, I wanted for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the Land afforded, yet could I not forget my native Countrey <hi>England,</hi> and lamented under the Famine of Gods Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the want whereof I found greater than all earthly wants: and my dayly and fervent Prayers to God were, in his good time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store me to the enjoyment of them.</p>
                  <p>I and my Companion were still meditating upon our escape and the means to compass it.<note place="margin">Their pedling forwarded their escape.</note> Which our pedling about the Countrey did greatly forward and promote. For speaking well the Language and going with our Commodities from place to place, we used often to entertain discourse with the Countrey people; <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the ways and the Countreys, and where there were most and fewest inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and where and how the <hi>Watches</hi> laid from one Countrey to another; and what Commodities were proper to carry from one part to the other, pretending we would from time to time go from one place to another, to furnish our selves with ware that the respective places afforded. None doubted but we had made these inquiries for the sake of our Trade, but our selves had other designs in them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there the least suspition of us for these our questions: all sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing I would never run away and leave such an estate as in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts and esteem I had.</p>
                  <p>By diligent inquiry I had come to understand,<note place="margin">The most probable course to take, was Northwards,</note> that the easiest and most probable way to make an escape was by travailing to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that part of the Land being least inhabited. Therefore we furnished our selves with such wares as were vendible in those parts, as <hi>Tobacco, Pepper, Garlick, Combs,</hi> all sorts of <hi>Iron Ware,</hi> &amp;c. and being laden with these things, we two set forth, bending our course towards the Northern Parts of the Island, knowing very little of the way; and the ways of this Countrey generally are intricate and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: here being no great High-ways that run thro the Land, but a multitude of little Paths, some from one Town to another, some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fields, and some into the Woods where they sow their Corn; and the whole Countrey covered with Woods, that a man cannot see any thing but just before him. And that which makes them most difficult of all, is, that the ways shift and alter, new ways often made and old ways stopped up. For they cut down Woods, and sow the ground, and having got one Crop off from it, they leave it, and Wood soon grows over it again: and in case a Road went thro those Woods, they stop it, and contrive another way; neither do they regard tho it goes two or three miles about: and to ask and inquire the way for us <hi>white men</hi> is very dangerous, it occasioning the People to suspect us. And the <hi>Chingulays</hi> themselves never Travail in Countreys where they are not experienced in the ways without a guide, it being so difficult. And there was no getting a guide to conduct us down to the Sea.</p>
                  <p>But we made a shift to travail from <hi>Cande Vda</hi> downwards towards the North from Town to Town;<note place="margin">They get three days journey North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> happening at a place at last which I knew before, having been brought up formerly from <hi>Cooswat</hi> that way, to descend the Hill called <hi>Bocaul,</hi> where there is no <hi>Watch,</hi> but

                  <p>We were not a little glad that we were gotten so far onwards in our way, but yet at this time we could go no farther; for our ware was all sold, and we could pretend no more excuses; and also we had been out so long, that it might cause our Towns-men to come and look after us, it being the first time that we had been so long absent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

For this Northern Countrey being much subject to dry weather, and having no springs, we were fain to drink of Ponds of Rain water, wherein the Cattel lie and tumble, which would be so thick and muddy, that the very filth would hang in our Beards when we drank. This did not agree with our Bodies, being used to drink pure Spring water only. By which means when we first used those parts we used often to be Sick of violent Favors and Agues, when we came home. Which Diseases happened not only to us, but to all other People that dwelt upon the Mountains, as we did, whensoever they went down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those places; and commonly the major part of those that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At which the <hi>Chingulays</hi> are so scared, that it is very seldom they do adventure their Bodies down thither: neither truly would I have done it, were it not for those future hopes, which God of his mercy did at length accomplish. For both of us smarted sufficiently by those severe Favors we got, when we should both lay Sick toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one not able to help the other. Insomuch that our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Neighbours used to ask us, if we went thither purposing to destroy our selves, they little thinking, and we not daring to tell them our intent and design.</p>

But it so fell out, that at the very precise time, all things being ready to depart on the morrow, it pleased God, whose time was not yet come, to strike me with a most grievous pain in the hollow on my right side, that for five days together I was not able to stir from the fire side, but by warming it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore if he would please to supply us either for such Ware as we had brought, or else for our Money, it would be a great favour, the which would oblige us for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to bring him any necessaries that he should name unto us, when we should come again unto those Parts, as we used to do very often: and that we could furnish him, having dealings and being acquainted with the best Artificers in</hi> Cande.</p>
                  <p>At which he replyed, <hi>That he was sorry we were come at such a dry time, wherein they could not catch Deer, but if some Rain fell, he would soon dispatch us with our Ladings of Flesh. But however,</hi> he bade us <hi>go about the Towns, and see whether there might be any or no, tho he thought there was none.</hi> This answer of his pleased us wondrous well, both because by this we saw he suspected us not, and because he told us there was no dryed Flesh to be got. For it was one of our greatest fears that we should get our Lading too soon: for then, we could not have had an excuse to go further. And as yet we could not possibly fly: having still six miles further to the Northward to go before we could attempt it, that is, to <hi>Anarodgburro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From <hi>Anarodgburro</hi> it is two dayes Iourney further thro a desolate Wilderness before there is any more Inhabitants.<note place="margin">Their danger by reason of the ways they were to pass.</note> And these Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are neither under this King nor the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but are <hi>Malabars,</hi> and are under a Prince of their own. This People we were sorely afraid of, lest they might seize us and send us back, there being a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between this Prince and the King of <hi>Cande</hi>; wherefore it was our endeavour by all means to shun them; lest according to the old Proverb, <hi>We might leap out of the Frying pan into the Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we must take care of that as well as we could when we came among them,<note place="margin">They still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at the Governours, to prevent suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for as yet our care was to get to <hi>Anarodgburro.</hi> Where altho it was our desire to get, yet we would not seem to be too hasty, lest it might occasion suspition: but lay where we were two or three dayes: and one stay'd at the Governors House a knitting, whilst the other went about among the Towns to see for Flesh. The Ponds in the Country being now dry, there was Fish every where in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:58692:108"/>
which they dry like red Herrings over a fire. They offered to sell us store of them, but <hi>they,</hi> we told them, <hi>would not turn to so good profit as Flesh. The which,</hi> we said, <hi>we would have, tho we stayed ten dayes longer for it. For here we could live as cheap, and earn as much as if we were at home, by our knitting.</hi> So we seemed to them as if we were not in any hast.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">An accident that now crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them great fear.</note>In the mean time happened an Accident which put us to a great fright. For the King having newly clapped up several Persons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, whereof my old Neighbour <hi>Ova Motteral,</hi> that sent for me to Court, was one, sent down Souldiers to this <hi>High Sheriff</hi> or Governor, at whose house we now were, to give him order to set a secure Guard at the Watches, that no suspitious persons might pass. This he did to prevent the Relations of these imprisoned persons from making an Escape, who thro fear of the King might attempt it. This always is the Kings custome to do. But it put us into an exceeding fear, lest it might beget an admiration in these Soldiers to see <hi>White men</hi> so low down: which indeed is not customary nor allowed of: and so they might send us up again. Which doubtless they would have done, had it not been of God by this means and after this manner to deliver us. Especially considering that the King's Command came just at that time and so expresly to keep a secure Guard at the Watches, and that in that very Way that alwayes we purposed to go in: so that it seemed scarcely possible for us to pass afterwards, tho we should get off fairly at present with the Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">But get fairly rid of it.</note>Which we did. For they having delivered their Message, departed, shewing themselves very kind and civil unto us. And we seemed to lament for our hard fortune, that we were not ready to go upwards with them in their good company: for we were Neighbours dwelling in one and the same County. However we bid them carry our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations to our Countrymen the <hi>English,</hi> with whom they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted at the City, and so bad them <hi>farewel.</hi> And glad we were when they were gone from us. And the next day in the morning we resolved, God willing, to set forward. But we thought not fit to tell our Host, the Governor, of it, till the very instant of our depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he might not have any time to deliberate concerning us.</p>
                  <p>That Night he being disposed to be merry, sent for people whose trade it is to dance and shew tricks, to come to his house to entertain him with their Sports. The beholding them spent most part of the Night. Which we merrily called our <hi>Old Host's Civility</hi> to us at our last parting: as it proved indeed, tho he, honest man, then little dreamed of any such thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">They get away fairly from the Governour.</note>The morning being come, we first took care to fill our Bellies; then we packed up those things which were necessary for our Iourney to carry with us, and the rest of our Goods, Cotton Yarn, and Cloth and other things, that we would not incumber our selves withall, we bound up in a Bundle, intending to leave them behind us. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, I went to the Governor, and carried him four or five charges of Gunpowder, a thing somewhat scarce with them, intreating him rather than we should be disappointed of Flesh, to make use of that and shoot some Deer; which he was very willing to accept of, and to us it could be no wayes profitable, not having a Gun. While <hi>we,</hi> we told him, <hi>would make a step to</hi> Anarodgburro <hi>to see what Flesh we could
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:58692:108"/>
procure there.</hi> In the mean time, according as we had before layd the business, came <hi>Stephen</hi> with the Bundle of Goods, desiring to leave them in his house, till we came back. Which he was very ready to grant us leave to do. And seeing us leave such a parcel of Goods, tho, God knowes, but of little account in themselves, yet of considerable value in that Land, he could not suppose otherwise but that we were intended to return again. Thus we took our leaves, and immediately departed, not giving him time to consider with himself, or consult with others about us. And he like a good natured man bid us heartily <hi>farewel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Altho we knew not the way to this Town, having never been there in all our lives, and durst not ask, lest it might breed suspition; yet we went on confidently thro a desolate Wood: and happened to go very right, and came out directly at the place.</p>
                  <p>But in our way before we arrived hither, we came up with a small River,<note place="margin">In their way they meet with a River which they found for their purpose.</note> which ran thro the Woods, called by the <hi>Chingulayes Malwat oyah</hi>: the which we viewed well, and judged it might be a probable guide to carry us down to the Sea, if a better did not present. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we thought good to try first the way we were taking, and to go onward towards <hi>Anarodgburro,</hi> that being the shortest and easiest way to get to the Coast: and this River being as under our <hi>Lee,</hi> ready to serve and assist us, if other means failed.</p>
                  <p>To <hi>Anarodgburro</hi> therefore we came, called also <hi>Neur Waug.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <p>They come safely to <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodgburro.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
                     </note> Which is not so much a particular single <hi>Town,</hi> as a <hi>Territory.</hi> It is a vast great <hi>Plain,</hi> the like I never saw in all that Island: in the midst where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a Lake, which may be a mile over, not natural, but made by art, as other Ponds in the Country, to serve them to water their Corn Grounds. This Plain is encompassed round with Woods, and small Towns among them on every side, inhabited by <hi>Malabars,</hi> a distinct People from the <hi>Chingulayes.</hi> But these Towns we could not see till we came in among them. Being come out thro the Woods into this Plain, we stood looking and staring round about us, but knew not where nor which way to go. At length we heard a Cock crow, which was a sure sign to us that there was a Town hard by; into which we were resolved to enter. For standing thus amazed, was the ready way to be taken up for suspitious persons, especially because <hi>White men</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come down so low.</p>
                  <p>Being entred into this Town, we sate our selves under a Tree,<note place="margin">The People stand amazed at them.</note> and proclaimed our Wares, for we feared to rush into their Yards, as we used to do in other places, lest we should scare them. The People stood amazed as soon as they saw us, being originally <hi>Malabars,</hi> tho Subjects of <hi>Cande.</hi> Nor could they understand the <hi>Chingulay</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in which we spake to them. And we stood looking one upon another until there came one that could speak the <hi>Chingulay</hi> Tongue: Who asked us, <hi>from whence we came?</hi> We told him, <hi>From Cande Vda.</hi> But they believed us not, supposing that we came up from the <hi>Dutch</hi> from <hi>Manaar.</hi> So they brought us before their Governor.<note place="margin">They are exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Governour of the Place.</note> He not speaking <hi>Chingulais,</hi> spake to us by an Interpreter. And to know the truth, whether we came from the place we pretended, he inquired about News at Court; demanded, <hi>Who were Governors of such and such Countreys?</hi> and <hi>what was become of some certain Noble-men,</hi> whom the King had lately cut off? and also <hi>What the common people were employed
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:58692:109"/>
about at Court,</hi> for it is seldom that they are idle. To all which we gave satisfactory answers. Then he enquired of us, <hi>Who gave us leave to come down so low?</hi> We told him, <hi>That priviledg was given to us by the King himself full Fifteen Years since at his Palace at</hi> Nellemby, <hi>when he caused it to be declared unto us, that we were no longer prisoners, and</hi> (which indeed was our own addition) <hi>that we were free to enjoy the benefit of Trade in all his Dominions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To prove and confirm the truth of which, we alledged the distance of the Way that we were now come from home, being near an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles, passing thro several Counties, where we met with several Governors and Officers in their respective Iurisdictions; who had they not been well sensible of these Priviledges granted us, would not have allowed us to pass thro their Countries. All which Officers we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to him by name; and also that now we came from the <hi>High Sheriff's</hi> House at <hi>Colliwilla,</hi> where we had been these three dayes, and there heard of the Order that was come to secure the Watches; which was not for fear of the running away of <hi>White men,</hi> but of the <hi>Chingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes.</hi> These Reasons gave him full satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">Provide things necessary for their flight.</note>The People were very glad of our coming, and gave us an end of an open house to ly in: but at present they had no dryed Flesh, but desired us to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To prevent the least surmise that we were Plotting to run away, we agreed, that <hi>Stephen</hi> should stay in the house by the things, while I with some few went abroad; pretending to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for dryed Flesh to carry back with us to <hi>Cande,</hi> but intending to make discoveries of the way, and provide necessaries for our Flight, as <hi>Rice,</hi> a <hi>Brass Pot</hi> to boil our Rice in, a little dryed <hi>Flesh</hi> to eat, and a <hi>Deers-skin</hi> to make us Shooes of. And by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of my gracious God, all these things I happened upon and bought. But as our good hap was, <hi>Deers-Flesh</hi> we could meet with none. So that we had time enough to fit our selves; all People think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we stayed only to buy Flesh.</p>

                     </gap>ere we stayed three days; during which we had found the great Road that runs down towards <hi>Iafnapatan,</hi> one of the Northern Ports belonging to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which Road we judged led also towards <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naar</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Northern Port also, which was the Place that we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to get to, lying above two or three days Iourney distant from us. But in this Road there was a Watch lay, which must be passed. Where this Watch was placed, it was necessary for us punctually to know, and to endeavour to get a sight of it. And if we could do this, our intent was to go unseen by Night, the people being then afraid to travayl, and being come up to the Watch, to slip aside into the Woods, and so go on untill we were past it; and then strike into the Road again. But this Project came to nothing, because I could not without suspition and danger go and view this Watch; which layd some four or five miles below this Plain; and so far I could not frame any business to go.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:58692:109"/>But several inconveniences we saw here, insomuch that we found it would not be safe for us to go down in this Road. For if we should have slipt away from them by Night, in the Morning we should be missed, and then most surely they would go that way to chace us, and ten to one overtake us, being but one Night before them. Also we knew not whether or no, it might lead us into the Countrey of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labar</hi> Prince, of whom we were much afraid.</p>
                  <p>Then resolving to let the great Road alone, we thought of going right down thro the VVoods, and steer our course by the Sun and Moon: but the Ground being so dry we feared we should not meet with VVater. So we declined that Counsel also. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in doubt, we prayed God to direct us, and to put it into our hearts which way to take.<note place="margin">Resolve to go back to the River they lately passed.</note> Then after a Consultation between our selves, all things considered, we concluded it the best course to go back to <hi>Malwat oyah,</hi> the River we had well viewed that lay in our way as we came hither. And back thither we resolved to repair.</p>

                  <p>NOw God of his Mercy having prospered our Design hitherto,<note place="margin">They depart back again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the River.</note> for which we blessed his Holy Name, our next care was how to come off clear from the People of <hi>Anarodgburro,</hi> that they might not presently miss us, and so pursue after us. Which if they should do, there would have been no escaping them. For from this Town to <hi>Colliwilla,</hi> where the Sheriff lived, with whom we left our Goods, they are as well acquainted in the Woods as in the Paths. And when we came away we must tell the People, that we were going thither, because there is no other way but that. Now our fear was, lest upon some occasion or other any Men might chance to Travel that way soon after we were gone, and not finding us at <hi>Colliwilla,</hi> might conclude, as they could do no otherwise, that we were run into the Woods. Therefore to avoid this Danger, we stayed in the Town till it was so late, that we knew none durst venture to Travel afterwards for fear of wild Beasts. By which means we were sure to gain a Nights Travel at least, if they should chance to pursue us.</p>
                  <p>So we took our leaves of the Governor,<note place="margin">But first take their leave of the Governor here.</note> who kindly gave us a Pot of Milk to drink for a farewel; we telling him, <hi>We were returning back to the Sheriff at</hi> Colliwilla, <hi>to whom we had given some Gunpowder when we came from him to shoot us some Deer, and we doubted not but by that time we should get to him, he would have provided flesh enough for our lading home.</hi> Thus bidding him and the rest of the Neighbours <hi>fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> we departed, they giving us the Civility of their accustomed Prayers, <hi>Diabac</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It was now the Twelfth day of <hi>October</hi> on a Sunday,<note place="margin">They begin their flight.</note> the Moon eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days old. We were well furnished with all things needful, which
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:58692:110"/>
we could get, <hi>Viz.</hi> Ten days Provision, <hi>Rice, Flesh, Fish, Pepper, Salt,</hi> a <hi>Bason</hi> to boil our Victuals in, two <hi>Calabasses</hi> to fetch Water, two great <hi>Tallipats</hi> for Tents, big enough to sleep under if it should rain, <hi>Iaggory</hi> and <hi>Sweet-meats,</hi> which we brought from home with us, <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco</hi> also and <hi>Betel, Tinder-Boxes</hi> two or three for failing, and a <hi>Deers Skin</hi> to make us Shooes, to prevent any Thorns running into our feet as we travelled through the Woods; for our greatest Trust under God was to our feet. Our Weapons were, each man a small Axe fastned to a long Staff in our hands, and a good Knife by our sides. Which were sufficient with God's help to defend us from the Assaults of either Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or Bear; and as for Elephants there is no standing against them, but the best defence is to flee from them.</p>
                  <p>In this Posture and Equipage we marched forward. When we were come within a Mile of this River, it being about Four in the Evening, we began to fear, lest any of the People of <hi>Anarodgburro</hi> from whence we came, should follow us to <hi>Colliwella.</hi> Which place we never intended to come at more: the River along which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to go, laying on this side of it. That we might be secure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that no People came after us, we sat down upon a Rock by a hole that was full of water in the High-way; until it was so late, that we were sure no People durst Travel. In case any had come after us, and seen us sitting there and gotten no further, we intended to tell them, That one of us was taken Sick by the way, and therefore not able to go. But it was our happy chance there came none. So about Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down we took up our Sacks of Provisions, and marched forward for the River,<note place="margin">
                        <p>They come to the River a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long which they resolved to go.</p>
                        <p>Which they travel along by till it was dark.</p>
                     </note> which under God we had pitched upon to be our guide down to the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Being come at the River, we left the Road, and struck into the Woods by the River side. We were exceeding careful not to tread on the Sand or soft Ground, lest our footsteps should be seen; and where it could not be avoided, we went backwards, so that by the print of our feet, it seemed as if we had gone the contrary way. We were now gotten a good way into the Wood; when it grew dark and began to Rain, so that we thought it best to pitch our Tents, and get Wood for Firing before it was all wet, and too dark to find it. Which we did, and kindled a fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Now they fit themselves for their Iourney.</note>Then we began to fit our selves for our Iourney against the Moon arose. All our Sale-wares which we had left we cast away, (for we took care not to sell too much) keeping only Provisions and what was very necessary for our Iourney. About our Feet we tied pieces of Deers-hide to prevent Thorns and Stumps annoying our feet. We al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways used to Travel bare-foot, but now being to travel by Night and in the Woods, we feared so to do. For if our feet should fail us now, we were quite undone. And by the time we had well-fitted our selves, and were refreshed with a Morsel of <hi>Portuguez</hi> Sweet-meats, the Moon began to shine. So having commended our selves into the hands of the Almighty, we took up our Provisions upon our shoulders, and set forward, and travelled some three or four hours, but with a great deal of difficulty; for the Trees being thick, the Moon gave but little light thro, but our resolution was to keep going.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Meeting with an Elephant they took up for that night.</note>Now it was our chance to meet with an Elephant in our way just before us: which we tryed, but could not scare away: so he forced us
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:58692:110"/>
to stay. We kindled a Fire and sate down, and took a Pipe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> waiting till Morning. Then we looked round about us, and it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all like a Wilderness, and no sign that People ever had been there: which put us in great hopes that we had gained our Passage, and were past all the Inhabitants. Whereupon we concluded that we were now in no danger of being seen, and might Travel in the Day securely. There was only one great Road in our way, which led to <hi>Portaloon</hi> from the Towns which by and by we fell into; this Road therefore we were shy of, lest when we passed it over, some Passengers travelling in it, might see us; and this Road we were in expectance about this time to meet withal, secure, as I said before, of all other danger of People. But the River winding about to the Northward brought us into the midst of a parcel of Towns called <hi>Tissea Wava,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">They fall in among Town<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap> before they are aware.</note> before we were aware. For the Countrey being all Woods, we could not discern where there were Towns, until we came within the hearing of them. That which betrayed us into this danger was, that meeting with a Path, which only led from one Town to another, we concluded it to be that great Road above mentioned; and so having past it over, we supposed the Danger we might encounter in being seen, was also past over with it; but we were mistaken; for going further we still met with other Paths, which we crossed over, still hoping one or other of them was that great Road; but at last we perceived our Error; <hi>viz.</hi> That they were only Paths that went from one Town to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>And so while we were avoiding Men and Towns, we ran into the midst of them. This was a great trouble to us, hearing the Noise of People round about us, and knew not how to avoid them; into whose hands we knew if we had fallen, they would have carried us up to the King, besides Beating and Plundring us to boot.</p>
                  <p>We knew before that these Towns were here away, but had we known that this River turned and run in among them, we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have undertaken the Enterprize. But now to go back, after we had newly passed so many Paths, and Fields and places where People did resort, we thought not advisable, and that the danger in so doing might be greater than in going forward. And had we known so much then, as afterwards did appear to us, it had been safer for us to have gone on, than to have hid there as we did; which we then thought was the best course we could take for the present extremity: <hi>viz.</hi> To secure our selves in secret until Night, and then to run thro in the dark. All that we now wanted was a hole to creep in to lye close, for the Woods thereabouts were thin, and no shrubs or bushes, under which we might be concealed.</p>

And then we crossed that great Road, which all the day before we did expect to come up with, keeping close by the River side, and going so long till dark Night stopped us. We kept going the longer, because we heard the Voice of Men hollowing towards Evening: which created us a fresh disturbance, thinking them to be People that were coming to chace us. But at length we heard Elephants behind us, between us and the Voice, which we knew by the noise of cracking the Boughs and small Trees, which they break down and eat. These Elephants were a very good Guard behind us, and were methought like the Darkness that came between <hi>Israel</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> For the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we knew would not dare to go forwards hearing Elephants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">They meet with many of their Tents.</note>And indeed all along as we went, by the sides of the River till we came to the <hi>Malabar</hi> Inhabitants, had been the Tents of <hi>wild Men,</hi> made only of Boughs of Trees. But God be praised, they were all gone, tho but very lately before we came: as we perceived by the Bones of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and shells of Fruit, which lay scattered about. We supposed that want of water had driven them out of the Countrey down to the River side, but since it had rained a shower or two they were gone again.<note place="margin">Very near fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the wild People.</note> Once about Noon sitting down upon a Rock by the River side to take a Pipe of Tobacco and rest our selves; we had almost been discovered by the Women of these wild People, coming down, as I suppose, to wash themselves in the River. Who being many of them, came talking and laughing together. At the first hearing of the noise being a good distance, we marvailed what it was: sitting still and listning, it came nearer a little above where we sat; and at last we could plainly distinguish it to be the Voices of Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Whereupon we thought it no boot to sit longer, since we could escape undiscovered, and so took up our Bags and fled as fast as we could.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">What kind of travelling they had.</note>Thus we kept travelling every day from Morning till Night, still along by the River side, which turned and winded very crooked.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58692:111"/>
In some places it would be pretty good Travelling, and but few Bushes and Thorns, and in others a great many. So that our Shoulders and Arms were all of a Gore, being grievously torn and scratched. For we had nothing on us but a clout about our Middles, and our Victuals on our Shoulders, and in our hands a Tallipat and an Ax.</p>
                  <p>The lower we came down this River,<note place="margin">Some account of this River.</note> the less Water, so that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we could go a Mile or two upon the Sand, and in some places three or four Rivers would all meet together. When it happened so, and was Noon, the Sun over our head, and the Water not running, we could not tell which to follow, but were forced to stay till the Sun was fallen, thereby to judge of our course. We often met with Bears, Hogs, Deer, and wild Buffaloes, but all ran so soon as they saw us. But Elephants we met with no more than that I mentioned before. The River is exceeding full of <hi>Aligators</hi> all a long as we went; the upper part of it nothing but Rocks. Here and there by the side of this River is a world of hevvn Stone Pillars, standing upright,<note place="margin">Ruins.</note> and other heaps of hevvn Stones, vvhich I suppose formerly were Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And in three or four places are the ruins of Bridges built of Stone; some Remains of them yet standing upon Stone Pillars. In many places are <hi>Points</hi> built out into the River like Wharfs, all of hewn Stone; which I suppose have been built for Kings to sit upon for Pleasure. For I cannot think they ever were employed for Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick by VVater; the River being so full of Rocks that Boats could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come up into it.</p>
                  <p>The VVoods in all these Northern Parts are short and shrubbed,<note place="margin">The Woods hereabouts.</note> and so they are by the River side, and the lower the worse; and the Grounds so also.</p>
                  <p>In the Evenings we used to pitch our Tent,<note place="margin">How they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a nights against wild Beasts.</note> and make a great Fire both before and behind us, that the wild Beasts might have notice where we lay; and we used to hear the Voices of all sorts of them, but, thanks be to God, none ever came near to hurt us. Yet we were the more wary of them, because once a Tiger shewed us a cheat. For having bought a Deer, and having nothing to salt it up in, we packed it up in the Hide thereof salted, and laid it under a Bench in an open House, on which I lay that Night, and <hi>Stephen</hi> layd just by it on the Ground, and some three People more lay then in the same House; and in the said House a great Fire, and another in the Yard. Yet a Tiger came in the Night, and carried Deer and Hide and all away. But we missing it, concluded it was a Thief. VVe called up the People that lay by us, and told them what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. Who informed us that it was a Tiger, and with a Torch they went to see which way he had gone, and presently found some of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> which he let drop by the way. VVhen it was day we went further, and pickt up more which was scattered, till we came to the Hide it self, which remained uneaten.</p>
                  <p>We had now Travelled till <hi>Thursday</hi> Afternoon,<note place="margin">They pass the River that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from the <hi>Malabars.</hi>

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58692:112"/>
So we marched along in the River upon the Sand. Hereabouts are far more Elephants than higher up: by Day we saw none, but by Night the River is full of them.</p>

So that great was our terror again, lest meeting with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we might be discovered. Yet there was no means now left us how to avoid the Danger of being seen. The VVoods were so bad, that we could not possibly Travel in them for Thorns: and to Travel by Night was impossible, it being a dark Moon, and the River a Nights so full of Elephants and other wild Beasts coming to drink; as we did both hear and see laying upon the Banks with a Fire by us. They came in such Numbers because there was VVater for them no where else to be had, the Ponds and holes of VVater, nay the River it self in many places being dry.</p>

                     <note place="margin">As yet undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</note>There was therefore no other way to be taken but to Travel on in the River.

Then offering to go towards them, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be naked men and no Arms near them, we laid our Axes upon the ground with our Bags, lest we might scare them, if we had come up to them with those weapons in our hands, and so went towards them with only our Knives by our sides: by signs with our hands shewing them our bloody Backs we made them understand whence we came, and whither we were going.

Where were great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, and a fair and sumptuous House inhabited by <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> People; we being then in such Habit and Guize, our Natural colour excepted, that we seemed not fit to eat with his Servants, no nor his Slaves.</p>
                  <p>After Dinner the Captain inquired concerning the Affairs of the King and Countrey,<note place="margin">Who intended them to Sail the next day to <hi>Iafnapatan.</hi>
                     </note> and the condition of their Ambassadors and People there. To all which we gave them true and satisfactory Answers. Then he told us, That to Morrow there was a Sloop to sail to <hi>Iafnapatan,</hi> in which he would send us to the Commander or Governor, from whence we might have passage to Fort St. <hi>George,</hi> or any other place on that Coast, according to our desire. After this, he gave us some Money, bidding us go to the Castle, to drink and be merry with our Country-men there. For all which kindness giving him many thanks in the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Language, we took our leaves of him.</p>

To all his Questions my too much Experience inabled me to give a satisfactory Reply. Some of the most remarkable matters he demanded of me were these.</p>
                  <p>First, They inquired much about the reason and intent of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Cuttiar.</hi> To which I answered them at large. Then they asked, <hi>If the King of</hi> Cande <hi>had any Issue</hi>? I told them, <hi>As report went, he had none.</hi> And, <hi>Who were the greatest in the Realm next to him</hi>? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. <hi>There were none of Renown left, the King had destroyed them all. How the hearts of the People stood affected?</hi> I answered, <hi>Much against their King. He being so cruel. If we had never been brought into his presence?</hi> I told them, <hi>No, nor had ever had a near <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>ight of him. What strength he had for War.</hi> I answered, <hi>Not well able to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault them, by reason the hearts of his People were not true to him. But that the strength of his Countrey consisted in Mountains and Woods, as much as in the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What Army he could raise upon occasion?</hi> I answered, <hi>I knew not well, but as I thought about Thirty Thousand men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why he would not make Peace with them, they so much sueing for it, and sending Presents to please him</hi>? I answered, <hi>I was not one of his Council, and knew not his meaning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they demanded of me, <hi>What I thought might be the reason or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it?</hi> I answered, <hi>Living securely in the Mountains he feareth none; and for Traffick he regardeth it not.</hi>

                     <hi>Which way was best and most secure to send Spyes or Intelligence to Cande?</hi> I told them, <hi>By the way that goeth to</hi> Iafniputtan, <hi>and by some of that Countrey People, who have great correspondence with the People of</hi> Neurecaulava, <hi>one of the King's Countries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What I thought would become of that Land after this King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease?</hi> I told them, <hi>I thought, He having no Issue, it might fall into their hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How many English men had served the King, and what became of them?</hi> which I gave them an account of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether I had any Acquaintance or Discourse with the great Men at Court?</hi> I answered, <hi>That I was too small to have any Friendship or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy, or hold Discourse with them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How the common People used to talk concerning them?</hi> I answered, <hi>They used much to commend their Iustice and good Government in the Territories, and over the People belonging unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether the King did take Counsel of any, or rule and act only by his own will and pleasure?</hi> I answered, <hi>I was a Stranger at Court, and how could I know that?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But,</hi> they asked further, <hi>What was my Opinion?</hi> I replied, <hi>He is so great, that there is none great enough to give him counsel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>French, If the King knew not of their coming before they came</hi>? I ansvvered, <hi>I thought, not, because their coming seemed strange and wonderful unto the People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How they had proceeded in treating with the King?</hi> I ansvvered, as shall be related hereafter; vvhen I come to speak of the <hi>French</hi> detained in this Land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If I knew any way or means to be used whereby the Prisoners in</hi> Cande <hi>might be set free?</hi> I told them, <hi>Means I knew none, unless they could do it by War.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also they enquired about the manner of Executing those whom the King commands to be put to Death. They enquired also very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously concerning the manner of our Surprizal, and Entertainment or Usage among them. And in what parts of the Land we had our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence. And particularly, concerning my self: in what Parts of the Land, and how long in each I had dwelt, and after what manner I lived there, and of my Age; and in what Part or Place when God sends me home, I should take up my abode. To all which I gave answers.</p>
                  <p>They desired to know also, how many <hi>English</hi> men there were yet remaining behind. I gave them an account of Sixteen Men, and also of Eighteen Children born there. They much enquired concerning their Embassadors detained there, and of their behaviour and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of living; also what the King allowed them for Maintenance; and concerning several Officers of Quality Prisoners there, and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral about all the rest of their Nation. And <hi>what Countenance the King shewed to those Dutch men that came running away to him?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, <hi>The Dutch Runnawayes the King looks upon as Rogues.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Portugueze</hi> they enquired also. I told them, <hi>The</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze <hi>were about some fifty or threescore persons, and six or seven of those,</hi> Europe <hi>men born.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They asked me moreover, How we had made our Escape, and which way, and by what Towns we passed, and how long we were in our Iourney? To all which I answered at large.</p>

                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:58692:115"/>Then the Governor asked me, <hi>What was my intent and desire?</hi> I told him, <hi>To have Passage to our own Nation at Fort</hi> S. GEORGE. To which he answered, <hi>That suddenly the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>where the General his Father would be very glad to see us.</hi> Which was not in our power to deny. Then he commanded to call a <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain, who was over the Countreys adjacent, subject to their jurisdiction. To him he gave Order to take us home to his House, and there well to entertain us, and also to send for a Tailor to make us Cloths.<note place="margin">Cloths them.</note> Upon which I told him, his Kindness shewn us already was more than we could have desired; it would be a sufficient favour now to supply us with a little Money upon a Bill to be paid at Fort <hi>S.

And when the King lately sent an Army against the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> this Prince let them pass thro his Countrey; and went himself in Person to direct the King's People, when they took one or two Forts from them.</p>

But they come up into <hi>Neure Caulava</hi> yearly with great droves of Cattel, and lade both Corn and Cotton. And to buy these they bring up Cloth made of the same Cotton, which they can make better than the <hi>Chingulays:</hi> also they bring Salt and Salt Fish, and brass Basons, and other Commodities, which they get of the <hi>Hollander</hi>: because the King permits not his People to have any manner of Trade with the <hi>Hollander:</hi> so they receive the <hi>Dutch</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities at the second hand.</p>

The King's Promises took effect; and they all revolted from the General. The King now daring not to trust the Revolted, to make tryal of their Truth and Fidelity, put them in the forefront of his Battel, and commanded them to give the first Onset. the King at that time might have Twenty or Thirty thousand Men in the Field. Who taking their opportunity, set upon the <hi>Portugueze</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and gave them such a total overthrow, that as they report in that Countrey not one of them escaped. The General seeing this Defeat, and himself like to be taken, called his Black Boy to give him water to drink, and snatching the Knife that stuck by his Boy's side, stabbed himself with it.<note place="margin">He loses a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory and stabs himself.</note>

The King afterwards took this <hi>Lewis TissÃ©ra,</hi> and put him in Chains in the Common Goal, and made him eat of the same fare. And there is a <hi>Ballad</hi> of this Man and this passage, Sung much among the common People there to this day.</p>

of the Kings coming he was informed, that it was a day sooner than really it happened. According to this information he resolved pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly to march thither, and come upon him in the night unawares.

The <hi>Chingulays</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seiged the Fort: and knowing the <hi>Dutch</hi> had no Water there; but all they had was conveyed thro a Trench wrought under Ground from a River near by, they beseiged them so close, and planted so many Guns towards the mouth of this Trench, that they could not come out to fetch Water. They cut down Wood also, and made bundles of Faggots therewith, which they piled up round about their Fort at some distance, and every night removed them nearer and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. So that their works became higher than the Fort. Their main intent by these Faggot-works, was to have brought them just under the Fort, and then to have set it on Fire, the Walls of the Fort being for the most part of Wood. There was also a <hi>Bo-gahah</hi> Tree growing just by the Fort: on which they planted Guns and shot right down into them. The houses in the Fort being Thatched, they shot also

Fire-Arrows among them: So that the beseiged were forced to pull off the Straw from their Houses, which proved a great inconvenience to them being a Rainy Season: so that they lay open to the weather and cold. The <hi>Dutch</hi> finding themselves in this extremity desired quarter which was granted them at the Kings mercy. They came out and laid down their Arms, all but the Officers, who still wore theirs.

Three of these, whose Names were <hi>Monsieur Du Plessy,</hi> Son to a Gentleman of note in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Iean Bloom,</hi> the third whose Name I cannot tell, but was the Ambassador's Boy, the King appointed to look to his best Horse, kept in the Palace.

And as soon as they were at home, the King sent a Banquet after them of Sweetmeats and Fruits to eat together. They did eat the King's Banquet, but it would not make the Reconcilement. For after they had done, each man went home and dwelt in their own Houses as they did before. It was thought that this carriage would offend the King, and that he would at least take away their Allowance. And it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before this time the King hath taken Vengeance on them. But the Ambassador's carriage is so imperious, that they would rather venture whatsoever might follow than be subject to him.

                        <body>
                           <p>THese may acquaint your Excellency, That having been a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner in the Island of <hi>Ceilon,</hi> under the King of that Countrey near Twenty years; by means of this my long detainment there, I became acquainted with the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador, and the other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen his Retinue; being in all Eight Persons; who was sent to Treat with the said King in the Year <hi>MDCLXXII.</hi> by Monsieur <hi>De la Hay,</hi> who came with a Fleet to the Port of <hi>Cotiar</hi> or <hi>Trinke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malay,</hi> from whence he sent these Gentlemen. And knowing that from thence it is scarce possible to send any Letters or Notice to other Parts, for in all the time of my Captivity I could never send one word, whereby my Friends here might come to hear of my Condition, until with one more I made an Escape, leaving Sixteen <hi>English</hi> men yet there; The Kindness I have received from those <hi>French</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as also my Compassion for them, being detained in the same place with me, hath obliged and constrained me, to presume to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your Lordship with this Paper; not knowing any other means whereby I might convey Notice to their Friends and Relations, which is all the Service I am able to perform for them. The Ambassador's Name I know not; there is a Kinsman of his called <hi>Monsieur le Serle,</hi> and a yong Gentleman called <hi>Monsieur du Plessey,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther named <hi>Monsieur la Roche.</hi> The rest by Name I know not. <hi>And then an account of them is given according to what I have mentioned above.</hi> I shall not presume to be farther tedious to your Honour; craving Pardon for my boldness, which my Affection to those Gentlemen being detained in the same Land with me hath occasioned.

                  <p>The Ambassador upon the receipt of this, desired to speak with me.. Upon whom I waited, and he after some Speech with me told me he would send word into <hi>France</hi> of it, and gave me Thanks for this my Kindness to his Countreymen.</p>

                     <note place="margin">An inquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reason of this King's detaing <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paeans.</hi>
                     </note>It may be worth some inquiry, what the reason might be, that the King detains the <hi>Europaean</hi> People as he does. It cannot be out of hope of Profit or Advantage; for they are so far from bringing him any, that they are a very great Charge, being all maintained either by him or his People. Neither is it in the power of Money to redeem any one, for that he neither needs nor values. Which makes me conclude, it is not out of Profit, nor Envy or ill will, but out of Love and Favour, that he keeps them, delighting in their Company, and to have them ready at his Command. For he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ambitious of the Service of these Men, and winks at many of their failings, more than he uses to do towards his Natural Subjects. As may appear from a Company of <hi>White Soldiers</hi> he hath,<note place="margin">The King's gentleness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his white Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> who upon their Watch used to be very negligent, one lying Drunk here and another there. Which remisness in his own Soldiers he would scarce have indured, but it would have cost them their
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:58692:122"/>
lives. But with these he useth more Craft than Severity to make them more watchful.</p>
                  <p>These Soldiers are under two Captains, the one a <hi>Dutch</hi> man and the other a <hi>Portugueze.</hi> They are appointed to Guard one of the King's Magazines,<note place="margin">They watch at his Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine.</note> where they always keep Sentinel both by Day and Night. This is a pretty good distance from the Court, and here it was the King contrived their Station, that they might swear and swagger out of his hearing, and that no body might disturb them, nor they no body. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain lyes at one side of the Gate, and the <hi>Portugueze</hi> at the other.</p>
                  <p>Once the King to employ these his <hi>white Soldiers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How craftily the King cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their Negligence.</note> and to honour them by letting them see what an assurance he reposed in them, sent one of his Boys thither to be kept Prisoner, which they were very Proud of. They kept him two years, in which time he had learnt both the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Portugueze</hi> Language. Afterwards the King retook the Boy into his Service, and within a short time after Executed him. But the King's reason in sending this Boy to be kept by these Soldiers was, probably not as they supposed, and as the King himself outwardly pretended, <hi>viz.</hi> To shew how much he confided in them, but out of Design to make them look the better to their Watch, which their Debauchery made them very remiss in. For the Prisoners Hands only were in Chains, and not his Legs; so that his possibility of running away, having his Legs at liberty, concerned them to be circumspect and wakeful. And they knew if he had escaped it were as much as their lives were worth. By this crafty and kind way did the King correct the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of his <hi>white Soldiers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed his inclinations are much towards the <hi>Europaeans</hi>;<note place="margin">The King's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations are towards white Men.</note> making them his great Officers, accounting them more faithful and trusty than his own People. With these he often discourses concerning the Affairs of their Countreys, and promotes them to places far above their Ability, and sometimes their Degree or Desert. And indeed all over the Land they do bear as it were a natural respect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>White Men,</hi>

                  <p>And as further signs of the King's favour to them,<note place="margin">Their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege above the Natives.</note> there are many Privileges, which <hi>White Men</hi> have and enjoy, as tolerated or allowed them from the King; which I suppose may proceed from the aforesaid Consideration; as, to wear any manner of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, either Gold, Silver, or Silk, Shoes and Stockings, a shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Belt and Sword; their Houses may be whitened with Lime, and many such like things, all which the <hi>Chingulayes</hi> are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to do.</p>

They are greatly chargeable unto his Countrey, but he regards it not in the least. So that the People are more like Slaves unto us than we unto the King. In as much as they are inforced by his Command to bring us main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Whose Poverty is so great oftentimes, that for want of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:58692:123"/>
what they supply us with, themselves, their Wives, and Children, are forced to suffer hunger, this being as a due Tax imposed upon them to pay unto us. Neither can they by any Power or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority refuse the Payment hereof to us. For in my own hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People once complaining of their Poverty and Inability to give us any longer our Allowance, the Magistrate or Governor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, It was the King's special Command, and who durst disannul it. And if otherwise they could not supply us with our mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he bad them sell their Wives and Children, rather than we should want of our due. Such is the favour that Almighty God hath given Christian People in the sight of this Heathen King; whose entertainment and usage of them is thus favourable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">How they maintain Christianity among them.</note>If any enquire into the Religious exercise and Worship practised among the Christians here, I am sorry I must say it, I can give but a slender account. For they have no Churches nor no Priests, and so no meetings together on the Lord's Dayes for Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but each one Reads or Prays at his own House as he is dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. They <hi>Sanctifie</hi> the Day chiefly by refraining work, and meeting together at Drinking-houses. They continue the practice of <hi>Baptism</hi>; and there being no Priests, they Baptize their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren themselves with Water, and use the words, <hi>In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost</hi>; and give them Christian Names. They have their Friends about them at such a time, and make a small Feast according to their Ability: and some teach their Children to say their Prayers, and to Read, and some do not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In some things they comply with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Heathen.</note>Indeed their Religion at the best is but Negative, that is, they are not Heathen, they do not comply with the Idolatry here pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised; and they profess themselves Christians in a general man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which appears by their <hi>Names,</hi> and by their <hi>Beads</hi> and <hi>Crosses</hi> that some of them wear about their Necks. Nor indeed can I wholly clear them from complyance with the Religion of the Countrey. For some of them when they are Sick do use the Ceremonies which the Heathen do in the like case, as in making Idols of clay, and setting them up in their Houses, and Offering Rice to them, and having Weavers to Dance before them. But they are ashamed to be known to do this; and I have known none to do it, but such as are <hi>Indians</hi> born. Yet I never knew any of them, that do inwardly in Heart and Conscience incline to the ways of the Heathen, but perfectly abhor them: nor have there been any, I ever heard of, that came to their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon any Religious account, but only would stand by and look on;<note place="margin">An old Priest used to eat of their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> without it were one old Priest named <hi>Padre Vergonce,</hi> a <hi>Genoez</hi> born, and of the <hi>Iesuits</hi> Order, who would go to the Temples, and eat with the Weavers and other ordinary People of the Sacrifices offered to the Idols: but with this Apology for himself, <hi>that he eat it as common Meat, and as God's Creature, and that it was never the worse for their Superstition that had past upon it.</hi> But however this may reflect upon the Father, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing may be related for his Honour. There happened two Priests to fall into the hands of the King; on whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred great Honours; for having laid aside their Habits they
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:58692:123"/>
kept about his Person, and were the greatest Favourites at Court. The King one day sent for <hi>Vergonse,</hi> and asked him, if it would not be better for him to lay aside his old Coat and Cap, and to do as the other two Priests had done, and receive Honour from him. He replied to the King, <hi>That he boasted more in that old habit and in the Name of</hi> Iesus, <hi>than in all the honour that he could do him.</hi> And so refused the King's Honour. The King va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued the Father for this saying. He had a pretty Library about him, and died in his Bed of old Age: whereas the two other Priests in the King's Service died miserably, one of a <hi>Canker,</hi> and the other was slain. The old Priest had about Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These Priests, and more lived there, but all deceased, excepting <hi>Vergonse,</hi> before my time. The King allowed them to build a Church;<note place="margin">The King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the <hi>Portugueze</hi> to build a Church.</note> which they did, and the <hi>Portugueze</hi> assembled there, but they made no better than a Bawdy-house of it; for which cause the King commanded to pull it down.</p>
                  <p>Although here be <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists,</hi> yet here are no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences kept up among them, but they are as good Friends, as if there were no such Parties.
