            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Censures? A <hi>Scandall</hi> in an high degree! It offends those that are weake in the Church, and makes them to suspect our Doctrine it selfe, to see our Rites so que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable: It abuses the good that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and makes some imagine, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t their filial conscience is nothing else, but a time-serving policy: It hinders the strong too, and consumes their time, to recall a wilfull son, which should be spent to gaine a forrein Enemy. But, I see 'tis with the Church, as with our Saviour: He is neglected at home, and yet from the East men come to reverence him: and, for our Liturgy, tis sure with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets works, as with their persons, <hi>They are not without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Some there are indeed, who still cry out of Weakness, who sit not easie, though on their Mothers Knees. They complain, her cloaths do offend their tender eyes, her <hi>Rites</hi> (they say) are <hi>scandalous,</hi> and they must be reliev'd by that Text in S. <hi>Paul: If meate offend my Brother, I will eate no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58905:34"/>
But is the reason the same? To eat, is a private action in common converse, wherein each man is true Lord of himselfe, he may command his actions, and therefore (in this case) to use conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vences is still to be thought most commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; nay, S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Example hath bound us to do it. But, we speake of actions pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, solemnly designed for our Religious Meetings, actions injoyn'd by <hi>Lawes,</hi> and approved by the far more, which is the Rule of <hi>Lawes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And must Statuts be altered upon the suggestion of each private subject? or <hi>Cannons,</hi> upon the unresolved thoughts of each Private voluntary? this course would soone bring a kingdom to ruine, and a Church into confusion. Should we give such content to these few that dislike, we should displease multitudes that approve our Ceremonies; and so, instead of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended slight offence, we should run our selves upon a true grosse <hi>Scandall.</hi> Those who cry out so much, <hi>Their weakness is offended,</hi> should be mindfull of this our Precept too, <hi>Give ye none offence to the whole Church of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, these weak men, when meane they to grow strong? <hi>Si nunquam grande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scunt,

Com.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 32.) And it is plain, that these have had Time and Meanes to learne that these things are indifferent; and will they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or (rather) refuse instruction? If they neglect it, then that of the <hi>Civilian</hi> holds: <hi>Data culpa aequiparatur dolo</hi>: There is guilt in this gross negligence. And if they refuse it, the <hi>Casuists</hi> agree, that in this case, <hi>Scandalum pusillorum fit Pharisaeorum,</hi> when men will not heare, their infirmities turn pure malice, and of <hi>weak Christians</hi> they become <hi>stout Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi> and then we are taught to offend such men from our Lords own Example.</p>

dangerous an Expedition?

VVhat needs that place inflame devotion? his heart's of stone, that melts not to think upon the <hi>Grave</hi>; and he is worse then dull, who then frames not as many pious thoughts, as he here reads circumstances.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There is a conceit in the world (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) speakes little better of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, then this: and that is, That <hi>God should designe many thousands of soules to H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eir faults, but to his own absolute will and power, and to get him glory in their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> This opinion is growne huge and monstrous (like a <hi>Goliah</hi>) and men doe shake and tremble at it; yet never a man reacheth to <hi>Davids</hi> sling to cast it downe. In the name of the <hi>Lord of Hosts</hi>: we will encounter it; for it hath reviled, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Host of the living God, but the <hi>Lord of Hosts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, it is directly opposite to this <hi>Text</hi> of holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> and so turns the <hi>Truth</hi> of God into a <hi>Lye.</hi> For whereas God in this Text doth say and swear, that he doth not delight in the <hi>death</hi> of man: this opinion saith, that not one or two, but millions of men should fry in <hi>Hell</hi>; and that he made them for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, then to be the children of <hi>death</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> and that, for no other cause, but his meer pleasure's sake; and so saies, that God did not only <hi>say,</hi> but <hi>swear</hi> to a <hi>Lye</hi>; for the <hi>Oath</hi> should have run thus: <hi>As I live (saith the Lord) I do delight in the death of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly it doth (not by consequence, but) directly make God the Author of sin. For, if God, without eye to sin, did designe men to Hell, then did he say
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58905:76"/>
and set downe, that he should sin: for without sin he cannot come to <hi>Hell</hi>: And indeed doth not his opinion say, that the Almighty God in the eye of his Counsell, did not only see, but say, that <hi>Adam</hi> should <hi>fall,</hi> and so order and decree, and set downe his <hi>fall,</hi> that it was no more possible for him not to <hi>fall,</hi> then it was possible for him not to <hi>eat</hi>? and of that which God doth order, set down, and decree (I trust) he is the Author: unless they will say, that when the Right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> doth say in open Court, <hi>We order,</hi> he means not to be the Authour of that his order.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It takes a way from <hi>Adam</hi> (in his state of innocency) all freedome of will, and liberty not to sin. For, had he had freedome to have altered Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sigment, <hi>Adams</hi> Liberty had bene above the designment of God. And here I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a little witty <hi>Solution</hi> is made: that is, if we respect <hi>Adam's will,</hi> he had power to sin, or not to sin; but if <hi>God's Decree,</hi> he could not but sin. This is a silly <hi>solution</hi>: And indeed it is as much, as if you should take a sound strong man (that hath power to walke and to lie still) and bind him hand and foot (as they do in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58905:77"/>
               <hi>Bedlam</hi>) and lay him downe; and then bid him <hi>Rise up</hi> and <hi>Walke</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or else you will stir him up with a Whip; and he tell you that there be chains upon him, so that he is not able to stir: and you tell him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that that is no excuse, for if he look upon his heal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, his strength, his legs, he hath power to walk or to lie still; but if upon his chains, indeed in that respect he is not able to walk: I trust, he that should whip that man for not walking, were well worthy to be whipt himselfe. Or (if you will give <hi>Adams</hi> will a little more scope) this pritty solution makes it as a bird in a Cage, and the dore fast shut: if you look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p on the wings of the Bird, she hath power to flie and flap away; but if you turne your eye and looke to the Wicke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the Cage, you may well see, that she may flutter thither but she can get no further. Almighty Gods <hi>Decree</hi> is stronger then the <hi>Wicket</hi> and <hi>Chains</hi> too; for he that made the bonds of <hi>Ori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> so sure, that no man can loose them, hath made the bonds of his <hi>Decree</hi> so sure, that no man can break them: and therefore if God set i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> downe for a <hi>Decree,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> should fall, <hi>Adam</hi> had no more liberty not to fall, then the <hi>man</hi> in the chains had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58905:77"/>
to walk, or the <hi>Bird</hi> in the Cage liberty to fly away.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, as God doth abhor a heart and a heart, and his soule detesteth a double-minded <hi>man</hi>: So himselfe cannot have a mind and a mind, a face (like <hi>Ianus</hi>) to look two waies. Yet, this opinion maketh in God two <hi>Wills,</hi> the one flat opposite to the other: An <hi>Hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den will,</hi> by which he appointed, and willed that <hi>Adam</hi> should sin; and an <hi>Open will,</hi> by which he forbad him to sin. <hi>His open will</hi> said to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise: Adam thou shalt not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </item>
               <item>2. No man is of an absolute necessity the childe of <hi>Hell,</hi> so as by God's Grace, he may not avoid it.</item>

               <item>5. God's Son offereth Grace effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to save every one, and to direct him to the Kingdom of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. The neglect and contempt of his Grace, is the cause why every one doth not come to <hi>Heaven</hi>; and not any privative Decree, Counsel, or determination of God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These six I will breifly discuss, and so commend you to the Grace of God.</p>
            <p>For the first, Almigty God at the Creation, when he tooke a view of all his Creatures (as men use to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that have newly drawne an Image, they view and pry to see what is amisse in it) it seemes, when he looked upon them he found they were <hi>Good</hi>; and when <hi>Man</hi> was made, behold, <hi>They were very Good, Gen.</hi> 1.31.

            <p>The second consequence is: <hi>No man is of absolute necessity the child of Hell, so as by God's grace he may not avoid it.</hi> And this is a sprig of the former Branch: For, if God cannot hate any man, but for <hi>sin,</hi> and himselfe cannot delight in <hi>sin</hi>; then can he not delight that any man should go to Hell, but he that delighteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to die in <hi>sin.</hi> Let us look back to the <hi>Garden</hi> from whence wee came: God planted in the <hi>Gardan</hi> of <hi>
