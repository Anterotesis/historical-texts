         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Letters I here publiſh, are an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable
Evidence of the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi>'s having been in ſuch Bondage to
the Pope, that tho it had been never
ſo well diſpoſed, it was not in its Power to have
reformed the Church: But to open that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
better, a ſhort and faithful Account of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
that have been made on the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Councils by the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
here followeth, ſeems to be no improper Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to the reading of them.</p>
            <p>The Catholick Church being a Society inſtituted
by Chriſt, into which the People of all Nations
having ſubmitted themſelves to him as their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
were to be admitted; Chriſt muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
be ſuppoſed, at the ſame time that he erected
his Church into a Society, to have preſcribed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Form of Government to it, with a Power to
make ſuch Laws and Orders as ſhould be neceſſary
to its Preſervation; as alſo to puniſh ſuch of its
Members as ſhould obſtinately deny any of the
great Truths, or tranſgreſs any of the known Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57465:4"/>
which upon their admiſſion into it, they did
ſolemnly promiſe and vow to believe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p>Now this being ſuppoſed, which of the three
Forms of Government, Democracy, Monarchy,
or Ariſtocracy, is the beſt, in having the feweſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
attending it, about which People
may wrangle to Eternity without ever coming to
any Agreement, is not the Queſtion here; but
the true Queſtion is, Under which of theſe Forms
of Government Chriſt when he founded his
Church did put it.</p>
            <p>As to Democracy, it neither was nor could be
the Form of Government under which Chriſt put
his Church, and that for this Reaſon, becauſe that
Form of Government, if it can any ways ſubſiſt,
muſt have its Subjects near together; whereas
Chriſt deſigned that his Church ſhould ſpread it
ſelf over the whole Earth, as it did over a great
part of it within a few Years after it was firſt
founded.</p>
            <p>As to Monarchy, it is true it might, if Chriſt
had ſo thought fit, have been the Form of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of his Church; but it is as certain that
he did not ordain it to be its Government, as it is,
that the Apoſtles did not immediately after his
Aſcenſion, change the Government that he had
inſtituted; which if it is a thing not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
Chriſt muſt then have put his Church under
an Ariſtocracy, it being very plain from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that that was the Form of Government the
Church was under in the Apoſtles Days.</p>
            <p>So the firſt time the Church after it was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
acted as a Body that we read of, was, when
the Apoſtles and Elders aſſembled together to
quench a Diſſenſion ariſen among Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Circumciſion, and ſome other Moſaical
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57465:4"/>
Obſervances, <hi>Acts</hi> the <hi>15th,</hi> in which Aſſembly it
is plain, that the Church acted as an Ariſtocracy:
And tho it is moſt probable that St. <hi>James,</hi> and
not St. <hi>Peter,</hi> was the Preſident of this Council,
yet whoever was, it is certain he did not preſide
therein as a Monarch, but as a Fellow-Judg with
the reſt of his Brethren.</p>
            <p>According to which Apoſtolical Pattern, the
Paſtors and Governours of the Church who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the Apoſtles, as often as there was occaſion,
uſed to meet together in Councils to treat about
the Affairs of their reſpective Churches, making
ſuch Laws and Canons, and inflicting ſuch Cenſures
as the Neceſſities of the Church required: All
which was done without the leaſt Syllable of the
Church having a Monarch ſet over it on Earth by
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus the Church was governed in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all places for
near 300 Years by Provincial Councils of Biſhops:
Not that Presbyters, nay nor Lay-Chriſtians were
wholly excluded from thoſe Aſſemblies; the Lay-Members
of the Church, when ſhe is under an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel
Civil Government, being in the place of the
Civil Magiſtrate to her: nevertheleſs it is certain
that the Biſhops, as of a ſuperior Degree to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
had always the chief Authority in all ſuch
Aſſemblies, and had probably a Negative upon
the reſt.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>4th</hi> Century, the Church being bleſſed
with Chriſtian Emperors, began to meet by her
Biſhops in Oecumenical or General Councils, which
was an Advantage ſhe had not before enjoy'd, it
not being a thing to be expected, that Princes of
a contrary Religion ſhould ſuffer ſuch Aſſemblies
to meet under their Noſes.</p>
            <p>All which General Councils acted, and were
juſtly eſteemed by all Chriſtians to be the Supream
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57465:5"/>
Legiſlative Authority of the Church: and they
looking upon themſelves as ſuch, condemned He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,
and made Canons about Diſcipline; and
in a word, did every thing that belonged to the
Eccleſiaſtical Legiſlative Power; and that without
ever taking the leaſt notice of an Authority on
Earth that was ſuperior to theirs, or of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of any particular Prelats, as neceſſary to the
validating of their Determinations. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
thoſe Reverend Aſſemblies were all called
by the Emperors, who in their Convocation of
them, appointed the Place where, and the Time
when they were to meet, ſending ſome of the
graveſt of their Senators to aſſiſt at them, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
them; and diſſolving them when they had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
what they were called to do. All which
was done without any Proteſtations having ever
been made againſt it by any Biſhop, as an Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon his Eccleſiaſtical Prerogative. Nay,
thoſe Councils were ſo far from dreaming of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s having that Monarchical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Church which he now pretends to have,
that that Prelat, tho he had often and earneſtly
deſired it, could never get one of thoſe Aſſemblies
to meet in the Weſt where his See was. And as
to the Canons and Determinations of thoſe Bodies,
they were ſo far from thinking that Biſhop's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to them to be neceſſary, that they made ſome
not only without it, but contrary to it: Witneſs
the <hi>30th</hi> Canon of the Council of <hi>Calcedon;</hi> in which
any one that will look into it, may plainly ſee what
the Fathers in the <hi>5th</hi> Century univerſally, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be the Foundation of any Primacy, or rather
Precedency, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had; and in
caſe that Prelat happened to be convicted by them
of Hereſy, they condemned him with the ſame
freedom as they would have done any other Prelat,
as they did <hi>Honorius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57465:5"/>
All which, if true, as it is a clear Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that thoſe Councils look'd upon themſelves as
the Supream Legiſlative Authority of the Church,
ſo the Truth of the whole thereof is ſo manifeſt
from the publick Acts of thoſe Aſſemblies, that
there cannot be a greater Inſtance of an invincible
Hardineſs againſt the brighteſt Evidence than that
the Roman Champions give, in affirming the Pope
to have always had the ſame Authority he now
pretends to, and that he exerciſed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of <hi>Trent</hi> over General Councils: His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Pretenſions being,</p>
            <p>1. That the Power of Calling, Suſpending,
Tranſlating and Diſſolving General Councils is
ſolely in him.</p>
            <p>2. That he is the ſole Judg when the Calling of
ſuch Aſſemblies is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>3. That he can give a Right to vote in them to
Eccleſiaſticks who are not Biſhops, and to as many
as he pleaſeth, which he has actually done to great
Numbers of Abbots, and to the Generals of
the Religious Orders, and to ſuch Cardinals who
are but Deacons.</p>
            <p>4. That none ought to ſit and vote in a General
Council, that have not on ſome occaſion or other
taken an Oath of Obedience to him.</p>
            <p>5. That he is to preſide in them, either in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or by his Legats, and that with ſuch an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Authority, that nothing can be ſo much as
propoſed in them, by any but by him or his Legats.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That nothing that is done in them is of
any Validity until he has confirmed it.</p>
            <p>Having named theſe Pretenſions, it would be to
affront the Reader, to offer to prove to him, that
the Aſſemblies that ſubmit themſelves to them, can
have no Authority, and that the Church in her
Body Repreſentative is made thereby, what <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetan</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57465:6"/>
ſaith ſhe is, <hi>the Pope's Servant or Slave, and
not his Mother.</hi>

            <p>And as it is a thing worth any ones enquiry, how
this great Change in the Government of the Church
was brought about, ſo to the beſt of my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it was by theſe following Steps, that the Popes
aſcended to this Pinnacle of Eccleſiaſtical Tyranny.</p>
            <p>1. As to the Power of Calling and Diſſolving
General Councils, the thing that brought that
into his Hands, was the breaking of the Roman
Empire into ſeveral independent Kingdoms and
Commonwealths; by which means it coming not
to be in the Power of any one Prince, as it was
formerly, to call all the Biſhops to a Council, the
Pope ſeized upon it; and having once got it, he
took care to keep it as one of the chief Jewels of
his Crown; for the ſake of which, and divers other
Advantages which accrued to the Papacy, by the
breaking of the Roman Empire into ſo many inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Principalities, the Popes will always take
care to keep thoſe Principalities from ever conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidating
again into one great Monarchy: a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Monarchy being a thing the Popes will
never truſt either their <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Moſt Chriſtian
Son</hi> withal, how zealous ſoever they may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
appear to be for their Religion.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Step towards this Eccleſiaſtical Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
was the Pope's ſtretching that Honorary
Primacy of Order, that was given him in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils purely on the Conſideration of
<hi>Rome</hi>'s being the chief City in the Empire, to a
Primacy of Juriſdiction over thoſe Aſſemblies;
which was the eaſier done through that prodigious
Ignorance of antient Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory which
reigned for ſome Ages in the Weſt.</p>
            <p>The third was, thoſe groſs Impoſtures of the
<hi>Decretal Epiſtles</hi> which were forged in the ninth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57465:6"/>
Century, on purpoſe to advance the Papal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
they being univerſally believed to have been
written by the antient Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> on whom
they were fathered.</p>
            <p>The fourth was, the Weſtern Church after its
having broke off Communion with all other
Churches, coming to look upon it ſelf as the whole
Catholick Church; by which means any Power
that had been given to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch
of the Weſt, was reckoned to extend to
the whole Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>But the laſt and great Step to theſe and all other
Papal Uſurpations was, the great Lands and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues
which were beſtowed on the Roman See,
upon the Fall of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the
Great, and other Princes; which great Riches,
with the aſſiſtance of pious Frauds, chiefly of
that Madneſs the Popes and their Monks inſpired
Princes with, who ſtood in the way of their Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of going as far as the Holy Land to deſtroy
themſelves; theſe, I ſay, enabled that Prelat to lay
both Church and Empire at his Feet, the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks,
if they had been willing, not being able
to cope with a Power which at one time or other
had trampled on moſt of the great Crowns of
<hi>Europe:</hi> all which was to come to paſs, that the
Scriptures might be fulfilled, which ſpeaking of
the Antichriſt that was to come, ſay, that after
<hi>that which withheld,</hi> that is, the Roman Empire,
was taken out of the way, he was <hi>to ſit in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, as God;</hi> that is, he was to oppreſs the
Church as a Monarch or Tyrant, and was ſo to
bewitch the Kings of the Earth by his <hi>Sorceries,</hi>
and the World by his <hi>lying Signs and Wonders,</hi> as
to be in a Condition to deſtroy all that would not
take his <hi>Mark</hi> upon them, by ſubmitting their
Souls and Bodies to his Tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57465:7"/>
But to return to the Popes Uſurpations upon
General Councils.</p>
            <p>The firſt Council called by any Pope, that had the
Title of General given it by the Roman Canoniſts
themſelves, was that of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> convocated in
the Year 1123, by <hi>Calixtus</hi> the ſecond, againſt the
<hi>Saracens;</hi> of which Synod, tho neither the Letters
Convocatory, nor the Acts are extant, that we
know of, nevertheleſs there is no doubt to be
made of its having been both called, and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
governed by the Pope: but it is not ſo clear
how or when it came to be firſt ſtiled a General
Council, for it does not appear that it ever look'd
upon it ſelf as ſuch, unleſs it was that the late
Canoniſts would right or wrong ſtile it ſo, to
have as early a Precedent as might be for the Pope's
having an Abſolute Authority over ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.
The ſame is applicable to the ſecond and
third <hi>Lateran</hi> Synods, none of which can be called
General Councils, but by the ſame <hi>Bull</hi> that the
Roman is called the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>The fourth <hi>Lateran</hi> Synod, convocated by <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>
the Third, in the Year 1215, againſt the
<hi>Waldenſes,</hi> was call'd, it's true, as a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
<hi>Innocent</hi> having in his Letters Convocatory
commanded all the Biſhops of the Eaſt and Weſt
to repair to it: but when it met, tho very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
there was no Aſſembly that it was leſs like
than a General Council; for beſides that it was
in a manner made up of <hi>Italians,</hi> the Abbots and
Priors that ſat and had Votes in it, were above
double the number of the Biſhops, who being all
jumbled together had not one grain of Authority
among them. The firſt Council of <hi>Lions,</hi> called by
<hi>Innocent</hi> the Fourth, in the Year 1245, againſt
<hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperor, and the ſecond of the ſame
place, call'd by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Tenth, in the Year 1274,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57465:7"/>
and the Council of <hi>Vien</hi> called by <hi>Clement</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi>
in the Year 1311, which are all reckoned by the
Roman Canoniſts to have been General Councils,
were all but motley Aſſemblies of Biſhops, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
and Abbots, without any thing of Authority,
being called for no other end but to give ſome
Countenance to ſuch things as the Popes had a
mind to have done.</p>
            <p>But the Latin Church, tho it was for ſome Ages
under this Bondage, had not it ſeems ſo far loſt
all ſenſe of Liberty, as not to ſtrive, when it had
an Opportunity put into its Hands, to recover
it again. The Story of the Struggle betwixt the
Popes and Councils, which laſted ſeveral Years,
as it is a thing not improper to my purpoſe, ſo I
hope it will not be ungrateful to the Reader, who
therein on the Popes Side, will meet with ſuch a
train of Falſhood and Diſſimulations, as is not,
that I know of, to be met with any where elſe in
Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>11th,</hi> who had brought back the
Papal Court from <hi>Avignion,</hi> where it had been 70
Years, to <hi>Rome</hi> again, dying in the Year 1378,
the Nobles and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> knowing the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority
of the Cardinals at that time to be <hi>French,</hi>
and fearing that if they ſhould chuſe a Pope of
their own Nation, he might go back to <hi>Avignion,</hi>
did by force of Arms oblige all the Cardinals, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came to an Election, to take an Oath to
chuſe a Pope who was a <hi>Roman,</hi> or at leaſt an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian:</hi>
Which the Cardinals having taken, they
choſe <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bar,</hi> who was
by birth a <hi>Neopolitan,</hi> but had lived moſt of his
time in <hi>France,</hi> and who took the Name of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinals, at leaſt the major part of them,
as ſoon as they were at liberty, leaving <hi>Rome,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
firſt to <hi>Anagnia,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Fundi;</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57465:8"/>
from whence they writ to <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> conjuring
him by all that was Sacred, ſince he could not but
be ſenſible that his Election, being a forced Act,
was null, not to pretend to be Pope. But <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew</hi>
was not to be perſwaded out of the Papal
Chair now he was in it, which way ſoever he got
into it. The Cardinals proceeded to a new Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at <hi>Fundi,</hi> and choſe <hi>Robert</hi> Brother to the Earl
of <hi>Savennes,</hi> and Cardinal Presbyter of the 12
Apoſtles, Pope, who took the Name of <hi>Clement.</hi>
Which two Popes, inſiſting on their ſeveral Rights,
and not without great ſhew of Reaſon, both of
them having had their Titles to the Papacy made
good by innumerable and undeniable Miracles
wrought by the Saints under their ſeveral Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
they thereby begun a Schiſm which laſted at
leaſt 40 Years; and which in the End gave the
Weſtern Church an opportunity to recover her
Liberty in a great meaſure again, tho when ſhe
had it ſhe was not able to keep it long.</p>
            <p>For the Chriſtian Princes, who were near equally
divided betwixt the two Popes, growing weary of
the Quarrels of ſo long a Schiſm, did all agree to
have a Council aſſembled at <hi>Piſa</hi> to find out ſome
way to put an end to it. That Council conſiſted
of a great number of Cardinals and Biſhops; and
there were preſent in it the Embaſſadors of the
King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of <hi>England, France, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Jeruſalem, Sicily, Cyprus,</hi> and divers other
Princes. They being aſſembled in the Year 1409,
after having ſummoned both the Popes, who were
at that time <hi>Angelus Corarius</hi> called <hi>Gregory</hi> the
<hi>12th,</hi> and <hi>Peter de Luna</hi> called <hi>Benedict</hi> the <hi>14th,</hi>
depoſed them both upon their not appearing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Perſon, nor by their Procurators, as <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible
Schiſmaticks, Hereticks,</hi> and as guilty of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion</hi>
and <hi>Perjury,</hi> each of them having ſworn to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57465:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reſign the Papacy when the other ſhould do it.
They having thus declared the Roman See vacant,
obliged every Cardinal, before they would give
way to their filling of it again, to give it under
his Hand, that in caſe he ſhould be choſen Pope,
he ſhould not diſſolve the Council, until the
Church was <hi>reformed</hi> both in its <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Members;</hi>
making a Decree likewiſe, that in caſe any Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
that was then abſent ſhould be choſen by
them, his Election ſhould not be publiſhed until he
had given the Synod the ſame Security. After
which the Cardinals, who were 24 in number, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to an Election, and choſe <hi>Peter Philargi</hi> a
Greek, the Cardinal of the 12 Apoſtles, and who
had ſtudied Philoſophy at <hi>Oxford,</hi> who took the
Name of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> After whoſe Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
the Council paſſed a Decree, that another
General Synod ſhould meet in the Year 1412, in
ſome City to be named a Year before, and that in
the mean time Provincial Councils ſhould be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in all Countries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> dying in ten Months after he
was choſen, was ſucceeded by Cardinal <hi>Taſſa</hi> an
<hi>Italian,</hi> who took the Name of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>23d,</hi> and
who, when two Years were expired, did, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Council of <hi>Piſa,</hi> call a Synod at
<hi>Rome;</hi> which, upon a pretence that there was not
a ſufficient Number of Prelats for the celebrating
of a General Council, he diſſolved preſently after
it met.</p>
            <p>But the Council of <hi>Piſa</hi> having, inſtead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing,
increaſed the <hi>Schiſm,</hi> by adding a
third Pope to the two that were before, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Princes, after having obliged every one of the
Three to take an Oath to reſign their Claim to
the Papacy whenever the other two did it, forced
<hi>John</hi> the <hi>23d,</hi> who was owned as Pope by moſt of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57465:9"/>
them, to call a Council to meet at <hi>Conſtance</hi> in
the Year 1415, and to promiſe to aſſiſt at it in
Perſon: Which Council being met at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and having preſently diſcovered that
<hi>John,</hi> notwithſtanding all his Promiſes and Oaths
to the contrary, was at that time caballing with
Princes to maintain him in the Papacy; the firſt
thing it did, was to require <hi>John</hi> immediately to
bind himſelf by Bulls, to obſerve the following
Orders. 1. That the preſent Synod ſhould not be
diſſolved, until the Union was perfected. 2. That
it ſhould not be removed from <hi>Conſtance.</hi> 3. That
he himſelf ſhould not depart from thence till it
was done. 4. That he ſhould conſtitute a Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,
with full Powers to reſign the Papacy in his
Name. And, laſtly, That it ſhould not be lawful
for any Prelat to leave the Council, or not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to it, but in caſe of Poverty or Sickneſs. To
which Demands <hi>John,</hi> the next Day after they were
made, returned the following Anſwers. 1. That
the Council ſhould not be diſſolved until it had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
the Union. 2. That it was nevertheleſs his
Opinion, that it would be convenient to have it
tranſlated to <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> and for him to go
thither to it in Perſon. And, laſtly, That he was
reſolved to make his Ceſſion in Perſon, which he
reckoned would be more honourable both for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and the Synod, than to do it by Proxy. But
the Fathers not being ſatisfy'd with this ſhuffling
Anſwer, and inſiſting upon having his Ceſſion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
under his Hand, he promiſed them
faithfully that they ſhould have it next Morning;
but before that came, he ſtole out of <hi>Conſtance</hi> by
Night in a Woman's Apparel, and was got to
<hi>Schafhouſen,</hi> a Town then belonging to the Duke of
<hi>Auſtria,</hi> (now one of the Cantons) who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to protect him if he were once in his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57465:9"/>
From which Place he immediately wrote
to the Council, to aſſure them that the Reaſon of
his having retired from <hi>Conſtance,</hi> was not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the being obliged to make a Ceſſion, but on
the contrary, that he might do it with the more
Liberty and Security, which he reckoned he might
do at <hi>Schafhouſen</hi> where he now was. But his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and all the other Princes
under his Obedience, tho writ at the ſame time,
were in a quite contrary Strain, in which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to juſtify his having left the Council,
becauſe he and it were both robbed of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
his Life having been likewiſe in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
by a Conſpiracy which he had diſcovered;
complaining likewiſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi>
who had ſaid publickly, and in the Emperor's
hearing, that the Emperor was ſuperior both to
him and the Council, none daring to reprove him
for ſuch ſcandalous Doctrine.</p>
            <p>The Council, when it came to hear next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>John</hi> had given them the ſlip, was in great
diſorder, and continued under a great Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
till the Emperor came amongſt them, and
aſſured them that he would protect them againſt
the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and all the Enemies <hi>John</hi> was
able to raiſe up againſt them: The Fathers were
likewiſe much confirmed by a Sermon preached to
them at that time by the Learned <hi>John Gerſon</hi>
Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
to them, that being a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
they were ſuperior to the Pope, and might ſit
and act without him.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>John,</hi> who had too many Spies in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
not to be acquainted with every Word that
was ſaid in it, reckoning he was too near the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi>
at <hi>Schafhouſen,</hi> which is but four Leagues from
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> removed from thence to the Caſtle of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57465:10"/>
               <hi>Loufemberg;</hi> which tho he did in great haſte, yet
before he begun his Journey, he declared, by a
Publick Inſtrument, that he was under no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to obſerve the Oaths and Promiſes he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and made at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> having been forced
to take and make them, by a Fear that was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to make any Act that it cauſed to be invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,
pretending to juſtify his having left <hi>Schaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſen,</hi>
by having diſcovered that he was there in
danger of his Life, which he was willing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;
becauſe ſhould he be murdered before the
two Pretenders to the Papacy had made their Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
they in all probability would never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to it.</p>
            <p>When <hi>John</hi> left <hi>Schafhouſen,</hi> the Cardinals who
had been ſent thither by the Council to perſwade
him to come back, returned to <hi>Conſtance;</hi> and ſix
of them at the following Seſſion, declared therein,
that the Council now the Pope had left it, was
diſſolved. Which bold Declaration gave occaſion
to the Fathers to lay the Ax to the Root of the
Tree, all of them, but particularly the Cardinal
<hi>Peter de Aliaco</hi> and <hi>John Gerſon,</hi> maintaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
That the Pope being inferior to a General
Council, which the preſent Synod was, he could
not diſſolve it without its own Conſent; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
in the next Seſſion, at which, with the
Emperor, there aſſiſted nine Cardinals and two
hundred Fathers, the Embaſſadors of the Kings of
<hi>England, France, Poland, Norway, Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var,</hi>

Briars of Hereſy, Errors and Schiſms, and for
the reforming of Abuſes and Exceſſes, to the
rendring of the Lord's Vineyard fruitful, the
long intermiſſion of them diſſeminating and
nouriſhing all the foreſaid Evils; all which both
the Memory of Times paſt, and the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the preſent State of Affairs, do plainly
ſet before our Eyes: For which Cauſe, we do by
this perpetual Edict eſtabliſh, decree, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
That General Councils be frequently held,
and that the firſt do meet at the end of five
Years after the diſſolution of this, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
at the end of ſeven Years after that: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which a General Council ſhall be perpetually
held, from ten Years to ten Years, in ſuch Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as the Pope ſhall, a Month before the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of every Council, but with the Conſent
and Approbation of the ſaid Council, appoint;
and in caſe the Pope ſhould deny to do it, the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57465:12"/>
Council is then bound to appoint it, that ſo
by a certain Continuation, a Council may be
always either ſitting, or in view within a
certain Term of Years; which Term it ſhall
be lawful for the Pope to ſhorten, if there
ſhould be occaſion for it, with the Advice of
his Brethren the Cardinals, but on no Account to
prolong it: Neither ſhall it be lawful for him,
except in a caſe of viſible Neceſſity, as of a
Siege, War, Peſtilence, and the like, to change
the Place that has been appointed; and when
he does it in ſuch a caſe, it ſhall be with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of his Brethren the Cardinals, or of two
thirds of them; and he ſhall then aſſign ſome
other Place, as near as may be with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the Place that was firſt appointed, and
in the ſame Nation, in caſe the ſame Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
do not extend to all the Parts thereof;
which if they ſhould happen to do, it ſhall then
be called in the next Country to it; to which
Place all Prelats and others, who do uſe to be
called to Councils, are bound to repair, as if
it had been the Place at firſt appointed: Which
change of Place, and abbreviation of Time, the
Pope is bound legally and ſolemnly to publiſh,
and intimate a Year before the expiration of
the Time that was firſt fixt, that ſo the Prelats
may all at the Time appointed repair to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of a Council.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A certain Prelat, whoſe Name I have not been
able to recover, foreſeeing, it is like, that this
wholſome Conſtitution would in a ſhort time come
to nothing, by the Power that was given to the Pope
to change the Place that had been fixt when there
was a Neceſſity of it, of which Neceſſity he was the
Judg, propoſed ſome Heads to the Synod, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57465:12"/>
had they been agreed to, and executed, would ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
have ſecured the Church from a Relapſe.</p>
            <p>The firſt was, That neither the Pope nor his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
ſhould be allowed to ſit in a Council whoſe
chief Buſineſs was to reform them, it not being fit
that any Man ſhould be Judg in his own Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was, That the Cardinals who had
choſen <hi>John,</hi> knowing him to be a moſt flagitious
Perſon, ought to be ſeverely puniſhed for it, and
not be permitted to ſit in the Council.</p>
            <p>The third was, That the Cardinals who had of
their own accord followed <hi>John,</hi> when he ſtole out of
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> ought to be expelled the Council, as they
ought alſo to be who had affirmed the Synod to be
diſſolved upon <hi>John</hi>'s having run away from it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, That till the Power of the Pope and his
Miniſters was ſuſpended and retrenched, it was a
vain thing to think of reforming the Church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in its <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Members.</hi> I will not ſay that
theſe Propoſals were <hi>John Gerſon</hi>'s, tho they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
in the main with what we meet with in his
Treatiſes writ on this Occaſion; but I think one
may venture to ſay, they were things not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
either of his great Piety or Learning.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>John,</hi> who was for leaving no Stone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
to keep in that beloved Chair which he
had ſo often ſworn to reſign, underſtanding that
his preſent Protector, the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> was
about ſubmitting himſelf to the Emperor, one of
the Articles whereof he knew would be, That he
ſhould deliver him into the Hands of the Council,
endeavoured by large Promiſes to engage the Duke
of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in his Quarrel; with whom, that he
might treat with the more privacy and ſecurity,
he ſtole away, with two Servants only, to <hi>Friburgh;</hi>
and from thence he removed to <hi>Briſac,</hi> at which
Place the Nuncios who were ſent after him by the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57465:13"/>
Council, with Powers to require him to ſign a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curation,
in a Form preſcribed by the Synod, to
reſign the Papacy, overtook him; who having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that of him, he promiſed that they ſhould
have his Anſwer next Morning: But before that
came he was gone, having ſtoln out of <hi>Briſac</hi> in
the Night; and the next news the Nuncios heard
of him was, that he had been at <hi>Newburgh,</hi> but had
been frighted out of that City by a falſe Report
he had met with there, of the Emperor's advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
that way with an Army, and that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Friburgh</hi> again; at which City the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cios
having gone after him, prevailed with him to
ſign the foreſaid Procuration, but it was clogg'd
by him with ſuch Conditions, as he knew very well
the Council would never agree to: Neither was
he miſtaken, the Council, when that Inſtrument was
preſented to them by the Nuncios, rejecting it
with Indignation as an Affront to their Wiſdom;
and being grown weary of treating any longer
with ſuch a falſe ſhuffling Man, gave order to have
him proceeded againſt judicially, knowing very
well there would be Crimes proved upon him, for
which, were there no ſuch thing as Schiſm, he would
deſerve to be depoſed; Simony, Perjury, and a moſt
flagitious courſe of Life having been proved againſt
him, by Witneſſes againſt whoſe Teſtimonies there
could be no Exception. He was accuſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of having poiſoned his Predeceſſor, and of
having many times in Diſcourſe diſcovered, that
he did not believe the Immortality of the Soul.
After which the Council, tho fully ſatisfied of his
Guilt, yet that it might not be ſaid of them that
they had condemned a Man for enormous Crimes,
without having firſt heard what he had to ſay in his
own Defence, ordered his Proceſs to be carried to
him by five Prelats, to ſee what he had to object
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57465:13"/>
againſt it; who having waited upon him with it at
<hi>Zell,</hi> found him very humble and tractable: he told
them he was ſo ſorry for his having ſtole away
from the Council as he did, that if it had been
God's Will, he wiſh'd that his Death had preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his having done it; and that as he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to object to the Articles proved againſt him
in his Proceſs, ſo he was prepared to ſubmit to the
Sentence of the Synod thereon with a moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Humility, deſiring nothing ſo much as that
they would pronounce it ſpeedily upon him: in
which the Synod willingly gratified him, having
ſo ſoon as it had his Anſwer, paſſed a Definitive
Sentence, declaring him to be no longer Pope, and
prohibiting all Chriſtians any longer to own him
as ſuch, or to give him the Title thereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
to themſelves a Power of inflicting ſuch
other Puniſhments upon him as the Crimes he had
been proved guilty of deſerved; making a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
at the ſame time, That in caſe the Roman
See ſhould any ways come to be vacant, that the
Cardinals ſhould not proceed to the Election of a
Pope, without the Conſent of the Council; and
that neither <hi>Baltaſar de Coſſa,</hi> lately <hi>John</hi> the <hi>23d,</hi>
nor <hi>Angelus de Corario,</hi> called <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>12th,</hi>
nor <hi>Peter de Luna,</hi> called <hi>Benedict</hi> the <hi>14th,</hi> ſhould
ever be choſe Pope, or if they were, their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhould be void. Which Sentence and Decree
being carried to <hi>Baltaſar de Coſſa</hi> at <hi>Zell,</hi> he gave
his Conſent to them by a publick Inſtrument,
taking an Oath never to do any thing to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travention
thereof.</p>
            <p>The Council having thus laid <hi>John,</hi> who was the
Pope they owned, aſide; its next buſineſs was to
oblige the other two Pretenders to quit their
Claims. As to <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>12th,</hi> who was owned
only by a ſmall part of <hi>Italy,</hi> after a great many
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57465:14"/>
Doublings he was prevailed with to appoint a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator
to reſign the Papacy in his Name; but
not to the Council, which having been called by
<hi>John,</hi> he would not acknowledg, but to the King
of the <hi>Romans:</hi> to which he was in good hopes the
Council would never have agreed; but he was
diſappointed, his Reſignation by his Procurator
<hi>Charles Malateſti</hi> being accepted; at which <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
is ſaid to have been ſo angry, as, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he had a large and honourable Maintenance
allowed him, to have died quickly after of pure
Vexation within himſelf, for having put ſuch a
Power out of his own Hands into the Hand of a
Procurator.</p>
            <p>But for <hi>Benedict</hi> the <hi>13th,</hi> notwithſtanding that
<hi>Sigiſmund</hi> went into <hi>Spain</hi> on purpoſe to perſwade
him to reſign, and was ſeconded therein by the
King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> in whoſe Country he kept his
Court, he would not promiſe to quit his Claim,
but upon ſuch Conditions as he was certain would
never be granted him; and upon the King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon</hi>'s
withdrawing his Obedience from him, he
retired to a <hi>Peninſula</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Valentia,</hi>
called antiently the <hi>Cherſoneſus,</hi> but at this time
<hi>Rocha da Truna,</hi> where he lived ſeveral Years after
he was declared by the Council not to be Pope,
without ever reſigning his Title to it but with his
laſt Breath.</p>
            <p>The Council being informed by <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> when
he returned from <hi>Spain,</hi> that <hi>Benedict</hi> was not to
be perſwaded to reſign, did thereupon name a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Number of Prelats to judg his Cauſe; and
having ſummoned him to appear before them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Perſon, or by his Proxy, in a hundred days,
they ſent two Monks of <hi>Cluny</hi> to acquaint him
with his being ſummoned, and to try whether
now that he was thrown off almoſt by every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57465:14"/>
they could perſwade him for the Peace of the
Church to reſign: when <hi>Benedict</hi> firſt ſaw the
Monks coming towards him, he ſaid aloud to his
Courtiers, <hi>Come, let us hear what theſe two Synodal
Ravens have to ſay to us;</hi> to which one of the
Monks return'd this lively Repartee, That it was
no wonder if Ravens did come to a Carcaſe that
was thrown out.</p>
            <p>The Monks being returned to <hi>Conſtance</hi> without
having been able to do any thing, and the hundred
days being expired, the Synod declared the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
See to be vacant; and having given Order to
have it filled again, they joined a Majority of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Biſhops and Prelats to the Cardinals in the
Election, making a Decree at the ſame time, that
the new Pope ſhould not diſſolve the Council until
the Church was <hi>reformed</hi> both in its <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:</hi>
in purſuance whereof the Cardinals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prelats having on the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>November 1417.</hi>
entred the Conclave, on the third day after they
were ſhut up they choſe <hi>Odo de Columna</hi> Cardinal
Deacon of St. <hi>George,</hi> to the great Satisfaction of
<hi>Sigiſmund</hi> and the whole Council, who looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him as a devout ſimple Man, did not doubt now
that he was Pope, of his complying with what he
had promoted ſo much when he was Cardinal.
But the Synod quickly found it ſelf miſtaken; for
notwithſtanding <hi>Martin,</hi> which was the Name he
took, comply'd ſo far with it, as to appoint <hi>Pavia</hi>
to be the City the Council at the end of five Years
was to meet at; nevertheleſs when he was ſpoke
to by ſeveral of the Prelats, that they might go
on with the Reformation of the Church in its
<hi>Head and Members,</hi> he told them very gravely;
that that was not a time for ſo good a Work;
of which Anſwer when the French Prelats com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
to their King, deſiring him to oblige <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57465:15"/>
to keep his Promiſe to them, in joining with
the Synod to reform the Church; the King ſent
them word, that if they had deſigned to have had
the Church reformed, they ought to have done it
before they choſe a Pope, ſince they might very
well have known that when that was once done, it
would be neither in his Power nor theirs to do it,
as it was in the time of the Vacancy. The Synod's
new Pope is ſaid furthermore to have given it a
broad Intimation before he diſſolved it, how he
ſtood affected to their Decrees, telling them on a
certain occaſion, and that of his own giving too,
that he intended to obſerve every thing that had
been <hi>conciliarily</hi> decreed by them, leaving it to
them to judg whether what they had decreed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
a General Council's being ſuperiour to
the Pope was reckoned by him among their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliary</hi>
Acts.</p>
            <p>We are not told how the Council reſented this
early Diſtinction from their own Creature, if it
was ever made by him, there being no mention of
it in the Acts of the Council; but however that
were, it is certain, that from the hour of his
Election he intended nothing leſs than to go on
with Councils on the Bottom whereon they had
placed them: Nevertheleſs while <hi>Peter de Luna</hi>
lived, which he did ſeveral Years after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Conſtance</hi> was diſſolved, he was obliged in
Intereſt not to run down the Authority of an
Aſſembly, on whoſe Authority his own abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depended: So at the end of four Years after
the Diſſolution of the Synod of <hi>Conſtance, Peter
de Luna</hi> being ſtill alive, he comply'd with the
Decree of aſſembling a General Council at <hi>Pavia,</hi>
giving Intimation thereof to all Chriſtian Prelats,
but in ſuch a manner, that they had no reaſon to
think he would be angry with them if they did
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57465:15"/>
not repair to it. Which Council after he had
opened it by four obſcure Legats, he tranſlated
preſently to <hi>Siena,</hi> upon a pretence that the Plague
was in <hi>Pavia,</hi> that being one of the Reaſons for
which the Decree of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had allowed him
to change the appointed place of a Synod: But
the Legats not having been long at <hi>Siena</hi> before
they found themſelves in a full Aſſembly of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and hearing of more that were coming to
them, <hi>Martin</hi> to chaſtiſe their Forwardneſs, and to
prejudice the World againſt Councils, as if the
Plague had followed them whereſoever they went,
diſſolved the Council of a ſudden upon the ſame
pretence on which he had tranſlated it thither
from <hi>Pavia;</hi> which Pretence the Hiſtory of the
City of <hi>Siena</hi> tells us was a meer Falſhood, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like the Plague having been at <hi>Siena</hi> at that
time. But <hi>Peter de Luna</hi> being not only alive, but
having engaged the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> upon a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
that was between him and <hi>Martin,</hi> to ſend
Embaſſadors to <hi>Siena</hi> to maintain his Title to the
Papacy, <hi>Martin</hi> was thereby obliged to go on,
ſhewing ſome Reſpect to the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
and ſo did in Obedience to its Decree, at the ſame
time he diſſolved the Synod of <hi>Siena,</hi> call a
Council to meet at the end of ſeven Years at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil;</hi>
by which time, conſidering <hi>Peter</hi>'s great Age,
he did not much doubt but that he would be in his
Grave; which Council, tho <hi>Martin</hi> lived to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
and to ſend a Legat to it, he died juſt
before the time it was to have met.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth, who ſucceeded <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
finding a Council called to ſit at <hi>Baſil</hi> by his
Predeceſſor, renewed the Convocation thereof;
and to encourage the Prelats to come to it, he
named only the Year, but not the Day nor the
Month whereon it was to meet, conſtituting Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57465:16"/>
               <hi>Julianus,</hi> who was at that time at the Head
of an Army in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> his Legat to preſide
therein. Which juggling of the Pope's having
been obſerved by one <hi>Alexander</hi> a Monk, whoſe
Name was high in the Church both for his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Piety, he in order to defeat <hi>Eugenius,</hi>
who having given the World ſome Satisfaction in
calling the Council, was for letting the Year ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for its ſitting both by the Synod of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
and his Predeceſſor, ſlip over quietly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to <hi>Baſil;</hi> and having called together all
the Eccleſiaſticks that were within and about the
City, he declared to them, that the time being
now come for the celebrating of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
in Conformity to the Decrees of the Synods
of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Siena,</hi> in their City, to which
Synod all that have a right to vote in ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
were bound to reſort, he reckoned he was
obliged in Conſcience to come and make a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Declaration thereof upon the Place, that ſo
it might be none of his fault if it were not aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
as it ought to be, both to maintain the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Church, and to <hi>reform</hi> it in its <hi>Head</hi>
and <hi>Members.</hi> But <hi>Eugenius</hi> having taken no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of what was done by a private Monk in a fit of
Zeal, the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> which, to give that
Great and Learned Body its due, was in thoſe days
the only ſtanding Authority that on all occaſions
aſſerted the Liberty of the Church, that the Pope
might not diſſolve the Council upon a pretence of
no Eccleſiaſticks having repaired to it when it was
called by him, diſpatched ſome of its learned
Members to <hi>Baſil</hi> to promote its aſſembling, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at the ſame time to <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of the
Romans, and moſt of the other Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
to ſend their Embaſſadors and Prelats thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57465:16"/>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> being alarm'd by ſo great a Body's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing
its Authority in the Buſineſs, writ to his
Legat <hi>Julianus,</hi> ſo ſoon as he had finiſh'd his work
in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to repair to <hi>Baſil</hi> in Perſon, and in the
mean time to delegate ſome Eccleſiaſticks to go
thither, and open a Council to thoſe that were ſo
clamorous to have one; and accordingly <hi>Julianus</hi>
named <hi>John Palmar,</hi> an Auditor of the Sacred
Palace, and <hi>John de Raguſio</hi> the Procurator Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the Dominicans, to go and begin the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
at <hi>Baſil,</hi> which they did in the Chapter-houſe
of the Cathedral on the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
entring upon any Buſineſs of moment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julianus,</hi> who expected the poor <hi>Huſſites</hi> would
not have been a Breakfaſt to his great and zealous
<hi>Croiſado,</hi> after having deſtroy'd a few open Towns
belonging to them, was deſerted by his whole
Army, who, as if a pannick Fear had ſeized them,
diſperſed all of a ſudden, without having ever
ſeen the face of the People they had been raiſed
by Indulgences to extirpate, leaving their whole
Baggage, which was very rich, behind them to the
<hi>Huſſites,</hi> who drove <hi>Julianus</hi> to <hi>Baſil</hi> to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was able to manage a Council againſt
them with better Succeſs than he had done an
Army: But <hi>Julianus</hi> had not been many days in
that City, to which great numbers of Eccleſiaſticks
and others had flock'd, before he received Orders
from <hi>Eugenius</hi> to diſſolve the Council, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
to the Prelats that he deſigned to call a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
in a ſhort time at <hi>Bononia,</hi> at which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to aſſiſt in Perſon, alledging the following
Reaſons for diſſolving of that of <hi>Baſil.</hi> 1. That
there was not a ſufficient Number of Prelats at
<hi>Baſil</hi> to celebrate a General Council. 2. That
that City was infeſted with the Hereſy of the
<hi>Huſſites.</hi> 3. That the Princes in its Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57465:17"/>
were in War one with another. And laſtly,
that the Greeks, who at preſent ſeemed well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to ſubmit themſelves to him, were rather
for having the Council at <hi>Bononia</hi> than at <hi>Baſil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julianus,</hi> when he firſt received theſe Orders,
notwithſtanding he knew the Pope's Reaſons for
diſſolving the Council to be all falſe, ſeemed incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to have obeyed them, having forborn for
ſome days after to act as <hi>Preſident:</hi> But having
obſerved that the Princes and Prelats that were at
<hi>Baſil</hi> were all reſolved, notwithſtanding the Pope
ſhould pretend to diſſolve it, to go on with the
Council, and that the Cardinals who were fled
thither from <hi>Rome,</hi> would all join with them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
he did not only reſume his Preſidentſhip again,
but was ſo far from executing the Pope's Orders,
that he ſeem'd to go intirely into the Intereſts of
the Council againſt him; and having accordingly
ſummoned all the Embaſſadors, Cardinals and
Prelats that were at <hi>Baſil,</hi> to aſſemble on the <hi>7th</hi>
of <hi>December</hi> in St. <hi>Leonard</hi>'s Church, it was there
agreed that the firſt Seſſion of the Synod ſhould be
celebrated in the Cathedral Church on the <hi>14th</hi>
day of the Month current; of which having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
an Inſtrument to be drawn up, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it to be affixed to the Gates of all the
Churches in the City.</p>
            <p>The day of the Seſſion being come, and all the
Cardinals, Embaſſadors and Prelats being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in the Cathedral, <hi>Julianus</hi> after Maſs made
a long and learned Speech to them; which being
ended, the Biſhop of <hi>Coutances</hi> aſcended the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
and with an audible Voice read the Decree of
the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> concerning the frequent
Celebration of Councils, as alſo the Inſtrument
of the Nomination of the City of <hi>Baſil,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with Pope <hi>Martin,</hi> and Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57465:17"/>
of Convocation; after that they made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Orders about freedom of Speech, and againſt
ſuch as ſhould hinder any Perſons from coming
to <hi>Baſil,</hi> ordering likewiſe that the Prelats who
aſſiſted at the Council ſhould enjoy the full Profits
of their Benefices, and naming the Notaries and
other Officers of the Synod.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who could not brook to have his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
thus affronted, thunders out from <hi>Rome</hi> a
Bull of Diſſolution of the Council, in which, beſides
his former fantaſtical Reaſons, he added that of the
Synod's having invited the <hi>Huſſites,</hi> who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> to come and treat with them: He
alſo called a Synod at the ſame time to meet at the
end of 18 Months at <hi>Bononia;</hi> and another ten
Years after that was diſſolved, at <hi>Avignon,</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
it ſeems to ſupererogate in giving the Church
two Councils at the diſtance of ſome time, and
which were to be celebrated in Cities under his
temporal Juriſdiction, for one that was in being and
out of his Territories, upon the Bottom of the
Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> whoſe Eſtabliſhment he
reckoned would be broke by his having called new
Councils to meet, as he had now done. But <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi>
after he had given this bold Stroke, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
left <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> whom he knew to be a great
Friend to Councils, and who had his Embaſſadors
at <hi>Baſil,</hi> might be diſpleaſed with him for what
he had done, writ Letters to him of the ſame
Date with the Bull of Diſſolution, to ſatisfy him
of the Neceſſity there was of calling a Council at
<hi>Bononia</hi> for the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who ſeemed to be diſpoſed
to ſubmit themſelves to the <hi>Roman Chair.</hi> To
which <hi>Banter,</hi> for it was no better, <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
a ſevere Anſwer, bearing date the <hi>9th</hi> of
<hi>January,</hi> telling <hi>Eugenius</hi> in plain Terms, That the
Reaſons he had given for his having diſſolved the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57465:18"/>
Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> were all fantaſtical, it being a
Jeſt to put off the doing of ſo neceſſary a Work
as the Reformation of the Church, upon a Surmiſe
of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who had for ſome hundreds of Years
been Schiſmaticks, appearing to be inclinable to
unite themſelves to the Roman See; deſiring him
alſo to conſider what would in all probability be
the Conſequence of what he had done, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
at <hi>Baſil</hi> being reſolved, notwithſtanding his
Diſſolution, to ſit and act as a Council, and in ſo
doing would be protected by all or moſt of the
Princes of <hi>Europe;</hi> concluding his Letter with this
vehement Exhortation, <q>We do moſt earneſtly
beſeech and require your Holineſs, in our Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe Buſineſs this is, that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how what you have done, may tend to the
Subverſion of the Chriſtian Religion, you would
immediately remedy it, by writing to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
and Council, that they may proceed in
the Name of the Holy Ghoſt, in which they
were called, to finiſh the Work they have in
hand.</q> Neither was <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> miſtaken in
treating what <hi>Eugenius</hi> alledged concerning an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as a thing given out only for
a Colour; <hi>Eugenius</hi> having, after he had made this
uſe of it, ſlighted the Buſineſs of that Union,
when the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperor's Embaſſadors came from
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> on purpoſe to treat with him about
it; which he did to that degree, after it had been
ſo far advanced by his Predeceſſor, as to put an
end to it. It is true, that Treaty was afterwards
revived by him, and that with great Zeal; but
when we come to that, we ſhall ſee what was the
Reaſon of it. <hi>Eugenius</hi> was writ to likewiſe by
the Kings of <hi>England, France,</hi> &amp;c. who upon the
Synod's Nuncios coming to their Courts, had all
declared themſelves in its Favour, to revoke his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57465:18"/>
pretended Diſſolution of it, that ſo he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
a Schiſm. And the <hi>French</hi> Clergy having
been called by their King at <hi>Bourgis</hi> for their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in this Matter, did unanimouſly declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on the ſide of the Council, deſiring his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to eſpouſe its Quarrel, as the common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
of the Univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>The Preſident <hi>Julianus</hi> writ likewiſe paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his Maſter, to revoke his Bull that was ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
odious; telling him in plain Terms, that
if he did not do it, and that ſpeedily too, he would
raiſe ſuch a Schiſm in the Church as had never been
ſeen in it before; concluding his Letter to him
thus, <q>I have called upon Men on this Occaſion,
till I am hoarſe; I will therefore now call upon
Chriſt, and beg him to look with an Eye of Pity
on his forſaken Church, which he purchaſed
with his own Blood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Synod likewiſe, which was not willing, if
it could have helpt it, to have broke with <hi>Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
diſpatched Nuncios to him, to intreat him to
revoke the ſaid Bull, and to come to them in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or by his Legats, to aſſiſt at the Reformation
of the Church. To all which Remonſtrances <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi>
turned a deaf Ear, ſeeming reſolved to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
all, rather than ſuffer Councils to go on on
the Foot of that of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> which, tho he never
mentioned it, was the true Ground of his Quarrel
with the <hi>Baſileans;</hi> and they being ſenſible that it
was ſo, now that they had ſo many Friends abroad,
did ſet about eſtabliſhing their own Authority, by
paſſing the following Decrees.</p>
            <p>
               <q>1. That the Sacred Synod of <hi>Baſil,</hi> in having
been aſſembled according to the Decrees of the
Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Siena,</hi> and with the
Concurrence of the Pope, was a lawful Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:57465:19"/>
               <q>2. That being a lawful General Council, all
Chriſtians of whatſoever State or Dignity, the
Papal not excepted, were bound to yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to it in all Matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> the Extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of Schiſm, and the general <hi>Reformation</hi>
of the Church in its <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Members.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>3. That whoſoever, of whatſoever State or
Dignity, the Papal not excepted, ſhould deny
to yield Obedience to the Statutes of any Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council, relating to any of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Matters, deſerve to be puniſhed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>4. That it ſhould not be lawful for any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Council to abſent himſelf from it, or
to depart from the City of <hi>Baſil</hi> without leave
of the Council.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>From which Decrees they inferred, That the
Papal, nor no other Authority on Earth had
Power to prorogue, tranſlate or diſſolve the
General Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> without its own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
or to hinder any Prelats from repairing
to it, or to oblige any that aſſiſted at it to
withdraw.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In virtue whereof they admoniſhed <hi>Eugenius,</hi>
within the ſpace of three Months, by a publick
Bull, to revoke his pretended Diſſolution of them,
and to come in Perſon to the Council; or, being
lawfully hindred, by his Legats; in default whereof
they threatned to proceed againſt him, as the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt ſhould direct them for the Good of the
Church.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Julianus</hi> perceiving what a Storm <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi>
was like to raiſe againſt himſelf and the
Papacy, notwithſtanding his <hi>Hoarſneſs,</hi> called upon
him once more, telling him in a very loud Note,
That if he went on oppoſing the Council, he
would bring the Indignation of all <hi>Europe</hi> upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57465:19"/>
his Back, it being plain to every body, that the
Aſſembly of <hi>Baſil</hi> was a General Council, by the
ſame Authority that he was Pope, that is, by the
Authority of the Synod of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> concluding
his Letter to him thus; <q>I have often declared
and proteſted, and I do it now again, in the ſight
of God and Men, That if your Holineſs do not
change your Meaſures, you will infallibly be
the Cauſe of a moſt pernicious Schiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> being taken dangerouſly ſick at this
time, the <hi>Baſileans</hi> when they heard of it, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
a Decree preſently, That in caſe of a Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Roman See, it ſhould not be lawful for
the Cardinals to chuſe a Pope any where, but in
the Place where the Council was ſitting: and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leſt <hi>Eugenius</hi> might, if he died, before his
Death have named ſome Cardinals, they decreed
likewiſe, That ſince the multiplying of Cardinals
was both prejudicial and chargeable to the
Church, it ſhould not be lawful for the Pope to
create any during the Seſſion of the Council; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
at the ſame time a Leaden Seal to be made
for the Uſe of the Synod, which on the one ſide
was to have the Holy Ghoſt in the figure of a
Dove, and on the other, <hi>The Sacred General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Baſil:</hi> and having conſtituted the Cardinal
St. <hi>Euſtathia</hi> Governour and Vicar of the City of
<hi>Avignion,</hi> and named Judges and Proſecutors in
Matters of Faith, and all the other Officers of a
Court of Judicature, they paſſed a Decree, That
no Perſon belonging to the Council, could be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from it to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or to any other
Place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> beginning to fear leſt the Council,
which grew every Day ſtronger and ſtouter,
might, if he did not do ſomething to mollify them,
ſerve him as that of <hi>Conſtance</hi> had done <hi>John</hi> the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57465:20"/>
               <hi>23d,</hi> did, much againſt the grain of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the haughty Spirit of his See, ſubmit ſo
far as to ſend three Nuncios to them; who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a publick Audience made long Harangues of
the Miſchiefs of a Schiſm, and of the great Power
Chriſt had committed to the Pope, were anſwered
by the Fathers, and diſmiſſed with this Meſſage to
their Maſter, that the Sacred Synod could not treat
with him, until by a publick Bull he had revoked
his pretended Diſſolution of it, and did either
come in Perſon, or ſend his Legats to preſide in it.
And the Proſecutors of the Cauſes of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
after that the Term in the Citation was
expired, having demanded that <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſhould
be pronounced Contumacious in order to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
farther againſt him, the ſaid Nuncios
humbly beſeeched the Synod to ſuſpend the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of that Sentence upon their Maſter; which
at the Requeſt of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> was granted; and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Days more were allowed to him to comply
with what was required. During which Term
<hi>Eugenius</hi> ſent other Nuncios with ſome Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Accommodation, the revoking his late
Bull publickly, which the Synod inſiſted on, being
a thing of ſo hard digeſtion, that he did not know
how to ſwallow it. The Propoſitions offered by
the new Nuncios to the Synod were, That <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
if they would revoke all the Decrees they
had made againſt him, was ready to revoke all in
general he had ſaid or done againſt them; and
that if they would conſent to his having called a
Council at <hi>Bononia,</hi> if the Bohemians ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
to come to that City, he was content to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Fathers ſome time to treat with them at
<hi>Baſil,</hi> on condition that when the Term he had
ſet them was expired, they ſhould immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to <hi>Bononia:</hi> Againſt which City if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57465:20"/>
had any juſt Exception, they might name
any other City in <hi>Italy;</hi> and if they would not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to that neither, that they ſhould then name
twelve of the moſt moderate Prelats of their own
Body, in conjunction with the Embaſſadors, to be
Judges of the whole Matter; who, if they ſhould
judg it to be moſt convenient that the Council
ſhould ſit in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſhould name any City there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
for it except <hi>Baſil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fathers being extreamly offended with
theſe ſhuffling Propoſitions, told the Nuncios,
That they could not ſufficiently admire at their
Propoſals, being ſo involved and clogged with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
as if the Matters they came to treat
with them, were not of a religious Nature, and
to be handled with Integrity, but were Matters of
Trade or Commerce, and fit only to be treated
about by Huckſters: A moſt true Character of
all that the Popes did to deſtroy the Supremacy of
Councils: Adding, That ſince <hi>Eugenius</hi> had not
by any thing that they had propoſed, intimated
his being ready to revoke his Bull of Diſſolution,
but on the contrary ſeemed rather to ſeek to have
it confirmed, they could not therefore take any
notice of their Propoſitions, but muſt go on with
their Proceedings againſt him, as a Contemner of
the Authority of General Councils: For the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Security whereof they paſſed a Decree, That
no Perſon ſhould hereafter be capable of being
choſen Pope, who had not given his Conſent and
Aſſent upon Oath to the Doctrine of the Synod of
<hi>Conſtance</hi> concerning the Supremacy of General
Councils, and their being frequently to be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
The laſt Term of ſixty Days being expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Proſecutors moved again to have <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
pronounced Contumacious; which the Fathers
were hindred from doing by Letters they received
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57465:21"/>
from <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> aſſuring them of the Pope's hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by a Bull revoked his pretended Diſſolution of
them, and of his having likewiſe named Legats
to go to <hi>Baſil;</hi> but who being hindred by ſome
juſt Impediments, had appointed Delegats to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their place for ſome time; which Bull of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
as it pretended to be, bore date the
<hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Febr. 1433,</hi> and not 32, as it is in <hi>Bzovius:</hi>
Wherein <hi>Eugenius</hi> after having pretended, that the
Cauſes why he had formerly diſſolved that Council
were all ceaſed, he commanded all Patriarchs,
Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within three Months
after the Date of the ſaid Bull, to repair to <hi>Baſil,</hi>
there to celebrate a General Council, promiſing
to ſend his Legats to preſide therein in his Name.
Which Bull, notwithſtanding it was diſpatched
ſome Weeks before the laſt Nuncios went to <hi>Baſil,</hi>
was never mentioned by them, whoſe Buſineſs was
to try if the Fathers would have been ſatisfied
with leſs, who for that Reaſon knew nothing of
the ſaid Bull, till they were afterwards acquainted
therewith by <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> and the Envoys of ſome
German Princes; who, ſuch as it was, had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
it from <hi>Eugenius:</hi> With which Bull when
it was brought to the Synod by ſome Delegats, the
Pope not being able it ſeems to find one Prelat at
leiſure that was fit to be his Legat on this Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Fathers were more incenſed than ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Eugenius,</hi> for having offered, as if they had
been an Aſſembly of Fools or Children, to put an
Inſtrument upon them; which by calling a new
Council at <hi>Baſil,</hi> confirmed his having diſſolved
the preſent, as a Bull that revoked the Diſſolution
that it confirmed. There was alſo a Paſſage in it,
wherewith the Fathers were highly diſtaſted, which
was, its giving Power to the Preſidents and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats
to diſpatch the Affairs of the Univerſal
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57465:21"/>
Church with the Advice of the Council; this they
ſaid deſtroy'd the Authority of the Council at a
blow, and of Judges, made the Prelats to be only
Counſellors to the Preſidents: whereupon they
having declared at large the ill Conſequences which
muſt attend its being in the Pope's Power to diſſolve
or tranſlate General Councils at his Pleaſure, and
that the Belief of ſuch Councils being the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Authority of the Church, was a Matter of
Faith; and that <hi>Eugenius</hi> therefore for having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
to hear them, deſerved to be treated as an
Heathen and a Publican, they concluded that they
would, after the Example of their Predeceſſors,
die a thouſand Deaths, rather than betray the
Authority of the Church by their Sloth or Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe,
in being ſatisfied with ſuch an hypocritical
Bull, or admitting of Preſidents with ſuch an
Authority as it gave them: and ſo having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
the Delegates with their Bull, they went
on with their Citation of <hi>Eugenius</hi> with greater
Heat than ever. And in their twelfth Seſſion
which was held on the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> after a long
Invective againſt <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Obſtinacy, they had
certainly pronounced him contumacious had they
not been hindred by <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>'s Embaſſadors, who
deſired ſixty days more for him, by which time
they aſſured the Fathers the Emperor would be
with them in Perſon: they decreed nevertheleſs
that at the Expiration of that Term, <hi>Eugenius</hi> if
he did not comply with the Synod, ſhould be <hi>ipſo
facto</hi> ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>But if the Synod was angry with <hi>Eugenius</hi> for
having offered to put ſuch a Trick upon it, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi>
was no leſs angry with the Synod for having
diſcovered his Trick, and by a Bull bearing date
the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> after having declared them to
be a moſt ſeditious Conventicle, he voided and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57465:22"/>
nulled all Decrees, Citations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made by them
againſt him and his Cardinals, commanding all
Chriſtians upon pain of Excommunication not to
have any regard to the <hi>Baſileans,</hi> or to any thing
they did, being a pack of factious Spirits ſet on to
diſturb the Peace of the World.</p>
            <p>But this angry Bull was ſo far from terrifying
the Council, that they had certainly declared him
Contumacious on the day of the Expiration of
the laſt Term, had not their Protector the Duke
of <hi>Bavaria</hi> obtained 30 days more for him; after
the granting whereof, the Archbiſhop, of <hi>Spalato</hi>
and the Biſhop of <hi>Cervina,</hi> the Pope's Nuncios,
knowing nothing of what had paſſed, came to the
Council, deſiring the Fathers not to pronounce
Sentence againſt their Maſter, the 60 days which
had been allowed not being as yet expired. The
Cardinal <hi>Julianus</hi> told them thereupon, that they
had not been acquainted, it ſeem'd, with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil's
having granted the Pope 30 days more, asking
them whether they had brought his Adheſion to
the Synod or not: to which the Nuncios returned
no Anſwer, they having brought only a looſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Propoſition of revoking all that had been
done by the Pope, provided the Synod would do
the ſame as to all that they had done againſt him,
but without any particular mention of the Bull of
Diſſolution, which the Pope could not endure to
think of revoking by a publick Bull. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
having been rejected with Indignation by
the Fathers, the Pope was ſo far provoked thereby,
that he publiſhed another Bull againſt them bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
date the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 
               <q>Wherein having
taken notice of the Synod's having preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
cited him and his Cardinals, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
all Chriſtians under pain of <hi>Anathema,</hi>
to look upon the ſaid Citation, and all the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57465:22"/>
Effects thereof as void and null, he having by
theſe Preſents, in defence of the Dignity of his
Holy See, declared them ſo to be.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But when the thirty days the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
had obtained for <hi>Eugenius</hi> were expired, the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
aſſembled on the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> with a full
purpoſe to have pronounced him Contumacious;
which as they were ready to have done, News
was brought that the Emperor was juſt alighted,
and was making himſelf ready to come to Church
to them: the Fathers overjoy'd at the News went
in a body to wait upon him; who after he had
received their Congratulations, going with them
to the Place of their Aſſembly, prevailed with
them to ſuſpend their Sentence a Week longer,
and when that was expired, he deſired them to
adjourn the paſſing of it till the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>November;</hi>
which day being come, the <hi>14th</hi> Seſſion was held
with great Solemnity, the Emperor aſſiſting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
in his Imperial Robes, and with all his other
Royal <hi>Inſignia:</hi> Wherein the Fathers having at
the Emperor's Requeſt allowed <hi>Eugenius</hi> ninety
days more, they drew up ſeveral Forms of Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
leaving it to him which of them he would
ſign, requiring him particularly, beſides the Bull
of Diſſolution, to repeal and void the laſt three
Bulls he had publiſhed to their Prejudice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius,</hi> notwithſtanding the Council was thus
hard upon him, dreading it now that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
was in it much more than he had done before,
ſent his Letters of Adheſion to it; which having
been preſented to the Synod by the Archbiſhop of
<hi>Tarentum,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Cervina</hi> on the ſecond
of <hi>February,</hi> they were after a ſtrict Examination
declared by the whole Synod to be ſatisfactory,
<hi>Eugenius</hi> having therein comply'd with every thing
the Council had required of him, declaring them
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57465:23"/>
to be, and ſince they met, to have always been a
General Council lawfully aſſembled, revoking his
Bull of Diſſolution, and other two Bulls, denying
the third of the <hi>18th</hi> of the Calends of <hi>January</hi>
to have been his; he alſo with this named Legats
to preſide in the Synod in his Name. The Legats
with the Cardinal <hi>Julianus</hi> were <hi>Nicolaus</hi> Cardinal
of the Holy Croſs, <hi>John</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Tarentum,
Peter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Padua,</hi> and <hi>Luis</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Juſtin:</hi>
who having on the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> taken an Oath
<q>to act faithfully for the Honour of the Council,
and to defend all its Decrees, but eſpecially
the Decree of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> of the
Subjection of the Pope to the Coercive Power
of General Councils in all things belonging to
the Faith, the Extirpation of Schiſm, and the
general <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church in its <hi>Head</hi>
and <hi>Members,</hi> as alſo to give wholſome Counſel
according to God and their Conſciences, and not
to reveal to any Perſon how the Prelats voted,
nor to depart from the Place of the Synod with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
its Leave;</q> they were admitted Preſidents,
but without being allowed any Coercive Power,
all Decrees and other Acts of the Council being
to be expedited as formerly under its own Seal.</p>
            <p>Here we are told a very odd thing if it is true,
which is, that tho theſe Prelats were admitted
Preſidents of the Council as the Pope's Legats,
and did take the forementioned Oaths as Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
nevertheleſs that they took them not in the
Pope's, but in their own Name; a thing naturally
ſo abſurd, and, conſidering how high the Spirit of
the Synod was at this time, ſo incredible, that it
had need to be very well atteſted to be believed
by any indifferent Perſon: it ſeems much more
probable, that thoſe who had the Acts of this
Synod for near an Age intirely in their Hands,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57465:23"/>
might be tempted to foiſt ſuch a Paſſage as this into
them, eſpecially conſidering that ſo great a Point as
that of the Pope's having acknowledged a General
Council to be ſuperiour to him depends thereon,
than that ſuch an Aſſembly ſhould admit Men their
Preſidents as the Embaſſadors of a Prince, and at
the ſame time allow them to take an Oath of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to the Aſſembly in their own, and not in their
Prince's Name. But in whoſe Name ſoever theſe
Oaths were taken, never were Oaths worſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
than they were; the Preſidents from the
firſt minute they took their Place in the Synod,
ſtudying nothing but how to blow it up, by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Factions in it, and gaining Prelats to the Pope
by Promiſes of great Preferments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> having been driven out of <hi>Rome</hi> at this
time by the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s and other Citizens, to whom
he had rendred himſelf extreamly odious, the
whole City crying after him, <hi>Let new Taxes and
the Inventors of them periſh;</hi> when he came to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
writ a very kind Letter to the Council, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them therein for having ſo affectionately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
his Legats Preſidents, promiſing faithfully
for the future, to love them as Sons, obſerve them
as Brethren, and to be bound up with them in the
Bleſſings of the ſame Sweetneſs by a fervent Love.
But the Synod knowing the Man too well to rely
much on any Profeſſions or Promiſes he could make
them, now it had brought him to its own Terms,
would not be diverted by a few good Words from
doing what was neceſſary to the holding of him
and all his Succeſſors to them: and whereas there
were ſome who pretended that the Pope had never
given his Conſent to the Decree of the Synod of
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> which declared a <hi>General Council to be
ſuperior to him,</hi> they reſolved either to remove that
Objection, or to break with the Pope again, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57465:24"/>
accordingly on the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> they made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
declaring that a <hi>General Council derived its
Authority immediately from Chriſt,</hi> and that all
Chriſtians of whatſoever State or Dignity, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
not excepted, were bound in Conſcience to
obey all its Determinations in all matters apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the <hi>Faith,</hi> the Extirpation of Schiſm, and
the general <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Church in its <hi>Head</hi>
and <hi>Members.</hi> To which Decree, coming upon
them before they were well warm in their Chairs,
and while their Maſter was in very bad Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
the Preſidents gave their Conſent; ſo
that howſoever it was before, the Supremacy of
a General Council had now the Pope's Conſent
to it.</p>
            <p>The Council vainly imagining that it had by this
Decree ſecured its own Supream Authority, and
that of all future General Councils, ſince none
hereafter could without denying the Infallibility
of the Church, call the Truth thereof in queſtion,
begun to act as the Supream Church-Authority;
ſending two Cardinals into <hi>Italy</hi> as the Legats of
the Univerſal Church, to reconcile the Princes
and People thereof to <hi>Eugenius.</hi> The thing that
made the Synod the more forward to ſend this
Embaſſy into <hi>Italy</hi> was, <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Adverſaries
making his being an Enemy to the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi>
one of their chief Objections againſt him, which
the Synod now he had ſo affectionately and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
adhered to it, thought it ſelf bound in
Juſtice to remove. The Legats ſent by the Synod
on this Errand, were the Cardinal of the Holy
Croſs, who was one of its Preſidents, and <hi>John
Cervantes</hi> Cardinal <hi>Sancti Petri ad Vincula;</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of which is ſaid not to have conſented to the
forementioned Decree, which is juſt as likely as
that of his having taken the Oath of Preſident in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57465:24"/>
his own Name and not in the Pope's, it being a
very incredible thing that the Synod, if the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
had not conſented to that their darling De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
would have employ'd him ſo ſoon after as
their Legat, and eſpecially in an Embaſſy, which
was to be a Precedent to all future Ages of a
General Council's having Authority to ſend Legats
in the Name of the Univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>But howſoever that were, the Cardinal with
his Colleague having gone with that Character to
<hi>Rome,</hi> after having treated there with the <hi>Colonna</hi>'s
who had the chief hand in driving <hi>Eugenius</hi> out of
that City, he went to <hi>Florence,</hi> where having ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balled
with <hi>Eugenius</hi> how to deſtroy the Council,
he was ſent back to it again with Inſtructions that
in a ſhort time did its buſineſs effectually: for as
he was reckoned to be one of the moſt dextrous
Stateſmen of his time; ſo his main buſineſs at <hi>Baſil</hi>
was to gain the Cardinals and great Prelats over
to <hi>Eugenius</hi> by Promiſes of higher Preferments:
ſo the Cardinal <hi>Capronicus,</hi> whom <hi>Eugenius</hi> had
pronounced not to be a Cardinal, becauſe tho he
was named to that Dignity by <hi>Martin,</hi> he had not
been publickly declared by him before his Death,
and the Cardinal <hi>Julianus</hi> the Preſident, and the
Cardinal <hi>Cervantes,</hi> who were the Pillars the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
chiefly ſtood upon, were all three gained over
to <hi>Eugenius</hi> by ſuch Promiſes; the firſt being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
created a Cardinal by him, and the ſecond
made Cardinal Presbyter of St. <hi>Sabina,</hi> and the
third Cardinal Biſhop of <hi>Oſtium.</hi> Which tamper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Eugenius</hi> with the chief Supporters of the
Council, made it to be in every body's Mouth, that
<hi>Eugenius</hi> would certainly at laſt be too hard for
the Council, he having more Biſhopricks and
other great Preferments in his Gift than the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
had.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:57465:25"/>
But as it was plain to every body, that <hi>Eugenius</hi>
notwithſtanding all his ſolemn Profeſſions to the
contrary, ſtill hated the Council mortally in his
Heart; ſo it was viſible that he was continually
hunting after ſome plauſible Pretence or other to
diſſolve it; or, which would be the ſame to his
purpoſe, to tranſlate it into <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas the Greek Emperor had promiſed
and ſwore by his Embaſſadors, whom he had ſent
to <hi>Baſil,</hi> to come in Perſon, with his Patriarch
and Clergy into the Weſt, to join with that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
in order to the reuniting of the two Churches;
<hi>Eugenius</hi> being ſenſible that the Greeks, if they
ſhould meet the Baſileans any where in a Free
Aſſembly, would unanimouſly concur with them
in eſtabliſhing the Supremacy of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
that being a Doctrine the Greek Church had
not at any time ever in the leaſt doubted of; he
ſpared for no Pains nor Coſt under-hand to divert
that Emperor from being as good as his Oath, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
the Synod of <hi>Baſil</hi> ſecretly, by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as a factious and divided
Body of Men, that agreed in nothing but in an
Intention of deſtroying all Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and having entered into a cloſe Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the Emperor and Patriarch about that
Affair, at the ſame time he pretended to join with
the Baſileans, in perſwading them to come to a
Council in the Weſt: he urged them to inſiſt upon
having that Healing Synod aſſembled at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
to which Place he knew no great Number of
the Baſileans could repair; promiſing whenever it
ſhould be called, to ſend Legats to aſſiſt at it; <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi>
ſo he could but keep the Greeks and Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans
aſunder, having no Concern where that
Council were held, or whether there were ever
any ſuch Council or not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:57465:25"/>
The Synod being informed by its Legats at
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of this ſecret Negotiation of <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
and of his labouring all he could under-hand
by his Agents, who had much more Money to
ſprinkle among the Greeks than they had, to keep
the Emperor and his Clergy from coming to them;
they reſolved, both for their own Security and
that of all future General Councils, to ſet about
the retrenching the great Riches of the Papacy, it
being plain to every body, that till that was done,
it was not poſſible by Paper-Laws and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to keep it long under the Government of an
Aſſembly, that as it was a Body, had not one Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to lay out for Publick Services: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
in its <hi>13th</hi> Seſſion held on the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>June
1435,</hi> it paſſed a Decree, <q>That for the future no
Fees ſhould be paid to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> for
any Eccleſiaſtical Collations, Inſtitutions, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
Confirmations, Elections, Admiſſions,
Inveſtitures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor for Holy Orders, or any
Offices, Benefices, Benedictions, Palls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And that no Annats or Firſt-Fruits ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
longer paid to the ſaid Court, any Cuſtom,
Privilege or Statute to the contrary notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.
Ordaining further, That whoſoever
ſhould hereafter receive any ſuch Fees, ſhould
incur all the Penalties of Simony; and in caſe
the Pope, who of all others was under the
ſtricteſt Obligation to obſerve the Decrees of
General Councils, ſhould be guilty thereof,
that complaint ſhould be made of him to ſuch
Aſſemblies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Decree was violently oppoſed by the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,
who began now to appear as a Party in the
Council, as a Retrenchment that would diſable
the Papacy from doing the Duties that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on it. To obviate that, the Fathers in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57465:26"/>
anſwer to it, promiſed, That if the Popes would
but obſerve the Decrees of General Councils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and exhort all other Chriſtians to do the
ſame, they would by ſome other ways which were
leſs burdenſome, provide a ſufficient Revenue for
all the Occaſions of the Papacy. They gave <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi>
likewiſe the ſame Aſſurance of a ſufficient
Maintenance, upon the ſame Condition, by the
Nuncios they ſent to him to ſatisfy him of the
Juſtice and Neceſſity there was of the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
they had made. We are not told what An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<hi>Eugenius</hi> returned to this Meſſage; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it was, the Synod was ſo ill ſatisfied with it,
that in its next Seſſion held on the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>March
1436,</hi> after having made ſeveral Regulations in
the Election of the Pope, it drew up the Form
<q>of an Oath to be taken by him ſo ſoon as he was
choſen, and to be repeated conſtantly at the
High Maſs of the Anniverſary of his Election;
the main Article whereof was, That he ſhould
obſerve the Decrees of all General Councils,
and particularly thoſe of the General Councils
of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil.</hi> Ordaining farther, That
it ſhould not be lawful for the Pope to advance
any that were near akin to him to any Dignities
or Honours either in the Church or State; or
to encreaſe the Number of Cardinals above 24;
among whom, for the Eaſe of the Church, one
half of the Revenues of the Papacy ſhould be
equally divided.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius,</hi> tho terribly enraged by theſe Decrees,
yet had ſo much wit in his Anger as not to break
with the Synod upon Points he knew to be popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
but choſe rather to do it, upon the Point, where
the Reconciling Council was to be held. And in
order thereunto he diſpatched the Cardinals St.
<hi>Crucis,</hi> and St. <hi>Petri ad Vincula</hi> to <hi>Baſil,</hi> with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57465:26"/>
about it: Who being arrived there, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having declamed againſt the forementioned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments
and Regulations, they muſtered all
their Penſioners together, to try if they could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
it, to have the Reconciling Synod aſſembled in
ſome City of <hi>Italy:</hi> But when it came to be put to
the Vote in what Country the ſaid Synod was to
meet, it was carried by a great Majority that it
ſhould be at <hi>Baſil;</hi> or if that could not be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently,
at <hi>Avignion;</hi> and if that could not be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in ſome City not far from the Sea in the
Dutchy of <hi>Savoy:</hi> By which Majority, tho a very
great one, the Papalins, who now appeared in
their own Colours, were ſo far from being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
according to the Cuſtom of all ſuch Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
that they voted either <hi>Florence</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinum,</hi>
two Cities in <hi>Italy,</hi> to be the Place where the ſaid
Synod was to aſſemble. And having done that,
after a tumultuous manner, they afterwards paſſed
it clandeſtinly into a Decree; which, right or
wrong, they would call a Decree of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Council of <hi>Baſil;</hi> to which <hi>Sham</hi> Decree, not
being able to get the Seal of the Synod, they clapt
that of Cardinal St. <hi>Petri.</hi> And having thus expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
it, they diſpatched it immediately by two
Nuncios to the Pope for his Confirmation; which
being preſently granted by him with both Hands,
he ſent it with all poſſible Expedition, by the
ſame Nuncios that had brought it from <hi>Baſil</hi> to
<hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> with which the ſaid Nuncios, as
Embaſſadors ſent thither by the Council, were to
invite the Greek Emperor and his Clergy to the
Celebration of a Council in one of the Cities of
<hi>Italy</hi> therein mentioned; ſending at the ſame time
a Fleet of Gallies he had hired of the Venetians,
to fetch them to it. Which Nuncios being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> they were in great haſte
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57465:27"/>
to have an Audience; and having obtained one,
they did, in the Name of the Oecumenical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Baſil,</hi> invite the Emperor and his Clergy to
imbark upon the Gallies they had brought for
<hi>Italy,</hi> in one of the two Cities whereof the Pope and
Council were both agreed, that the Synod he had
deſired and promiſed to come to, ſhould be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
The Truth of which Invitation was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
not only by the Embaſſador the Emperor had
ſent to the Pope, but by the Embaſſador likewiſe
whom he had ſent to the Council; both which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
having been corrupted by <hi>Eugenius,</hi> were
ſent along with this Fleet to vouch for the Truth
of all that the Nuncios ſaid. Which was done
likewiſe, tho innocently, by the Council's own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> who having heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the Diviſion the Pope had made at <hi>Baſil,</hi>
and knowing the Nuncios to be Members of that
Synod, had not the leaſt ſuſpicion of their being
Impoſtors, till about a Fortnight after that News
was brought, that a Fleet from the Council, with
its Nuncios aboard, were come the length of <hi>Chios;</hi>
the Report whereof was bore down by the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cios
at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and their corrupted Vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
with an aſtoniſhing Confidence, as a moſt
impudent and groundleſs Lie ſet about on purpoſe
to diſgrace them. But at the end of five Days
the Council's Fleet appeared before the City to
confirm it; which having thrown the Papaline
Nuncios, who did not know what to ſay next,
into a terrible plunge, the Admiral of their Fleet
who was the Pope's Nephew, had he not been
hindred by the Emperor's expreſs Order, had
taken an effectual Way to have helped them out
of it, by having gone out to Sea with an Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to deſtroy the Council's Fleet as a Fleet of
Pirats. On the doing whereof the Nephew had
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57465:27"/>
ſet his Heart ſo much, that he ſent the Emperor
back word, when he received his Order not to
ſtir from his Anchors, that he could not juſtify
his not going out to Sea to deſtroy thoſe Pirats,
being expreſly commanded in his Commiſſion to
do it whenſoever he met them. But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
who could not ſuffer his Coaſt to be ſo affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
ordered the Council's Gallies into the Port of
<hi>Cygneum,</hi> giving an Audience to the Legats that
were on board them, who were the Biſhops of
<hi>Viſoe</hi> and <hi>Lauſan;</hi> on the ſame Day they came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
by whom he was quickly convinced of
their being the Legats of the Council, and of the
former Nuncios being Impoſtors ſent by <hi>Eugenius,</hi>
and that the Decree they brought with them had
been made only by a ſmall and boiſterous Party in
the Synod. But tho the Emperor and Patriarch
were both ſatisfied, that the firſt Fleet was ſent
by <hi>Eugenius,</hi> and not by the Council; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they reſolved to imbark upon it for <hi>Italy,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all that the Council's Legats could
ſay and promiſe to perſwade them to go upon
their Gallies, tho they, reckoning that the Greeks
had been gained by the Papalins by promiſes of
great Succors, and Sums of Money, ſtrived to
outbid them in both, aſſuring the Emperor, that
the Council had all the Weſtern Princes on its
ſide, and that <hi>Eugenius,</hi> if he was not already,
would certainly be depoſed by the Council before
he could get to <hi>Italy.</hi> But when they found this
would not do, their next Buſineſs was to diſſwade
the Emperor, ſince he would not go with them,
from going at all; telling him, it was no proper
time for him to ſeek to reconcile the Greek Church
to the Latin, now that the Latin was ſo divided
within it ſelf; and that therefore it would be his
beſt courſe to put off his Journey till he ſaw how
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57465:28"/>
the preſent Diſpute betwixt the Council and the
Pope would end: In which Diligence they were
ſeconded by all the Greek Eccleſiaſticks who were
named to go with the Emperor and Patriarch in
their Weſtern Expedition.</p>
            <p>But whatever it was that had determined them,
on <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Gallies they would, and did go,
whom I ſhall leave ſailing for <hi>Italy,</hi> and return to
ſee what the Council is doing. It being highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with <hi>Eugenius</hi> for having the Confidence
thus to make uſe of its Name and Authority, not
only in contradiction to what it had decreed, but
with an intention to blow it up, and with it the
Authority of all future General Councils, on the laſt
of <hi>July 1437,</hi> they publiſhed a Monitory and Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<q>againſt him; wherein having accuſed him
of Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Male-adminiſtration,
and of Simony, Prevarication and Perjury, and
of contemning the Authority of a General
Council, it ſummoned him to appear, either in
Perſon, or, being lawfully hindred, by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator
within the term of ſixty Days, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the Crimes he ſtood charged withal;
threatning, if he did not appear, to proceed
againſt him for his Contumacy; nulling at
their next Seſſion all Creations of Cardinals
which were ſaid to have been made by <hi>Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
as alſo the ſuppoſitious Decree that appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Florence</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinum</hi> to be the Place the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
Council was to meet at.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Eugenius,</hi> whoſe Affairs in <hi>Italy</hi> were in a
much better Poſture, while thoſe of the Council, by
reaſon of the Emperor's Abſence from them, and
of his being ingaged in a War in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> were
in a worſe than when he ſtooped to make an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion
to them, was ſo far from obeying this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that by a Bull bearing date the <hi>16th</hi> of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57465:28"/>
               <hi>October,</hi> he tranſlated the Council from <hi>Baſil</hi> to
<hi>Ferrara,</hi> having ſo little regard to the Decree
made by his Baſilian Faction, and which he had
confirmed, and was at that time making uſe of at
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as to name neither of the Places
that are mentioned therein; of which, tho it
was a great Affront to them, we do not read that
his Baſilian Partizans complained, that being a
thing that Penſioners dare not do, tho never ſo ill
uſed by their Patrons. But tho thoſe tame Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
durſt not reſent their having their Authority
thus deſpiſed, the Council which was not under the
ſame Ties to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> ſo reſented his having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to tranſlate it, that without allowing him
one Day after the Expiration of the Term in the
Citation, they ſolemnly pronounced him <hi>Contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious:</hi>
After which, at the Requeſt of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
they granted him three Months to offer
his Reaſons, declaring his pretended Bull of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation
to be void, and making ſeveral Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
about Appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the diſpoſing of
Benefices, to the further retrenchment of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Revenues; and ſo ſoon as the ſaid three Months
were expired, they ſolemnly declared him to be
ſuſpended from the Adminiſtration of the Papacy,
both in Spirituals and Temporals, and that the
Adminiſtration thereof was devolved to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
commanding all Chriſtian Princes and Bodies,
upon pain of Excommunication to be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred,
and all Eccleſiaſticks upon the ſame Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and thoſe of Deprivation, and of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to hold any Preferments, not to yield him
any Obedience for the future.</p>
            <p>After the paſſing of which Sentence, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of a General Council's deriving its Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
immediately from Chriſt, and of all Chriſtians,
the Pope himſelf not excepted, being bound to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57465:29"/>
obey its Decrees, were by the Synod declared to
be Matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> as <hi>Eugenius</hi> for not believing
them was declared to be a <hi>Heretick,</hi> ſeveral of
the Prelats having contended to have had him
declared <hi>Relapſed,</hi> that he might not be capable of
a Pardon, tho he ſhould ſubmit.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Eugenius</hi> was very far from any thoughts
of ſubmitting, ſo the Synod on the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi>
the day appointed for paſſing the Sentence of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
upon him, in a full Aſſembly declared
<q>
                  <hi>Gabriel Condelmore,</hi> which was <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Name
before he was choſen Pope, to have mocked
God and the World by his Prevarications, and
to be guilty of deſpiſing the Authority of this
preſent and all other General Councils, in
having pretended to tranſlate this of <hi>Baſil</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
its own Conſent, and in having refuſed to
appear when cited by the ſaid Synod, and for
continuing contumacious and diſobedient to the
Commands of the Church, and a Diſturber of
her Peace and Unity, and for being an incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible
Schiſmatick, and obſtinate Heretick, a
perjured Perſon, and a Dilapidator of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Pontificate, to have rendred himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of the Papacy, or of any Title, Degree,
Honour or Dignity whatſoever: for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the Sacred and Univerſal Synod of <hi>Baſil</hi> doth
pronounce and ſentence him to be lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the Papacy or Roman Pontificate,
amoving, depriving and throwing him out of
the ſame, reſerving a Power to it ſelf to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
yet further againſt him, and prohibiting
the ſaid <hi>Gabriel</hi> upon pain of Excommunication
to ſtile himſelf any longer Pope, and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
under the ſame Penalty any longer to own
or obey him as ſuch.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After the paſſing of which Sentence, the Synod
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57465:29"/>
having obſerv'd that ſome of its Members were
ſtealing from it daily to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
of his Preferments to all ſuch Deſerters, it
paſſed a Decree that the Synod ſhould not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
but with the Conſent of two thirds of its
ſitting Members, nor be hindred from going on
with the Work it had in hand, and particularly
that of chooſing a new Pope, whoſe Election they
appointed to begin on the <hi>60th</hi> day after that
whereon <hi>Gabriel</hi> was depoſed, ſummoning all the
Cardinals to come to it, and nulling all Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Pactions, Promiſes, Obligations and Oaths
which might pretend to hinder them: But not
expecting that many of the Cardinals would come,
they ordered that 32 of the Prelats, or other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks
of the Synod, ſhould be joined with the
Cardinals, and have Voices in the ſaid Election:
and in caſe the Perſon choſen by the ſaid Electors
ſhould refuſe to accept of that Dignity, that they
ſhould have Power to meet again and chooſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſo on till they had filled the Roman
Chair; preſcribing the form of an Oath to be
taken by the Pope that ſhould be choſe, the main
Point whereof was, that he ſhould ſwear to be
obedient to the Decrees of all General Councils,
and particularly to thoſe of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the paſſing of which Orders, the Synod
finding it would be a tedious Work for ſo great a
Body as it was, to agree in the Nomination of 32
Electors, it thought fit to commit the Nomination
of them to three Perſons, who were to be of
that Number themſelves. The three were <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
a <hi>Scots</hi> Ciſtertian Monk, Abbot of <hi>Dondruina</hi>
in <hi>Galloway,</hi> who had ſtickled hard to have had
<hi>Eugenius</hi> declared a <hi>Relapſed Heretick;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> of
<hi>Segovia</hi> a Spaniard, and Arch-deacon of <hi>Villa Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſa;</hi>
and <hi>Thomas de Courcellis</hi> a French-man, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57465:30"/>
Canon of <hi>Amiens;</hi> who being named by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
took <hi>Chriſtian de Gratzregia</hi> a German, and
Rector of St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Dioceſs of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm,</hi> into their
Number; which four did in a ſhort time name the
other 28, much to the Satisfaction of the Synod;
which 32 with the Cardinal of St. <hi>Cecilia,</hi> the only
Prelat of that Order then remaining in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
did after five Scrutinies chooſe <hi>Amy</hi> the firſt
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> Pope, who had ſometime before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to the Deſart of <hi>Ripoli,</hi> where with ſeveral
of his Nobles he lived as a <hi>Hermite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt here ſtop in the Account of this Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action
to reflect a little on this Scots Abbot, <hi>Thomas</hi>
the <hi>Ciſtertian</hi> Monk, who was choſen the firſt of
the three Electors. It is ſomewhat ſtrange that
none of the Scotiſh Writers ſpeak of him. It
was a great Honour to that Nation to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
a Man of ſo eminent a Character, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo extraordinary an occaſion was ſet at the
head of ſuch a Buſineſs, which was in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to be ſupported by the Credit of thoſe to
whom it was truſted. One ought to think that
both his Learning, his Integrity, and his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were very much diſtinguiſhed, and yet I
do not find that he is known to the Writers of
that Nation, tho the beſt they had, and one of
them the beſt that any Nation ever had, writ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a hundred Years of this time. If <hi>Boethius</hi> and
<hi>Leſley</hi> would take no care to preſerve the Memory
of a Man who was ſo much concerned in ſuch a
Buſineſs, yet how he ſcaped the Diligence of
<hi>Buchanan,</hi> who muſt have valued him the more
for it, is ſomewhat ſtrange: perhaps the caſe with
him was like that of a Prophet who is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Honour ſave in his own Country; or ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient
a thing is Fame and Reputation, that he who
in one Age was eſteem'd the Man of the firſt and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57465:30"/>
moſt diſtinguiſhed Merit of a whole Council, is ſo
forgotten in the next, that even thoſe who have
laboured much and with great Succeſs, <hi>Buchanan</hi>
eſpecially, to raiſe the Value of their Country,
have not mentioned a Man that was ſo great an
Honour to it, and that within memory of the time
in which they writ. But I now return to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of this Matter.</p>
            <p>The Synod, which was extreamly well pleaſed
with the Election, immediately diſpatched the
Cardinal of St. <hi>Cecilia</hi> with 24 Prelats and Nobles,
to acquaint the ſaid <hi>Duke</hi> with his being choſen
Pope; who being perſwaded by the ſaid Cardinal
to accept of the Papacy, he took the Name of
<hi>Felix,</hi> and after having taken the forementioned
Oath, was crowned with great Solemnity at
<hi>Baſil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Cardinal of St. <hi>Cecilia,</hi> who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the Cardinal of <hi>Arles,</hi> for his having
thus adhered to the Council to the laſt, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
by the Papalin Writers of his time, and by
ſome Moderns, as a Monſter made up of Ambition
and Revenge; <hi>Ciaconius</hi> in his Lives of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
calling him the great Reproach and Blemiſh
of his Order: and yet for all that, this Monſter of a
Cardinal was for his extraordinary Piety and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
beatified by <hi>Clement</hi> VII. in the Year 1527,
and has been ever ſince pray'd to with Authority in
<hi>France,</hi> which was done by the Pope without taking
any notice of his ever having repented of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion
to the Council of <hi>Baſil;</hi> by which we may
ſee what Credit the Characters given by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palin
Writers to their Adverſaries deſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Felix</hi> ſo ſoon as he was crowned, diſpatch'd Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats
to all the great Courts, to acquaint them
with his being choſen Pope; by which tho <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus</hi>
and other late Writers will not have him to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57465:31"/>
have been acknowledged, <hi>Sabellicus, Marinul,</hi> and
<hi>Nauclerus,</hi> who writ their Hiſtories about that time,
do affirm he was; and all Writers both of that
Age and ſince that time, do agree that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the Queen
Dowager of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and
ſome other Princes.</p>
            <p>But howſoever the <hi>French King</hi> ſtood affected
to <hi>Felix,</hi> it is certain he was a Friend both to the
Council he was choſen by, and to its Doctrines and
Reformations, the Doctrine of a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil's
being ſuperiour to the Pope being at that
time and ever ſince the Doctrine of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of <hi>Paris;</hi> and as to its Reformations, the
<hi>Pragmatick Sanction,</hi> which was made after <hi>Felix</hi>'s
Election, was taken out of them.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who having in the Year
1438 aſſembled his Synod at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> he had it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
in the firſt Seſſion thereof, that it was a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council lawfully aſſembled,</hi> and that the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of <hi>Baſil</hi> was a <hi>Schiſmatical Conventicle:</hi> after
which having the News brought him of the Greek
Emperor and his Clergy's being landed at <hi>Venice,</hi>
he ſent the Cardinal <hi>St. Crucis</hi> and the Marqueſs of
<hi>Ferrara</hi> to invite them to come to the Council; to
which, after having been ſplendidly entertained
by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they repaired, and were kindly
received by <hi>Eugenius;</hi> who, tho he never reckoned
himſelf ſecure of them till he had them within
the Walls of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> maintained them there ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
long Months, and at a vaſt Charge, before he
aſſembled the Synod, tho it was then in being,
and had had ſome Seſſions juſt before their Arrival.</p>
            <p>But tho we are not told what it was that kept
<hi>Eugenius</hi> ſo long from aſſembling the Greeks in
his Synod, one may, I think, venture to ſay, that
it was nothing but his being ſenſible that in their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57465:31"/>
Principles the Greeks were much greater Enemies
to the Papal Supremacy than the <hi>Baſileans,</hi> in not
only holding that the Pope was ſubject to a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council, but in holding farther, that all the
Primacy he had was derived purely from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
of ſuch Aſſemblies; which, conſidering
what uſe the <hi>Baſileans</hi> would have made of Diſputes
in <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s own Synod upon that Point, made it
not ſafe for him to incorporate the Greeks into it,
until he had by Bribing, Dieting, and ſome other
Methods that required time, made them either
change thoſe Principles, or till he had at leaſt
brought down their Stomachs, which after they
were in <hi>Italy,</hi> were viſibly too high for <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s
Buſineſs with them: for beſides that the Greek
Patriarch had declared at <hi>Venice,</hi> that in caſe he
found the Pope to be the elder Man of the two, he
would then reverence him as his Father, ſo if he
was much about the ſame Age, he would then
treat him as a Brother, and if younger, as a Son;
ſo when the Pope before he landed at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> ſent
him word, that he expected that he and his whole
Clergy ſhould at their firſt Audience adore him
and kiſs his Foot, the Patriarch diſdaining ſuch a
ſervile Submiſſion, ſent back word, that as it
was a thing he had never ſo much as dream'd of,
ſo he was reſolved rather than yield to ſuch a
monſtrous thing, to return home immediately,
without ever ſeeing the Pope: neither would he
be perſwaded to ſet his foot on ſhoar until the Pope
had promiſed not to require that of him, or of any
of his Clergy.</p>
            <p>And tho it was not poſſible for any Aſſembly of
Men to depend more entirely on a ſingle Perſon
than the Greeks did on <hi>Eugenius,</hi> both at <hi>Ferrara</hi>
and <hi>Florence,</hi> to which laſt City he removed them,
on purpoſe to have them cloſer in his Pound than
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57465:32"/>
he had them at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> from which Place ſome of
the chief of the Greek Biſhops had attempted to
have made their eſcape, none of them at either
of thoſe Places having a bit of Bread to put in
their Mouths, but what they had out of the Pope's
Basket; yet for all that Dependance <hi>Eugenius</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had the Courage once to propoſe to them the
thing that was in difference betwixt him and the
<hi>Baſileans,</hi> but was contented, for all the Charge
and Trouble he had been at, with having kept the
Greeks from going to <hi>Baſil,</hi> and with their having
made a general Acknowledgment of the Pope's
being <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Vicar, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor, and <hi>Head
of the Church,</hi> but with ſuch a Limitation as made
that Acknowledgment to ſignify nothing as to the
Authoritative Supremacy by a Divine Right, which
the Pope pretends to; the Greeks as much as
they were mortified, having abſolutely refuſed to
ſubſcribe that Inſtrument, before they had it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
declared therein, that the Pope's Authority
was ſuch as was contained in the Acts and Canons
of General Councils: in all which there is nothing
that makes for that Authoritative Supremacy of
the Pope, but a great deal to prove that he had no
Primacy above his Brethren, but what was given
him by Councils, purely on the Conſideration of
<hi>Rome</hi>'s being the firſt City in the Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> was not ſo weak a Man as to be impoſed
on by the Greeks, in a Submiſſion that was ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
as to ſignify nothing to his purpoſe, but
rather the contrary: but the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill on foot, he durſt not for fear of raiſing
Diſputes in his own Synod about the Papal Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
preſs the Greeks too hard on that Point;
for had it not been for that, <hi>Eugenius</hi> would have
obliged the Greeks both to have kiſſed his Foot,
and to have ſubſcribed to the Papal Supremacy
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57465:32"/>
after another manner than they did, or he would
have ſtarved them for denying to do it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> having diſmiſſed the Greeks, yet that
he might have the Name of a Council ſtill ſitting
on his ſide, ſo long as that of <hi>Baſil</hi> was in being, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a fantaſtical pretence tranſlates the Synod from
<hi>Florence</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> where, without ever having
aſſembled it that we read of, he died in the Year
1446. the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which upon the Plague's
being in that City had tranſlated it ſelf to <hi>Lauſan,</hi>
being ſtill on foot, and Pope <hi>Felix</hi> ſtill alive, tho
not acknowledged by ſo many Princes as he was
at firſt.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Eugenius,</hi> notwithſtanding he had done
little elſe all the time he was Pope than to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
againſt the Eſtabliſhment of the Supremacy
of General Councils, yet had never the Courage
abſolutely to condemn that Doctrine; ſo his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
<hi>Nicolaus,</hi> tho no great Friend to it no more
than <hi>Eugenius,</hi> did never once offer to attack it;
on the contrary by the Compoſition he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to come to with <hi>Felix,</hi> he ſeemed rather to
confirm than condemn the main of what had been
done at <hi>Baſil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pius</hi> the Second, the moſt zealous <hi>Baſilean</hi>
while he was <hi>Aeneas Sylvius,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus,</hi>
ſeemed to have given a Blow to that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
by a Bull prohibiting all Chriſtians up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pain of Excommunication to appeal to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
General Council; and which, to make it the
more formidable, he inſerted into the <hi>Bulla Coenae
Domini,</hi> the Abſolution from whoſe Cenſures is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to the Pope; ſo natural it is for Apoſtates
to outdo all others in Zeal againſt the Party they
have forſaken. But this Bull, tho deſigned every
way to leſſen the Authority of General Councils
in the Minds of People, yet ſince only <hi>future</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57465:33"/>
Councils, but not <hi>General Councils in being,</hi>
were named in it, the <hi>Conſtance</hi> or <hi>Baſil</hi> Doctrine
was not reckoned to be condemned thereby, the
Cardinals themſelves not being ſo much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
againſt thoſe Aſſemblies, as not to deſire to
ſee any more of them: for they being congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
in the Conclave upon <hi>Pius</hi>'s Death, drew up
ſeveral Statutes which every one of them in caſe
he ſhould be choſen Pope, ſwore to obſerve. The
Statutes were, 1. That he ſhould continue the
War againſt the Turks. 2. That within three
Years after his Election he ſhould aſſemble a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council. 3. That he ſhould never increaſe
the Number of Cardinals above that of twenty four,
nor prefer above one of his own Kindred to that
Dignity. 4. That he ſhould diſpoſe of no great
Preferments but in Conſiſtory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which
Statutes, tho they were ſworn to at the Altar
by <hi>Paul</hi> the Second, who was choſen Pope at that
time, both before and after his Election, yet he was
ſo far from obſerving them, that preſently after
he was crowned he made a publick Declaration,
and forced all the Cardinals ſave one to ſign it,
that he was not obliged by the Oaths he had taken
to keep the ſaid Statutes; it being the Popes
Prerogative to make Laws for others, and not to
have Laws impoſed upon them. And as to the
Statute of calling a General Council, he was ſo
far from any thoughts of doint it, that he made
it one of his chief Articles againſt <hi>Platina</hi> and the
other Criticks of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they had threatned,
upon his having perſecuted them ſo barbarouſly
for their Learning, to ſolicite all the Princes of
<hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to have ſuch an Aſſembly called to
keep the Papal Power within ſome Bounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtus</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> who had probably taken the ſame
Oath, before and after his Election, that his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57465:33"/>
had done, ſeemed to be in haſte to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with it; for in the firſt Year of his Pontificate
he called a Council to meet at <hi>Rome;</hi> but being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
by the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> to aſſemble it at
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinum,</hi> where it would have more freedom, he
was ſo little fond of having it any where, that
he dropt it, reckoning it is like that he had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
ſatisfy'd his Oath, by having called ſuch an
Aſſembly, tho it never met. After which, tho
<hi>Sixtus</hi> had nothing farther from his Thoughts
than to call a General Council, his Heart being
entirely ſet on advancing his obſcure Family to
Principalities, to the promoting whereof he was
very certain ſuch an Aſſembly would no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
nevertheleſs the inſufferable Effects of
that Ambition, and particularly that of his having
had his Hand ſo deep in the barbarous Aſſaſſinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Julianus de Medicis</hi> in the Church at High
Maſs, made the <hi>Florentines</hi> and others to wiſh for
ſuch a Synod, to curb and puniſh him for ſuch
enormous Violences.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Florentines</hi> having upon <hi>Sixtus</hi>'s putting
their Common-Wealth under an Interdict, and
following that with an Army, on the account of
their having hanged the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Piſa</hi> for
being concerned in that Murder, and their having
impriſoned the Cardinal of <hi>Florence</hi> upon ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his having been privy to it, aſſembled a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
of all their Prelats; they after having char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Sixtus</hi> with that Murder, and commanded the
Eccleſiaſticks not to regard his Interdict, appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a General Council to have Juſtice done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him.</p>
            <p>The French King likewiſe being ſolicited for
Succours by <hi>Lawrence de Medicis,</hi> who had nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
eſcaped being murdered at the ſame time,
and in the ſame place, with his Brother <hi>Julianus,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57465:34"/>
called an Aſſembly of his Eccleſiaſticks and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
at <hi>Orleance:</hi> In which it being agreed that
the <hi>Pragmatick Sanction</hi> ſhould be reſtored, and
Annats aboliſhed, and a General Council called,
the King ſent an Embaſſador to <hi>Sixtus</hi> to require
him immediately to call a <hi>General Council,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
the Church out of the Bondage it was in,
and to puniſh all that had any Hand in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Murder; threatning, if he did not call one
preſently, to join with the other Princes of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
to do it. To which Meſſage <hi>Sixtus</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the common prevaricating Anſwer of his See,
That he, and not Secular Princes, was the Judg
when the Calling of ſuch an Aſſembly was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and that if the Times would give way to it,
which to his great Sorrow they would not, there
was no Body deſired to have ſuch a Council called
ſo much as he did. Neither was there, during
the Reigns of <hi>Innocent</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the
<hi>6th,</hi> any talk of aſſembling a General Council, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it were by Princes now and then threatning
the Popes with ſuch an Aſſembly, and by the
Famous <hi>Savanorella,</hi> who writ to moſt of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Europe,</hi> exhorting them with great Zeal
to aſſemble a General Council, to preſerve and
reform the Church, and to pull down the <hi>Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Deſolation,</hi> meaning the <hi>Pope,</hi> which <hi>ſtood
in the Holy Place.</hi> For which Zeal the Pope never
gave over perſecuting him, until he had him, with
three more of his Brethren, burnt at <hi>Florence</hi> as
a Hereticks, who notwithſtanding that, is to this
Day reckoned by many of the Roman Church to
have been a Prophet, a worker of Miracles, and
a Perſon of extraordinary Sanctity. But upon
the Death of <hi>Pius,</hi> who reigned but a few Weeks,
the Cardinals who had been moſt terribly tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
over by <hi>Alexander,</hi> being for reſtraining the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57465:34"/>
exorbitant Power of the Papacy, among other
Statutes they obliged themſelves by an Oath, in
caſe they were choſen Pope, to call a General
Council within two Years, in a place of Liberty:
And it having been found by Experience, that the
taking of that Oath by a Cardinal was no tie at
all upon him when he came to be Pope, they ſwore
farther, That they ſhould neither abſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
nor give Power to any other to abſolve
them from the Obligation thereof; and after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus, as they thought, ſecured the Meeting
of a General Council within two Years, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to an Election, and choſe <hi>Julianus Ruvero,</hi>
Cardinal of <hi>Oſtium,</hi> a Prelat who loved War too
well to be obliged by an Oath to embaraſs the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
with Synods, and who accordingly ſuffered
not only two, but <hi>ſeven</hi> Years to paſs without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a Council; and ſo he would <hi>ſeven ſcore</hi> if he
had lived ſo long, notwithſtanding his Oaths,
had not a Council been called by ſome of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
at <hi>Piſa</hi> to examine the Validity of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and to puniſh him for his Male-Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and particularly for not having, according
to his Oath, called a Council within two Years;
and which, had he never taken any ſuch Oath, he
was bound by the Decree of the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
to have called. This <hi>Piſan</hi> Synod was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
chiefly by the French King, who was grown
ſo weary of ſeeing the Church and Chriſtian State
thus deſperately <hi>Pope-rid,</hi> that he had a Medal
ſtruck with this Inſcription, <hi>Delebo Babylonis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
meaning <hi>Rome,</hi> a Name none that have been
angry with the Popes for theſe twelve hundred
Years, have ever miſſed to call that City by. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
to ſtrengthen himſelf againſt this <hi>Piſan</hi> Synod,
called one at the <hi>Lateran,</hi> a notable Place for
Liberty, throwing the blame of his not having
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57465:35"/>
called it ſooner, upon the Wars and Diſtractions
of the Times, which were chiefly of his own
creating: And as to the Decree of the Council of
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> he put that off by affirming, That it
had not been regarded in eighty Years; or if it
had, the Diſtractions of the Times would have
juſtified him in not obeying it. Which <hi>Lateran</hi>
Council, tho called after this manner, and made
up chiefly of a few Italian Prelats, is reckoned by
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and the other Court of <hi>Rome</hi>-Writers,
only for its having been in abſolute Subjection to
the Pope, to have been a General Council, and
ſuch a one too as ought to be a Pattern for
Tameneſs to all future Synods: Nevertheleſs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
its being a Precedent for General Councils
having nothing of Authority or Liberty left
them, it did nothing to the Prejudice of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>
Eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>After this of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> which was continued
for ſome time by <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>10th,</hi> there was no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
called by any Pope, until ſuch another was
convocated at <hi>Trent</hi> in the Year 1545, by <hi>Paul</hi> the
<hi>3d;</hi> and after a Tranſlation of three Years to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi>
was reaſſembled by <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>3d;</hi> and who
before he would congregate it, had the Emperor's
Promiſe under his Hand, that nothing ſhould be
done therein that he was not for having done.
And after a Prorogation of 11 Years by <hi>Pius</hi> the
<hi>4th,</hi> an Aſſembly it was ſo fettered by the Popes
under whom it ſat, that from firſt to laſt, nothing
that looked like Liberty or Authority ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in it, the Pope that firſt called it having
ſtrictly charged his Legats who were its Preſidents,
not to ſuffer any Point of his Authority to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
therein, nor to publiſh any Decree in a Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
before they had ſent a Copy thereof to him,
and to a Congregation he had erected at <hi>Rome,</hi> on
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57465:35"/>
purpoſe to direct what was fit to be done at <hi>Trent;</hi>
whoſe Reſolutions being diſpatched to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
were punctually obſerved by them. Theſe
Preſidents, beſides their having aſſumed a new
Authority of <hi>propoſing</hi> all that was to be offered to
the Council, and their having by a Band of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
ſecured the major Vote to themſelves, if
any Prelat had the Honeſty and Courage to oppoſe
any of the Papal Deſigns, they did brow-beat and
ſilence him in the rougheſt manner; and in caſe
the Synod ſhould on any occaſion prove Refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they had a Bull always ready in their Pocket,
impowring them to tranſlate or prorogue it; as
they did twice upon frivolous Pretences.</p>
            <p>Now that this was the true State of the <hi>Trent</hi>
Synod, in that Seſſion of it which was held under
<hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> is proved beyond all contradiction
by the following Letters; of which, and the great
Men they were writ by, I come now to give ſome
Account.</p>
            <p>The following Letters were writ from <hi>Trent,</hi>
during the Seſſion of the Council which was held
under <hi>Julius</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> to <hi>Granvill</hi> then Biſhop of
<hi>Arras,</hi> who was afterwards the Cardinal <hi>Granvill,</hi>
at that time firſt Miniſter to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi>
the <hi>5th,</hi> by <hi>Don Franciſco Vargas,</hi> Doctor of Law,
and Fiſcal or Remembrancer of the Exchequer to
the Emperor, by whom he was ſent to <hi>Trent</hi> when
the Council firſt met in that City under <hi>Paul</hi> the
<hi>3d;</hi> where having remained till it was upon a falſe
Pretence tranſlated by that Pope to <hi>Bononia,</hi> he
was ſent to that City to proteſt in the Emperor's
Name, againſt its having been tranſlated thither:
Which he did with ſo much Courage and Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as raiſed his Name very high for an able
Stateſman; for which Reaſon when the Council
came to be aſſembled at <hi>Trent</hi> again by <hi>Julius,</hi> he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57465:36"/>
was ſent thither by the Emperor to aſſiſt his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
in all their Negotiations with the Legat,
who at that time was the Cardinal <hi>Creſcentius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to <hi>Vargas</hi>'s Talents, were there nothing elſe
to prove them to have been extraordinary, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Letters would abundantly do it; in which
with a great Variety of Learning, and a Noble
Air of Integrity and Piety, is joined ſuch a ſtrength
and clearneſs of Judgment, as is hardly to be met
with in any of the Letters of the moſt eminent
Stateſmen now extant. I will not ſay, becauſe I
read of another of the ſame Name who was Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of State to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick, that the
Writer of theſe Letters is the <hi>Vargas</hi> meant by
the Spaniards, in their Proverbial Saying upon any
Matters being ſo intricate as to require a ſtrong
Head to be able to unriddle it, <hi>Averiguelo Vargas,</hi>
let <hi>Vargas</hi> diſpatch it; yet this is certain, that
our <hi>Vargas</hi> was looked upon by the Emperor and
all his Miniſters, as the moſt dextrous Man at Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of any Spaniard of his Time; upon whoſe
having acquitted himſelf ſo much to the Emperor's
Satisfaction at <hi>Trent,</hi> he was preſently after the
Prorogation of the Council, ſent Embaſſador by
the Emperor to the Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> from
whence, after having reſided there ſome time, he
was recalled, but with an Intention of ſending him
thither again with a double Character of Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
both from the Emperor and his Son <hi>Philip;</hi>
the Deſign whereof was, to have helped <hi>Spain</hi> by
that means, after it ſhould come to be ſeparated
from the Empire, to the Precedency of <hi>France:</hi>
Which being a thing <hi>Charles</hi> had ſet his Heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
extreamly, he pitched upon <hi>Vargas</hi> as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of all his other Miniſters, that was the fitteſt
to manage ſo important and difficult a Point. But
tho the French were too wiſe a Nation to have
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57465:36"/>
ſuch a Trick as that double Commiſſion was put
upon them, and had too good a Cauſe to be baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
in it, in ſo wiſe a Government as that of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi>
it was nevertheleſs acknowledged by all,
that <hi>Vargas</hi> ſaid and did all that was poſſible in
ſuch a Caſe. So that <hi>Si Pergama dextra,</hi> &amp;c. And
tho Embaſſadors, and eſpecially Spaniards, are
not very forward to extol the Abilities of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
that are ſent to aſſiſt them in their Buſineſs;
nevertheleſs we have <hi>Don Franciſco de Toledo,</hi> who
was one of the Emperor's Embaſſadors at <hi>Trent</hi> at
the time when theſe Letters were writ by <hi>Vargas,</hi>
giving the following Character of him to the
Biſhop of <hi>Arras,</hi> in a Letter bearing date the <hi>1ſt</hi>
of <hi>December 1551.</hi> 
               <q>What your Lordſhip writes
concerning your being ſatisfy'd with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Fiſcal <hi>Vargas,</hi> gives me great
Content, knowing him to be one of the moſt
Learned and beſt qualified Perſons of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and withal very zealous for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Service, and much devoted to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
your Lordſhip is therefore bound to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
him with his Majeſty, and to ſee that he
be rewarded according to his Merits and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
which I ſhall take as a great Kindneſs,
he being a Perſon for whom I have a particular.
Affection, being much beholden to him for the
Aſſiſtance he has afforded me, of which your
Lordſhip takes notice: In a word, he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
ſuch an Original, as is not to be quoted
again.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>de Malvenda,</hi> who was likewiſe one of the
Emperor's Miniſters at <hi>Trent</hi> at that time, in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Biſhop of <hi>Arras</hi> which I here publiſh,
bearing date <hi>February 27, 1552,</hi> ſaith, <q>In all our
Encounters with the Legat, the Senior Fiſcal
has ſtill fallen upon wonderful Expedients;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57465:37"/>
who being a Perſon of great Learning, and
withal much experienced in Affairs of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
has not, as I am able to witneſs for him,
been miſtaken in any one Point.</q> And in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Letters, I publiſh likewiſe, bearing
date the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>October 1551,</hi> he tells the Biſhop
of <hi>Arras,</hi> 
               <q>The Fiſcal is certainly ſuch a Perſon
as you take him to be, that is, a Man of ſtrong
Senſe and Judgment, and very ſerviceable in
giving ſuch Directions as are neceſſary about
the Council.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now as <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th</hi>'s Kindneſs for <hi>Vargas,</hi>
whom he knew to have writ ſo freely of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
and Abuſes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
of the Jugglings of the Popes and their Miniſters,
is an Evidence of his having, when he reigned,
been no great Bigot for Popery; ſo we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to believe, that after his Retirement, when he
came to make the ſtudy of Religion his whole Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
he had his Mind ſo enlightned, as to diſcover
both the Errors and Corruptions of Popery, and
the Truth and Beauty of the Proteſtant Doctrines
ſo far, as to have died in the Faith of the latter;
of which, conſidering among whom he died, and
how much all the Monks and Friars of <hi>Spain,</hi> if
it had been ſo, would have been concerned to have
ſuppreſſed it, tho a direct and poſitive Proof is a
thing not to be expected; nevertheleſs not only his
Chaplain and Preacher, but he likewiſe who was
his Confeſſor at his Death, as alſo the Arch-Biſhop
of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who aſſiſted him in his laſt Minutes
with Ghoſtly Counſel, being all accuſed, as they
were, of being Proteſtants, is ſuch an Evidence
of that Prince's having been of the ſame Religion,
as an impartial Mind can hardly know how to
reſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:57465:37"/>
For, 1. As to his Chaplain and Preacher <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin
Cazal,</hi> who was Canon of the Church of
<hi>Salamanca,</hi> and is acknowledged by his Enemies to
have been one of the moſt Eloquent Preachers that
ever <hi>Spain</hi> produc'd; he was taken up by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition</hi>
for being a Proteſtant in the Year 1558,
and was with 13 more, who died profeſſing the
Proteſtant Religion, <hi>burnt</hi> publickly at <hi>Valladolid</hi>
in the Year 1559. the unfortunate Prince <hi>Charles,</hi>
and his Aunt <hi>Dona Joanna,</hi> who was Governeſs of
<hi>Spain</hi> at that time, being Spectators of that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Execution.</p>
            <p>2. His Confeſſor <hi>Conſtantine Poncius,</hi> who was
Canon of <hi>Sevil,</hi> and a Perſon of wonderful Piety
and Learning, was likewiſe taken up by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
for being a Proteſtant; who dying in
Priſon, the Inquiſitors know beſt of what Death,
had his Bones and Effigies burnt publickly in the
Market-place of <hi>Sevil</hi> in the Year 1560, as were
alſo the Bones of the Learned Dr. <hi>Egidius</hi> Canon
of <hi>Sevil,</hi> who had been named by the Emperor to
the Biſhoprick of <hi>Fortoſa,</hi> who either died, or was
murdered in the ſame Priſon, eighteen being burnt
alive at the ſame time for being Proteſtants: on
which occaſion the Writer of the Hiſtory of the
Inquiſition ſaith, <q>That had not that holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
taken care thus to put a ſtop to thoſe
Reformers, the Proteſtant Religion had run
through <hi>Spain</hi> like Wild-fire, People of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
and both Sexes being wonderfully diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
at that time to have embraced it.</q> Nay, the
Author of the Pontifical Hiſtory, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at ſome of thoſe Martyrdoms, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
at that of <hi>Herrezulo,</hi> ſaith, <q>That had thoſe
Learned Men been let alone but three Months
longer, all <hi>Spain</hi> would have been put into a
Flame by them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:57465:38"/>
Laſtly, <hi>Bartholomew de Caranza,</hi> a Dominican
Friar, who had been Confeſſor to our Queen <hi>Mary,</hi>
and who upon her Recommendation was preferred
to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> having aſſiſted
<hi>Charles</hi> with his Ghoſtly Counſel in the laſt Minutes
of his Life, was not many Months after confined
to his Palace by the Inquiſition in the Village of
<hi>Tordelaguna,</hi> upon ſuſpicion of his being a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant;
from which place, after a Confinement of
ſeven Years, he was removed to <hi>Rome,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Caſtle of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
a cloſe Priſoner ten Years, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
at laſt as one ſuſpected of Hereſy. This
Arch-biſhop was reckon'd one of the moſt learned
Divines of his time, and as ſuch, was ſent by
<hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> where he
both preached before that Synod, and writ a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of the Perſonal Reſidence of Biſhops and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors;
he publiſhed likewiſe a Compendium of all
the Councils, and a large Catechiſm in Spaniſh,
which was printed in <hi>Flanders:</hi> of which Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop,
and the three forementioned Martyrs, I
think one may truly ſay, that they were Perſons
every way qualified to have reformed a corrupted
Church after the beſt manner. But that God, after
he had raiſed up ſuch great Men, to have done
ſo excellent a Work, ſhould ſuffer a barbarous
and inhuman Court thus to deſtroy both their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and all the Effects of their holy Labours, is a
Myſtery of Providence, whoſe Ways, tho always
righteous, are many times great Depths.</p>
            <p>To theſe Evidences of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th</hi>'s having
died a Proteſtant, I ſhall only add, that his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had lived ſome
time with him in his Monaſtery, was afterwards
impriſoned by his Father <hi>Philip,</hi> and, as was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
believed, was put to death by him, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57465:38"/>
of Proteſtants; and what <hi>Mezeray</hi> a Papiſt
ſaith thereof in the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, is
remarkable.</p>
            <p>
               <q>At <hi>Philip</hi>'s Arrival in <hi>Spain,</hi> he cauſed a great
many to be burnt in his own Preſence at <hi>Sevil</hi> and
<hi>Valladolid</hi> of thoſe they call <hi>Lutherans,</hi> both Men
and Women, Gentlemen and Eccleſiaſticks, as
likewiſe the Effigies or Fantom of <hi>Conſtantine
Ponce,</hi> Confeſſor to <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th:</hi> we muſt not
wonder that he ſcrupled no more the defaming
his Father's Memory, ſince if we will believe
ſome, he would have made his Proceſs too, and
have burnt his Bones for the Crime of Hereſy,
nothing hindring him from it but this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
That if his Father were an Heretick
he had forfeited his Eſtates, and by conſequence
had no right to reſign them to his Son.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sandoval</hi> in his Life of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> takes great
pains, by falſe Relations, to clear his Hero from
this Suſpicion, as by ſaying, that <hi>Charles</hi> when the
Arch-biſhop of <hi>Toledo</hi> came to him, would not,
tho he had deſired to ſee him, ſo much as ſpeak to
him. But as <hi>Spondanus</hi> well obſerves, there is little
Credit to be given to what <hi>Sandoval</hi> writes of that
Emperor, who under the Title of his Life, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to write only an Encomium of him. And
that it may not look ſtrange, that the Biſhop of
<hi>Arras,</hi> who when he was Cardinal <hi>Granvill,</hi> was
for his Bigotry for Popery, called in <hi>Flanders</hi> the
<hi>Prince of Papiſts,</hi> ſhould be ſo much a Friend to
<hi>Vargas,</hi> who had writ his Mind ſo freely to him
concerning the Corruptions of the Roman Church,
and the Jugglings of the Popes and their Miniſters,
the Reader is to know that that Prelat chang'd his
Temper as to the Affairs of Religion with his
Maſter; he who was the chief Champion for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
under <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>2d,</hi> having, after theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57465:39"/>
were writ to him, puſhed on his old Maſter
<hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> to invade the Papal Territories
with a ſtrong Army, in order to ſtrip the Pope
of all his Lands and Temporal Juriſdictions;
which was accordingly attempted by the Duke of
<hi>Alva,</hi> at that time Viceroy of <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Vargas:</hi> When he was at <hi>Trent,</hi>
he writ oftner than once to the Biſhop of <hi>Arras,</hi>
that there was no Buſineſs to be done there, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
being only the Executioner of the Orders that
came from <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that if there was any good to
be done, which he much doubted of, it was to be done
at that Court. <hi>Philip</hi> the Second accordingly, when
the Council, after a Prorogation of 11 Years, came
to meet again under <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> ſent <hi>Vargas</hi> his
Embaſſador to the Pope, with whom we are told he
laboured hard to have aſſerted the Liberty and
Authority of the Council, and to have had thoſe
Miſchiefs remedied that he had formerly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of at <hi>Trent.</hi> The Pope, ſaith Mr. <hi>de'l Iſle,</hi>
who was the French Embaſſador at <hi>Rome</hi> at the
ſame time, at an Audience I had of him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of a long Debate he had with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
<hi>Vargas</hi> about the words, <hi>Proponentibus Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis,</hi>
which <hi>Vargas</hi> would have had ſo altered,
that the Biſhops might not be deprived of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of <hi>propoſing</hi> what they had a mind to in the
Synod; <hi>The Pope told me,</hi> ſaith <hi>de'l Iſle, that he put
him off at laſt by telling him, that he had ſomething
elſe to do than to diſpute about what Caſe and Gender
Words were of:</hi> Which was a pleaſant way of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an end to a Debate whereon the Authority of
the Council ſo much depended. But the truth is,
<hi>Vargas</hi> was a Perſon the Pope was too angry with
to treat him civilly, as we are told by the ſame
French Embaſſador, who ſaith, <hi>Mr.</hi> Vargas <hi>has
a Mark ſet upon him at</hi> Rome <hi>on the account of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57465:39"/>
Diſpatches that have been made by him both in</hi> Spain
<hi>and at</hi> Trent, <hi>wherein he had complained of the Pope's
having the Council in ſubjection to him, and had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
the Prelats thereof to aſſert their Liberties: With
which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Pope is much offended, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
it highly againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Count <hi>Brocard,</hi> who was ſent by <hi>Pius</hi> to the
Court of <hi>Spain</hi> upon extraordinary Buſineſs, was
commanded at the end of his Inſtructions to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit
vehemently the calling home of <hi>Vargas,</hi> as
a Perſon no ways acceptable to his Holineſs: But
when <hi>Pius</hi> found he could not get him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called,
he courted him to that degree, as to gain
him at laſt, if <hi>Pallavicino</hi> may be believed, to
write in defence of his Authority to the Spaniſh
Biſhops that were at the Council; but before he
was brought to that, if he ever did it, we ſhall
find him writing to the ſame Prelats, to do things
which muſt have incenſed the Pope more againſt
him than all that he had ever ſaid or done before.</p>
            <p>For whereas the Spaniſh Biſhops (who at the
opening of the Council under <hi>Pius</hi> had all inſiſted
on having the preſent Council declared to be a
Continuation of the former, and to have in all
its Acts the Title of <hi>Eccleſiam <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalem reprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentans</hi>
given to it, and on having the words <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponentibus
Legatis</hi> not uſed) were all, except the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Learned Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> grown
ſlack in the proſecution of thoſe Points; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
<hi>Vargas</hi> did thereupon write a long Letter
to that Archbiſhop, who was his particular Friend,
which was to be communicated to all the reſt
of his Brethren, wherein he earneſtly exhorted
<q>them to reſume their former Zeal, and either to
carry thoſe important Points, or to withdraw
from the Synod; or in caſe that ſhould be thought
too much, to get the Determination of them at
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57465:40"/>
leaſt deferred until the Embaſſador ſhould come
to them; declaring every thing that had
been done to the detriment of thoſe Points, to
be both of its own nature void, and never to
have been enacted by any Lawful Authority.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When this Letter was writ, which was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Months before the end of the Synod, <hi>Vargas</hi>
was undoubtedly ſtill of his old Principles for
which the Pope was ſo angry with him; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<hi>Pallavicino,</hi> whoſe Reſentments, right
or wrong, are always the ſame with the Pope's,
reflecting on that Letter, ſaith, Thus <hi>Learning,
when accompanied with a diſturbed Mind, can betray
People into ſuch Errors, as they could never have fallen
into had they been ignorant:</hi> And having nothing
elſe to object againſt <hi>Vargas</hi> and his Friend the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> on this occaſion, he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the former of <hi>not being ſo nobly deſcended as
the Spaniſh Embaſſadors to the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>uſed to
be;</hi> and the latter of not <hi>being ſo good a Gentleman
as the Biſhop of</hi> Salamanca, <hi>who was Brother to the
Duke</hi> de Infantada.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pallavicino</hi> reflects likewiſe ſeverely on <hi>Vargas</hi>
upon the account of a Speech that was made by
him before the Pope, concerning the Nature and
Uſe of General and National Councils, at a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all the Embaſſadors, except the French, that
were then in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaying, <q>As it commonly
happens to an unſeaſonable Oſtentation of Parts,
ſo <hi>Vargas</hi> was rather laugh'd at as a vain Man
for that Diſcourſe, than praiſed for it as a Man
of Learning.</q> But as to what <hi>Pallavicino</hi> ſaith of
<hi>Vargas</hi>'s having in that Diſcourſe inveighed ſtoutly
againſt National Councils, I do not believe it, any
farther than that he might reflect perhaps upon
that which the French threatned to call about that
time, and that for two Reaſons; 1. Becauſe this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57465:40"/>
Speech was ſpoke by him ſometime before the
writing of the forementioned Letter, when it is
certain he had not ſwerved from his old Principles
contained in the following Letters; one whereof
was, That if the Church was ever to be reformed,
it muſt be done by <hi>National</hi> and not <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi>
from which, as they are now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Pope, nothing but Miſchief and
the Eſtabliſhment of Abuſes was to be expected.
2. Becauſe <hi>Pallavicino</hi> was angry with him for that
Diſcourſe, which, if an Invective againſt National
Councils in general had been any part of it, he
would never have been.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have heard nothing of <hi>Vargas</hi> but
what was all of a piece, and tended to the aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Liberty and Authority of the Council,
in conformity with what is delivered by him in
the following Letters. But as it is too common
for People, who, by an extraordinary Dexterity
in Buſineſs, have raiſed themſelves to high Poſts,
to do things rather than be tumbled down from
them, which they would have abominated the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thoughts of while they were in their low Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
ſo this great Miniſter, finding after he had
by his eminent Abilities raiſed himſelf to the moſt
honourable Employment of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi>
that by his noted and ſingular Zeal for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Council, and particularly by his late
Letter to the Biſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> he had drawn
the whole Indignation of the <hi>Vatican</hi> on his Head,
ſo that he muſt either tack about and do ſomething
to mollify the Pope, or venture to be cruſh'd by
him, by bidding him an open Defiance; his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if <hi>Pallavicino</hi> may be believed, unhappily
prevailing over his Integrity, he made a ſhort
turn, and of a Veteran Champion for the Council
againſt the Pope, became a Champion for the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57465:41"/>
Pope againſt the Council, or at leaſt againſt the
ſoundeſt part of it, and with which he had been
ſo long united: of which ſudden Change <hi>Pallavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cino</hi>
gives us the following Account.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſh Prelats being reſolved to have Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
declared by the Council to be an Order of
Men of Chriſt's immediate Inſtitution, which is a
Doctrine the Popes will diſſolve an hundred Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
rather than give their Conſent to; <hi>Pius</hi> in
order to prevent the Storm which the denial of
that Point to the Spaniards would in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
raiſe in the Synod, called a ſelect Number of
Cardinals, and among them the Embaſſador <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas,</hi>
to conſult about the beſt way of diverting it.
With which unuſual Civility and Confidence of
the Pope <hi>Vargas</hi> was ſo far overcome, that he
was perſwaded by him to write a Treatiſe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his Authority. With which after he had
read it, <hi>Pius</hi> was ſo well pleaſed, that not being
content with <hi>Vargas</hi>'s having writ the Heads there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to <hi>Trent,</hi> he diſpatched a Courier thither on
purpoſe, the day after the Heads were ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with the whole Treatiſe, expecting great
matters from it in that Juncture: Which Treatiſe,
tho <hi>Pallavicino</hi> ſaith it was afterwards printed, and
the <hi>Bibliotheca Hiſpanica</hi> ſpeaks likewiſe of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
printed by <hi>Franciſco Vargas,</hi> whoſe Title was
<hi>De Epiſcoporum Juriſdictione, &amp; Pontificis Maximi,</hi>
I have never been able to compaſs the ſight of,
nor to meet with an account in any Book, nor from
any Perſon, how thoſe two Juriſdictions are ſtated
in it; wherefore all that I can ſay of it, is, that if
to curry favour with the Pope, <hi>Vargas</hi> has therein
made Biſhops not to have their Authority imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from Chriſt, then he flatly contradicts
himſelf, having poſitively affirmed the contrary
in ſeveral of the following Letters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:57465:41"/>
               <hi>Pallavicino,</hi> who is the only Writer I know
of that takes notice of this great Change in <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas</hi>'s
Principles, tells us farther, That when the
putting an end to the Synod was fiercely oppoſed
by the Count <hi>de Luna,</hi> the Spaniſh Embaſſador at
<hi>Trent,</hi> the Pope being much troubled at that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
was aſſured by the Embaſſador <hi>Vargas</hi> of
that Count's having no Order from his Maſter for
what he did; and that <hi>Vargas</hi> having writ a very
earneſt Letter to the Count about it, ſhewed a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of it to the Pope; who being extreamly pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it, diſpatched it to his Legats, to choke
the Count with it if he went on with his Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Which Inſtance of <hi>Vargas</hi> having changed
his Meaſures, whatever the former may be, we
have great reaſon to believe is falſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
Father <hi>Paul</hi> agrees with <hi>Pallavicino</hi> as to
the main of it: for beſides that <hi>Spondanus</hi> writes
poſitively, that <hi>Vargas</hi> upon the Count <hi>de Luna</hi>'s
having writ to him about that Buſineſs, did tell
the Pope roundly, That the Council muſt not be
diſſolved, ſince all the World was for having it
continued; and that being asked by the Pope what
he meant by all the World? he anſwered, <hi>Spain;</hi>
whereupon the Pope, in railery, adviſed him to
buy <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s Geography, and to ſend it into
<hi>Spain,</hi> to teach his Country-men that <hi>Spain</hi> was
not all the World: I ſay, beſides this, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>Philip</hi> was ſo highly diſpleaſed with the
Pope for having put an end to the Council ſo
ſoon, that he had like to have broke with him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
            <p>This is all I have been able to meet with in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
relating to Dr. <hi>Vargas,</hi> the Writer of the
25 following Letters, and a Treatiſe about Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:57465:42"/>
But beſides <hi>Vargas</hi>'s 25 Letters, and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
which are all Originals, I do here likewiſe
publiſh three of <hi>Don Franciſco de Toledo</hi>'s, who was
the Emperor's Embaſſador at the Council, and one
of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Saçor,</hi> who in the printed
Catalogues of the <hi>Trent</hi> Biſhops, is called <hi>Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopus
Turitanus;</hi> and three (together with a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial)
of the Biſhop of <hi>Oren,</hi> who is called in
them <hi>Epiſcopus Aurienſis;</hi> and one of the Biſhop
of <hi>Aſtorga;</hi> and three of the Biſhop of <hi>Pamplona,</hi>
and ſix of Father <hi>Malvenda</hi>'s, who was both one
of the Emperor's Miniſters, and Divines at that
Council: Which Letters are all Originals, and
were all writ in Spaniſh at that time from <hi>Trent</hi>
to the Biſhop of <hi>Arras,</hi> and do all agree in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That the Council had nothing of Liberty or
Authority in it; and that there was nothing
done at <hi>Trent,</hi> but what the Pope was pleaſed to
order.</p>
            <p>There are, beſides theſe I have publiſhed, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Letters of <hi>Don Franciſco de Toledo</hi>'s,
writ with his own Hand, which is ſo wretched a
Scrawl, that there is no reading of it; the three
of his I publiſh being writ by another Hand, but
ſigned by himſelf: As alſo ſeveral Letters of the
Biſhops of <hi>Badajoz, Pamplona, Elna, Jubin, Sego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,
Algueir, Arvorca,</hi> all writ at the ſame time
from <hi>Trent</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>Arras;</hi> and which,
tho all Originals, and very legible, yet having
nothing in them relating to the Council, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Publick Affairs, I did not think it neceſſary to
trouble the World with them.</p>
            <p>Now as I do reckon that it will be no eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for any one, after his having read the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Letters and Papers, to judg the Conventions
which were at <hi>Trent</hi> under <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>3d,</hi> and <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
the <hi>3d,</hi> to have been Aſſemblies that had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57465:42"/>
of <hi>Liberty</hi> in them: So to ſatisfy the Reader
that it was the ſame with the Convention which
was held at the ſame Place under <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> I
have added a Letter of Monſieur <hi>Lanſac,</hi> who was
at that time Embaſſador to the Council from the
Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and one of Monſieur <hi>Xainctes,</hi>
a Doctor of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> who aſſiſted at it as a Divine,
which are both printed in French, in the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Miſſives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude: tho the Doctrine of the Synods
of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> of a General Council's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuperiour to the Pope, has never as yet been
condemned by any Roman Council that pretended
to be Univerſal, yet through that Doctrine's being
diſcouraged at <hi>Rome,</hi> the great Fountain of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,
as a thing ſavouring of <hi>Hereſy,</hi> as alſo
through the Power the Popes were ſuffered to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
in the Synods of <hi>Florence,</hi> the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and
this of <hi>Trent,</hi> ſuch Aſſemblies are no leſs in Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
to the Pope, than they could have been, had
all Councils owned him to be their Abſolute Lord
and Maſter. Of which the Court of the General
Inquiſition at <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo ſenſible, that in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
publiſhed by it, in a Congregation held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Pope in the Year 1659, it declared, That
the deciding of Controverſies of Faith or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Univerſal Church, belonged <hi>ONLY to
the Judgment of the See of</hi> Rome, not fearing ever
to be queſtioned for ſuch high Prerogative Doctrin
by any future General Council.</p>
            <p>It is now time to bring an Introduction, that
has grown already perhaps too long, by reaſon of
the variety of the Matter that I thought fit to bring
within it, tho as ſhort as I could, to a Concluſion.
But before I end it, I know it may be expected
that I ſhould give an Account of the Letters and
Papers that I do now publiſh in a Tranſlation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:57465:43"/>
They are all Originals, the Seals of moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
the Subſcriptions and Directions ſhew it,
beyond the poſſibility of Contradiction. They
are writ in Spaniſh, moſt of them fair enough to
be read, tho ſome are very hard to be read.
They were put in my Hands by that moſt Eminent
Divine Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> now the moſt worthy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Worceſter;</hi> who upon my return from <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
finding that I had made my ſelf well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Spaniſh Tongue, having ſtaied
many Years there, deſired me to be at the pains
to tranſlate them. I ſoon found what a valuable
Treaſure I had in my Hands, and therefore
asked him by what Conveyance they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Hands. He told me they were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
to him by the Right Honourable Sir
<hi>William Trumbull,</hi> one of his Majeſty's Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Secretaries of State, to whom they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
among his Grandfather's Papers, who
had been Envoy in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the
Firſt at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> for 15 Years, where he had got
thoſe Letters. It is probable he had them from
the Poſterity of ſome of Card. <hi>Granvill</hi>'s Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
to whom he had truſted the keeping of them,
and with whom he had left them when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> It ſeems he bought
them from them, but under abſolute Engagements
not to publiſh them during their Lives. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was a moſt zealous Proteſtant, which he has
derived to all that have deſcended from him; and
he came into <hi>England</hi> from his Foreign Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
about the time that Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hiſtory
of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was firſt printed in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
That was the moſt proper time for publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe Letters, and muſt have eſtabliſhed the
Credit of the Celebrated Hiſtory, beyond all At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
to detract from it. There is no Memorial
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57465:43"/>
left in his Family of the Reaſons why he did not
then publiſh them: yet ſince I underſtand from
one, on whom I can well depend, who has read
the Regiſter of all his Letters during his Miniſtry,
that he was full of hearty Zeal for the Proteſtant
Religion, which appears in every Letter, and in
all the Advertiſements and Advices offered by
him, there muſt have been ſome very important
Reaſon that reſtrained a Man ſo full of Zeal for
that Cauſe, from publiſhing theſe Papers in the
propereſt and fitteſt time in which ever they
could have appeared. It may be ſuppoſed, that
whoſoever gave them to that worthy Miniſter,
took great care to have it concealed: For the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſuch things in the Hands of one whom the
Court at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> eſteemed a Heretick, and which
muſt have given ſuch a Wound to an Intereſt to
which thoſe Princes were ſo much devoted, muſt
have paſt for an impardonable Crime; and in a
ſevere Government this muſt have ruined thoſe
who were ſuſpected of having done it. And ſince
it might have been poſſible to have traced back a
thing that was but threeſcore Years paſt, it might
have been found out who could have had theſe
Papers in their keeping, and by conſequence have
given them to the Envoy of <hi>England.</hi> It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reaſonable to believe, that whoſoever deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoſe to him, had a Promiſe of abſolute Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
during their Lives: And this ſeems to be the
Reaſon why ſo zealous a Man uſed ſo great a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in ſo important a Matter. Since that time
the want of practice in <hi>Caſtilian</hi> has made them
leſs read; and there are ſo few of the mechanical
People of this Nation who underſtand that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
that I had no encouragement to print them
in their Original Language. I neither could fall
on one to copy them, nor hear of a Printer who
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57465:44"/>
could compoſe, or a Corrector of the Preſs to
whom I could truſt that piece of neceſſary Labour.
Therefore tho I know it is a prepoſterous thing
to publiſh a Tranſlation before the Originals
themſelves are printed; yet ſince a Spaniſh Book
could have no great vent in this Kingdom, and I
could not contrive a way how to make the correct
printing it practicable, I do now publiſh theſe,
not doubting but they will be ſpeedily printed
beyond Sea in their Original Language: for I
have, according to the Order I received from
that moſt Learned Prelat from whom I had them,
returned them back to the Noble Owner of them,
who will no doubt preſerve them with care, and
ſhew them to ſuch curious Perſons as may deſire to
ſee them; and who I hear is putting the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, as well as the tranſlating them, into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Language, into a very good Method, as
well as unto good Hands; which is ſutable to the
great Zeal he expreſſes for the promoting of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in which he is ſuch a Maſter, as well as a
Patron, and to his Affection to the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
of which he has given ſo many eminent
Inſtances.</p>

he threatens to leave <hi>Trent;</hi> accuſeth the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of not being ſo good as his Word; yields at laſt
to the Suſpenſion of ſome Doctrines. The Pope and
his Miniſters abhor and dread nothing ſo much, as
the coming of the Proteſtants to the Council: They
ſeek to abuſe the World, by pretending they would
gladly have the Proteſtants come, when at the ſame
time they are contriving all the Ways they can to
hinder them. The Embaſſadors of the King of the
Romans voted, that the Cup in the Sacrament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the People by Divine Right. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of <hi>Trent</hi> voted, that it ought to be allowed to
the Germans. The Council enjoys no manner of
Liberty. An Anſwer is return'd to the French
King's Proteſtation. The Legat ſtopt the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador's
Mouth, when he was urging him to give way
to a Reformation; with mention of a Letter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Emperor had promiſed the Pope, before the
Council met, that nothing ſhould be done in it, but
what his Holineſs would have done. <hi>Vargas</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57465:45"/>
the Promiſe ſo as to make it no Bar to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's

Fury. <hi>Page 1, 8.</hi>

The Anſwer to the French Proteſtation, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Envoys of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi>
were read therein. The Article <hi>ſub utraque</hi> was
ſuſpended. The Envoys of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> made a
pious and learned Speech, and ſubmitted themſelves
to the Council. The Legat endeavours to hinder the
Proteſtants from coming to the Council, by refuſing
them a ſafe Conduct. The Biſhops are never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
by the Legat with any thing, till it is ready
to be pronounced. Things are paſs'd hand over
head. The Biſhops made the Pope's Tools to confirm
his Pretenſions, in a Clauſe in the Anſwer to the
French Proteſtation; and not being aware of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
all the French and Spaniſh Pragmaticks.

but what the Pope orders; which is ſo viſible, that
the Proteſtants cannot but be hardened by it. The
Pope preſuming on the Emperor's Friendſhip, acts
unaccountably in the Council. The Legat pumps a
Memorial out of the Biſhops, and ſendeth it to

ſo timorouſly; he treats the Biſhops like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

from the Council, but what would prejudice
the Church, and advance the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57465:46"/>
Legat endeavours by a Trick to ſettle the Buſineſs
of Benefices, in caſe they ſhall be lodged in the
Biſhops. Care muſt be taken that the Good of the
People, and not only the Profit of the Biſhops may be
conſidered in the collation of them. <hi>Vargas</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
having any thing handled in the Council,
where the Legat does what he will, and the Pope has
any Intereſt. Nothing but Miſchief can be expected
from General Councils, while they are thus under
Bondage. If ever the Church is reformed, it muſt
be done by National Councils. The Legat to prevent
the Churches being ever reformed, is for having it
declared <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful for National Councils to meet
without the Pope's Conſent, and Legats in them.
No hopes of any Remedy from the Council. The

having all the Eccleſiaſtical Legiſlative Power lodged

The very Being of a General Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſists
in enjoying an entire Liberty. General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
are upon expiring, if not already expired. No

but what was ordered at <hi>Rome;</hi> the Pope's Penſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries

in Bondage. The Legat would have the <hi>Trent</hi>
Synod governed after the Pattern of the <hi>Lateran</hi>
under <hi>Leo</hi> the 10th, and would not ſuffer it to have
the Title of <hi>Eccleſiam Univerſalem repraeſentans,</hi>
but inſtead thereof had added <hi>Proponentibus Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
which was a new thing; he added likewiſe to

He votes himſelf very irregularly; he hectors and

them. <hi>Vargas</hi> wonders with what Face or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
the Legat could uſe the words, <hi>Dicant Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres
libere.</hi> Matters of Doctrine were determined
without a due diſcuſſion. <hi>Diego de Mendoza,</hi> the
Emperor's Embaſſador, upon the Doctrine of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
having been publiſhed in a hurry, deſires the
Legats to conſult ſome of the moſt famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
about Doctrines before they determined them;
which the Legats would not conſent to. He alſo
complained that the Council enjoy'd no Liberty, and
threatned the Legats with more German and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Biſhops. The Legats, after the Decrees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Original Sin had paſſed, read the Pope's
Brief to confirm them. Nothing done in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
but what was ordered at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Legats
having pump'd the Biſhops, diſpatched their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to <hi>Rome.</hi> They ſeek to confirm Abuſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of reforming them. The World would have
reaſon to thank the Legats, if they did not do all
poſſible Miſchief to the Church, ſince they did what
they would at <hi>Trent.</hi> They were always ſure of
the major Vote, by reaſon of their great number
of Penſionaries. All the Officers of the Council
were the Pope's Creatures, and had been named by
him. <hi>Vargas</hi> fears the <hi>Trent</hi> Council will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of doing any Good, do a great deal of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and thinks it would be better to wait God's
leiſure for reforming the Church, than to have a
Council meet; which, as the Pope had ordered things,
were able to do nothing towards it. The <hi>Trent</hi>
                           <pb n="95" facs="tcp:57465:50"/>
Council had no effect, but to mortify Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
and to make ſport for Proteſtants, and to
deſtroy the Authority of all future General Councils.
<hi>Julius</hi>'s Deſign in ſending but one Legat and two
Preſidents to <hi>Trent,</hi> was to make his Authority the
more Monarchical.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor is bound, as the Protector of the Church,
to ſee that the Council enjoy an entire Liberty: His
Embaſſadors at the Council are to ſee that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
do not vote raſhly, and that there be but one
Claſſis. The Embaſſadors muſt be preſent at all the
Aſſemblies. It is well if among a hundred Biſhops,
there are twenty that underſtand any thing of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
The moſt famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities ought to be
conſulted about Doctrines that are to be determined.
Votes ought to be weighed rather than numbred. The
Embaſſadors muſt not ſuffer Doctrines which are
<hi>praeter Fidem,</hi> to be determined. The Council
being wholly at <hi>Rome,</hi> and only the execution
of it at <hi>Trent,</hi> the Emperor's Embaſſadors at
thoſe two Places muſt hold a conſtant Correſpondence.
Since the Pope's Legats have always a Brief in their
Pockets to ſuſpend or tranſlate the Council, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they ſhall judg it convenient, the Embaſſadors
ought likewiſe to have their Inſtructions what to do in
ſuch a caſe.</p>

               <head>Dr. Vargas's Letter of <date>the 7th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
1551,</date> to the Biſhop of Arras.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>Moſt Illuſtrious and Reverend Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Write this, knowing how deſirous your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is to be acquainted with all that is done
here, and that I may have the leſs to write
hereafter.</p>
               <p>Having receiv'd his Majeſty's and your Lordſhip's
Diſpatches, which, coming thorough your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
hands, were as full and well order'd as we
could have wiſhed them, I went immediately to
ſpeak with the Legate. The Concluſion we came to,
and which was paſs'd yeſterday in the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
(for ſuch I ſuppoſe it will be pronounced
to have been at the Seſſion) was, that the Article,
<hi>ſub utraque,</hi> with all its dependencies, ſhould be
ſuſpended until the ſecond Seſſion after this that is
now to be celebrated; the Firſt being to be held after
forty Days, and the Second on the 25th of <hi>Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57465:58"/>
neither was it an eaſie thing for to obtain thoſe
few Days. It would ask much time, to relate all
that has paſs'd in this Affair, and the difficulties
that were ſtarted about it. The Legate was like a
diſtracted man, and being tranſported beyond all
the bounds of negotiating, among other things he
threatned to be gone immediately, not being able to
endure to ſee the Council thus affronted, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
matters, after they were handled, and ready to
be determined, ſuſpended thus. He told us farther,
that this was done for no other end but to delay
buſineſs, for that otherwiſe, the Council ought to
have been adviſed thereof before it had proceeded
ſo far; concluding, that this did not at all agree with
what his Majeſty had writ, before he came to <hi>Trent,</hi>
with a great deal more ſuch ſtuff; to all which, tho'
I returned him ſatisfactory anſwers, which I need
not repeat here, there was no reducing him to
Reaſon.</p>
               <p>This Diſpute having laſted three Days, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
condeſcended at laſt to what is above-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and tho' we ſtruggled hard not to have had the
term fixed, but to have had that left to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
we were not able to obtain that of him. In
fine, that we might not come to an open rupture
with him, which we were very near doing, we were
forc'd to accept of what is granted, hoping that it
may be ſufficient time for the Proteſtants to come in,
and for his Majeſty, if he ſhould judge it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
for to treat with the Pope, either to prolong
it, or to give ſome orders about it.</p>
               <p>Not doubting of the Legate's having us'd very
brutal methods, that being a thing he knows full well
how to do, whenever he judgeth it to be neceſſary, I
was always of the mind that we ought to ſtand our
ground, to ſee whether he would offer any thing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57465:58"/>
that was to the purpoſe; but perceiving, that this
matter went to his very Soul, and fearing leſt we
might thereby hazard the whole buſineſs, we were
glad to agree to what is done, which I take not to
be much amiſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> who takes a great deal of pains,
managed this Affair with his cuſtomary Prudence;
the granting of a ſafe Conduct is likewiſe agreed to,
notwithſtanding there were ſeveral that oppos'd it;
nevertheleſs, fearing what might happen, it was
thought convenient that <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> ſhould ſpeak
to all our Prelates, before the General Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
met yeſterday: We ſhall do all we can to have it
diſpatch'd according to his Majeſty's Directions, as
it is fit it ſhould.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip may be ſatisfy'd of what I know
to be true, and have writ formerly, which is, that
there is nothing in the World the Pope and his
Miniſters abhor and dread ſo much, as the coming
of the Proteſtants to the Council; for we can plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceive that they are not themſelves, nor in a
condition to treat about any Buſineſs, when they
are brought to touch on that Point. This is the
true reaſon of their making ſo much haſte, and of
their having been ſo unwilling to grant what is above-mentioned,
being in continual dread leaſt ſomething
ſhould riſe from under their Feet to diſturb them,
and of Peoples coming hither, who may, to their
great mortification, deliver their Minds freely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Abuſes, and ſome other things.</p>
               <p>So that in truth it is their whole buſineſs to abuſe
the World, by pretending that they do hope, and wiſh
that the Proteſtants would come, when at the ſame
time they are contriving all the ways they can think of
to ſhut the Door againſt them: This, ſo far as I can
underſtand, was the reaſon likewiſe of precipitating the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57465:59"/>
                  <hi>Doctrine of Juſtification,</hi> as they did: and whereas
they cannot tell but that the Proteſtants may come
hither, ſo were they but certain, that they would
never come, I cannot tell what they might do.</p>
               <p>As to your Lordſhip's wondring at the Electors
not having obſerv'd this, and at their having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
things to go ſo far; to ſpeak the truth, it is
what I have likewiſe wonder'd at, and the more,
ſince I was told, that the Embaſſadours of the King
of the <hi>Romans</hi> had voted the Communicating under
both Species to be of Divine Right, and that the
Cardinal of <hi>Trent</hi> gave a great many Reaſons, why
the <hi>Germans</hi> ought to be diſpenſed with therein:
As to the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> to whom he of <hi>Triers</hi>
is intirely reſign'd, he was of another mind, having
declared that it would be no advantage to grant
that to them, for which he is highly extoll'd by the
Pope's Miniſters and others, as he of <hi>Trent</hi> is
ſtrangely run down for what he ſaid, by ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
they have ſpread abroad of him.</p>
               <p>For among the other Non-Liberties of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
this is one, That whoever offers any thing that
is not grateful to the Legate, or that does not ſuit
exactly with ſome People's Prepoſſeſſions, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have ſpoke ill, and to think worſe, and
to have taken what he ſaid out of I do not know
whom. And thus moſt things are handled here with
great prejudices. <hi>Mentz</hi> follows the Legate in every
thing almoſt which is much for his honour, and
for <hi>Triers</hi> he votes always as <hi>Mentz</hi> does.</p>
               <p>As to my ſelf, I can ſay it, that before I knew
any thing of the Proteſtants being to come hither, I
was ſtill of the Opinion, that at leaſt the two Articles
of the Communion, and the Marriage of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
ought to be deferr'd; as your Lordſhip may ſee
in the laſt Letter I wrote to you in haſte of the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57465:59"/>
Inſtant; could I but have timely notice of things, I
ſhould be able to do your Lordſhip more ſervice,
for which, till that is done, I muſt be excus'd:
But as I have declared that to be my Opinion, ſo I
do remember, that having once ſpoke thereof to the
Biſhop of <hi>Verdun</hi> at a Congregation, the ſaid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
approv'd of it, as did alſo the Count <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
when I communicated it to him, and who I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſpoke of it to <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> who thereupon
writ about it, and by that means it came into his
Majeſty's Diſpatch, where I was glad to ſee it, as I
was alſo to ſee it in your Lordſhip's Letter. I ſhall,
in obedience to your Lordſhip, take all the care I
can to prevent irregular proceedings here; for there
are ſeveral matters which the Legate ought to treat
with more Deliberation, than he has hitherto hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
things; <hi>I pray God give them Grace to underſtand
this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Should the Proteſtants come hither, they will
expect, I ſuppoſe, to be heard as to the Matters
which are already determined, no leſs than to thoſe
that are not, as indeed it is but reaſonable they
ſhould; and the rather, that we may thereby incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them to come: Now as they will chooſe ſome
to ſpeak in their name, ſo it will be convenient, in
my mind, that the Catholicks ſhould appoint ſome
to anſwer them, and that they may ſatisfie them
without wrangling, let them have their ſeveral Days
allotted, but ſo that the Proteſtants may ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
Plaintiffs.</p>
               <p>I take notice of this, becauſe there are ſome here,
who are obſtinately of Opinion, that none but the
Proteſtants are to be ſuffered to ſpeak to Matters
which are already decided, and that they are only to
be heard. Now if this courſe is taken, as it will
give but little ſatisfaction, ſo it will not be much for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57465:60"/>
the Honour of the Synod, for there is the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for anſwering them, as there is for hearing
them; and does not their ſaying that the Proteſtants
ſhall be heard in Matters which are already determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
only in order to their being inſtructed, and
their diſputing here about things as if the Proteſtants
were preſent, demonſtrate that this courſe ought
to be taken; for ſince moſt of the things have been
determined by former Councils, were it not on ſuch
an occaſion as this, it would not be lawful for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks
to diſpute about them; ſo that if this courſe
is not take the Proteſtants will come hither to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
purpoſe, neither can they properly be ſaid to
come to a Council, but to be brought before a Court.
There is one thing that ought to be well conſider'd
of, which is, whether it will not be convenient,
when the Proteſtants are come, not to have the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ſo thick, leſt by determining of things wherein
they are concerned, they may be provok'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
out of deſpair of not being able to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing: And whether it will not therefore be the
beſt way to hear both them and the Catholicks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the Points in Controverſie between them, and
after that is done, to have all determined in one
Seſſion, as was done in the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi>
with the Hereſies of <hi>Wickliff;</hi> which courſe, as it
will make things ſeem to be maturely conſidered and
digeſted before they are decreed; ſo it will prevent
ſuch miſcarriages as have been committed in ſome
Matters.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip may be pleaſed to conſider what is
fit to be done in this, and all other Points, for
what-ever you ſhall judge to be moſt convenient will
certainly be ſo. I have not neglected to ſpeak of this
where-ever it was proper to do it; and as I have met
with ſeveral that do approve of it, ſo it appears to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57465:60"/>
me to be a very conſiderable thing, and which may
be of ſome advantage to us, in order to defeat the
Legate's Deſigns about the preſent Suſpenſion, which
was the cauſe of my mentioning it at this time.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>French</hi> King's Proteſtation, there will
no Decree be pronounc'd upon it, but the Anſwer
they have ſent to the Legate from <hi>Rome</hi> will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to it, which I am told is very well framed,
and is agreeable enough to what his Majeſty has writ
concerning it, being a mean betwixt pronouncing a
Decree, and being ſilent, tho' in effect it is much
the ſame with a Decree; the Synods having thereon
declared it ſelf to be univerſal, which, to prevent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking,
was in my Opinion convenient enough. I
am confident, had we ſollicited to have had a Decree,
that was ſubſtantial but not rigorous, that we ſhould
never have been able to have obtain'd it, nor to have
ſettled the point with the Pope and his Miniſters,
the Legate having been order'd, ſome Days agoe, not
to give us any Anſwer about it; and the Anſwer
which is ſaid to have been here four Days, was yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
read and approved of in the Congregation</p>
               <p>As to the Proviſions they are here very buſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them; I have formerly writ ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, and we ſhall now ſee quickly what will
be done therein; the Wheat is come already, which
has not been ſo dear here of late, as it was laſt Year,
when I wrote to his Majeſty and your Lordſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it. That of the Guard is a good thing, and
<hi>Don Franciſco</hi> will write how well it is taken here:
It was a good Bargain your Lordſhip made with the
King of the <hi>Romans</hi> about Fleſh, it being in that
and Bread they exact the moſt, and whereof I was
the moſt apprehenſive. <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> takes care of
this as he does of every thing elſe, in which I give
him all the aſſiſtance I am able, which is ſomething
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57465:61"/>
the greater by my being ſo much in my Lord Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's
favour; <hi>I pray God it may ſucceed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip does by your daily Favours and
Kindneſſes, and by the particular care you take of
my Perſon and Advancement, run me ſo deep into
your debt that I can only ſay, that I do kiſs your
Lordſhip's Hands a thouſand times for it, and do
wiſh to live, that I may by my Services diſcharge
the Debt in part I am owing to your Lordſhip,
whoſe I am, and will be all the days of my life;
ſo that your Lordſhip, in taking care of my Concerns,
takes care of your own. As to the ſucceſs, let God
do what he ſhall judge to be moſt convenient, and if
I do not proſper, let my own ill fortune, or want of
Merits, and not your Lordſhip be blamed for it,
from whom I have already receiv'd that Kindneſs,
whoſe moſt Illuſtrious and Reverend Perſon and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
may our Lord preſerve and proſper for many
Years, as I deſire.</p>

               <head>The following Paper is a Note writ with
Vargas's own Hand, but without his
Name or any Date to it.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>DON Franciſco,</hi> I believe, muſt have writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Copy of a Letter wherewith the
Legate endeavour'd with great ſecreſie to have
ſtopp'd his Mouth when he was urging him to
give way to a Reformation; in which Letter, if
it is true, his Majeſty did aſſure the Pope, That
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57465:61"/>
nothing ſhould be done in the Council but what
he had a mind to have done in it, and that he
would oblige the Prelates to hold their Tongues,
and to let things paſs without any oppoſition.
<hi>Don Franciſco</hi> being aſtoniſhed at this, acquainted
me therewith in great Anxiety; I immediately told
him, that I queſtioned whether what the Legate had
ſaid was true or not: but ſuppoſing it were, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
nothing, ſince it was not to be literally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
as the Legate, who made a great Secret of it,
pretended; that Letter having been writ by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
before the Pope had granted his Bull for the
continuation of the Council, when it was writ on
purpoſe, to bring the Pope for to grant it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of exaſperating him, to ſatisfie him with good
words, that he ſhould run no risk thereby: which
his Majeſty continues ſtill to do, the times being
ſuch as will not ſuffer him to act otherwiſe with
him: not that ever his Majeſty intended thereby
that the Pope ſhould be ſuffered to do ſuch things,
as would bring all to ruine, but only to do ſuch
things as are reaſonable, in leaving, as there ſhould
be occaſion, the Reformation of Matters to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.
Now provided the Pope would do nothing
but what is convenient, notwithſtanding he knows
full-well how to do other ſort of things, and which
are no ways profitable, his Majeſty might very ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offer and promiſe what he does in that Letter,
which is undoubtedly to be underſtood with that
condition; ſince neither could his Majeſty have any
other meaning therein, nor could the Pope, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
forgetting himſelf, deſire any thing more of him.
What I then ſaid, I ſay now again, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubting of its truth in the leaſt: tho', at the
ſame time, I do heartily wiſh, that the Pope may
neither by this, nor by any other way have any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57465:62"/>
given him of taking more liberty in ſuch
matters than he already uſeth, <hi>Quae proculdubio ad
mentis aegrotationem &amp; animi morbum uſque pervenit,
ita ut non niſi inſania &amp; furor quidem appellanda ſit:</hi>
I do ſuppoſe the Legat likewiſe preſumes much
upon this Letter. I do leave it to your Lordſhip,
whether there be any thing in this, wherewith I
ought to be acquainted.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Promiſe of the Emperor's, That if the
Pope would re-aſſemble the Council, he would
ſuffer nothing to be done in it, but what the
Pope would have done, notwithſtanding all that
<hi>Vargas</hi> has here offered in its Juſtification, does
very much reflect both on the Emperor and the
Pope: On the Emperor, becauſe at the ſame
time he made the Pope this promiſe, he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> a free
General Council; and on the Pope, for requiring
ſuch an unreaſonable promiſe before he would
venture to re-aſſemble the Synod; ſo that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Emperor kept his word with the Pope
or not; it is certain, the Pope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he called
the Council in expectation that he would have
done it, never intended, notwithſtanding all his
and his Legate's Godly profeſſions to the contrary,
that the Council ſhould injoy any thing of liberty
or authority.</q>

               <p>AS I was going on <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning to the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
your Lordſhips of the 8th Current came
to my hand, with which I received the favour that
is cuſtomary; the Seſſion was celebrated with greater
Solemnity than any other Seſſion from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Council had been; the Offices being
long, it laſted eight hours, the reſt of the time was
ſpent in an Oration, ſpoke by the Archbiſhop of
<hi>Sazar,</hi> which was a very good one, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
the Decrees, and in reading the Anſwer
to the Proteſtation, and the Suſpenſion of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<hi>ſub utraque,</hi> with all its dependencies, and the
Powers of the Electoral Marquiſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi>
and in hearing an Oration ſpoke by the Chief of his
Envoys; which Oration was both pious and learned,
the Envoy having declared therein, that his Maſter
did, by vertue of the Powers he had exhibited, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himſelf to the Council; the Powers, as well as
the Speech, were elegantly worded; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he did not ſpecifie wherein he was willing
to ſubmit himſelf to the Council; yet in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to accept of all that his ſaid Envoys ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to, and approve of, they were received with
Congratulations; which has ſo far removed a doubt
we had, that matters are like to go on better than
we expected: Nevertheleſs, in caſe there ſhould be
a change, what his Majeſty has commanded, and
your Lordſhip writ to me about, is well ordered.
I here ſend your Lordſhip a Copy of the Acts, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
I know they are ſent by <hi>Don Franciſco</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57465:63"/>
to his Majeſty. I have nothing to add, to what I
writ to your Lordſhip on the 7th Inſtant, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what has paſſed ſince, only that things have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
out as I ſaid they would; two or three of which
I would not have had done, and which, I think,
ought ſtill for to be remedy'd.</p>
               <p>The firſt relates to the buſineſs of the ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
for ſeeing they are willing to grant one, as
it is but juſt they ſhould, I could wiſh it were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
fuller, and as near to that which was granted
to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> as the times will permit: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch a one that the Proteſtants deſire, and as
muſt deprive them of all excuſes for not coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Such a one would likewiſe be agreeable to
that of his Majeſty's, which, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> is the
ſame with that of <hi>Baſil;</hi> that Clauſe only being left
out, which gave the <hi>Bohemians</hi> leave to Celebrate
their Religious Offices <hi>in locis hoſpitiorum ſuorum, &amp;c.</hi>
And the following Words, <hi>Sic tandem ut ab eadem
Synodo occaſione quorumcunque exceſſuum aut delicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
ab eis antea ſive modo veniendo, manendo aut re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deundo
commiſſorum aut committendorum minime pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niantur,</hi>
being put before the Clauſe, <hi>Si quiſpiam, &amp;c.</hi>
which, in truth, is no more than is neceſſary to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them from being puniſhed for their Hereſies:
Neither does it amount to a Permiſſion, but only
a Toleration; ſo that they ſhall not be puniſhed
for any Crime, but by Judges, appointed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themſelves, which is granted in the Clauſe,
<hi>Si quiſpiam, &amp;c.</hi> in the ſafe Conduct of <hi>Baſil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſafe Conduct having been thus ordered, was
ſent by <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> to the Legate, who, as your
Lordſhip will ſee, has changed the whole form there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
having reduced it to a very ſmall compaſs, which
cannot but give great offence to the Proteſtants, who
therein have no promiſe made them, not to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57465:63"/>
for the offences of their Religion, which for
the removing of Scruples ought to have been
done; and the rather, becauſe they are not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Exerciſe of their Worſhip; it ſeems likewiſe
to give the Judges, that are to be appointed over
them a Power of taking cognizance of all Crimes
they have committed or ſhall commit, even ſavouring
of Hereſie: Neither is it ſaid that the Judges ſhall
be appointed from among themſelves but only in
general, <hi>Quod poſſint deligere Judices ſibi benevolos,</hi>
which may very well raiſe ſuch ſcruples in them as
may hinder them from ever coming hither, ſince
they will never conſent, that they ſhall be liable to
puniſhments, by any Judges purely on the account
of their Religion; neither will they fail to ſay,
that this was done with a deſign.</p>
               <p>The Clauſe likewiſe, <hi>quantum ad ipſam ſanctam
Synodum ſpectat,</hi> may very well make them jealous,
ſince the Synod ought to promiſe for the Pope the
Emperour and all other Princes and Prelates, that
they ſhall injoy an intire ſecurity, as was done by
the Synod of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and eſpecially ſince they have
promiſed his Majeſty ſo to do: they ought likewiſe
to ſuſpend the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
made in its 9th Seſſion; and that of <hi>Sienna,</hi> as was
done in the ſafe Conduct that was granted to the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians,</hi>
that being a thing the Proteſtants have
much in their thoughts, and who, by their inſiſting
thereon, have much retarded his Majeſty: and the
truth is, the Synod in a caſe of this importance
ought not to grudge them words, but ought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
deſcending to niceties, or to what is enough, or
not enough, for to grant them an entire ſecurity:
All which things ought, in my judgment, for to be
remedy'd, and ſo they ſhall, if the Legate will, as
he ought to do, let me ſee the ſafe Conduct before
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57465:64"/>
it is pronounced. But as I have formerly writ your
Lordſhip, conſidering that he grants this with a
very ill will, I do not at all wonder at his acting
therein as he does, and at his contriving a thouſand
ways for to hinder thoſe people from ever coming
to the Council.</p>
               <p>As to the Prelates, where is no need of taking
any notice of them, they being no ways concerned
in that matter, the Legate having never ſo much as
acquainted them with it, all things appearing well
to them at firſt ſight, and who knowing nothing
of matters untill they are juſt ready to be pronounced,
paſs them without any more ado.</p>
               <p>On which occaſion I told <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> before
Dr. <hi>Malvenda,</hi> who is an honeſt, learned and judicious
Man, that ſince the Legate had promiſed, that if
his Majeſty was not ſatisfy'd with this, he would
grant ſuch a ſafe Conduct as he ſhould deſire, it was
fit it ſhould be done, tho' it would have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that it had been done already without ſuch a
great expence of time, and ſpinning out of buſineſs
by delays. Your Lordſhip may be pleaſed to take
this matter into your care; and as it will be well if
the Proteſtants will be ſatisfy'd with what is already
done, ſo it is expedient to try preſently whether
they will or not, that if they ſhould not, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
may return the ſafe Conduct as he would have
it: I pray God they may here comply with that
freedom they have ſaid they will: I have been the
longer upon this, becauſe it appears to me to be an
affair of great moment.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing wherewith I am diſpleaſed, is
in the anſwer that was given to the Proteſtation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at <hi>Quod vero teſtatur;</hi> in which the Pope,
for his own ends, has made the Council a party in
the authorizing of his affairs, and in defending of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57465:64"/>
his pretenſions againſt all the Pragmaticks, which
have been, or may be made in <hi>France</hi> concerning
Benefices, and other ſuch matters? this the Council
ought by no means to have been brought to have
done, for beſides what his Majeſty has writ hither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſuch points, the Pragmaticks of <hi>France</hi> about
which there have been ſuch great debates, are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they are too little acquainted with, to take
upon them to approve or diſprove, or pronounce
any thing againſt them Synodically; it being neither
convenient nor juſt, that the Synod, which knows
nothing of thoſe affairs, having never examined them
nor brought them into judgment, ſhould, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over-head,
pronounce any thing about them. This
is a matter that will in all likelyhood irritate
the <hi>French,</hi> to write againſt a Clauſe thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by the Synod by the Pope's managery:
For whatever ſome may think, the Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
of <hi>France</hi> was not intirely abrogated in the
laſt <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, the Concordate which was
pronounced in the ſame Seſſion, having been granted
in lieu of it, and after ſuch a manner that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
did not amount to an abſolute Abrogation,
neither was what was done in that Council about this
affair ever agreed to by the <hi>French,</hi> any otherwiſe
than as it was a confirmation of their Pragmatick, of
which I ſhall ſay no more, but that it was founded
on the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which is ſtill received and
defended as authentick by the whole Kingdom of
<hi>France,</hi> and the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and that it
depends likewiſe on the firſt Pragmatick made by
St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farthermore this is a thing that in my opinion
is very prejudicial to his Majeſty's Pragmaticks,
and to thoſe eſpecially which were made lately at
<hi>Madrid,</hi> againſt Strangers having any Benefices,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57465:65"/>
and about ſeveral other matters, all which, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the preſent neceſſities, were juſtly and piouſly
framed: but they who were not at all pleaſed with
thoſe Pragmaticks, have, by bringing the Council
to condemn thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> given a blow to thoſe
of <hi>Spain</hi> likewiſe, by reaſon of the great affinity
there is betwixt them; tho' of the two thoſe of
<hi>Spain</hi> may be the moſt righteous.</p>
               <p>But tho' now it is pronounced, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for it, nevertheleſs I am willing to let your
Lordſhip ſee how things are carried here, and what
the Pope's aims are, who ſeeks to authorize all his
own pretenſions by the Council, and of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it is I ſhould ſpeak of things before-hand, in
order to make them to be underſtood, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
as I have obſerved formerly, unleſs they are
told of things, and that not ſuperficially, and as
they have hitherto been advertized of them, will
never examine them ſo as to fall into the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of them. In fine, this will not be the laſt
thing we ſhall have to warn us of the neceſſity there
is thereof; there are ſeveral other things I am not
at all ſatisfied with, which were carried here with
the ſame ſlight Pope <hi>Paul</hi> made uſe of in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
he gave to <hi>Don Diego de Mendoça,</hi> and in all
probability by the ſame hand: <hi>And is not this a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
beginning of a Council?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. There is a thing I would gladly have had done
which was that one or more of the Articles they
have pronounced had been ſuſpended with the reſt,
but there is no remedy for that now, and ſo it is to
no purpoſe to complain of it.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>the Canons of Reformation,</hi> I have nothing
to ſay of them, but only that they are of <hi>ſo trivial
a nature,</hi> that ſeveral were aſhamed to hear them;
and had they not been wrapped up in good language,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57465:65"/>
they would have appeared to the whole World to
be what they are; and if God does not prevent it,
I do not ſee but that all other things will be carried
here at the ſame rate; <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> has ſhewed me
what his Majeſty has wrote to him about this affair:
which he had done ſooner, had he not been hindred
by extraordinary buſineſs. I can only ſay that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have gone therein to a tittle as I writ to your
Lorſhip they would: As to what your Lordſhip
writes, about its being convenient, ſince the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
are to come, not to have the Seſſions ſo thick,
and to have all the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Articles determined
together; it's a thing that appears to me, every day
more conſiderable, being furniſhed with arguments
to anſwer all they are able to object againſt it. Some
days ago I told Dr. <hi>Malvenda</hi> as much, who was
very well pleaſed with it; telling me, that he had
thought of it ſeveral times, and I was juſt now told
by him that he had ſpoke of it to the Elector of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi>
who liked it very well, and has writ to your
Lordſhip about it; it is an affair that deſerves to be
well conſidered, and being judged by all to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
the Pope muſt be treated with about it, in
time; neither will the obſervation thereof be any
innovation in the courſe of proceedings, but only
an inlargement of the Seſſion, ſo as to provide for
what may happen, that when the Proteſtants do
come, matters may be ſo ordered as ſhall be found
proper both for their remedy and the authority of
the Synod. I am extreamly glad to hear that his
Majeſty is coming nigher to us; for beſides, that it
will be no ſmall ſatisfaction to me to have your
Lordſhip ſo near; his Majeſty's Preſence may give
ſome life to affairs here. <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> who is a
Perſon of great judgment, prudence and dexterity,
manageth things very well, and has been at a great
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57465:66"/>
deal of pains to obtain this Seſſion. I muſt beg it
of your Lordſhip to acquaint him with this account
I give of him, that ſo he may be ſenſible how much
I am his friend both in private and publick.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Sazar</hi> takes a great deal of
pains too, and is a very good inſtrument in all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
that happen betwixt the Embaſſadors, and
the Legate, and Preſidents, and is beſides very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in the Synod at the Deputations; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it but juſt that your Lordſhip ſhould ſhew him
favour, and do him all the good Offices you are able.
<hi>Don Franciſco</hi> has, I believe, writ particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this; and if your Lordſhip has, with my
Letters, received the Sermon, it is in ſending it, that
I have done him the greateſt ſervice.</p>
               <p>I kiſs your Lordſhip's hands a thouſand times, for
the favours and kindneſſes you are always doing me;
in return for which, I can only repeat what I have
often ſaid, That I deſire to live only to ſerve your
Lordſhip, and to pay part of what I owe you.
May our Lord preſerve and proſper your moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Perſon and State for many years, as I deſire.</p>

in the Seſſion, I ſhall only tell you that it was

managed all things with his cuſtomary prudence

we have another Seſſion, it is neceſſary that any
thing that his Majeſty would have done therein,
ſhould be prepared.</p>
               <p>They are at preſent employ'd here in hearing the
Divines every morning and evening upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Penance and Extream Unction: They are
a great many, and ſeveral of them very Eminent,
but chiefly thoſe who were ſent from all Parts by
his Majeſty, who in the Diſputations have ſhewed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57465:67"/>
themſelves to be great Men. I was over-joy'd at
Dr. <hi>Malvenda</hi>'s acquitting himſelf ſo well, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
both learnedly and elegantly, and to the
great ſatisfaction of all that heard him.</p>
               <p>They of <hi>Lovain</hi> appear to be great Scholars; and
for the Dean, he is certainly a wonderfull Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as Reverend for his Learning, as he is for his
Perſon; who, as he is the Father of all the reſt, ſo
the Greatneſs of his Worth is ſo conſpicuous, that
his Majeſty cannot do leſs than order him to have
the firſt place, next after the Pope's Divines, allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the ſecond place to Dr. <hi>Malvenda;</hi> and for the
reſt, the ranking of them may be left to <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco:</hi>
They have all ſatisfy'd the World of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
having made a judicious Choice in ſending
ſuch Perſons: And for Friar <hi>Melchior Canus,</hi> he is
a Perſon of ſo great Learning, Piety and Prudence,
that ſhould the Proteſtants come hither, as it is ſaid
they intend, they will meet with that in him that
will ſatisfie them.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Trent</hi> is informed by a Letter he
has received from Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> that there are
forty Horſe-men on their way hither, among whom
are eight Divines, and two Lawyers, beſides two
from the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg;</hi> and that they may
be here in five or ſix Days, this News does not a
little alarm ſome that are here; and if it is true,
the Proteſtants muſt not, it ſeems, much regard the
defects that are in the ſafe Conduct. I pray God
it may be ſo; though, for my own part, for the
Reaſons I have formerly given your Lordſhip, I ſhall
never believe they will come, before I ſee them
here.</p>
               <p>When I left <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the Council thereof put a
Memorial into my hands, containing ſeveral things
they deſired to have redreſſed; which, together with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57465:68"/>
one of my own drawing up, I ſent to his Majeſty,
at my firſt coming to this place; Since which time
I have never ſpoke of it, waiting ſtill to ſee how
things would go, and what would be done to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Biſhops in the firſt Seſſion; as alſo to know
his Majeſty's pleaſure concerning it: Let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
intreat your Lordſhip to put his Majeſty in
mind of it, and to acquaint me with what he would
have done; that is, whether he would have us ſpeak,
and to what, and when, or how, or if he would have
us continue ſilent. I can aſſure your Lordſhip the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
has declared, That nothing more ſhall be done,
relating to a Reformation, after the next Seſſion;
all the time that remains being to be employ'd about
Matters of Doctrine: By this your Lordſhip may ſee,
how little <hi>Don Franciſco</hi>'s having ſpoke to him ſince
the receipt of his Majeſty's laſt Letters, ſignifies.</p>
               <p>I am extreamly ſenſible that a great many things
of a very high nature, are handled here ſo ſlightly,
and after ſuch a manner as gives great diſcontent to
People; and for to ſpeak the truth, I cannot ſee
how either Catholicks or Hereticks can be ſatisfy'd
with what is done here; and as for the latter, I
doubt they will be much exaſperated by what will
be done in the next Seſſion, in which they intend to
revive the matter of Juſtification; and when they
come to treat of Contrition and Satisfaction, for to
determine them a ſecond time.</p>
               <p>But now whereas this Council was Aſſembled
chiefly for the ſake of a particular Province, I ſhould
be glad that ſo far as it is poſſible, as things are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
the determination of this, and of ſome other
Doctrines might be ſuſpended untill the Arrival of
the Proteſtants, who are now ſaid to be on their
way. Your Lordſhip may in this and all other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
give what Orders you ſhall judge to be moſt
convenient.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:57465:68"/>
All that is done here, is done by the way of
<hi>Rome;</hi> for the Legate, though it were neceſſary to
ſave the World from ſinking, will not depart one
tittle from the Orders he receives from thence, nor
indeed from any thing that he has himſelf once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
on.</p>
               <p>He has told ſeveral, and <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> and me
among the reſt, that he will put an end to the
Council by <hi>July;</hi> and that there ſhall be but five
Seſſions more; that is, the two which are already
appointed, and three more.</p>
               <p>God is my witneſs how willing I, who have now
been here ſeven years, am to ſee it at an end, that
ſo I may return to my own corner again; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
I am ſo deſirous, to ſee ſome of thoſe fruits of
this Council which we expected, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
are ſo neceſſary, that I would be contented, if
I had ſeveral lives, to employ them all therein.</p>
               <p>I am not at all ſatisfy'd with what has been done
in reference to a Reformation, neither do I hope to
ſee much more done therein; for I can plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the Legate has the very ſame Aims and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
that the preſent Pope had, who both when
he was Legate here, and ſince he was Pope, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
on his Majeſty's friendſhip, has done things
without fear, that were really aſtoniſhing, never
doubting of his being able to carry whatever he had
a mind to. I do obſerve that the preſent Legate
diſcovers this, infinitely more than the former ever
did; he having given us to underſtand, that the
Reformation is not a thing to be dwelt on; and
that all that is to be done therein, will be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in this Seſſion, the remaining time being to be
wholly employ'd about Doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:57465:69"/>
                  <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> after he had received his Majeſty's
laſt Letter, which was ſuch as I wiſhed it, ſpoke
excellently well, and with all poſſible earneſtneſs:
The Legate's Anſwer to him was, That he would
do a great Service, if he could perſuade the Biſhops
to give in Memorials to him, of what they would
be at, and of the Impediments of Reſidence, inſtead
of deſiring things at random. <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thereupon ſpoke to ſeveral of the Prelates to
do it, they accordingly gave in their Memorials to
him; who having reduced them all into one, he
delivered it to the Legate, who ſent it to <hi>Rome</hi> to
have the Pope's thoughts of it. God knows how
much it afflicts me to ſee things done ſo openly to
the prejudice of the authority of the Synod, and of
his Majeſty's honour too; the Legate might certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if he pleaſed, do ſuch things more privately, and
leſs to the diſhonour of the Council, ſo as not to
give People, and eſpecially the Proteſtants, occaſion
to talk thereof, who, I doubt, will be much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened
by ſuch doings. I am fearfull leſt the Legate
ſhould, under a pretence of Friendſhip, impoſe on
<hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> the Legate being immovably deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
as to every thing that he will do; neither are
his Intentions in this affair the ſame with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions;
all that he driveth at in this matter, being
only to have wherewith to ſtop the mouths of the
Prelates, to keep them from ſpeaking about other
things; the bringing of the Prelates to ſpeak to the
Impediments of Epiſcopal Reſidence, having been
the artifice from the beginning: To ſpeak the
truth, <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> takes a great deal of pains, and
manages things after as good a manner as can be
imagined: we ſhall ſee how this buſineſs will end.
For my own part, I am extreamly diſcontented,
but I am not able to do more, though I know I very
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57465:69"/>
often do more than I am well able; as well in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they conſult with me about, as in other things,
I am informed of: And this I am certain your
Lordſhip believes of me. Your Lordſhip will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the whole of this Affair by <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco,</hi>
who has ſent a Copy of the Memorial he gave
in. May God direct things better than ſome would
have them, and protect and proſper your moſt Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious

years, as I deſire.</p>

                  <salute>Moſt Illuſtrious and Reverend Lord,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AS I was about to write this, your Lordſhip's of
the 10th Inſtant, which I had long wiſhed
for, came to my hand: But when I conſider the
multitude of Buſineſs your Lordſhip is involved in,
it is much rather to be wondred at, that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
Diſpatches do come ſo quick as they do, than
that they come ſo ſlow: So that all that can be ſaid
is, That we muſt have patience, and deſire his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to let us have his Anſwers for our direction here
as quick as it is poſſible, that being no more than
is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>At preſent I have little to write, in relation to
the Pope's Miniſters, in the managery of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and the buſineſs of Reformation, having already
acquainted your Lordſhip therewith; only I ſee no
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57465:70"/>
hopes of any remedy, neither am I able to divine,
where theſe matters will ſtop: I ſhall know more
when this Seſſion is over, and ſhall take care to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
your Lordſhip with all that ſhall occur.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding we have but three Days to the
Seſſion, a Reformation is no more talked of here,
than if it were a thing never to be mentioned again:
And as for the Legate, he goes on ſtill in his old
road, conſuming of time to the laſt hour in Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and Congregations, concerning Doctrines,
and will at laſt produce ſomething in an hurry in
falſe colours that looks plauſible: by which means
they have no time to read, and much leſs to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what they are about: So that it is not to be
expected that any thing that is done here ſhould
produce ought but ſcorn and confuſion.</p>
               <p>Words and Perſuaſions do ſignifie but very little
in this place, and I ſuppoſe they are not of much
greater force at <hi>Rome,</hi> thoſe People having ſhut their
eyes, with a reſolution, notwithſtanding all things
ſhould go to wrack, not to underſtand any thing
that do's not ſuit with their intereſts. So that by
what I can perceive, both God, and his Majeſty, are
like to be very much diſhonoured by what will be
done here; and if things ſhould go on thus, and be
brought to ſuch an iſſue as the Pope and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
aim at and give out, the Church will be left
in a much worſe condition, than ſhe was in before:
It will therefore be expedient, after this Seſſion is
over, and matters are become more deſperate, if
that is poſſible, than they are at preſent, to ſet about
applying ſome remedies, by taking ſome other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible of the great pains your Lordſhip is
at in doing all good Offices both at <hi>Rome,</hi> and with
the Nuncio, in order to inform the Pope aright,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57465:70"/>
and to bring him to alter his meaſures: I pray God
he may be prevailed with to do it, though, for my
own part, I ſhall reckon it a Miracle if he is, and
ſhall thank God for it as ſuch.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, I ſhall, after your Lordſhip's
Example, comfort my ſelf with the thoughts of what
God oftentimes uſeth to do, when things are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to ſuch a deſperate eſtate, that no humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is ſufficient for them; which we may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hope for in this caſe, becauſe God's Honour,
and the Reformation of the Church, are immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned in it: But after all, God only knows,
after what manner ſuch a remedy will be apply'd,
and whether by ſuch ways as we think it will, and
deſire it ſhould.</p>
               <p>As to the Proteſtants coming hither, I do not
know what to ſay to it; only if other methods are
not taken here, their coming will be to no purpoſe,
and they will return worſe than they came; and
eſpecially if they ſhould be ſuch perſons as your
Lordſhip is informed they are: God may neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
notwithſtanding all their Rebellions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations,
bring them hither, to enlighten both
themſelves and others as to their duties; for which
reaſon, as there are ſeveral that do wiſh they were
here, ſo there are others who cannot endure to hear
of their coming, and much leſs to ſee it.</p>
               <p>The two Proteſtants that are here already, do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to have no other buſineſs but to provide Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for the reſt, though I rather think they are ſent
before as Spies: The <hi>Bohemians</hi> having taken the
ſame courſe at the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> who, after a
great many Offers, would not venture to come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were adviſed by two they had ſent before,
<hi>Rem agi ſerio, nec ſubeſſe dolum:</hi> The meaning of
which may eaſily be underſtood. It is reported that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57465:71"/>
                  <hi>Melancthon</hi> and the reſt of them, appeared obſtinate
and reſolute in their Errors at the Aſſembly of <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temburg;</hi>
if that is true, there is but little hopes of
reducing them, neither will I ever believe they will
come, before I ſee them here.</p>
               <p>The Divines continued their Diſputations till the
laſt day of the laſt month; and ſince the ſecond In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
the Biſhops have been Voting upon the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
that have been propoſed to them. So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the courſe the Legate takes, they will
have done in five or ſix days; and after that, the
time that remains will be ſpent in forming the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees;
which being done, the Biſhops will return
to give their Votes to them, and paſs them into
Doctrines.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip may ſee by this how they intend to
employ the time that is behind, though nothing is
more certain, than that thorough the artifices and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
that are uſed, to ingage people, and thorough
the Council's having no ſtrength left, it being total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deprived of its authority and freedom by the
Legate, who has taken it all entirely into his own
hand; if a Seſſion were to laſt half a year, it would
be the ſame thing as it is now, ſo that we ſhall have
no cauſe to wonder at any thing that ſhall be done
here, but ſhall have great cauſe to be thankfull for
what they ſhall leave undone.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Malvenda</hi> had been very ill of a Catarrh, but
is now pretty well again, he has not deſerved to be
ſick, and is a perſon for whom I have a very great
kindneſs.</p>
               <p>I kiſs your Lordſhip's hands a thouſand times,
for what you have done in relation to my particular
affairs; and I do rely ſo much on your friendſhip,
that I take but little care of them my ſelf.</p>

               <p>I Have already writ to your Lordſhip at large,
as I do now again, our affairs requiring I ſhould
do ſo. His Majeſty's Diſpatches, which were very
proper, and ſuch as I wiſhed them, being arrived,
<hi>Don Franciſco</hi> has been to ſpeak with the Legate. It
would be a tedious buſineſs to Relate all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57465:72"/>
between them; for which Reaſon, and becauſe
<hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> himſelf muſt have writ an account
of it; I ſhall only tell you, that the Legate beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himſelf on this, as he has done on all other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
and as we expected of him, <hi>Perfricuit nempe
frontem inſigniter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip may be ſatisfy'd, that there
are not words to Expreſs the pride, diſreſpect and
ſhameleſneſs, wherewith he proceeds in theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
for being perſuaded that we act timorouſly,
and that his Majeſty will be cautious how he do's
any thing, that may Miniſter occaſion to any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or that may diſguſt the Pope; he ſays and
do's things that aſtoniſh the World, treating the
Prelates that are here as ſo many Slaves, proteſting
and ſwearing when he is diſpleaſed, that he will
be gone immediately, by which means he carries
whatever he has a mind to. And as there is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
of his ever changing his behaviour; ſo the
ſucceſs and end of this Synod, if God by a Miracle
do's not prevent it, will be ſuch as I have foretold;
I ſay by a Miracle, becauſe it is not to be done by
any humane means; ſo that his Majeſty do's but
tire himſelf in vain in negotiating with the Pope
and his Miniſters, <hi>Nam ſurdo canitur &amp; lapis deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur.</hi>
The fruit of his Majeſty's Diſpatch is ſuch
as I gueſſed it would be; that is, it has made the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
much worſe than he was before, who has ſince
hammered out ſuch an Infamous Reformation (for
it deſerves no better Epithet) as muſt make us <hi>fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
&amp; rifus populo.</hi> I am not able to expreſs how much
it troubles me to ſee God and his Majeſty, thus
Diſhonoured, <hi>Sed res ipſa loquitur;</hi> the Prelates
that are here do likewiſe reſent it highly, many of
them reckoning that they wound their Conſciences
by holding their Tongues, and by ſuffering things
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57465:72"/>
to be carried thus; and who tho' they have hitherto
with much ado been kept by ſome Offices that have
been done them from doing their duties; ſo that
two Seſſions have paſs'd as your Lordſhip ſees; I am
perſuaded nevertheleſs, that if other courſes are not
taken, that no Offices will be able to Reſtrain
them much longer, they are ſo extreamly ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
               <p>The Legate was not to be perſuaded to treat about
any thing that was in the Memorial; and as I have
writ before, it would be well if he could never be
brought to it: For whenever he ſhall condeſcend
to do any thing, it will certainly be for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the prejudice
of the Church, and eſpecially of his Majeſty's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
               <p>Every body do's not ſee the Legate's deſign in
the buſineſs of Benefices with Cure, which he is very
forward to talk of; having of his own accord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
that the Pope will never give his Conſent
to it.</p>
               <p>For the Legate being ſenſible, that many of the
Biſhops, for their own Intereſt, are extreamly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to have it paſs, he hopes they may be brought
to make ſuch a bargain with him as he drives at,
and as the preſent Pope, when he was Legate
here, aimed at likewiſe: who propoſed it to the
Biſhops, offering them the Collation of all Benefices
with Cure, provided, the Expeditions did all paſs
at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope be re-imburſed, by having
all other Benefices lodged in him, which is the thing
they graſp at: Now this being a moſt inconvenient
and abominable bargain, the Legate, of his own
accord, declares that the Pope will never agree to it;
which, if I have any Judgment, he ſaith for no other
end, but to put the Biſhops in mind to deſire it of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57465:73"/>
him: For the clearer underſtandng of which matters
and practiſes, I writ to your Lordſhip on the 13th In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
my thoughts of the Memorial, and of other
affairs; now if this matter of Benefices ſhould come
to be treated of here, we ought, in the firſt place,
to put the Pope's Miniſters upon ſhewing what right
his Holineſs has to collate to any Benefice whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
and having brought them to that, I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to demonſtrate, from the Principles and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of the Law of God, and of Nature, and of
Men; and from the ancient uſage of the Church,
and from good policy, that he has no manner of
right to it; and all this without doing Injury to his
Dignity, and the plenitude of his Power. But the
Pope having now by degrees and force, got all into
his own hands, he gives the World to underſtand
that all is his, and that what any body elſe has, is what
he is willing to give them. From hence it is that
the wretched Canoniſts, I meam ſome of them, do
either out of fear, or flattery, or both, ſtyle the Pope
<hi>Dominus beneficiorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in the handling of this affair, if the proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Benefices ſhould be lodged in the Biſhops, care
muſt be taken that fleſh and blood be not allowed
ſo much liberty as it has been accuſtomed to; but
that it be ſo ordered as to partake of the ancient
uſage, either by Examination or ſome other way
that ſhall be judged moſt convenient, that ſo an
eye may be had therein to the profit of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and the Sheep, and not only of the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>But this being a matter of ſo great moment, and
which cannot be treated of in theſe times, but to the
prejudice of the Church, and eſpecially of <hi>Spain,</hi>
the beſt way, now the Pope carries every thing he
has a mind to, will be not to meddle with it at all,
but to reſerve the handling thereof to a better time,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57465:73"/>
                  <hi>Quo purgabit Dominus filios Levi;</hi> which purgation
muſt come, and that with a ſevere Scourge; or
till God ſhall provide other remedies, which may
be applied at ſome time or other; it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
that a thing ſo violent, and ſo fraught with
Abuſes, ſhould hold long; the whole Nerve of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Diſcipline being broke, and the Goods of
God made a perfect Trade, and Merchandiſe. As
to the Head of reviving Provincial Councils, which
is in the Memorial, it has put the Legate in a great
Diſorder: This is one of the things that was put in
the Memorial, without my advice, who do pretend
to underſtand, what the Pope and his Miniſter's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions
are in that matter; for that being a thing
the Church has ſo often done, and ſtill has autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to do, it ought not to have been propoſed here
as a new matter; but ſuch Councils ought to be
called frequently, as was the cuſtom in former
times. This is a thing of that Importance, that I
have often, and I will always ſay it, That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration
of the Church is chiefly to be expected
from the reviving and celebrating of Provincial
Councils, the Ruin thereof having proceeded from
the Ceſſation of them, which, among other Effects,
would prevent Secular Princes, being brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
neceſſity of medling with things, to the Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Eccleſiaſtical Immunity; in which, if
ſome Remedies are not found out for their great
Neceſſities, and ſome holy and lawfull Courſes for
the obtaining of Juſtice, they cannot forbear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
themſelves: I ſay this of Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
becauſe the Celebration of ſuch as are general,
is, as we ſee by Experience, like the <hi>Ludi Seculares,</hi>
to be brought about but once in an Age, if ſo often;
and when one comes to be celebrated, it is done in
ſuch a manner as we now ſee; inſomuch that, this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57465:74"/>
which is now ſitting here, muſt totally undeceive
the World, ſo as to convince it; that by reaſon of
the Oppoſition and Induſtry of the Popes, to engroſs
all to themſelves, nothing of Reformation is ever
to be expected from a General Council.</p>
               <p>Now they being ſenſible that General Councils, by
reaſon of the Diſcords of Chriſtian Princes, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
ſome other Cauſes I have formerly given, are
thus in bondage, they do all they are able to hinder
the reviving of Provincial Synods, except the Pope's
Legates or Vicars are preſent at them, that ſo they
may leave no breath in the Church, nor in any of
its Members, to the excluſion of all Remedies, and
all talk of them. The Pope that now is, when he
was here, had his Pretenſions about this thing; and
had he gone on as he began, he had certainly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them, having been ſeconded therein by ſeveral:
And there was a certain Prelate, who, in a General
Seſſion, had the Confidence to ſay on that Occaſion,
That the Councils of <hi>Toledo</hi> were all held in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to the Apoſtolical See, with a great deal
more ſuch ſtuff, which gave no ſmall offence to a
great many, thoſe Councils having been ſo famous,
and of ſo great advantage to the Church: He that
ſpoke this was the Biſhop of <hi>Jano,</hi> who has been
ſince made a Cardinal, and as they write at the
Nomination of his Majeſty; who, though a Perſon
of great Honour, ſpoke this, becauſe he knew it
would be gratefull to the Legates, and would make
way for his promotion: I have ſaid this, becauſe I
would not have things wherein the Pope and his
Court have ſuch great Intereſts and Pretenſions, to
be decided or handled here, ſince it cannot be done
but to our great prejudice, and to the great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole Church, which at preſent has
neither ſtrength nor courage to reſiſt; and if God
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57465:74"/>
do not remedy it, I do not ſee when it will: This
is a thing I am poſitive in, it being what I owe to
the Service of God, and his Majeſty, to whom I
deſire your Lordſhip to Communicate this, and
what-ever elſe I do in diſcharge of my Office, it
being of moment to his Majeſty's Kingdoms, <hi>Spain</hi>
eſpecially, that it ſhould be done.</p>
               <p>The Legate, among other Chapters of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
did pretend to put theſe that follow; which
being ſo prejudicial, and to <hi>Spain</hi> eſpecially, we with
much ado prevailed with him to let them alone till
his Majeſty was firſt conſulted. <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> muſt
have writ at large about this matter; I will never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
write my Opinion thereof, and what I ſaid
of it here, that notwithſtanding the ſecond and third
look like ſomething; they are really of no moment,
and yet under their colour the reſt muſt be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and by that means, that which is ſo much
wiſhed for, will become incurable.</p>
               <p>The firſt Tonſure, let Canoniſts ſay what they
will, is not, nor never was properly an Order, but
a Sign or a Door whereby to enter into Orders; for,
according to the Maſter of the Sentences, St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
and all other Divines, where there is no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
one cannot properly be called a Clerk, as
there is not in the firſt Tonſure; neither is all that
the Canoniſts, and <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third ſay thereof,
to be taken ſtrictly, but in a large ſenſe: The firſt
Tonſure being really no other than a Novitiate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been inſtituted only for ſuch, as did actually
ſerve in the Church, and were dedicated to the
Divine Service; for which reaſon, the Conſent of
Secular Princes was neceſſary to the giving of it; it
appearing juſt, that ſuch Miniſters ſhould enjoy ſome
Exemption; but at this time, that whole matter is
run into ſuch diſorder, that nothing of the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57465:75"/>
is now obſerved, to the exceeding great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the Common-wealth; every one that will
now, may wear a Crown for Six-pence and two
Clips with a Ciſſers, and ſo plead an Exemption
from the Royal Juriſdiction, committing all the
Crimes they pleaſe without fear of Puniſhment:
The true Remedy for this is, to put ſuch a ſtop to
it as is neceſſary, and not to be ſatisfy'd with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this Exemption taken from all Clerks that ſhall
Marry; as alſo to have new Orders made about the
Habit and Tonſure: Concerning which, the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts
have made ſtrange work, having made many
Jeſts as well as Falſhoods to paſs for current Truths.
When I ſpeak of the Canoniſts, I ſpeak as a Thief
of the Family, being ſenſible of the Abuſes which
have been authorized by them in the Church, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
out of Ignorance, or for ſome baſe End; for
which reaſon, what I ſay of them ought to be the
more regarded. There are three Remedies for this:
The firſt is, That the firſt Tonſure ſhall be of no
advantage to any that are not actually employ'd in
Divine Service, as has been ſaid. The ſecond is,
That the firſt Tonſure ſhall never be given but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Order of Subdiaconate, which,
ſince the Time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, for it was not
ſo before, has been an holy Order, and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Crown ſhall be of no benefit. The third
is, That the firſt Tonſure ſhall be of no advantage
to any, that are not Ordained to ſome holy Order
within a year, as it is ſaid to be at <hi>Venice;</hi> the two
firſt are the moſt proper Remedies, there being no
need of having more ſhaven Crowns, unleſs it be to
increaſe Miſchiefs, to diſturb the Common-wealth,
and to carry Cauſes and Money to <hi>Rome;</hi> what they
drive at in this matter, being <hi>ne quoquo modo minua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
Meſſis illa aurea ad quam Stratocles &amp; Democlides
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57465:75"/>
ſeſe mutuo invitare ſolebant, ſic nempe joco Tribunal &amp;
Curiam appellare conſueverunt:</hi> But in caſe it cannot
be thus remedied, as I do not believe it will, it not
being a thing to be expected, that the Pope and his
Officers ſhould ever give their Conſents to it. It
will then be convenient to let it remain as it is;
and that the rather, becauſe Princes, upon their not
having ſuffered the Council to remedy it, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
it themſelves; for his Majeſty may, without
any Scruple of Conſcience, redreſs it in his own
Kingdoms, by puniſhing his Lay-Subjects; for ſuch
they are in reality, there being neither Law nor Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for their being exempted from the Royal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
neither can they help themſelves by any
thing that has been Ordained by the Church to
which they do not belong, notwithſtanding all the
Diſputes that have been about them betwixt the
Eccleſiaſtical and Secular Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>The 4th Chapter is extreamly prejudicial, and
is levelled chiefly at his Majeſty and his Kingdoms;
about which there are ſo ancient and laudable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
Privileges, Inſtruments and Cuſtoms in
<hi>Spain</hi> already, that the Legate cannot carry what
he pretends to, without wronging, if not ſubverting
all thoſe Conſtitutions, and all the Styles of the
Councils and Chanceries, ſuch as the taking cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of the Violences and Outrages committed by
Eccleſiaſticks, and Baniſhing them the Kingdom,
when they hinder the Royal Juriſdiction, or diſquiet
and diſturb the Common-wealth, and commit hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Crimes, and have none to puniſh them for
them, or tranſgreſs the Orders of <hi>Madrid</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the not beſtowing of Benefices and Penſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Strangers, or for offending againſt any of the
Pre-eminency of thoſe Kingdoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To act thus,
being the Defence and Conſervation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57465:76"/>
and the Rights thereof, and not the uſing of
Coercive Juriſdiction upon the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
and Immunities. All which matters, if I
am not miſtaken, are thorowly handled in ſome
Books I have compoſed here, which hereafter may
be made publick. In which Cauſes we muſt be
ſure to be always upon our guard with the Legate,
who is certainly a grand Architect, having a ſtrange
Faculty of ſeeming to give ſomething, when he gives
nothing; and of laying up Matter for Plea, which
muſt hereafter help the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to Money,
which is the main End he drives at in this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>The 5th Chapter, which ſpeaks of the Immunity,
ought likewiſe to be conſidered; leſt, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying
what the Secular Juriſdiction and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
do at preſent ſuffer thereby, they, by
ſeeming to yield ſomething, deſtroy all, by giving a
Power to the Prelates to ſend Laicks to their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and having taken cognizance of their Crimes,
to joyn with the Secular Judge in puniſhing them.
Now this is a fetch, no Man but the Legate could
ever have dreamt of. What is pretended to, and
deſired in this matter, being that heinous Crimes
may not be committed, without being puniſhed, by
the Eccleſiaſticks, Secular and Regular, at every
turn defending their Churches, and the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals
that have fled to them, with Arms, and a
thouſand other Methods. Now to put down San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries
wholly, would appear too rigorous, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Derivation they have from the Law of
God, or from the Cities of Refuge that were under
the Old Teſtament; or as <hi>Abulenſis</hi> well obſerves,
that were at all Times, and in all Nations, that all
might not be like the Laws of <hi>Draco,</hi> nothing but
Blood. And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his <hi>Civitate Dei</hi> obſerves,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57465:76"/>
That when <hi>Rome</hi> was taken by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that
they offered no Violence to the <hi>Heathens,</hi> that had
taken ſanctuary in the Churches. All this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
things are viſibly reduced to ſuch a
paſs that ſome courſe muſt be taken to prevent the
manifold Diſorders that flow from theſe Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that ſo there may be Puniſhments; and that
the Common-wealth may be preſerved in Peace,
which is the end of Secular Magiſtrates: For which
reaſon, the Emperor <hi>Tiberius,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> relates in
his Life, was ſo much offended at the manifold
Crimes that were committed under the ſhelter of the
Sanctuaries, which were diſperſed all over <hi>Italy,</hi>
that he diſſolved them all at once.</p>
               <p>We are now to ſee how the fore-mentioned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
may be ſo remedied, that the Words
of our Lord, <hi>My Houſe is the Houſe of Prayer, but
you have made it a Den of Thieves,</hi> may not be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in this Caſe. It is no eaſie thing to find a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for it; but if Churches muſt ſtill enjoy their
Immunities, it will be neceſſary that neither Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
nor Regulars, nor no Eccleſiaſtical Judges,
ſhall defend any Church or Offender, that is in it,
with any other than Spiritual Arms, which are the
only Arms that belong to them; neither muſt it be
lawfull for them to make any manner of reſiſtance,
or to lock their doors, or to give any other Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
to the Secular Judges, whom they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
by Religion, and not by Force: For, beſides
the raiſing of Tumults, there are other Reaſons
why it ſhould not be lawfull for Eccleſiaſticks to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their Churches with Arms, as their not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what they defend; or whether the Caſe be ſuch
as can claim Sanctuary; or whether the Secular
Judges may not lawfully take the Offender out of the
Church, there being Caſes wherein they may do it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57465:77"/>
without having recourſe to the Eccleſiaſticks. It
ought farthermore to be declared, That no perſon
guilty of Fore-thought Murther, Wounding, or
any other ſuch Crime, is to have the benefit of a
Sanctuary; neither ought all Churches, Monaſtries,
and Chappels, to enjoy that privilege, but only ſome
particular Churches that ſhall be appointed.</p>
               <p>This is what I have to offer, at preſent, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the foreſaid Chapters. As to which, and every
thing elſe, his Majeſty may Command what he ſhall
judge to be moſt convenient; and whatſoever ſhall
appear ſo to your Lordſhip, will appear the ſame
to me: Nevertheleſs, there is one thing I will be
poſitive in, which is, That we do but tire our ſelves
here in vain, ſince without a Miracle nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Pope and his Court have any Intereſts or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions,
can be determined here, but to our great
prejudice: For notwithſtanding they have in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
cancelled all former Laws, and under a pretence
of diſpenſing with them, have diſſipated them: They
are not willing nevertheleſs, that there ſhould be any
new Laws made againſt Abuſes, for fear of offering
too much Violence to People's Conſcience; or leſt
that after they are made, Secular Princes ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them to obſerve them. Of the truth of all that
has been ſaid, what has paſſed concerning the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption
of Chapters, which ought to have been
quite taken away, that ſo there might be ſomething
of Order and Diſcipline; and that they who are the
Head, ſhould not be made the Feet is a ſufficient
Evidence. Which Decree of the Council will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
by the <hi>Rota,</hi> not to comprehend any
Chapters that enjoy an Immemorial Preſcription,
or that were exempted at the Erection of the Church,
or that were defending their being exempted at the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> at the time when that Decree was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57465:77"/>
pronounced: By which Exceptions the Decree is
laid flat upon the ground, being nothing, in truth,
but a matter of Money and Law-ſuits; for the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
upon a bare Allegation of any of thoſe things,
without any manner of proof, will be protected by
that Court; and ſuch of them as were never in the
ſolid poſſeſſion of any ſuch Exemption, ſhall give the
Biſhops trouble enough, if they ſhall offer to call
them in queſtion. God knows how ſenſible I was
of this, and of what was moſt convenient to have
been put into this Decree; which, as your Lordſhip
may remember, was, that all thoſe Evaſions ſhould
have been pulled up by the roots, that ſo no Gate
might have been left open for tricks; for I would
fain know why Preſcription, Immemorial Poſſeſſion
and Erections, ſhould hinder the Church, or the
Legiſlator, from reforming Abuſes, and from doing
what is moſt expedient for the Common-wealth:
For, from the time that Abuſes may be defended
by Immemorial Cuſtom, a door is ſhut againſt all
Remedies for the future, and all Sins may plead
Preſcription. In a word; the Legates acted in this,
as they do in every thing elſe; that is, they would
not ſuffer the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to be deprived of ſo
great a profit; and for that reaſon did, according
to their Cuſtom, favour the Chapters againſt the
Biſhops; pretending, as an Auditor of the <hi>Camara,</hi>
who is ſince made a Cardinal, ſaid once publickly,
That the Honour of the Apoſtolical See was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by the Chapters. Your Lordſhip may ſee
by this how well they know what they do, and
what likelihood there is of having any thing redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
here. I have ſent your Lordſhip a Memorial of
the Council of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which was made before this
Council was called; as alſo the <hi>Pragmatica</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid:</hi>
Which orders no Benefices or Penſions to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57465:78"/>
beſtowed upon Strangers, with ſeveral other things.
This Memorial was put into my hands by the
Council, and I ſent it with another as big or bigger
to his Majeſty in the Year 1545.</p>
               <p>Vainly imagining at that time that ſomething
might have been done in earneſt at <hi>Trent,</hi> and that
the time of our redemption was come; but ſince
it would now only trouble your Lordſhip to read
it, I forbear to ſend it to you, but ſhall cite Things
out of it as there ſhall be occaſion, being prepared
whenever your Lordſhip ſhall command it, and
there ſhall appear any hopes of its doing any good,
to write a Book upon the ſame Subject, if it ſhall
be thought neceſſary.</p>
               <p>There is one thing I am always poſitive in; which
is, That whatſoever <hi>Spain</hi> is in poſſeſſion of, and
doth juſtly defend, that ſhe ought not to ſuffer it to
be called in queſtion, nor ſeek to have it granted by
the Council, no not though it were free, and much
leſs from ſuch a Council as this; for it is our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to be always Defendants, and not Plaintiffs,
and eſpecially conſidering how things are carried
here, where it is plain the Pope and his Miniſters
will carry whatever they have a mind to, though
never ſo much to our prejudice. This is what I have
always ſaid and adviſed.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip will ſee by this, that the firſt
Chapter of the Memorial that was delivered to the
Legate, relating to Benefices, with Cure, was not
well weighed, it being prejudicial to <hi>Spain,</hi> which
ought to keep it ſelf upon the Defenſive. Whoever
he was that drew up that Memorial, was not
throughly acquainted with theſe Affairs, as appears
by his having ſaid that the Rule of Language ought
to be obſerved, as if that were the whole buſineſs
or the ſole Reaſon why Benefices ſhould be beſtowed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57465:78"/>
only on the Natives: Whereas, in truth, it is an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
founded on Divine, Natural, and Humane
Juſtice; that as to all ſorts of Benefices, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
ought to be preferred to Strangers, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they do underſtand the Language, which
beſides ancient Cuſtom, has ſeveral Grants to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it. This, with ſeveral other Preſcriptions for
the obviating of Frauds, ſhall at ſome time or other,
be publiſhed in the Books which I have writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
theſe Affairs; the laſt of which are in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the ſaid <hi>Pragmatica;</hi> the firſt confirming it
by the Common Law of Nations, and the ſecond
by the Municipal Laws of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is all I ſhall ſay of Reformation, and as to
their way of handling Doctrines, I have a great
deal to ſay of it; I gave your Lordſhip ſome time
ago an account of the Legate's Conduct here, but
I have now ſome thing to add: It troubles one to
ſee how thoſe matters are managed and determined
here, the Legate doing whatever he has a mind to,
without either numbering or weighing the Opinions
of the Divines and Prelates, hurrying and reſerving
the ſubſtance of things, which ought to have been
well weighed and digeſted to the laſt Minute, the
Major part not knowing what they are a doing,
I mean before the fact; for believing that Chriſt
will not ſuffer them to Err in their Determinations,
I ſhall bow down my head to them, and believe all
the Matters of Faith that ſhall be decided by them; I
pray God every body elſe may do the ſame: But what
is chiefly to be noted, is, That the Eminent Divines
that are ſent hither by his Majeſty, namely the
Dean and Profeſſors of <hi>Lovain,</hi> Perſons ſo famous
for Learning and Piety, are never called to the
making of the Canons and Doctrines, nor ſuffered
to ſee, whether there be any thing amiſs in them.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57465:79"/>
This is a great fault, and is much complained of,
to the great diſcredit of all they do, a great many
taking occaſion from thence to have no great regard
for their Decrees, fearing they may hereafter mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
Matter to Controverſies.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary his Majeſty ſhould write warmly
concerning this matter to his Ambaſſador, namely
<hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> commanding him to concern himſelf
earneſtly therein; for it is a ſhame that things ſhould
be carried thus, and ſuch great and eminent Divines
ſhould be brought from the end of the World, only
to Diſpute one hour in a Seſſion without being ever
ſo much as thought of after that is over; whereas
when Matters of Faith are to be determined, they
ought to be examined with great Application, and
people ought to tremble when they are about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
new Articles, or to declare ſuch as have formerly
been determined by the Church, and not to paſs them
as they do in a hurry; the Pope's Miniſters being for
making Articles of Faith of divers Diſputable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and againſt declaring other things which
would be of great Moment, in remedying the Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which are crept into the Aminiſtration of the
Sacraments: As to all which, the Pope and his
Miniſters are, for the fore-mentioned and other Ends,
continually upon their guard; and they having got
the Managery and Authority of the Council intirely
into their hands, do reckon they have got a great
prize in Carrying things as they do: So that if God
do's not by ſome extraordinary Ways provide for
his Church, there is no hopes left of ever ſeeing it
either united or reformed; for what was it but ſuch
doings as theſe, and the taking no care to reform in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
Abuſes, that has deſtroy'd ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
and Kingdoms; and it is Juſtly to be feared,
that what is done in this Council, may endanger
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57465:79"/>
the deſtroying of the reſt. But that the Church
ſhould be reduced to this eſtate, and that Hereſies
ſhould ſo much prevail, is the accompliſhment of
what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the 2d Chapter of his 2d Epiſt.
to the <hi>Theſſalonians: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs a Departure come firſt,</hi> &amp;c.
Which words are applied expreſsly by St. <hi>Anſelm</hi>
and others to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> on account of
the fore-mentioned Vices and Abuſes, which we
now ſee by Experience: which Text, though it has
other Interpretations, may God beſtow better things
on us than we deſerve. The Legate runs on, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitating
things as I writ your Lordſhip formerly,
whoſe deſign at preſent is to finiſh what remains of the
Sacrifice of the Maſs, and of the Sacrament of Order,
in the Seſſion of <hi>January;</hi> intending in two Seſſions
more to conclude the whole buſineſs, diſpatching that
of Matrimony in the firſt, and in the ſecond that of
Images, the Veneration of Saints, the Monaſtical
Vows, and I do not know what other things, and
ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>I have it from a good hand, that four days ago
he received a Letter from Cardinal <hi>Maffeius,</hi> who
ſent him word that the Council would be ſhut up in
<hi>May,</hi> and that he needed not therefore to lay in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
for any longer time. Your Lordſhip may
be pleaſed to Joyn this to what has formerly been
written to you, to the ſame purpoſe. I muſt tell
you farther, that this Council drawing ſo near an
end, is what all people rejoyce at here exceedingly
there being a great many who wiſh it had never met;
and for my own part, I would to God it had never
been called, for I am miſtaken, if it do not leave
things worſe than it found them.</p>
               <p>The Report of the Naturalization, ſent by the
King of <hi>France</hi> to the Legate with 6000 Ducats,
is true; for the Legate himſelf has talked of it,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57465:80"/>
boaſting of the eſteem he is in with Princes, and
ſlighting the Naturalization was ſent to him by his
Majeſty, which he was heard to ſay was a thing of
no value. Your Lordſhip may ſee by this how
good an Imperialiſt he is, and how likely it is that
he will favour <hi>France</hi> in the Treaties which are
now on foot; I pray God theſe things may end well;
and that after having been at ſo much charge, we
be not intangled in new Troubles. I ſend your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the corrupt Canons of Reformation; but for
thoſe relating to Doctrines, I do not know whether
you can have them, having been told by one of the
Deputies, that it is not poſſible to get a Copy of
them from the Secretary of the Council: which
makes us believe they are firſt to be ſent to the Pope
to be conſidered on, upon the account I acquainted
you with, in a former Letter. So ſoon as I can have
them, they ſhall be ſent to your Lordſhip, who, I
am ſenſible, is very deſirous to be acquainted with
every thing that paſſeth here. Your Lordſhip does
well in letting no body know that I inform you of
theſe matters, it not being my intention therein to
take any body's Office from him, but only to ſerve
your Lordſhip, as I am bound to do: And ſo, at
this time, I write to no body but your Lordſhip
and Secretary <hi>Vargas,</hi> leaving others to the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador's
Diſpatches. May our Lord preſerve your
Lordſhip's moſt Illuſtrious and Reverend Perſon,
and proſper your State for many years, as I deſire.</p>

               <p>THE reaſon why I inlarged ſo much in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
was, that I might comply with my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in informing your Lordſhip of all that paſſeth
here; what at preſent offers, is, that matters of
Doctrine are ſtrangely precipitated, in not being
examined as they ought, as I have writ formerly,
the eminent Divines that are here not being ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to have any hand in them.</p>
               <p>The Decrees of Doctrine were not finiſhed till the
Night before the Seſſion, ſo that a great many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
gave their Placets, to what they neither did,
nor could underſtand; the Divines of <hi>Lovain</hi> and
<hi>Cologn,</hi> who came hither with their Elector, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Divines, being much diſſatisfy'd with
ſeveral of thoſe matters, have publickly declared
they were ſo; <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> and I having had ſome
Diſcourſe about it, it was thought fit that I ſhould
ſpeak to the Elector of <hi>Cologn,</hi> to learn how it was.
I did ſo, and was told by the Elector, that it was
very true, and that if the Legates went on handling
and determining Doctrines after ſuch a manner, they
would probably have <hi>Catholicks</hi> as well as <hi>Lutherans</hi>
for their Adverſaries. I deſired that theſe things
might not be made publick, and that he would take
care to prevent the like for the future, deſiring him
to ſend his Majeſty an Account of what had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
he promiſed to do ſo, and to treat with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
and me about all Affairs; adding, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his Divines were impatient to be gone,
and for having him with them; that he would not
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57465:81"/>
do it without having firſt obtained leave of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs of a Reformation proceeds ſo at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that it is not poſſible it ſhould go worſe, ſo that
all we do here is to ſpend time to no purpoſe, unleſs,
it be to reduce <hi>Germany</hi> to a worſe eſtate than it
was in before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> has told me ſomething of Dr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s
having ſpoke with the Divines of <hi>Lovain,</hi> who
have ſince been obſerved to be more tractable than
they were; ſo far as I can underſtand, this is a very
bad buſineſs, and ſhould things of this nature come
once to be ſo publick, that Inſtances might be given
thereof in particular Caſes, it muſt totally ruine the
Credit of all that has, or ſhall be done here, and
muſt hinder the Council, from ever being received
either in <hi>Flanders</hi> or <hi>Germany.</hi> Pray ſee what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
the Pope and his Miniſters give, and how
well they deſerve to go to the bottom, and we along
with them.</p>
               <p>Some are of Opinion, that the Legate's deſign in
putting things off thus to the laſt, is, that there
may be no time left for a Reformation; but I am
apt to think they are miſtaken, for though it is moſt
certain, that a Reformation is a thing that makes
the Legate ſtark mad, nevertheleſs I conceive they
have a farther deſign, in their ordaining and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing
Doctrines ſo, which is, that they may have the
better opportunity to ſhuffle their own Pretenſions
into them, as alſo to avoid the declaring and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
other neceſſary Matters; for though it is
only in ſuch things, that we ſay the Holy Ghoſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
them, ſo as not to ſuffer them to err, they do
not care for meddling with them.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould but allow my ſelf time, and liberty to
make Remarks upon all that has been done here, I
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57465:81"/>
could diſcover abundance of things, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what it is the Legates do drive at; but ſince
the doing thereof is not very neceſſary, becauſe your
Lordſhip, e're long will ſee it very plain, and I my
ſelf am ſomething ſcrupulous I ſhall ſay no more.</p>
               <p>As to the mighty freedom the Council injoys,
your Lordſhip is to know, that the Legate having
propoſed the Canons of Reformation in the laſt
Congregation, and being very earneſt for the paſſing
of one, which would have clearly approved of the
moſt pernicious abuſe of Commendams, which
have hitherto been authorized only by the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and I do not know what, of <hi>Gratian,</hi> and the
<hi>Canoniſts,</hi> ſeveral of the Prelates declared how
much they were diſſatisfy'd therewith, and among
others, the Biſhop of <hi>Verdun,</hi> who is a good pious
Man, ſaid, That this would be an unprofitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and both unworthy of the Synod, and
unſuitable to the Exigencies of the Times, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendams
being the great devourers of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Revenues, calling it farther, <hi>A pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi>
the Legate having treaſured all this up,
fell upon him afterwards with very rude Language,
and which was contrary to that Regard and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which, <hi>ſi Diis placet,</hi> the Council ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy;
calling him a Boy, an impudent raw Man,
with a great many other hard names, neither would
he ſuffer him to offer one word in his own defence,
telling him with great heat, that he knew how to
have him chaſtiſed, and ſo the Biſhop remain'd as if
he had ſpoke ſome horrid Blaſphemy againſt God,
no body, <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> happening to be abſent, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
or daring to ſpeak one word in his favour.</p>
               <p>A great many, but eſpecially the Electors, are
much ſcandalized at this Behaviour; he of <hi>Cologne,</hi>
when he ſpoke to me of it, told me a great deal
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57465:82"/>
more to the ſame purpoſe, and by what I hear
commonly diſcourſed among them, it is not unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the Prelates may at ſome time or other come
to break with the Legate, for I am told, they ſay
already, that there is no more of a Council than the
Legate is pleaſed to allow.</p>
               <p>By what I have ſaid in this and my former, it is
eaſie to perceive, how neceſſary it is that his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
ſhould apply himſelf, with all poſſible warmth
and expedition to oblige the Pope and his Miniſters
to take other Meaſures, and to mind a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as they ought to do; that ſo the tricks which
we may otherwiſe expect to meet with in the next
Seſſion may be prevented, and that what has coſt his
Majeſty ſo much to ſupport, may not come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which his Majeſty, through the Iniquity of
the Times, the Heat of the War, and for the ſake
of the Pope's Friendſhip; and ſeveral other cauſes, is
deeply concerned to look after.</p>
               <p>It is really a matter of amazement, to ſee how
things appertaining to God are handled here, and
that there ſhould not be one to contend for him, or
that hath the Courage to ſpeak in his behalf; but
that we ſhould be all <hi>Canes muti, non valentes latrare,</hi>
and look on and ſuffer the Miſeries of the Church
to become incurable, and <hi>Germany</hi> to be quite loſt,
Abuſes to be authorized, and his Majeſty to be thus
diſhonoured after he has been at ſo much pains, and
has made uſe of all his Power, and has made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
to procure a Reformation by a free Council,
whereas the Authority not only of this, but of all
Councils for the future, is utterly deſtroy'd: If I
ſhould not complain of this, and take care frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to repreſent it, I ſhould neither be a Chriſtian
nor do my Duty to my Prince, I, thanks be to God
for it, and the whole World being ſenſible of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57465:82"/>
Sincerity of his Majeſty's Endeavours in this affair,
and of his not having been wanting on his part, to
reduce all people to their Duties to the Publick.
I pray God proſper his Endeavours, that ſo this
blind Generation of people may be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and to be wiſe at laſt.</p>
               <p>When any thing more ſhall offer, and I ſhall be
ſatisfy'd that there is no remedy to be expected
here, I ſhall then adviſe what I ſhall judge to be
moſt convenient, which I ſhall deferr till that
time.</p>
               <p>Affairs do look ſo very ill here, that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
I could wiſh that his Majeſty's Name and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
might be made uſe of in this place, as ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly
as it is poſſible; and that it be never done,
but when there is an extream neceſſity for it: For
there do not want other ways whereby his Miniſters
may oblige the Legate and Prelates that are here to
do what is convenient, without telling them that his
Majeſty commands it; I leave this with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
to judge whether there is not ſomething in
it.</p>
               <p>As to the Reformation they are now hammering
upon; all that I ſhall ſay of it, is, That in being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
prejudicial to, and unhappy for us, it will
be much for the advantage of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which will be ſure to value it ſelf upon tricks; ſo
that nothing ſhall be done, but what ſhall ſerve to
create Law-ſuits, and to confirm Abuſes: Such as
the continuing of Titular Biſhops, whom they
ought to aboliſh; for beſides the miſchiefs they do,
the creation of ſuch is contrary to the Canons,
they being much the ſame with the <hi>Choro-epiſcopi,</hi>
who were anciently taken away by Pope <hi>Damaſus;</hi>
as alſo the continuing of Conſervatories, which are
the bane of the World; and which do ſo much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57465:83"/>
the Peace of the Common-wealth, by occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
frequent Diſputes about Juriſdictions, to the
ſpending of vaſt Summs of Money: But for the
ſame Reaſons for which Abuſes ought to be aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
they take care to eſtabliſh them, and after
ſuch a manner as is moſt for their advantage. I
do pray heartily that our Lord would be pleaſed to
remove theſe and all other ſuch Abuſes, ſince we
are fallen into ſuch Times; that though we had
ſome hopes given us of having them redreſſed, yet
through the Legate's carrying what-ever he has a
mind to, thoſe hopes are now all vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>The Article of Reſerved Caſes in matters of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
is a thing I could ſay a great deal more of,
than I am willing to write. May God remedy
things, and preſerve and proſper your moſt Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Perſon and State for many years, as I deſire.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>IN a Letter I writ to your Lordſhip two days a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
I gave you an account of what had paſſed
here concerning ſome Matters of Doctrine with
the Divines of <hi>Lovain</hi> and <hi>Cologne;</hi> that buſineſs
has put all things here into a terrible Confuſion:
The Legate, though he do's all he can to diſſemble
it, being in great diſorder about it; for he muſt have
no Eyes, if he do's not ſee what he has done; and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57465:83"/>
into how great a Confuſion he has brought things
by his Violence, which very well deſerves to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by another name.</p>
               <p>This, as I intimated in my laſt was the Cauſe
why he would not conſent to the giving out of any
Copies of thoſe Doctrines and Canons, having been
adviſed by <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> not to do it, untill ſuch
time as the buſineſs was made up, and quieted; and
the Legate himſelf now wiſheth that they were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
as to ſome particulars: both which things
are worth obſerving.</p>
               <p>Yeſterday, and the day before, the Legate ſent
for the Divines to ſatisfie them, and to put an End
to this buſineſs; I am of opinion it will be patched
up, though not ſo, but that a ſcarr will ſtill remain;
neither will it be poſſible to prevent its taking Air,
ſo far as not to furniſh the Hereticks with a great
deal of diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>This, as indeed every thing elſe that is done here,
furniſheth his Majeſty, in my judgment, with a fair
opportunity of repreſenting Matters nakedly, and as
they are, to the Pope; together with the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies
which muſt neceſſarily attend, their
not taking other Courſes in all matters than they
have done hitherto: For if he be governed by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
it is not poſſible, but that this buſineſs muſt
have had ſome effect upon him; and I am apt to
think, that God permitted this on purpoſe to make
them aſhamed, in order to the opening of their Eyes;
according to what is ſaid in the Pſalms, <hi>Imple facies
eorum ignominiâ, ut quaerant nomen tuum:</hi> I pray
God they may once begin to underſtand; though,
for my own part, as I have always ſaid, it is more
than I expect, if it is not done by a Miracle. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
muſt by no means loſe ſuch an opportunity as
this; which if cloſely and warmly purſued, may be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57465:84"/>
of great advantage. The Legate being ſenſible
thereof, told <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> yeſterday, when he ſpoke
to him, that he would give ſome new Orders about
the Divines, and that for the future they ſhould
be ſtill conſulted with and employ'd on all ſuch Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions;
and I do not doubt, but that in order to
help himſelf out of the difficulties he is at preſent
intangled in, he will do ſomething to ſweeten them,
I ſhall not fail to adviſe your Lordſhip of all that
ſhall occur. Our Lord preſerve and proſper your
moſt Illuſtrious Perſon and State for many years, as
I deſire.</p>

               <head>The following Paper is a Note writ with
Vargas's own Hand; but without his
Name, or any Date to it.</head>
               <p>WHat I writ to your Lordſhip on the 1ſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
I ſpoke of the other day to <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco,</hi>
and of the Caution and Secrecy wherewith it
ought to be managed; and that in order to adviſe
his Majeſty thereof, we ought, doing it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
ſecrecy, to inform our ſelves concerning that
affair by the three Deputies, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi>
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada,</hi> and the Biſhop of
<hi>Guadix;</hi> who being ſpoke to, ſaid the ſame I had
writ to your Lordſhip: And whereas <hi>Don Franciſco</hi>
did thereupon intend to have ſpoke craftily to the
Legate, to hear what he ſaid of it, that he might
be able to give his Majeſty the fuller Information
thereof: I diſſuaded him vehemently from doing it,
on account of the Inconveniencies that might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
its being talked of, before we knew his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
mind about it: I do ſuppoſe he has done ſo,
and has writ to his Majeſty concerning it, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
undoubtedly the beſt courſe in matters of ſo
great moment. The importance of this being ſuch,
that thorow it, and the great unhappineſs of the
Times, and Affairs being on ſuch terms as they are,
and the Councils being ſo debilitated as to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of ſtrength in it; ſo far as I am able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
there will be no remedy either for what is
paſt, or for what is to come, if God do's not put
his immediate Hand to it, and convert the Hearts
of thoſe People, which, as I have often ſaid, is a
thing I have no hopes at all of; becauſe I do not
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57465:85"/>
ſee how it can be done by any other way than by a
Miracle. Now if it ſhould not be thought expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for to make uſe of this at preſent, as indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
how things ſtand, it do's not ſeem to be;
it may then be laid up for another time, when it
may be of ſome advantage; for however there may
be ſome, who, to ſatisfie their Conſciences, ſo far
as is convenient, will write thereof; yet it will be
done ſo, as to defend its Truth, without taking any
notice of the miſchief that may follow thereon.</p>
               <p>I have likewiſe acquainted <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> with
what the Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> told me of their having
corrected and ſupply'd ſeveral Doctrines, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
his Divines, and thoſe of <hi>Lovain,</hi> had found
fault; and how though it appeared to him a very
ill buſineſs that they ſhould have given occaſion to
the doing of any ſuch thing; nevertheleſs, ſince it
had been done, to correct it was the leſſer Evil:
Whereupon <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> made the Deputies exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the Doctrines; which after they had done,
two of them, <hi>viz Sazar</hi> and <hi>Guadix,</hi> found two
other paſſages added in conformity of what the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
had told me, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granada</hi> being
in that matter of another Opinion. <hi>Don Franciſco</hi>
muſt, I believe, have writ at large concerning this;
which, let it be as it will, is a very bad buſineſs;
and being underſtood to be ſo by the Electors, I do
not know what may be the conſequence thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> has writ an account likewiſe of the
Electors; that is, <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Triers</hi> talking of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this place, and of the Fears <hi>Mentz</hi> is poſſeſſed
with; this is a thing his Majeſty is concerned to
take care of: Since if they go away, it will put an
End to all. To this I offered two Things: the One
was, That I had ſpoke and writ alſo to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of this pretence of <hi>Mentz</hi>'s, before there was
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57465:85"/>
any ſign of any Tumults in <hi>Germany;</hi> he having ſaid
before that, That ſince the <hi>French</hi> did not come to
the Council, it ought to be ſuſpended. The Other
was, That I did not doubt of the Legate's having
been the firſt Mover in this, who takes care to fill
<hi>Mentz</hi> with Fears, and to confirm them in him;
the chief Reaſons that are given by the one and the
other being the ſame; ſo that I do verily believe,
that what-ever <hi>Mentz</hi> ſaith concerning the Council,
is what the Legate has put into his head, excepting
what relates to a Reformation, wherein he agrees
with the reſt: Your Lordſhip muſt conſider what
is fit to be done in a matter of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I could never learn what the Doctrines were
that were changed and corrected by the Legate
upon the <hi>German</hi> Divines, contradicting them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had been Enacted by the Council:
Which change and correction, though it was
never known to any Proteſtant, ſo far as I can
learn, untill now that theſe Letters have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it; nevertheleſs, it muſt neceſſarily have
always had the ſame effect on the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>
that know of it, that it has now upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants;
which is, That General Councils are
either fallible in their Determinations of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines;
or elſe, that the Convention of <hi>Trent,</hi>
whoſe Decrees were altered for being Erroneous,
muſt not have been a General Council.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>What the Legate pretends, is, That in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of what has been concluded in the Diets,
and which though it had never been promiſed, would
have been in it ſelf reaſonable: The Proteſtants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are admitted into the Council, ought by
an expreſs Act to ſubmit themſelves to it, and to
that End ought for to have other Powers; thoſe
which have been exhibited by them, not being to be
endured, both for the ſaid Reaſon, as alſo on the
account of ſome Clauſes that are in them; namely,
that where it is ſaid,</hi> In eo compareant, deliberent &amp;
concludant indictum hoc Concilium (prout multis jam
habitis imperii Comitiis decretum eſt) libere, legitime
&amp; Chriſtiane celebretur: <hi>And where it is ſaid,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formationes
tam ſpiritualium quam ſecularium inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur:
<hi>And where it is ſaid at laſt,</hi> Denique alia om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
faciant &amp; omittant, quae nos ipſi facere ac omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57465:87"/>
poſſemus &amp; debemus, idque ſecundum inſtructio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
quam à nobis praeſcriptam habent: <hi>And where
it is ſaid,</hi> Quodcunque autem Conſiliarii noſtri ſupra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicti
noſtro nomine ſic agere aut perficere juverint id
firmum ratumque habebimus, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now what I have to offer, and did in effect ſay
to <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> and afterwards to the Legate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Affair, is, That a matter of ſo great
moment ought not to be precipitated, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt given an account thereof to his Majeſty,
that ſo he may order it, as he ſhall judge to be moſt
convenient; and ſhall ſignifie to us, what the Duke,
and the others, have promiſed in and out of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets;
and whether the Powers that are ſent by them
do agree with their Promiſes; or whether they are
obliged to ſend others, and by an expreſs Act to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themſelves to the Council. Furthermore, that
his Majeſty may ſee whether by what has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Diets, and promiſed by the Princes,
he can juſtifie his compelling them in due time to
accept of the Council, and of what ſhall be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
therein; but ſo, that That obligation may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
though he does not urge them to do it in this
place. Neither can it be truly ſaid, that their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and the Propoſitions which have been made by
them, are contrary to the Synod; ſince, in fact, they
do ſeem to approve of it, and ſubmit to it, rather
than impugne it; notwithſtanding their having put
in ſome Clauſes, which may hereafter ſerve for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges.</p>
               <p>It is furthermore to be conſidered, That it is one
thing to admit <hi>Catholicks,</hi> who muſt come qualify'd
as ſuch; and another to admit <hi>Hereticks,</hi> to whom
the Council and his Majeſty have granted a ſafe
Conduct: Who coming, ſtaying, and going back
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> may treat and ſpeak their Minds freely;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57465:88"/>
as the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> who returned home without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to a concluſion, did in the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi>
which afterwards ſent Legates to treat with them.
So that ſuch of the Proteſtants as have not either in
or out of the Diets obliged themſelves to ſubmit to
the Council, cannot be directly or indirectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to do it, without violating the ſafe Conduct,
and the ſecurity that has been given, for to ſay what
they pleaſe, concerning their Opinions and Errors,
without being puniſhed for it: For to tell them that
they muſt firſt acknowledge the Council to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
is, in effect, to bid them begone, and to tell
the reſt that they are not to come hither.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, Though it is but juſt, that all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
means ſhould be uſed to bring them to ſubmit
themſelves to the Council in all things; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
if they will not do it, they cannot, if not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
obliged, be compelled to it. Now they have a
ſafe Conduct granted them; but they ought rather,
as there is occaſion, and ſo far as it may be done
without danger, for to be careſſed, that ſo they may
not, with the ſuſpicions they have already, have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
given them for more, ſo as to hinder them from
coming hither, to the ruining of a buſineſs about
which ſo much pains has been taken. But beſides
this, there is another difficulty in this Affair: which
is, how the Synod, their Powers being ſuch as they
are, ſhall receive the <hi>Wirtenbourg</hi> and other Envoys;
and whether they ſhall be allowed to ſit. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
and ſome others, having declared reſolutely,
That unleſs they do ſubmit after the Example of
the Envoys of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> they ſhall have no Seats
granted them, becauſe the Allowance thereof would
be to incorporate them into the Synod. On which
occaſion I told the Legate, that ſuch as were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on a ſafe Conduct, had their Peculiarities; and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57465:88"/>
that he could not deny them a Seat, where the
granting thereof was not repugnant to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Council, and of the Acts thereof; as it
was not, at the Diſputations, and at the Seſſions, to
hear what was pronounced. And whereas had the
Duke come in Perſon, they would not have ſuffered
him for to have ſtood, but would have aſſigned him
a convenient Seat in the fore mentioned Places, the
Congregations of the Biſhops being excepted; that
he ought therefore, ſince the Duke is a Prince of the
Empire, to do the ſame to his Envoys, ſince it
might be done without any prejudice to the Synod,
or without incorporating them into it; for that,
properly ſpeaking, the Body of the Synod conſiſts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Prelates, who are the Judges, the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
not being of its Body, but are only joyned to it
by way of Aſſiſtance; and ſo do neither add to, nor
take from its Subſtance, being there only to make it
the more authoritative and ſolemn: Telling him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
That he ought to do all that is in his power to
win, and not exaſperate the Proteſtants. Of all
which, I reckoned it to be proper to give an account
to your Lordſhip, that ſo we may have a Reſolution
come quickly concerning it. May our Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and proſper your moſt Illuſtrious and Reverend
Perſon and State for many years, as I do deſire.</p>

                  <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> having writ concerning <hi>Mentz</hi> and

<hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> write you my Thoughts of them,

               <p>The Legate being much altered, and the time
not come as yet for <hi>Pighino</hi> to have a Cardinal's
Hat, they declare, that there is nothing to be done
but to ſuſpend the Council, having I do not know
what other Imaginations in their heads. This, if I am
not deceived, being the opportunity they have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for: However, I hope God will provide for us,
and his Majeſty will not fail to do what is neceſſary,
and eſpecially in not ſuffering the Electors to go, or
at leaſt not him of <hi>Cologne:</hi> For if there ſhould be
no perſuading them to ſtay to the laſt, when they

               <p>There is another Article that ought to be mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>The Electors have taken a better Reſolution, not
to make any change without his Majeſty's Licenſe;
which though they do ſtill inſiſt to have, we ſhall
nevertheleſs have the more time to anſwer them, and

Affair, ſince <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> has writ at large, there is
no need of my repeating it. Nevertheleſs, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that he has writ ſo to his Majeſty, and has

though I cannot do it by this Currier, I will in a

of it; though conſidering the perplexity thereof, and
the conveniencies there are on both ſides, it were
much more adviſable to hear, than to ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

               <p>I Do here perform what I promiſed your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
in mine of the 24th Inſtant, which was to
write to you concerning the Suſpenſion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
which is now ſo hotly talked of here, deſiring
that what I write, may be communicated to his
Majeſty.</p>
               <p>Now though conſidering in what forwardneſs
things are here it is poſſible I may have little to ſay
that will be of any importance, and conſidering how
your Lordſhip keeps up with all buſineſs, I may
have nothing to offer that will be new to you: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
I ſhall, as in duty bound, acquaint your
Lordſhip with my Thoughts thereof; which though
at preſent they may not, may hereafter ſignifie ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
I do not know whether, by reaſon of the
copiouſneſs of the Subject, I ſhall be able to be ſo
ſhort as I deſire.</p>
               <p>The Pope, as your Lordſhip very well knows, has
all along pretended to two Things: The firſt and
chief is to have the Council ſuſpended; and in caſe
he failed of that, then to make all the haſte he
could to bring it to an end, thereby to free himſelf
from ſuch a Yoke. I formerly acquainted your
Lordſhip with the Pope and his Miniſters, being
hard at work to bring this about, the Legate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
publickly declared that the Council might end
by <hi>May:</hi> Nevertheleſs the Suſpenſion, if feaſible, is
the thing they chiefly deſire, and are labouring hard
at this time to compaſs; and that for the following
Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57465:91"/>
1. Becauſe if they ſhould proſecute and put an
end to the Council, they will not then be able to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the encountring of one of theſe two Dangers;
either of being obliged to conſent to ſuch a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
as is neceſſary; which rather than yield to,
they will ſuffer all to go to wrack, or elſe they muſt
give over pretending any longer, that it belongs to
the Pope to reduce <hi>Germany,</hi> and reform the Church:
Whereby they will juſtifie Princes in applying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Remedies to their own Kingdoms, by all juſt and
holy Ways; which they reckon will be prevented,
by not putting an end to the Council; becauſe till
that is done, they will ſtill be able to gull the World,
with their having an intention to do great matters,
and will, according to their common practice, go on,
impoſing upon People with fair words and falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>2. By ſuſpending the Council, the Pope may hope
to gratifie the King of <hi>France,</hi> and procure his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſo far, as to make an advantageous Peace with
him; whereby his Court will hope, to draw the
ſame Profits from that Kingdom, as they did before
the Breach.</p>
               <p>3. What-ever is done therein, they will be ſure
to lay it all at his Majeſty's door; and will give it
out, that they were not the Cauſe of it. This they
are at this time labouring hard to bring about, by
reducing matters to ſuch terms, as may give ſome
colour to that pretence.</p>
               <p>4. By ſuſpending the Council, they will hinder
the Proteſtants from coming to it: Which is a thing
the Pope and his Miniſters cannot endure to think
of, being ſenſible to what ſtraits they will be reduced
thereby: Since the Preſence of thoſe people will
oblige them either to carry things after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than they have done hitherto, or will make them
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57465:91"/>
infamous to the whole World; neither was it any
thing but this, that occaſioned the Council's having
met ſo frequently as it has done: So that we may
very well have People coming hither, when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
is drawing near its End.</p>
               <p>5. They imagine that by delays, and gaining of
time, they may compaſs their Ends; and that the
Council being once ſuſpended, ſome accident or
other may intervene, which may hinder it from ever
meeting any more; or that God, as ſome wiſh, may
take away his Majeſty, which I truſt in his Mercy
he will not do, his Life, at this time, being of ſo
great importance to the Church, and to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Becauſe if they ſhould put an End to the
Council, though they ſhould be able to do it in a
ſhort time, yet they cannot tell how it might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
or whether the Pope might not be thereby
hindred, from doing what he judgeth to be moſt
convenient for himſelf and his Court; and if, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that time, there ſhould happen to be a vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Holy See, whether the Council might
not intermeddle therein, with more vigor and juſtice,
than it did the laſt time, by reaſon of the doubts
and differences which were then on foot. Now they
reckon they ſhall be freed from that danger by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending
the Council, which will, in effect, be
the ſame as to diſſolve it; and the Cardinals will,
for their own intereſts, be ſure to further a thing
wherein, if there ſhould be a vacancy, the Papacy is
ſo much concerned.</p>
               <p>For theſe and other Reaſons it is, that the Pope
and his Miniſters are ſo deſirous of having the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
ſuſpended; nevertheleſs, that they may not break
with his Majeſty, nor ſeem to have done it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they do not deſire to appear to have been the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57465:92"/>
Authors of it, and would have it thrown upon his
Majeſty; being, ſo far as I can perceive, in great
hopes, that the Electors growing ſick of the great
charge they are at here, will be for going home in
a ſhort time; neither are the Legate and Preſidents
leſs deſirous of having that done, on account of their
own private intereſts.</p>
               <p>The Elector's deſign in this, I mean thoſe of
<hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Triers:</hi> For as for <hi>Cologne,</hi> who is an
extraordinary Perſon, he referrs himſelf intirely to
his Majeſty, is of another nature; who being ſuch
great Princes and Prelates, and Servants of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
are willing to return home to look after their
own particular Concerns; the Rumours they hear of
the Tumults in <hi>Germany,</hi> making them judge it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that the Council ſhould be ſuſpended; and
the rather, becauſe without the concurrence of
<hi>France</hi> they reckon a Council cannot be celebrated
to any purpoſe; or ſo as to be received by the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi>
This makes them to be very earneſt to be
gone; and it is probable they are at this very time
ſolliciting to have leave.</p>
               <p>What remains to be conſidered, is, Whether it
will be as convenient for his Majeſty, as for the
Pope, to have the Council ſuſpended; conſidering
the preſent poſture of Affairs, and the Rumours of
<hi>Germany:</hi> It appearing to be to little purpoſe to
hold a Council for that Province, which will never
make ſuch a Reformation as is neceſſary, and that
too without the concurrence of <hi>France:</hi> Moreover,
it cannot be for his Majeſty's honour that a Council
ſhould end as this will in all probability, and that in
a ſhort time: I ſay, this may make it appear to be
the wiſer courſe to have the Council put off to a
better time, than for to have his Majeſty involve
himſelf in new difficulties. This, and divers other
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57465:92"/>
things, muſt be well underſtood by ſuch as obſerve
them with zeal and prudence, and as are deſirous to
direct and ſerve his Majeſty; as to which, I am ſure
I am not wanting. Now this being ſuppoſed to be
a buſineſs of great moment, and that has conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
difficulties and inconveniencies on both ſides, that
muſt make my judgment about it, to be conditional;
and ſo far doubtfull, as to reckon that That will be
moſt expedient, which his Majeſty ſhall command,
and which ſhall ſeem to be ſo to your Lordſhip;
which, what-ever it is, I ſhall always approve and
follow.</p>
               <p>What I have to offer, if no new Matters or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
do ariſe, which may require the taking of
new Meaſures in reference to the Affairs of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
or if no other Methods ſhould be found out, or
if there be no Secrets, as there are commonly with
Princes, which may perſuade the contrary; I ſay,
what I have to offer under all theſe Reſtrictions, is,
That this is not a time to admit, or ſo much as to
ſpeak of a Suſpenſion; it being much more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
notwithſtanding all the difficulties and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
in <hi>Germany,</hi> to have the Council proſecuted;
and ſince the Council cannot be ſuſpended without
going backward, in the preſent ſtate of affairs, this
ſeems to be the beſt deciſion of the doubt. Since the
ſuſpenſion thereof, if I am not deceived, will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with inconveniencies that are greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all compariſon, than the proſecution thereof
will be; notwithſtanding it ſhould make no ſuch
Reformation as is pretended, and is neceſſary, our
ſins, and the iniquity of the times, not giving way
to it. In which caſe, I ſtill ſpeak ſo, as upon no
terms whatſoever to give way to the Pope and his
Miniſters deforming, under a pretence of reforming,
for to canonize Abuſes: and doing all the miſchiefs
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57465:93"/>
I have formerly taken notice of at large to your
Lordſhip; in none of which, from the beginning, I
have been overſeen or deceived. And as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
as your Lordſhip very well knows, urged theſe
matters, ſo I do it ſtill with greater inſtance.</p>
               <p>Now the thing that is chiefly to be attended to
herein, is, the End of this Suſpenſion both at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and for the future; the End, as the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
has it, being what moves the Agent. To this
we muſt apply what has been above noted; <hi>viz.</hi> That
as it is for the Service of God, that the Council,
inſtead of doing good, ſhould not be ſuffered to do
miſchief: So it is likewiſe for his Majeſty's honour,
that it ſhould not end, as we have reaſon to fear it
will, which may make it ſeem adviſable to give way
to its being ſuſpended or put off to a more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
time.</p>
               <p>This is really ſuch a difficulty, that I do not well
know what to ſay to it; only that it would have
been a happy thing that this Council had never met,
which is no more than what I have often wiſhed and
declared, by reaſon of the many miſchiefs it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done, and is ſtill doing: But there is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
what is once done, unleſs thoſe people could
be brought to recant, which they will never be
brought to, though you ſhould cut their Throats
for refuſing; and as it is to no purpoſe to think of
that, ſo it is to as little purpoſe either in this or any
following Age to hope for any thing of a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from a General Council, or for to ſee any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Order therein, than there is in this; no, not
though the <hi>French</hi> and all other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes
were agreed, it not being to be done without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Schiſm or ſome great Breach, unleſs God
ſhould be pleaſed to remedy things by ſome other
way, or for to work a Miracle; which we have no
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57465:93"/>
reaſon to expect, ſince there is no neceſſity of it;
God having made his Church a perfect Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
by having endued it with Power ſufficient
to remedy all ſuch matters, if through vile Abuſes,
and an inſatiable Thirſt after Empire, ſhe had not
reduced her ſelf to ſuch a ſtate as ſhe is in at preſent,
or if they who ought to watch were not fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep;
and whoſoever ſhall go about to perſuade
himſelf that things are otherwiſe than thus, do's
but deceive himſelf; as they do alſo, that expect
that the World, as it is at this time divided, and
every Prince is gaping and contending after Empire,
that there ſhould ever be a right underſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. <hi>Plato</hi> aſſuring us, that where things
are ſo, it is in vain to hope for Peace: which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be expected, untill all is brought under one
Government. The ſame Truth is confirmed to us
likewiſe by Experience; witneſs the manifold Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which have befallen the World ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the decay of the Empire: Which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
I do not ſee what can be hoped for at this
time or hereafter.</p>
               <p>All this being premiſed, what remains, is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into this matter ſo far as his Majeſty's honour
is concerned therein: Which I do reckon to be ſo
cloſely linked to the Service of God, that there is
no ſeparating them without bringing all to ruine.
What occurrs to me at preſent, why the Council
ought not to be ſuſpended, is,</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe a Suſpenſion is earneſtly purſued by
the Pope and his Miniſters; which, if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, is reaſon enough for his Majeſty's being
againſt it: there being nothing plainer or better
known to the World, than that their Deſigns and
his Majeſty's are quite contrary to one another in
theſe matters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:57465:94"/>
2. Becauſe let a Suſpenſion be brought about as
it will, his Majeſty muſt bear the whole blame of it,
and be charged with all the ill conſequences that
ſhall attend it: For they will be ſure, according to
their old craft, to make it his Majeſty's, and not
his Holineſs's doing.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe the ſuſpending thereof, after it has ſat
ſo many years, and has had ſo many Debates and
Seſſions, will create a great deal of talk, and muſt
make ſport for the Hereticks; who will not fail to
ſay thereupon, That his Majeſty gave way to it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
becauſe he was not able, or did not care to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
the Pope.</p>
               <p>4. Becauſe any Suſpenſion, and eſpecially if it
ſhould be at the next Seſſion, muſt, in my judgment,
tend as much to his Majeſty's diſhonour, as it will
be in favour of the <hi>French,</hi> who cannot be obliged
by any thing ſo much as that; for they will reckon
that their having proteſted againſt the Council both
here and at <hi>Rome,</hi> was what cauſed it to be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
neither will there be much notice taken of its
having been proſecuted for ſome time, after that was
done, ſo long as the <hi>French</hi> have gained their point
at laſt, which was the Suſpenſion of the Council;
ſo that unleſs there ſhould be an extream neceſſity in
relation to God's Service: This alone, in the preſent
ſtate of his Majeſty's affairs, is ſufficient to hinder
him from giving his conſent to its being done.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If there ſhould be a Suſpenſion, it will
be neceſſary that ſome Prelates ſhould ſtill remain
here, who, if they ſhould be all <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in <hi>Spain</hi> will be left deſolate; neither will their
remaining here ſignifie any thing, if they are not a
conſiderable Number: Beſides, as when-ever that
happens, it will undoubtedly involve his Majeſty in
new Troubles and Engagements, ſo it will not be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57465:94"/>
poſſible to aſſemble the Church ſo again; or if that
could be done, there will then be no more ground,
but rather leſs to hope for any thing of Reformation
than there is at preſent, ſince people will be quite
tired out with the length of it. We ought not
therefore to deceive our ſelves, by promiſing our ſelves
things, which no humane Prudence will ſuffer us to
hope for.</p>
               <p>Having taken notice of the inconveniencies which
will attend the ſuſpending of the Council: I come
now to ſet down the Advantages which will accrue
to his Majeſty by having it proſecuted, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it ſhould not make ſuch a Reformation as
is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Now in all that I offer on this Head, I do ſtill
ſuppoſe, that his Majeſty will, as he has done hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
ſtill continue to ſollicit his Holineſs by all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Offices, that things may not be carried here at
ſuch a ſcandalous rate as they have been hitherto;
and that he will take care that no occaſion be given
to the Council for to diſperſe it ſelf, upon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late's
ſpeaking their Minds freely, or denying their
conſent to ſuch matters as are not convenient, which
is a thing that may very juſtly be feared.</p>
               <p>The firſt Advantage is, That ſince the times will
not give way to more, a Council will ſtill have been
celebrated by his Majeſty: And in having done that,
notwithſtanding all the Diſputes, Wars and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the contrary, his Majeſty will have gained
his main Point; and there will be but few who will
know the truth of matters, and eſpecially in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Ages.</p>
               <p>2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Though there ſhould not be ſuch a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in all things as is neceſſary, there will be in all
matters of Doctrine; and it will be a great Point
to have all ſuch matters decreed and made perpetual:
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57465:95"/>
For ſuppoſe the Hereticks ſhould ſeek out flaws in
the Council to excuſe their not receiving it, that
will be no new thing; and it is probable they would
do the ſame, if the whole Church were reformed;
but they will not laſt long, after the Church has
done all that was in her power: For after this is
once done, his Majeſty, and other <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes,
will have wherewith to compell the Hereticks, when
any good juncture ſhall happen, or when they ſhall
judge it to be convenient: And for other things,
Remedies may be found for them.</p>
               <p>3. After the Council has done all it can as to
Doctrines, if through the oppoſition of the Pope
and his Miniſters a Reformation cannot be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which I do verily believe they will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to, neither in a Council nor out of one: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that his Majeſty will, by what he has done,
have diſcharged a great Duty; he will alſo be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
able to juſtifie his calling Provincial Councils,
and his making uſe of all other juſt and pious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
for the remedying and reforming of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
than he would be otherwiſe: That being no
more than what has been done formerly, and may,
in the judgment of all pious and learned Men, be
repeated again.</p>
               <p>4. By how much the War goes on increaſing,
there is the greater neceſſity of the Council's being
continued, in order to the proſecuting of one of the
chief Ends for which it was aſſembled; which was
the making of Peace among all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes:
For which, and ſeveral other good Reaſons, it is no
way convenient, that the Council ſhould be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
for beſides, that to ſuſpend it, is in effect the
ſame as to diſſolve it; ſo in caſe of a vacancy of the
See, and of ſeveral other things, it will be expedient
the Council ſhould be kept on foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:57465:95"/>
Laſtly, To continue the Council till the War is
at an end, is of great moment; that being, in my
judgment, one of the beſt means his Majeſty can make
uſe of to keep the Pope, whoſe friendſhip at this
time is ſo neceſſary, firm to his Ingagements: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
evident from the uſual inconſtancy and mutabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that Court, and from ſeveral other things,
which are well known to your Lordſhip, of how
great importance it has been to the Service of God,
and to the publick Good, that the Pope has been
obliged to preſerve this Union.</p>
               <p>But if, after all that has been ſaid, his Majeſty
ſhould be compelled either thorough the Changes
and Tumults of <hi>Germany,</hi> or the War in <hi>Italy,</hi> or
the Departure of the Electors, upon its being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for them to repair home, or for ſome other
Reaſons to conſent to a Suſpenſion; it will then be
convenient to conſider, Whether the time of the
Suſpenſion ought not to be limited, which I take to
be a thing of great importance.</p>
               <p>But if upon what is here repreſented, a Reſolution
ſhould be taken to have the Council continued, ſo as
not to ſuffer the Suſpenſion thereof to be ſo much as
mentioned; we are then to conſider, when it will be
convenient it ſhould end; which is a thing his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
muſt be ſure to take care of, and to ſee that
That be ſo ordered, as may beſt ſuit with his affairs;
and the Elector's occaſions, upon whoſe Preſence here
very much depends; as alſo whether the Proteſtants
will come or not; and whether it may be convenient,
that the Atricle <hi>de Communione ſub utraque ſpecie,</hi>
which is now ſuſpended, ſhould be determined in the
next Seſſion; which ought not to be, no nor that of
the Marriage of Prieſts neither: both which ought
to be put off to the very laſt Seſſion. In which, by
what I can perceive, and his Majeſty muſt ſee it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57465:96"/>
likewiſe, there will be trouble enough, through the
Pope's labouring all he can for ſeveral weighty Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
to have the Council quite locked up; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it may not be moſt convenient to leave thoſe
Articles to be determined by another Council, which
may be named, though it were never to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that ſo there may ſtill be a door left open, and
ſomething that is diſpenſable for the publick Good;
of which nature all ſuch things are, as are not of
Faith: For who knows but <hi>Germany</hi> may come to
be in ſuch a ſtate, that theſe things may ſuffice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it, as it did in the caſe of the <hi>Bohemians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſince there is no likelihood of the Council's
not ending after the ſame faſhion, as it has proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
Beſides, that it will be for his Majeſty's honour
that thoſe Articles ſhould not be determined, it will
likewiſe prevent his Majeſty's being compelled to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
thoſe Decrees of the Council before he is ready
for it; and may alſo prevent the <hi>Lutherans</hi> being ſo
far irritated and provoked as to liſten to the Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the <hi>French;</hi> which is a thing ought to be
carefully looked after.</p>
               <p>May our Lord direct all things, as he knows to
be moſt needfull, and guide his Majeſty, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
himſelf wholly in his Service, into what is
moſt convenient; and may he likewiſe preſerve and
proſper your Lordſhip's moſt Illuſtrious and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Perſon and State for many years, as I deſire.</p>

               <p>THree days agoe I writ your Lordſhip my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
at large concerning what we are doing
here, to which I have little to add, only, that tho'
I have thought much on theſe Affairs, yet conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
they are matters of great Importance, and there
are great Inconveniencies on all ſides, it is poſſible I
may be miſtaken in them; ſo that as I have ſaid
formerly, I ſhall then reckon my Judgment of them,
ſomething, when I ſhall underſtand that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
eſteems it ſo.</p>
               <p>The Electors of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> ſeem to be
fully determined to leave this place, ſo ſoon as they
have received his Majeſty's Anſwer, which <hi>Don
Franciſco</hi> has promiſed they ſhall have in a few days;
who, though they are both Prelates of great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
are much out in this matter, and will be
more ſo, if they ſhould go without his Majeſty's
leave: For it has made a wonderfull change in the
Synod, they who are glad of it, whom we need not
name, talking thereof, and reporting it after ſuch a
manner, as plainly diſcovers what they have in their
Hearts; all their talk now being of a Suſpenſion, or
Diſſolution of the Council, and of the Legate's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ready to depart, and of <hi>Pighinus</hi>'s being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

have his Majeſty's Commands immediately, which
though I do not know whether they may be able to

things very much to us.</p>

The Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> who has got great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
here, by having on all occaſions demonſtrated

by the other two, whereas, if he would ſtill
remain here, the other two's going would trouble
us the leſs, who though they pretend Neceſſity, and
to have a good Intention in what they do, have not
conſidered this Affair as they ought to have done,
and how great a Change it would make here, and
how prejudicial it might be to his Majeſty's Affairs
in this preſent juncture; and how the <hi>French,</hi> who

repreſented to your Lordſhip, the Perſon, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and Services of the Biſhop of <hi>Venoſa,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
what he did at <hi>Bononia,</hi> and afterwards in
this place, where he continued two Years, till he
was called away by the Cardinal <hi>Jaen,</hi> who aſſured
him it was for his Majeſty's ſervice, for the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
whereof he is now returned hither again; and
who being a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the Son of <hi>Spaniards</hi> who
were Servants to his Majeſty, he cannot endure his
preſent Biſhoprick, which is at the proviſion of the
Pope, and which I ſuppoſe he deſigns, for juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

for to do much. I do therefore moſt affectionately
intreat your Lordſhip for to prevail with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
to beſtow one of the two Churches that are now
vacant in the Kingdom upon him; they are the
Churches of <hi>Aguila</hi> and <hi>Cotron,</hi> and are worth 700

a great deal more, it will be taken well by every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

do this Favour to all, and to me in particular, I
will ſay no more, only that if we did any thing when

to it: Nevertheleſs, he is at preſent in a great
ſtreight, the ſight of his Majeſty's determination
having filled him with fears, the ſuſpenſion he had
ſet his heart on ſo much being thereby defeated, the
Synod being to go on; beſides, things are not ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in <hi>Germany,</hi> as ſome people deſired; and the
Electors are to remain here, and the Proteſtants do
intend to come to this place: Which laſt, is a thing
the Pope and his Miniſters are not able to diſſemble
their being diſpleaſed withall; who though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell what they may do, I am certain I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
writ it to your Lordſhip, that they will never
do any thing to any purpoſe, if not ſoundly preſſed
and terrify'd into it. I pray God that may be able
to do it, that we may have no more ſtrugling with
them.</p>
               <p>As to the matter of Benefices with Cure, <hi>Janus</hi>
has writ that his Majeſty, ſo that they be but well
ordered, will be ſatisfy'd without having them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be Patrimonial; and whereas the Legate
gives out, that his Majeſty has ſome deſign therein;
it is certain he himſelf has one, and that is very well
accommodated to the doing of nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and who will reckon he has carried his Point,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57465:99"/>
if the drawing up of that affair be left to him, for
he will be ſure to lodge the proviſion to them in the
Pope, and abounding with words and ſophiſtry, will
open a brave field for the future. <hi>Don Franciſco</hi>
muſt have writ at large concerning this matter; all
that I have to ſay thereon is, what I have formerly
writ to your Lordſhip, which is that I am not,
nor will ever be for having matters of ſo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and whereon ſo much depends, handled
and eſtabliſhed after ſuch a manner, which would
have no other effect, but to ſhut a door for ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all future remedies. Whereas it is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for us to ſuffer our preſent Grievances to remain
as they are, and to wait for the Remedies which
God at ſome time or other will help us to, than by
being diſcontented with them, to ſhut a door againſt
them by thoſe inſignificant things the Legate has in
his thoughts, which, ſo far as I can perceive, are
contrary to the things his Majeſty deſires, and as is
plain from a Letter I have ſeen that was writ to
<hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> to what it is ſaid he told <hi>Janus.</hi>
Wherefore if your Lordſhip is not of another opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
the thing to be done, in my mind, is, That his
Majeſty muſt inſiſt on having Benefices declared to
be Patrimonial, without deſcending to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
which if it cannot be done in this Seſſion, the
Legate muſt be ſpoke to, to adjourn it to the next,
that we may have the more time to treat about it,
and may obtain more from the Pope than we can
expect to have from the Legate. It will likewiſe
be neceſſary, before we come to treat thereof again,
to conſider well what courſe we are to take therein;
for notwithſtanding the Prelates are all honeſt Men,
and of great Zeal; nevertheleſs if we do not take
care to prevent it, we ſhall have the Legate ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them with things which many of them do not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57465:99"/>
underſtand, and others cannot fall into the account
of in ſo ſhort a time as the Legate will allow them,
who puts every thing off to the Veſpers of the
Seſſion.</p>
               <p>It is furthermore convenient, that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
now to conſider, what will be fit to be done at
the end of the Synod, whenever it ſhall happen, and
to provide againſt Accidents, and particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſome things that relate to the Authority of
the Council and his Majeſty's Service: About which,
as I ſhall not fail to employ my Thoughts, ſo I ſhall
at ſometime or other acquaint your Lordſhip there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
whoſe moſt Illuſtrious and Reverend Perſon
and State may God protect and proſper for many
years, as I deſire.</p>

               <p>I Writ yeſterday to your Lordſhip, as I do now
again in haſte, referring you to what <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco</hi>
has writ concerning the whole Buſineſs, and
particularly about the Speech that was made this
Morning by Duke <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Embaſſadors, who ſpoke
with much more freedom, than the Pope and his
Miniſters would have had them to have done: It is
to be feared, that if thoſe Embaſſadors do inſiſt on
their Pretenſions, that ſuch a Rupture will follow
thereupon, as will oblige them to depart, and hinder
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57465:100"/>
the other Proteſtants from coming hither, with
which the Legate will be very well pleaſed, only he
do's not care that the ſcandal thereof ſhould fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Pope and his Miniſters: It will be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
therefore, that we ſhould make it plain to all
the World, that his Majeſty was no ways acceſſary
to it, as I writ to your Lordſhip on the 20th of the
laſt Month. We muſt therefore do all that we are
able to prevent it, that ſo we may ſee what ſort of
Reformation the Pope will be pleaſed to give us,
though, as I have often writ to you, I have little
hopes of ever ſeeing any good done either by him or
his Legate; neither do I ſee any cauſe to change my
Thoughts of them. As for the Legate, he will do
all that he is able, to hinder the granting of ſuch a
ſafe Conduct as is deſired; and before he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
any thing, he will be ſure to conſult the Pope
about it.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip may now judge whether I was
much miſtaken in the account I gave you of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate's
having got the Seal into his poſſeſſion, with
which he do's not care to truſt the Synod; than
which, as nothing in the World can be more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
ſo it lets every-body ſee, that the Synod is
not for to exerciſe any authority: And whereas the
Legates were formerly earneſt for to have the Synod
return an Anſwer to the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;</hi>
now they do not care they ſhould write to any
body, neither do I ſee how they can do it, now the
Legate has got the Seal into his poſſeſſion; for let
them write to whom they will, he will never let them
have the Seal, <hi>As the Univerſal Church aſſembled.</hi>
Now ſhould the Proteſtants fall into the account of
this, as I do believe they will, I do not know what
Effects the want of that Title may have in the ſafe
Conduct: It is therefore neceſſary that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57465:100"/>
ſhould order what is moſt convenient, and that
the Legate be acquainted with his determination.</p>
               <p>As to what remains, having it before my Eyes,
as I have formerly writ, that this Synod muſt end
tumultuouſly and ingloriouſly, for that reaſon, and
for the ſecurity of his Majeſty's honour, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that we ſhould be provided, againſt what may
happen; concerning which, after this Seſſion is over,
I ſhall write what occurrs to me: As to <hi>Maurice</hi>'s
Embaſſadors pretending, that the Biſhops ought to
be Abſolved from the Oath they have taken to the
Pope, and that the Pope ought to ſubmit himſelf
to the Council; I have ſaid privately, they have no
good intention therein, but do deſign thereby to
maintain their Hereſie. Now if the Pope would
but yield to this as it is reaſonable he ſhould, ſuch
a courſe might be taken, that he ſhould ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
thereby, and the Proteſtants would then be
left without excuſe. But this is a thing not to be
expected; for the Pope and his Miniſters will ſooner
ſuffer their Throats to be cut, than part with an
inch of their Pretenſions; ſo that if we do end in a
Tragedy, it will not be a thing to be wondred at.
I ſhall not fail to give an account of all that paſſeth
to your Lordſhip, whoſe moſt Illuſtrious and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Perſon and State, may God preſerve and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
for many years, as I deſire.</p>

               <p>WE are ſtrangely embroiled by the Legate, who
ſeeing the Embaſſadors of <hi>Maurice,</hi> and of
the other Princes here; and hearing there are more
on their way, his Soul is ready to leap out of his
Body, to ſend thoſe that are here home, and to
keep the others from coming: To which end he is,
to our great trouble, daily ſtarting new Difficulties
and Delays concerning thoſe of <hi>Wirtembourg</hi> and
<hi>Strasbourg;</hi> who, if they would depart, would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
him very much, that being the thing he is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at, being ſenſible, that by giving an Audience
to thoſe Embaſſadors, which he cannot now well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
he ſhall open a door to the reſt, a thing both
his Maſter and he do abhorr the thoughts of, and
are doing all they can to hinder; to which purpoſe
he is continually ſtarting new Difficulties about the
ſafe Conduct, denying the Seal alſo to the Council,
which is never to uſe it, but when he ſhall think fit,
and doing it after ſuch a manner, as aſtoniſheth
every body that obſerves it. <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> has preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him very hard to have it diſpatched in this
Month, but he takes little notice of what he ſays
to him; and is ſo much diſordered, as not to ſeem
to value the Proteſtants one farthing.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, he is extreamly ſollicitous to have
the Seſſion ſuſpended; and ſhould he ſo manage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
as to have it done at his Majeſty's requeſt, it
will be his Maſter-piece: There is no doubt to be
made of this being the thing he aims at, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57465:101"/>
therein is quite different from that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
though they may both have the ſame iſſue;
it being notorious that the thing he drives at, is to
prepare a way for his ſo much deſired Suſpenſion;
after which the Council would quickly break up,
and the Proteſtants, who are on their way, would
return home, to his great ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> and I have had ſeveral Conſults
about this, and ſome other Affairs; an account
whereof he muſt have writ to you; as alſo of his
deſiring to have leave, in caſe they ſhould ſuſpend
the Council, to proteſt in his Majeſty's Name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it. The Caſe is diſjunctive, thus: Should they
ſuſpend the Seſſion at the requeſt of his Majeſty,
and the Council ſhould happen afterwards to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
thereupon, or ſome new Difficulties ſhould
ariſe, they will in that caſe be ſure to throw all the
blame upon his Majeſty, as they have always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to do. On the other hand, Should his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
order the Seſſion to be celebrated at the time
appointed, and the Proteſtants who were to follow
the Embaſſadors of <hi>Maurice,</hi> ſhould not be arrived;
in that caſe they will not fail to put his Majeſty in
the wrong.</p>
               <p>Being ſenſible that this is their Plot, I acquainted
<hi>Don Franciſco</hi> with it, as I did alſo with my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
about it; which is, That his Majeſty ſhould
do neither the one nor the other, but ſhould leave
it to the Proteſtants, who have not as yet deſired
any thing of the Council to Petition for it: And
as it would be a happy thing if the Legate would
but give them the hearing in ſuch a caſe; ſo if they
are to do it, it is neceſſary that his Majeſty ſhould
ſpeedily acquaint us with what he would have done
in this affair; as alſo in the buſineſs of the Elector
of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> whoſe Envoys, as <hi>Don Franciſco</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:57465:102"/>
muſt have writ, do begin to talk of returning home;
which they will certainly do, if their buſineſs is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
much longer.</p>
               <p>As to the Seal, which the Legate denies to give
to the Synod; as it is a prodigious thing, ſo I think
it is abſolutely neceſſary to have it remedied; for
beſides, that the Proteſtants will undoubtedly lay
hold thereof, it is in it ſelf ſo great nonſenſe, for
it deſerves no better title, as ought not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
               <p>As to the affair of Benefices, <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> has
with much ado prevailed with the Legate, not to
propoſe what he intended, at the next Seſſion. This
is a thing that gives me no ſmall trouble; for I do
ſee plainly, that the Legate is taking that courſe
to compaſs it, I formerly hinted to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>But the thing, of all others, that gives me the
moſt trouble, is the Legate's pretending, that he
is informed by <hi>Janus,</hi> that his Majeſty is contented
to have the Affair ſetled as the Legate would have
it; notwithſtanding the contrary plainly appears
from his Majeſty's laſt Diſpatch, about which I had
taken ſo much pains; his Majeſty having therein
by no means allowed, that the Proviſions to Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
with Cure ſhould be lodged in the Pope: His
Majeſty's meaning in thoſe words, <hi>That they ſhall
conſider, treat of, and conclude ſome way,</hi> &amp;c. and that
they ſhall be given to ſuch as are worthy, being, that
it ſhall be done by ſome way, if it is poſſible, that is
equivalent to their being made Patrimonial, by a
mature Conſideration and Diſcuſſion of the Matter.
Now in caſe they were to be lodged wholly in the
Pope, and the Settlement thereof were to be worded
according to the Legate's interpretation of <hi>Janus</hi>'s
Letter, there would then be no need of treating or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57465:102"/>
concluding any thing about it, which his Majeſty
has ordered to be done; for it would certainly be
both the moſt ſenſeleſs and prejudicial thing that
ever was paſſed; as I have formerly declared, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
oppoſed the Legate in what he would have
done therein; having likewiſe writ my Thoughts
thereof to your Lordſhip, his Majeſty having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to do ſo when there ſhould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Finally, This Point we are on at preſent, is the
moſt ſubſtantial and dangerous thing that can be as
to the coming and departing of Proteſtants, as to
the doing of any thing here to the purpoſe, and as
to his Majeſty's compaſſing his Ends, and reaping
ſome fruit of his great Labours, and as to the rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and diſgracing of all. But let things go as
they will, I ſhall have this comfort, That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
if they do not go well, will be no ways acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to it, and that it will be manifeſt to God and
the whole World, that it was the Pope and his
Miniſters having endeavoured to engroſs all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
without having any regard to the remedying
of what is amiſs, that has been the Cauſe of it;
which Remedy may God himſelf give to his Church,
and preſerve and proſper your moſt Illuſtrious and
Reverend Perſon and State for many years, as I
deſire.</p>

               <p>THE Seſſion has been celebrated with the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion
of the Doctrines, but without doing
any thing in the buſineſs of Reformation: It being
impoſſible to come to a concluſion with the Legate,
about any thing of that kind; which, conſidering
how he manages and carries Matters here, I do rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
to be no great damage.</p>
               <p>The Legate has at laſt pronounced the ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and your Lordſhip will eaſily imagine what
pains we have been at to bring him to it: He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to add ſome Clauſes, and take away others,
which coſt us a great deal of trouble: Inſomuch
that we do reckon that we have done a mighty Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
in having procured it in the form you ſee it
in, and, in truth, we were very near having come
to a Rupture with him about it. I pray God the
Proteſtants may be ſatisfy'd with it, ſince abating
ſome things which were not convenient, and others
we were forced to qualifie, becauſe there was no
poſſibility of perſuading the Legate to yield to them;
particularly that concerning the free Exerciſe of their
Rites, which was by his Majeſty's Order ſo qualify'd,
as only to amount to a Toleration, ſo as not to be
liable to be puniſhed for any Exceſſes in the Matters
of their Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but without granting them
an expreſs Licenſe, as the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> did to the
<hi>Bohemians;</hi> as alſo the manner how they were to
handle their Controverſies; for there being no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of bringing the Legate to admit of that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57465:103"/>
Clauſe of the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> we were out of pure
neceſſity forced to let it paſs as it is, which I hope
will give content, it being ſaid, <hi>Et ſignanter quod
cauſae controverſae tractentur;</hi> which as it implies
as much as the Proteſtants deſired, ſo in having
uſed only the word <hi>tractentur,</hi> they will not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
thereby to ſubmit to the Decrees of the Pope,
or to any ſuch matters; there did not want thoſe
who were very earneſt, to have had the word <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centur</hi>
added; which would have extreamly exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the Proteſtants, becauſe thereby the Council
would have been made their Judges; which was all
that the Legate ever pretended to: But this, and
ſeveral other ſuch things, were oppoſed by thoſe of
our Party, Dr. <hi>Malvenda,</hi> notwithſtanding his indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
behaving himſelf therein to admiration:
I ſay, theſe Particulars abated, this ſafe Conduct is
the ſubſtance of all that they deſired, and the ſame
with that of <hi>Baſil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After we had overcome theſe, and ſeveral other
Difficulties, the Legate was for having the Clauſe,
that contained the Pope's promiſe for to run thus:
<hi>Pro ſanctiſſimo Domino noſtro;</hi> about which, after
there had been a great deal of ſtir, at laſt we agreed
that neither the Pope nor his Majeſty ſhould be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in it, but that it ſhould run thus: <hi>Pro princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibus
tam eccleſiaſticis quam ſecularibus;</hi> ſo that it
was the Eve of the Seſſion before we came to an
agreement how it was to be, the Legate having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
upon having the words <hi>quantum in nobis eſt</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the Clauſe of Security, which we got by pure
dint of Reaſon to be left out.</p>
               <p>This is all that relates to the ſafe Conduct,
which, in point of ſecurity, and other things, is as
full as the Proteſtants can deſire to have it; unleſs
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57465:104"/>
to juſtifie their pretences, they are for finding flaws
in every thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> has taken a great deal of pains to
ſatisfie Duke <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Envoys, but to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
who do ſtill inſiſt on this, That they cannot
exceed their Commiſſion, in yielding to the change
of one Title, in the ſafe Conduct of <hi>Baſil:</hi> His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
muſt be pleaſed to concern himſelf in this, and
not for to ſuffer all to depend on thoſe to whom he
gave but little ſafe Conduct for what they did yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
in the General Congregation, in which they
propoſed all that they had given in before to our
Embaſſadors, with the addition of ſome other bold
things.</p>
               <p>In the Congregation that was held yeſterday, and
in that of this morning, the Envoys of <hi>Wirtembourg</hi>
having preſented their Powers, deliver'd in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
a Book of their Confeſſion, and certain Heads
of their Pretenſions; a Copy whereof I do here ſend
your Lordſhip: It would be a large Hiſtory to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
all that has paſſed with the Legate, before we
could get him to admit theſe people; of which
<hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> who did, and is ſtill doing all that is
poſſible, muſt have writ at large: for, the truth is,
we had a very hard tug of it.</p>
               <p>As for the Legate, ſince his having heard the
Propoſitions which were made and ſpoke to by the
Envoys, he do's things that are aſtoniſhing; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that he made the Synod before they were heard
for to enter a Proteſtation, of which I here ſend
your Lordſhip a Copy, he would needs have had it
repeated again at the publick Seſſion, till I convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him of the inconveniency thereof, as I did alſo
of ſeveral other things, by telling him that it would
be much better to let the doing of it after ſuch a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57465:104"/>
manner alone, and not to add any Clauſe to it that
was odious; which I obtained of him, and ſo it
paſſed as it is. With this I do reckon the War is
actually begun; for that after the granting of this
ſafe Conduct, and the ſecurity it promiſeth, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi>
and his Companions, will have nothing to
plead in excuſe for their not coming hither, and
that ſpeedily too, the next Seſſion being ordered to
be held on the 15th of <hi>March;</hi> after which time I
believe it will be impoſſible for us, without breaking
with the Pope, to obtain a longer term, he and his
Miniſters being in a terrible fright thorow their
imagining, that our aim in theſe delays is to procure
a Reformation: But as I was always ſatisfy'd of
what was his Majeſty's intentions therein, I was
much more ſo by his laſt Letters concerning this
delay and the next Seſſion. On the 20th Inſtant I
acquainted your Lordſhip with what had paſſed
here, in reference to the Doctrine of Order, and
with ſome Clauſes being therein, that are extreamly
prejudicial to the Church, in general, and in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
to the Rights of Biſhops, Proviſions of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
and the Dignities and Patronages that belong
to Princes in Cathedral Churches, and, above all,
to his Majeſty. The Clauſe which deſtroys all theſe,
and both condemns the Primitive Church, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs
all Remedies for the future, I do here ſend
your Lordſhip, as I do alſo the whole Doctrine,
which has ſeveral ſuch pernicious Clauſes in it; to
all which I have ſet a mark. Now as I do not think
there is any thing of greater importance than this is,
ſo it is viſible the Legate has ſet his heart extreamly
upon it, and is very angry with the Prelates for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aware thereof; and who for that reaſon finding,
that he ſhould not be able to paſs it in the hurry of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57465:105"/>
a Seſſion, he has ordered the Doctrines to be put
to the Vote the next day after to morrow, his Soul
being ready to leap out of his Body to carry this
Point, with all its pernicious conſequences; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the chief is, That all Power will be given to the
Pope. I have already advertiſed <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
who is prepared to do all that he is able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it; Nevertheleſs, I am ſtill afraid that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
may carry this point, he having boaſted already
that he has given more to the Apoſtolical See, than
was ever given to it by any that were before him.
But beſides what has been ſaid of the importance of
theſe matters, their having never been diſcuſſed or
propoſed muſt be inſiſted on, to put a ſtop to the
Legate; who if ſuffered to do it in this, may take
the ſame courſe in all other things; for ſince theſe
matters have been ſuſpended till ſuch time as the
Proteſtants have been heard, there is no reaſon why
they ſhould be concluded and agreed on by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
before that has been done, ſince that muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
the Suſpenſion, and the Proteſtants will be heard
in a Cauſe that is pre-judged. Now all that can
be done here, ſerves only to gain time; the Remedy
being to be had no-where but at <hi>Rome,</hi> where his
Majeſty muſt do all he can with the Pope, to put a
ſtop to this buſineſs: God grant he may ſucceed in
it. For I can ſee ſuch things preparing, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we will be content to ſuffer great Miſchiefs to
be done both to the Church and his Majeſty, this
Synod muſt end in a Tragedy: And what a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing is this, that in ſuch a Prince's time, ſuch
things as theſe ſhould be ſuffered to be carried on
with ſo great Violence, by the Legate, who affronts
and threatens all that have the courage to oppoſe
him in any thing, and who, the other day, called
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57465:105"/>
the Biſhop of <hi>Oren</hi> an Heretick: For my own part,
I cannot imagine how ſuch Exceſſes as theſe come
to be endured, unleſs it be for our greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
               <p>It would be a long work to lay open the Reaſons
and Ground of all theſe Matters; but your Lordſhip,
who has ſo quick an inſight into things, will, from
what I have writ here, and on other occaſions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what my Thoughts are of them; and will
ſee, that a ſhort and ſpeedy Remedy is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the things we are here toiling about: For
the obtaining whereof, and that I might give your
Lordſhip an account of all that paſſeth here, was
what diſpoſed me to write ſo much at this time,
when a multitude of Troubles and Buſineſs do ſo
oppreſs me, as will ſcarce allow me time to breathe
in, to the endangering of my health.</p>
               <p>I forgot to tell you that the Legate being obliged
to it by the great noiſe it made, has ſo far quitted
the Clauſe, which would have given to the Pope a
ſuperiority over Councils, as to temper it, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
only <hi>uno,</hi> for <hi>unico &amp; ſupremo capite;</hi> whereas
it ought entirely to have been left out, as an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and unſeaſonable thing at this time, and in this
place; for what occaſion is there in the treating and
diſcuſſing the Doctrine of Order, to make any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Juriſdiction; and what can be more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
than to be always thus inculcating the Pope's
power; which, though great, is not ſuch as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
pretends it is: For which reaſon the Legate
would not ſuffer, nor ſo much as hear, of the Name
of <hi>Baſil</hi> being put in the ſafe Conduct, where it is
ſaid, <hi>Praxis Chriſti &amp; primitivae eccleſiae;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the whole of what was contained in that
paſſage, is put into it. I ſhall not fail, according
to my duty, to adviſe your Lordſhip of all that is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57465:106"/>
done here, whoſe moſt Illuſtrious and Reverend

honourable Employment; I know the Preſidents,

               </opener>
               <p>HIS Majeſty's Diſpatch is juſt now arrived, and
is as full as was neceſſary, or as I could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
or as might be expected, coming thorow your
Lordſhip's hands. <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> after our having
had ſome diſcourſe together about the execution
thereof, immediately diſpatched away this Expreſs,
which is in ſuch haſt, as will not ſuffer me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large;
neither is it neceſſary I ſhould, ſince <hi>Don
Franciſco</hi> has done it.</p>
               <p>I am, and that for good reaſons, extreamly ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
to know what his Majeſty would have done
in caſe the Legate ſhould not be perſuaded to comply
with what he deſires: For tho' it is true, that he
can have no reaſon for his refuſing to do it, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
continues very obſtinate, ſeeming to be
reſolved, by one way or other, to hinder or avoid
any Congreſs with the Proteſtants: in which affair
we ſhall be ſure to have trouble enough with him.
I pray God it do not end in ſuch a diſturbance, as
he deſires, and is now labouring to raiſe, upon his
being defeated of his ſo much deſired Prorogation,
by his Majeſty's having got the determination of the
Doctrines to be ſuſpended, as it was reaſonable they
ſhould, and that without having the Seſſion put off,
which would have been attended with ſeveral incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
I need not here take notice of, having
ſome days ago acquainted your Lordſhip with
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:57465:107"/>
In caſe the Legate ſhould not be prevailed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
but ſhould perſiſt in his obſtinacy, as he is like
enough to do, and that after a boiſterous manner,
when he once comes to ſee how much the Pope's
and his own Reputation are concerned therein; it
will then be neceſſary for his Majeſty's honour, that
we, on our part, ſhould be ſo provided for a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
as to be able to make it notorious, that his
Majeſty is not to blame for it: For whenever any
ſuch contention ſhall ariſe, in the end, the Pope will
be ſure to throw the fault upon his Majeſty; whom
we ought therefore to take care to vindicate, which
we may do eaſily, and without giving offence, by
keeping our ſelves always upon the Defenſive, or by
having no great regard to the Pope's friendſhip; from
which, if it hangs by ſo ſlender a thread as this is,
we can never expect any great matters: For ſhould
the Synod be interrupted on this occaſion, it will
be of great moment to us, and eſpecially as to the
Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> to make it manifeſt to God and
all the World, that his Majeſty was no ways the
Cauſe of it; whoſe Honour, notwithſtanding his
Endeavours have proved abortive, will be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby. As to the firſt of theſe ways, if it is
taken, we muſt manage it as well as we can with the
Legates: But for the ſecond, we muſt wait till we
have his Majeſty's Anſwer about it; which the
ſooner it comes, the better it will be. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
may be pleaſed to conſider likewiſe, Whether
it would not be convenient, to prepare the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
for to oppoſe the Legate in his deſigns; and
that the Envoys of <hi>Wirtenbourg</hi> and <hi>Strasbourg</hi>
ſhould preſent their Propoſitions in a Congregation,
before the meeting of the Seſſion, that ſo the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
may know the better what they are to inſiſt
on; that in caſe any diſturbance ſhould happen, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57465:107"/>
Inſtruments may be made thereof; that what
is done may not be left in Words, and private Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
with the Legate, who will afterwards be
ſure to deny all, and will ſo diſguiſe things as to
make them appear as he would have them. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore;
if the Legate ſhould, notwithſtanding
all we can do to prevent it, create ſome diſturbance,
either by not holding a Seſſion, or by celebrating
of one, and carrying his Point therein by a majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for I have formerly told your Lordſhip what
Work was going on here; it will then be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
that our Embaſſadors ſhould have a publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
prepared, which ſhall in few words, and
a civil ſtyle, contain the whole force and ſubſtance
of the Buſineſs; which Inſtrument may be delivered
to the Legate and Preſidents, either at their own
Houſes, or in the Synod, at a Congregation, or at
the Seſſion when the Legate ſhall begin to move the
Points he is driving at. It being expedient both
for God and his Majeſty's Service, if this ſhould
come to end in a Tragedy, that there ſhould remain
ſome publick Inſtruments thereof, to teſtifie the
truth of Things, to the preſent and all future Ages.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip may be pleaſed to conſider what
is fit to be done; for whatever your do preſcribe, will
certainly be moſt convenient. I have enlarged more
than the haſte the Currier is in, could well diſpenſe
with. I ſhall ere long give your Lordſhip an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of a Buſineſs you will be aſtoniſhed at, which
is the Legate's having foiſted ſeveral Paſſages into
the Doctrine of Order, which muſt of neceſſity ruine
all: Of which, before I obſerved it, and ſpoke of
it, there was not one that fell into the Account;
and indeed, conſidering how things are managed
here, I do not at all wonder at it. By which
means, and by the brutal Violences, Pretenſions and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57465:108"/>
Obſtinacy of the Legate, things are running into
ſuch a ſtate, as muſt in the end, if I am not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
make both himſelf and the whole Earth for to
tremble; or if it does not make him, it muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he is given over to a reprobate ſenſe, as, in
truth, he ſeems to be abundantly in every thing that
he does: The Lord remedy things, and preſerve

               <p>THis very Afternoon I writ to your Lordſhip;
the reaſon of my now Writing to you again,
is to acquaint your Lordſhip with what they are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
here. <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> has ſpoke to the Legate;
and your Lordſhip may eaſily imagine, that what
paſſed between them was exorbitant and like the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate;
however, they came at laſt to the Concluſion
I mentioned in my former: <hi>Viz.</hi> That the Doctrines
ſhould not be determined; but as to the Canons of
Reformation, the Legate, to this hour, is not to be
perſuaded to pronounce them; that being a Work
he is not at all fond of; and when we deſired him
to take time to conſider of it, and to give us his
Anſwer to morrow; he declared he would not treat
about it any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:57465:108"/>
                  <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> who is very ſincere in his Actings,
has ſince talked with me about it, deſiring to know
what I thought of it. I told him I was of opinion
that it ought to be inſiſted on, ſo as to oblige them
to pronounce the Canons of Reformation, that ſo
his Majeſty's Orders might be obſerved in all things;
and that this might be made a Seſſion, by having
paſſed ſome judicial Acts: As alſo, that we might
defeat the Legate, whoſe drift in all this is to make
way for a Suſpenſion; which, being the deſign of
what he is doing, is a ſufficient Indication of his
having no reaſon on his ſide. Wherefore we are
reſolved to have another pull with him to morrow
about it, and not to give over untill we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
it, if it is poſſible.</p>
               <p>I am ſtill afraid the Legate will compaſs his Ends;
and though they may not determine the Doctrines,
yet that they will finally reſolve them into Canons
by the way of Deputation, which will be much the
ſame. I pray God they may never do it, nor be
ſuffered to pronounce any Doctrines that are ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
or any thing that is not convenient; ſince it
is plain, that all they drive at, is to get all the Pope's
Pretenſions eſtabliſhed, under the Doctrines of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
and ſo, inſtead of healing, to deſtroy and ruine
all: thoſe being Matters which were never ſo much
as propoſed or diſputed on in the Council; neither
is it fitting, as things ſtand here, that they, or any
thing elſe of the ſame nature, ſhould be medled with
in this Synod.</p>
               <p>The Pope's Power, not only as to its Formality,
but as to its Matter and Uſe, is, and has always
been capable of being ſo ordered, as is judged to be
moſt for the Edification of the Church. Now there
are Clauſes put into the Doctrines, which do not
only pretend to condemn ſome Opinions in their
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57465:109"/>
Heretical ſenſe, but in a ſenſe alſo that is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Catholicks: For example; that the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Prieſts, or of the Miniſters of all ſuperiour
and inferiour Orders, is a Sacrament, and belongs
only to Biſhops, is a Catholick Doctrine: Yet
for all that, in the condemning of that Propoſition
of <hi>Luther</hi>'s, That all Men are equally Prieſts; and,
that there is no other Ordination, but that of the
conſent of the People; the Doctrine, That there is
a Right in the People to appoint this or that perſon
to miniſter in a Church, ought not to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
it having been the ancient Uſage of the Church,
thorow ſeveral Ages, for Miniſters to be appointed,
and for Dignities and Benefices to be conferred by
the Election of the Clergy and People; ſo as never
to have any Rector or Prelate impoſed upon them
againſt their will: the Juſtice whereof is proved by
St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> from Examples in Scripture, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from a Divine Right. Now, notwithſtanding
this way of Electing, by reaſon of the Contentions
and Diſturbances wherewith it was many times at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
has been laid aſide; nevertheleſs, it has never
been ſo far condemned, as not to be capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſtored again in part, or in whole if the Church
ſhould think good. Farthermore, there are ſeveral
actual Rights, that ariſe purely from that ancient
One; namely, all Patronages belonging to Princes
in Cathedral Churches; which, if there ſhould be
occaſion, I will undertake to prove, that they do
not hold them by that Title the Popes pretend they
do: For which reaſon, the Legate does not care
that they ſhould be ſo much as mentioned, but is
labouring all he can to have a Doctrine condemned
in ſuch a ſenſe, that muſt, in effect, deſtroy them.
And as in doing this they will condemn an ancient
Cuſtom of the Univerſal Church, ſo they will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57465:109"/>
ſhut a door againſt all future Remedies, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all to the Pope, to the introducing of more
Abuſes; and that after ſuch a manner, that how
neceſſary ſoever it may be to oppoſe them, there will
be no doing of it; and ſo the World ſhall be left
without any hopes of ever ſeeing things redreſſed.</p>
               <p>The Diſputes about this Affair have been loud
and warm, by reaſon of the Legate's endeavouring
to carry this and every thing elſe he has a mind to
by Threats and Terrors.</p>
               <p>The Legate pretends likewiſe to add a Clauſe,
which would finally determine the Queſtion of the
Pope being ſuperiour to a Council; in which he
has been contradicted by ſome of the Diſputants,
who alledged that there was no occaſion for med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with ſuch matters at this time, and that it
could not be done without giving great ſcandal, and
raiſing a mighty broil: And the Biſhop of <hi>Oran</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
only to ſay, that he was doubtfull in the
Point, and for that reaſon deſired ſome farther time
to conſider of it; he was taken up by the Legate
after a moſt inſolent and injurious manner: who
told him thereupon, That whoever was doubtfull
in the Faith, was a Heretick; and that he was a
Heretick for having ſaid what he did: All which
the Biſhop ſuffered with a great deal of patience.
By this your Lordſhip may ſee how things are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
here, and in what things they place Faith.</p>
               <p>Beſides what I have obſerved, there is another
Clauſe behind, which will be extreamly prejudicial;
it is that wherein the Legate pretends that no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
or Prelate has any Right, in any Caſe, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from God, but that they derive all their
Rights purely from the Pope's Grants and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
and that all Offices, Benefices not excepted,
are ſolely at the Pope's diſpoſal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:57465:110"/>
Now is it not a pleaſant thing to have people, at
a time when they ſhould be redreſſing and removing
ancient Abuſes, labouring to eſtabliſh ſuch things as
theſe, and to beſtow all upon the Pope? As it is
plain they are from the paſſage <hi>Cujus diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,
&amp;c.</hi> in the Clauſe I ſend you with this.</p>
               <p>Now what may truly and reaſonably be allowed
the Pope, is, That he is Prince and Vicar of the
Catholick Church, or the firſt Biſhop to whom all
others are ſubject and ſubordinate; but not ſo, but
that other Prieſts and Biſhops do derive their Right
from God, and not from the Pope, who, without a
juſt Cauſe, has no Power either to deprive them, or
to diminiſh any of their Rights; every Biſhop in his
Cure having as much Power from Chriſt as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the diſcharge of his Office, though with
the fore-mentioned Subordination and Subjection,
this is the Doctrine of St. <hi>Auſtin, Cyprian, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,
Gregory, Bernard;</hi> in a word, it is agreeable to
the conſent and interpretations of the Church;
neither was the contrary ever aſſerted by any but
Paraſites, who were the People that have ſtarted all
ſuch matters of Benefices and Juriſdictions.</p>
               <p>For as Paternity is an Oeconomy belonging to a
perſon, which cannot be taken away without a juſt
Cauſe, though the ſubject thereof is in ſubjection
to a Prince; ſo a Prelate, who is a Father and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
is not deprived of his proper Rights by being
ſubject to the Pope: So that to go about to eſtabliſh
an Hierarchy in the Church upon any other bottom
than this, is, in effect, to confound and deſtroy it,
and to ſubject it to more inconveniencies than can
be imagined: Nevertheleſs the Pope, if he could
carry this Point, though all things elſe were ruined,
and whatever was done in the ancient Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
would find his own Account in it; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57465:110"/>
that, there would be no poſſibility of ever having
any thing redreſſed.</p>
               <p>I was the firſt that diſcovered this Plot, which I
communicated to <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> and others, as was
proper; by which means, it is now underſtood by
every body to be both an impertinent and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Clauſe, which ought neither to be propoſed,
nor ſo much as mentioned any more: Nay, ſome
of the Deputies have been ſo eager to have it quite
laid aſide, as to declare, that they will not meddle
with any buſineſs till that is done.</p>
               <p>The Legate is at work with his tricks, asking
all people why they are for depriving the Pope of
his Power; behaving himſelf at ſuch a rate, that
ſome of the principal Deputies are for going no
more to the Congregations; that is, of the Deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſince they enjoy no liberty, and are affronted
when they are there; and the Biſhop of <hi>Cologne,</hi>
who is one of them, has ſaid, That in caſe the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
ſhould carry thoſe Points, he will deſtroy the
Papacy thereby; and he certainly ſpoke true, in that
it would run a very great risk. Now if theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
ſhould be brought into the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and not be remedied, we ſhall have buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
enough to employ our Thoughts about. I was
willing to give your Lordſhip an account of this,
as in duty bound; as alſo to let you ſee how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
the Suſpenſion of the determination of thoſe
Doctrines is, as well for the ſake of the Proteſtants,
as that we may have more time for to take breath,
for the preventing of ſuch Inconveniencies, and to
keep ſuch great Diſorders and Violences from being
eſtabliſhed; to the hindring whereof, the Congreſs
of the Proteſtants will be of no ſmall effect; who,
when they come, may perhaps agree to do what the
Legate does not think of.</p>

Our Lord remedy things, for there is great need
of it, and protect and proſper your moſt Illuſtrious

               <p>I Arrived here ſafe and well, praiſed be God for
it, by Dinner-time, on <hi>Sunday</hi> laſt, being the
21ſt Inſtant; but ſo loaded with the Favours and
Obligations, not to mention the former, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
was pleaſed to lay upon me, that it will not be
poſſible for me, ſhould I live a thouſand years, ever
to diſcharge ſo great a debt.</p>
               <p>May God preſerve your Lordſhip as we, and I
in particular, ſtand in need he ſhould, and give me
ability to endeavour to ſatisfie that debt in part;
who, whatever I am, or ſhall be, ſhall always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
your Favours, and employ my ſelf wholly
in your Service: But ſince that can never amount to
the payment of ſo great a debt, I do kiſs your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
hands a thouſand times, and particularly for
your writing to every body concerning me as you
do; whereby you do me ſo many Favours and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
that I can ſay no more of them, than I have
ſaid already.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as I arrived here, I gave an account of
my Negotiation to the Embaſſadors, who, as your
Lordſhip will underſtand by their Letters, were well
ſatisfy'd with the Diſpatch I brought; and I did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
<hi>Don Franciſco</hi> particularly with the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he is under to your Lordſhip, for the ſpecial
care you take of his Concerns, and the eſteem you
have for his Perſon; of all which he is extreamly
ſenſible, and is undoubtedly much your Lordſhip's
Servant, and withall as honeſt and well-deſerving a
Perſon as you take him to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:57465:113"/>
I have likewiſe told all the Prelates and learned
Men that are here, how much they are beholden to
your Lordſhip, for the particular care you take to
lay all their Merits and Services before his Majeſty;
for which, being ſenſible how much they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to you, they do kiſs your Lordſhip's hands;
recommending you, together with his Majeſty, to
God in their Sacrifices and Prayers: I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
acquainted them with the particular good Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
you do them, which has given them great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
By which means, and that of his Majeſty's
religious Conduct, the Prelates ſeem to be much
animated to ſerve God and his Majeſty, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
whatſoever ſhall be judged convenient: being
much troubled to ſee the delays and artifices that
are uſed by the Legate, and at his giving them no
part in any buſineſs whatſoever: but that being no
new thing, they bear it the better.</p>
               <p>Being in haſte, I could not ſtay to dine with the
Cardinal of <hi>Trent;</hi> who, being ſollicitous to know
of me, what was done concerning his own and ſome
other Affairs, I told him how it had been ordered,
acquainting him with ſome other things as I thought
convenient, and particularly with your Lordſhips
and the other Miniſters being his Friends, as I was
his Servant: Which though he readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
yet the account I gave him of the Treaty,
put him into ſuch a Paſſion, as obliged me to ſay all
I could to ſoften him again; aſſuring him, upon his
ſaying that he would in a ſhort time go to Court
himſelf; that when he did, your Lordſhip would
ſatisfie him in all Points, and let him know how
much I am his Servant: With this he ſeemed to reſt
ſatisfy'd; ſo, I ſuppoſe, he will not be wanting to us
in our preſent great Dearth, and eſpecially at this
time, when the Pope's Miniſters are ſo untoward,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57465:113"/>
as your Lordſhip ſees, and as I have writ they are.</p>
               <p>When I parted from Court, the Biſhop of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudia</hi>
accompany'd me a Mile or two out of Town,
giving me an account of the Troubles he is in, and
of his Intention for to have come to this place; he
is a Perſon I never ſaw before, but he appears to me
to be a very honeſt Man; but it is enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
him to your Lordſhip that he is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.
I gave him the beſt directions in his buſineſs
I was able, adviſing him to make all the haſte he
could to <hi>Trent;</hi> and having thus recommended him,
I muſt beſeech your Lordſhip for to diſpatch him;
for beſides, that he may do us ſome ſervice here, it
will be a deed of Charity to relieve an oppreſſed
Prelate.</p>
               <p>The Legate is full of Fears and Jealouſies, leſt I
may have made ſuch a relation of affairs to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
and your Lordſhip, as is not for his purpoſe;
who having deſired to ſpeak with me, gave me to
underſtand, how much he was his Majeſty's Servant,
and that he did not know how the things, we ſpoke
of, had been taken by the Pope; it would require
much time to recount all that paſſed in this Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
only he ſpoke as one that was extreamly jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
both of the Pope and his Majeſty, and that was
willing to give me ſome general ſatisfactions: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
him the beſt I could, without doing any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
to the truth in general terms; with which
he appeared to be ſatisfy'd; which I did to ſoften
and diſpoſe him the better to do buſineſs, and to make
him ſenſible how much he is beholden to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
and your Lordſhip; whoſe moſt Illuſtrious and
Reverend Perſon and State may God preſerve and
proſper for many years, as I deſire.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>WHen I arrived here, the Legate's heart was
ſo ſet upon the Suſpenſion, as if his Life had
been engaged in it; he and his creatures talking of
nothing elſe, and giving it out, as a thing that his
Majeſty deſired, to the great grief of ſeveral of our
Prelates: but things are now changed from what
they were, and the Legate, by his behaviour, does
ſufficiently manifeſt what he has in his thoughts;
the Embaſſadors and I having met about the preſent
affairs, they ordered what ſhould be ſaid to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
appointing <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> according to cuſtom
to ſpeak to him, which he did, a full account
whereof your Lordſhip will meet with in their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>The main of it was to undeceive the Legate as
to the Suſpenſion, and to acquaint him with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
his Majeſty would have given to the Proteſtants
when they come, and with the manner how he
would have them proceed here at preſent, in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
concerning Matrimony, without reſolving and
decreeing the Matters that are ſuſpended, both for
fear of hindring the Proteſtants from coming, and
becauſe it was ſo ordered at the laſt Seſſion.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip will eaſily imagine how the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
reſented this, who going continually armed
with artifices, and the end he aims at, would come
to no concluſion, pretending the time is too ſhort
to diſpute about Matrimony, and that without
breaking Order, the reſolving and decreeing of what
has been already handled, and was ſuſpended, could
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57465:114"/>
be put off no longer; telling us at laſt, that he was
content to wait a few days to ſee whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
would come or no; which, it is ſaid, he
granted, that he might have time to acquaint the
Pope with that whole affair; without whoſe Order
he dares not do any thing: But as to his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there was no poſſibility of bringing him to
change it; nay, we had much ado to keep him from
concluding the ſuſpended Matters immediately,
though we repreſented to him of how ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it would be as to the Proteſtants coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and who, whatever happened, would take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
from thence to excuſe themſelves, if the firſt
thing that was done after their Arrival, was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his Majeſty's Order: And as to the Clauſes
he has ſet his heart ſo much on, we ſhall be ſure to
have trouble enough with him about them.</p>
               <p>And whereas the thing the Legate aims at, is to
make this Affair ſubſervient to his Pretenſions, or to
ſome diſturbance or other; he told <hi>Don Franciſco</hi>
and me, that theſe being Matters that were agreed
on in <hi>December,</hi> he muſt hold a Seſſion, and go on
with them; but in caſe the Proteſtants ſhould come,
that he would then ſuſpend every thing; ſo that it
was to no purpoſe to begin to diſpute about Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
ſince they had not time to conclude any thing
about it: To which I returned him ſuch an anſwer
as I thought proper, doing it with all the addreſs
and dexterity that I am maſter of: With which,
though he ſeemed to be convinced, he afterwards
reſolved to go on with what he had purpoſed:
Upon which I ply'd him very cloſe, repreſenting
to him the neceſſity there was of proſecuting the
Council, and in order thereunto to begin to diſpute
about Matrimony, notwithſtanding they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
nothing therein; not but that ſome Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57465:115"/>
relating to it might be propoſed and reſolved,
leaving the reſt to another Seſſion. This I would
have had done, that there might be nothing that
looked like a Suſpenſion, to the defeating of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
who knows very well what he drives at; he
ſaid, if the Synod muſt do ſomething, he would
have them enter immediately upon the Anſwer that
is to be returned to the Proteſtants: I told him, I
was not of his mind; for that ſince the Proteſtants
had not demanded an Anſwer, there was no need
of making ſo much haſte with it; telling him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
That if what was done did not appear to be
what his Majeſty had ordered, it would ſerve only
to provoke the Proteſtants; and as to the courſe he
was ſo much for, if that were taken, his Majeſty
would certainly be blamed for it.</p>
               <p>This is the preſent poſture of Affairs; not but
that the Legate, notwithſtanding he has his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
what he is to do, is full of Fears and Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions,
imagining that we deſign to promote ſome
things, that are no ways agreeable to his Pretenſions;
and who being armed to carry the ſaid Clauſes, and
againſt a Reformation, is, ſo far as I can judge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to have all things ſuſpended, in order to the
having of but one Seſſion more; reckoning, that by
having all things decreed together, he ſhall ſtave off
a Reformation, and promote a total Suſpenſion,
which is the thing he chiefly aims at: For the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why he will not proceed at preſent, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
by every body, is his being ſenſible that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
is againſt a Suſpenſion, and would have the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
proſecuted, and what is reaſonable done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
and whereas ſhould the Proteſtants come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the determination of all things would then be
ſuſpended for ſome time; ſo that the next Seſſion
would be celebrated without doing any thing: This,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57465:115"/>
though it would do well enough for the Proteſtants,
would not agree with what the Legate drives
at.</p>
               <p>My Opinion in this caſe is, That ſince the Legate
cannot be brought to do what we would have him,
that it would be the leaſt inconvenient to ſuffer ſome
days to paſs over, and not to begin as the Legate
would have us; and if it could be done, it would
be convenient that ſome time before the Seſſion,
they ſhould begin to diſpute about Matrimony,
though they ſhould determine nothing therein;
and in caſe the Proteſtants do come, that a Seſſion
be held by all means, which that it might have
ſomething to do, nay employ it ſelf about Canons
of Reformation; to the obtaining of which, it will
be neceſſary to ply the Pope cloſe; for if that is not
done, the Legate will jog on in the ſame beaten road
he went in the laſt Seſſion; which will be a very ſad
thing, and eſpecially conſidering the report that is
ſpread abroad here by the Legate and other Papal
Miniſters, of the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, whom they have
entirely in their hands, being reſolved to depart.
Were we but certain that the Proteſtants would

               <p>I have here met with a Report of the Pope's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to tranſlate the Council to <hi>Mantua;</hi> and
though I do not believe there is any ground for the
Report, I am apprehenſive, leſt the Pope finding
himſelf preſſed hard by both Proteſtants and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
may ſtrike up a Peace with the <hi>French;</hi>
and I am very much miſtaken if he and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are not at this time plotting ſome bold thing,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57465:116"/>
which nothing but Fear will keep them from exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting:
For which reaſon, it is convenient your
Lordſhip ſhould conſult with his Majeſty about an
Order, that ſo we may be provided for any thing
that may happen. May God direct all, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
and proſper your moſt Illuſtrious Perſon and

               <p>IT is but three days ſince I writ at large to your
Lordſhip; what has ſince happened, is, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Number of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops having aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
together in a Convent; ſent four Deputies to
<hi>Don Franciſco</hi> and the Legate; I happened to be
with <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> when they came to him; their
buſineſs was to acquaint him with their being much
diſſatisfy'd, at their not being acquainted with any
thing that was done, the Legate having never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with them whether it was convenient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed;
adding, that both they and the Council were
affronted, by having ſo little account made of them,
and by being allowed ſo little liberty, with ſeveral
other things to the ſame purpoſe; telling us far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they intended to go to the Legate, and
expoſtulate the matter with him. To all which, <hi>Don
Franciſco</hi> returned them a very diſcreet Anſwer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
them with the things his Majeſty had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
and with the Legate's unreaſonableneſs in not
granting them, nor ſuffering the matters relating to
Matrimony to be diſputed; which, though they had
come to no Reſolutions about them, ought to have
been done for the ſatisfaction of the World; and
that the Conduct of the Legate and Preſidents was
ſuch, that nothing could be offered in its Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
diſſuading them nevertheleſs from going near
the Legate, who being fix'd by a Reſolution he had
received from the Pope by a Currier, their waiting
upon him would be to no purpoſe, unleſs it were to
raiſe a ſtorm, or to furniſh him with an advantage
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57465:117"/>
for the carrying on of his Pretenſions: He aſſured
them farther that the Legate ſhould quickly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with their buſineſs; and that it ſhould not
be long before they ſhould ſpeak to him about this,
and ſeveral other matters: concluding, that ſince we
had all the ſame aims, we ought all to act jointly.
So with much ado, for they appeared very reſolute
and obſtinate, he prevailed with them not to go
near the Legate, in which I aſſiſted him all that
I was able. Now though I do not doubt of the
Prelate's having gone into this with a good zeal; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
in this juncture, I muſt needs ſay, it was
not according to knowledge. I heard ſomething of
this buſineſs before it broke out, being informed
that one of the chief Prelates, and who was the
perſon that firſt moved it, and brought all the reſt
into the Combination, had been perſuaded, or to
ſpeak more properly, gulled into it, by one of the
Preſidents; it was he of <hi>Verona,</hi> who put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
complaining to <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> and the Legate,
of things being delayed as they were; which was
done for no other end, but to furniſh the Legate,
who was the chief contriver of it, with an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
to pretend, that now the Prelates began to
complain and mutiny, it was full time to have the
ſuſpended Doctrines reſolved and determined; and
that ſeeing there was not time ſufficient for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing
of all the Doctrines relating to Matrimony,
they muſt go on with that of Order, which is the
diſorder he has ſet his heart ſo much on.</p>
               <p>The Legate is hard at work to perſuade the
World, that his Majeſty, though he pretends to be
againſt a Suſpenſion, but would have the Council
proceed and hold a Seſſion, does, by delaying things,
promote it all he can, hoping by means of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
for to compaſs his Ends. God knows how
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57465:117"/>
true this is, as he does alſo, what aims and deſigns
the Pope and his Miniſters have in their heads, who
muſt not, at this time a day, think to play ſuch a
game, as they are playing, without being diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>We hear the Pope has ſent the Legate a ſevere
Reprimand, for having admitted the Proteſtants,
and for having ſuffered things to run into ſuch a
confuſion; ſo that it is plain, their chief buſineſs at
this time, is to ſhut the gate again, and either to
ſtave off the Congreſs, or to put an end to it as ſoon
as it is poſſible, by getting the Clauſes in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Order decreed and keeping the Prelates
from conſenting to handle the Doctrines of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
untill the end of the Seſſion. On which Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
the Legate's Soul is ſet ſo much, that he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand
Negotiating hard for Votes; ſo that we
have ſtill cauſe to fear, that he may carry his Points
at laſt: He has been informed, that my late buſineſs
with his Majeſty was to conſult with him about
thoſe Clauſes; he had this Information from a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Prelate, whom he named when I was gone; I
am certain I never ſpoke of it to any body, and do
ſtill endeavour to conceal it, ſo far as is convenient:
This Intelligence diſturbs the Legate extreamly, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him very penſive.</p>
               <p>I am informed likewiſe, that the Pope very much
complains of me, in ſome Letters from <hi>Rome,</hi> for
having been ſo active in procuring an Audience for
the Proteſtants, but chiefly for what I did in the
ſafe Conduct, in getting the Clauſe <hi>Pro ſanctiſſimo
patre noſtro,</hi> which was put in by the Legate, for to
be ſtruck out, and for having on that occaſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
that he was ſuperiour to a Council; having
ſaid then, that there was no reaſon for the Synod's
ſuffering of ſuch words, or for its acknowledging
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57465:118"/>
any ſuch ſuperiority: But having been told ſince,
that I had no other intent in that whole matter, but
only to prevent the Proteſtants taking offence, and
ſome other inconveniencies, and that I did not
touch on thoſe Controverſies, I hear he is pretty
much quieted again; but let that be as it will, for
it is no great matter if he is angry; it is certain the
Legate, to excuſe himſelf, has made ſtrange relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of things in his own favour: What he writ to
<hi>Janus</hi> concerning <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> being falſe to my
knowledge. <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> in my mind, proceeds
with great moderation, being carefull how he ſaith
or doth any thing that may give diſtaſte. We muſt
wait to ſee what will be the iſſue of this, which we
ſhall now know quickly: And, in the mean while,
we muſt beg it of your Lordſhip, that we may be
acquainted with all Emergencies, and may have his
Majeſty's poſitive Orders for what he would have
done: And that we may know in time whether the
Proteſtants do intend to come hither, all that is
to be done here, depending much on that, that ſo
we may have our Inſtructions ready. Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
has had my Opinion already of all theſe affairs:

               </opener>
               <p>ON the 26th and 28th I writ to your Lordſhip,
giving an account of what had paſſed: What
at preſent offers, is, That we are hourly involved in
new difficulties, the Legate not being himſelf untill
he has carried his Point; who has not got only the
<hi>Italians,</hi> who are of his own Sect, but ſeveral of our
Prelates likewiſe on his ſide; who have been perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by him, that his Majeſty, for ſome end that he
tells them, is for delaying the Council ſo much,
that if he could have his will, it would never end:
And notwithſtanding the major part of them, and
all of them that are Men of underſtanding, do know
the truth of this matter, and do ſee plainly what
the Legate would be at, and that all he ſaith and
doth is trick and artifice, things are nevertheleſs
reduced to the foreſaid terms: And whereas the
Legate's Soul is ready to leap out of his Body, to
have the Clauſes of the Doctrine of Order paſſed
and determined; he promotes every thing that tends
to that end, on purpoſe to ſhut the door againſt the
Proteſtants; being much troubled at his having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
an Audience to <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Envoys and thoſe of
<hi>Wittemburg;</hi> for which, as I am informed, he has
had a ſevere Reprimand from the Pope: For which
reaſon, and that there may be no Seſſion held, after
the ſuſpended Matters are once determined, or elſe
that he may have ſome colour for raiſing a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
he will not ſuffer the Doctrine of Matrimony
to be handled, deſigning thereby to bring the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
under a neceſſity of determining the ſuſpended
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57465:119"/>
Doctrines, or to bring about ſome other End he
has in his eye: For he pretends, that if a Seſſion is
not held for the determining of thoſe Matters, that
the <hi>Italians</hi> will be gone, neither will it be in his
power to keep them much longer at <hi>Trent:</hi> Though
there is no body but knows, that whenever they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
it will be, becauſe he has ordered them to go,
in order to diſſolve the Council: All which, though
they may perhaps be only brutal pretences given out
according to his cuſtom, for the carrying and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing
of his deſigns; nevertheleſs, conſidering on
what terms things are here at preſent, and how the
Pope and his Miniſters, ſince the Congreſs with
the Proteſtants, are changed from what they were,
and the Apprehenſions they are under of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
inſiſting on having a Reformation, and the
great Agony they are in till the foreſaid Clauſes are
determined; it may juſtly be feared, that they will
by one way or other bring about the Diſſolution of
the Synod: Which will certainly be done, if they
can but get the ſaid Clauſes determined, becauſe in
them they will have gained all that they deſired;
and after that, will never ſtand in need of any more
Councils for to ſerve their Pretenſions: And in caſe
they ſhould not be able to carry thoſe Points, they
will then, to rid themſelves of this Yoke, that is
upon their Neck, and of the Fears they will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
when they ſhall find that they are not able to
bring the Synod to do all the miſchief to the Church
and to the authority of the preſent and all future
General Councils, that the Pope and his Miniſters
would have them, they will then perplex and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
all: which is a moſt deplorable thing.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, the Legate, either becauſe
he has received Orders from the Pope, by the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
that came yeſterday to him from <hi>Rome,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57465:119"/>
he himſelf thinks it fitting, and knows cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
that the Pope will approve of it, is reſolved
on <hi>Monday</hi> next come ſevenight, to aſſemble the
Council, to treat of and reſolve the Matters that
are ſuſpended, and finally to determine them, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
declared that he has waited long enough for
the Proteſtants; who, ſince they are not come all
this while it is not to be expected that they will
come at all; and for that reaſon it is convenient
to hold a Seſſion for the determining of the ſaid
Matters: Upon which notice, the Embaſſadors have
propoſed two ways, who, as your Lordſhip will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
by their Letters, are doubtfull which of
them they had beſt take; The one is, not to oppoſe
the Legate any more, ſince though thoſe Matters
ſhould be reſolved, if there ſhould be a neceſſity of
it; or in caſe the Proteſtants ſhould come, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of them may be prorogued to a farther
time: The other is, to ſpeak freely to the Legate,
and to let him know that they are ready to agree
with him in what he would have done; on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he will deferr the Seſſion for ſome time,
that ſo all that remains may be determined at once:
That way of theſe two your Lordſhip ſhall approve
of, or any other you ſhall pitch upon, ſhall be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
by me to be the moſt convenient. But as
things ſtand, ſince we are not able to do more, the
firſt of thoſe ways appears to me to be the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient;
which is, to let thoſe things paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
oppoſing them; and my reaſon is, that we ſhall
thereby prevent our running a risk of what the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
has always ready for us; <hi>viz.</hi> the Prorogation
of the Synod, which he has power to make, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſhall judge it to be moſt convenient; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
now there are ſuch Diſputes and Tragedies
raiſed among the Prelates, who, as I have obſerved,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57465:120"/>
are much divided in their Opinions, meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though for different Ends, in Junto's; the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of Tumults being an art the Legate and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
have to perfection; witneſs what they did, to
hinder his Majeſty's Orders from being obſerved,
and to keep the Synod from diſputing of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
though it had not proceeded to any determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about it; which was done by them on purpoſe,
to diſpoſe things ſo, as to lead the Synod neceſſarily
to the doing of the buſineſs they drive at: All which
makes the firſt way appear to me to be the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient.
A Prorogation, however it is brought
about, will, in my opinion, be attended with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inconveniencies: the chief whereof will be, its
opening a gate to the total Suſpenſion of the Synod,
which is the thing the Pope and his Miniſters have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
drove at: All which is offered by me, with a <hi>ſalvo</hi>
to the Proteſtants coming hither before the Seſſion
is held, or to our being certain that they will come
in a ſhort time; in which caſe, out of reſpect to
them, the Seſſion ought to be deferred. Finally,
let what will happen in this way, his Majeſty will
be juſtify'd, and the Papalins will have no colour to
ſuſpect him any longer of thoſe things they have ſaid
of him continually: But the great difficulty we
ſhall have to ſtruggle withall, if this courſe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
will be how to prevent the paſſing of the Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of Doctrine; it being to be feared, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
has ſo managed his affairs, as to have the major
Vote on his ſide: The arrival of the Proteſtants,
though it might create new difficulties, would help
us out of the ſtreights we are in at preſent; and
were we but certain that they would not come, and
had thereupon Orders to hold a Seſſion for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the foreſaid particulars, we ſhould be able
to clear matters thereby, in giving the Pope, his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57465:120"/>
Miniſters and others, to underſtand plainly how ill
they have gueſſed at his Majeſty's intentions, which
are open to God and the World; and that it has
been their deſigns, and the fears ariſing from them,
that have been the unhappy inſtruments of invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us in ſo many difficulties about the Clauſes.</p>
               <p>I have always, let what would happen, deſired
that a Seſſion might be held, for the determining
of the Points of Matrimony, as his Majeſty had very
well ordered; even though the Proteſtants did not
come, as a great many are now very confident that
they will not: But whereas what the Legate has
now done, was a thing I never thought of; ſo it
troubles me extreamly, becauſe we cannot hold a
Seſſion now as I deſired, without complying with
his deſigns, unleſs ſome other buſineſs could be
found in part to ſupply the place of that which
ought to have been the buſineſs of that Seſſion, or
the Legate could be perſuaded to ſuffer the Canons
of Reformation to be pronounced therein; to which,
conſidering how he has ordered matters, I believe
it will be impoſſible to bring him. All which
notwithſtanding, if we ſhould be able to do no more,
it will be convenient to hold a Seſſion; and ſhould
the Proteſtants but come, that would anſwer all.
Your Lordſhip muſt judge what is moſt expedient
to be done, and adviſe the Embaſſadors thereof in
time, to prevent our being reduced to ſuch ſtreights,
as we ſhall not know how to get out of.</p>
               <p>What I mentioned above of ſome Prelates meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Junto's, is what I acquainted your Lordſhip
withall in my Letter of the 28th; ſince which time
they have aſſembled again in the Monaſtery of Saint
<hi>Lawrence,</hi> and have ſpoke their minds at large;
which Meetings have furniſhed matter for a great
deal of talk, and have filled the Legate and others
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57465:121"/>
with jealouſies: Whoſe intentions, though they may
be good, and which notwithſtanding they endeavour
to conceal, I know are the ſame I communicated to
your Lordſhip; that is, to Petition for a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſome other things of the ſame nature;
nevertheleſs, their aſſembling ſo in this juncture of
affairs, without acquainting <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> with their
deſigns; notwithſtanding, they pretend to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
without informing him thereof, is a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion,
and a very ill thing. I have declared my
thoughts of it to ſeveral people, and did adviſe <hi>Don
Franciſco</hi> to find ſome ſmooth way to remedy it; I
ſay a ſmooth way, becauſe they are a great number,
and a multitude is a dangerous thing: It muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be done with mildneſs for fear of exaſperating
them, which would but provoke them to take more
liberty; and I do not doubt but he will do it with
his cuſtomary prudence; when any thing elſe ſhall
offer, I ſhall not fail to adviſe your Lordſhip there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
I have added this, that your Lordſhip, by join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to the reſt, may ſee that there is matter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for the Diligences your Lordſhip knows of:
Whoſe moſt Illuſtrious and Reverend Perſon and

Legates do aſſiſt, may, whatever is done therein, by
reaſon of its Effects, be ſaid to be General or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal;
nevertheleſs, when we ſpeak of General
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57465:122"/>
Councils by way of Excellency, we underſtand thoſe
Aſſemblies which are reckoned to have been ſuch,
for their having been famous, and of great authority,
and celebrated in a place of Freedom by the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and Concourſe of all Nations. So from that
of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was celebrated in the Time of Pope
<hi>Sylveſter,</hi> to that, that was in the Time of <hi>Adrian</hi>
the Second; there were eight Councils, which were,
for the foreſaid Reaſons, reckoned to be General,
they having been all Aſſembled by the Emperors,
and had all the Pope's Legates preſent in them, the
Pope in perſon having never aſſiſted at any of them:
And ſo notwithſtanding the Popes did both during
that <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ime, and ſince, aſſemble divers Councils at
<hi>Rome;</hi> however they might ſtyle them General;
they have never been reckoned ſo, but in compariſon
of the others, have ſtill been held only as dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
or particular Councils.</p>
               <p>After the Eighth Synod, that of <hi>Conſtance</hi> is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
to have been the Ninth, which was very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and of great benefit to the Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
               <p>The next was that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> wherein there were
hot Diſſentions betwixt <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Fourth, and
the Fathers aſſembled therein. <hi>Eugenius</hi> celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Council at <hi>Florence</hi> at the ſame time: This
does ſomewhat diſturb the reckoning; for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two Councils at the ſame time, and an Altar
againſt an Altar, one of them muſt neceſſarily have
been illegitimate. So that they who hold that of
<hi>Baſil</hi> to have been valid, I mean after <hi>Eugenius</hi> had
broke with it, there being no queſtion of its validity
before that rupture, do reckon it to have been the
Tenth Council, as they who condemn that of <hi>Baſil,</hi>
as a Conventicle that brought forth a <hi>Baſilisk,</hi> do
reckon that of <hi>Florence</hi> to have been.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:57465:122"/>
All which notwithſtanding, in the laſt Edition
of the Councils, he that made the Collection,
doth either raſhly, or becauſe he would do it, call
that of <hi>Florence</hi> the Eighth General Council, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
either never ſeen, or forgot the Eighth Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
that was in the Time of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second,
not daring to put that of <hi>Conſtance</hi> in that Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
becauſe it eſtabliſhed the Authority of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
above the Pope: For which reaſon <hi>Leo</hi> the
Tenth aſſembled a Synod at the <hi>Lateran,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to it, and to that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which though he
was pleaſed at every Turn to ſtyle Univerſal, has
never been admitted into that Number; and as it
was only an Oeconomical, and not an Oecumeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Council, ſo we feel to this Day of what Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
it was to the Church; beſides Truths
which have been once eſtabliſhed by Councils,
namely that of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> can never be ſhaken after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
it not being poſſible that what was once a
Truth, and dictated by the Holy Spirit, ſhould
ever be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Now according to this reckoning our Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> muſt be the Eleventh Synod, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neither the Pope, nor his Legates are willing
to have it reckoned ſo, who at the opening there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were in a great perplexity, how to rank it.</p>
               <p>This is the Account of the Univerſal Synod;
for albeit there were Councils celebrated by the
Apoſtles, and from which all ſucceeding Councils
do derive all their Authority: This reckoning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences
nevertheleſs from that of <hi>Nice,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
of 318 Fathers; becauſe Chriſtians from the
Time of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> have had the Liberty to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
together, after that of <hi>Nice,</hi> from which
the Canons of General Councils do commence;
the Councils of <hi>Conſtantinople, Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:57465:123"/>
were celebrated, which four having been venerated
by St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> as the four Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels,
does not leſſen the Authority of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Councils that were lawfully aſſembled.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, the way of proceeding in
paſt Univerſal Councils comes now to be obſerved,
and that in order to diſcover, how different it was
from the procedure of this preſent Council, and
how great Inconveniencies do follow thereupon;
the way of convocating, proſecuting, and finiſhing,
being quite contrary in thoſe, and this Council.</p>
               <p>All the Eight General Councils having been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the Emperours, the Fathers injoying an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Liberty in the proſecution of them, and the
whole Authority being lodged in the Body of the
Council, and if the Pope's Legates did at any time
delay their coming, the Council, if there was an
urgent Neceſſity, did its Work without them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from the Definition of the Eighth Council,
made before the Arrival of the Legates, which runs
thus. Having long expected the Arrival of the
Vicars of the Elder <hi>Rome,</hi> and it not being juſt to
wait any longer for them, it appearing to us an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
thing to neglect the loſt Church of Chriſt,
by ſuch delays, we do of Neceſſity denounce, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The ſame is to be met with in the Geſts of the
Second <hi>Epheſine</hi> Council, which after having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertized
<hi>Julius</hi> a Biſhop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Hilarius</hi> a Deacon, and
<hi>Dulcitius</hi> a Notary, the Vicars of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> that
the Council was to aſſemble next Day, deſiring
them therefore to make haſte to come to them;
upon their not appearing when they were expected,
<hi>Talaſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> ſaid, Beſides that our
remaining in this City is a great prejudice to the
moſt Religious and Holy Biſhops, and their
Churches, the moſt Pious and Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57465:123"/>
would have us to haſten the End of this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
that ſo he may be acquainted with what ſhall
be decreed therein; Wherefore the Synod having
done what was proper and convenient for it, in
having invited the Vicars of the moſt Holy Friend
of God Archbiſhop <hi>Leo,</hi> I am of opinion, that
ſince they have refuſed to aſſemble with us, that
we ought not to uſe any farther Delays. This is to
the purpoſe, as to what is doing here at this time.
Finally, whatſoever was offered, and commanded
to be obſerved by Univerſal Councils, being for
that reaſon of inviolable Authority, it did not want
the Confirmation of the Pope to give any thing of
Validity to it; neither was it for that, but for
other honeſt and juſt Ends, that they firſt began to
make uſe of that Confirmation; there being no
reaſon, why what is determined by a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
by the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, ſhould
have its Truth in ſuſpence, ſo as to depend on the
Will of any Perſon: for what is once true, muſt
be always ſo. This is manifeſt to all but Paraſites,
or ſuch as ſeek by Tricks, utterly to deſtroy the
Authority of General Councils, of which a great
deal might be ſaid, had I not ſomething elſe in my
Eye at preſent; I ſhall therefore only obſerve that
the Argument drawn by thoſe People, on which
they lay ſo much ſtreſs from Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
contradicting the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as to
what it had ordained relating to the Chairs of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is not of ſo great Weight
as they imagine, and repreſent it to be in their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,
ſeeing that Council, notwithſtanding that
Contradiction, did ſtill adhere to its Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and which after having been obſerved for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Years, was at laſt confirmed by the Sixth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council: but to return to the Direction of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:57465:124"/>
There was, as has been already obſerved, an entire
Liberty in them, their whole Authority being lodged
in the Body of their Aſſembly: as is plain from
the Councils themſelves, the Pope's Legates ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no other than an honorary Preſidence in them,
and the privilege of voting firſt; the Preſidents
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t interloquerentur &amp; definirent,</hi> being named by
the Emperour, and ſtyled <hi>Judices diſcretivi,</hi> as is
plainly to be ſeen in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and
in the Eighth Council alſo, in which, in the firſt
Action they ſpoke as follows: Our Emperours have
ſent us their Servants, and who are called his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,
to be diſcreet Hearers of all that ſhall be
tranſacted. After which the Fathers celebrated the
Council, and ſpoke and determined matters with
an entire Liberty: So that as we have no reaſon to
doubt of their having been aſſiſted by the Holy
Ghoſt in all their Determinations, we have as little
reaſon to doubt of the Council it ſelf, having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and governed every thing: for beſides that
the thing is reaſonable in it ſelf, it is no more than
what is of Divine Right, and was expreſly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by the Council of <hi>Conſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is manifeſt likewiſe from the Council of the
Apoſtles, in which St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as we ſee, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he was the Prince and Univerſal Paſtor of
the Church, did not preſide with Authority, or a
co-ercive Power; on the contrary it is plain, that
the whole Power was in the Aſſembly; and as in
the fifteenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the Determination was
pronounced by <hi>James;</hi> ſo it is ſaid there, that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
riſing up in the midſt of the Brethren, ſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which Action of ſtanding up, is an Argument of
his not having pretended to an Authoritative Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency,
for if he had he would have ſate, and not
have riſe to ſpeak, as is well obſerved by <hi>Abulenſis,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:57465:124"/>
though <hi>Turrecremata,</hi> and others of his Stamp, do
interpret this as they think fit; the ſame appears
likewiſe from the Council mentioned in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where it is ſaid, when <hi>Samaria</hi>
had received the Word of God, they ſent <hi>Peter</hi>
and <hi>John,</hi> &amp;c. To which, and a great deal more,
<hi>Turrecremata, Cajetan,</hi> and others of their Party
give a general Anſwer, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> did that pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of Humility, which how much it is to the
purpoſe, let any one judge: It is however undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that by this way of proceeding, thoſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies
we do now labour under were prevented,
every thing being done with great Authority and
Liberty.</p>
               <p>Upon the great Declenſion of the Empire, after
the Eighth Synod, the <hi>Judices diſcretivi</hi> who were
ſent to Councils by the Emperours, ceaſed; who
being Laicks, had never any Vote in them after
that, the naming of Perſons to perform the Office
of thoſe Judges, whom they called Preſidents, and
that without any prejudice, to the honorary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency
of the Pope's Legates, remained in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Council, where according to <hi>Andreas,</hi>
and <hi>Baldus</hi> it was always of right; whoſe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if there were nothing elſe, is ſufficient to prove
it; but beſides, that it was practiſed by the Council
of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which was the Ninth Synod, in its
Ninth Seſſion; as it was alſo in the Seventeenth
Seſſion of the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Pope's Legates on ſuch conditions, as
kept their Preſidency from being coercive, than
which nothing is more remarkable and modern,
and which ought to have been obſerved in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and all future Councils; The very being of a
General Council after it is lawfully aſſembled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
in the Liberty, wherewith all matters of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57465:125"/>
faith and manners are handled therein, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
them openly in peace, and not in corners,
by unlawfull methods; for it is when matters are
thus handled, and defined, that Councils are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
by the Holy Ghoſt in their Determinations:
thoſe Words, It ſeemeth good to the Holy Ghoſt,
and to us, being applicable only to General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
however the Pope may arrogate them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in Perſon, or in conjunction with his Colledge
of Cardinals; for as <hi>Abulenſis</hi> in his Preſace to St.
<hi>Matthew,</hi> well obſerves, nothing is more certainly
neceſſary than an entire Liberty in Councils; for
the want of which, the Second <hi>Epheſine</hi> Council,
though lawfully aſſembled, was not reckoned a
Council, and was accordingly revoked by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo when the numerous Council of <hi>Photius</hi>
was objected to <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt, he made anſwer,
we do not follow the Councils of <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
and the Synodical Conſtitutions of the Holy
Fathers, and other Councils, on account of the
great Numbers of Biſhops that were preſent at
them, but we do reverence their free, juſt, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inſpired Determinations: So <hi>Agatho</hi> likewiſe
writing to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> concerning the Fathers that
were to aſſemble in the Sixth General Council, tells
him, that there ought to be a Promiſe of impunity,
and a licence granted to all to declare their minds
freely, that ſo their faith might be publiſhed to the
World, and that none ought to be diſcouraged or
hindred, from ſpeaking their thoughts, either by
threats or any other methods: a great deal more
might be added to the ſame purpoſe, namely, what
was writ by St. <hi>Leo</hi> to <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour,
concerning the Second <hi>Epheſine</hi> Council, if what
has been ſaid were not ſufficient; from all which, as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57465:125"/>
the Authority and Majeſty of General Councils is
manifeſt, ſo it would ſtill be more conſpicuous, if
we ſhould go to the bottom of the Power that was
lodged in Synods, ſo as to lay open how great it
was, and of what ſort of People they conſiſted, and
what Authority they exerciſed over all, and what
was every ones part in hearing and obeying: but I
know not by what fate of the Commonwealth, if I
may ſo ſpeak; thoſe Aſſemblies are no fallen from
that heighth of Authority, every thing in them
being ſo altered and disjointed, that no Footſteps of
their Ancient Majeſty are to be diſcovered in them:
ſo that for the puniſhment of our ſins, they ſeem to
be juſt upon expiring that having happened to
them, which ſeems to be the natural Condition of
moſt humane Bleſſings, in having had their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
their Youth, and Old-age which is always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
by death; I ſay this, becauſe in the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of this Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> there does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
the leaſt footſtep of any of the forementioned
Eſſentials of a General Council; on the contrary,
the moſt pernicious and effectual Methods that can
be contrived, have been taken to deſtroy Liberty
totally, and to rob Councils of that Authority,
which in caſe of great ſtorms, uſed to be the ſheet-Anchor
of the Church, by which means they have
cut off all hopes of ever having any Abuſes that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
the Church redreſſed, to the great diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all paſt, as well as future Councils, from
which no good is ever to be expected. For as St.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Tract of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> and <hi>Stoicks,</hi>
ſpeaking of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching at <hi>Athens,</hi> ſaith
that the whole Multitude is threefold, and conſiſt
of Believers, Mockers, and Doubters, ſo it is not
poſſible for us to expreſs, and much leſs to exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
of how pernicious conſequence the conduct
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57465:126"/>
of this Council has been; in which under the Title
of directing it, the Pope's Legates have ſo mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
matters, that nothing but what they have a
mind to can be propoſed, diſcuſſed, or defined
therein, and that too after ſuch a manner as they
would have it, or as it comes ordered from <hi>Rome,</hi>
whither they are ſending every hour for Directions,
ſo that at the ſame time they talk of liberty, they
are deſtroying it by their Actions, all the liberty
that is here being only imaginary, ſo that their
naming of it, is nothing but cheat and banter;
which is ſo notorious, that ſeveral of the Prelates,
even among the Pope's Penſioners, have not the
face to deny it, but do with other holy Men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
things being brought to ſuch a paſs; and
though the iniquity of the Times, and the preſent
Poſture of Affairs may keep them from declaring
ſo much, it cannot keep them from ſighing to ſee
things go as they do.</p>
               <p>I come now to prove the Truth of what I have
ſaid in general, from particular inſtances in this
Council, it being neceſſary to the curing of the
Malady, for to underſtand it.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, the Pope's Legates have made
uſe not only of an honorary Preſidency, which
ought not to be denied them, but of an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
and coercive one; following in every ſtep
the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> that was celebrated by
Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenth, which they would gladly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonize,
naming it at every Turn, as if it had been
a General Council, and ſuch a one too as deſerved
to be a pattern to all others; whereas in truth it
was only a Domeſtick Synod: however it being for
the advantage of their pretenſions to have this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
managed after the ſame manner as that was,
its conduct hitherto has been the ſame, to the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57465:126"/>
great prejudice of the Authority of the preſent, and
all future Councils, as appears from ſeveral inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
namely from the Legates not ſuffering the
Clauſe of <hi>Eccleſiam Univerſalem repraeſentans,</hi> to be
inſerted into the Decrees; adding inſtead thereof,
and inculcating that of <hi>Praeſidentibus eiſdem tribus
Apoſtolicae ſedis Legatis,</hi> which is a new thing, and
has a Myſtery in it: but above all, from the clauſe
they have inſerted into the Canons of Reformation,
which is, <hi>Salva ſemper in omnibus ſedis Apoſtolicae au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate;</hi>
which is telling the World in plain
terms, that what the Pope does not like, ſhall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
nothing: for notwithſtanding, the Power of
diſpenſing when there is juſt cauſe, is always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
yet the Legates knowing it would be more
for their advantage to have it expreſſed, they had
it done: but this being notorious to every Body,
and having formerly had occaſion to ſpeak of it, I
ſhall proſecute it no farther.</p>
               <p>2. Whereas the Deſign of the Legates was ſo to
manage all matters, that nothing but what they
had a mind to, and was in their ſecret Commiſſion,
ſhould be able to paſs, they erected three Claſſes,
one for each Legate, in which ſuch of the Prelates
as were moſt in their favour were to report mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
now theſe three Claſſes meeting in ſundry
places, at the ſame time, to treat of the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the Legates did manage that to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
with an Artifice beyond what is to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
their Deſign therein being to pump the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
ſo before hand, as to find how they intended
to vote; and having diſcovered that, the three Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,
did according to their Cuſtom cabal together
at Night, and having conferred Notes, took their
meaſures accordingly, in either going on, or in
ſending advice to <hi>Rome,</hi> or in negotiating with Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57465:127"/>
by certain methods that they have, to change
their minds; and this they have done ſo often,
that it is now taken notice of by every body; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can there be any courſe more pernicious or
more deſtructive of the liberty of the Council,
and what makes it the worſe is, that it is done for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth
under a pretence of Religion, and that things
may be the better examined: <hi>Quia falli, labi, deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi,
humanum eſt, ſed ſub ſpecie Religionis turpiſſimum
atque execrabile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farthermore, The Legates, by the help of the
diſcoveries they make in their ſeveral Claſſes do learn
what things they may propoſe in the General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
and when it is beſt to do it; and ſo
when they judge it to be moſt for their purpoſe, they
have Matters diſputed in a particular Congregation
by the Divines, to have them ready when they ſhall
think fit to propoſe them in a General Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which they do commonly ſuſpend upon ſome
pretence or other till they have conſulted <hi>Rome;</hi>
which being done, the Legates do very artificially
conduct Matters, as they have ordered them; that
is, ſuch Matters as they have a mind to have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined:
For as to thoſe that are not approved of,
they are by ſome means or other ſtifled, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the whole Council is for their being paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, There are ſeveral Inconveniencies
in their way of Voting; for the Legates, when they
judge it to be for their advantage, that every one
ſhould declare his Opinion at large, do permit them
to do it; but when it is moſt for their purpoſe, that
they ſhould only ſay <hi>placet</hi> or <hi>non placet</hi> to any thing
they have propoſed, they then oblige them to Vote
ſo. In the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Courts, as <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi>
tells us in the 7th Chapter of his 14th Book, there
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57465:127"/>
were two ways of making Laws, either <hi>per diſceſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
or <hi>per ſententias ſingulorum exquiſitas;</hi> of which
the laſt was moſt in uſe, and is certainly the beſt
way. The way of Voting in former Councils, was,
That every one was permitted to ſpeak his mind
freely; and notwithſtanding they who have writ
thereof, do obſerve, that the Synods did many times
anſwer to what was propoſed to them with <hi>placet</hi>
or <hi>non placet;</hi> it is nevertheleſs to be conſidered,
that when nothing is to be done in a Seſſion, but
only to pronounce the Decrees, which are already
agreed on; in that caſe there is no inconvenience
in anſwering with <hi>placet,</hi> which prevents the Action
being ſpun out to an unneceſſary length, though, at
the ſame time, the Prelates were left to their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Vote otherwiſe if they pleaſed, and to approve
or contradict as they thought good; which is all
we know of the way of Voting uſed in the ancient
Councils, our Writers being ſilent as to that which
is of greateſt moment, which are the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that were antecedent to the Seſſions; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Matters were examined and concluded, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
indeed the whole ſtreſs of the buſineſs lay; all
that was done in the Seſſions being only to publiſh
what was before agreed on: In which Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if every Prelate was not permitted to Vote ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and to ſpeak his Mind freely, it was an impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon them; and the Fathers, who were there
as Judges, muſt have appeared only as Parties, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compelled to anſwer to what was propoſed with
<hi>credit</hi> or <hi>non credit:</hi> As to which Point, there have
been here ſo great prejudices, and ſo little liberty,
that it would be a long buſineſs to ſet down the
whole thereof.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, The Legates formerly contented
themſelves with an honorary Preſidency in Voting
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57465:128"/>
firſt, and delivering their Opinions of things, as the
other Fathers did; whereas having now uſurped an
authoritative and coercive Preſidency, they ought
not to Vote in any caſe, nor to deliver their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to propoſe only, and ſuffer every one to Vote
freely; to act otherwiſe being an impoſition, and a
pre-judging of the Cauſe, and a means of Terror;
in which, as in every thing elſe, great Exceſſes have
been committed: the Legates, having many times,
when they have propoſed a thing, declared their
Opinion of it, giving their <hi>non placet</hi> to things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fathers could give their <hi>placet;</hi> nay, in the
middle of Voting, when they have obſerved any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
not to Vote as they would have him, they have
taken upon themſelves to ſpeak to it before another
was ſuffered to Vote, doing it ſometimes with ſoft
Words, and at other-times with harſh, letting others
to underſtand thereby how they would have them
Vote; many times railing at the Prelates, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
them to ſcorn; and uſing ſuch methods as
would make one's heart bleed to hear of, and much
more to ſee: So there was one, who in the face of
a General Congregation, called all the Prelates <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peculas,</hi>
who were for having the Clauſe, <hi>Univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
eccleſiam repraeſentans</hi> added; which could not
be obtained, to the great detriment of the Council,
and the great reproach of thoſe who were called ſo;
all which, notwithſtanding the Legates go on ſtill
with their <hi>dicant Patres libere;</hi> which, conſidering
how they carry things, I wonder with what face or
conſcience they can pronounce thoſe words.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, Paſſions and hard Words are not
wanting here, and that among ſome of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals;
from which, no leſs than from their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Legates derive advantage, the honour of
the Apoſtolical See, and the Pope's pleaſure and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57465:128"/>
diſpleaſure being daily ſet before the Prelates to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midate
them.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, In the ordering of the Decrees
which they were to pronounce in the Seſſions; and
which, conſidering of how great moment they were,
ought to have been diſcuſſed, with a cloſe attention,
the Legates took a courſe, that was extreamly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and prejudicial. For whereas, after having
diſpoſed Matters according to their importance, the
Decrees ought to have been compoſed ſome days
before the Prelates did aſſemble, and to have been
ſeen and examined particularly by every one of
them, that ſo they might have underſtood what
they were about, and whether there were any thing
amiſs in them that was ſo far from being obſerved,
that the Legates having aſſembled the Prelates in a
General Congregation, the night before the Seſſion,
read the Decrees to them, as they and their friends
had been pleaſed to frame them. By which means,
and by their not being underſtood by a great many
of the Prelates, and others not having the courage
to ſpeak their Minds, and others being quite tired
out with the length of the Congregation, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
were paſſed; and having concluded many things
after this precipitate manner, they pronounced them
next day; which, whether they were prejudicial or
not, let them ſee to it: We, for our parts, who ſaw
and obſerved all thoſe doings, cannot but lament,
both our own condition and the loſt authority of
Councils.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, Notwithſtanding we are to believe,
that in Matters of Faith, which have been decided
by them, the Holy Ghoſt would not permit them
to fall into any Error; we are nevertheleſs, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
before, to conſider with what authority and
diſcuſſion, ſuch Matters ought to be determined, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57465:129"/>
how few of thoſe that were here, were qualify'd for
that work; for among thoſe who had a deciſive
Voice, I do not believe there were Twenty; and for
the other learned Men and Divines that diſputed,
they had only the Hearing given them. It was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Decrees being thus prepared and decided,
that the Embaſſadour <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza,</hi> when
the Legates were in ſuch haſte to pronounce the
Decree of Juſtification, ſent a Prelate to acquaint
them with three Things: The firſt whereof related
to his Majeſty; the ſecond to himſelf; and the third
to the Bearer. The firſt was, That before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
a matter of ſo great importance, for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
the Univerſities of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Lovain</hi> about it.
The ſecond was, That if they went on at this rate,
his Majeſty would ſend ſuch a number of Biſhops to
the Synod, as would not ſuffer them to carry things
ſo. The third was, That there neither was, nor had
been, any thing of liberty in the Council. To the
firſt they anſwered, That they would die a thouſand
Deaths ſooner than yield to a thing, that would be
ſo great a diſhonour to the Council: the Biſhop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
That he did not ſee that there could be any
inconvenience in the Legate's conſulting thoſe Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities;
and he might, if he would have ſaid far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor in the Council it ſelf having done it, and
that the World would never have condemned them
for it. For ſince, as I have obſerved, great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
and Diſcuſſion is neceſſary in all ſuch Caſes;
and Univerſities are Bodies that cannot go to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
as particular Men may; it was but juſt, that
thoſe two Univerſities being ſo famous, ſhould have
been conſulted; the taking of whoſe advice, would
not have hindred the Synod from determining what
the Holy Ghoſt ſhould have dictated to them: In
fine, the Legate, without taking any farther notice
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57465:129"/>
of that meſſage, cauſed the ſaid Decree to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
as it is: And as to the other two Points,
any body may gueſs what ſort of Anſwer he returned
to them.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, In the Seſſion wherein the Decree
of Original Sin was pronounced; the Legate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having conſulted or ſaid a word to the Synod
thereof, did all of a ſudden read the Pope's <hi>breve</hi> in
confirmation of that Decree; a thing they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince offered to do. By which we may ſee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what account they make of the Council; giving
the World by that Act to underſtand, That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
are therefore valid, becauſe they were confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Pope; without whoſe Confirmation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
their being agreed to by the Council,
they would have been of little authority: This,
though a thing of great conſequence, paſſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Prelates offering to open his mouth againſt
it.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, It was much inſiſted on, that the
Reformation of Abuſes ſhould go before Matters of
Doctrine; all the Miſchiefs having ſprung from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes,
they being the things that ſupport the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
and keep them in countenance; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereupon agreed, that they ſhould go hand in
hand; the Legates, that they might ſeem to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
therewith, begun with the Abuſes of Scripture;
and being brought at laſt to treat of Abuſes in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
they decided ſo little therein, and that too
with ſo many limitations, that it had been much
better they had done nothing in it: It being viſible to
the whole World, that all that was done, was done
at <hi>Rome;</hi> which was rejoiced at and boaſted of here,
and that on purpoſe that the World might be made
ſenſible, how little the authority of the Council ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd,
as to the redreſſing of things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:57465:130"/>
Farthermore, As the Legates were continually
fencing off a Reformation made by any other way
than that, ſo being deſirous to pump out of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
what the things were they pretended to; at the
beginning, as if they had deſigned to make a mighty
Reformation, and as if the day of Salvation had
been come, they intreated all the Prelates, but chiefly
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to deliver them in Memorials for their
inſtruction of ſuch things as they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:
the Prelates believing that all would be
remedy'd, did very innocently acquaint them with
all that was in their thoughts; by which trick, the
Legates having diſcovered all that the Prelates and
Provinces deſired, they ſent an account thereof im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to <hi>Rome,</hi> as was underſtood afterwards:
This the Prelates did, notwithſtanding they were
warned by one before-hand, of what would be the
conſequence of it.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, As the Legates do nothing but
with tricks and diſſimulation, ſo in the Seſſion that
was held here after ſuch an irregular and tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a manner, they made uſe of an artifice which is
now notorious to every body; for having the Pope's
<hi>breve</hi> always privately in their Pockets to make uſe
of as there is occaſion, upon ſome Prelates having
on the day of the laſt Seſſion, in their oppoſition,
unadviſedly ſaid, that the Pope knew nothing of that
matter; for that if he had ordered it to be ſo, it
would have been another thing; the Legates there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
immediately produced the Pope's <hi>breve,</hi> and
by ordering it to be read publickly, did ſtop the
mouths of thoſe Prelates, and gave a colour to what
was done; making a Jeſt afterwards of their having
taken the Prelates at their word: Such over-reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as theſe have been their principal ſtudy in moſt
matters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:57465:130"/>
Farthermore, As it was the Legates drift, ſo far
as they were able to canonize the Abuſes of the Court
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo to weaken the Authority of the
Council, that the Prelates ſhould not have the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to treat freely about Reformation, they never
gave them leave to treat thereof any other way, than
as has been mentioned; it being their whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to make a Party, as if what they were about
were a huckſtering matter, or were the compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Law-ſuit, in all which courſes it is certain
the Holy Ghoſt did not aſſiſt, ſtriving ſtill to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
Abuſes, and giving the World to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that the Pope is gracious in granting them
any thing, as if all were his own, taking Abuſes,
though never ſo pernicious, and ſplitting them as
they thought good; by which Artifice, that part
of the Abuſe which was approved of by the Synod
becomes perpetual, and for the part that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated,
they will according to their cuſtom find
ways to defeat its condemnation. To which end
the Legates have given the Fathers to underſtand,
that they have a Golden Bull which ſhall approve
of all that ſhall be done: Now let any one judge
whether this be a true way of celebrating a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
or of making a Reformation: for upon this
foot it was debated here, that the Reformation
might be made at <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is in effect, and not
by the Council, nothing having been done here,
but what was ordained at <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that if every
thing, that is any ways prejudicial to the Council
is not done here, the World has reaſon to thank
them for it.</p>
               <p>But beſides all this, and the Synods not having
the managery of it ſelf, there is nothing can be ſo
much as to put the Vote without the conſent of the
Legates; who notwithſtanding, by reaſon of the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57465:131"/>
great Number of Penſioners which the Pope has
here, are always ſure of a Majority, do neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
make uſe of ſtrange Tricks in their conduct of
the Council: Beſides, by having made their own
Creatures, the Secretaries, Notaries, and all the
other Officers of the Council, they have made it
thereby a body, <hi>Tot habens aedituos uti ſacrae aedis cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodes,</hi>
and without any thing of Soul or ſtrength in
it; Whereas all thoſe Officers ought to have been
appointed by the Council, and eſpecially the Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
for otherwiſe what ſecurity can the Council
have, that they will write down any thing, that
they do not know to be agreeable to the Pope and
the Legates; or at leaſt that they will not ſtifle the
Truth, or expreſs it ſo as ſhall amount to the ſame:
So if they who made the Proteſtation at <hi>Bononia</hi>
had not had Notaries, and Witneſſes of their own,
they would have ſuffered ſufficiently on that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This is the courſe that has been hitherto taken
in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which is employed rather
in ſtrugling with the Pope and his Legates, who
ſeek to ingroſs all to themſelves, than in reforming
and remedying the Evils, under which the Church
groans. I pray God it do not increaſe them by the
courſe it takes, which is by Artifice and Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſo far to reduce the whole Synod to the
Will of the Pope, that it ſhall be the ſame thing
for the Pope alone to deliberate of things at <hi>Rome</hi>
with his Creatures; as for the Fathers here aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to do it, which is the truth of the matter,
the Council being really at <hi>Rome,</hi> and at <hi>Trent</hi>
nothing but the Execution of it: The ſubſtance of
all that is done here, being ſent hither determined
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and being what the Pope with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals
deputed there, to that purpoſe, and who do
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57465:131"/>
meet together continually, have determined before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.
So that it may be truly ſaid, that we are
here in a Convention of Biſhops, but not in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
I wiſh theſe be not the laſt days: Whether
things will continue to be carried on thus, to the
End of the Council I know not; but I do very
much ſuſpect they will, and that for this reaſon;
becauſe they cannot be put into a better way for the
Pope's purpoſes, and his Legate's who is coming,
who ſuppoſing he were willing to remedy things ſo
far as it is poſſible to do it by the way they are in;
yet conſidering the times, and the preſent poſture of
things, it is by no means convenient, to run the
risk of it; for which reaſon divers are of opinion,
that ſince no remedy can be expected, it would
have been much better not to have celebrated a
Council at this time, but to have waited until God
had put the Chriſtian Commonwealth in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
diſpoſition, than it is in at preſent, or till this
period, which cannot laſt long, had been over,
than to have celebrated one after this manner with
ſo little fruit, to the great ſorrow of Catholicks,
the ſcorn of Hereticks, and the prejudice of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
and all future Councils, and what makes me
immoveable, in ſuch thoughts of the conduct of
this Council is, the very Legation that is ſent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by his Holineſs being ſo contrived, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could have been invented more proper for
compaſſing of his deſigns, in having ſent but one
Legate, with two preſidents: For which, though
they give another colour, neither have I ſeen their
Powers; it is manifeſt, that their deſign therein, is
to reduce all to a Monarchical Order and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and to have all Affairs managed by one ſole
confident, to prevent the differences that might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe
betwixt three Legates; whereas ſince their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57465:132"/>
here is to preſide; had it not been for that
reaſon, they would all three have been called ſo: It
is true, that the word Legate, ſignifies an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of the Pope, or of any other Prince; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
according to the Style of the Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and of modern Lawyers, none but Cardinals
are ſtyled Legates <hi>à latere;</hi> others though em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the ſame buſineſs, being called by other
Titles, as <hi>Nuncio,</hi> or as theſe are here Preſidents,
from their buſineſs, which is, to preſide; which
Title they take care frequently to inculcate; that
they may be thought to obſerve the ancient Cuſtom
of the Apoſtolical See, of ſending three Legates to
Councils; notwithſtanding two of them have not
the ſame Authority with the third: After the ſame
manner the Senate ſent Ten Embaſſadours to <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
when he was fighting with the barbarous Nations
to be Councellours to him, with whoſe aſſiſtance
and advice he did great things: <hi>Pompey</hi> in the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratical
War had likewiſe twenty Five Legates ſent
to him; the Ancients uſing ſo to join ſome with
thoſe they ſent to govern Provinces, that it was
doubtfull whether they were their partners, or only
their companions.</p>

               <p>IN caſe things ſhould be carried in the Council,
as they have been hitherto, as we have reaſon to
believe they will, it will then be neceſſary to find ſome
remedy for it; and by later cares, if not to revoke,
at leaſt to repair things ſo far as may be: which
though it is a duty incumbent on all, it is His
Majeſty's concern, after a ſpecial manner, who as
he is Emperour is Advocate of the Church, and
Protectour of the Council, and the Executour of its
Laws, and is bound to ſee that the Council injoy
an intire Liberty and Security; neither can time
or cuſtom prejudice that Authority which a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
derives immediately from Chriſt: nay, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
it ſelf cannot part with it, or with any branch
thereof to the Pope; no more than the Pope, or
the Emperour, ſo long as they hold their ſeveral
Dignities, can make one to be their equal or ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:
For according to the Philoſopher, an inferiour,
ſo long as the differing Terms do ſubſiſt, cannot
partake of that which is above it, which is an Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om
approved of by the common Vote of all Writers:
Wherefore ſince the Embaſſadour above all others,
is to take care of this, he ought to have ample
Powers given him by His Majeſty, that ſo with
them and his own Endowments, he may be able
to tranſact, ſpeak, perſwade, diſpute, countenance
and direct, with that prudence and dexterity, as
ſhall be needfull on all occaſions.</p>
               <p>For though certain Rules may be given in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
caſes, a great many muſt be left to prudence, in
which after the manner of Gladiatours Council is
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57465:133"/>
to be taken upon the Spot: For where inſtructions
cannot be given for all Emergencies, many things
muſt be left to the Fidelity of the Perſons that are
employed according to <hi>Seneca,</hi> in his Epiſtle to
<hi>Lucillus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A great deal might be ſaid in General of the
Office of an Embaſſadour, and of his main buſineſs,
and of the care he is to take of Religion, and
Reformation; but that being what every prudent
Man may underſtand; I ſhall deſcend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p>The principal thing I have to ſay, is, that the
Embaſſadour muſt be ſure to remember what the
paſt conduct of this Council has been; that ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſenſible of former Irregularities, and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
he may know how to find out a remedy
for them, and to govern himſelf according to the
old ſaying, <hi>Piſcator ictus ſapit,</hi> every head of ſuch
things being as an inſtruction to him.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, beſides the care the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
is to take, to maintain the liberty of the
Council, and to encourage ſuch as ſpeak with a
good zeal, he muſt take heed to what is propoſed
in the Congregations, obſerving who it is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth,
and what he may propoſe to himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
or to what end he propoſeth it: and what will
be the conſequence of doing it, or of leaving it
undone; the ſubſtance of all his buſineſs conſiſting
in theſe four things: The diſcuſſion of all which,
as it requires a great application, ſo the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
muſt be ſure never to be abſent, from the
Congregations, and Seſſions, that ſo things may not
be carried as they were, when there was no Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
here for ſome time, and who was out of
the way, when his preſence was moſt wanted, which
was when the Legates withdrew themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:57465:133"/>
Farthermore, the Embaſſadour muſt engage the
Prelates that are ſent here by His Majeſty, not to
deliver their opinions preſently in any caſe, that is
propoſed to them, and not to ſpeak to things till
after they have concerted them among themſelves:
for by having commonly voted raſhly, and before
they did well underſtand the matter, and what may
be the conſequence of it, they have given the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
an advantage, to carry whatever they had a
mind to.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, the Embaſſadour muſt after the
Prelates have conſidered the matters, that have
been propoſed, aſſemble them together to conſult,
that ſo they may go united as one body to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations;
without which they may labour their
hearts out, without doing God or His Majeſty any
ſervice; it being impoſſible that they ſhould do bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
well, if that courſe is not taken.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, the manner, time and place, where
the Embaſſadour is to aſſiſt, ought to be all well
conſidered of. The courſe that has hitherto been
taken here having proved abortive; for what can
the Embaſſadour being preſent only at the publick
Seſſions ſignifie, all things being ſo determined and
ſetled before they came there, that they want only
to be publiſhed: for it is in Congregations that the
ſtreſs of the buſineſs lies, in which matters have
been carried as I have intimated, at none of which
the Embaſſadour ever aſſiſted, neither would they
admit him to be preſent at them, or if they ſhould
give way to it, it is not poſſible for him to be at
them all three at once, and much leſs will they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to be preſent at the Congregations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
matters are argued by the Divines: Now mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
being thus conducted in the private Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
the Embaſſadour aſſiſting as he uſes to do, at
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57465:134"/>
the publick ones can ſignifie but very little; matters
when they are brought thither, being in a manner
already determined, ſo that the Embaſſadour knows
nothing of what paſſes, but by relation; and as for
the learned men appointed by His Majeſty to be of
his Council, they can never know any thing any
otherwiſe, having never been ſuffered to be preſent
at any of the General Congregations, at which they
ought to aſſiſt of right; as to which Affair that a
better Order may be ſetled, is plain from the
courſe that has been taken by other Princes
here, and from the courſe that was taken by the
Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> in former Councils, namely thoſe
of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid it is manifeſt, that the
Embaſſadour muſt by no means ſuffer the Legates
to have their ſeveral Claſſes, that being a thing of
moſt pernicious conſequence, and deſtruction of the
liberty of the Council, as I have obſerved before:
For as it is reaſonable that he ſhould aſſiſt at all
Congregations, that ſo nothing may be propoſed
therein without his knowledge and approbation; ſo
that there is the ſame reaſon for his being preſent,
at all the private Congregations which are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Synod, though the Perſons they are to
conſiſt of ſhould be named by the Legates: For if
he is not preſent when things are propoſed therein,
and handled in thoſe Congregations, how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for him thoroughly to underſtand them, or
to perceive what the Legates aim at in them, or
which is the ſame what their Creatures drive at to
whom they many times give Orders to propoſe
things and to ſpeak to them. For till this is done
His Majeſty's Embaſſadour is directly excluded,
and the Legates will carry whatever they have a
mind to, as they have done hitherto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:57465:134"/>
Farthermore, Since whatſoever is determined in
Matters of Doctrine, ought to be done with great
Maturity, and a ſevere Diſcuſſion, and never but
when the urgent Neceſſities of the Common-wealth
do cry to have it done; otherwiſe Diſputes and
Schiſms, that are not eaſily removed, may follow
thereupon, as is acknowledged by all; namely, by
<hi>John Gerſon</hi> in his Tract <hi>de Examinatione doctrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi>
it is therefore the buſineſs of the Embaſſadour
to bring things into another method than they are
in at preſent: For as I have obſerved before, of an
hundred Fathers aſſembled together any-where, it
is well if twenty of them are Divines, and capable
of underſtanding ſuch matters, the greater part of
them, though otherwiſe good Men, being unlearned;
and thoſe that are learned, are ſo in other Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
or if they underſtand any thing of Divinity,
it is but at ſecond-hand. From hence it is, that
ſome, in my judgment, with good reaſon have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
that the Synod after it is aſſembled, ought
to name ſome learned and eminent Divines, and to
allow them, though they are not Biſhops, a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Voice, and that for the ſtricter Examination of
all Matters of Doctrine, that are to be defined; it
is fit likewiſe that they ſhould conſult the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Univerſities, as I have ſaid before, and as the
Embaſſadour would have had them to have done,
before they pronounced the Decree of Juſtification,
and not to have ſo much regard to the Plurality of
Voices, <hi>Quia ſtultorum teſte Philoſopho infinitus eſt
numerus,</hi> as to the weight of the judgment of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Men, to whom this buſineſs ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the Synod. <hi>Hinc illud Plinii junioris di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,
de quodam Senatus conſulto, aut quadam Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
ſententia, loquentis; quod quamvis ſibi non probari
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57465:135"/>
ſignificans, ſed hoc pluribus inquit viſum, numerantur
enim ſententiae non ponderantur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farthermore, Though the Embaſſadour muſt be
carefull not to quarrel with the Prelates, namely
the Legates; but above all, not with the Pope, and
who muſt for that reaſon be carefull to manage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
with dexterity and modeſty; nevertheleſs, he
muſt not always ſit ſilent in the Congregations, but
muſt at once with modeſty and vigour declare what
he judgeth to be moſt convenient; and muſt encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and oppoſe as there is occaſion, <hi>Ut intelligant
omnes illum os habere, ipſeque tanti principis legatus
minime videatur aſymbolus.</hi> There being nothing that
can in reaſon countervail the Exorbitancies he will
ſuffer, being the Emperour's Embaſſadour, and
much leſs the great Bondage the Biſhops are brought
under.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, The Embaſſadour ought, in my
opinion, to take care not to ſuffer <hi>Doctrines quae
ſunt praeter fidem,</hi> to be determined; and the rather,
becauſe there are ſome in great haſte to have it
done, that ſo there may be ſome means of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with the <hi>Lutherans</hi> left: I take this to be
a thing of the greateſt importance, conſidering that
the Hereticks, who are coming now to reduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which may God of his infinite Goodneſs give
them grace to do, will be willing to have ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
given them, for their Obedience and Reduction.
The Articles that are proper for that purpoſe, and
over which, being of a poſitive Nature, the Synod
has power to do what it pleaſeth are manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, Since, as I have obſerved before,
the Council is in effect celebrated at <hi>Rome,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing here, but the execution of what comes
determined from thence, his Majeſty's chief care and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57465:135"/>
vigilance muſt therefore be employ'd at <hi>Rome;</hi> and
that there be ſuch an agreement and correſpondence
ſetled betwixt his Embaſſadours, that they who are
there may adviſe and direct thoſe that are here, and
they that are here may do the ſame to thoſe that
are at <hi>Rome,</hi> adviſing one another particularly of
every thing of moment, or that may be any ways
prejudicial: For let the Legates diſſemble as much
as they pleaſe, it is manifeſt, things will be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
here, as they are ordered by the Pope and his
Deputies.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, For-as-much as I have obſerved
before, it is a thing of dangerous conſequence, that
the Notaries of the Synod ſhould be all the Legate's
creatures, the Embaſſadour muſt endeavour to bring
the Synod to name ſuch to that Office, as it ſhall
judge to be fit for it; and that the Prelates that
are here from his Majeſty, and the other Nations,
do either name their own, or agree to name ſome
in general.</p>
               <p>Finally, Whereas Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> from the beginning,
gave a Brief to the Legates to ſuſpend or tranſlate
the Council, when, or to what place they ſhould
think fit; which Brief they kept ſecret till they had
occaſion to uſe it; it would likewiſe be expedient,
that the Embaſſadour, beſides his ordinary Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſhould have a ſecret Power in form from his
Majeſty, to proteſt againſt any Suſpenſion or Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which the Legates may offer to make; ſince
ſuch a caſe may happen as did before, and matters
may fall out ſo, that it may be a great prejudice to
us not to have ſuch a Power ready. A great many
more things may happen, for which no Rule can be
given before-hand, it being impoſſible they ſhould
all be comprehended in Inſtructions; and muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57465:136"/>
be left to the prudence and diligence of the
Embaſſadour, who can have no ſuch inſtruction; as
the obſerving of paſt miſcarriages: The ſecurity and
guard his Majeſty is to give to the Council, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a thing of great moment to its liberty, and to
prevent exorbitancies: This and every thing elſe that
is neceſſary, may his Majeſty with his holy zeal and
ardent deſires find out; and withall, ſuch a remedy
for the Church, as he hath for a long time been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
to procure; and may he provide ſuch things
as are convenient for the Service of God and the
Reformation of the Chriſtian Common-wealth:
His Majeſty, under God, being the Supporter of all
the hopes and confidence, that the World has, of
ever ſeeing things better than they are.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THE Reaſon why I have been ſo long in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
an Anſwer to your Lordſhip's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the 29th of <hi>September,</hi> was, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Buſineſs we have always juſt before the
Seſſion, when we are employ'd in correcting and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the Decrees, and in informing the Biſhops,
by whom Affairs, but eſpecially the Matters of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which are to be placed before the Canons,
are communicated to us very late; ſo that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the ſubſtance of thoſe Doctrines may be
ſound, which it is well if it is; nevertheleſs, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that they are to correct them upon a bare
hearing them read upon the Eve of the Seſſion, that
muſt, in my opinion, hinder them from having that
Authority and Majeſty, which ſuch Matters do uſe
to have: I pray God give them Grace to mend
this.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon why they do thus precipitate ſuch
things, are theſe two, in my judgment.</p>
               <p>1. The Divines, in the handling and diſcuſſing
of ſuch Matters, no leſs than the Fathers afterwards,
are guilty of great Oſtentation, affecting to ſpeak
much, to the ſpending of a great deal of time. It
being common to have people commended here, for
having ſpoke an hour, an hour and an half, and
ſometimes two hours: which they are now about
remedying for the future.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:57465:137"/>
The Other is the Legate and his Faction indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriouſly
putting off the Examination of Doctrines
to the very laſt day; which they do on purpoſe,
that there may be no time left for the promoting
of any Doctrines relating to a Reformation; unleſs
they be ſuch, as they are willing to have paſſed: And
as nothing can be more palpable than this, ſo we
are not to hope ever to ſee it remedy'd; It being
notorious that the Legate is ſo abſolute in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
that though the Pope himſelf ſhould be brought
to yield to the carrying of things otherwiſe than
they are; that he would oppoſe him in it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he would gratifie both his Maſter and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
therein: Of which, the difficulty he made in
the ſuſpending of the Article <hi>ſub utraque</hi> was a clear
inſtance: having threatned on that occaſion, that he
would be gone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> notwithſtanding he was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at the ſame time, how neceſſary it was to do it,
and had received the Pope's Order for it; who, as
your Lordſhip writes, appears willing to comply with
his Majeſty in ſuch things: In which, if he is real,
it would be convenient, that whatever the Pope is
willing to have done here for the good of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and the remedying of <hi>Germany,</hi> may not be
only ſignify'd to the Legate, but that he be made
to underſtand that his Majeſty and his Embaſſadours
here are acquainted with his Holineſs having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it to be done; that in caſe any ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as the former ſhould be ſtarted, they may be
known to be of the Legate's own creating, who, I
ſuppoſe, will then rather chooſe to yield, than take
the whole Odium of ſuch things upon himſelf, or
this will at leaſt make the redreſſing of ſuch matters
much eaſier than formerly they have been.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:57465:137"/>
What I have to add, is, That though it is not
fit that any thing ſhould be done here without the
Pope's being firſt acquainted therewith, nor indeed
without his conſent; it might nevertheleſs be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
that the doing thereof ſhould be managed with
all poſſible ſecrecy; in order to prevent the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi>
if they ſhould come to know of it, reflecting
upon the liberty of the Council, and the freedom
that the Prelates enjoy, who might ſafely enjoy more
without having any thing paſs to the prejudice of
his Holineſs.</p>
               <p>The Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> is arrived here very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably,
who will be very uſefull to us in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Affairs. I have already had ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with him, and have acquainted him with the
truth of the buſineſs relating to the Suſpenſion of
the Article <hi>ſub utraque:</hi> I have likewiſe, in the Name
of the Embaſſadour, told the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> what
his Majeſty's mind is in relation to that matter, and
how neceſſary it is for the good of <hi>Germany,</hi> and for
the bringing of the Proteſtants hither, beſeeching
him as a Prince of the Empire, who very well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
its Wounds, and deſires its Cure, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
us therein at the Deputation; he promiſed,
but with ſome difficulty, to do ſo, but has never
ſpoke a word of it ſince, having been frighted by
the Legates threatning to be gone, ſince the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
was robbed of its liberty, by having Articles ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
after they had been handled: Adding, That
if Matters were ſuſpended upon his Majeſty's wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to have it done; that that would give ſome
colour to what the <hi>French</hi> had ſaid already of the
Council, and of its being aſſembled for no other
purpoſe but to ſerve the Ends of ſome particular
perſons. By ſuch methods as theſe it is that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
who is a very ſubtil Man, and much vers'd in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57465:138"/>
buſineſs; finding that Elector to be jealous and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolute,
does ſo manage him, as at leaſt to make
him hold his tongue.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding I did plainly perceive how
it was with that Elector, I did not let him know
ſo much; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the contrary, extolled his good
Intentions, and the Anſwers he gave me concerning
the Progreſs of our Affairs, and his Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
encouraging him all I could to promote and
countenance them. Though, after all, conſidering
the Temper of the Man, I do not think it will do
much good upon him, unleſs the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi>
who appears to be much more reſolute and fix'd,
ſhould be able to influence him, I wiſh he may.</p>
               <p>We took care to inform the Electors of <hi>Mentz</hi>
and <hi>Triers</hi> of what his Majeſty had wrote hither,
before the Arrival of <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> concerning <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
and with all I knew, relating to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and
the taking of the Ships at Sea. I did it ſo, that they
declared to me, that they were of opinion that not
only the Empire, but all Chriſtendom were ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned in the Evils, which muſt attend a Breach
with <hi>France</hi> at this time, that they ought to lay all
other buſineſs aſide, and apply themſelves wholly to
the procuring of a Peace with this domeſtick Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
By this I plainly perceived how they ſtood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
which put me upon repreſenting to them
the <hi>French</hi> King's baſeneſs, in having broke his word,
by beginning a War contrary to his promiſe, and
in having called in the <hi>Turk,</hi> and for endeavouring
to hinder the Progreſs of the Council; and that for
no other reaſon, but to prevent the Quiet of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many:</hi>
that being the thing in the World that he
dreads the moſt, being ſenſible that a General Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>German</hi> Princes muſt neceſſarily defeat
all his ill deſigns; no leſs than thoſe of his Couſin
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57465:138"/>
the <hi>Turk:</hi> this is the ſubſtance of what I told them
at that time.</p>
               <p>I do here ſend your Lordſhip all that is printed
of the laſt Seſſion; what was done here yeſterday,
your Lordſhip will be informed of by <hi>Don Franciſco</hi>'s
Letters to his Majeſty; the ſum whereof was, the
Decrees relating to Doctrines and Reformation, the
ſubmiſſion and reception of the Procurators of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi>
the ſafe Conduct, and the Anſwer that was
given to the <hi>French:</hi> The ſafe Conduct I had never
ſeen, before I heard it read yeſterday in the Pulpit;
and neither the Fiſcal nor I, for we were together,
were ſatisfy'd with it. At night I was told by <hi>Don
Franciſco,</hi> that the Legate had promiſed to grant ſuch
a ſafe Conduct, as his Majeſty ſhould judge neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
which, though it may not give content, yet will
make it better.</p>
               <p>The Fiſcal is certainly the perſon your Lordſhip
takes him to be; that is, a very judicious and ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Man, and very ſerviceable in giving ſuch directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as are neceſſary in a Council; and he is withall
much your Lordſhip's Servant.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer that was given yeſterday to the <hi>French,</hi>
ſo far as I could underſtand it, by hearing it once
read, was ſatisfactory; it was at leaſt good Latine,
and withall gentle and paternal; and for this laſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
very fit and proper for a Council.</p>
               <p>I cannot omit putting your Lordſhip in mind, that
when his Majeſty deſires that any thing ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd
here, it will be neceſſary to give us timely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
thereof to prevent the difficulties which may
otherwiſe be raiſed by the Legate, who ought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to be acquainted with his Majeſty, having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
ſome things which have been handled and
treated on for to be altered. This, if it is poſſible
ought to be done effectually.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:57465:139"/>
I have been told by the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> who,
I ſuppoſe, has communicated the ſame to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
that it would be expedient that henceforward,
nothing that is here treated of and decided ſhould be
publiſhed, before the end of the Council: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that ſuch matters would come out with the
more authority for being all publiſhed together, it
would prevent the Decrees having Books printed
againſt them by the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>
and who, if they ſhould come hither, would
not hear their doom at the firſt Seſſion, but might
be entertained with hopes till the laſt: But though
the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> do's approve of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I my
ſelf am of the ſame mind; I am nevertheleſs afraid,
that the Legate will ſtart ſuch difficulties againſt it,
particularly its not having been the courſe that has
been taken from the beginning of the Council, that
it will not be practiſed.</p>
               <p>In the next Seſſion the Sacraments of Penance
and Extream Unction will be handled; they were
propoſed yeſterday, and will conſiſt of at leaſt Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Articles: I do wiſh from my heart that they
would proceed more ſlowly untill the Proteſtants ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive,
that ſo they may not, when they come, find
all things as good as determined: But however that
may happen, they will be heard from the beginning
to the end, which will make ſome amends for what
may have been before determined againſt them: This
makes me wiſh that the Proteſtants would make haſte
to come hither; but let them come when they will,
it will be bad news to the Legate and his Party, who,
for that reaſon, are willing to believe, that they will
never come, for they are all in a terrible fright to
think of the freedom they may take to ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Manners and Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:57465:139"/>
I do not find there is any care taken about my
Maintenance, notwithſtanding I am at more charge
than any of my Companions, being continually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Duty. I leave it to your Lordſhip to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it is not fit I ſhould have ſome proviſion made
for me; for what a diſgrace would it be, if it ſhould
come to be known that I have been ſo long neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Wherefore if <hi>Eraſtus</hi> has done nothing in it, I
muſt beg your Lordſhip's aſſiſtance therein.</p>
               <p>The breaking out of the War has, I ſuppoſe, put
a ſtop to <hi>Malgeſa</hi>'s Journey to <hi>France;</hi> for as I have
writ to him, he can have no buſineſs there now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

               <p>NOtwithſtanding I am ſtill very much indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the Air of theſe Mountains, and the
fatigue of Books, I could not forbear bidding your
Lordſhip welcome into our Neighbourhood; where,
though I ſhall not be able to converſe with you but
by Letters, nevertheleſs the thoughts of having
you ſo near is a great comfort to me in this ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but your Lordſhip has had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all that paſſed here, and of the Divines ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpoke, and how well one of our Doctors might
have excuſed treating the good Dean ſo courſely as
he did, in favour of the Articles propoſed by the
Legate; which Doctor, notwithſtanding I, as in
reaſon bound, gave place to the Dean, pretended to
ſpeak before him; but that matter is now remedy'd,
if no other Orders come about it. In the Morning
the Biſhops begun to aſſemble to give their Votes;
they will firſt treat whether it is fit to chuſe Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
preſently, for to form the Canons, upon which
the Biſhops are afterwards to deliver their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
or whether the Biſhops are firſt to deliver their
Minds upon the Articles, and the Canons are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be framed according to their ſentiments;
and being made, are to be returned, to be read and
finiſhed by the Fathers: The firſt is the ſhorteſt
way; but the ſecond having a greater appearance
of liberty and authority in it, will, I believe, be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;

you write to him, to thank him for it.</p>
               <p>I kiſs your Lordſhip's hands a thouſand times for
the favour you have ſhewed to Dr. <hi>Velaſco,</hi> as he
writes me; for which, though it is your Lordſhip's

two hours in the Cardinal's Houſe, but did
not exchange a word with any of his old friends.
<hi>Don Franciſco</hi> complains very much of it; but when
he returns, I ſhall reprimand him for us all. May
our Lord preſerve your Lordſhip's moſt Illuſtrious
and Reverend Perſon, and increaſe your State, as I

               <p>I Had my Pen in my hand to have writ your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the reaſon why I had not anſwered the four
laſt Letters I have received from you, when a fifth
from your Lordſhip, with a Copy of Engliſh Verſes
in praiſe of Father <hi>Bucer</hi> coming to my hand, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
me from doing it at that time. What I was
then about to write, was, That I had been troubled
fourteen days with a Catarrh, not of the pituitous
ſort, which is incident to Students, and does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
purge by the Mouth and Noſtrils, but of that
ſort, which running down from the Head thorow
the Spondals to the Neck and Shoulders, afterwards
ſpreads it ſelf over the Sides, which has brought
me ſo low, that your Lordſhip would ſcarce know
me: Its Pains were moſt violent in the Night, and
were increaſed by Sleep, and chiefly in the Side I
lay on, though ſome Nights ago it was moſt violent
in the oppoſite Side.</p>
               <p>Hitherto it rather increaſeth than abateth ſeizing
me now ſometimes by Day. I believe Exerciſe would
ſpend the Humour, and do me good; which, for
want of Time and Walks, I cannot have here: I do
find a Fit of it coming upon me at this inſtant. I
writ ſome days ago to <hi>Gregory Lopez,</hi> there being
no Phyſician of any note in this place: but I have
not as yet had any Anſwer from him. I hope your
Lordſhip will pardon me for not having as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
an Anſwer to the Bankers of <hi>Beſanzon,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that till my Diſtemper does abate, I am not
able to apply my ſelf to any buſineſs. As there will
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57465:141"/>
not want thoſe that will write of this Council; ſo,
for my own part, I pray God it may not do more
harm than good, and eſpecially to the <hi>Germans</hi> that
are here; who ſeeing how little liberty it enjoys, and
how much it is under the dominion of the Legate,
cannot poſſibly have that reſpect and eſteem for it,
as is convenient: For I can perceive that they are
much ſcandalized, as the Prelates are alſo, to ſee ſo
many learned Men brought by his Majeſty from <hi>Spain</hi>
and <hi>Lovain</hi> only to deliver their Opinions in one
hour, which may be done as well by one of a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Learning, as by a <hi>Fiſher,</hi> an <hi>Echius</hi> or a <hi>Pighius;</hi>
thoſe learned Men having never been called to the
making of the Canons, no, nor Doctrines, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
its having been propoſed to the Legate by
ſome Biſhops, and particularly by him of <hi>Verona,</hi> that
they ſhould be called to it.</p>
               <p>It is certainly a great load upon ſome people's
Conſciences, to conſent to the having the weightieſt
affairs of Chriſtianity handled after ſuch a manner;
and that after his Majeſty has brought Great Men
from Countries where they did much good, no uſe
at all ſhould be made of them; the truth whereof
your Lordſhip will eaſily perceive, by the little or
no Majeſty, that is in the ſtyle of the Doctrines;
and which is ſo different from that of Juſtification,
though even in that there is ſomething left out that
might have been ſaid. This is very much reſented
by <hi>Gropperus,</hi> the Provincial and others: but I am
told by ſome that there is no remedy for it, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reſolved to have all they did at <hi>Bononia</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
here. But as my Diſtemper, which has now
held me thirteen days, has hindred me from ſeeking
to remedy this, ſo my continuing ſtill ill was what
made me acquaint your Lordſhip with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:57465:142"/>
The ſenior Fiſcal diſcovers himſelf to be much
your Lordſhip's Servant by the kindneſs he ſhews
me; he is a Perſon that thoroughly underſtands all
that is to be done here, and is abundantly ſenſible
of all that I have ſaid above concerning the ſmall
fruit, if there is not a change in the face of affairs,
that is to be expected here.</p>
               <p>I can never perſuade my ſelf that this comes all
from <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe it would be a great ſhame if
it did. Your Lordſhip may believe, that they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
here that we are for delaying matters; which,
judging of us by themſelves, they think the Times
do oblige us to. I can write no more, my Pains
not ſuffering me to do it. May our Lord preſerve
your Lordſhip's moſt Reverend and Illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

               <p>The Letter your Lordſhip writ to the ſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
came very ſeaſonably, the Doctour eſteeming
it a great favour, as I do alſo, it being all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my health. It has been a great trouble to me
in my ſickneſs, that I have not been able to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
with the Electours, with whom I might have
done ſome ſervice; I hear, he of <hi>Mentz</hi> is reſolved
to depart, who will be followed by the other of
<hi>Triers; Mentz</hi> would be glad that there were no
Anſwer given to the Captain that he has ſent, and
I am of the mind, that His Majeſty and all that are
about him will not be able to keep him much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
here, or to cure him of the fears he is in of
thoſe ungovernable People; Wherefore the beſt way
would be to let them both go, leaving their Votes
and Powers in the Council with him of <hi>Cologne,</hi> who
is to remain. For ſhould it be known here, that
the Electours departed without having had an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
and leave from His Majeſty, the opinion they
have here of His Majeſty's Authority would be
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57465:143"/>
much leſſened thereby, both by the Electours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and the reſt of the <hi>Germans;</hi> but whatever
is done, it is expedient that an Anſwer be preſently
returned to the Electours, and to <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi>
who, as in all other Affairs, has taken a great deal
of pains in this, which he has conducted as he
ought to have done; <hi>Cologne</hi> continues as yet very
firm, I pray God his Companion's Example have
no ill influence upon him; <hi>Gregory Lopez</hi> kiſſes your

               <p>WIth the Letter was deliver'd to me by the
Laquey, I received a great favour, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received one for ſeveral Days before; your
Lordſhip ſeems to think, that I am perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered;
whereas, in truth, I have worſe Nights
now, than when the Phyſician left me, which he
did fifteen Days too ſoon for my health; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
I paid him magnificently, conſidering
my Poverty, and how <hi>Eraſtus</hi> uſeth me, I could not
keep him here any longer. I am in your Lordſhip's
debt, for the Money you ordered to be given to the
Poſts, which ſo ſoon as I am able ſhall be repay'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:57465:143"/>
Notwithſtanding I do not, nor am not able to
ſtir abroad, unleſs it be now and then to <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco</hi>
in the Night. I am informed nevertheleſs of all
that paſſeth, and when timely adviſed of things, do
give my opinion.</p>
               <p>As to the Envoys of <hi>Wittemburg,</hi> and <hi>Strasburg</hi>
deſiring to be heard; it is a thing in my mind, that
cannot in reaſon be denied, after having granted
them a general ſafe Conduct; and who, though they
ſhould deſire to have the Seſſion prorogued untill
they were heard to all things from the beginning,
ought to be gratified therein, and that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
a ſubmiſſion of them, or any other devices of
the Legates: for theſe being the firſt, it is of a great
moment, that they ſhould have no cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
or diſcontent given them; your Lordſhip
may believe me, the Legate is upon his Tricks,
ſtarting difficulties in every thing, and ſtudying
how to intimidate our Miniſters to that Degree,
that they ſhall not have the Courage to propoſe any
thing that is difficult to him, of whom in the moſt
eaſie and indifferent things, they have reaſon to be
jealous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> takes a very good way, in my mind,
with the Envoys of Duke <hi>Maurice,</hi> in reſpecting
and careſſing them as he does, in which he is aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
by <hi>Cologue,</hi> and <hi>Trent:</hi> It is very neceſſary to
uſe Artifice with them, as well as with their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
when he comes, for to put them into a good
Temper, and to oblige the Papalins to hear them,
and not to hunt after pretences to drive them away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And ſo, though, as I have ſaid, I cannot treat with
them; I ſhall nevertheleſs do all I can, and being
once recovered ſhall not be wanting in doing my
Duty.</p>

hold out well; it is certain that our Nation,
which is the greater part of this <hi>Junto,</hi> do want a

                  <hi>DON Franciſco</hi>'s Letter to His Majeſty will
acquaint your Lordſhip, with the great
ſtruglings they have had here with the Legate before
the Seſſion was held, as well about the Audience
of the Envoys of the Dukes of <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> and
<hi>Maurice,</hi> as about the ſafe Conduct, and the Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
thereof; <hi>Ubi in ſingulis eſt multum diuque labora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi>
in which, as indeed in all other Affairs, the
ſaid Embaſſadour takes much pains, having with a
wonderfull dexterity, carried a point in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Marquiſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> contrary to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57465:144"/>
the good liking of ſeveral of the Fathers. In all
which encounters with the Legate, the Senior Fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
has ſtill fallen upon wonderfull Expedients, who
being a Perſon of great Learning, and withall much
experienced in Affairs of this Nature, has not been
miſtaken in one ſingle point, as I am able to witneſs
for him, who though ſtill very weak, have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at all the Conſultations of the ſaid Embaſſadour
and Fiſcal.</p>
               <p>Among the things propoſed by the Envoys of
<hi>Wittemburg,</hi> there were ſeveral great points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and I am told, and do ſee it, that a
great Number of the Prelates, ſince they are not
permitted to propoſe any thing of that Nature
themſelves; are glad at their having been propoſed
by others, which they hope may give occaſion to the
reforming of ſeveral Abuſes, in giving His Majeſty
a handle whereby he may urge his Holineſs for to
conſent to it, by telling him, that ſince thoſe Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and Points of Reformation have been now ſo
publickly propoſed to the Council, that all <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
muſt ring of them, the Council cannot after
that with a good Conſcience, or in Honour, ſo far
neglect its Duty, as not to redreſs the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
of them, and which are ſo groſs, <hi>Ut in oculos
etiam puerorum incurrant;</hi> His Majeſty ought by no
means to loſe ſuch an opportunity as this, of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
home thoſe matters, and the rather, becauſe he
can loſe nothing by doing it, though he ſhould
have a deaf Ear turned to all his Remonſtrances.</p>
               <p>There is one thing I cannot forbear acquainting
you withall, which though it ought not to be
ſpoke of here for fear of ſpoiling the Game we are
now playing with the Proteſtants, ought to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
about with Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> when he comes. It
is that his Envoys and Lawyers who are here, do
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57465:145"/>
not only propoſe their Doctrines, and the Reaſons
they have for believing them, but do likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
Laws which they would have obſerved, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the Council to pronounce <hi>it ſelf ſuperiour to
the Pope,</hi> and to declare <hi>all the Prelates thereof to be
abſolved from all the Oaths they have taken</hi> to him,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now if when they propoſed ſuch things as
theſe, they had at the ſame time promiſed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
in all points to the judgment and determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Council, when poſſeſſed of ſuch an
Authority and Freedom, their having done it might
then have been tolerable, and not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable;
whereas for them, at the ſame time,
they propoſe ſuch Laws, to exempt themſelves from
the Juriſdiction of the Council, by making the
Scripture the ſole Judge of all their Controverſies,
appears to be both unjuſt and arrogant. It being
a bold thing in them in my opinion, and an indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their intending to propoſe nothing here,
but what has been ſaid by their Writers, that ſo
having given their Maſters ſome ſatisfaction by
their having come to the Council, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home with the ſame opinions they brought, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no other Power to the Council, than that of
ſpeaking to their matters. I thought it convenient
to acquaint your Lordſhip with this, that if you
ſhould think fit you might treat with <hi>Maurice,</hi> and
the other Proteſtants about it.</p>
               <p>The Procuratour <hi>Gualby,</hi> has writ to me to
put your Lordſhip in mind of allowing ſomething,
out of the vacant Benefices of <hi>Arragon,</hi> for the
maintenance of Students; it is certainly a very
good thing, and ought to be looked after, ſo that
your Lordſhip will do a thing worthy of your ſelf
in promoting it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:57465:145"/>
The Biſhop of <hi>Caſtellamar</hi> kiſſeth your Lordſhips
hands, and deſireth me to let you know, that it is
my being here, and the knowledge he has of your
Lordſhips being oppreſſed with buſineſs, that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
him from writing to you. I muſt tell your
Lordſhip, that he is one of the Prelates that han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
the matters of Doctrine, and the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
that are about them, with great Learning and
Accuracy; and who has had a long baniſhment here,
I muſt therefore intreat your Lordſhip to lay the
Merits of this Prelate before His Majeſty; and in
caſe he can have neither the Biſhoprick of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,
nor that which will be voided, to fill it,
that he may be tranſlated on the firſt occaſion to
ſome Church in <hi>Spain,</hi> which, being His Majeſty's
Chaplain, with ſo great Merits and Services, he
very well deſerves.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſay I am well, having bad Nights ſtill,
by reaſon of a pain in my Kidneys, and I am ſo
much broken, that I doubt I ſhall not recover my
ſtrength quickly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> has writ to His Majeſty to acquaint
him, with the great want the Prelates that are here,
and eſpecially the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> are in of a Phyſician of
our own Nation, and with ſome of our Theologues,
having died here for want of ſuch a one; I am told
he will deſire to have Doctour <hi>Gregory Lopez</hi> ſent
hither, who I believe will be glad of the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
I need not tell your Lordſhip how much I
am indebted to the ſaid Doctour, for the Journey
he took hither at your Lordſhip's Command; I do
therefore beſeech your Lordſhip to promote his
coming hither again, all you can, and the rather,
becauſe the Doctour is ſo near, and the Council is

                  <p>I had forgot to write to you concerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
that is raiſed here by a Clauſe in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Sacrament of Order, into which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever having had it diſputed, or ſo much as
communicated to the Prelates, they have foiſted in
the Authority of the Pope above the Council, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
as if there were no Office in the Church, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks
not excepted, that are not of his donation
and diſtribution, in contradiction both to the uſage
of the Primitive Church, and to the Truth of
things: But notwithſtanding this buſineſs—when
it was preſſed by the Legate, had a ſtop put
to it by a ſuſpenſion of thoſe matters, I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that the Legate deſigns to bring them ſpeedily
upon the Stage again, and particularly that Clauſe,
which will be of ſo great prejudice not only to <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
which after the Pope's Authority is once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be ſuperior to that of Councils, will never
have any regard for ſuch Aſſemblies, but to all
that part of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> likewiſe, which follows the
Concluſion of the Synods of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi>
which the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>France</hi> do. I am of opinion, that ſo weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
a matter as this is, ought not to be handled <hi>Ex
incidenti,</hi> but <hi>De propoſito;</hi> and at the End of the
Council, though conſidering the inconveniencies
which will attend its being any ways determined,
it would certainly be the beſt courſe not to meddle
with it at all. But the Legate ſeeing a great many
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57465:146"/>
Dominicans here, and a great Number of Spaniſh
Prelates, who do generally follow St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> he is
very earneſt to have it propoſed again; hoping he
may be able to carry it in the Council: It is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a very unſeaſonable thing, ſo that it would be
well if there were an Order againſt medling with
it in this Conjuncture, ſince the determination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
will infallibly drive away the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the Authority of the Decrees of the Council
in a great many Provinces; I do ſuppoſe <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco</hi>
will write to His Majeſty about this.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOur Lordſhip, in what you ſay of the Fiſcal,
is certainly in the right, it being no more
than what I have always known of him. I am in
his debt for the good Office he did me, in reciting
the Calendar to his Majeſty, wherein I do believe
that might happen to him that is ſaid of <hi>Cicero,</hi> the
Flower of Orators, that he was come to the Lees;
nevertheleſs, I thank him as much as if he had drawn
nothing but pure Wine out of it.</p>
               <p>The Reſolution he has brought is extreamly well
concerted, and the moſt convenient for our affairs that
could poſſibly have been made; and it appears ſo to
the Elector of <hi>Cologne,</hi> to whom I reported it, as it
did alſo to <hi>Mentz;</hi> nevertheleſs, as your Lordſhip
will ſee by <hi>Don Franciſco</hi>'s Letter, the Legate will
do all that is poſſible to defeat it, and eſpecially if
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſhould come: He ſeems to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
it already, by having adjourned the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
untill he has received an Anſwer from the Pope,
and for to imagine that we ſhall ever have any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
made here, in any thing that comes determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from <hi>Rome,</hi> is to look after the fifth Foot of a
Ship. I have from the Elector of <hi>Cologne</hi> acquainted
the Embaſſadour with the Meſſage that was ſent
him by the Legate; which was, That he believed the
Council would not proceed, notwithſtanding he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
all he could to keep it on foot: He has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
likewiſe to drop ſome words, as if the <hi>Italian</hi>
Biſhops would not be perſuaded to tarry any longer,
if a Seſſion were not held; when, at the ſame time,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57465:147"/>
it is manifeſt, that it is he that hinders it by delays:
Pray God grant them a better mind, than I have
hitherto been able for to obſerve in them.</p>
               <p>Whatever your Lordſhip ſhall do for the Biſhop
of <hi>Caſtellamar,</hi> will certainly be well beſtowed, as
will alſo what you ſhall do for Father <hi>Abbot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon Doctour <hi>Olivares</hi> going with the Queen,
We gave over all hopes of having <hi>Gregory Lopez</hi> ſent
to us, which was no ſmall trouble to the Council,
in which the Biſhops have diſtempers enough, but
have not one Phyſician to take care of their health.
I begin now, God be praiſed for it, to recover in
earneſt, though I have a defluxion ſtill that falls
every Morning from my Head down into my Neck
with no ſmall pain, which growing every Day leſs I
take to be a good ſign: <hi>Eraſtus</hi> when he was here,
promiſed that when he returned from <hi>Spain,</hi> he
would diſpatch that buſineſs of mine; I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
intreat your Lordſhip to command him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it, that it may according to his promiſe be
diſpatched by the next Currier that goes to <hi>Spain.</hi>

               <p>THE multitude of buſineſs we have always,
juſt before the Seſſion, and the ſhortneſs of
time we are allowed to do it in, hindered me till
now from returning Anſwers to your Lordſhips Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
which I ſhall now do to them all four of the
9th, 12th, 20th, and 23th of the laſt Month: As
to the firſt, which gives an account of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
being come with your Family in health to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpurg;</hi>
your Lordſhip has no Servant that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
more at it than I do; nay, I ſpeak modeſtly in
not affirming that I do rejoyce more than any of
them, as well for ſome reaſons I have formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated;
as, becauſe the nigher I am to your
Lordſhip I am the better ſatisfied, and eſpecially if
it ſhould ſo happen, that I ſhould be commanded
to come to Court, your Lordſhip having promiſed
you would remember me, whenever the Affair of
<hi>Pomblin</hi> ſhall come to be treated of, which, for
ſome reaſons I have formerly given your Lordſhip,
I do infinitely deſire to ſee concluded to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of both Parties; I can tell your Lordſhip
nothing that is new relating to that buſineſs no
body knowing the whole Merits thereof, and all
that has been done in it for ſeveral Years, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
as you do: Wherefore being ſenſible how
well your Lordſhip ſtands affected to the concerns
of the Duke of <hi>Florence.</hi> I will not ſpend words
in ſupplicating, but ſhall remit the whole thereof
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57465:148"/>
to the prudence and juſtice wherewith your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
manageth buſineſs; and ſo expecting your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
Commands about it, I ſhall ſay no more at
preſent.</p>
               <p>As to the precedency of the Doctours that are
here, in His Majeſty's Name, we ſhall follow your
Lordſhip's Order therein, it having formerly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to us, to be very inconvenient for His
Majeſty's Service, that there ſhould be any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
or diſputes among them; and being ſtill of
the ſame mind, we do at this time obſerve that
Order: Monſieur <hi>de Poitours,</hi> and I, whenever there
was the leaſt pretenſion betwixt them, having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
commanded them to ſpeak according to the
Seniority of their Degrees.</p>
               <p>I have performed that Office to the Electours,
His Majeſty commanded, which Order I know
your Lordſhip muſt have ſeen, by the advice you
gave thereof, ſince the doing whereof I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
they are all extreamly ſatisfied with His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Will in that point.</p>
               <p>As to what your Lordſhip writes concerning
your being ſatisfied with the Conduct, of the Fiſcal
<hi>Vargas,</hi> it gives me great content, knowing him to
be one of the moſt learned and beſt qualified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of his profeſſion, and withall very zealous for
His Majeſty's Service, and much devoted to your
Lordſhip. Your Lordſhip is therefore bound to
favour him with His Majeſty, and to ſee that he be
rewarded according to his Merits and Services,
which I ſhall take as a great kindneſs, he being a
Perſon for whom I have a particular affection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much beholden to him for the aſſiſtance he has
afforded me; if which your Lordſhip takes notice.
In a word, he is certainly ſuch an Original as is not
to be quoted again. I have made your Lordſhip's
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57465:149"/>
Apology, and in caſe I ſucceed I ſhall adviſe you
of it.</p>
               <p>As to the affair of the Houſes, I was buſie about
it ſome days before I received your Lordſhip's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which commanded me to take care, that the
Synod was not impoſed upon by the Taxers; with
whom, as alſo with the Country People, I have
laboured to concert things, and have brought it
near an iſſue; and having granted both to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
and the Conciliaries all that they pretended
to, I have erected a Court to give ſatisfaction to all
Parties for what is paſt, the Deputies whereof are
at this inſtant going about in great Unanimity to
view the Houſes, which they tax in Conformity to
an Agreement we are come to. I take all the care
I can in this and every thing elſe, to ſatisfie the
Prelates, and not to ſuffer the People of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to exact upon them. Our Lord protect and
proſper your Lordſhip's moſt illuſtrious Perſon and
State.</p>

to return in Anſwer, only that I kiſs your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
hands a thouſand times, for the favour you
did me therein, in acquainting me with your health,
which being the beſt News I can receive, I ſhould
be glad to hear of it hourly. <hi>Eraſtus</hi> paſſed through
this place, but made no ſtay, being in haſte, as he
told me, to be at <hi>Milan.</hi> His Journey has furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Prelates that are here, with matter for a
great deal of Diſcourſe, who though I have aſſured
them they are miſtaken in their Gueſſes about it,
will not believe me: I am waiting for His Majeſty's
Anſwer to all that I have laid before him, if it does
not come quickly we ſhall be involved in great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
having a great many things to think, and
treat of before the Seſſion, and ſhall have but little
time to do it in. I am ſenſible that there is no need
of putting your Lordſhip, who underſtand the Legate's
method ſo well, in mind of this, nevertheleſs for
my own ſatisfaction, I could not forbear deſiring it.
The Report that the Electours are about departing
has made a great change here, of which my thoughts
are, that as they are neither ſatisfied with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for having come hither, nor with their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſtayed, ſo it is to be feared that they will
make uſe of this, or ſome other occaſion to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
Now this of their ſtaying or going being a
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57465:150"/>
matter of ſo great moment, it will be neceſſary
that we ſhould preſently know His Majeſty's Mind
about it; but your Lordſhip is too ſenſible of the
Weight of this Affair, not to employ all your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
therein. The Legate has diſpatched a Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
to his Holineſs about this change, who I dare
ſay will not be ſorry at their going away. Our

to the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> died here yeſterday
of an intermitting Fever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which begins to ſpread in
theſe parts; he died Chriſtianly, having ordered
his Body to be carried to his own Country, which
for the preſent is depoſited here in the great Church,
to which it was accompanied by the whole Synod,
excepting the Legate, who was hindered by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
from aſſiſting at the Solemnity: I ſent to
know how he did, and had word brought me, that
he has for ſeven or eight Nights been troubled with
a fit of a Fever, which has brought him low, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57465:150"/>
that he is extreamly melancholy and diſcontented:
he has locked himſelf up, and does not care that
any body ſhould ſee him: I am apt to believe, the
jealouſies he has conceived of the Affairs at <hi>Rome,</hi>
are the chief Cauſe of his Illneſs. For I am told
he has received advice, of the Pope's making more
uſe of ſome of the new Cardinals, than he would
have had him: Which, knowing the eaſineſs of the
Pope's temper, has put him into a great fright. I
muſt intreat your Lordſhip again to diſpatch the
Fiſcal with all poſſible expedition, for the reaſons I
have formerly given, as I do alſo, that you would
ſend Dr. <hi>Gregory Lopez</hi> to us quickly, who is every

The Meſſengers of the Marquiſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi>
have given us great ſatisfaction, whoſe Maſter, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſubmitted himſelf in earneſt to all the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of the Council, has given a good Example,
ſo that ſhould the Count <hi>Palatine, Maurice</hi> and
<hi>Wittenburg,</hi> but do the ſame when they come, we
ſhould recover perfect hopes of remedy.</p>
               <p>Every thing has been done in this Seſſion, that
His Majeſty had ordered, and in my judgment as
was moſt convenient, only one thing excepted, and
againſt which I gave my Vote, which was its being
declared in the laſt Canon, that Sacramental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
is neceſſary to be made before the Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which, though in it ſelf very juſt and certain;
nevertheleſs, ſince we are in the next Seſſion to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
Sacramental Confeſſion, and to argue whether
Vocal Confeſſion is neceſſary, and whether it is of
Divine Right, and who is the Miniſter thereof. I
ſay, ſince all this is then to be treated of and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
I was againſt having had it declared in this
Seſſion, that Confeſſion was daily neceſſary, and the
rather, becauſe it has not as yet been declared to
be ſo annually. For though it is probable, that
they who are to argue it, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> may make
no difficulty in that point, nevertheleſs I was for
having every thing that related to Sacramental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
determined in the next Seſſion; Firſt as to
all its Generals, and afterwards as to all its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
whereas the Proteſtants will now ſay, that
there is no room left for them to diſpute about it,
ſince it is already declared in this to be neceſſary:
but ſince my Vote did not take effect, I will believe
that what has been done was beſt.</p>
               <p>As to what concerns a Reformation, His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Aſſiſtance will be found to be neceſſary to it,
who muſt ſet himſelf about it in earneſt, both with
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57465:152"/>
the Pope and the Fathers, for if he does not, we
ſhall have our Wounds only skinned over, but ſhall
have the rotten Core left to the corrupting of all
quickly again; for my own part, I cannot ſee nor
perceive any thing that looks like warmth for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in the Preſidents; On the contrary, they have
told us plainly that we muſt accept of what they will
be pleaſed to give us, without offering to ſpeak a
word for any more; this is enough to let your moſt
Reverend Lordſhip ſee, what is moſt convenient to
be done for God's, and His Majeſty's Service, and
you are to know farther, that the Prelates here are
all very much troubled to ſee, with how ill a Grace,
People that ſay any thing of a Reformation are
heard.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the ſafe
Conduct of the Proteſtants, are conformable to
what His Majeſty had ordered, and ſo ſhall every
thing be to the Commands he ſhall ſend. God

               <p>IN your Illuſtrious Lordſhip's laſt Letter to me
of the Ninth of <hi>November,</hi> I received a ſignal
Favour, as I ſhall always do in knowing, that I am
capable of ſerving your Lordſhip. It was a great
Service of His Majeſty, the Embaſſadours acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us withall, <hi>viz.</hi> His Majeſty's having ordered,
that nothing be treated of that ſhall be to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of the Prelates, by which means all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
that was here about Benefices, is turned to
other matters, which they call a Reformation, as
your Lordſhip will ſee by the Canons which are
ſent by the Embaſſadours, of which we accepted;
becauſe as your Illuſtrious Lordſhip had wiſely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed,
it is neceſſary we ſhould tread warily, and at
preſent accept of what they will give us. But the
miſchief is, that they are ſenſible of this our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and ſo do diſcover little or no inclination for
to do any thing, that deſerves the Name of a true
Reformation; notwithſtanding, as your Lordſhip
well obſerves, ſeveral things might be done, that
would be of great advantage to the People, and
would be no prejudice to His Holineſs, or to his
Court: May God remedy things, under whom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
His Majeſty and your Illuſtrious Lordſhip do la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
very hard, there will be no remedy left for the
Church.</p>
               <p>I have preſumed to adviſe your Illuſtrious Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
of what at preſent occurs, upon your having
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57465:153"/>
given me leave to do it; and becauſe I am willing
to prevent diſturbances in this holy <hi>Junto,</hi> ſo long
as they will do any thing for the good of the
Church: For, though, I do hope there will be no
ſuch diſturbance; it is requiſite, nevertheleſs, that
His Majeſty and your Illuſtrious Lordſhip, ſhould
be acquainted with every thing, great and ſmall,
that happens here, that you may be the better able
to judge, whether, what ſhall be done, ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable

you to the Memorial I have ſent.</p>
               <p>I need not acquaint your Illuſtrious Lordſhip,
with the great Obligations I am under, to be a

how I am engaged beyond all others, to wait upon
him to kiſs his Hand; and ſo having after the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
was over, obtained leave of the Legate, and

to go as far as <hi>Mantua,</hi> with the moſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

ſpend many Days in going and coming, I thought
fit to give your Lordſhip an account thereof, to let

               <p>WHat the Biſhop of <hi>Oren</hi> ſaith is, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
His Majeſty has ordered, that in the
Affair of the Proviſion of Benefices, nothing ſhould
be done to the prejudice of the Prelates, and has
likewiſe ſent hither ſeveral Heads relating to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
in order to have them decreed; that,
notwithſtanding, among the ſaid Heads there are
ſome particulars, that are not very reaſonable, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
they are ſuch as are not of the ſubſtance of
the Reformation of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:57465:154"/>
There was one Chapter the Legate was for having
enacted by the Synod, which was that, that ordered
that no Biſhoprick nor other Benefice, ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in <hi>Commendam</hi> to any Perſon not of full Age,
which though in it ſelf a very juſt thing; many of
the Fathers were againſt having decreed, becauſe it
would ſeem to approve of Cardinals, Laicks, and
others, provided they were of full Age, holding of
Benefices in <hi>Commendam:</hi> For which reaſon moſt of
us were of opinion, That, that Head ought not to
be paſſed into a Decree, leſt under a colour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
<hi>Commendams</hi> we ſhould eſtabliſh them.
There was a certain Biſhop, ſtyled the Biſhop of
<hi>Verdun,</hi> who is a Suffragan of <hi>Triers,</hi> who ſpeaking
of the Reformation ſaid, that this Chapter did not
appear to him to be convenient, calling it farther a
pretended Reformation; for which words of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reformation, the Legate fell foul upon him
the other day, mortifying him with hard and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
words, before all the Fathers, telling him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other things, that he did not underſtand
what he ſaid: The Biſhop was ſilent, but having
offered the other day to ſpeak, and to have ſaid
ſomething in his own juſtification, the Legate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to hold his Tongue, and not to ſpeak
to any thing, but what he ſhould command him to
ſpeak to: The Biſhop made anſwer, that at this
rate there was nothing of liberty, and that having
obtained leave of His Majeſty, by whom he was ſent
hither, he would be gone; the Legate told him he
ſhould not go, but ſhould do what they comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him: This paſſed at a Congregation, at which
all the Embaſſadours were preſent.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhops of <hi>Cologne</hi> and <hi>Mentz</hi> talked
much to one another about it, and he of <hi>Cologne</hi>
turning about to the Biſhop of <hi>Oren,</hi> who ſat near
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57465:154"/>
him, ſaid, my Lord Biſhop tell me the truth, Do
you think there is any thing of liberty in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil?
The Biſhop of <hi>Oren</hi> made anſwer, Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
asks me a dangerous queſtion, and which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
preſently anſwer, only, that a Council ought
to be free. Whereupon he of <hi>Cologne</hi> replied, My
queſtion to you is, whether this Council appears to
you to be free? To which he of <hi>Oren</hi> anſwered, I do
beg your Lordſhip not to preſs me any farther on
that point, in this place, promiſing to let him have
my thoughts of it at his own Houſe. After which
the Electours began to ſpeak to one another again,
and as I do ſuppoſe about the ſame Affair.</p>
               <p>The other day the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Diſcourſe thereof again at his own
Houſe, expreſſing great diſſatisfaction at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
injoying ſo little liberty, and at there being no
remembrance almoſt of a Reformation, and at the
ſmall account was made here of the learned Men,
and Divines, who have no hand in the Canons, but
by delivering their opinions in publick concerning
Hereſies; whereas, that the chief Divines ſhould
be called, and adviſed with about the framing of the
Canons, is a thing that we do all deſire. So that it is
to be feared, that if in the next Seſſion, they are not
more in earneſt about a Reformation, than hitherto
they have been, that either the Electours or ſome
others, who do not reckon it to be convenient to
ſuffer things to go on thus, will raiſe a diſturbance;
every body being diſpleaſed at nothing being done
towards the Reformation of the Church, no not in
ſuch things as might be reformed without doing
any prejudice to his Holineſs, and but very little to
his Court, and which would be of great advantage
to the People; to the great reproach of all us Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
from whom the World expects Canons of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57465:155"/>
Reformation, though in truth, we can give them
nothing but what the Legate pleaſes.</p>
               <p>I thought fit to adviſe hereof, being apprehenſive
of what may happen, if at the next Seſſion they do
not treat about more ſubſtantial matters: For tho' I
do not doubt but that the Electours, and others, will
do whatſoever His Majeſty ſhall order, it is convenient
nevertheleſs, that His Majeſty ſhould be adviſed of ſuch
things, as may hereafter be of very ill conſequence;
and whereas the Legate, when he ſhall come to ſee
how much reſpect is paid to His Majeſty's Order,
may ſuffer nothing to be ſpoke to, but as he ſhall
think fit, he having on all ſuch occaſions threatned
to be gone, and throw all up; it is therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for the preventing of a diſturbance, that his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
ſhould be urged with great warmth to ſend
ſomething to us, that will be of ſome advantage to
the People, it being a burning ſhame to throw the
blame of all this upon the Biſhops; who tho' they
may not truly be in the fault, will be reckoned to be
ſo, and it will be but juſt in the People, if we do
not treat about their intereſt, more in earneſt, than
we have done hitherto, for to ſtone us when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home.</p>
               <p>It is agreed, that the Affair <hi>Sub utraque ſpecie,</hi>
ſhall be handled with that of Order, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Maſs in the next Seſſion, and ſince the
<hi>Lutherans,</hi> whom we expected are not as yet come;
it would be convenient, That that of <hi>Sub utraque
ſpecie,</hi> ſhould be adjourned to the laſt Seſſion: His
Majeſty may command whatſoever he judges to be
moſt expedient This ſerving only to adviſe of
things, to the beſt of my underſtanding, as a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Servant.</p>

few bad things, delivered ſo many that were good,
that it was well the People did not hear them: by
whom ſeveral Heads of Reformation having been
propoſed, we the Biſhops do deſire to have leave to
anſwer them Chapter by Chapter, reckoning we
may thereby be able to do ſervice. I do acquaint
your Illuſtrious Lordſhip with this, becauſe I hear
the Legate and others, are for having us anſwer all
that relates to a Reformation, only in general, that
we may not be able to do any thing but what they
ſhall judge convenient; but as the returning of ſuch

which Subject they have not done ſo much as was
convenient for the Reformation of the Catholick
Church, and for the removing of the Offences
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57465:157"/>
which gave occaſion to Peoples falling into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours:
We for our parts, did all they would give
us leave to do, though not ſo much as was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
or as we deſired to have done, to my great
trouble; I do therefore beſeech your Lordſhip, to
let His Majeſty know how little Decrees againſt
Hereſies will ſignifie, if the great Abuſes which were
the occaſion of them be not redreſſed. This is a
thing His Majeſty ought to go about with that
zeal and warmth, wherewith it was handled in a
Congregation of this Council; and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as the hopes we have given us, that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
will take care of ſuch things are a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to us, ſo they have kept us from making that
oppoſition that was neceſſary for People who are to
give an account to God of what they ſhall do here;
I do not write to His Majeſty concerning this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I do not care to be troubleſome, and do rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
it to be the ſame thing to acquaint your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
therewith. I do beg it of your Lordſhip that
you would make uſe of my ſervice, ſince there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
I am ſo ambitious of, as of ſerving you in all
things, whoſe moſt Illuſtrious and Reverend Perſon
may our Lord preſerve, and increaſe your State
for his own holy Service, and the good of the
Church.</p>

               <p>AFter having writ the Letter that goes with this,
as they do both with the Senior Fiſcal, who I
am certain will deliver them: My being ſenſible
how much you delight in being kind to your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
has encouraged me, to beg ſome farther Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of you.</p>
               <p>The caſe, moſt Reverend Lord, is, in <hi>Spain</hi> they
demand the Subſidy, which the Pope granted to
His Majeſty on the fruits of the Churches, for the
Year 1549 only; which ought accordingly to have
been raiſed out of thoſe fruits. Now, moſt Reverend
Lord, in the Year 1549, I neither was a Biſhop,
nor dreamt of being one, it being the 27th of <hi>June
1550,</hi> on which day my Church was propoſed at
<hi>Rome,</hi> before I was a Biſhop. Now it appears to
me to be a very hard thing, that they ſhould make
me pay for that, that I never injoyed, and that he
that received it, who, was <hi>Don Antonio de Fonſeca,</hi>
my Predeceſſour, ſhould be excuſed; and eſpecially
conſidering, that he has ſtill more from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick
than I have; to this they anſwer, that I
muſt pay the Subſidy, and afterwards come upon
him for it. Now what reaſon can there be, for my
paying what I do not owe, and if I do pay it,
whereon ſhall I have to live? It would certainly be
much more juſt, conſidering how the Biſhoprick is
loaded, and my great Poverty, to exempt me from
that Subſidy; there not being a Biſhop in <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:57465:158"/>
that has ſo many reaſons for to be exempted as I
have; I muſt therefore ſupplicate your Lordſhip to
favour your Servants as you uſe to do, when there
is ſo much cauſe for it.</p>
               <p>Another thing, is, His Majeſty was pleaſed to
let me keep the Penſion of <hi>Carthagena;</hi> but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
thereof commanded me to pay 400 Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats
to one <hi>Eſpinola</hi> of <hi>Genoua;</hi> and whereas I paid
the ſaid Ducats in broad Money, the Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagena</hi>
will not pay me, but in Ducats <hi>de Camara</hi>
according to their antient Value; notwithſtanding
by an Order that I ſaw, His Majeſty commanded
him to pay <hi>Don Sancho de Caſtilla,</hi> His Majeſty's
Chaplain, in broad Money; and I am told by Dr.
<hi>Malvenda,</hi> likewiſe, that he is commanded by His
Majeſty to pay all that he is in Arrear, ſince he had
that Biſhoprick, in large Ducats; I muſt therefore
intreat your Lordſhip to procure ſuch an Order
for me, which I ſhall eſteem as a ſignal Favour.
May our Lord proſper your Lordſhip's moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
and Reverend Perſon, for many Years, and
increaſe your State, as your Servants deſire.</p>

               <p>I Have by divers Letters acquainted your Illuſtrious
Lordſhip with what has paſſed concerning a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
called the Hoſpitalery in the Church of <hi>Pamplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
which became void by the Death of the Licentiate
<hi>Don Martin de Aguierre,</hi> a profeſſed Canon of the
Order of St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> to which Dignity in conformity
to the Statutes, and Rights of the ſaid Church, I did
by my Vicar on the 7th of <hi>December</hi> laſt, collate <hi>Don
Martin de Sant Ander,</hi> a Man of a good Life, and
Learning, and withall a Preacher. I have likewiſe
informed your Illuſtrious Lordſhip, how great a
prejudice it will be, not only, to the ſaid Church,
but to the City, and whole Kingdom, if that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
ſhould be given to any one that is not a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
the deceaſed having founded a College for
fourteen poor Students, who are to have their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Diet, and Teaching <hi>gratis,</hi> which was a very
neceſſary Work, there not being a Study in the
whole Kingdom: The Foundation of the Colledge
was laid before I left <hi>Pamplona,</hi> ſo that there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing but his Holineſs, and Majeſty's conſent
to it: Now the greateſt part of this Endowment,
being raiſed out of the Revenues of the ſaid Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
ſhould any one that is not a Canon be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to it, the College will come to nothing;
Whereas, if a Canon has it, it will hold. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
all the Dignities of <hi>Pamplona,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,
ſhould this be given to one that is no Canon,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57465:160"/>
he will receive the profits, without doing the
Church any ſervice; ſince, without being a Canon
he cannot go into the Quire, and ſo will be as
a Woolf in eating the profits without ſerving
God.</p>
               <p>Now having received information that the ſaid
Dignity is expoſed to Sale at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee who
will give moſt for it (a very honourable Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the Council we are in) I could not both
for His Majeſty's Service, and the diſcharge of my
own Conſcience, forbear acquainting His Majeſty
therewith, ſupplicating him to defend his own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage,
and not to ſuffer the ſaid Church, City,
and Kingdom, to have ſuch a wrong done them,
on which occaſion, and to kiſs your Illuſtrious
Lordſhip's Hands, I have ſent this by a Servant,
and with it a Memorial to his Majeſty, in which I
give him a full Account of the caſe; wherefore, I
muſt beſeech your Lordſhip, notwithſtanding the
Biſhop may not deſerve it, to let the ſaid Holy
Church, and Kingdom, for to have your favour,
and that you would not deny it to them, that ſo
they may never forget your Illuſtrious Lordſhip in
their Sacrifices and Prayers, as their Benefactour,
which, as your Lordſhip's Servant, and Prelate of
the ſaid Church, I do promiſe you they ſhall not.
But beſides the Conclaviſt, whom I mention in the
Memorial, I hear that Senior <hi>Balduino Monte,</hi> his
Holineſs's Brother, pretends to give that Dignity
to I do not know whom. Your Illuſtrious Lordſhip
would do me a great favour, if you would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to write to him, that the Church of <hi>Pamplona,</hi>
and the Ordinary thereof may not be wronged,
which kindneſs would be very much inhanſed, if
His Majeſty would write likewiſe to the ſaid <hi>Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
about it, and would charge his Embaſſadour,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57465:161"/>
                  <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza,</hi> to look after it. I beſeech
your Lordſhip to have compaſſion on the Biſhop,
who is your Lordſhip's, and that holy Church,
City, and Kingdom's Creature.</p>
               <p>I had writ thus far when your Lordſhip's Letter
of the 17th inſtant came to my Hand, by the way
of Dr. <hi>Malvenda,</hi> with which I received a ſignal
Favour, and which is greater than I am able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
in underſtanding thereby how well diſpoſed your
moſt Reverend Lordſhip is to do me any kindneſs;
May God give me ſtrength to be able to ſerve your
Lordſhip, as much as I am bound, and am willing
to ſerve you. As to the Letters to which your
Lordſhip has received no Anſwer, to that which
was of greateſt importance, I returned an Anſwer
by the way of Dr. <hi>Malvenda,</hi> and to the firſt by the
Biſhop of <hi>Oviedo,</hi> and it goes to my very Soul, that
your Lordſhip did not receive them.</p>
               <p>As to the Dignity, having as your Lordſhip will
ſee, writ concerning it, before I received your
Lordſhip's Letter, I have nothing to add, but only
to ſupplicate your Lordſhip again, to do me the
Favour therein that I have deſired.</p>
               <p>And as to the Subſidy, the beſt way that I can
think of for the payment of it, is to make me Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of the Band of one and twenty Penſioners, with
the ſeven thouſand Ducats I am owing to them,
and with my great Poverty, and the other Debts I
have upon me; and if this will not do, for the
payment of what I do not injoy, I believe a Letter
from your Lordſhip, to the Biſhop of <hi>Lugo,</hi> might
go a great way towards it, to whom your moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Lordſhip may be pleaſed to write, that ſince
my Predeceſſour <hi>Don Antonio de Fonſeca,</hi> received
all the Fruits of thoſe Years, and who at this time
receives more Rent out of the Biſhoprick than I do,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57465:161"/>
that it is but juſt that he that owes it, and not he
who does not, ſhould pay it: As to what your
Lordſhip writes concerning the Shedule of <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena,</hi>
I do kiſs your Lordſhip's Hands for that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and do beg it of your Lordſhip, that you
would command it to be done, wherein your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
will do me both a favour and juſtice, and that
without doing any injury to the Biſhop: I do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
kiſs your moſt Reverend Hands, for the Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
you promiſe to do me with the Legate, and
with ſome other Perſons; and I do beſeech your
moſt Reverend Lordſhip, when you write to the
Legate, to mention the Church of <hi>Pamplona</hi> to him,
and that it may not be wronged: I am much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with the laſt Article, in your moſt Reverend
Lordſhip's Letter. I pray God the diſpatch the
Fiſcal is to bring, may be for his Service, and that
of His Majeſty, and the quiet of <hi>Germany.</hi> May

with the wrong they are about to do the Biſhop
of <hi>Pamplona,</hi> and to whom a greater cannot be
done, and not to him only, but to that Church,
and Kingdom, on an account of the College; but
being ſenſible how forward your Lordſhip is to do
favours, I cannot forbear begging of you; <hi>Nam ut

ubi de dantis miſericordia non dubitatur:</hi> For which
reaſon I do return to ſupplicate your moſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Lordſhip for to ſtand our friend; and ſince
delays in ſuch caſes are very dangerous, I who am
your Lordſhip's Creature, would eſteem it a great
Kindneſs if you would be pleaſed to write to the
Legate about this Affair, and to let him know how
unreaſonable a thing it is, in the time of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
inſtead of a Reformation, to help us to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and eſpecially, when the Biſhop of the
place is ſerving God, and His Majeſty at it, and at
a greater expence than he is able to bear; it will
be neceſſary likewiſe, that your Lordſhip ſhould,
with His Majeſty's Letters, write one your ſelf to
the Embaſſadour <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza,</hi> which if
it is not diſpatched quickly will, I fear, come too
late.</p>
               <p>And that your moſt Reverend Lordſhip may
have a perfect knowledge of the wrong, that will
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57465:163"/>
be done thereby to the Biſhop, the Church, and
the whole Kingdom; your Lordſhip is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that in former times, when <hi>Navarre</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
petty Kings, who had ſcarce Bread to put in
their Mouths, the Popes never offered to diſpoſe of
any Preferment therein, and eſpecially in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral
Church, in all which times there is no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
of their having done any ſuch thing; and ſhall
we now, when under ſo powerfull a King, and who
is ſo well able to defend his Kingdoms, endure to
have ſuch things impoſed upon us, as thoſe petty
Kings would never have ſuffered? Now were there
nothing elſe but this, I think, it is enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
your Lordſhip to defend me, and that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>I forgot to tell your Lordſhip in my former, that
the <hi>French</hi> Licentiate is my Enemy, though I do
not know for what, unleſs it be for his being a
friend to <hi>Verio,</hi> who is one of the Council, and
beſides Archdeacon, and Canon of the Church:
This <hi>Verio</hi> having forgot that it is his Office to do
juſtice, and hinder all Violences, abuſeth the Royal
Authority, in doing them himſelf, and in having
turned a Procuratour for all deſperate Cauſes; with
whom, being armed with the Royal Authority, no

write to the ſaid <hi>French</hi> Licentiate, to favour my

not coming to this place, where I am apt to
think, the baſe Courſes that are taken here, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
a Reformation, might have killed you. The
<hi>French</hi> do carry themſelves more ſincerely and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly
than the reſt, who do for that reaſon laugh
at them when they ſee them in trouble. When
we arrived here, they were handling the Sacrament
of Order, on which occaſion the <hi>Spaniards</hi> preſſed
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57465:166"/>
hard to have had it declared, that Biſhops were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
by Chriſt, and were by Divine Right ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
to Presbyters, in which the <hi>French</hi> joyned
with them: But the <hi>Italians,</hi> in order to hinder
the Eſtabliſhment of that Doctrine, crowded no
fewer than twelve Titles for the Pope into one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Canon, by which they pretend that he is the
only Biſhop inſtituted immediately by Chriſt, and
that all other Biſhops have no Authority but what
they derive from him; there is not one here that
does not wiſh himſelf in the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> though it were
with hazard of his Life. It is not poſſible for me,
to relate minutely to you all the Acts that I have
ſeen, and have been informed of in this Council.</p>

               <p>I Do all I can, that you may have quick Anſwers
to your Letters, but by reaſon of His Majeſty's
having ſo much buſineſs on his Hands, as he has
at preſent, you have them not many times ſo ſoon
as I do wiſh you had; and though at this time, the
badneſs of the ways, and our being ſo much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57465:168"/>
in raiſing an Army, might excuſe our
not doing of it, nevertheleſs the Anſwers to the
Embaſſadours, do want only to be ſeen by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;
and I will do all that I am able, that they
may be diſpatched in a few days.</p>
               <p>What you write of the Legate, and Preſidents
precipitating of things, is very true, who do hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
things ſtrangely, that are of the higheſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to the Church of God, of which the Legate
gave a clear proof, in having contended ſo much,
againſt having the Communion <hi>Sub utraque</hi> defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and in having determined many things in the
Seſſion, which ought to have been adjourned untill the
Arrival of the Proteſtants, who are now on their way:
But the miſchief of all is, that they do all thoſe
things for purpoſes, that are flatly contrary to the
purpoſes they ought to have; precipitating the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
ſo, that they have not time for arguing of
matters as they ought to do.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty has writ to his Embaſſadours to have
all theſe things remedied, if it is poſſible: The
Legate may reckon as he pleaſeth, but I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that for all the haſte he makes, he will be
obliged to prolong his Term of <hi>July,</hi> and that for
ſome Months. There goes likewiſe a particular
Anſwer to <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> in relation to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Memorial you ſpeak of, I have not as yet been
able to find, I imagined <hi>Velaſco</hi> had had it: We
muſt therefore leave it to you, to anſwer it as well
as you can in general, for want of a particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
thereof.</p>
               <p>It is a lamentable thing to be ſo ſenſible of Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
as to ſee them plainly, and yet not be able
to remedy them in the Circumſtances we are in;
My only conſolation is, the conſideration of my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57465:169"/>
done all that I was able, and of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Hand of God: Who many times, when
People do in humane Prudence deſpair of things,
puts his Hand to them, and brings them about:
Now my being of opinion, that we are at this time,
in ſuch an Extremity, is what raiſeth ſuch hopes in
me.</p>
               <p>Some of the Proteſtants are now on their way,
and ſome, as you write, are come already; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
by their ſecret workings in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
I do ſee plainly, that this is all a piece of
Roguery lodged in the Hearts of their Doctours
I do all the Offices, I can think of, with the Biſhop
of <hi>Imola</hi> his Holineſs's <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and that, in order
to bring the Pope to yield to ſome things that are
neceſſary; I do likewiſe ſollicite the Legate that is
here, who being an honeſt Man, cannot forbear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging,
that the Affairs of the Council ought
to be taken otherwiſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> than they are:
Where, if they would, they might conſent to the
doing of a great many things, that would be of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
and particularly to their own Authority,
and that without doing any body a prejudice.</p>
               <p>There is not a Soul that knows any thing of the
Letter you writ to me privately, nor of your having
ſent me the Papers, which our Embaſſadours were
ſo ſlow in ſending: I had heard of what had paſſed
from a thouſand particular Perſons, before their
Letters arrived: I ſhall take care, that the good
Offices you do me, ſhall be no prejudice to you,
and am glad that we are ſo near one another, that
we may almoſt ſhake Hands.</p>
               <p>As to your own particular Affairs, I have always
done, and will always do you all the good Offices
that are in my power; I pray God they may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
according to the good Will they are done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57465:169"/>
I was glad to hear from you, of Dr. <hi>Malven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>'s
having acquitted himſelf ſo well; and as to the
Doctours of <hi>Lovain,</hi> I know they will give a good
account of themſelves, and you will find them to
be both excellent and modeſt Men. I have writ to
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sazer,</hi> to make him ſenſible of
the good Office you have done him: God knows
how deſirous I am that all worthy Men, that do
ſervice, ſhould be conſidered for it; and of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted
intentions in ſuch caſes, I have Dr. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venda</hi>
for a witneſs, ſo that you may reſt ſatisfied,
that ſo often as there is occaſion, I ſhall not fail to
put His Majeſty in mind of the concerns of that
Archbiſhop: I have likewiſe writ <hi>Don Franciſco</hi> an
account of the Teſtimony you gave of his diligence
and managery. Our Lord preſerve you.</p>

               <p>I Have ſeen all that the Embaſſadours have writ to
His Majeſty, as alſo what you have writ at large,
and with great Wiſdom, in your Letters about the
ſame buſineſs; what you have offered, is well adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Terms we were on when you were here;
but the State of Affairs is much altered ſince that
time, for we have now no hopes of the Proteſtants
going to the Council, who having entered into a
Conſpiracy, do ſeek to gain the People to their
Devotion, by telling them that the Council goes
on, without giving them the hearing, and denies
them many things which it might lawfully grant;
by which means, things are thrown into ſuch a
terrible Confuſion, that the Catholicks, as well as
the Proteſtants, are for having the Council ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
among other things ſaying openly, that they
do not care to be judged by one Nation, and that,
though the Council ſhould be continued never ſo
long it would never make ſuch a Reformation as
is neceſſary, nor will have any other effect, but the
leſſening of the Authority of Councils; and that
in caſe His Majeſty ſhould do his Duty, in urging
to have ſuch a Reformation, he will undoubtedly
embroil himſelf thereby with the Pope: But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
there were no harm in that, ſo long as His
Majeſty does nothing but what is his Duty, and
convenient for the Service of God: The worſt of
all is, that no fruit can be expected, from any ſuch
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57465:170"/>
endeavours, ſince they will thereupon either tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate
or diſſolve the Council, as they ſhall think
moſt convenient, to the robbing of Councils of that
Authority, which is the only refuge, and remedy,
the Church has when diſturbed by Controverſies
about Religion; it being moſt certain, that the
<hi>Germans</hi> on the Terms they are on at preſent, will
not only not receive this Council, but they will
pretend that they are releaſed from the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Interim, which was to laſt only till the
definition of a Council, and will impugn this, and
that with too much colour among their own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who are not rightly informed of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church; for the Council to which the
Controverſie was remitted, not having adjuſted it,
there can be no agreement: And as it is certain,
that they will inſiſt on their Religion, ſo His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
will die ſooner than conſent to it. For which,
and ſeveral other Reaſons which have been weighed
by His Majeſty, he is come to a reſolution to write
to his Embaſſadours about it.</p>
               <p>As to what you write to me particularly, I have
communicated it three ſeveral times to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
who continues fixt, not to do any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
without the advice of his Embaſſadours, whom
he will have to ſend their opinions to him in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
which conſidering, that his Embaſſadours are
Men of Integrity, and will keep whatever is done
ſecret, he takes to be the beſt Courſe. This is
made ſtill the more difficult, by the preſent State
of things, in which, if the reſolution his Majeſty
has taken has its effect, there will be no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of entertaining any thoughts of that other
Courſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:57465:171"/>
It would do well therefore, that you ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
what you have to offer, as a thing I had writ
to you about, or ſpoke to you of when you were
here, and that you ſhould write likewiſe to His
Majeſty, deſiring that your Letter may be kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
and recommending Secrecy as to all things
that are done at <hi>Trent.</hi> In fine, now we are on
theſe Terms, you muſt not fail to employ all your
induſtry and diligence, that what His Majeſty is
compelled by the iniquity of the times to condeſcend
to, may be done, as much to his advantage as it is
poſſible.</p>

<hi>Vargas</hi> by ſight, and diſcourſe; and though I
had always reckoned him a very able Miniſter, yet
I do now find him to be a much greater Man than
I thought he was. I have been informed by him
of all the difficulties you have encountred with, as
well in the buſineſs of the ſafe Conduct for the
Proteſtants, as in the Propoſitions which have been
made: The Legate muſt not certainly have ſtudied
the Affairs of <hi>Germany</hi> much, nor the Books that
are wrote therein, that he is ſo much offended at
what they have ſaid in the Council: The ſaid Fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
carries His Majeſty's entire reſolution as to all
Affairs, which he knows very well how to report.
He has acquainted me with the pains you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
notwithſtanding your ſickneſs would not allow
you, to do what you would have done otherwiſe.
I was glad to hear him ſpeak ſo well of the Biſhop
<hi>Caſtellamar,</hi> of whom you know I had a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
before: That Prelate may reſt ſatisfied, that
whenever there is occaſion, I ſhall not forget to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
his Merits to His Majeſty; I pray God it
may be of advantage to him. Being deſirous to do
ſomething for the Study of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> I ordered a
Memorial to be given in about it ſome days ago,
in conformity of what the Procuratour <hi>Gualby</hi> had
writ to me concerning it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:57465:172"/>
Before we left <hi>Ausburg,</hi> I deſired His Majeſty
to give Dr. <hi>Gregory Lopez</hi> leave to go to a place
whither I would gladly have ſent him, but could
not obtain it, His Majeſty alledging, that the Court
having no other <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Phyſician, but him and
<hi>Olivares,</hi> could not poſſibly ſpare him; and much
leſs can it be expected now that His Majeſty
ſhould give way to his going to the Council, ſince
the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> has with great importunity
got <hi>Olivares</hi> to go with her.</p>
               <p>It is a wonderfull thing to me, that ſo many
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelates ſhould not have brought a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
with them; or that being ſo near to <hi>Italy,</hi> they
ſhould not all this while have ſent for ſome Eminent
Doctour, who I ſuppoſe might have made a good
buſineſs of it. I do aſſure you I have done in this
all that was poſſible for me, and I can do no more.
Our Lord preſerve you.</p>

               <p>I Find my ſelf two Letters in your debt, the laſt
of which came to me, ſince I arrived here;
where, if any thing can make me diſpenſe with the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57465:172"/>
Commodities of this place, it will be my being ſo
near <hi>Trent,</hi> that we can almoſt ſhake Hands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>I am infinitely glad, that the Seſſion was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
with ſo much Authority; but the thing that
troubles me, is, the reſolution they are come to
about the ways of proceeding, having left the old
known Methods, and which is worſt of all there is
no remedy for it; for though they know well
enough what would be moſt convenient, they will
never yield to it; ſo that without running a great
risk, we ſhall not be able to procure it: The buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Communion <hi>Sub utraque,</hi> might very
well have been remedied, without having made ſuch
a Noiſe about it, or without our having writ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it from hence, for we do not know what to
write, untill we have received advice of things
from you; and the Legate, if he had pleaſed, might
have remembred, that His Majeſty, when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
ſat formerly at <hi>Trent,</hi> writ that the matters that
are chiefly controverted, might not be handled till
a convenient time, and that his Holineſs writ like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to his Legates, to follow His Majeſty's dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
as to things of that Nature. For as you know
very well, Papers which muſt be read by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
before they are diſpatched, cannot be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as they might be otherwiſe; and ſo the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
to the Embaſſadour's Letters, though they
have been writ ſome days ago; yet by reaſon of His
Majeſty's not having as yet ſeen them, they cannot
go by this occaſion; but I ſhall take care to ſend
them as ſoon as it is poſſible.</p>
               <p>It would have had much more Authority, if the
Fathers had firſt delivered their Minds concerning
matters, and the decrees having been formed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
had been returned to them again to be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57465:173"/>
by them, than the taking the ſecond Courſe,
you inſtance in; but it being now too late to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
that, there is no mention of it in His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's
Letters. It would likewiſe, conſidering the
Neceſſities of the Times, have been moſt convenient
not to have had the Decrees publiſhed till the End
of the Council; but the contrary Cuſtom being
now introduced, by their having done otherwiſe in
the former Seſſions, it will be to no purpoſe to
urge what is propoſed by <hi>Cologne,</hi> notwithſtanding,
it was the Practiſe of all the Ancient Councils;
for we muſt be content to take things in the
State they are in, and make the beſt we can of
them.</p>
               <p>I was glad to hear from the Fiſcal <hi>Vargas,</hi> of
your having ſignalized your ſelf ſo much, by the
Oration you made: The Divine who would have
taken place of the Dean, might very well have excuſed
giving People occaſion to talk of him. <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco</hi>
has writ concerning it, and has excepted you
by Name: His Majeſty nor none elſe having ever
imagined, that ſuch a pretence could have been
ſtarted by any body; it being moſt certain that
they are all His Majeſty's Embaſſadours, as well
thoſe of <hi>Flanders,</hi> as thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> being all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Servants of the ſame Maſter, and ſent on the
ſame Errand.</p>
               <p>I am not unmindfull of your particular buſineſs,
having ſpoke ſeveral times, both to <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> and
Secretary <hi>Vargas</hi> about it; ſo that if you have
not had a return, you will have one by the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity;
I have told them often, that if thoſe
returns were made by the ordinary ways, His
Majeſty, whoſe ceremonies, and opinions, you are
no ſtranger to, would be beſt pleaſed with
them.</p>

I cannot forbear ſhewing great reſpect to Dr. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſco,</hi>
as well upon his own Account, as upon your
Commendation of him. I have received the Book
of the Decrees which have been paſſed in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
for which I kiſs your Hands; thoſe of the laſt
Seſſion were ſent me by <hi>Don Franciſco,</hi> of which to
ſpeak the truth, I have the ſame opinion that you
have, it being impoſſible, as they precipitate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to have them diſcuſſed in ſo ſhort a time, as
they ought to be. If there were any perſwading of
them, to take the moſt convenient Courſes, there
are ſeveral Articles ought to be deferred till the
Proteſtants come: We ſhall ſee, whether, what His
Majeſty writes concerning ſuch matters will be able
to remedy things a little for the future.</p>
               <p>The ſafe Conduct is very defective to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes

keeping them there. Our Lord preſerve you.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Have received two Letters from your Lordſhip,
the firſt whereof is full of Complaints, upon
what His Majeſty had writ to your Lordſhip, and
the ſecond is a retractation, of the ſuſpicion you
had of the Embaſſadour.</p>
               <p>Now as there is nothing that troubles your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
that does not give me pain, ſo I do aſſure you,
His Majeſty's Letter to you gave me a great deal;
I do not ſay this to excuſe my ſelf, who being
His Majeſty's Miniſter am bound to obey him, and
eſpecially when after having endeavoured to ſatisfie
him, he commands me abſolutely to do it; after
which I did not think fit to make any farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
knowing certainly that if I had done it, I ſhould
have made the buſineſs worſe, His Majeſty being in
ſo great a paſſion at that time, that a reply would
have ſerved only to have increaſed his Choler.</p>
               <p>The original of all this, was, His Majeſty's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been informed, that there were three of the
Prelates abſent from <hi>Trent</hi> at once, the Biſhop of
<hi>Segovia</hi> having abſented himſelf without leave, and
the Biſhop of <hi>Placentia</hi> being gone to <hi>Venice</hi> only
for Paſtime.</p>
               <p>Now His Majeſty being zealous in all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of Religion, and being extreamly deſirous of
reaping ſome fruit of this Council, which, though
it may not be ſo much as is neceſſary, yet that it
may be as much as can be had; and that on his
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57465:174"/>
part, and theirs who are employed by him, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhould be wanting that is neceſſary towards
the procuring of a Reformation; he commanded
thoſe Letters to be writ, by the diſpatch that went
to the Embaſſadour, who I do aſſure your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
never writ one word concerning that Affair to
His Majeſty, neither am I able to tell, by what
way he was informed of it, there being a great
many People, who ſpeak to him of things upon
ſuch ſlight Grounds, that one would wonder they
are not aſhamed to do it.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip's Letter being come to hand, I
took care to communicate ſo much of it as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to His Majeſty, ſaying ſeveral things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
of which your Servant can give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>The Lady <hi>Dona Maria de Lara</hi> had ſpoke to me
about it, as ſhe has likewiſe very well, as ſhe can do in
all things, to His Majeſty, neither was Secretary
<hi>Vargas</hi> wanting in doing your Lordſhip good Offices
therein, ſo that His Majeſty is now ſatisfied, who ſaid,
the foundation of his anger having been the Prelates
going from <hi>Trent,</hi> without his Embaſſadour's leave,
ſince you were not concerned in that, he had nothing
more to ſay; only, that he will not have you, nor
none of the Prelates that are at <hi>Trent</hi> on his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
to abſent themſelves from ſo good a Work
for one Moment.</p>
               <p>It amazeth me that the Embaſſadour, who is ſo
civil and well bred a Perſon in all things, ſhould be
rude to you and the reſt of the Prelates; I can only
ſay, that upon my own account, I cannot allow, a
certain careleſsneſs in Behaviour to be reckoned a
great fault in Men of buſineſs; I my ſelf when my
head is full of buſineſs, being apt to commit ſuch
Errours; and when he chooſes to go on foot for
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57465:175"/>
exerciſe, or ſome other conveniency, the Biſhops if
they pleaſe may eaſily rid themſelves of ſuch of his
Servants, as have the impudence to go where they
ought not.</p>
               <p>As to buſineſs, it is certain your Lordſhip han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
it, with a neceſſary Zeal, and an earneſt deſire
of doing God and His Majeſty Service, for which
you cannot have a better Rule, than to follow what
the Embaſſadours ſhall tell you is His Majeſty's
Will, who have inſtructions from hence as to all
points: At preſent I have nothing more to add,
only to tell you, that your Lordſhip hereafter will
not have any Cauſe given you to complain; and
that in me you will always find a moſt affectionate
Servant, and whom you may freely command as
ſuch. With this I end, beſeeching our Lord to
preſerve your moſt Reverend Lordſhip.</p>

the cuſtomary Favour, of being acquainted
with your being in health, of which now we are ſo
near, I hope I ſhall hear frequently to my great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
As I am ambitious to ſerve His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
in any thing, ſo I am chiefly in matters relating
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57465:175"/>
to the Council, about which, God is my witneſs,
I do all that I am able; and as I rejoyce extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at any thing that is right being done therein, ſo
I am extreamly troubled, when I ſee things done
there on purpoſe to obſtruct the Reformation of
God's holy Religion.</p>
               <p>I do all I am able to bring them to be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the <hi>Germans,</hi> that, as your Lordſhip in
your great prudence knows very well, being a thing
of great moment, and about which I have taken
more pains, than can be imagined. So that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
I ſee things done every day, that do
no ways pleaſe me, I comfort my ſelf with the
thoughts of my having done all that I was able, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been wanting neither for will, nor pains.</p>
               <p>We aim all at the ſame mark, which is to have
things remedied as is neceſſary, to which Work
there are great obſtacles, of which, though we are
very ſenſible, we are forced for fear of bringing all
to ruine, to diſſemble our knowledge of them: I
have ſeen your Lordſhip's Memorial, and <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco</hi>'s
alſo, which he ſent to His Majeſty upon the
informations he had received from the Prelates.</p>
               <p>It is not His Majeſty's intention, that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
ſhould loſe any thing they are in poſſeſſion of,
that is not offenſive, or to the prejudice of the
Church of God, neither do I believe it is <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco</hi>'s;
but ſo it is, that there are many things to be
wiſhed, and it would be happy if they were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which if his Holineſs were preſſed to do, would
make a breach, that would be attended with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inconveniencies, than any thing that is done;
it is therefore neceſſary, that all ſuch matters be
very tenderly handled, ſince to ſpeak to have all the
Exactions and Abuſes of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
does certainly knock that and all other buſineſs,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57465:176"/>
on the head at once. We muſt therefore ſeek, and
that obliquely too, to get ſome things removed, which
give great offence, and are of advantage only to
ſome particular Perſons, but are prejudicial to the
publick, even of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf; for ſhould we do any
thing otherwiſe than thus, that is contrary to the
Guſto of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they will immediately upon it,
put a ſtop to all buſineſs; I cannot at preſent enter
upon particulars, but ſhall only tell you, that we
have had ſeveral Conferences upon what <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco</hi>

               <p>BEfore I went to <hi>Mantua,</hi> to kiſs the moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
King, and Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi>'s Hands, I
writ to your moſt Reverend Lordſhip for leave to
go, which I deſired likewiſe of the Legate, and the
Embaſſadour <hi>Don Franciſco de Toledo:</hi> To whom I
declared, that unleſs he would give me leave in His
Majeſty's Name, that I would not ſtir out of the
Gates of <hi>Trent;</hi> who thereupon granted me leave
before ſeveral Prelates, and other Perſons, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me for going to kiſs their Highneſs's hands, to
whom, beſides their being His Majeſty's Children,
I owed ſo much Service: So that, had I been going
to ſerve the King of <hi>France,</hi> I could not have made
more Complements, nor have begg'd leave more
earneſtly. I returned to <hi>Trent</hi> again in Eight days,
and having accompanied their Highneſſes to <hi>Bolſon,</hi>
was commanded by the King to officiate to him at
<hi>Chriſtmaſs,</hi> which I did, and returned to <hi>Trent</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
before New-years-day, to the firſt Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Neither was I ever abſent from ſo much as
one Congregation, from the time the Council
made me a Deputy; at which I have ſeveral times
aſſiſted Eight hours together to ſerve God, and His
Majeſty; in recompence for all which trouble, and
for having ſerved their Highneſſes, I have an angry
Letter ſent me by His Majeſty, on Account of that
abſence, blaming me equally with the reſt of the
Prelates, that have been abſent: Who ever he was
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57465:178"/>
that gave this information to His Majeſty, muſt
have had a ſtrong inclination for to have me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
having forgot to tell, that he gave me
leave, and that I went to ſerve His Majeſty's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and that I have never once been abſent.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I know very well, from whence all
this comes, and that it can be from none but the
Embaſſadour, who is jealous of my having adviſed
His Majeſty of what has been done here about
Benefices, and ſome other things; notwithſtanding,
I never wrote any thing to his prejudice, neither
indeed could I do it. I am nevertheleſs ſenſible,
that let me do never ſo much Service, His Majeſty
ſhall never hear of it; whereas, if I ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any fault, I muſt never be pardoned for it; all
this I ſuffer in prudence, which, without it, I
ſhould not be able to endure.</p>
               <p>I have ſupplicated His Majeſty to order your
moſt Reverend Lordſhip, to command an informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be taken, whether I did not publickly ask
leave of the Embaſſadour, to kiſs the King, and
Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi>'s Hands, and whether he did not
grant it me, and whether I have taken any pains
here, or done any ſervice, or whether I have been
ſo much as once faulty, of which when His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
ſhall come to be informed, he will be ſenſible,
how ill a thing he did, who ſaid, I have nothing
elſe to write, but that three of the Prelates are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
without telling how, or for what, and that
on purpoſe to make His Majeſty angry with me.
Beſides, I being ſo much your moſt Reverend
Lordſhip's Servant, have cauſe to complain of your
Lordſhip likewiſe, for your having conſented to my
having been thus affronted in the middle of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
and that to me who deſerved favours and thanks,
an angry Letter from His Majeſty ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57465:179"/>
inſtead of them, for it would have been juſt
to have known firſt what I had to ſay for my ſelf.</p>
               <p>I muſt deſire your moſt Reverend Lordſhip, to
acquaint His Majeſty with my being certain, that
<hi>Don Franciſco de Toledo</hi> is none of my friend, though
for no other reaſon that I can think of; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he cannot endure, that any Perſon beſides
himſelf, ſhould adviſe His Majeſty of any thing.</p>
               <p>I ſhall likewiſe eſteem it a great Favour, if your
moſt Reverend Lordſhip would let me know how I
muſt behave my ſelf, in the way we are treated by
the Embaſſadour; who, whenever he pleaſeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to go to his Houſe, and to accompany
him thither on foot. On which occaſions he walks
before, and the Prelates follow him in the Croud of
his Pages and Servants, and as it does not look very
well to ſee a Company of Ancient Prelates, as it
were dragged along by his Livery-men, ſo it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
likewiſe in ſeeming to leſſen the Liberty
and Authority of the Prelates; not but that if I
were ſure it were for His Majeſty's Service, I would
be ready to do it upon my Knees, but if it is not, I
deſire your moſt Reverend Lordſhip to let me know
ſo much. Our Lord preſerve your moſt Illuſtrious
Lordſhip's moſt Reverend Perſon, and increaſe your

Conſtat quoque ex Eccleſiae antiquitate, jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta

electione cleri, &amp; aſſenſu populi, &amp; finitimorum
