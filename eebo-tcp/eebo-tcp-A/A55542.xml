            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>AS this triffle of a Comedy, was only a slight piece of Scribble,
purely design'd for the Introduction of a little Musick, being
no more than a short weeks work, to serve the wants of a
thin Playhouse, and Long Vacation; under those little cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
it needs no Apology for either the Plot or the Writing part
of it: It neither sets up for a Play, nor the Author for a Poet: Such
as it is, it has served a present Exigence, and so gain'd the Point. I
have no Appeal therefore to the Mercy either of the Auditors, or
the Reader. 'Tis true, I thrust it into the World; for 'tis the fashion
to be in Print. A Play that sees not three Days, however shall meet
with some kind Bookseller, that in spight of the Paper Tax, shall
take the naked thing into Mercy, and this hasty Brat is however a
little longer liv'd, had the Honour of keeping the Stage for five
Days Reign, and is not yet under the Fear of Abdication.</p>
            <p>Yet as indifferent as I am to the merit of the Comedy (and my
Reader I suppose as indifferent) it has one Capital Argument lyes
against it; for I stand impeacht (at least the Publick Cry is loud
upon that Subject) that I have stolen a Character from a Comedy
of Mrs. P—t'<hi>s,</hi> being the Humour of <hi>Bondi</hi> the pretended blind
Man.—I would not willingly be thought so poor a Plagiary, and
am far from being guilty of this accusation. For, in the first place, I
had that hint from a Novel, and that Play of her's that has such a
Character I declare I never Read. 'Tis true, such a one she brought
into the House, and made me a Solicitor to the Company to get it
Acted, which when I had obtain'd, she very mannerly carry'd the
Play to the other House; and had I really taken the Character from
her, I had done her no more than a piece of Justice.</p>

Health, but he that is Defective shall be incapable of bearing that

               <p>Defective, O that I had been born without a Leg or an Arm, what
a deal of Money might I have saved: But hold, I have it, I will be
Blind, 4000l. a Year is worth any Man's shutting his Eyes for.</p>
               <p>But then, if I shou'd chance to be discover'd, my Estates forfeited,

I'll be hang'd first, tho I get by the Government, I'll take care the

from my approaching Bliss: Lovers you know are restless, froward
Creatures, when expectation burns 'em; O! the transports this happy
night will yield me! ha, what's this, a sudden damp strook cold upon
my heart: What need I fear, the Demon has no power over me yet,
my time's not yet expir'd, or if it were, Repentance may prolong it.</p>

               <p>I'll warrant you, Sir, if there be any Pimping in the Case, let

               <p>So, now am I pretty well stock'd for to morrow, but how
the Devil shall I dispose of my self, 'tis too soon to go home, and
besides, I shall never Sleep well, if I go to Bed sober: Let me see,
I have not done a Pious Charitable act this great while, I will begin
just now, and go visit this blind Puppy that has lapt up my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
if I should chance to find him making his Will, who knows but
—Lamentable Condition, it may peirce like a Spear through
the tough hide of his Conscience, and make him leave me something to
drink to his good Passage: But for fear the dismal Object should
make me Melancholly, I will Sing all the way, to keep my self in good
Humour.</p>

               <p>Look ye Seignior, I am very well satisfied, that his Grace
does believe you can't see, but then again he has nothing but
your bare word for't: I that have made the business of the Eyes my
study, have obtained a Commission from the Duke, to make an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
upon you, and by that means satisfie him whether you can see
or no.</p>

               <speaker>Bond.</speaker>
               <p>See or no, why, does his Grace imagine I take a Pleasure in

               <speaker>Ped.</speaker>
               <p>That you best know, but in the mean time I must follow my

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bond.</speaker>
               <p>Why what do you intend to do with me?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ped.</speaker>
               <p>I am order'd to take out both Eyes, and dessect'em, if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
see they'l be no loss to you, if you can, you deserve to be so serv'd
for offering to trick the Duke and State.</p>

as if I envied 'em their vast delight, what can this mean, my Soul
is on the Rack, and yet I cannot give a reason for it. Where are
those mighty pleasures I propos'd in the Embraces of the Charming

that fatal Contract ruins soul and body; what have I done, why, why
did I marry, why have I made the Innocent <hi>Mercella</hi> a wretched part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

I'll be a very humble Wife, or if you think I marry not for Love

at a Rate so high, that the whole World weighs not a Grain of the vast

which my Father dy'd, his Confessor, Physition of his Soul come
to me, and delivered me a Paper, which I have wore ever since next
my heart: My Son, said he, take this, and when thou find'st thou art
upon the very brink of ruin, open that Paper and thou'lt find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd
that which will make thy Enemies fly from thee: now is the
time, I'm just upon the Brink, and here before me stands my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
