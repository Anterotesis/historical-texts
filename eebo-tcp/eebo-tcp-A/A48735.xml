            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath been a constant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint almost ever since the World began, and that which hath prov'd a trouble not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Vulgar Spirits, but hath given some temptation even to the Wise and the Good also; that whereas Justice requires, <hi>ut Bonis sit benè, Malis malè,</hi> that it should go <hi>Well</hi> with the <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Ill</hi> with the <hi>Bad;</hi> God sometimes, by his providential Dispensations, if not orders, at least suffers it to be quite otherwise: insomuch that <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and his Followers, upon this account ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denied, that there was any such thing as Divine <hi>Providence,</hi> to take care of things here below: which yet, from the very principles of Vertue and common Morality, the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> another sort of Philosophers, as stoutly


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61393:5"/>
asserted and maintain'd, notwithstanding this seeming Irregularity in its unequal distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which confideration is still further im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by <hi>Christian</hi> Philosophy into a ground of Belief of one of the main <hi>Articles</hi> of our Religion, <hi>to wit,</hi> a future State; and has been made use of as one great Argument and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, beside that of <hi>Revelation,</hi> to confirm our Faith of the last Judgment, of a Life after this, and of eternal Rewards.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Psalm</hi> up and down represents the <hi>Case,</hi> to wit, the flourishing condition of the Wicked to the great prejudice and hazard of Gods people; and supposing this might prove a Temptation to the Godly, to entertain such unquiet apprehensions, as <hi>David</hi> himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges elsewhere he had laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, till he went into the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> that is, till <note place="margin">Ps. 73. 17.</note> he had consulted with the Divine Oracles, and thence received satisfaction and ease; he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades us, in such Instances, to confidence in God and patience in well-doing; and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the Estate of Pious and Ungodly men to be as different, not only in the World to come, but through Gods just Judgment ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times even in this Life, as their Principles and Practices have been.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61393:5"/>
These are the most considerable Subjects and Parts of this whole Composure; of which, because they lie scattered here and there, and intermixt with one another, (a thing usual in <hi>Alphabetical</hi> Writings, such as this is;) I shall not go about to present you with an exact <hi>Analysis,</hi> but fetch in the Royal Prophets sentiments and observations, as they will fall in kindly into the body of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, as we go along.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Words, I have now read to you, are a compleat Abridgment of the whole <hi>Psalm,</hi> or rather a general <hi>Aphorism</hi> applied here to this particular Case, by which It, as all others of like nature, ought to be stated and resolv'd. For if we are in the general account of Piety, upon all occasions of <hi>Danger</hi> or <hi>Distress,</hi> of <hi>Doubt</hi> or seeming <hi>Desertion,</hi> to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our way unto the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to trust in him;</hi> then it will behove us no less, in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Case of prosperous Wickedness and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Piety, to have the same deference to God and confidence in him: and God, who is never wanting to those who trust in him, will also, in this Case, upon our meek submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to his <hi>Will,</hi> and faithful adherence to his <hi>Word,</hi> support and relieve us, at least do that


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61393:6"/>
which shall be best for us; he will, in his due time, according to his good pleasure, if we <hi>commit</hi> our selves and our ways to him, and <hi>trust</hi> in him, <hi>he will bring it to pass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are then in this piece of Scripture <hi>three</hi> things to be taken notice of; the <hi>one</hi> Implied or supposed, the other <hi>two</hi> Expressed and plainly set down.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is the supposal of a <hi>Case,</hi> of a doubtful and dangerous condition; for so the <hi>committing</hi> of a Concern to another, and trusting his Wisdom and Fidelity with the management of it, implies, that a man doth not think himself safe without such a devolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confidence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>Direction,</hi> how we are to behave our selves in a case of such doubt and danger; <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. An <hi>Assurance</hi> of good success upon our so doing: <hi>and he will bring it to pass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of these Severals I shall treat with all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest plainness, the Thing it self being of an universal use and influence, wherein all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, all Interests are concerned; that I may take in all, even the meanest capacities.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61393:6"/>
I. For the <hi>Case</hi> supposed; it is but so in the <hi>Text,</hi> but in the <hi>Psalm</hi> it self it is sufficiently expressed and fully represented.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Psalm,</hi> to give a short account of it, is a perswasive to Contentment and Satisfaction with <hi>Providence,</hi> which permits wicked men to flourish for a while; inforced with sundry <hi>Reasons,</hi> especially this, That Godly mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is however much better than theirs, even at the present, not to speak of hereafter. So it begins,</p>
            <p>Verse 1. <hi>Fret not thy self because of Evil doers, neither be thou envious against the workers of Iniquity.</hi> He means, we should not fret or repine to see them in such a prosperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: for so 'tis expresly said <hi>vers.</hi> 2. <hi>Fret not thy self because of him who prospereth in his way; because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</hi> Be not troubled at the prosperity of wicked men and their strange successfulness, if it should so be, and as it often happens.</p>
            <p>And so he brings it in as an Observe of his own towards the later end, <hi>vers.</hi> 35. <hi>I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green Bay-tree; yet he passed away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed were this all, that Wicked men


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61393:7"/>
only grew great, acquired power and wealth, and did no hurt with it to others; this might well enough be born with, we should not need to fret our selves at them, or to envy them upon this score: but when they abuse those Advantages to the danger of the Church and the destruction of Gods Servants, this must needs affect, and go near to the heart of all those who are toucht with any care of Gods honour and the concerns of Religion. And thus is it here,</p>
            <p>Verse 12. <hi>The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.</hi> They lay designs of Treachery and Mischief, as having a natural Antipathy against those persons, who out of Conscience dare not believe as they believe, nor do as they do; as the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the second Chapter of his <hi>Wisdom</hi> has elegantly set it forth. <hi>Come,</hi> say they, <hi>let us lie in wait for the Righteous; because he is not for our turn; and he is clean contrary to our doings. He upbraideth us with our offending the Law, and objecteth to our infamy the transgressions of our Education. He professeth to have the knowledge of God; and he calleth himself the Child of the Lord. He was made to reprove our thoughts. He is grievous unto us, even to behold; for his life is</hi>


               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61393:7"/>
               <hi>not like other mens, his ways are of another fashion. We are esteemed of him as Counterfeits; he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staineth from our ways as from filthiness,</hi> &amp;c. What words could more graphically express that devilish Animosity, which those of <hi>Rome</hi> have against the <hi>English</hi> and other Reformed Churches?</p>
            <p>Well! from Consult they proceed to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Verse 14. <hi>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of a right conversation.</hi> They make their bloody preparations to ruin those who lived quietly by them, and trusting to their strength and policy, are forward to venture upon any thing, be it never so unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that may advantage their Cause, against those who refolve not to use any unlawful means, though for their own Preservation.</p>
            <p>And if they cannot do it by Whole-sale, in Massacres; they are content by Retail to vent their cruel malice upon single persons.</p>
            <p>Verse 32. <hi>The wicked watcheth the Righteous;</hi> he dogs him up and down; <hi>and seeketh occasion to slay him;</hi> that is, he uses all arts and attempts of Treachery to insnare and trepan him.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Case,</hi> as it is here put.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61393:8"/>
And that this hath been the condition of the <hi>Church</hi> and People of God, throughout all Ages, ever since there was an Enmity put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Seed of the <hi>Woman,</hi> that is, Christ and all true Believers; and the Seed of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> that is, Wicked men, who act under the Devil as his Instruments; is so apparent from all <hi>Church-History,</hi> that I need not trouble you with a collection. St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his Book of the <hi>City of God</hi> hath, as I remember, given a fair account of this matter at large. Thus <hi>Cain</hi> slew <hi>Abel</hi> upon the score of Religion, because his Brothers offering was accepted, and his own was not: <hi>Ishmael</hi> the Son of the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, persecuted <hi>Isaac</hi> the Child of the Promise; and <hi>Esau</hi> hated <hi>Jacob</hi> and vow'd his death, because he was better beloved of God and had got the Blessing from him.</p>
            <p>And for this reason the <hi>Israelites,</hi> Gods select People, were detested by all the Heathen and Idolatrous Nations, that dwelt round about them; because they had a different way of Worship from them all, wherewith they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped the true God according to his own Appointment. And yet it pleased God at


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61393:8"/>
several times to give up this People of his for their sins into the hands of their Enemies, the <hi>Moabites, Ammonites, Syrians, Babylonians;</hi> and upon their Repentance to work for them great and signal Deliverances.</p>
            <p>And thus, to go no further with the dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, hath stood the Case betwixt us and our <hi>Popish</hi> Adversaries ever since the Reformation.<hi>—Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, may</hi> our <hi>Israel now say. Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, yet they have not prevailed against me,</hi> Psal. 129. 1, 2. They have by Gods providence and our own indulgence been suffered to live amongst us in better condition, than perhaps other Subjects have; free from those <hi>Penalties</hi> the Law had imposed upon them, and quit of those charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Duties,</hi> that lie upon others; and by this means have had the opportunity of amassing great Wealth, and carrying on the <hi>Catholick-Cause,</hi> as they call it; till at last they were grown ripe, as they fancied, by the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of their Priests and a kind of universal Combination of the whole Party at home and abroad, for the Execution of their great Design, which God in his Mercy <hi>hath</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, or I hope <hi>will</hi> prevent; nay certainly


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61393:9"/>
will, if we, as we ought to do, <hi>commit</hi> our selves and our ways unto him.</p>
            <p>My business is not to blow the Coals, or to raise those popular Jealousies, which are too apt of themselves, upon occasion, especially if they meet with any incouragement, to break out into open flames; but rather to allay those irregular heats. Only I could not but take notice of a matter of fact, which is so notorious; and I must avow, (for why may I not? it being the sense of the Nation:) that there's no one, who has any Piety to <hi>God,</hi> any Loyalty to his <hi>Sovereign,</hi> in whose Sacred life all our Interests are involved; any Love to his <hi>Country,</hi> or any true care of <hi>himself:</hi> I say, there is no good <hi>Protestant</hi> or true <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> but must needs as verily believe the late damnable Conspiracy of the <hi>Papists</hi> against us, as he does heartily detest it; and be truly sensible of the danger we were in, and of Gods Mercy in the Discovery of it.</p>
            <p>This then being a <hi>Case</hi> not only supposed, but publickly declared; the next thing, which is to be the main of my Meditations, is to shew, how we are to behave our selves, when we are thus beset with Enemies, that profess a <hi>Religion,</hi> whose <hi>Principles</hi> are made up of


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61393:9"/>
Superstition and Tyranny, and whose <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices</hi> have been always as full of Treachery and Cruelty. For that is the true Scope and Purport of this both <hi>Psalm</hi> and <hi>Text,</hi> to advise in what manner the People of God ought to demean themselves under such perillous and afflictive Circumstances. This is the second part.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Direction</hi> or Counsel the <hi>Psalmist</hi> gives upon the <hi>Case,</hi> which seems to be two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, as being delivered in two Forms of words; but is indeed much at one: for so <hi>rolling our selves</hi> or <hi>our way upon the Lord,</hi> is in the language of the <hi>Psalms</hi> the same thing as <hi>trusting</hi> in him. However for Distribution sake, I shall consider those Expressions sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately and apart. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For <hi>committing our way unto the Lord,</hi>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61393:10"/>
An intire <hi>Obedience</hi> to the <hi>Word</hi> of God, as the Rule of our actions.</p>
            <p>A meek <hi>Submission</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> of God, which governs human Affairs. And</p>
            <p>A <hi>regular Walking</hi> in the <hi>Duties</hi> of our <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling;</hi> leaving the rest, as things which we are not immediately concerned in, to God Almighty's disposal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Trusting in God</hi> imports these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars: <note place="margin">2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A fiducial <hi>Reliance</hi> upon his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> in the care and conduct of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and of all our Concerns.</p>
            <p>A Declaration of that our dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him in earnest and frequent <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And withal honest <hi>Endeavours</hi> of our own for our <hi>Preservation,</hi> in the use of all lawful Means; holding our selves still in that Station wherein God hath placed us, and leaving the Event to him.</p>
            <p>That these <hi>Interpretations</hi> are proper and natural, I shall, as I go, briefly make out from the body of the <hi>Psalm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Commit thy way unto the Lord</hi> is a Rule, as I said before, of general use, to quiet the minds of men, and to secure them either from


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61393:10"/>
their <hi>Fears</hi> or under their <hi>Troubles,</hi> whatever they may be, <hi>Temporal</hi> or <hi>Spiritual, Personal</hi> or <hi>National;</hi> particularly, as it is here limited, to fortifie and bear up the Spirits of pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against the apprehension or actual op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of <hi>prosperous Wickedness.</hi> And that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they do carefully <hi>obey</hi> God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his <hi>Word,</hi> which he hath appointed for the Rule of our actions; by doing what he hath there commanded, and by avoiding all known sin: and this will certainly draw after it the divine <hi>Protection</hi> and all manner of Blessings.</p>
            <p>So <hi>vers.</hi> 27. <hi>Depart from evil and do good, and dwell for evermore.</hi> This is the best course, any man can take, either for this World or the next; whereas <hi>Evil doers,</hi> on the one hand or the other, be they of what profession or deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination they will, we are told <hi>vers.</hi> 9. <hi>shall be cut off</hi> and <hi>rooted out</hi> by some signal Vengeance, or untimely Excision.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>Delight thy self in the Lord;</hi> let it be thy great delight and satisfaction, and thy main design, to serve and to please him; <hi>and he will give thee thy hearts desire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus <hi>vers.</hi> 30. in a fuller account. <hi>The mouth of the righteous speaketh Wisdom, and</hi>


               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61393:11"/>
               <hi>his tongue talketh of Judgment. The Law of his God is in his heart:</hi> all his thoughts and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses are busied about Gods Word, and his own Duty; and this indeed is true saving <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and of him it is there said, that <hi>none of his goings shall slide;</hi> he stands upon sure ground.</p>
            <p>And this we find laid down for a Maxim in the <hi>38th</hi> verse, according to our reading in the <hi>Church-Office;</hi> and that agreeably to some ancient Translations: <hi>Keep innocence, and take heed to the thing that is right; for that shall bring a man Peace at the last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the contrary for a man, by a designed deliberate Disobedience, to go out of Gods way, is to put himself out of his Protection; and he that would save his <hi>Soul,</hi> his <hi>Life,</hi> his <hi>Fortunes,</hi> or whatever it be, by doing against Gods Commands will find, that he takes the readiest course to lose them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they meekly <hi>submit</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> of God, in his Providential Administrations. As there is a <hi>will</hi> of his <hi>Commands,</hi> so there's a <hi>will</hi> of his <hi>Decrees.</hi> To <hi>that</hi> we are bound to pay an <hi>active</hi> Obedience, to <hi>this</hi> a <hi>passive.</hi> By <hi>this</hi> He governs the World, by <hi>that</hi> We ought to govern our selves. <hi>That</hi> Will of his is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61393:11"/>
in <hi>Scripture; this</hi> laid forth in <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know, there were a sort of people, that made great use of <hi>Providence,</hi> and governed themselves by it; making <hi>Scripture</hi> it self sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to it, and concluding any thing, were it never so bad, lawful, if it were but success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But this was no fair use of <hi>Providence,</hi> nor was it a right method to expound <hi>Scriptures</hi> according to <hi>Providences,</hi> as they were wont to do; but on the contrary to interpret <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> by <hi>Scripture.</hi> For God many times by his <hi>Providence</hi> permits those Evils to have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the doing of which he hath in his <hi>Word</hi> forbidden. As then the <hi>Evil of Sin</hi> cannot be justified by Providence, so the <hi>Evil of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which Providence at any time brings upon us, is to be submitted to; which the Prophet calls the <hi>accepting of our Punishment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where this meek <hi>Submission</hi> is, there will be no <hi>Fretting,</hi> no Repining or Murmuring, but a patient Attendance. This we meet with in the front of the Psalm; <hi>Fret not thy self,</hi> do not vex and chase and <hi>heat thy self,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Original:</hi> and it is further explain'd <hi>vers.</hi> 7. <hi>Rest in the Lord,</hi> or <hi>Be silent to the Lord,</hi> make no complaints, <hi>and wait patiently for him; do not fret</hi> or <hi>grieve at the man that doth after evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels:</hi>


               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61393:12"/>
as if he should have said; Have patience a while, and thou'lt have reason to admire and applaud Gods Wisdom and Justice, and his Mercy too in those worst of his Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, which now thou art too apt to be troubled at.</p>
            <p>It was good advice <hi>Gamaliel</hi> gave, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 39. and it took; that if a <hi>Counsel or a Work be of God,</hi> it cannot be overthrown; and to oppose it is <hi>to fight against God;</hi> which who do, they make to themselves a great Enemy and are like to have but little peace. <hi>But the Meek,</hi> as it is <hi>vers.</hi> 11. <hi>shall inherit the Earth, and shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light themselves in abundance of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That they <hi>keep</hi> orderly <hi>to the duties of their</hi> own <hi>Station,</hi> and leave other things out of their Sphere to God and to their Superiours, to take care of.</p>
            <p>And this is a Consequent of that <hi>Meekness,</hi> we spoke of <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>Cease from anger, forsake wrath;</hi> do not be troubled, or discontented: <hi>fret not thy self in any wise to do evil,</hi> or, as we read, <hi>fret not thy self, else shalt thou be moved to do evil;</hi> do not be transported with Passion, so as to go out of the Road of thy Duty, and to venture upon things that do not concern thee, that no way belong to thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:61393:12"/>
And it is also an Evidence of <hi>Trusting in God,</hi> as it is <hi>vers.</hi> 3. <hi>Trust in the Lord and be doing good;</hi> thy best and wisest course will be to hold thee to God, and to order thy self according to his will, by doing all the good thou canst in that place, wherein he has set thee, and whatever the Temptation may be, do not fall off to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil irregular courses; <hi>and so shalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou shalt be fed:</hi> God will then provide for thy security and thy comfortable subsistence.</p>
            <p>And this he lays down in a Proposition, <hi>vers.</hi> 23. <hi>The steps of a man are ordered by the Lord, and he delighteth in his way;</hi> that is, If his steps be so ordered, that his Conversation be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Gods Will and Direction, then God will delight in his way; he will be pleased and kindly accept of him.</p>
            <p>However <hi>be not</hi> so <hi>envious against the workers of Iniquity,</hi> as to emulate them, to be tempted to do like them, to take the same course as they do, or to joyn with them, because thou seest them prosper, and to commit Wickedness and to do evil also, as the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast has render'd that place.</p>
            <p>There are some who out of a tenderness of apprehension imagine, they cannot be safe


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61393:13"/>
from <hi>Popery,</hi> without running into the other extreme of <hi>Schism,</hi> (which is, as the Apostle sets it, <hi>to abhor Idols and commit Sacriledge)</hi> and yet are ready enough to take up the same Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as <hi>Papists</hi> have, and to do the same things as <hi>Papists</hi> do.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> call us <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and upon that score think they can design or act nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, but what the cause of <hi>Religion</hi> and the advantage of <hi>holy Church</hi> will make good. Let not us be so far <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as to do like them, and to justifie their <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> by owning them our selves. <hi>Ye know not,</hi> says Christ, <hi>of what spirit ye are,</hi> when his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples would have had him called for fire from Heaven. It is no <hi>Christian</hi> Spirit, no <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> temper, this.</p>
            <p>It is however a known Rule and generally approv'd in mens Practice, <hi>Vim Vi;</hi> to repel <hi>force</hi> by force, and to supplant <hi>fraud</hi> with fraud; but <hi>Christianity</hi> sure will not allow of this, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us that <hi>Vengeance</hi> is Gods Prerogative, and that the best way of Revenge is <hi>to overcome Evil with Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So much for the <hi>first</hi> part of the <hi>Advice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61393:13"/>
II. The <hi>other</hi> part of this Head is to <hi>trust in God;</hi> to depend upon him, to make our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to him, and what we may lawfully do of ourselves towards our own safety, not to be over-sollicitous about it, but to leave the event of it to him, who will never forsake them or leave them destitute, that thus trust in him. And this implies</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>fiducial Relyance</hi> upon his Wisdom and Goodness; which is that St. <hi>Peter</hi> advises; <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting all your care upon him, for he careth for you.</hi> And whom can we better trust than God, in all our Affairs, in all our Concerns? for <hi>if he be for us, who can be against us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed that is one main design of Gods, in letting the Churches Enemies prevail over her at any time, in suffering his People to fall sometimes into danger or distress, besides our <hi>Amendment</hi> and <hi>Trial,</hi> to drive us to a closer <hi>Dependance</hi> upon himself, and to unhinge us from all secular Confidences.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Relyance</hi> includes in it all the three Christian <hi>Graces;</hi> an Adhesion of <hi>Faith,</hi> an Assurance of <hi>Hope,</hi> and an intire Resignation of Mind and Fortunes, which is the Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Charity.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Jonas</hi> owned, when he was in the belly of the Whale, with weeds wrapt about his head; whose discharge was immediately ordered by God upon his Prayer; and for a Document to us all, he tells us there, that <hi>They who observe lying vanities,</hi> those who take ill courses and use unlawful means to save themselves; such <hi>forsake their own Mercy: for Salvation is of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>

Nor yet doth Prayer, which seeks Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the Lord, exclude our own <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,</hi> and the use of all lawful <hi>Means</hi> for the procuring our own Safety. <hi>Ministers</hi> may and must Preach and Pray for't; and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi> in the several circles of Society act in order to it, and every <hi>common Person</hi> may one way or other be in his place instrumental for the good of the whole Body, whereof he's a Member.</p>

I say, <hi>in his place;</hi> for no man ought to go without Commission out of the bounds of his Calling; be his Intention to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick never so good.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Ark</hi> upon <hi>Davids</hi> order was to be removed, and the Oxen that carried it, stumbled and jolted it, <hi>Uzzah,</hi> who was one of the Drivers, without doubt out of a good intention, put forth his hand to hold it up. But he was for this his rash attempt smitten and died in the place, to the great surprize and affrightment of <hi>David</hi> himself, who now stumbled, as much as the Oxen had done before, that he knew not how to behave himself: nor dared he to bring it home to him, as questionless he had at first intended.</p>
            <p>Suppose our <hi>Ark,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of God among us, should totter, it is not for every Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driver to offer his helping hand; or if the Vessel of <hi>State</hi> should bulge and swag from side to side, it is not for every private person to take upon him the place of Steersman. <hi>Scripture is not of private Interpretation;</hi> nor ought the Law, or the Affairs of <hi>State</hi> and Mysteries of <hi>Government</hi> to be so neither.</p>
            <p>We read in <hi>Ezek.</hi> Ch. 10. of a <hi>Wheel</hi> within a <hi>Wheel,</hi> that is, I suppose (for I do not take


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61393:15"/>
upon me to be an Interpreter of Prophecies,) the <hi>Church</hi> within the <hi>State.</hi> It is said there, that <hi>the Wheels went along, but they did not turn,</hi> they only went as the Head guided them, that is, the <hi>Cherub;</hi> (for the four <hi>Cherubs</hi> had each his Wheel) and the <hi>Cherub</hi> was a sign of Gods Majestatick presence. The <hi>Moral</hi> is plain. We are not to turn these <hi>Wheels,</hi> but let them go as the <hi>Cherub</hi> directs them. Besides, these Wheels themselves, it is said, were <hi>full of eyes,</hi> so that they could see which way they went, and did not perform a blind obedience to the <hi>Cherub</hi> neither. What may we gather from hence?</p>
            <p>We must let God and his <hi>Cherubs,</hi> his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents, govern the World, and in Cases of doubt and danger, refer our selves to the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Authority of our lawful <hi>Superiours,</hi> whose Business it is and their great Concern too, to look after these things, for they have greater stakes to lose than we Inferiours have.</p>
            <p>But now see our Unhappiness? Every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nowadays sets up for a <hi>State-mender,</hi> every Company of ordinary persons, wherever they meet, so manage their Discourses, as if they were a <hi>Committee of Council</hi> to regulate the Affairs of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Government.</hi> But alas!

How did he restore our Religion after Queen <hi>Maries</hi> short Reign? How did he bring back our <hi>King,</hi> our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> after the late <hi>Usvrpation?</hi> The Wheels of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> mov'd, as the Heavenly <hi>Cherubs</hi> guided them, without turning, without almost the help of man, at least without any Violence or Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Further, we may be assured, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall attempt to re-introduce <hi>Popery</hi> hither, does but go about to build up the Walls of <hi>Jericho.</hi> God Almighty will take care of us, if we be not wanting to our selves, if we but <hi>commit</hi> our selves to him.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Assurance</hi> is made out in these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Wicked,</hi> such as certainly our <hi>Adversaries</hi> are; for the Laws of God and Man condemn their Practices.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61393:16"/>
Their flourishing <hi>Condition</hi> is but short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd; For <hi>they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither</hi> or <hi>fade away as the green herb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for their mischievous <hi>Designs</hi> and wicked <hi>Attempts,</hi> God can by strange and wonderful ways discover, (as he hath done) their hellish <hi>Plots;</hi> he can blast and defeat their ungodly <hi>Projects;</hi> he can weaken their Power, or deny them the opportunity of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their intended <hi>Mischiefs;</hi> nay, which we must not deny to the worst of men, he can, (and I heartily pray, he may) change their <hi>Wills,</hi> alter their <hi>Minds,</hi> and turn their <hi>Hearts;</hi> at least, he can by his Providence or his Grace abate their <hi>Pride</hi> and asswage their <hi>Malice,</hi> (which put them upon these wicked execrable Practices) as well as by his Power confound their <hi>Devices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And then as to the <hi>Pious,</hi> those who <hi>commit their way to God and trust in him,</hi> he will either protect them <hi>from</hi> Danger, or preserve them <hi>in</hi> it, or support them <hi>under</hi> it, and at last give them a good issue <hi>out of</hi> it; besides those everlasting Retributions, which will infinitely transcend all the momentany afflictions of this Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61393:16"/>
And all these several <hi>Instances</hi> I might fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish with <hi>Proofs</hi> out of the <hi>Psalm</hi> it self, and back them with terrible <hi>Threats</hi> on one side, and comfortable <hi>Promises</hi> on the other; but that I fear I should far exceed my Time and tire your Patience.</p>
            <p>Only as to the <hi>Issue</hi> of such Trials, let me accommodate to our purpose a passage or two out of the Story of that <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> described at large <hi>Act.</hi> 27. wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> was concern'd. It was a great blessing to the rest to have <hi>him</hi> in their Company.</p>
            <p>When the Storm arose, he tells them, they should not have left <hi>Creet;</hi> there they might have rode safe. 'Tis our Case; we have too many of us quit our Establishments: had we continued there, were we united among our selves, <hi>Rome</hi> durst not attack us. Our Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Divisions have laid us open, and given our Enemies the advantage against us. I wish we could but unite in the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of <hi>Protestants:</hi> for there is none of those, that separate from the <hi>Church,</hi> but are fond of that <hi>Name</hi> still; though 'tis to be feared of some of them, that by the cunning Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those jugling <hi>Priests,</hi> that have crept


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61393:17"/>
in amongst them, they have lost much of the <hi>Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Storm increasing, they are fain to lighten the <hi>Ship</hi> of her lading, and throw away her tackle and furniture, and let her drive. However <hi>Paul</hi> assures them of their Lives, if they will be ruled, though the Vessel were to miscarry. The <hi>Sailers</hi> hearing that, would have got off in the long-Boat, and left the rest to shift. That <hi>Paul</hi> hinders and obliges them to trust God as well as the rest; for their deserting the <hi>Danger</hi> would have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, (as I understand the Story) the flinging up the <hi>Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand the <hi>Souldiers</hi> were as <hi>rude</hi> as the others <hi>fearful,</hi> and are as forward now to cut the poor Prisoners throats, as they were a while ago to cut the Boat-ropes; for which their only pretence was, that they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their Escape by killing them, who poor Souls expected every minute to be drown'd. This Storm was allayed by the good natur'd <hi>Centurion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you see there was a Tempest <hi>within,</hi> as well as <hi>without;</hi> and there are two sorts of People to raise it, the <hi>Fearful</hi> and the <hi>Boistrous.</hi> This Storm <hi>within</hi> being appeased, the Storm


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61393:17"/>
               <hi>without</hi> did them the less hurt; for they all escaped with their Lives to shoar. Whatever we fear from our <hi>Popish</hi> Adversaries; may we, I pray God, ever be quiet and at Peace among our selves.</p>
            <p>Then let <hi>Euroclydon</hi> blow, let the <hi>Romish</hi> Synagogue act with all the spite and malice, with all the Craft and Force, that Hell can furnish her with, against the best of <hi>Churches;</hi> though our Hull should by Gods just Permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion lose her Tackle and be put a drift, I should not altogether despair.</p>
            <p>And I doubt not, but we have <hi>Magistrates</hi> and others, of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> spirit and the good <hi>Centurions</hi> temper, who will by their <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Advice</hi> hinder and prevent those <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> and <hi>Disorders,</hi> which the <hi>fear</hi> of some and the <hi>fury</hi> of others among our selves may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise bring upon us; which, I say, weak Apprehensions and ungrounded <hi>Jealousies</hi> on one hand, or boistrous <hi>Passions</hi> and turbulent Humors on the other hand, may ingage us in. For though every one be obliged to have a <hi>Zeal</hi> for his <hi>Religion,</hi> for his <hi>Country,</hi> nay for his own <hi>Interest;</hi> yet if that <hi>Zeal</hi> transport us to act irregularly; if it be not a <hi>Zeal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Knowledge,</hi> according to Duty, we do


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61393:18"/>
but Christen <hi>Frenzy</hi> and wild <hi>Rage</hi> by the name of <hi>Zeal;</hi> and what our <hi>Adversaries</hi> have all along done and still do, justifie and sanctifie <hi>Villany,</hi> by intitling it to the Cause of <hi>Religion:</hi> which is all one, as if we would design to list <hi>Satan</hi> and his black Friends into Christs <hi>Militia,</hi> and fetch Auxiliaries from Hell <hi>to fight the Lords battles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all, may some ill-minded one say, that I have all this while been perswading you to stand still and suffer your selves to be wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into common ruin. No; I did at first suppose our <hi>Danger,</hi> and I have been offering the best <hi>Advice</hi> that Scripture affords, how we may be safe. For I have throughout the whole Discourse taken <hi>David</hi> along with me, a man after Gods own heart; (for so 'tis in the Title said to be a <hi>Psalm of David)</hi> and in his words have delivered the <hi>Exhortation,</hi> that you would <hi>trust in God,</hi> and <hi>be patient in well-doing;</hi> nor have I denied our own <hi>Endeavours</hi> too in the use of <hi>lawful means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And such kind of <hi>Counsel</hi> you will find e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where scattered throughout the whole <hi>Book of Psalms;</hi> a Book fit to be daily perused by all pious persons, especially in dubious and dangerous times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61393:18"/>
But then from <hi>Scripture</hi> they will appeal to the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and will tell us, that a man is obliged to do any thing, all he can, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve himself, and that every thing in that Case becomes <hi>ipso facto</hi> lawful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Self-preservation,</hi> it is true, is one of the greatest and tenderest Concerns, that <hi>Nature</hi> has; who has by secret and vigorous <hi>Instincts</hi> taught every Creature to provide for its Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and to fly Danger.</p>
            <p>But how, to give an <hi>Instance,</hi> does the little <hi>Brood,</hi> when they see a <hi>Bird of prey</hi> hovering o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their head, seek to preserve themselves, but by taking shelter under the <hi>Dams</hi> wings? a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> the <hi>Psalmist</hi> oft makes use of, when he speaks of <hi>Divine Protection;</hi> as where he says, <hi>Hide me under the shadow of thy wings, till these calamities be overpast.</hi> Whereas should the silly Creatures take wing and flutter about, they would, instead of saving themselves, give their Enemy the advantage of making his stoop upon them.</p>
            <p>Further, <hi>Religion,</hi> to which the very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments of <hi>Nature</hi> are to give place, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed us, that even <hi>Self</hi> is not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd by unlawfulmeans. For <hi>Evil is not to be done,</hi> whatever <hi>Good may come of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:61393:19"/>
Besides, which is the ground of our very Christianity, our blessed Lord hath made <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial</hi> the Character and Badge of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <hi>He that will be my Disciple,</hi> says he, <hi>let him deny himself and take up his Cross, and follow me:</hi> and <hi>He that loves father or mother, house or land, or life it self more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Nor do I see, how this <hi>Self-denial</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way reconcileable with <hi>Self-preservation,</hi> in that sense as some people take it; as if it were lawful for a man to do any thing, though never so <hi>sinful;</hi> to take any course, though never so <hi>unlawful,</hi> to preserve himself. This way of preserving our selves may indeed make us <hi>Gnosticks</hi> or <hi>Hobbists</hi> or <hi>Libertines,</hi> but cannot truly denominate us <hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When all is done, 'tis the far better and the more eligible of the two, to <hi>suffer</hi> evil, than to <hi>do</hi> it. And this suffering condition, be it as it will, will have much more of <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in it too, than any sinful <hi>compliance</hi> or wicked <hi>opposition</hi> can have.</p>
            <p>These Directions then of <hi>doing our duty</hi> and <hi>trusting in God,</hi> are the best and only means of securing our selves against those Dangers, our <hi>Enemies</hi> threaten us with. For if we act like them, and make no more Conscience


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61393:19"/>
of using <hi>unlawful means</hi> to <hi>preserve</hi> our selves, than they have done to <hi>destroy</hi> us; if we shall be found alike <hi>Evil-doers</hi> and <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressors</hi> as they are, though in a different way; we must expect from an impartial God the same Doom, as is in time to pass upon them, to be <hi>cut off</hi> and <hi>rooted out;</hi> when on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>the Meek-spirited shall inherit the Earth:</hi> and those who <hi>trust in the Lord</hi> and continue <hi>doing good</hi> and minding their own duty, <hi>shall</hi> by so doing <hi>dwell in the Land, and verily they shall be fed;</hi> they shall be preserved, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and provided for; and <hi>the end of the Upright-man shall be peace;</hi> and <hi>the salvation of the Righteous shall be from the Lord,</hi> who will <hi>help them, and deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him;</hi> and those who <hi>depart from evil and do good shall dwell for evermore;</hi> they shall live happily, they and their Posterities, in this World, and shall be Blessed in the World to come to all Eternity.</p>
