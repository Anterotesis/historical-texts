         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

ſeen in every Countenance; expreſſing the glad Hearts
of all the Gueſts: Only his Brother <hi>Nicholas</hi> ſeem'd to
wear a cloudy Brow, and appear'd meancholy unto
that degree, that it was taken notice of by ſeveral; but
he excus'd it by pretending ſome Indiſpoſition; which
thoſe that knew him beſt, thought he had no occaſion
to excuſe, it being only the Effect of his own natural
and moroſs Temper; of which his Brother took no
notice, for his fair Bride had took up all his Thoughts.</p>

               <p>IT is obſerved by Naturaliſts, that Spiders will ſuck
Poiſon from the ſelf-ſame Flowers, from whence
the better-natur'd Bee will extract Virgin Honey: Juſt
ſo it was with Mr. <hi>Nicholas Truelove,</hi> the Marriage of
his eldeſt Brother, which was a general Occaſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
to all others, gave him the greateſt Diſcontent
imaginable; of which, (whatever his Pretences
were) this was indeed the true and only Reaſon: His
Brother <hi>Arthur</hi> having liv'd a Batchelor till about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
four Years of Age, he had fondly conceived that he
wou'd never marry; and then by Conſequence all the
Eſtate his Brother had, wou'd fall to him and to his
Children: But now his Brother marrying a fine and
beautiful young Gentlewoman, by whom he cou'd
not doubt of having Iſſue, and thereby ſeeing all his
Hopes defeated, the mighty Diſappointment overcame
him, and touch'd his covetous and ſordid Temper to
the Quick: So that his Diſcontent became too viſible
to be diſſembled; which his Brother perceiving, was
very ſenſibly afflicted at it; and wou'd be often asking
of him what was the occaſion of it; but <hi>Nicholas</hi> as
much as poſſibly he cou'd avoided ſpeaking to him; and
by endeavouring to hide the Malady, made it the more
apparent.</p>

My dear Brother, I must confeſs that you've been always
kind, above what other Brothers uſe to be; and therefore I
ſhou'd be the most ungrateful amongst Men, ſhou'd I be
wanting in my just Acknowledgements; or have one thought
within my Breaſt, I ſhou'd not make my Brother privy to:
But as Diſtempers come without our leave, ſo neither will
they go, but when Heaven pleaſes. And if ſometimes I do
appear to indulge it, 'tis as my Siſter very well obſerv'd, the
melancholy Conſtitution I am ſubject to, inclines me ſo to do.
But my dear Siſter <hi>(addreſſing himſelf to her)</hi> I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to take your Counſel, and come and ſee what Cheer you
keep at home, and go ſometimes a hunting with my Brother,
and uſe all means I can to conquer this ſo troubleſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.
<hi>And ſo began to be more merry with them.</hi>

during which time, his Brother's; Wife was deliver'd
of a fine and lovely Boy.</head>
               <p>AFter this kind Viſit made by Mr. <hi>Arthur</hi> and his
Lady to his Brother <hi>Nicholas,</hi> manifeſting ſo much
Kindneſs to him, he had a ſtrange coufuſion of Thoughts
within him; his wicked Purpoſes were ſtagger'd, and
he began to boggle at the Execution of his wicked De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns:
For he had once reſolv'd to kill both his kind
Brother and his Wife, that ſo he might be Lord of his
Inheritance; but this unatural Reſolution (upon his
cooler thoughts) began to be too horrid in his Eyes;
as well as it had too much Danger in it: He knew his
Brother and his Siſter's Vertues, had made 'em well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd
by all the Country, and had few Enemies; and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30855:4"/>
if ſuch a Fact ſhou'd be commited, 'twou'd be a thing
impoſſible to hinder the Diſcovery: But now their
Kindneſs had ſo over come him, that the Ingratitude
of ſuch an Act, was by his better Genius, ſet forth in
its true Colours to his Soul, which had not yet loſt all
remainders of Humanity: He alſo thought that time
(which in each Age produces mighty Alterations)
might bring about his black Deſigns by ways leſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous;
and that he might obtain his Ends without
that load of Guilt, which ſuch a horrid and infamous
Action muſt needs have brought upon him.</p>
               <p>Having thus ruminated in himſelf, he puts on the
moſt pleaſed Countenance he cou'd, and told his Wife
(who was a Woman that deſerv'd a better Husband,
and unto whom he nevar durſt communicate the leaſt
of thoſe black thoughts that haunted him) that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to go ſee his Brother, and repay him his kind
Viſit, and there ſee if he cou'd divert himſelf, and ſhake
his melancholy Humour off: Which the good-natur'd
Gentlewoman was extreamly glad to hear, and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Reſolution all ſhe coul'd.</p>
               <p>When he came to his Brother's, he was received by
him and by his Siſter, with all the Kindneſs that was
poſſible; who were extreamly glad to ſee him look
with a ſerener Air than he was wont to do; and told
him they rejoyc'd to ſee him ſo much mended. To
whom he pleaſantly reply'd, He'd took his Siſter's
Counſel, and was come thither to divert himſelf, and
ſhake his Melancholy off. His Brother was well pleas'd
with what he ſaid, and nothing was omitted which
might contribute to ſo good a Reſolution: He went a
hunting often with his Brother, and viſiting of other
Neighbouring Gentry, who now began to have a greater
Kindneſs for him, then e're they had before.</p>

But now the time was come for the young Lady to
be brought a-bed, and through the kind Aſſiſtance of
<hi>Lucina,</hi> was ſafe deliver'd of a young Son, to the great
Joy of all the Family. But that which was the Father's
Joy became the Brother's Grief; for by this Heir, he
ſaw himſelf and Children diſpoſſeſt of what he had ſo
long eſteem'd his own; and could not ſo contract his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Brow, but that ſome Clouds appeared within his
Face; but yet he wiſhed his Brother and his Siſter Joy,
and drank a Health to the long Life and Happineſs of
his young Nephew: Which as he truly wiſh'd not then,
ſo he obſtructed afterwards. But quickly after finding
this new Heir gave him a freſh Diſturbance, which he
was not willing ſhould be taken notice of, he therefore
told his Brother and his Siſter that his Occaſions did
now call him home, and ſo begged their Excuſe for his
Departure, and returned home again.</p>

by all he gave away; for ſuch was his extenſive Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that he never ſuffered any to go away an hungry
from his Door, nor diſcontented neither, as far as he
could help it: For he ſtill found the more he gave away,
letting Deſcretion always be his Guide, the more his
Wealth encreas'd upon his Hand. For what he thus
diſtributed abroad to ſuch as were fit Objects for his
Charity, was like the Seed, which with a liberal Hand
being ſhed upon the ground, brought forth a ſuitable
Increaſe in its appointed Seaſon. Nor was his vertuous
Lady idle in her Station; but being skill'd in the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Vitues of moſt Herbs and Flowers, her Cloſet was
a ſmall Apothecary's Shop, from whence on all occaſions ſhe
diſpenſed both Food and Phyſick to her needy Neighbours.
Whilſt both his vertuous Lady and himſelf thought themſelves
happy in each other, and in their little Son and Daughter,
in whom and in their Iſſue, they had the Proſpeſt of a kind of
Immortality intailed upon their Family; and did not doubt but
their Poſterity might live for many Ages yet to come. But ah
how differently do things fall out from what we oft imagine,
and other Scenes appear, than what at preſent is within our
Proſpect.</p>

ſome envious interpoſing Cloud has robb'd us of its Luſtre,
and brought a glooms Darkneſy o're the World? Juſt ſo it was
with Mr. <hi>Arthur Truelove,</hi> for on a ſudden his Health and his
Wife's too, were both exchang'd for Sickneſs; both failing ſick,
and both of one Diſtemper at the ſelf-ſame-time; but what that
was, neither themſelves nor their Phyſicians could determine,
but did reſolve it into ſome occule Morbiſick Matter, which
had been long a breeding, but now came to a Head, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to diſolve their earthly Tabernacle. What afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
made ſome reflect, as if his Brother <hi>Nicholas</hi> had offered
ſome foul Play to 'em, at an Entertainment that he gave 'em
at his Houſe about three Months before; when out of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of Kindneſs, he had 'em up into his Cloſet, and there gave
'em a Dram, which as he ſaid he kept for his own drinking; for
tho' they both remained well three Months after, yet there are
Poiſons may be ſo prepared as to lie latent ſo long time within
their Bodies and yet at laſt as ſurely kill; as if a Sword had pierc'd
their very Hearts; and that his Brother and his Siſter no'r mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted
it, can be no Argument; for neither did they in the
leaſt imagine how afterwards he dealt with their dear Children;
for if they had they ne'r had made him Guardian over'cm. But
be that how it will, certain it is, that as theſe vertuous Pair
found their Diſtemper attack 'em with renewed Violence,
and that it baffled the Phyſitians Remedies, they ſent with all
imaginable ſpeed for Mr. <hi>Nicholas Truelove</hi> to come to 'em;
who ſeemed to be exceedingly ſurpriz'd at the bad News; and

My dear Brother and Siſter, wonder not that you ſee me ſo diſturb'd;
for 'tis the most heart-killing Sight I ever yet beheld; to ſee you both
upon a Bed of Sickneſs, (you whom I love to that degree, not my own
Wife and Children are more dear to me) it drives me nigh the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of another World! O break my Heart, and let me not ſurvive it!
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30855:6"/>
Would my own Death might but preſerve your Lives, how much ſhou'd
I rejoyce to make the Exchange! But is there nothing that I can do
for you? No Help! No Remedy! What ſhall I do? <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Tears guſh'd out ſo plentifully, as made the Beholders
not to doubt of the ſincere Affection he had for 'em. And
made his truely loving-Brother ſay,</hi> Pray Brother do not add to
my Affliction, by weeping thus for me; my greateſt Trouble is to ſee
you grieve thus. As to myſelf and my dear Wife, we're pleaſed that
we ſhall go together to a World of Happineſs, where we ſhall have no
need of any thing that we ſhall leave behind us. Death is the common
Lot of all Mankind, and if it come to us ſooner than others, we ſhall
have this Advantage by it, that we ſhall thereby be the ſooner happy;
and freed from whatſoever can diſturb us. But I have one thing,
Brother to requeſt of you, and that is, That you'd take the Charge and
Care of my dear Children, for to you Care it is I ſhall commit 'em.</p>
               <p>To this the ſeemingly ſorrowful Brother reply'd, That <hi>tho
he had ſaid nothing to him, yet that unfeigned Love he always bore
to him, would infallibly engage him to take the ſame Care of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as he would do of his own:</hi> At which the ſick Couple being
very well ſatisfied, gave him many Thanks. But their Brother
was exceeding earneſt with 'em to try further means for their

No love between theſe two was lost, each was to other kind,</l>

            <l>The one a fine and prity Boy, not paſſing three Years old,</l>
            <l>The other a Girl more young than he, and made in Beauty's Mould:</l>
