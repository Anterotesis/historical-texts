            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
RICHARD NORTON,
of Southwick, <abbr>Esq</abbr>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO' I can't without Ingratitude,
Conceal the Exceeding Favours,
which the Town have shown this
Piece; yet they must give me leave to own,
that even my Vanity lay Husht, quite stifled
in my Fears, till I had securely fixt its Good
Fortune, by Publishing your Approbation of
it: An Advantage, which as it will Confirm
my Friends in their favourable Opinion, so it
must in some Measure, Qualifie the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Malicious. After this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
let the World Imagine, how Difficult it
is for me, not to Launch into your Character:
But since the smoothness of your Temper, and
Depth of Iudgment, are my chief Protection,
I am loath to Discompose you, by an Vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Repetition of those Virtues, which only please
<pb facs="tcp:97819:3"/>
you in the Practice: The World as little
wants the Knowledge of 'em, as you desire the
Recital.</p>
            <p>'Tis your Happiness, Sir, that your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
has fixed you above the need of Praise,
or Friends, yet both are equally Vnavoidable:
For even to your Solitude, Praise will follow
you, and grows Fonder of you for your Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
She Loves you for your Choice of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
those Noble Pleasures of a sweet Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement,
from which nothing but the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of your Countrey's Weal cou'd draw you.</p>
            <p>But as no Man can properly be made a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
whose Virtues have not in some sort Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
him for such a Care: So, Sir, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for me, that your Life and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are the best Herald's of Your Power, and
My Safety.</p>
            <p>Here, Sir, I must beg leave to clear my
self from what the Ill Wishes of some wou'd
have the World believe, that what I now Offer
you is Spurious, and not the Product of my
own Labour: And thô I am pleas'd, that this
Report seems to allow it some Beauties, yet
<pb facs="tcp:97819:3"/>
I am sorry, it has made a Discovery of some
Person's, who think me Worth their Malice.
This Dedication were little better than an
Affront, unless I cou'd with all Sincerity assure
you, Sir, that the Fable is intirely my own;
nor is there a Line or Thought, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Whole, for which I am Wittingly
oblig'd either to the Dead, or Living;
For I cou'd no more be pleas'd with a
Stol'n Reputation, than with a Mistress,
who yielded only upon the Intercession of my
Friend: It satisfies me, Sir, that you believe
it mine, and I hope what others say to the
Contrary, is rather owing to an Vnreasonable
Disgust, than their Real Opinion. I am not
Ignorant of those Oversights I have Committed,
nor have the Dissecting Criticks much Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
me: For 'tis Their Diversion to find
Fault; and to have none, is to them an Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
Disappointment; no Man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to go Free, while they don't spare one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
But as I write not in Defiance of their
Censure; so, after having Diverted you, Sir,
I shall not trouble my self for a Defensive
<pb facs="tcp:97819:4"/>
Preface. Had it not succeeded, I shou'd have
had Modesty Enough to impute it to my own
want of Merit: For certainly the Town can
take no Pleasure in Decrying any Man's La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
when 'tis their Interest to Encourage
'em; every Guest is the best Iudge of his own
Pallat, and a Poet ought no more to Impose
good Sense upon the Galleries, than Dull
Farce upon the Vndisputed Iudges. I first
Consider'd who my Guests were, before I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
my Entertainment, and therefore I
shall only add this as a General Answer to all
Objections, That it has every way Exceeded
mine, and hitherto has not wrong'd the House's
Expectation; That Mr. <hi>Southern</hi>'s Good
Nature (whose own Works best Recommend
his Iudgment,) Engag'd his Reputation for
the Success, which its Reception, and your
Approbation, Sir, has since redeem'd to the
Intire Satisfaction of</p>

                  <p>So far you may be in the right: For indeed good
Counsel is like a home Jest, which every busie Fool is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>Right—thus have I known a jolly Red-Nos'd Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
at Three a Clock in the Morning, Belch out Invectives
against late Hours, and hard Drinking: And a Canting
Hypocritical Sinner, protest against Fornication, when the

                  <speaker>Y. Wor.</speaker>
                  <p>Tho these are Truths Friend, yet I don't see any
Advantage you can draw from them. Prithee how will
you live now, all your Money's gone?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Y. Wor.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! very well, Sir, (tho faith my Father left me
but 3000 <hi>l.</hi>) one of which I gave for a place at Court, that
I still enjoy; the other two are gone after pleasure, as thou
say'st. But beside this, I am supply'd by the continual boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of an indulgent Brother; now I am loath to load his
good Nature too much, and therefore have e'en thought
fit, like the rest of my raking Brother-hood, to Purge out
my wild Humours with Matrimony: By the way I have
taken care to see the Dose well sweetned, with a swinging
Portion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah! <hi>Will,</hi> You'll find Marrying to Cure Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
is like Surfoiting to Cure Hunger: For all the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97819:10"/>
is, you Loath what you Surfeit on, and are only
Chast to her you Marry—but prithee, Friend, what is
thy Wife that must be?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Y. Wor.</speaker>
                  <p>Why faith, since I believe the matter is too far
gone for any Man to Postpone me, (at least, I am sure, thou
wilt not do me an Injury to do thy self no good) I'll tell
thee—you must know, my Mistress is the Daughter
of that very Knight to whom you Mortgag'd your Estate,
Sir <hi>William Wisewou'd.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, she's an Heiress, and has a 1000 <hi>l,</hi> a year in
her own Hands, if she be of Age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I suppose the Old
Man knows nothing of your intentions. Therefore prithee
how have you had opportunities of promoting your Love?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Y. Wor.</speaker>
                  <p>Why thus—you must know, Sir <hi>William</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very well acquainted with the largeness of my Brothers
Estate,) designs this Daughter for him, and to Encourage
his Passion offers him, out of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> own Pocket, the Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Blessing of 5000 <hi>l.</hi> This Offer, my Brother, knowing
my Inclinations, seems to embrace; but at the same time,
is really in Love with his Neice, who lives with him in the
same House, and therefore to hide my design from the Old
Gentleman, I pretend visits to his Daughter, as an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
for my Brother only, and thus he has given me day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opportunities of advancing my own Interest.—nay,
and I have so contriv'd it, that I design to have the 5000 <hi>l.</hi>
too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>
                  <p>How is that possible, since I see no hopes of the Old
Mans consent for you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Y. Wor.</speaker>
                  <p>Have a Days patience, and you'll see the effects
on't; in a word, 'tis so sure, that nothing but delays can
hinder my Success; therefore I am very earnest with my
Mistress that to Morrow may be the Day. But a Pox on't,
I have two Women to prevail with, for my Brother Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
every other Day with his Mistriss, and while I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling
him, I loose, Ground in my own Amour.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, has not your Mistriss told you her Mind yet?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Y. Wor.</speaker>
                  <p>She will I suppose, as soon as she knows it her
self, for within this Week, she has chang'd it as often, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97819:10"/>
her Linnen, and keeps it as secret too; for she wou'd no
more own her Love before my Face, then she wou'd shift
her self before my Face.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lov.</speaker>
                  <p>P'shaw! She shows it the more, by striving to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Y. Wor.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, she does give me some Proofs indeed, for
she will suffer no body but her self to speak ill of me, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
uneasy till I am sent for, never pleas'd when I am
with her, and still Jealous when I leave her.</p>

                  <p>Well, for once I'll take your advice; for to say
Truth, a Man is as unfit to follow Love with an empty

                  <p>How hard is it to find that Happiness which our

No 'tis their Pride, and vain desire of many Lovers,
that robs our hope of its imagin'd Rapture: The Blind are
only happy! For if we look through Reason's never erring
Perspective, we then Survey their Souls, and view the
Rubbish we were Chaffring for: And such I find, <hi>Hilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria's</hi>

                  <p>Indeed she gave a great proof on't last Night

                  <p>One that Heaven intended for a Man; but the

is of another Species. A thing that affects mightily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule
himself; only to give others a kind of necessity of
praising him. I can't says he's a Slave to every New Fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

some Old, or advanceing some New Piece of Foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and thô it. don't take is still as well pleas'd, because it
then obliges the Town to take the more notice of him:
He's so fond of a Publick Reputation, that he is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant

and your self too; she is too high Spirited not to take you
at your word; and you are too much in Love, not to ask
her Pardon.</p>

                  <p>Well, dear <hi>Amanda,</hi> thou art the most Constant
Wife I ever heard of: Not to shake off the Memory of an
ill Husband, after 8 or 10 years absence; nay, to Mourn
for ought you know for the Living too, and such an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,

                  <speaker>Am.</speaker>
                  <p>Because 'tis hopeless! For if he be alive, he is Dead
to me; his Dead Affections not Virtues self can e'er retrive;
wou'd I were with him, thô in his Grave!</p>

                  <p>In my mind, you are much better where you are!

have furnisht him with nothing but an improvement of

wou'd take him for an Inhabitant of that Country. And

'twas more an Affectation of being Fashionably
Vicious, than any reasonable dislike, he cou'd either find

                  <p>O! Madam it looks Particular, and gives
the whole Audience an Opportunity of turning upon
me at once: Then do they conclude I have some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Business, or a Fine Woman to go to at
least: And then again it shews my Contempt of what
the dull Town think their cheifest Diversion: But if I
do stay a Play out, I always set with my Back to the
Stage.</p>

                  <p>Then every Body will imagine I have been
tired with it before; or that I am jealous who talks to
who in the Kings Box. And thus, Madam, do I
take more pains to preserve a Publick Reputation, then

                  <p>Most Women have a wrong Sense of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
as some Men of Courage; if you don't Fight
with all you Meet, or Run from all you see, you are
presently thought a Coward, or an ill Woman.</p>

                  <p>You say true, and tis as hard a matter now a
days for a Woman to know how to converse with
Men, as for a man to know, when to draw his Sword:
For many times both Sexes are apt to over-act their
Parts: To me the Rules of Virtue have been ever
sacred; and I am loath to break 'em by an unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Understanding: Therefore, dear <hi>Hillaria,</hi> help me,
for I am at a loss—Can I justifie, think you, my
intended design upon my Husband?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hill.</speaker>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Am.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, if I Court and Conquer him, as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
am not I accessary to his violating the Bonds
of Marriage? For though I am his Wife, yet while
he Loves me not as such, I encourage an Unlawful
Passion; and though the Act be safe, yet his Intent
is Criminal: How can I answer this?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hill.</speaker>
                  <p>Very Easily, for if he don't intridgue with
you, he will with some Body else in the mean time,
and I think you have as much Right to his Remains
as any one.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Am.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay! but I am assured the love he will pretend
to me is vicious: And tis Uncertain, that I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
his doing worse elsewhere.</p>

                  <p>Tis true, a Certain Ill ought not to be done
for an Uncertain Good. But then again of two Evils
choose the least; and sure tis less Criminal to let him
love you as a Mistress, than to let him hate you as
a Wife: If you Succeed I suppose you will easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
your Guilt in the Undertaking.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>To say truth, I find no Argument yet strong
enough to conquer my Inclination to it. But is their
no danger think you of his knowing me?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hill.</speaker>
                  <p>Not the least, in my opinion: In the first
place he confidently believes you are Dead: Then he
has not seen you these eight or ten Years: Besides,
you were not above sixteen when he left you: This
with the alteration the small-Pox have made in you,
(tho' not for the worse,) I think are sufficient Disguises
to secure you from his knowledge.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Am.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay and to this I may add the considerable
amendment of my Fortune; for when he left me I
had only my bare Jointure for a Subsistence: Beside
my strange manner of receiving him.</p>

                  <p>With all my Heart, I love to be at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom

                  <p>I can't help a little concern in a Business

Design must prosper; yet my Fears say 'twere
Happiness too great.—Oh! to reclaim the Man I'm
bound by Heaven to Love, to expose the Folly of a
Roving Mind in pleasing him with what he seem'd
to loath, were such a sweet Revenge for slighted Love,
so vast a Triumph of rewarded Constancy, as might
perswade the Looser part of Womankind ev'n to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake

Women do the name of Whore: But I'Gad they both
Love the pleasure of being so: Nay Faith, and 'tis as

                  <speaker>Sir Nov.</speaker>
                  <p>No Faith, Sir; for let me tell you, 'tis
not the Coldness of my Lady <hi>Freelove's</hi> Inclination: But
her Age and Wrinkles that won't let her Cuckold her
Husband: And again, 'tis not Sir <hi>Iohn Wou'dlook</hi>'s
Aversion to Dress; but his want of a fertile Genius,
that won't let him look like a Gentleman: Therefore
in Vindication of all well dress'd Gentleman, I intend
to write a Play, where my Chiefest Character shall

                  <p>Why, after <hi>I</hi> had been from her beyond Sea, about

                  <p>Because she grew stale, and <hi>I</hi> cou'd not Whore
in quiet for her: Besides she was always exclaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

which she so violently oppos'd, that <hi>I</hi> fancy'd a Pleasure
in it, which since <hi>I</hi> never found; for in one Month <hi>I</hi> lost
between Eight and Ten Thousand Pound, which <hi>I</hi> had

thoughts of Vertue? Now, if you can, shake off

greater then is usual in our Sex: if so, can you
believe I have no farther sense of Happiness than what this
Empty, Dark and Barren World can yield me! No, I have

Church with her—Faith, Madam, in my mind this discourse
is a little out of the way. You told me I shou'd be acquainted
with your condition, and at present that's what I had rather be

your thoughts of Virtue, Sir?—By all my Hopes of Bliss

                  <p>Your words confound me, Madam; some wondrous

for its fatal birth! What is it I must answer you?</p>

                  <speaker>Am.</speaker>

only Notion?</p>

                  <p>Let me consider, Madam, <stage>(Aside)</stage> What can this
mean? Why is she so earnest in her demands, and begs me to
be serious, as if her Life depended on my Answer—I will
resolve her, as I ought, as Truth, and Reason, and the strange
occasion seems to press me.—Most of your Sex confound the
very Name of Virtue; for they wou'd seem to live without
desires, which cou'd they doe, that were not Virtue but the
defect of unperforming Nature, and no praise to them: For
who can boast a Victory when they have no Foe to Conquer?
Now she alone gives the fairest proofs of Virtue, whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
and whose force of Reason can curb her warm Desires,
when Opportunity wou'd raise 'em: That such a Woman may
be found I dare believe.</p>

allow'd a Woman may be Virtuous—How will you excuse
the Man who leaves the Bosome of a Wife, so qualified, for
the abandon'd pleasures of deceitfull Prostitutes! Ruines her
Fortune! contemns her Counsel! loaths her Bed, and leaves
her to the lingring miseries of Despair and Love: while in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of all these wrongs, she his poor forsaken Wife meditates
no Revenge, but what her piercing Tears, and secret Vows to
Heav'n for his Conversion yield her: yet still loves on, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and unshaken to the last! Can you believe, that such a
Man can live without the stings of Conscience, and yet be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of his Senses! Conscience! did you ne'er feel the Checks of
it! did it never, never tell you of your broken Vows?</p>

And yet your words are utter'd with such a powerfull Accent,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97819:47"/>
they have awak'd my Soul, and strike my thoughts with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

                  <p>Hold Gentlemen! I shou'd blush to be oblig'd to that

                  <p>Now Sir <hi>William;</hi> You have shown your self a
Father. This prudent Action has secured your Daughter
from the usual consequence of a stol'n Marriage; a Parents
Curse. Now she must be happy in her Love, while you have
such a tender Care on't.</p>
