         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

admits of no curiositie, and craues but the

was drawne by. Many stormes it has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
for company, but more hot dayes,
which haue Sun-burnt my lines, aswell as
face. And though I am on shore, yet I
feare, the Sea is not yet calme; for each
Booke, sent into the World, is like a
Barke put to Sea, and as liable to censures
as the Barque is to foule weather.</p>
            <p>When I landed, I thought to haue hoyst saile no more; but Friends
whose breath is powerfull, haue once more lancht mee into the deepe
(and may it proue a faire gale) by commanding these iude and indigested
notions from me, which being accompanied with truth and simplicite
(the soule of Historie) are then like the Elements, In most splendour
and perfection when least mixt and troubled with Quotations or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations

            <p>I challenge no thankes for what I publish, nor reward, because I plead

guilty to vnworthiness, and all the imperfections you can throw vpon
youth or hast.</p>
            <p>None can thinke so ill of mee, as I doe of my selfe, the rather, that
your pardon may flow freely, and worke a kind of miracle vpon mee, in
raising my dead thoughts to life. And that my wel-wishers (who haue
offered, a ciuill violence to friendship, in forcing my priuate satisfactione,
into publique shame) may owne my faults, which must reflect vpon them,
since in my obedience, I haue made all my errours, theirs.</p>
            <p>More Authours I might haue vsed, and rendred my selfe, to some
more vsefull in this way. But I was on my way to many Countries, and
Trauellers haue enough to doe with varietie, In men and manners,
which make vp a Librarie to themselues; besides the scituations and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
beings of Cities and Territories, seeming better then to labour in
vncertaine stories, which not only perplexe the hearers, but beget in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulitie,
oftentimes amongst the credulous.</p>
            <p>My other trauailes into some parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> I could haue troubled
you withall, but I loue not repetitions, nor to entertaine you with that
from my selfe, I hate in others, besides, since all Trauellers, are subject
to imputations of vntruths, I had rather goe farre to fetch it, and send
you farre off, to disproue it; then giue you libertie of condemning
mee at home.</p>
            <p>If my thoughts haue wandred, I must intreat the wel-bred Reader to
remember, I haue wandred through many deserts, as to afford mee his
helpe to call home my Itenerant Notions, to fixe them (by his fauour)
vpon this Iland of Iles, <hi>Great Brittaine:</hi> which like a reall Map of the

said to be fifteene miles high: though a third part may well suffice to

The twelfth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> wee had the winde high and large; so that on
the fourteenth day we had the Sunne in our <hi>Zenith,</hi> his declination
fourteene degrees, where note, that only then, when wee are <hi>Nadyr</hi>
to the Sunne, we haue no shadow. And againe, whereas to all Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters
in the Temperate Zone, their shadowes are euer North in the
Sunnes Meridian. When you haue past the <hi>Zenith,</hi> the shade becomes
iust contrary, which made the Sun-burnt <hi>Arabs</hi> to wonder in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
to <hi>Europe,</hi> as the Poet speakes:
<q>
                  <l>Ignotum vobis Arabes, venistis in Orbem,</l>
                  <l>Vmbras mirati Nemorum, non iresinistras.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And here (the wind something abating) wee felt excessiue heat, that,
and the losse of a Sailer falling from the shrouds into the mercilesse
waues perishing their, was all our sorrow. Yet a little was added, for
vnder sixe degrees, at midnight so violent and forcible a storme of
raine poured on our Ships; that in lesse space then two houres, the
Skiffe, which was fastned to the vpper Decke was fild with it; &amp; which
aggrauated the gust, was the fury of Thunder and flashes, which migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
raged with the raine. Nor is this weather rare about the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall;
by Marikers termed the <hi>Tornadoes:</hi> and tis so vncertaine,
that now you shall haue a quiet breath and gale, and suddenly an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
violent gust, and storme, so fierce, that many times the ships
will feele no helme.</p>
            <p>Yet in my iudgement this is most vnhappy to the Sailers, who in
those raines handing in their sailes and standing on the De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or Scuruie, Feauers, Fluxes, Aches and the like: which (did they
but forbeare <hi>Arack</hi> or strong liquours, and shift themselues out of
those nasty infectious wet clothes, when they take their rest) might be
preuented.</p>
            <p>And besides these, they should be wary, where, and when they was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ships, are sunke or dasht in pieces by it, and when the raine is spent,

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1612. after many conflicts, betwixt the <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Persian,</hi> they
were both so prest by neighbour Countries, whom they had vsurpe
vpon, that they propounded Articles of peace and friendship. To
which end, King <hi>Abbas,</hi> sends his Ambassadour to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in
company of <hi>Nassuf Bashaw,</hi> the <hi>Visier</hi> and Generall to <hi>Sultan Achmat,</hi>

returned fortunately, and enriched with two hundred and thirtie

other Countries.</p>
               <p>At whose entrance, there expected him Ambassadours from most
parts of <hi>Europe:</hi> from the Emperour, King of <hi>England, France, Poland,
Hungary, Netherlands,</hi> and from <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Visier Nassuf,</hi> a while after receiued the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> token of
loue and respect, three <hi>Cabbaes</hi> or vests of cloth of Gold, a Sword, a
Shash, and a Courser.</p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassadour finding much ceremonious welcome
from the <hi>Turkes,</hi> to shew his bountie, as the <hi>Sultan Achmat</hi> in great
brauerie passed by his lodging, threw amongst his guard a hundred
bales of Silke, which got him much loue and esteeme among them.</p>
               <p>At his Audience hee deliuered his Masters present, foure hundred
bales of raw Silke, a rich Dagger, many rich <hi>Persian</hi> Carpets, and
Clothes of Gold and Siluer, a Bezar stone so bigge as a Hens Egge,
nine bags full of Turquesses and the like.</p>
               <p>These gifts were acceptable to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> (all the Princes of
<hi>Asia,</hi> affect complements of that nature) so after many Treaties, at
length the <hi>Persian</hi> Ambassadour accepted of these conditions, that the
King of <hi>Persia</hi> should pay a Tribute of two hundred Camels load of
Silke, that the <hi>Mirza,</hi> or Prince of <hi>Persia,</hi> should content himselfe
with the title of <hi>Bashaw</hi> of <hi>Tauris,</hi> and that the <hi>Cadi,</hi> or Iudge of
<hi>Tauris</hi> should thence forth be elected by the <hi>Turke.</hi>

great and potent with the <hi>Grand Signiors;</hi> that few Ambassadours
could be heard or dispatched without their licence and good will; and
which was accomplisht by briberies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nassuf,</hi> in the height of his fortunes, at the instigations of his wife
(the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> daughter) was strangled in his bed by eight <hi>Caepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi>
and his treasure (no lesse then eighty bags of gold, and in stones
then two bushels of Diamonds and Pearles) fell to his Master, for
which perhaps this infortunate Vsurer, lost his life, a iust recompence

the English Merchants Ships, then in <hi>Swally</hi> rode shot off two hundred

               <p>In <hi>October 1627. Shaw Selym</hi> (by some cald <hi>Iangheer</hi>) the great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gull</hi>
died, hauing beene sicke not aboue three dayes, and if the vulgar

               <p>But though this Nobleman, was in great repute with the <hi>Mogull,</hi> yet
<hi>Curroones</hi> life was so dissolute and hopelesse of bettering (hauing with

               <p>According to which Oath, so soone as <hi>Iangheer</hi> was dead, <hi>Assaph

aswell to discharge themselues, from their obligation as to giue
satisfaction vnto the people, who affected him.</p>
               <p>And with all speed <hi>Assaph Chawn</hi> (who now thought hee had done

to say truth, the best and most approued Souldier through <hi>India,</hi>
for many yeares a heauy and mortall Enemy to <hi>Curroon,</hi> and but
lately reconciled vnto him, by great perswasions and entreaties of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph
Chawn,</hi> who wrought him, to be his Protector, and with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to safegard him to the Kings Metropolis and Royall seat <hi>Agray</hi> (a
City first built by Wine-god <hi>Bacchus</hi>) with this aduantage, that in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habet
Chawns</hi> company (one much beloued and feard by the people) he
might aduance securely, and without whom, he could neuer haue pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Amadavad,</hi> the way to <hi>Agray,</hi> nor had hopes to enioy the title of
an Emperour, <hi>Curroone</hi> was so generally hated by the vulgar.</p>
               <p>And that hee might leaue nothing vndone, which might aduantage
his resolutions, (according to the order of the late <hi>Mogulls</hi>) he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his name from <hi>Currone</hi> to <hi>Shaw Iehan</hi> (or King <hi>Iohn</hi>) thinking by
that in some sort to appease the peoples hatred: whom as he past, hee
saw ill-willers to his happinesse, and entending to oppose him in a
battle, being formerly a proclaimed Traitour and a Rebell, which he
wisely fore-saw and feared, hoping by policie more than force to
winne them to him: so that he sent them word, hee came in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and that rather then offend them, would returne, though his
iourney was to submit himselfe to his Nephew, late made <hi>Mogull,</hi>
from whom he doubted not to receiue forgiuenesse.</p>
               <p>But when the people heard that <hi>Mahabet Chawn</hi> was in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and had an Army, their thoughts were changed, such was the
great and generall loue and feare they bore that Champion; whom
as they knew to be victorious, and therefore durst not much oppose
him, and most seuere in iustice and truth by which they thought <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roone</hi>
Inheritor, and without opposition, suffered him to march, through
all the Country vnto <hi>Agra,</hi> eleuen hundred miles, from that place
where the messenger found him at, and fiue and twenty hundred, from
<hi>Cashmeer,</hi> where <hi>Iangheer</hi> his father died.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, <hi>Normall,</hi> when she saw her Husband the Great
<hi>Mogull,</hi> was dead, and that by his last Will, had nominated <hi>Blockee</hi> for
Emperour (to secure which, he had made all the <hi>Vmbrawes</hi> to sweare)
she was almost distracted.</p>
               <p>Fearing her deuices to Crowne <hi>Seriare</hi> her Sonne (and yongest to
<hi>Iangheer</hi>) would be preuented, but assuring her selfe, feare nor wishes
without action could performe it, shee assumes courage and with those
forces, she then had (which she euer kept about her for her safety) she
hoped to effect her long desires, which was to seaze vpon <hi>Blockee,</hi> the
new King, and vpon her Brother <hi>Assaph Chawne,</hi> whom shee resolued
to strangle, knowing hee was euer against her Sonne <hi>Seriare,</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20350:23"/>
to make Emperour, <hi>Curroone,</hi> who had wedded his Daughter:
and the reason, why she euer had an Army about her, euen in her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
time, was this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mahabet Chawn,</hi> being a most valiant and iust man, and one who all
his Masters life time (whom he knew to be a quiet and good King) he
had done faithfull seruice to, noting her abusiue carriage and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ouer her aged Husband the <hi>Mogüll,</hi> how shee heaped vp a masse
of treasure, and apparantly discouered her aymes to make her Sonne
<hi>Seriare</hi> King. And that on the other side <hi>Assaph Chawn</hi> did what hee
could to conferre that dignity vpon <hi>Curroon,</hi> and both of them labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to disinherit <hi>Blockee,</hi> the true heire to the Crown, both by bloud,
nomination and descent, for these causes <hi>Mahabet Chawn,</hi> cryes out
vpon them, and to the World discouers their combinations and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
whereat they were so netled, that they got the good <hi>Mogull</hi> to
banish him, hoping then, to perfect, what they had begun.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Mahabet Chawn,</hi> was no baby, nor would he suffer such indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
And thereupon, gathers an Army of twenty thousand Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
with which hee set vpon them all vpon a sudden, as they were
passing ouer a Riuer, and so amazed their Army, that hee tooke the
<hi>Mogull</hi> Prisoner, and conueighed him to a Tent (not for all the world,
purposing any hurt vnto him) whom hee knew to be good, and only
abused by <hi>Normall</hi> his Queene. Who in this interim had passed safely
ouer the Riuer, with most part of the <hi>Lescar,</hi> or Army, which shee
immediatly put into Battaglia, and stood in her owne defence, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
her mortall Enemy <hi>Mahabet Chawn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gull and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners by a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</note> that straight way gaue her
battaile, slue most of her men, tooke her prisoner, and commanded
her head off, to satisfie his fury, with her brothers <hi>Assaph Chawn,</hi> who
being wiser of the two, in the skirmish fled amayne to a strong Castle,
where he entrencht himselfe till hee had petitioned the <hi>Mogull</hi> for his
liberty and reconcilement, with <hi>Mahabet Chawn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Who so soone as the Battaile was ended, gaue order to his Army to
pursue <hi>Assaph Chawn,</hi> and to behead him, and brought forth Queene
<hi>Normall</hi> to receiue her iudgement, but shee got so much fauour from
<hi>Iangheer,</hi> the olde <hi>Mogull</hi> her doting Husband, That with teares hee
begd her life, from this his Champion, who though hee knew, would
be destruction to him or his: yet to shew his loyaltie to his Master, he
released her, and became friends.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Assaph Chan,</hi> became so intimate with <hi>Mahabet,</hi> that hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled
with him to goe into <hi>Decan,</hi> to <hi>Sultan Curroone,</hi> to conduct him
to the Court, to beget his pardon from his Father, which hee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
did by his power and respect, conueighed <hi>Curroone</hi> to <hi>Agra,</hi> and
set the Crowne vpon his head, as is and shall be better spoken of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Queene <hi>Normall,</hi> euerafter, by licence from her Husband, kept a
a peculiar Army for her safety, and vnder colour of that, so soone as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20350:23"/>
the great <hi>Mogull</hi> was dead (as I haue said before) shee sought to
seize the new <hi>Mogull,</hi> and her Brother <hi>Assaph,</hi> to make them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
and then doubted not to set the Imperiall Crowne vpon her
sonne <hi>(Sultan Seriare's)</hi> head, his yeares being twenty, and capable
in her opinion to rule so vast an Empire.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Assaph Chawn,</hi> not ignorant of her intents and malice to him,
so soone as <hi>Iangher</hi> was dead, and <hi>Blockie</hi> proclaimed <hi>Mogull,</hi> hee
forth-with raises an Army, and approaches hers, where hee pitched
and sends vnto her, to assure her of his loue and diligence to do her
seruice, excuses what hee had done, being bound by oath, and that
vpon better considerations, hee had forsaken <hi>Blockie,</hi> to conioyne
with her, not fearing any opposition, when both their Armies were
vnited, and that hauing the young King in their power, shee might
then commit herselfe vnto security, and rule as formerly.</p>
               <p>The Queene, knowing who it was, that profered this, euen her
owne Brother, and then farre from his Sonne in Law <hi>Curroone,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieues
him and admits of him. Imagining this occasion, ministred
security to her designes, and by which (whiles she bleared him with
shew of friendship) shee might more easily kill him, and the new
King, on a sudden.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Assaph Chawn</hi> knowing her ambitious qualities, when hee
had well viewed her seuerall forces, and got out of her, where her
sonne <hi>Seriare</hi> lay (which was at <hi>Lohore,</hi> with foure thousand horse,
for feare of <hi>Mahabet Chawn,</hi> as was divulged) hee suddenly raised
his Army and forsooke her, desiring all the Nobles with their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to accompany him, and <hi>Blockie</hi> to <hi>Lohore,</hi> to apprehend the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
<hi>Seriare</hi> (as he called him) then in Armes and in competition for
the Empire, with those his forces, entending to strengthen Queene
<hi>Normall,</hi> his mothers Army, the better to attempt it.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Normall</hi> perceiued her brothers treachery, she blamed her
credulity, and sorrowed, that she had not strangled him: but hoping
to confound him, shee followed with a resolued Army to encounter
him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Assaph Chawn,</hi> though this power was more then hers, and
therefore feared her not, yet hauing other things to execute, and
to hazard the victory at Sea, might hinder his other designes, he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
speedily through the Mountaines, and to preuent her speed to
ouertake him, made great stones be cast downe thither to stop the
passage, which is so narrow that scarce two men can passe together;
this so hindred his sisters speed, that ere she could cleere the passage,
<hi>Assaph Chawn</hi> met with <hi>Sultan Seriare,</hi> who with eight thousand
men, was comming to ioyne with the Queene his mother, as she
had willed him.</p>
               <p>His Army was small and quickly vanquisht, himselfe imprisoned
and sent so backe vnto <hi>Lahore,</hi> where so soone as he arriued: <hi>Blockie</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:20350:24"/>
was againe proclaimed <hi>Mogull</hi> by his Protector <hi>Assaph Chawn,</hi> who
thereupon sent a Herald to <hi>Normall,</hi> to come submissiuely vnto the
Court, and he offered her faithfully to haue remission, and that the
Infant <hi>Mogull</hi> out of his clemency should forget all former Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
and that shee should not want all honour due to so great a
Queene, with maintenance agreeable, for the wife of so great a
<hi>Monarch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Normall</hi> when she had wisely accounted her distresses and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
that her sonne was a Prisoner, her owne life in danger, and
no possible meanes left to make <hi>Seriare</hi> King: came and submitted
to <hi>Blockie,</hi> who gaue her assurance of life and liberty, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of her former Guard or Army. And during <hi>Blockies</hi> raigne
she liued happily and with content. But when <hi>Currone</hi> came to be
Emperour, he tooke her Army from her, ransackt her treasures, slue
her friends, and confined her to a priuate Castle for her life, where
now she liues in no small misery.</p>
               <p>But to continue our History,<note place="margin">Queene Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals miserie.</note> when <hi>Assaph Chawn</hi> saw all the
Princes of the bloud then in his power, in <hi>Lahore,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Mogull,
Sultan Blockie, Sultan Seriare</hi> his Vncle, two sonnes of <hi>Sultan Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rues,</hi>
elder brother to <hi>Sultan Currowne</hi> (and poysoned by <hi>Azaph
Chawn,</hi> the yeare before at <hi>Brampore</hi>) two sonnes of the old Kings
elder brother <hi>Morad,</hi> or <hi>Amurath,</hi> who because they should vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
be incapable of the Crowne and Kingdome, caused them to
be baptized into the Faith of Christ (against their wils conferring a
greater glory on these two despised Princes then the Monarchie &amp;
beliefe of all <hi>Mahometan</hi> Dominions could doe) by some <hi>Portugall</hi>
Iesuites. For the <hi>Alcoran</hi> (their Law booke) forbids a Christian to
weare a Crowne, where <hi>Mahomet</hi> is worshipped. These fore-named
Princes who were Christened, were by all the <hi>Indians,</hi> knowne to
be of the bloud Royall, and from them therefore receiued esteeme
and good respect, but by all the Court, were slighted, despised and
cald Christians, which title and other indignities (so reputed of by
them) they obediently suffered, expecting one day some deliuerance,
which now was giuen them by <hi>Assaph</hi> the Duke, who sent them to
<hi>Lahore,</hi> and there destroyed them.</p>
               <p>The other Princes were reserued to a more opportune massacre,
vntill <hi>Sultan Currown</hi> had entred <hi>Agra,</hi> and receiued the Imperial
Crowne and Scepter, with other Ceremonious rites due to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation,

and carried their heads as a Trophie and sure testimonie of his villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
vnto <hi>Agra,</hi> where <hi>Currown</hi> expected them.</p>

all imputing it to <hi>Azaph Chawn,</hi> who sware his innocency, and that
he had no hand, in the bloud of these slaughtered Princes.</p>
               <p>The Nobles, when they saw no remedie, none else that had title
to the Crown, being aliue: they vnanimously trauelled to <hi>Agra,</hi> and
submitted to <hi>Curroon.</hi> Who (for his greater safety) forgaue them
and embraced them, but awhile after, his old humour shewed it
selfe, for by degrees, vpon small occasion he beheaded and strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
most of them, to the terrour of the rest, and to settle himselfe
in a more quiet tyranny: after the murther of Father, three Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
three Nephewes, and two Cozen Germans.</p>
               <p>Since which, his Queene (<hi>Assaph Chawns</hi> Daughter) died, and hee
hath taken his owne Daughter to be his wife. These crying sinnes,
haue apparantly drawne downe Gods heauy iudgements vpon those
Countries: by those immediate and late plagues of Pestilence and
Famine, neuer heard of the like in those parts before, the Sword
will doubtlesse follow in Gods appointed time. For hee will haue
glory by punishing those from whom he cannot haue his glory. And
<hi>Curroon</hi> (or <hi>Shaw Iehan</hi>) is not yet sensible of those castigations.</p>

Heifers.</p>
               <p>Their mariages are sometimes secret, other times performed with
much superstition. They hate Poligamy, but so extreamely honour
Wedlocke, that they seldome are vnmarried at seuen yeares of age.
The men goe in triumph about the streets one day, and the Bride
next, and if it chance, a childe die, ere he be married, the parents of
him that died, procure some Damsell (to whom for a Dowrie, they
giue some Dynaes of Gold to betroth him) to lie one night with
the deceased.</p>
               <p>Their Funerals are these, they bring the dead corps neere to their
Churches, where they sacrifice him to ashes, in costly perfumes, in
Aromatique Gummes and Spices. Sometimes the woman throwes
herselfe into the fire, and burnes together with her husbands car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casse
deriuing to themselues much reputation and glory amongst the
suruiuers.<note place="margin">Indian Fun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they continue that louing custome deuoutly to this day, as
shall be spoken of in my description of those parts following.</p>
               <p>Another Ceremony in Funerall pompe among the <hi>Persae</hi> is this:
They put the dead body into a winding sheet, all the way his kindred
beat themselues till they come within fiftie or an hundred paces
neere the monument or buriall place, their the <hi>Herboods</hi> or Priests,
oppose them, attired in yellow Skarffes and Turbants, who take the
dead body (leauing them their, where they stand, till the action be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
the <hi>Nacesselars,</hi> Priests carry it to a little shed, or furnace, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
hidden raptures by fire, vnto the fire. Which done, they place
the corps, a top of a round stone building twelue foot high &amp; eightie
about, the entrance only to the North-east side, where is a small
grate, through which they conueigh the body, into that monument:
which is flat aboue, wholy open, and plaistered with smooth white
loame, in the midst is a hole, discending to the bottome, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues
that putrefaction and vncleannesse, issuing from the melting
bodies, which are laid there naked, and in a twofold roundnesse, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the Sunnes fiery rage, and deuouring appetites of Vultures
and Cormorants, who vsually prey their: tearing their flesh, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordering
it, so that the vglinesse and fearefull stench of the vnburied
bodies (in some Dormitories three hundred) is so violent, that (vnlesse
the raritie of wonders vrge a Trauellour to view them) they are
better to be spoken of, then seene. And note that after the corps are
laid there, the <hi>Persae</hi> will neuer approch to see the buried, nor doe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20350:27"/>
they enquire after them, but grieue exceedingly, that a Christian
should goe thither to view them, or tell them of it. The good are
laid in one, and the bad in others; all are carried in Iron coffins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
wood is sacred to the fire, which they adore.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>These <hi>Persae</hi> are descended of the ancient <hi>Persians,</hi> who adored
fire. For the <hi>Persians,</hi> that now inhabit <hi>Persia,</hi> are extract from <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi>
and came hither with <hi>Tamberlaine,</hi> or the <hi>Turko-mans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A like people now liue among the <hi>Persians,</hi> called <hi>Gowers,</hi> who
were of the old inhabitans. They yet pray to the fire, and are much
abased by the <hi>Moores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vtmost point South of this <hi>Indian</hi> tract is cald Cape <hi>Comri</hi> or
<hi>Comrein</hi> from the Aequinoctiall eight degrees to the North. That vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
point is in <hi>Mallabar,</hi> a Kingdome ruled by the <hi>Sambreyn</hi> or King.
On the otherside the point, is the Kingdome of <hi>Narsmga Negapatan,</hi>
and <hi>Maesulipatan.</hi> In which Countries are found Wonders and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Entertainments.</p>
               <p>So soone as a stranger arriues, of what Countrey soeuer, hee shall
presently haue his choice of many Virgins, and choosing one he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
for a small price; she guides him to a lodging, and performes his
domestique affaires what euer, at bed and board, all the time of his
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20350:27"/>
abode their discharging her duty and priuacie very punctually: and
he during that season must beware of familiarity with other women,
which if he subiect himselfe to, she aymes to poyson him.</p>
               <p>At his departure,<note place="margin">Strange cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of the Indians.</note> he payes her wages to her parents, she returnes
home, with credit and oftentation.</p>
               <p>Here also, when any Noble or Inferiour person enters wedlocke,
he takes it for a courtesie, that any stranger will accept the first nights
ceremonie with his Bride.</p>
               <p>Some (but most are <hi>Peguans</hi>) weare bels of gold fixt to their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
within the bell is an Adders tongue dried, which sounds har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniously.</p>
               <p>The women goe most part naked, except a cloth which should
couer those parts, made to be priuate.</p>
               <p>In some of these Cities, the Paynym parents, sow vp almost the
wombe of their female children, which is only then dissected, when
she is married.</p>
               <p>Their vilest ceremony is this. That at the marriage of a Virgin,
the Bridegroome, to honour the Deuillish Idoll, brings her afore
the <hi>Pagode,</hi> or Idoll; who commonly is of a tall stature, and shaped
vgly, in his priuy parts he has a bodkin of gold or siluer, an intended
Instrument, to violate her chastitie. Which, they suppose obtained,
by the Pagotha, such time, as she is forcably put vnto his Engine, the
the sharpnesse being such, that the bloud issues not only thence, but
from other parts of her wounded body, this done, with great ioy
and applause she returnes to her Pagan husband, and if shee be with
childe that yeare, tis supposed the Pagod got it.</p>
               <p>The vsuall Coine in <hi>India,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Moguls Coine.</note> within the <hi>Moguls</hi> Territories are Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,

a Pice is in English money, a half-peny, a Mammoodee is twelue
pence, a Rowpee, two shillings three pence, a Dyna thirty shillings,
an English shilling values twentie two Pice, or a Mammoodee and
one Pice. A Spanish shilling (which is a fourth part of a Dollar) giues
twenty fiue Pice, a Riall of eight giues fiue Mammoodees wanting
three Pice, and an English twentie shilling peece (too many of which
are conueighed among the <hi>Indians</hi>) will at <hi>Surat</hi> giue twentie two
shillings sixe pence, and in <hi>Persia</hi> twentie fiue shillings at least.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Swalley</hi> Road (such times, the ships come thither) the <hi>Bannyans,</hi>
haue Tents and straw houses pitcht neere the water side in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
their they sell Callicoes, Cheney Sattin, Cheney ware, Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats,
Turquesses, Sugar and such like. Many little boyes at your
going ashore will desire to doe you daily seruice, which they will
carefully performe for two pence a day, they prattle English and

These people will neither eat nor drinke, with any Christian, yet
they will conuerse and cozen one without scruple: the Deuill
warrants them.</p>
               <p>They will not entertaine a stranger to their houses, iealous of

ships (then too much abused, by the bragging <hi>Lusitanian</hi> and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated)

the greatest mischiefe, came hereby vnto the English, for the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious

the Souldiers went to the Duke, saying, shall wee sit
idle, whiles the <hi>English,</hi> by stealth and secrecie exhaust all our hopes
of benefit and riches, whereat the Duke (glad of such aduantage)
replyed, if so, then goe and haue your desires, whereupon they broke
open the houses, and store of what was valuable, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
masters of all they found, whiles the confident Sailers, lay
bragging of their victories a ship-board. And when they were possest
of what was done, they exclaimed, as men possest, but the <hi>Persians</hi>
vnderstood them not, nor cared they what their meaning was, seeing
they terrified the <hi>Adye,</hi> giue loosers leaue to prate.</p>
               <p>Yet they found enough to throw away, by that small, sufficiently

               <p>Only Captaine <hi>VVoodcocke</hi> had good luck and bad, lighting vpon a

               <p>
                  <hi>LArr</hi> is a Citie vnder the Latitude of twenty seauen degrees
and forty minutes North, tis vnder the Iurisdiction Royall of
<hi>Emang Ally,</hi> the <hi>Chawn</hi> or great Duke of <hi>Shyras,</hi> from whence
tis distant fourteene easie dayes iourney, and from late passed
<hi>Gombroon,</hi> seuen dayes, or sixscore <hi>English</hi> miles or thereabouts: all
the Countrey for foure hundred miles together, is desart, sterile
and full of loose sand and dangerous, it also shewes huge high Hils,
on euery side, trauell which way you will: without grasse, riuer
herbes, or what else, a Pilgrim, in those inhospitable Desart might
desire (a few Date-trees excepted, which stand rather as markes to
passe by, than other seruice) and did not the <hi>Tancks</hi> (their watery
<hi>Magazens</hi>) assist them, neither were the people able to abide there,
or Trauellers to find passage.</p>
               <p>The Citie of <hi>Larr,</hi> is the principall place for Iustice and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
within that sandy Kingdome (cald by some by the same name,
though in my iudgement in <hi>Susiana) Shushan</hi> being not many dayes
trauell distant thence.</p>
               <p>The Citie is very ancient, and thirty yeares agoe had fiue
thousand houses in her, of which three thousand were turned topsie
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20350:33"/>
turuy by an Earth-quake, two thousand at this day is her number.</p>
               <p>Tis now famous for nothing but a Castle and <hi>Buzzar,</hi> which is
large, strong, and beautifull, tis in a sort Quadrangular, though of
vnequall Angles. The extent from North to South is an hundred
and seuentie paces Geometricall, and from East to West, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and ninetie.</p>
               <p>The Castle is built at the North end vpon a high aspiring Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
well stored with Ordnance brought from <hi>Ormus:</hi> the order
and scituation of this Fort and Fabricke, equalizing if nor preceding
any other in <hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this poore City is a <hi>Mesquite</hi> or Temple, framed in some

his Resurrection shortly to waite on <hi>Mahomet</hi> (of whom hee
prophesied fiue hundred yeares before his knaueries.) And tis sure
great <hi>Pluto</hi> loues them so dearely, that hee will not part with them,
because he expects these <hi>Mussulmen</hi> there also.</p>

               </p>
               <p>About thirty yeares since, the Duke of <hi>Shyras</hi> (commanded by
the King) subdued this Kingdome, ruined one Castle and built ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
slue many of the Citizens, ransacke the Towne and sent home
to <hi>Shyras</hi> so much Treasure as burthened seuen hundred Cammels;
much, in respect of the great famine and pouertie of this Kingdome,
but most part raised, I beleeue, out of those great and many Carra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uans,
from <hi>Babylon, Tauris, Cazbeen</hi> and <hi>Spawhawn,</hi> traffiquing to the
<hi>Portugall,</hi> while <hi>Ormus</hi> had Trade and Riches.</p>
               <p>The poore King, though his life was granted him, when hee was
dreaming of other matters, an vnexpected Semiter, (to end his stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems)
cut off his head, and by death of all his Progeny establisht
the Soueraignty vnto the <hi>Persian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Maps place <hi>Larr</hi> by a great Riuer, wherein they are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20350:34"/>
so exceedingly, that within a hundred miles is not any Riuer or
Riuolet.</p>
               <p>After nine dayes abode in <hi>Larr,</hi> wee continued our iourney to
<hi>Shyras,</hi> most of vs mounted vpon good Mules, who though slow, are
sure of foot, and Emblemes of Sobrietie.</p>
               <p>Our first night we pitcht our Tents not far from <hi>Larr,</hi> and could
not trauell next day, by reason of an immoderate showre, that made
the earth very slippery, whereby the Camels could not foot it.</p>
               <p>The raine as it seldome fals here (not a showre sometimes in fiue
yeares) when it fals, brings incredible ioy and profit to this people,
and Sun-burnt Countries, and with which happinesse, it often brings
with it mischiefe and sorrow, for we were told here, that six yeares
since, such a violent storme of raine vnburthened it selfe neere this
place, and caused such a sudden Deluge and Cattaract, that a Carra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uan
of two thousand Camels perisht, and were cast away by it.</p>
               <p>Next night we slept in <hi>Techoa,</hi> or <hi>Ded-chow,</hi> (which signifies the
Towne vnder a Hill) where the <hi>Calenter</hi> of <hi>Larr, Cogee-Obdruza</hi>
tooke farewell of vs.</p>
               <p>At this <hi>Techow,</hi> are many pretty Tombes, not any buried without
memorials, a mile from this Towne we see threescore blacke Pauil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
wherein we found nothing, but what gaue mirth and beautie.</p>
               <p>These are a people, who liue wholy in Tents, and obserue the
customes of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> they haue no certaine habitation, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in motion, they graze and feed here and there, with all their
substance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persians</hi> stile them <hi>Vloches,</hi> or Shepheards, these <hi>Nomades</hi> are
well described by the Poet.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Next day we roade by a huge wall, cut by incredible labour out of
the solide Rocke, as a secure defence against the inuading <hi>Persian,</hi> the
Kingdome of <hi>Larr</hi> their terminating.</p>
               <p>Thence we came to <hi>Berry,</hi> a small Towne, and Schoole for the
<hi>Arabique</hi> Tongue, this has a <hi>Mosquit,</hi> or Church, promising much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre
off, but deceiues the expectation neerer hand, howbeit tis much
honored by the people, for being an euerlasting Dormitorie as they
belieue, to their Learned Pseudo-prophet <hi>Emaum-zaddey-a-meer-amaddey-Ally,</hi>
a man of great length in name, power, and eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares antiquitie: his Tombe is foure foot high, and eight in
length, couered with a white linnen cloth, the sides painted and set
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20350:34"/>
forth, with Poesies of <hi>Arabique,</hi> neere him are fixt two Speares and
Ensignes curiously wrought, and vpon the Coffin lie a set of great
Beades, with which he vsed to worke miracles, a top of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
hangs a Globe to expresse his power and greatnesse, in the wall
are round Glasses (such as are in Doue-houses) in which these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
see representations of their sinnes. And (which is not least estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
I perceiued a stone pendent neere the wall which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
for a valuable Relique, they say, the Prophet vsed to lay this
stone on the shoulders of the erronious, the miraculous waight and
vertue of which was such, as reduced him into a right path. A little
pot comes next to our description, it has an vnguent of great vertue
and Antiquitie in it, which it seemes cannot be spent, and is of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
force for weake eyes:<note place="margin">The Alcoran, or Alfurcan, is their Booke of Religion.</note> to crowne all, his Booke, yet no <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furcan,</hi>
of deuotion is laid vpon him as too worthy the vse of sinners.
The Church vnder foot is neatly matted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as the Church has su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
so the Priests haue ceremony, none can enter with boots
or shooes on, because the place, they say, is holy.</p>
               <p>Hence we trauelled to <hi>Bannarow,</hi> at which Towne the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
met vs with musique and welcome; three Drummes and sixe
Muskets. The ruines of an ancient Castle, lately demolist by
the <hi>Persians,</hi> shewes its ribs vpon the top of a stupendious mount,
the view of one side inclining to the Towne, the other to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts.
Our next nights <hi>Manzeil</hi> was at <hi>Goyoam,</hi> a Towne at least of a
thousand Houses,<note place="margin">A Iugler.</note> after our reposing there, a <hi>Persian Hocus-Pocus,</hi>
affronted vs, he performed rare trickes with hands and feet, hee trod
vpon two very sharpe <hi>Persian</hi> Semiters with his bare feet, then laid
his naked backe vpon them, and suffered a heauy Anuill to be laid
on his belly, on which two men beat two Horse-shooes forceably:
that tricke done, he thrust Kniues and Arrowes thorow many parts
of his armes and thighes, and by meere strength of his head, tooke
vp a stone of sixe hundred pound waight, which was fastned to the
ring with his haire, and in like sort tore asunder a Goats heads with
his fore-locke, still crying <hi>Allough whoddow,</hi> or great God to helpe
him, we gaue him perticular requitals, and so left him and the towne,
where lies entombed the Prophet <hi>Meleck Mahumet,</hi> one very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for fomenting the precepts of his master <hi>Mahumet,</hi> when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by the <hi>Sarazens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thence our Trauaile was through the Wildernesse, riding so
long and carelesly that some of vs lost our company, straying in
that comfortlesse Desart, but next day wee found out the Carauan,
At this time such raine, thunder and lightning fell vpon vs, that wee
were imprisoned in our Tents. Yet on we went next day, and lodged
at night in <hi>Whormoot</hi> (or Towne of Dates) by the way was a Tombe
of the harmelesse Shepheards, hung with threeds tripartite, each
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20350:35"/>
threed beautified with parti-couloured wooll, and at each end was
placed a Puppet or Pagod to protect it.</p>
               <p>The two and twentieth day we dislodged a wilde Bore, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shot nor Dogges preuailed against him. That night wee slept in
<hi>Cutbobbow,</hi> and next in <hi>Mohouck,</hi> in which is a Monument of foure
famous Prophets, <hi>Hodgee, Mohomet, Izmael</hi> and <hi>Ally,</hi> buried foure

               <p>Thence to <hi>Caughton,</hi> next night to <hi>Vngea,</hi> next to <hi>Moyechaw,</hi>

Pearles and precious Rubies, his Beds pillow (saith the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour)

               <p>THe great Palace of <hi>Persepolis,</hi> is by the inhabitants (who lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

by which, it seemes they haue seene so many in their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
though now there be but nineteene standing, and one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
to the East, howbeit the ruines and ground of fourescore more,
are yet visible, this great roome was the Hall, and cut out of the
blacke shining Marble, wherein were placed a hundred white mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pillars, which gaue admirable beauty to it, each Pillar or Towre
is about fifteene foote high, each in rotundity forty squares, each
square three inches.</p>

               </p>
               <p>From this roome, is a stately prospect of all the Plaines thirty
miles about it.</p>
               <p>The ascent to this is cut out of the marble Rockes, the staires (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
their durance and beauty to this day) are ninetie fiue, and so
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20350:36"/>
broad that a dozen Horsemen may ride vp abreast together; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
ascent is twenty two foot high, at which is the gate (or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the said Hall) the breadth of the Gate is sixe of my paces,
the height of each side or Gate (engrauen with a mightie Elephant
on one side, a Rhynoceros on the other) thirty foot high, very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut out of the marble, fixt and durable for euer.</p>
               <p>A little further from the entrance are two Towres of like shape and
bignesse. Neere which is another part of the gate, wherein is engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
a <hi>Pegasus:</hi> an inuention of the <hi>Sculptor,</hi> to expresse his worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,
these are the portals to that <hi>Apollo,</hi> supported by a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
white marble Pillars, a top of which now inhabit the pious
Storkes: the fashion of this roome exceeds all the other in circuit,
and brauery.</p>
               <p>Adioyning is another foure-square roome, whose blacke marble
wals are yet abiding. Tis I say foure square, each square ninetie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
all foure amounting to three hundred and sixtie, it has eight
doores, foure of which are sixe paces broad, the other foure of halfe
that breath, euery doore has seuen engrauen marble stones fixt one
vpon another, each stone in length foure yards and height fiue quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
all which eight doores are exquisitely engrauen with Images of
Lions, Tygres, Griffins, and Buls of rare sculpture and proportion,
a top of each doore is of stone the Image of an Emperour in state,
holding in his hands a staffe and Scepter.</p>
               <p>A third Chamber ioynes to the former, which (these people tell vs)
was a receptacle for the Queene and Ladies, tis of a Quadrangular
but not equall forme, two sides sixtie, the other seuentie paces.</p>
               <p>A fourth Chamber is next, two sides twentie, the other two, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
paces, which Nurserie, though of blacke shining marble, is not
yet obscured in her glorie: the wals are rarely engrauen with Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of huge stature, and haue beene illustrated with Gold, which
in some places is visible, the stones in many parts so well polisht, that
they equall for brightnesse a steele mirrour: this Chamber has its
wals of best lustre. But Age and Warres, two great consumers of
rare monuments, has turned topsie-turuie, this, as many other things,
and left nought but wals to testifie the greatnesse of that glory and
triumph it has enioyed.</p>
               <p>At the highest of this Palace, is cut, out of the perpendicular
mountaine, the Images of a King (which may be <hi>Cambyses</hi>) adoring
three Deities, the Fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sunne, and a Serpent.</p>
               <p>The mountaine on the other side is also cut perpendicular, vp
which is no ascending, this is sufficient for this Theame, on which
I should not haue so much insisted, but for its worth, and that none
hath formerly in truth described it.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Persians</hi> say one <hi>Iamshet</hi> was the structor, whose Image is
frequently carued in most places, hee ruled ouer <hi>Persia,</hi> in nine Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents

from <hi>Noe,</hi> and is by Historiographers supposed sonne of <hi>Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi>
King of <hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Halfe a mile from <hi>Persepolis,</hi> is a Towne of two hundred houses,
cald <hi>Mardash,</hi> whose inhabitants so little know or value memory,
that they daily teare away the monument, for Sepulchres and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

               <p>Which they cannot doe, where the Rockes are fixt, in one of
which Hals described, is excellently engrauen, Battailes, Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombes,
Triumphs and the like.</p>
               <p>And though, some imagine, <hi>Persepolis</hi> to haue stretcht so farre as
<hi>Syras,</hi> which now is thirtie English miles distant. The distance does
not so much diswade me from it, as those high craggie mountaines
interposing them, and vnder the olde <hi>Persepolis</hi> is a plaine <hi>Horizon</hi>
East, another way.</p>
               <p>No doubt, but <hi>Syras</hi> may haue risen from her ruines, though built
in a distant place, as we see <hi>Tauris</hi> from <hi>Ecbatane, Bagdat</hi> from olde

<hi>Iamshet,</hi> fist King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and so from <hi>Noe.</hi> But I rather thinke its
deriuation is from <hi>Sheir</hi> or Milke, as <hi>Aleppo</hi> from <hi>Halip,</hi> which Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymies
are taken from plentie and pleasures: many Towns in these
parts agreeing so, as <hi>Whormoote,</hi> which is a Towne of Dates, <hi>De-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chow,</hi>
a Towne vpon a Hill, <hi>De-Gardow</hi> (a Towne of Walnuts, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The compasse of this Citie is about eight or nine miles, the greatest
extent from the South-east to North-west neere three miles, a farre
lesse compasse then those that write, it has twenty miles compasse,
and in it sixty thousand houses. Tis seated at the North-west end of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20350:37"/>
a large euen plaine, twenty miles long, and sixe broad, the sides en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed
with mighty Hils, vnder one of which this Citie is placed.
At the first view, it affords a very pleasing obiect, and by reason of
abundance of high Pyramidall Cypresse-trees, circumuoluing the
Towne, it seemes, a Garden, till at the entrance the Hummums, (or
hot Baths) and <hi>Moscheas,</hi> their Churches, by the refulgent splendour
of their bluenesse, gaine admiration in the beholders. The prime
beautie of this Citie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is her Churches and Gardens.</p>
               <p>Within the Citie are fourteene or fifteene Churches, most of
which are round like Theaters, their outside tyling, pargetted with
azure stones, resembling Turquoises.</p>
               <p>Two of these are more eminent then the rest, the one, for braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
has two Pillars or Steeples (as high as <hi>Pauls</hi> in <hi>London</hi>) couered
and wrought with blue and Gold, the Inside vast and vnfurnished,
shewing onely one small place allotted for deuotion. The other for
vse, whose superficies is <hi>Mosaicke</hi> worke, enterlaced with <hi>Arabian</hi>
Characters out of their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> in the entrance, yet speakes it selfe
rather a Royal Carrauan-raw, then a Temple, though nightly a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Lamps adorne it.</p>
               <p>Other Churches, haue beauty in them, and are most respected for
the buriall places of some famous Prophets, seruants to their adored
<hi>Ally</hi> sonne in Law and equall with them to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whose Iugling
trickes, haue so bewitched these Infidels, that Zeale and Wealth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
haue richly adorned their monuments with precious frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Brasse and Stone, and what Art is defectiue in, Nature and
Gold has made vp its wants, each Sepulchre boasting of an hundred
Lampes and siluer Sockets: in one of which is embalmed that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
man <hi>Shaw-Meer-Ally-hamzey,</hi> who this seuen hundred yeares
has waited vpon <hi>Ally</hi> in <hi>Acheron,</hi> for doing as was written in his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran.
The length of his Temple is sixtie paces, and the breadth so
many.</p>
               <p>In another, sleepes <hi>Sandan Emyr Amahow,</hi> a man who became <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets</hi>

they say, to worke Miracles.</p>
               <p>The Houses are of Sun-burnt bricks, flat a top, the windowes trel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
very curiously. And though generally they haue within, no
Ornaments after our fashion, yet some peculiar Houses, as the
Dukes. <hi>Shock-Ally-Beg. Ally-chon,</hi> and others may be competitors

               <p>Sultan <hi>Shock-ally-Beg</hi> (in whose House we had a Banquet and ciuill

He subdued all <hi>Larr, Ormus,</hi> and vnto <hi>Iasques</hi> for his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
and got a footing in <hi>Arabia,</hi> in this manner. Two Princes of
<hi>Arabia,</hi> contending for Soueraignetie, hee that was vanquisht, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
succour from this Duke, who entertaines him willingly, and
with twenty thousand Horse fights with his Aduersary, kils him and
becomes Lord of both Territories. The relieued Prince, thankes
him and desires to returne home. <hi>Emangoly Chawn</hi> cryes fie, at that,
could he with any honesty leaue him,<note place="margin">perfidie</note> that so had succoured him: the
Prince must stay, and in fine, becomes his Sonne in Law, and Father
at one time, for hee weds the Dukes Daughter, and the Duke his
Lands and Signiories, and keeps him prisoner.</p>
               <p>His Reuenues (as Merchants say) is foure hundred thousand <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes</hi>

Wire,<note place="margin">aud sports.</note> Cords, aud Wood, a toile and burthen for sixe hundred Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels,
and so commands them.</p>
               <p>At our entrance into his Metropolis, hee was two dayes iourney
thence, at his House of pleasure. Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> rode to him, to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20350:38"/>
acquaint him with our Ambassadours being there: hee knew it well
enough, and thought we should attend his leasure: so after wee had
reposed sixe dayes in the Citie, our Ambassadour acquainted <hi>Shocke-Aly-Beg</hi>
with his desire to part. What; replyed hee, would you goe
ere you see the Dukes face, he answered, his businesse swayed him
to another end, he came to see his Master. So the next day the Duke
came to <hi>Shiras,</hi> followed with two thousand horses, and rested two
dayes without sending or taking notice of vs.</p>
               <p>At length hee sent a Gentleman to our Ambassadour, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
of welcome, and bade him to visit him: our Ambassadour
sent him word hee had come so great a Journey, as excused him, if
the Duke would please to ride thither, he was his seruant.</p>
               <p>The Duke stormed exceedingly to see his greatnesse slighted, and
after a pawse fearing to affront him (because the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> had
before hand writ to him, and others through his Kingdomes as wee
traueld to respect vs) sent word, hee would come next day and see
him, but he did not, his sonne (a Gentleman of eighteene yeares old)
came to excuse his Father, and without any stay departed.</p>
               <p>Next day our Ambassadour sent the Dukes sonne word by <hi>Shocke-Aly-Beg,</hi>
he would trouble him, the Duke was not well pleased his
sonne should haue the visit, so that at our Ambassadours alighting,
we were conueighed into the Dukes Gallery, which was very long
and richly furnisht with Plate, rich Carpets, dancing Wenches and
<hi>Ganimeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke was set at the very end crosse-legged like a Taylour, but
his fierce aspect and brauery denied that title, hee stirred not one
foot, till our Ambassadour was at him, and then standing vp, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him, we had Wine, Women and a Banquet to accompany vs, and
after two houres stay departed.</p>
               <p>Next day (being the two and twentieth of <hi>March</hi>) we were inuited
to a Solemne and Royall Banquet.</p>
               <p>We were vshered into the Banqueting-house, a large open roome,
and supported with twenty Pillars richly gilded, the Roofe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bost
gold, the ground spread with rich silke Carpets, this looked into
a large foure-squared Court, round, in which were placed the prime
men of the Citie, and in another Court fiue hundred common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
all which the Duke had inuited to declare his greatnesse.</p>
               <p>The Banqueting Hall had a State at the end, of Crimson Satten,
embroydered with Pearles and Gold, vnder which hee sat directly
vpon the Carpets crosse-legged, on his right-hand was placed the
Prince of <hi>Tartarie,</hi> on the left our Ambassadour, next him sate the
Dukes eldest sonne, or <hi>Beglerbeggee</hi> (whose head three yeares after,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the yeare 1632. was strucke off, at command of the young
King vpon small reason) and to him the captiued King of <hi>Ormus</hi> (who
has fiue markes a day allowed for his maintenance) neere him sate
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20350:39"/>
the two desolate Princes his sonnes, in whose company wee were
placed, such as were Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>On the other side next to the Prince of <hi>Tartary,</hi> sate the Prince
of <hi>Georgia,</hi> a Gentleman of as braue a looke as euer liued, and no
lesse braue in Armes; his faith is Christian.</p>
               <p>During their stay, they were sad and melancholy, whose being
there, I could perceiue, was more to content others, then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>The rest of the Hall was fild with Sultans, chiefe Merchants and
<hi>Coozel-bashawes,</hi> the Banquet was very costly and plentifull, of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
dried meates, Dates preserued, preserued Peares, Pistachoes,
Almonds, Duroyens, Quinces, Apricocks, Myrabilans, Iacks, and
a hundred other Fruits and Spices, the <hi>Ganymeds,</hi> young Boyes in
Wanton habits, powred out Wine to such as loued it.</p>
               <p>At the end of the Banquet, the people without gaue a great shout,
crying <hi>Yough Ally Whoddaw Bashat</hi> (which was God be thanked.)</p>
               <p>Then the Duke himselfe entred, with thirty Gentlemen, <hi>viz.</hi>
slaues, in Crimson-satten-quilted-Coats and Turbants, euery Turbant
wreathed about with chaines of Rubies, Turquoises, Emeralds, and
the like of great lustre and value.</p>
               <p>The Duke himselfe was attired in a Coat imbrodered with siluer,
vpon it, he had a Vest or Gowne of great length, so thick powdered
with Orientall glittering stones that the ground of it could scarce
be seene, and twas inualuable, his Tulipant and Sandals had like
lustre.</p>
               <p>His not entring till the Banquet was finisht, so grieued our Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour;
that when he came (all the Company bowing their heads to
the ground) he sate still as discontened. For the truth is, the Duke
forbare of purpose, that his people might wonder at his greatnesse.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> bending very low, made bold to drinke to him,
in a bowle of pure gold, which the Duke bid him accept of for his
paines: the Duke perceiuing our Ambassadour so silent, smiled vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, drunke his health, and after a few complements, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>I had forgot the Trophies of his <hi>Ormus</hi> Victory, which is painted
in Gold by a <hi>Portugall</hi> Captiue, wherein are set downe the incam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

               <p>The fiue and twentieth day of <hi>March,</hi> or Lady day we left <hi>Shiras,</hi>

Mount, at whose top has stood a Castle, so fortified by nature and
industrie, that it was thought impregnable.</p>
               <p>A late rebellious Sultan, wearie of slauery manned it against his
Prince, the late victorious <hi>Abbas,</hi> who in person came against him,

the Sultan came downe, forced by the Deuill, who assured his
pardon.</p>
               <p>The Blocke rewarded him, and the old Wizard (ignorant of his

               </p>
               <p>Most of which troubles came vpon them by <hi>Cycala Bassa,</hi> whose
peculiar attempts I will only write of, hapning in memory of some
to this day liuing.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Cicala</hi> or <hi>Cigala,</hi> was sonne of a Christian Gentleman, whose
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20350:42"/>
life proued him a profest Enemy of the blasphemous <hi>Turkes,</hi> and in

and might haue beene counted in the number of the happy,
had not their sonnes vngracious life opposed their best content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>He turned <hi>Turke,</hi> and was Circumcized by perswasion of <hi>Ozman
Bassa,</hi> Generall against the <hi>Persian,</hi> for <hi>Amurath</hi> the Third, and lay at
<hi>Van,</hi> during those two Battailes, wherein <hi>Emyrhamze-mirzay</hi> the
vndaunted Prince of <hi>Persia,</hi> with his own hands, struck off the head
of the <hi>Sultan</hi> of <hi>Caraemit,</hi> Generall for the <hi>Turke,</hi> and wherein died
the <hi>Bassaes</hi> of <hi>Trepizond,</hi> and fiue <hi>Sanzacks</hi> with twentie thousand
<hi>Turkes.</hi> And that other victory ouer them by the same Prince at <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cazan,</hi>
neere <hi>Cazbeen,</hi> wherein for griefe died <hi>Osman</hi> the Valiant <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
and aboue three and twentie thousand <hi>Turkes,</hi> the <hi>Persians</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
very little losse, this was in <hi>Anno</hi> 1586. and though he boasted
of great matters, so soone, as hee descended into <hi>Media,</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi>
Prince, hunted him backe againe, not daring to abide a Combat with
that happy <hi>Mirza.</hi> So that had not <hi>Ozman</hi> at his death requested his
good vsage and continuance of Authoritie, the great <hi>Turke</hi> had vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discarded him. Howbeit all <hi>Amuraths</hi> Raigne hee was neuer put
vpon any valuable Employment, till in <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third his rule,
he helped them at <hi>Karesta</hi> in <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> after the famous siege of <hi>Buda</hi>
in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where, for all their valour and policie, they lost not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sixty thousand able Souldiers, but gaue ouer their hopes of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying
those parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cycala</hi> after this, insinuates so farre with <hi>Achmat</hi> the Great <hi>Turke,</hi>
Successor to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that to be reuenged vpon the <hi>Georgians,</hi> hee
grants him (power, to torture them, with) an Army of eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men, proclayming his cruell entended reuenge vpon them for
Rebellion, and agreeing with the <hi>Persian.</hi> But after much labour and
hopes, when it came to triall, his expectations and brags deceiued
him, in that, sooner then hee expected (forgetting both his former
mischances and <hi>Zellallybegs</hi> later ouerthrow) the <hi>Georgians</hi> (with
whom the <hi>Persians</hi> as in a common cause had ioyned themselues) set
vpon him, and wel-nigh routed his whole forces, and two moneths
after, by a supply of the <hi>Mirza, Shaw Abbas</hi> his eldest sonne (and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Shaugh Soffee,</hi> now raigning) with twelue thousand Horse,
they chased him to the Confines of <hi>Armenia,</hi> where <hi>Cycala</hi> resolued
to try his fortune once againe vpon them, and the fight indeed was
terrible and bloudy, but at last the <hi>Georgian</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Princes
preuailed ouer him and his amazed <hi>Turkes,</hi> who seeing resistance of
no worth, fled and gaue the <hi>Persians</hi> libertie to kill thirtie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of them, the <hi>Persians</hi> in the battaile hauing lost nine thousand,
which losse to the Great <hi>Turke</hi> was so great and sensible, that to this
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20350:42"/>
day, hee has cause to thinke on it. For vpon this Victory <hi>Cycala</hi>
fled into <hi>Iberia,</hi> and <hi>Abbas</hi> the King of <hi>Persia</hi> slaughtered all his
Garrisons in <hi>Teflis, Tauris, Cazbeen</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> that yeare regai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
no lesse, then they had anciently lost in the troublesome Raigne
of King <hi>Tamas,</hi> 1537. to <hi>Solyman</hi> the Magnificent, fourth Emperour

Georgians, Christians.</head>
               <p>SKander (or <hi>Alexander)</hi> was of late yeares King of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and
for his Valour, Iustice, Temperance, and other vertues, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
through most of <hi>Asia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Skander,</hi> as fortunate in many things, had this to his content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
added, the issue of three sonnes, got of his Wife, a <hi>Sarcashen,</hi>
her beliefe Christian, Descent Noble, and worth equall, to her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
attributes, but to speake poetically as the best beautie, wants not
blemishes, the best wits, vices, nor the fairest day its showres, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
he iudged himselfe, right blest and happy in his children, to shew
perfection is not in mortalitie, the sequell shewes you the weaknesse
of our ioyes, and vncertaine hopes fixt to posteritie.</p>
               <p>His father was yet liuing, and participant in all his happinesse, but
regarding his owne great yeares and sonnes deseruings, conferred
the Royaltie and cares vpon Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose two younger
brothers knowing themselues by law of grace and nature, much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to Prince <hi>Skander.</hi> Yet their owne ambition and others assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinations,
begot great opinions of their merits, though grounded
vpon no other, then tyranny and pale Enuie: and neglecting the
names giuen them at their Baptisme, the faith of Christ, wherein
their famous Predecessours had stood, with constant valour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Martyrs, The profession they had seene their parents, elder
brother and kindred, yea, and themselues thither to apparantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
in. All these despised, <hi>Thre-beg</hi> Apostatizes, and turnes <hi>Turke,</hi>
embracing without their perswasions the abominations of <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
And <hi>Constandel-chawn</hi> flies to the <hi>Persian,</hi> both, by their Idolatry,
customes and modes of that Nation endeuoring to aduance his
thoughts, though thereby hee reuolted from his Sauiour. In whose
power it was, in this impietie, to haue sent him flaming to Hell, in
choaking Brimstone and other plagues of reuenge and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Constandel-chawn</hi> (as Fame goes of him) was actiue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious,
nature hauing sufficiently enricht him, with gifts vnworthy
such a Master. Yet some report, by casualtie of riding, or like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
his bodie in some sort became imperfect. Which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
quenched not, but rather inflamed his daring courage, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20350:43"/>
looking vpon the vertue and perfections of other mens minds
and bodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abbas</hi> (then ruling ouer <hi>Persia</hi>) offended with the Turkish inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,
resolues to beate them out of <hi>Samachand,</hi> to effect it, hee
makes <hi>Ally-chawn</hi> his Generall (a tried Warriour) and to encourage
<hi>Constandell,</hi> ioynes him in equall command with <hi>Ally-chawn</hi> the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,</hi>
the way to affront the <hi>Turkes,</hi> was through <hi>Georgia,</hi> which gaue
a fit occasion to the Apostate <hi>Georgians</hi> ancient practices. So that,
without reuealing his intended Treason to <hi>Ally-chawn</hi> or others in
his company, and brazen-faced, not fearing to behold his grieued
parents and friends by his Apostasie, he visits them, and to stop their
exclamations (which he saw ready against his Mahometanisme and
Circumcision) he begins to lay open his receiuings, creations, fauour,
wealth, and trust, amongst the <hi>Persians,</hi> his great command prouing
no lesse then he had cold them. What knew they, but hee did this to
secure his Countrey, who knew his heart, but hee that made it, to
whose rule he deuoted all his actions. And with such heathenish and
detested Oratory, this wretch so blazed himselfe, and in requitall,
instead of ioy and applauses, had no other language retaliated him,
saue teares, sighes, sad countenances, and strange feares in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
visages.</p>
               <p>All which moued him to such condolings, that in place of asking
pardon, requesting prayers, promising amends, and sympathizing
with their heartie dolours, he beseeches them, to leaue off wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, (those expressions being more pungent then Swords or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.)
And if any loue or pittie remained in them, to forgiue him,
who had vowed a satisfaction and preferment to each of them, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of their true affections (Hypocrite, Villaine, that only aymed at
their destruction, and vnwittingly in despight of his hellish purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)
sent them to receiue a Crowne of Martyrdome.</p>
               <p>But to make his Tragedie the cleerer, after some cessation of
their sorrowes, and to mitigate their ill opinions, hee earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites
them to a solemne Supper, where after great varietie of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
by his appointment,<note place="margin">The Georgian King, Prince &amp; Nobles mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> which succeeded at his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word

then continue memories of sad Catastrophies) might in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

               <p>So when he saw, they were immortall (vniustly made so by his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany)
without least shew of remorse or pietie, ere his parents, Prince

new Guards of <hi>Persians,</hi> in each fortified place, and where such wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he suddenly built some, and there bestowed Garrisons. After
which, to shew the modester <hi>Persians</hi> his integritie to Heathenisme,
he sacrilegiously ransacks the Temples or Houses of Christian De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion,
trampling vnder. foot (so farre as hee was able) all reliques

long, and famous battaile, in heat of which the two Generals, full of
spirit and resolution, fought hand to hand, without distraction, and
after equall hopes of victory, at length they parted, but not without
honourable characters of emulation and dexteritie. <hi>Constandel-chawn,</hi>
was wounded in the elbow, and <hi>Sicala's</hi> sonne in the thigh, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in this interim on both sides, expressing all wayes possible to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
conquest, which yet was anticipated by the nights darknesse
(the Moone, it seemes, vnwilling to patronize their bloud-shed) so
that the <hi>Turkes,</hi> first made retreat, and entred the Towne. Though
the report giues victory to the <hi>Persian</hi> (bought at a deere price and
worth little, when obtained.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Constandell,</hi> when he saw the <hi>Turkes</hi> were entred <hi>Samac hand,</hi> giues
order that his wounded Souldiers should be cured, and resoluing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
to bid them battaile or besiege them, hee entrencht him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
pitching his owne and <hi>Ally-chawns</hi> Tent, one neere the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Georgians</hi> (he had forced to this battaile) though tired with
trauaile, and hurt in that dayes combate, sorrowfully remembring
the cruell murther of their aged King and good Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi>
inhumanely perpetrated by this <hi>Mahometan</hi> Monster, fearing his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
Tyrannies, and ioying little to be copartners with Infidels and
Agents of his base ambition: these and some other reasons swayed
them. That, not respecting his vsurped Title to the Crowne of
<hi>Georgia,</hi> his power with the <hi>Persian,</hi> the rigour of armes, forsuch
reuolts, vnanimously and with a faithfull courage, they assaulted the
fearelesse <hi>Persians,</hi> (that little dreamed of such Conspiracies) and
after some slaughter they came to the Generals Tents, who had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20350:44"/>
scaped thence, at first newes of this sedition, the <hi>Georgians,</hi> pulled
downe their new Kings Tent, and instead of <hi>Constandell</hi> (whom
they thirsted after) they cut in pieces a base Eunuch whom hee of

               <p>In this strange and vnexpected trouble <hi>Constandel-chawn</hi> to (whose

his father, brother and friends) after he had fled his Tent (in wonder
how this tumult tooke beginning, and by whose encouragements)
armed with amazement and nake dues, he followed after Ally-chawn,
his neighbour and copartner. Whom so soone as he espied, he threw
himselfe at his feet (supposing this combustion came from his inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
either to murther him, or at best, to manifest how little he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
his ambitions) &amp; crying out with a lowd and hideous voice,
exclaimes against cursed Fortune, who when hee thought himselfe,
most free from danger, and in the next degree to securitie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
had bitterly cast him downe, and made him more abiect,
then in his former beings before he had massacred, his dearest friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to become aduanced. And if that <hi>Ally-chawn</hi> desired his ruine, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested
him with earnestnesse, his death might be giuen him, by such
a Heroicke hand as his, rather then perish by the rascall multitude,
whose enuie and rage he knew, both insufferable and without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
Especially that his <hi>Georgians</hi> (whom by this time, hee saw were
principall against him) might not bragge hereafter, of their fortune,
and daring resolutions to cut off him their Soueraigne.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Ally-chawn,</hi> who at first, thought this rebellion, began from
<hi>Constandel,</hi> when he saw it otherwise, his feare and amazement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
greater, and insensible how to qualifie these bloudle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>,
and seeing the fire and noise grow higher, nothing but clangor and
out-cries possessing both sence and Tents. Hee embraces halfe-dead
<hi>Constandel,</hi> assures him of his innocencie and ignorance, bids him to
take courage, and conuocate the <hi>Persian</hi> Horsemen, and without
more inquisition to poste away a little further from the <hi>Turke,</hi> who
doubtlesse had he knowne of this conspiracie, had entred with them
and routed them vtterly.</p>
               <p>The two Generals hauing giuen signall to their Captaines when
and where to follow them, vpon two swift <hi>Arabian</hi> coursers fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
the night and disguised habit furthering their priuie parting,
where being some miles distant, the ablest of their army followed
them. The reuengfull <hi>Georgians</hi> also another way, retyring into
<hi>Georgia,</hi> displacing such Garrisons of <hi>Persians</hi> as <hi>Constandell</hi> had sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
there, and by each way fortifying all places of resistance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage,
assured of asecond entry of the <hi>Persian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed, this opinion, did not any whit deceiue them, for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standel-chawn</hi>
when he had recouered the rest of his distracted army,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20350:45"/>
animating them with all reasons possible to prouoke reuenge, vpon
these weake and treacherous <hi>Georgians,</hi> rebels to the Law of Armes
and Traitors in a high degree to him their Soueraigne. He protested
to receiue none into mercy, his former indulgence of a father, should
now perfectly conuert it selfe into desire of vtter extirpation and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie,
or rather Iustice, that the <hi>Persians</hi> may see his faith and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie
towards them, and all the World be witnesses of iust and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
retribution, to them his faithlesse and mad-brained slaues
and vassals.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persians,</hi> wisely conceiuing, their former losses, weaknesses
and remote beings, and that <hi>Constandels</hi> late Parricides, were incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,
able not only to prouoke loyall Subiects to reuenge (and
hauing indeed another King, <hi>Temeriscus,</hi> sonne of <hi>Alexander</hi>) but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
strangers, in way of pitie, and to diuert like miseries from their
owne Nations, they were more addicted homewards, and had retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
quietly, had not <hi>Ally-chawns</hi> perswasion altered them. Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bribed or by great imprecations conjured by <hi>Constandel</hi> to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
them, at last they consented to goe, if but to regaine their late
lost honours, and that the <hi>Georgian</hi> valour might not seeme too ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</p>
               <p>Glad of this resolution was <hi>Constandel,</hi> and no lesse glad, to see
them ingaged in the Quarrell of their reputation, by this, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to refeat himselfe, and make aduantage of the forfeitures of their
weake inheritances. So to giue more vigour to this action, he, giues
out great words against the <hi>Georgians,</hi> desiring the <hi>Persians</hi> to enrich
themselues with the spoiles, of goods or beauties, that they may see
how truly he labours to content and satisfie them to the full.</p>
               <p>In this manner proceedes this imperious <hi>Constandel,</hi> daring to
trample on his Sires ashes, and reioycing how hee should see his
Country in consuming flames, with a hideous massacre of man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and childe (but Almighty God who is the Ancient of dayes
whose arme is neuer shortned, nor power vnable, or vnwilling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

so soone, as they arriued neere to <hi>Georgia,</hi> was affronted by the
Queene, (wife of late murdered <hi>Alexander,</hi> eldest brother vnto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standel)</hi>
and being a Lady of faithfull memory to her destroyed hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
a very good Christian of great wit and courage, and much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
of her people, she rather chose to sacrifice her selfe (if that
would be sufficient) then see the downfall of the <hi>Georgians</hi> her
Countrimen.) So couragiously entring the <hi>Persian</hi> army, discloses who
she is, and as an Ambassadour required the sacred Law of Nations, to
speake freely and returne to the King her sonne without distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
which granted her, shee desires a parlee with her brother
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20350:45"/>
                  <hi>Constandel,</hi> that hearing of her being there, issued forth in brauery
and shew of insolence, demanding her businesse.</p>
               <p>This poore Lady, after some signes of sorrow and respect vnto his
person, beginnes to reprehend him mildly, sets before him, his late
murthers, how odious they were to all the Christians (and as she
belieued) vnto Infidels. What could he expect, when he had ruined
his countrimen, burnt all their trees and Cities, hee might easily
know the <hi>Persians</hi> vsed him for their owne aduantagious attempts,
and that he should neuer be without the brand of Traitour and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide,
that as yet, the meanes was open to redeeme the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his subiects, which he must looke to doe, if euer hee would be
famous to fight against them, or secure to defend his owne: say they
had offended him, yet no vertue more deified a Prince then Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
and in some measure they deserued mercy, the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their beloued Princes slaine by him and vndeseruingly, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
their choler, and that it might be his owne case, which fidelitie
(no doubt) would please his soule, though in other ioyes, and
with the immortall, hee knew the <hi>Georgians</hi> could neuer bee van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht,
without infinite murther, the valour of one <hi>Georgian,</hi> equall
to contend with fiue <hi>Persians,</hi> the very <hi>Mameluckes, Ianizaries,</hi> and
chiefe Commanders of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>India</hi> now being <hi>Georgians:</hi> and
who doubtlesse would beare reuenge in their hearts, if he should be
so cruell to their Kindred. Shee beseeched him (if hee could not be
disswaded) to condiscend thus farre, that they two might next day
meet, conueniently betwixt both Armies: where after discourse,
they would referre peace or warre vnto his iudgement.</p>
               <p>This parley ended, proud <hi>Constandell,</hi> after some notions of pride
and haughtinesse, bids her rest confident of his resolutions, that, as
Nature had graced him with the dignitie of being eldest (his brothers
being murdred) and the safetie of <hi>Georgia</hi> depended vpon the care
and fame of such a person as he reputed himselfe, hee would, after
some chastisement of his Rebels, take vpon him the defence and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of that Kingdome, and for <hi>Temeriske</hi> their supposed King
(her sonne) hee should not want preferment, either the inheritance
of <hi>Mengrellia,</hi> (a forced right) <hi>Charsee</hi> or some such Dukedome,
should giue him satisfaction, in the extreame of his desires or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
his infancie and doubt of legitimation, secluding him a while,
from enioying any Soueraigntie: and that his deserts and right might
appeare, perfect in view of all men, he accepted of her motion, and
would with twenty horsemen meete her, in an appointed place
twixt both the Armies, where his Title and plea of right and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
should defend it selfe, aswell in conference, as battaile.</p>
               <p>This granted, after two dayes respire, according to the Articles,
<hi>Constandel-chawn</hi> and the Queene of <hi>Georgia</hi> met, at the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed:

(in whose Court he was educated, and liued much honoured and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

the vtmost of his rage, was sure of small thankes from <hi>Abbas</hi> King of

opinion of his valour and knowledge in Armes, so that they were
desirous to entertaine him as their Gouernour. By his expertnesse
encouraging them to a defence against the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> both
whom in all occasions were insulting ouer them, because indefensiue
and without gouernment, And that she had faithfully spoke, what
she desired, though it was in great part against the dignitie and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of <hi>Temeriske</hi> her sonne, as then in <hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereto, <hi>Constandel-chawn,</hi> beyond measure efflated with pride
and high opinions of his worth and conquests (iudging his being
their, no lesse) replyed in few words. That he was fearelesse of his
establishment in his Fathers Royalties, That amongst such haughtie
and perfidious people, he had rather come in as a Conquerour, then
by right of succession, that himselfe and his good friends the <hi>Persians</hi>
had suffered in their honour so exceedingly, that without battaile
and bloud they could not part well satisfied, that hee had his Army
in Battalia; and resolued to execute, that (notwithstanding hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the <hi>Georgians</hi> ready to receiue them in sury) he doubted not
to massacre the best of them. For as hee had incorporated himselfe
vnto another people in Religion, speech, order and action, and such
as loued him, he would neuer trust his owne Countrimen, who had
with such peaceable faces so lately betrayed him, and whom hee
knew, irreconcileable, and so assured her, in a word, hee sought re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
and murther, not excepting the innocents.</p>
               <p>At which the Heroicke Queene, sighed, and shooke her Iauelin
(saying, if it will be no better, then God destroy the Homicide) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
vpon that signe hee was shot to the heart, and sunke downe
dead, with a wrathfull countenance,<note place="margin">Duke Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del Slaine by an Ambushment.</note> as only grieuing hee perished in
this base sort, without recompence. At sight of which, the Queene,
and the ambushed Musquetiers (hid of purpose to destroy him) forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

with retired to their Army, who expected the euent, and receiued
her ioyfully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ally, chawn,</hi> when he knew, <hi>Constandell</hi> was slaine: was cooled in
a further reuenge, only that the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> might not impute
cowardize or treason to him, hee speedily affronted the <hi>Georgians,</hi>
who receiued him in warlike sort, with such furie and hast pressing
on the <hi>Persians,</hi> that they desired to come off without more venture,
and so after losse of some common Souldiers retired home, leauing
the <hi>Georgians</hi> Victors, though defensiues, who without delay, slue
all such Garrisons of <hi>Persians,</hi> as eclypsed them, and by all industry
of men and monies, made strong all such places of defence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
as might defend themselues, and offend their enemies.</p>
               <p>So soone as <hi>Ally-chawn</hi> returnes, he acquaints the King his Master.
In what had hapned. He was no stranger to the <hi>Georgian</hi> humours,
he knew well, tyranny was of all things, most odious to generous
dispositions, and that mens bodies might, but neuer the minds of the
<hi>Georgians</hi> be subiugated by violence, or deceitfull manners. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he studies how to pacifie and draw them to him, he knew poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
was of more force then power, hee assured himselfe, so ancient a
Nation required a Prince of their owne beliefe and temper, he knew
<hi>Temeriscus</hi> was he, and thereupon encourages his progresse, affords
him many Complements of Wel-wishes and Alliance, clothes him
sumptuously, returnes him all the ornaments of Right and Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
were taken from his Predessours, and guarded with a traine of
<hi>Coozel-bashawes,</hi> sends him home securely, where many thousands of
his people thronged to see him, ioying and enioying his wished com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
And <hi>Temeriske</hi> to denotate himselfe a thankfull person, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites
with many fauours such <hi>Persians</hi> as accompanied him, &amp; sends
old <hi>Abbas</hi> word of his welcomes and inthronization.</p>
               <p>Now see how mischiefe appeares in a louely and vndistempered
Scene, when all <hi>Asia</hi> celebrated this reconcilement, and none could
fasten vpon any colour of futured discontentment.</p>
               <p>An Ambassadour of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> arriues at <hi>Spawhawn,</hi> and
there vnder pretext of other imployments, by all priuate subtiltie,
labours to annihilate this late made Friendship, being very preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
to the Turkish Empire: so that he first sends secretly to yong
<hi>Temeriske</hi> and by his <hi>Sinon,</hi> possesses him, the <hi>Persian</hi> would neuer
digest their late ouerthrow neere to <hi>Armenia,</hi> and that <hi>Ally-chawn</hi> had
a promise of being <hi>Visier,</hi> or Lieutenant of those Countries for the
<hi>Persian,</hi> who resolued to make it a Prouince and to extirpate the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of a Kingdome. As he had done to <hi>Larr, Shushan, Babylon, Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cania,
Candahor, Hery</hi> and other Kingdomes, to the preiudice of their
honour, and apparant ruine of Christian Religion.</p>
               <p>This inueighing discourse, so preuailed, with credulous youthfull
<hi>Temeriske,</hi> that he resolues to defend himselfe, the maintenance of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20350:47"/>
his true beliefe, life, honour and freedome. The lesse fearing them.
In regard the <hi>Turkes</hi> had sworne to helpe them vpon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>Now when the politicke Ambassadour, had wrought Prince
<hi>Temeriske,</hi> as he desired, he then perswades with <hi>Abbas,</hi> that the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orgians</hi>
hated him, that their King had entertained discourse with the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and sought but an aduantage to betray his trust, that
if his words seemed of no moment, the matter was not consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and his employment carried him, to other ends then forreigne
Obiects.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Persia,</hi> sayes but little. Imagining the more, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
euer iealous and apt for each suspition, apprehends it fully, and
though he knew the Ambassadour hated their agreement, and would
reioyce to see them disunited, yet to rest confident of <hi>Temerisks</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
and fidelitie, and that the <hi>Turke</hi> might see his errour, he sends
his <hi>Elchee</hi> (or Ambassadour into <hi>Georgia,</hi> and by him entreats Prince
<hi>Temeriske</hi> to come and visit him.</p>
               <p>The Ambassadour found Royall welcome, but all his asseuerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and desires could not draw <hi>Temeriske</hi> to visit <hi>Persia,</hi> he sends ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses,
but those so weake and vnwelcome, that <hi>Abbas</hi> in no small
choler, sweares his destruction, repenting that he had heartned him
with too much clemencie (a vertue very rare in this old <hi>Abbas)</hi> &amp; sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for <hi>Aliculibeg, Iolla-beg</hi> &amp; other Captains, with a potent Army he
inuades <hi>Georgia,</hi> where finding small resistance, he gaue leaue to his
needy Army, to destroy and make all vse and meane of benefit,
where ere they trauelled, so that they fired their Villages sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
profaned their Churches, defloured their Virgins, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
all such villany, as lawlesse and barbarous enemies most hunt
after: and hauing enricht their Treasurie, satiated Reuenge, and
fortified some defensiue places, the victorious <hi>Persians</hi> returne, crosse
ouer <hi>Taurus,</hi> and leaue their King at <hi>Farabaut</hi> at the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, till
more imployment.</p>
               <p>In this wretched time, <hi>Temeriske</hi> fled to the <hi>Turke,</hi> who readily
receiued him and assures him of re-establishment, this granted, that
he would protest an inuiolable league with them against the <hi>Persian.</hi>
To which the distressed <hi>Georgian</hi> assents, and accompanied with a
mightie Army of <hi>Turkes</hi> and his owne Nation, re-enters <hi>Georgia,</hi>
in a battle, beats the enemy, and by a foolish pride and securitie of
the <hi>Persian</hi> Deputy, defeats their best and ablest forces killing the
Deputy, and recouering what formerly they had beene put from,
and finding all things so well ordered the <hi>Turkes</hi> returne some vnto
<hi>Teflis,</hi> the rest to other places.</p>
               <p>The newes of this came presently to <hi>Abbas</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and as
Fame increases in its progresse, so without question, the <hi>Georgian</hi>
outrage was aggrauated to the height, by some, that hated them.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20350:47"/>
He was as a man distracted, his sweet ease and effeminate sports in
<hi>Mozendram,</hi> so one way swayed him, and point of Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
the other way prouoked him. At last, after a volly of impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
against them, for snatching him from his golden quiet and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations,
flaming with crueltie, he sends for his Generals, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
them leuie a mightie Army, vowing the vtter distruction of
these <hi>Georgians,</hi> and attiring himselfe in red, his Tulipant, Cabbay,
Boots, Scabberd, and other furniture (as signals of bloud and horror)
In hastie marches he enters King <hi>Temeriskes</hi> vnhappy Country (who
hearing of the mighty Army and vndoubted threats of the King of
<hi>Persia</hi> had with all his friends and ablest men, conueighed away their
Plate and Iewels, retired into some protecting places of the <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> Countries, not daring to oppose the huge Army of their
Aduersaries at that instant.)</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> with like liberty to offend and spoyle, slue all the aged
and infant <hi>Georgians</hi> they could meet withall: violated the chaste
Matrones, regarded no age nor sexe, committed all possible villanie
in the Churches, vtterly defaced and spoiled their Groues and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

trees, and wholy destroyed their profitable Silke-wormes and many
such like out-rages, in so high a nature as could be effected by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenge
or tumult, and full gorged with bloud and bootie, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Georgians</hi> and <hi>Temeriske</hi> their sorrowing King, thought this
a staine vnto their Honour, but policie and discretion warranted
them, that they might afterward be euen with the <hi>Persian,</hi> when least

to fight with or famish all his Garrisons, and hauing obtained a

homewards, in all places finding nothing but signes of desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ruling with more fame and splendour then he had done before.</p>
               <p>And in some measure became euen, with some of their heauiest
enemies, by asubtle deuice of <hi>Morad-chawn</hi> a Duke of <hi>Georgia,</hi> who

               <p>This Citie is distant from <hi>Shiras</hi> two hundred and odde miles,

               <p>The <hi>Hummums</hi> here are round, spacious and costly, one of which
built by this King, cost fifteene thousand pound sterling, ere it was
finished, they are much giuen to bath, and it is most of their Physick,
it is preualent too against the <hi>lues venerea,</hi> and that disease not a little
infects the lustfull. The men goe in the afternoone, the women at
morne, and guided by the Eunuches.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moscheas,</hi> or Churches are large and handsome, that at the
West side of the <hi>Mydan</hi> is most beautifull, tis round built with good
white Marble fiue yards high from the Sole, the rest is dried Bricks,
coloured ouer with Posies of <hi>Arabique</hi> and like worke.</p>
               <p>In the midst is a <hi>Tancke</hi> of water, with which they purifie their
hands and eyes, when they prepare to prayer: they performe their
Orisons kneeling, and ducking frequently. They turne their faces
towards <hi>Mecha.</hi> Neere which at <hi>Talnabi</hi> rests the bones of their great
<hi>Mohomet.</hi>
               </p>

thirtie are brasse, the rest of Iron, and are Culuerins. These were
brought from <hi>Ormus</hi> or <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the North end of the <hi>Mydan,</hi> is eight or nine roomes, like
Chappels hung with Lampes, which being many and cleare, giue a
dainty splendour; hither sometimes the King repaires, and sees the
Sodomiticall Boyes and Wenches dance, and sport together, and
when he is away, the people haue them.</p>
               <p>At the furthest end, North of the <hi>Mydan,</hi> is the Kings Mint,
wherein all forreigne Coines are new stampt, with the <hi>Persian</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.
One day is for money, a second for Gold, a third for Brasse,
besides this he hath fourteene other Mints, at <hi>Larr, Shiras, Babylon,
Tauris, Cazbeen, Candahor,</hi> and other Cities.</p>
               <p>The Gardens fall in the next place, to bee spoken of, and in
this, this Citie enioyes many both large and delightfull; I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my selfe to speake of one, by which you may coniecture of the
rest.</p>
               <p>Tis at the Southwest end of the Citie, to which you passe through
a street of two miles length and better, both sides planted with
<hi>Chenor</hi>-trees.</p>
               <p>The Garden is called <hi>Nazar-iareeb,</hi> tis a thousand paces from North
to South, and seuen hundred broad. It hath varieties of fruites and
pleasant trees, and is watered with a streame cut through the <hi>Coroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Mountaine, and is forceably brought hither, the first walke is set
with pipes of Lead and Brasse, through which the water is vrged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
giues varietie of pleasure.</p>
               <p>From the entrance to the further end, is one continued open al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
diuided into nine ascents, each mounting higher by a foot then
other, the space twixt each ascent, is smooth and pleasant. In the
midst is a faire <hi>Tancke</hi> or pond of water, of twelue equall angles and
rowes set with pipes to spout the water.</p>
               <p>At the entrance is a little (but wel-built) house of pleasure, the
lower roomes adorned with Chrystall water, immured with <hi>Tancks</hi>
of rich white Marble.</p>
               <p>The Chambers aboue, are enricht with pictures, representing
sports, hawking, fishing, archery, wrastling, &amp;c. other places in vse
very richly ore-laid with Gold and Azure.</p>
               <p>But that which is of most commendation is the prospect it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyes,
for by being seated so high, it ore-tops and giues the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
view of a great part of the Citie, which cannot be obtained
else-where.</p>
               <p>Returning to the Citie you passe ouer a Bridge, archt and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with fiue and thirtie Pillars, vnder which is a streame of water,

               <p>This Artaxerzes was that <hi>Ahashuerus,</hi> who married <hi>Hester,</hi> the

               <p>In <hi>Spawhawn</hi> (at our being there) were two Couents of <hi>Spanish</hi>

               <p>We had guides and a Conuoy to direct vs, the Starres were theirs,
without whose ayme there is no certaintie. The Sunne is so fiery

night to <hi>Whomg</hi> seuen and twentie miles, and next to <hi>Tawgebawt,</hi> a
House and Garden of the Kings, giuing place to few in <hi>Parthia.</hi> The
house is small in compasse, not affoording aboue a dozen Chambers,
but the Ornament is Gold, enameled and pargeted very daintily: the
Garden is North from the House yet ioyning to it, it has six seuerall
discents, each part giuing eightie paces, &amp; seuentie broad, tis watered
by a cleare riuolet (tho litle) by whose vertue it abounds in Damaske
Roses and other flowres, plentie of broad spreading <hi>Chenor</hi>-trees
(which is like our Beech) with Pomegranats, Peaches, Apricockes,
Plummes, Apples, Peares, Chesnuts and Cherries. It has Ecchoes,
naturall Grottoes and Labyrinths, made by art and nature. It enioyes
a Hot-house well built and paued with white Marble, and these are
the rarer, because they are seated and walled about, in a large euen
Plaine, rich in nothing but Salt and Sand.</p>
               <p>Hence wee rode to <hi>Bawt,</hi> (which signifies a Garden too) next in
<hi>Obigarmy,</hi> both these are Houses belonging to the King, who twixt

               <p>This nights trauaile was bettered by <hi>Cynthia's</hi> candor, and behoof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
because wee trauelled through a miserable inhospitable wilde
Desert of Sand,<note place="margin">A sandy Desart.</note> ten miles broad, and the length ten times so much.
The sands by the fury of Tempests lies in great drifts, like moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
so light and vnstable, that the high wayes are neuer certaine,
whereby passengers are oft inuolued and ouer-turned, they and their
Camels, and so perish in the mercilesse sands; to preuent which dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
(as much as can be) the King causes euery three miles a Castle to

yearely torne asunder in peece-meale, and no signe left of their once

               <p>That night we rode thirtie miles, and next night to <hi>Suffedaw</hi> one
and twentie miles, next to <hi>Siacow,</hi> wherein is a Carrauans-raw of
white free stone, and the first building of that materiall, I saw in those
parts of <hi>Parthia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That night we rode thirtie miles, most of which was ouer a broad

nothing but Salt (not vnlike pure Snow) where note that the
whole Wildernesse is so deepe and boggie,<note place="margin">A Salt Desart.</note> that Horse, Camell, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant,
if they goe from the Causey are plunged and buried in the
Salt and Bogge, yea, many out of curiositie and ignorance haue pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht

the passage, no way but backe vpon the same Causey shewing way
for flight or defence, and so soone as wee had past securely the Salt
Desart, we rode ouer, and about hils so high and glomerating, as if
<hi>Olympus</hi> had beene cut into <hi>Dedalian</hi> Labyrinths.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Siacow,</hi> we rode next night ouer another salt and vast De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart,
the ground of like danger and trouble, in which many thousands
haue also perished, and would yet be lost, had not the King caused a
like large and deepe grounded Causey be built for their securitie,
this nights iourney was two and twenty miles.</p>
               <p>Whence next night vnto <hi>Gezz</hi> a Lodge of the Kings, eighteene
miles distant from our last dayes rest, which moonlight night, we rode
through the bottomes of transected <hi>Taurus,</hi> whose stupendious fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
wets it selfe within the Airy middle Region. The lane or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
is fortie yards wide, the hils on either side towring as I haue
spoken of, the inhabitants say that <hi>Mortis Haly</hi> (their renowned
Prophet) cut this marualous passage with his slycing Semiter, that
his people might passe more easily.</p>
               <p>How false soeuer that be, this is certaine, that twelue yeares past,
a very valiant and famous Thiefe, with fiue hundred horse and three
hundred shot, was Lord of this straight, and receiued tribute from
all passengers.</p>
               <p>This aggrated the <hi>Persian</hi> King exceedingly to be so bearded,<note place="margin">A famous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian turnes Mahometan, and is slaine.</note> and
proposed a great reward and honour to any that could vanquish him.

               <p>The <hi>Armenian</hi> returnes to the Court with victory, had his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

                  <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and was made a <hi>Sultan,</hi> but see the vengeance pursuing
him (for who can be secure without a Sauiour) he continued happie
in many fights and imployments against the <hi>Tartar,</hi> yet the iealous

our being here, by secret warning from the Emperour, by <hi>Lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la-beg,</hi>
had his head cut off, and felt a terrible reward for his Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,

               <p>
                  <hi>ASharaffe</hi> or <hi>Ahasuraffe,</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> is in
the latitude of thirtie eight degrees seuenteene minutes, and
full North from <hi>Spawhawn,</hi> as the Pole-starre (which is of a
third magnitude, in the tip of the little Beares taile) assured vs; this
Citie is distant from <hi>Spawhawn</hi> three hundred and thirty <hi>English</hi>
miles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hyrcania</hi> is now called <hi>Mozendram,</hi> is limited on the North with
the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, on the South with Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> hath <hi>Zagathia</hi> on
the East (which is part of <hi>Scythia intra Imaum</hi>) and to the West
<hi>Media,</hi> or rather some part of the lesser <hi>Armenia,</hi> vpon whose tops
the Arke rested. The Countrey is full of Woods, amongst which
are Oakes, though the people vse them little on the <hi>Hyrcan</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Araxis,</hi> from the <hi>Taurisian</hi> Mountaines, (as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> writes from
<hi>Sagapene, Colthyan</hi> and <hi>Seducaene</hi>) waters and fattens this peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Countrey, to perfect which, shee is diuided and sub-diuided
so oft and into so many streames and Riuolets, that from an ample
Riuer, ere she kisse the <hi>Caspian,</hi> she loseth her pride and giues leaue
to wade through her deepest channell.</p>
               <p>The Country of old, and yet abounds with Tygres, according to
the Poets Songs, <hi>Hyrcanaeque admorunt vbera Tygres,</hi> whose like
companions, are Wolues, Lions, Wild-cats, Bores, and Scorpions,
amongst which rabble may be cataloguized, the swarmes of Gnats,
Flies and Snakes, that pestered vs to our wofull remembrances.</p>
               <p>By some, this Kingdome, has beene called <hi>Corca,</hi> by others <hi>Girgia</hi>
(meaning perhaps <hi>Georgia,</hi> which is <hi>Iberia,</hi> twixt the two Seas) some
againe <hi>Caspia, Steana,</hi> and <hi>Diurgument,</hi> which Titles, as questionlesse
they haue beene subiect to inuention, so the errour is not great, since
we are sure it is old <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> knowne with trouble to the victorious
<hi>Macedohian Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The people are ciuilized (as say the <hi>Persians</hi>) since they haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Abbas</hi> their Conquerour. Their Country is vsefull for passage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Tartarie</hi> and <hi>Turcomania,</hi> and therefore has endured no small
troubles to defend its right. Tis pleasant and rich, and therefore
a bait to allure her Sun-burnt and famisht Neighbours to extenuate
her plentie.</p>
               <p>The people of old,<note place="margin">Alexander the Great.</note> thought to forbid <hi>Achilles</hi> successor his desired
entrance, by twisting one tree to another, forcing the vnwilling
boughes to bad subiection.</p>
               <p>But hee that had dissected <hi>Gordions</hi> knot, though very mysticall,

               <p>The Countrie is (as I haue said) full of Wood, which, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friends
them against Winter colds, and shades them from the parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sunne, both which in their seasons are there extreame; in those
Woods lurke sauage creatures, Leopards, Tygres, Wolues, Foxes,
Apes, Antilopes, Red and Fallow Deere and such like, but in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
number and offence, swarme of Gnats and Flies, and stinging
Scorpions: they are small in bulk, but fierce in their venemous dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
he that is stung if he escape death, is frantique twentie houres
at least: and no better remedy then (like <hi>Achilles</hi> Speare) to turne a
Scorpion into Oile,<note place="margin">Remedie against Scorpions.</note> and apply it to the place offended. The <hi>Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
thinke to preuent their poyson, by Charmes which they tie
about their armes, yet it sometimes failes them, and then the cause
is there that dayes sinne, themselues excusing it.</p>
               <p>The prime Cities of this Kingdome are <hi>Farrabaut, Asharaffe, Peris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,

from <hi>Muscouia,</hi> emptie themselues into this <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, which
though turbulent, wee saw neither ebs nor flowes (yet neuer ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowes)
and has no commerce or entercourse with any Sea, except
(as is credible) it be subterranean, into the Euxine: and is lesse won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull,
remembring the floud <hi>Zioberis,</hi> which arising out of <hi>Taurus,</hi>
hides it selfe thirtie miles vnder ground and opens it selfe againe, and
mixes with another Riuer in that Countrey called <hi>Rhodago,</hi> both
which run into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea. And Tradition tels vs that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
<hi>Alezander</hi> to find the truth of this report, made two Oxen be
throwne into <hi>Zioberis,</hi> who were seene to rise againe at <hi>Rhodago.</hi>
The like is reported of the Riuer <hi>Niger</hi> in <hi>Afrique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea is in compasse neere three thousand miles, tis from
North to South, seuen hundred and odde miles, and from East to

by reason of the water which stands so long ouer it) with Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley

               <p>The people speake the Language of <hi>Persia,</hi> their apparell like the
<hi>Irish</hi> Trooses, their heads haue a high woollen Cap, furred with
their sheep-skins. They are affable, and delight in nouelties.</p>
               <p>Howbeit the <hi>Persians,</hi> if one may beleeue them, report merrie
stories of these <hi>Hyrcanians,</hi> making the men brutish and the women
vnchast, that they are very faire and amiable (which we credit, finding
so) and so kind and louing vnto Trauellers, that vpon any signall,

<hi>Asharaffe,</hi> the King sent a <hi>Coozel-bash</hi> to him, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
and that next day he would giue him Audience,
accordingly next day, which was our Sabbath, and with them a day
of Ceremonie, being the first day of their great Fast and Feast (for

doe both excessiuely) this Feast is called <hi>Ramazan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ramdam, is their Lent, and Byram their Easter.</note>

our Ambassadour, with Sir <hi>Robert Sherley,</hi> and seuen or eight
<hi>English</hi> Gentlemen his followers, set forwards to the Court: and
this I remember our Ambassadour tooke it ill, none came to vsher
him, or shew the way. For that morning hauing sent to <hi>Mahomet

whom our Ambassadour scorning, sent backe, and so procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with his owne Company.</p>
               <p>At our alighting at the Court gate, an Officer led vs in to a little
place, hauing a prettie Marble Pond or <hi>Tancke</hi> in Centre. The rest
spread with silke Carpets, where our Ambassadour and the rest stayed

two houres, and then were feasted with a dish of <hi>Pelo,</hi> which is
Rice boyled with Hens, Mutton, Butter, Almonds and Turmerack:
but how meane soeuer the diet was, the furniture was excellent, pure
beaten gold, both dishes, couers, flaggons, cups and the rest.</p>
               <p>Thence we were led by many <hi>Sultans,</hi> through a large, delicate,
and odoriferous Garden, to a house of pleasure, whose Chambers
both viewed the tops of <hi>Taurus</hi> and the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>Into this Lodge we entred, the low-roome was round and spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the ground spread with silke Carpets, in the midst a Marble
<hi>Tancke</hi> full of Chrystaline water (an Element of no small account in
those Torrid habitations) and round about the <hi>Tancke,</hi> vessels of pure
Gold, some fild with wine, others with sweet smelling flowres.</p>

with three times more vessels of Gold, set there for pompe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation.</p>
               <p>At the end sate the <hi>Potshaugh</hi> or great King, crosse-legged, and
mounted a little higher then the rest, his seat hauing two or three
white silke shags vpon the Carpets.</p>
               <p>His attire was very ordinary, his Tulipant, could not out-value
fortie shillings, his coat red Callico quilted with Cotton, worth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little, his sword hung in a leather belt, its handle or hilt was gold,
and in regard the King was so plaine attired, most of the Court, had
like apparell on for that day.</p>
               <p>Yet the Plate and Iewels in that House argued against pouertie, a
Merchant then there, imagined it worth twenie millions of pounds.</p>
               <p>So soone as our Lord Ambassadour came to him, hee by his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
deliuered briefly, the cause of his iourney which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
his victorious successe against the <hi>Turke,</hi> to renue the Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
of Silke, and other things to benefit the Merchants, and to see
Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> purge himselfe from those imputations laid on
him by <hi>Nogdibeg</hi> the King of <hi>Persia</hi> his late Ambassadour.</p>
               <p>The King gaue him a very gracious reply, and whereas he thinkes
it honour enough to let the great <hi>Turkes</hi> Ambassadour kisse the hem
of his Coat, and sometimes his Foot, he very nobly gaue our Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
his Hand, and with it puld him downe and seated him next to
him crosse-legged, and calling for a cup off wine drunke to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
our famous King, at which he put of his Hat, and the King see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, put off his Turbant, and drunke the cup off, which our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
pledged thankfully. And the people thought it a strange
thing to see their King so complementall, fortis a shame with them
to be bare-headed.</p>
               <p>The Chamber wherein he was entertained, had the sides painted
and gilded very beautifully, though indeed the Verse may be inuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>Materia superabat opus,</hi> and not <hi>materiam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Round about, with there backs to the wall, were seated fiftie or

sixtie <hi>Beglerbegs, Sultans</hi> and <hi>Chawns,</hi> who sit like so many Statues,
rather then liuing men. The <hi>Ganymed</hi> Boyes goe vp and downe with
flaggons of wine, and fill to those that couet it.</p>
               <p>The day before this Ceremony, the King rode to hunt the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre,
accompanied only with two hundred Women, his Wiues and
Concubines, most of them were attired like couragious <hi>Amazons,</hi>
with Semiter, Bow and Arrowes, the Eunuchs riding abroad to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
any to come in view of them, the penaltie is no lesse then losse
of life, a deare price for Nouelties.</p>
               <p>And though for the most part, when the King is in a Progresse,
he has sometimes ten thousand, other times twentie thousand <hi>Cozel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashawes,</hi>
or Souldiers of best reckoning, yet at our being then at
Court, two thousand was the most, then attending him.</p>
               <p>I will relate his seuere iustice, acted at our being in <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> a
poore man who had trauelled from <hi>Cabull</hi> in <hi>India</hi> a place though
belonging to the <hi>Mogol,</hi> yet <hi>Candahor</hi> and much of <hi>Arachosia</hi> conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it, is wonne from them by the <hi>Persian</hi>) this poore man after so
long a iourney, got to the Court, and the weather being very sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous,
affected rather the grasse to sleepe on then the Towne, tis
so pestered with Musketoes, Flyes and other vermine, his businesse
was not much, yet had better, beene none at all.</p>
               <p>It was his ill fate, to be a sleepe, as old <hi>Abbas</hi> was going a hunting
within the path, the King saw him not, but his pamperd horse start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at him, whereat immediatly the King sent a broad Arrow into the
poore mans heart, and ere all his followers had past, the man was
kild a hundred times ouer, if so many Arrowes could haue forfeited
so many liues, in imitating the King, as if the deed were good and
commendable.</p>
               <p>A Souldiers Wife abounding with more Lust then Loue, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
to the King, her Husband did not satisfie her, whereat hee
makes her be coupled to an <hi>Asinego,</hi> whose villany and lust tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
her life.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Cozel-bash</hi> here presented him a Petition,<note place="margin">The Kings crueltie.</note> the writing did not
please him, he sends for the Clarke, cuts off his hand, and made the
Petitioner be almost drubd to death.</p>
               <p>Two needie Knaues were brought afore him, and condemned for
stealing.</p>
               <p>The King threatned them more for being ragged and lousie, there
by to disgrace his Court, then for the theft. And that they might die
neatlier then they liued, he causes new Coates to be put vpon them,
and forthwith commanded they should be carried out of Towne
and impaled vpon two stakes, thrust through their fundaments.</p>
               <p>He has other tortures, as poysons, strangling with bow-strings,
men-eating Dogs (some of which the Merchants or Sea-men bring
out of <hi>England,</hi> and sell there) and men from their infancie educated
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20350:56"/>
to Canibalisme, with many other tortures rather beseeming a blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
Tyrant, then so famous a King.</p>
               <p>A Duke who is his Vice-roy for <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> seeing a Boy, whose
Father was poore (and vnder his command) against the Boyes will,
his parents knowledge and the Law of Nature, makes him a Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
(which crying sinne, though licensed by their Alcoran, yet
force is not to be vsed, and therefore haue <hi>Ganymeds</hi> in each great
Citie tolerated) the Father of this wronged child prostrates himselfe
before the King, and acquaints him with that villany, the King see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sorrow and truth in the Peasants looke, demands of the Duke,
who then was sitting there, how true it was: his countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayes
him. The King hauing at that instant, a Knife in his hand,
giues it the poore Father and bids him Eunuchize him, punishing
those parts, that had offended. The Duke durst not startle or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
the Law of the <hi>Persian,</hi> neuer alters the poore man, executes, as
was enioyned him. The King though, continues his iurisdiction to
him, and has him yet, his obedient slaue or seruant. His <hi>Seraglio</hi> only
lost most by that bargaine.</p>
               <p>The King by a <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Lady (which Countri-woman the <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon</hi>
his mother also was, wife to <hi>Mahomet</hi>) had two sonnes, <hi>Ismaell</hi>
and another, <hi>Mirza. Ismaell</hi> died, hauing not attained twenty yeares,
and the yonger brother by right and law of birth and Nations then
became heire apparant to his dignitie and expectations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shaw Abbas</hi> his Father by his other Paramours had many children,
but this <hi>Mirza</hi> as endued with the prerogatiues of yeares and birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
preuailed more in his Fathers affection, and the establishment
of succession, then the other children, obtained by his affabilitie (a
vertue of especiall lustre and value with the <hi>Persian</hi>) courage, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
experience in Armes and other Princely Qualities requisite for
the place he liued in, the sonne of such a father, and the report hee
aimed at, to beget loue and admiration amongst his friends, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
with his enemies. Whereby hee got leaue at sundry times, to
command his Fathers ready Armies, men apt for action, and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
satisfied, then when employed, either to enrich themselues by
spoile or other aduantages of Warre and Fortune, and by whose skill
and his owne valour, he much enlarged the <hi>Persian</hi> Territories, and
got somewhat from the <hi>Mogull</hi> towards <hi>Candahor,</hi> from the <hi>Arabian</hi>
neere to <hi>Balsora,</hi> and the <hi>Tartar</hi> East of the <hi>Hyrcanian</hi> Sea. So that
this <hi>Mirzaes</hi> prowesse and good lucke became newes of ioy and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to the <hi>Persian</hi> and their enemies. His friends from secret wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wishes
breake out into acclamations of prayses and extreme Desarts,
and in peculiar fancies eleuated him. Some commend his person,
some his excellencie and delight in armes, others his eloquence and
all his liberalitie and care. In a word they esteemed him without
comparison, and left nothing vnsaid or vndone that could adde ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20350:57"/>
honour or contentment to him, who for all this (not like our
common spirits, who vpon small aduancement or other attributes
deifie themselues and suppose all such additions tributary, and vnder
their deseruings) stood immoueable, and sorry they accounted him
so worthy, in modestie blaming them for doubling his merits, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
himselfe of hypocrisie and neglect, to suffer his Acts to be so
gilded, and least hee might eclypse the King his Father either in his
splendour or content.</p>
               <p>And to say truth, his popularitie begot iealousie and contempt in
the King his Father, who out of his suspitious nature, grounded on
Tyrannie, his feare of the <hi>Mirzaes</hi> ambitious designes, the inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of the <hi>Persians,</hi> and irritations of some Cabinet Counsellours (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
to the Prince) about him, beganne to feare him and desirous
(though his sonne) to haue him strangled, thus we see how cruell iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
is, more cruell then the Graue, and the bloud-thirstie dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating
of Tyrants and cruell men from grace, who as they are by
Gods Soueraigne pleasure seated in more eminencie then others, to
defend and relieue the distrest and wel-deseruing, turne it into pride
and crueltie, diuiding mercie and iustice who delight each other, and
such appeares in this old <hi>Abbas,</hi> that so farre forgot repentance, for
murthering his eldest brother <hi>Emir-hamze-mirza,</hi> a Prince so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
valiant, victorious, and each way worthy, that though the
<hi>Turkes</hi> (whose scourge he euer was like another <hi>Scanderbeg)</hi> reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at it, yet it drew flouds of teares and incessant lamentations from
the <hi>Persians,</hi> for the vntimely and treacherous downfall, of such a
hopefull, beautifull, and delightfull Cedar, and in memory of whom
(being all and the vtmost reuenge they durst to expiate) they solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
his Funerals with annuall teares, and for many yeares excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
hated his Fratricide <hi>Abbas,</hi> then ruling ouer them and who
by all acts of conquest against their aduersaries, and indulgence for
their safeties laboured his ingratiating into their loue, and by a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
deploring what had beene perpetrated, at length obtained it:
the thought of this, and posting his pur-blind Father into Paradice,
in time forgotten, especially seeing they enioyed their seuerall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
in like sort as anciently, and that by <hi>Shaugh Abbas</hi> his victories
against the <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> they became redoubted and feared in
most of <hi>Asia.</hi> So that for many yeares hee gouerned fortunate and
iustly, beloued and honoured, and neuer at a higher pitch attained
it, then now, crowning his hostile employments by the victory and
brauery of his sonne the admired <hi>Mirza</hi> (himselfe tumbling in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
pleasures and varietie of delights.)</p>
               <p>The Prince in some attempts into <hi>Arabia,</hi> heard of, saw, admired,
and after some reciprocall fauours, espouses an <hi>Arabian</hi> Princesse to
his Wife, a Ladie (if report of a <hi>Persian</hi> man of note, be worth the
crediting) endowed with such gifts and ornaments of minde, birth,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20350:57"/>
beautie and loyaltie, as parelleld the best their liuing, and enstiled
the possessor rich and happy. And the rather, because without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
in the quarrelsome opinions of the King his father.</p>
               <p>By this Lady he had two children, <hi>Soffie</hi> and <hi>Fatyma:</hi> both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of, by Parents and Grandsire, and pleasing to the <hi>Persians,</hi>
who honour the issue of such as descend from Ancestors of courage,
high birth, beautie and the like, all which flowed into these two
Princes.</p>
               <p>All terrene ioyes are mixt with discontent and periods, and old
<hi>Abbas,</hi> day by day increasing his iealousie and enuie to his sonne,
intends to hinder his further progresse into glory or other happines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he durst not banish him, least hee should conuert his rage, to affront
his vnnaturall Father, and when he thought of killing him by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in his Army (the innocent Prince at that time, sweating in bloud
to redeeme the honour of his Countrimen against the <hi>Turke</hi>) that
frighted him, lest when his cruelty disclosed it selfe, vpon apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the murderer, his men in reuenge and detestation of his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
might rebell, or ioyning with the enemie, to his irreparable
losse of purse and honour. So that he resolued to execute him at the
Court, when farre from friends and where he could best faine an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented
crime, so without more procrastinations, he sends a shooter
or footman to him, and (all excuses set aside) to post to Court:
where the businesse should then be told him.</p>
               <p>The Prince, to forfet their amazement and ill opinion of him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
the message and assures them of his flying speed thither and
backe againe, and without more ceremonie hastens to receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of thankes, destruction.</p>
               <p>His arriuall was quickly knowne to his father <hi>Abbas,</hi> who sends
him word he was not very well, and desired him to repose where
they should carry him, and ere long hee would come and welcome
him.</p>
               <p>The credulous Prince, without any suspect of treachery (inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
signes of honestie and a sincere mind) followes the man appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to shew his lodging, whereinto, (so soone as that seruant was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted)
enters at a trap-doore, seuen great Villaines, deafe and
dumbe, armed with Bow-strings and bloudie minds, whose habit and
weapons without other Interpreters, assured the amazed Prince
that he was betrayed, and sealed to destruction. If oratorie or other
submissiue signes of entreatie could haue begot pitie or intermission
from these hel-hounds, but only till he knew the cause of this vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
proiect, he had affoorded it, but knowing they were deafe in
bodie and soule, inflamed with rage and sorrow, that hee wanted a
Sword or other Weapon to defend himselfe, hee flew vpon them
all, one after another, offending them by rare force and agilitie, a
long time preuenting the noozes to fasten on him, which they threw
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20350:58"/>
incessantly towards his necke, presenting pale death in their terrible
twangs, and armed with integritie and innocence, ere they could
strangle him, he sent three of them to the Deuill, to receiue their
recompence, the other foure seeing their danger, re-enforced their
actions, and at last fastned on him, who quite spent with rage and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals,
fell downe dead, and as crauing a cessation of that horrible
fight, and that they would not equallize him in the manner of his
death, to abiect Dogs. But these Canibals continued their cruell
cowardize both dead and liuing, and had surely finisht their villany,
had not the King then entred and preuented them (who some say,
was a secret spectator of this vnparalleld barbarisme) hee forthwith,
commands his tired armes to be pinnioned, and ere he had fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
his sences, makes a hot flaming steele be drawne afore his
eyes, which though giuing no great paine, yet tooke away his eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight:
forbidding him for euer any more sight of what hee loued,
wife, children, friends, and endeared Souldiers. And by this exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
impietie, <hi>Asia</hi> lost her chiefest Iewell, <hi>Mars</hi> his Darling, and
<hi>Persia</hi> her incomparable treasure, now vndone, blind, imprisoned,
and hopelesse of any ioy or honour euer after.</p>
               <p>This could not be so secretly committed, but in time, all <hi>Persia</hi>
knew it, and lamented it with teares for him, and imprecations of
all mischiefe vpon the Authours of it: his Army were of long time
implacable, but when they saw it was past remedie, and the King
would in time, serue them with like sawce, if they continued refra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie,
they retired, and buried in murmure and forced silence, what
their hearts fully and freely discourst vpon.</p>
               <p>So soone as the blinded Prince, perceiued himselfe imprisoned
(which hee saw with the eyes of griefe and vnderstanding) hee was
more then half-distracted, exclaimed vpon his bloudie father, curst
his birth-day, and vowed the Kings destruction and his Fauourites,
if it lay in his power to see or touch them: but when he cald to mind
his impossible desires, he roared hideously, and in a word, exprest all
true symptomes of madnesse and desire of reuenge, till his afflicted
Kinsmen and companions, flockt about him, and dictated patience:
which they bettered, by relating their owne <hi>quondam</hi> greatnesse in
bloud and offices, till by the like dislike and mutabilitie of <hi>Shaw Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi>
his humours, they were digraded, trod vpon, mutilated, some
their eyes put out, some their eares and noses cut off, and others in
other members, here captiued and almost famished.</p>
               <p>In those discontented times, the King mouing like <hi>Saturne</hi> in the
highest Orbe, deliciously tooke his pleasure, and on all sides stood
free and firme against stormes or other accidentall causes, able to
withstand his quiet.</p>
               <p>He surfeited in varietie of pleasures, but none tooke him so much
as the beautie and pretie discourse he obserued in <hi>Fatyma</hi> (daughter
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20350:58"/>
to his blinded and enraged sonne) which Ladie, though not seuen
yeares old, in such sort inchanted doting <hi>Abbas,</hi> that nothing rellisht
well without <hi>Fatyma,</hi> none gaue him mirth, saue <hi>Fatyma,</hi> and if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
against any, no better reconcilement then by <hi>Fatyma,</hi> so that
Court and Kingdome wondred at his loue to this wittie Ladie his
beloued grand-child, whom when aged two yeares more, he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a marriage with an <hi>Arabian</hi> King.</p>
               <p>Nor had King <hi>Abbas</hi> all the benefit of this little Lady, for though
she had all possible delight and pleasure at the Court: yet neglected
she no part of dutie, but came very oft into the Cittadell to ioy her
father and releeue his wants; for that none saue shee, durst aske the
King for their allowances, without apparant danger of displeasure
and life withall, if it hapned he was displeased, though in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whereby the royall (but most miserable) prisoners at sometimes
were neere famished, none daring to releeue them, lest the iealous
King might haue them in suspition.</p>
               <p>Thus by this good Lady gained they what formerly they pined
for, euen food and comfort. But as the Deuill is neuer fild with villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
bloud, or horrour, so he exasperates this blinded Prince her father
to a strange reuenge (sonne of a father both vnnaturall) for thirsting
after it though neuer so terrible, in a Deuillish apprehension, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his fathers immoderate ioy and pleasure hee tooke in <hi>Fatyma,</hi>
whom too (reuenge excepted which whirld him headlong to perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
he affected exceedingly the law of Nature, (for wee name not
grace in these Catastrophes) her infinite deseruings, as loded with
admirable beautie, a delicate spirit, sweet behauiour and charitable
acts surpassing child-hood, forced him to conceiue well of her, and
wish he had some meanes to be reuenged, but this word reuenge he
still harpt vpon: it was his food, rayment, sleepe and chiefe delight,
for all the rest were comprehended in bloud-thirstinesse. Which
wicked designe at length he accomplishes, for one time when his sad
Wife and sonne were sitting by him, prettie <hi>Fatyma</hi> came in with
reliefe vnto her father, and by all actions of loue and dutie to shew
her selfe obedient, such time (cursed time) as this young Princesse
plaid about him, the Prince called her, who readily came to be made
much of, but see a horred entertainment, for in stead of loue and
kindnesse, with admirable celeritie and rage, grasping her tender
necke with his strong and wrathfull hands, whirli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dead vpon the floore his daughter <hi>Fatyma,</hi> and in her the ioy of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
excessiue delight of the aged King, and sole ornament and
comfort of all that Kingdome: the poore Princesse strugled and
cried out against him, that it was <hi>Fatyma,</hi> little thinking, hee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
kild her, because <hi>Fatyma.</hi> But hee hearing his sonne <hi>Soffie</hi> was
there too, in blind sort pursued him, who to his good fortune escape
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:20350:59"/>
downe staires, and some yeares after at his Grand-sires death, was
crowned King of <hi>Persia</hi> at our comming thence.</p>
               <p>So soone as old King <hi>Abbas</hi> heard of this sad accident, hee fell into
such passions of rage and sorrow, that each man feared he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his owne Executioner: and though many pittied him and
were sorry for the cause, yet none durst comfort hm, fearing his
impatient nature, but left it to time and the Kings owne courage and
prouidence to mitigate his dolours.</p>
               <p>Yet, to expresse how ill he tooke so foule a murther (hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
masquing his former cruelties) sends threats of terrible satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions,
as famine, strapadoes and other punishments to the inraged
Prince his Sonne. Who, by the Messinger retuned his father many
curses, hopes of better reuenge and wishes of ten thousand mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
to fall vpon him, and in this cholloricke and melancholy
temper he spent two sad dayes, and in the third gaue a period to
his miseries in this World, by supping a delighted cup of extreame
poyson, and when his death was told the King, he commanded some
Noble men to see him buried, but not where harmelesse <hi>Fatyma</hi>
was entombed.</p>
               <p>The sad Princesse his wife, surfeiting with sorrow and discontent
mewed her selfe vp, and since that time has seldome beene seene to
any, so that the certaintie of her life is doubtfull vnto many. Except
now her sonne <hi>Soffie-Shaw,</hi> (succeeding his royall Grandsire <hi>Abbas,</hi>
in the <hi>Persian</hi> dignitie, and crowned at our comming thence) hath
since disswaded her from that solitary and vnfitting life, and to afford

where is a Castle so built, vpon the best aduantages of art and nature
that it seemes inuincible; aboue, it wants no ground for benefit and

in a Riuolet of pure water, which pleasantly and plentifully

               <p>In this place, fiue and twenty yeares agoe ruled a King <hi>Meleck Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haman</hi>

yet such was his good fortune, his policie, valour and loue vnto his

secure, and liued to see the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

His only ayme tending to preserue, what his Predecessours
had made him heire to, and that his gray haires might goe in peace
to an eternall Dormitory.</p>
               <p>Thus thought <hi>Bahaman,</hi> and added his endeuours to preserue his
thoughts. But <hi>Abbas</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> and victorious King, whose resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were all for conquest, whose doings were euer turbulent, and
whose aspiring conceits most wonderfull: In his returne from the
conquest of <hi>Mozendram</hi> (or <hi>Hyrcania</hi>) which he got by perswasion
more then force, and by helpe of his <hi>Herians</hi> and <hi>Ouz-beg Tartars,</hi>
resolues to be no longer bearded by this mountaynous Prince, who
from his dwellings could not only view farre into either Kingdomes
<hi>Mozendram</hi> and <hi>Sheirvan,</hi> but thereby tooke opportunitie to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacke
his Carrauans, anticipate his progresse to the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, and
turne those Riuers into other sources, which springing from the
<hi>Taurisian</hi> Hils, flowed through the <hi>Persian</hi> Territories, and was the
sole delight and wealth of all those Kingdomes.</p>
               <p>Now though these reasons were coniecturall, in that hee neuer
knew Prince <hi>Bahaman</hi> a deceitfull or grating Neighbour, yet <hi>Abbas</hi>
playd the Wolfe, who drinking at the Fountain-head, quarrels with
the harmeles Lambe for quenching his flagrant thirst at the streame
below. And impatient of longer tryall, conuocates a great Army of
<hi>Timariots</hi> and <hi>Coozel-bashaes,</hi> ouer whom hee appoints <hi>Methiculi-Chawn</hi>
and some other expert Warriours, to see his designes succeed
with good hap and victory ouer those defenced Nations.</p>
               <p>This could not be so secretly entended, but aged <hi>Bahaman</hi> heares
of his aymes and prouisions, at which though somewhat terrified.
In that his great yeares were more propense to ease then tumult,
yet that his faithfull people might not in any thing receiue discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
or cowardize from his example, whose interest and honour
was most, and most engaged: hee prouides as a common father for
them, and performes each act, requisite in a carefull and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Souldier.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:20350:61"/>
Hee plants Garrisons in places of defence and seruice, leaues na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and destitute of all helpe his Countrey, lest the <hi>Persian</hi> Armie
might prey vpon it, and mewes himselfe, his Wife, two sonnes and
ten thousand men in this aforenamed Castle, stored with prouision
and victuals, sufficient for a fiue yeares siege against the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> Generall with thirtie thousand men, hasten towards
<hi>Taurus,</hi> where at their first ascent, they were troubled by some
Mountayners, set their purposely by King <hi>Bahaman,</hi> these with
Darts, and rowling stones vpon them, for some time endamaged
the <hi>Persian,</hi> but could not preuent their resolued passages: and after
some small skirmishes, encampt themselues before this Castle, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
heard by some prisoners, that <hi>Melech Bahaman,</hi> the two Princes
and force of all the Kingdome was there included.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Methiculi-beg,</hi> when he had well viewed this inaccessible Fortresse,
halfe despayred of subduing him, for besides the strength of men
and wals, he saw it was impregnable, such was the great height of the
Castle and the perpendicular ascent, two mayne defences wherewith
nature and industry had graced it.</p>
               <p>Some attempts he vsed but inualidable; to shoot Darts or Arrowes
at it, was one with ayming at the Moone. Some small shot they had,
but too weake to penetrate Rockes, and great Ordnance (which
only was auailable) they had not, wherewith either to affright or
batter them.</p>
               <p>So after many tedious brauadoes (wherein the <hi>Persian</hi> receiued
stones for their arrogancy) the Generall (not daring to returne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the victory) finding force nor patience of any value, turnes <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauillian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He summons them aboue to parley with him, which being granted
by his Herald he presents him many protestations of loue and desire
of friendship, that his Warre was grounded only to satisfie <hi>Shaw
Abbas,</hi> who had sworne to be reuenged vpon them, for offering in
old times some hostile affronts vnto poore passengers, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
his conuerting the Riuers other wayes then hee enjoyed them,
that seeing his surmises were without true ground or reason, hee
saw no obstacle, that ought to forbid a new league of peace and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and to strengthen his Ambassage, that it might shadow truth, and
beget beliefe the readier, presents the aged King with Tulipants, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miters,
Pearles and some other inticing Iewels, withall entreates
him to come downe and taste a Banquet, swearing by <hi>Mortis Ally</hi> and
King <hi>Abbas</hi> heads, by Paradice and the eight Orbes, that he should
returne in safety, and he most desired it, that some Articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might ensue their parley.</p>
               <p>The King (who euer affected peace) heares his messages, receiues
his presents, and becomes too credulous of the <hi>Persians</hi> honestie, his
Wife and Sonnes disswade him from it, tell him examples of their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20350:62"/>
hypocrisie, and by many wayes seeke to diuert his iourney, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
those, nor the teares his Souldiers showred to begge his stay,
(vowing to mayntayne the defence, to the last man) could hinder
his destiny, but downe he goes, and finds the Generall ready to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
him, leads him to his Tent, bestowes a Banquet on him, and
at night imprisons him, regarding neither his vow, honour, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Meleck Bahaman,</hi> perceiues the losse of his liberty when past re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery,
rememorizes his sonnes aduice and teares shed by his loyall
subiects to diuert him, which now hee resents and tearmes Elegiac.</p>
               <p>And in these fruitlesse sorrowes, the <hi>Persian</hi> Generall summons
the youthfull Princes to descend, if they respected the addition of
new honours to themselues, a period to this warre, and (which was
most) security and life to their indulgent King and Father, all which
by discord, and denying to come downe would be denied them,
be an infallible Theame of endlesse troubles, and beget an eternall
monument of shame to their posterity.</p>
               <p>The two Princes considerately first demanded their imprisoned
father, and then they might worthily credit the <hi>Persian,</hi> otherwise
he might iudge them, worse then Ideots, the villany and breach of
promise towards their Soueraigne, being so true and fresh amongst
them. They might aswell desire the Castle and other Royalties, as
demand the Owners of them, and by whom subsisting, other answer
they would make none, this excepted, that the King of <hi>Persiaes</hi> ill-grounded
ambition would neuer prosper, that though of long time
he had politely auoided the Epethite of a Tyrant. This would rub a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
his former injustice and anatomize him, so cleerely, that all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
would not only suspect him, but account him odious, that all men
might see apparantly his auarice, who commanding ouer many and
fruitfull Prouinces, could not be contented, without subjugating a
Nation, neuer wronging him, a King whose Ante-cessours had for
more ages gouerned <hi>Larry Ioon.</hi> Then the posterity of <hi>Ismael</hi> had
done <hi>Persia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and a Countrey so cold and barren, that more then title,
the <hi>Persian</hi> could not make any vse of nor benefit of addition, saue
ostentation.</p>
               <p>When these words were rehearsed to the Generall, hee was mad
with anger, and (without more Ceremony) inuites them from their
Castle, to view their Fathers head off. They resolutely bid him doe
as pleased him, and remember, that murther was not excused in their
Alcoran.</p>
               <p>This enraged the Generall more then the former, verily imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
they would yeeld to any thing rather then the slaughter of
their King and Father.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, he againe in vtmost rage and fury assaulted them, and
for a recompence of his haste receiued, besides the losse of many
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20350:62"/>
                  <hi>Cozel-bashes,</hi> a plaine protest from his men, of returning homewards,
arguing that they had got the Countrey, that <hi>Shaw Abbas</hi> with more
benefit and credit could imploy them against the <hi>Turke</hi> or <hi>Indian,</hi>
that <hi>Meleck</hi> was with them, and by his perswasions might recouer it,
without battaile, as he had lately done <hi>Larr,</hi> at any time.</p>
               <p>The Generall by this was drawne into a twofold danger, if he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
from their humours, he knew all past was to no purpose, and
would inferre dishonour to his Master. On the other side, if hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
without victory, hee knew his head should off: so in great
anguish, he first releases <hi>Meleck Bahaman,</hi> assures him, hee vsed this
discourtesie but to try him, that if hee pleased hee should safely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
againe or stay with him, where he should possesse all content
and honour possible. That hee was sent for by the King: and had
order to compound this difference: he desired the Princes his sonnes
to descend and to articulate, or let him goe vp and their seale an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
but that he judged vnworthy his good meaning, who
thereby might be thought a Spy: with which discourse, the olde
King was so ouer-joyed, that he referd the choice vnto the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
which hapned as he aymed at, and so without delay desires the
Princes to come downe.</p>
               <p>A Messenger inuites them to it, assures them of King <hi>Bahamans</hi>
welfare, deliuers them his doting letters and perswasions: enterlaces
these with <hi>Piscashes</hi> or gifts of worth, and shewes them a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Copy of the easie Articles.</p>
               <p>The poore and wel-nigh distracted Princes, knew not what to do,
on the one side their refusall might cost the King his life, and irritate
the <hi>Persian</hi> to further mischiefe, on the other, their Discent, might
bring deceit, distraction and losse of life and liberty not only to the
King and Princes, but to all those loyall subjects pent aboue, and
who vndoubtedly after them must to the shambles.</p>
               <p>They argued long time too and fro, and though the Souldiers
disswaded them, yet the Queene, to enjoy her Husband prouoked
them downe. In obedience to whom, and confidence in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
oaths and promises, they sorrowfully forsake the Castle, and are
securely guarded to the Tents, where they feasted, and vpon sight of
their beloued Lord and Father, had noble entertainment from the
Generall.</p>
               <p>But when these three were blessing their good destiny, smiling
one vpon another, (the Generall then in company) at sight of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
token, three <hi>Cozel-hashawes</hi> standing by, in an instant whipt off
all their heads, with their slicing Shamsheers or Semiters, and ere it
was divulged abroad,<note place="margin">The King and two Princes treacherously murdered.</note> by counterfeit seales and signes, made them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue,
descend and yeeld the Castle, some of which receiued de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,

Soueraigntie, and yoakt in tyranny this late thought indomitable
Nation.</p>
               <p>Such was the end of <hi>Meleck Bahaman,</hi> and two hopefull Princes,
forgetfull of Warres stratagems, and how <hi>Aladules</hi> King of <hi>Anti-Taurus,</hi>
for playing fast and loose with <hi>Seylim</hi> the first Emperour of

though if we may credit <hi>Pius</hi> the Second, and other Writers of this
place, one pastue has heretofore nourisht fifty thousand Mares. They
write of the Oyle <hi>Medicum,</hi> which doubles its flame in water of
<hi>Naphta</hi> and some other Ceremonies. I will adde the description of
the Villages and Cities which haue beene badly done by some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne

               <p>The great Cities of <hi>Media,</hi> are <hi>Cazbeen, Tabris,</hi> or <hi>Tauris, Arda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil,

               <p>This City is built of white Sun-burnt brickes, is watered with a

               <p>
                  <hi>Mahomet</hi> by reason of some imperfections in his body was thought

and in these doubts, foure dayes after, by meanes of <hi>Zal</hi> or <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-chawn</hi>
Duke of <hi>Tyroan</hi> his faithfull friend, had his desires. The
Crowne once more was set vpon his head and he proclaimed King,
but he enioyed it not aboue two dayes, for when he least suspected,
his head was strucke off, by his Vncle <hi>Sahamal-chawn,</hi> and throwne
in great contempt vnto the people,<note place="margin">Prince Ayder slaine.</note> as a iust recompence, for his ill-grounded

               <p>The report of whose slaughter, came suddenly to <hi>Ismael</hi> his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who without more feares or ceremonies, accounted himselfe
no lesse then King led to it by his Father will, his sisters desires, and
the peoples expectations.</p>
               <p>But to omit nothing that might strengthen his hold, he comes to

Successors to <hi>Mahomet</hi> at <hi>Mecha</hi> (the only hatefull men vnto all <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>)

which report of his and others of like distast and sorrow to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

amongst whom his valiant sister <hi>Peria-con-Conna,</hi> confederating with

bloudy cruelties with his God <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whom he so fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
This hapned in <hi>Cazbeen</hi> the foure and twentieth of <hi>Nouember

               </p>
               <p>This Monster being taken away, <hi>Mahomet,</hi> by perswasion of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-mirza,</hi>
his deere friend, accepts the Empire, thereby annihilating

should without much noise enter the Citie, and by some meanes or
other, behead her, which accordingly he did and sent her head, with
the haire disheueld about her shoulders, vpon a Speares point, vnto
the King her brother, to the terrour and admiration of all men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially

               <p>The Prince from thence hastens to <hi>Sumachia,</hi> where he besieged

to yeeld next day, that night stole away not looking backe

               <p>But <hi>Sumachia</hi> for her rebellion and perfidie was set on fire, and

               <p>AFter some stay in <hi>Cazbeen,</hi> our Ambassadour, desirous of his
dispatch visited <hi>Mahomet-Aly-beg,</hi> and by him intreated an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
of his Letter.</p>
               <p>The Pagan in short told him, if hee had any more to possesse the
King he should first acquaint him, and consequently haue an answer,
to which our Ambassadour replyed little, tho discontented much,
perceiuing by this, he should haue no further accesse vnto the King,
but willing to be gone, and loth the Fauourite should see him dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
he trusted him with his businesse. Some part the continuation
of amity betwixt their Masters, with some words of the Merchants
Traffique, and an acknowledgment from the King, that Sir <hi>Robert
Sherley</hi> was his true Ambassadour into <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the two first <hi>Mahomet-Ally-beg</hi> vndesired, bolted out, that hee
knew his Master the King of <hi>Persia</hi> or <hi>Potshaw,</hi> stood more affected
to no one Prince of the World, then to our King: and that the
Trade and Exchange betwixt their Merchants, was both pleasing and
profitable to his King: and for Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> (whose enemy
<hi>Mahomet</hi> euer has) he knew and had heard the King himselfe say, he
cared not for him, and that his Ambassies and Messages to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Christendome, were friuolous and forged, tis true, quoth hee,
the King gaue him (as an argument of fauour) at the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, a
Horse and Garment, but it was more to satisfie the other Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
himselfe, then out of any respect the King had vnto him.</p>
               <p>And when our Lord Ambassadour told him, Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> had
the Kings Letter of Credence or <hi>Firman,</hi> to testifie the truth of it,
and thats if he were an Imposture, he were the veriest Foole liuing,
to vndertake a iourney of that length and danger, knowing with all
the Kings seuerity.</p>
               <p>To which the Pagan answered not, but told him, at their next
meeting he would giue him ampler satisfaction, intreating him for a
sight of Sir <hi>Roberts</hi> Testimoniall Letter, and a Copy of what Sir
<hi>Robert Sherley</hi> had treated about in <hi>England,</hi> or other places.</p>
               <p>Two dayes after, attended by some Gentlemen, he visited <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met-Ally-beg</hi>
againe, and gaue him the Copy of what he last desired,
and with all shewed him, Sir <hi>Roberts</hi> Letter of Credence signed by
his King <hi>Shaw Abbas</hi> in <hi>Spahawn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He bid him looke vpon it, and tell him if it had the Image of a
Counterfeit, the malicious Fauourite thought it had, but being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine,
craued it to shew the King, which accordingly he did (if
we may giue credit to an enemy and Infidell) vnto the King three
dayes after, who (as he told Sir <hi>Dodmore Cotton</hi>) viewed them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20350:69"/>
them for true, and in rage had burnt them, wishing Sir <hi>Robert
Sherley</hi> to depart his kingdome, as old and troublesome.</p>
               <p>He was amazed at it, but knew no remedie.</p>
               <p>For my owne part I am verily perswaded, the Kings Seales and
<hi>Phirman</hi> were true, and that either <hi>Mahomet-Ally-beg</hi> jugled with
him (for wee had but his word, for all wee knew, and neuer more
came in presence of the King) he might forge other Letters to shew
the King, else why kept he them two dayes without deliuery, or he
might haue slandered the King, to say hee burnt them, being an act,
not worthy so iust a Prince as <hi>Abbas</hi> was reputed for.</p>
               <p>This argument may proue his being true Ambassadour, because the
King hearing he came in that defence, and to cleere his honour from
<hi>Nogdi-begs</hi> aspersions in <hi>England,</hi> as the King gaue him no apparant
satisfaction yet because he neuer questioned an injury done him (that
had he beene an Imposture had beene one) it followes he was guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with innocencie and truth.</p>
               <p>And but that <hi>Nogdi-beg</hi> had done Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> injury, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should <hi>Shaugh Abbas</hi> say, twas well for him hee poysoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
(guiltie of reuenge) for had hee come to the Court of <hi>Persia,</hi>
he would haue sliced his body into as many parts as there be dayes
in a yeare, and burnt them with Dogs Turds, in the open Market
place.</p>
               <p>Againe, his sonne in our company, durst not come at Court to
account for his vnluckie Father, till <hi>Zenall Chawn</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Tyroan</hi> his kinsman enterceded, and bribed for his peace and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.</p>
               <p>The truth is Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> had deserued well from the <hi>Persian,</hi>
but being old and vnable for further seruice, got this recompence, to
be slighted in his honour, euen then when he hoped for most thanks
and other acknoledgments.</p>

               <p>He was brother to two worthy Gentlemen Sir <hi>Anthonie</hi> and Sir
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:20350:69"/>
                  <hi>Thomas Sherleys,</hi> his age exceeded not the great Clymacterick, his
condition was free, noble, but inconstant. He was the greatest Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueller
in his time, and had tasted liberally of many great Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours:
of the Pope he had power to legitimate the <hi>Indians,</hi> and from
the Emperour receiued the Honour and Title of a Palatine of the
Empire. His patience was better then his intellect, he was not much
acquainted with the <hi>Muses,</hi> but what he wanted in Phylosophy, hee
supplyed in Languages. He had beene seruant to the <hi>Persian</hi> neere
thirty yeares, and merited much better then you see, he then obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
when he most expected it.</p>
               <p>Though, it may seeme impertinent, I cannot passe by in silence,
without iniury to her memory, whom I so much honoured, the
thrice worthy and vndanted Lady <hi>Terezia,</hi> his faithfull Wife, to this

pretending an Ingagement he was in, to one <hi>Crole</hi> a <hi>Flemming</hi> (for
some monies Sir <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> had long since borrowed of him)
he is beleeued, and got a Warrant from the <hi>Cawsee</hi> or Iustice to

but was knowne by a faithfull honest Gentleman Master <hi>Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
a Follower of our Ambassadour, who straight-way acquaints
the Lady with it, which as she knew was false, so seemed it strange,
yet recalling herselfe, she tore a Sattin Quilt with her feeble hands,
and trusted him with her treasure, a Cabinet, some Iewels, rich
stones and the like, with which hee was no sooner gone, when the
Pagan Serjants, with <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Flemming,</hi> entred her Chamber, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away what was valuable or vendible, his Horses, Camels, Vests,
Turbants, a rich <hi>Persian</hi> Dagger, and some other things, but after
narrow search finding no Iewels, (for they had seene him weare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and twas them, hee had woorried in his Ostrich appetite) mad,
angry and ashamed, they departed vnsatisfied.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman when the storme was past, re-deliuered her her
Jewels, of a double value now, cause of that conquest, which had
she wanted, I doe not thinke her fortunes left her would haue made
vp fifty pound, a small reuenue for so deseruing a Lady, and most
vsefull in those vncharitable Regions against Woman-kind, of whom
though much esteemed by the <hi>Persians,</hi> yet seeme rather, in those

residing there, who with their Priests assisted vs. His Horse

a large Bulke to maintaine, and no Camelion, his education being
simple, he became Costermonger, and by that became wealthy and
capable to maintaine himselfe.</p>
               <p>In a happy houre, the king (then in the <hi>Hippodrome,</hi> and in <hi>Spaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawn</hi>)
tooke notice of him, viewd him, lik't him and prefered him,
so as in small time he became sole Fauorite, and then was feared and

awfull complement sent him yearely some gift or other to cherish
his fauour, whereby his wealth became wonderfull.</p>
               <p>His presence was very good, a good and smiling countenance,

               <p>Other-some include <hi>Aegypt, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and say that the

Paradice remoued to a high mountaine aboue the middle Region,

               <p>The best opinion is this, that <hi>Nile</hi> nor <hi>Ganges</hi> had no being there,

diuides it selfe into foure branches. The first being <hi>Pison,</hi> which
compasseth the land of <hi>Hauilah,</hi> it must be a branch of <hi>Tygris</hi> called
<hi>Hiddekel,</hi> or else <hi>Choaspes</hi> which encircles <hi>Hauilah,</hi> which is <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is <hi>Gihon,</hi> which encompasseth <hi>Aethiopia</hi> or <hi>Cush, Gihon</hi>
is the West part of <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Cush</hi> not yet in <hi>Afrique</hi> is <hi>Susiana,</hi>
or <hi>Chushiana,</hi> as some Writers doe well denotate.</p>
               <p>And to make it easier, because many old Writers will haue <hi>Haui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi>

               <p>It remaynes now to speake of the habit and disposition of the
<hi>Persians.</hi> It is therefore first, to be noted that though the <hi>Turkes</hi> be
not comparable to the <hi>Persian</hi> for magnanimity and noblenesse of
mind, yet are the <hi>Persian</hi> from the Duke vnto the Peasant slaues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King, who is Supreme in and ouer all.</p>
               <p>Thats the reason, hauing so much good marble, they build with
vnburnt clay, because their lands and houses be not hereditary. The

King by a forced will, becomming Lord and heire to all, both <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,
Iewes</hi> and Christians liuing vnder his protection (merchants
excepted out of <hi>Europe.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are valiant, proper for the most part, Oliue-coloured, mirth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and venerious.</p>
               <p>They haue no haire on head nor chin, on the vpper-lip they haue
it very long and turned down-wards. Some reserue a locke vpon the
top of the head, as a certaine note that <hi>Mahomet</hi> at Doomes Day,
will distinguish them from Christians, and by it lift them vp to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radize:
their eyes are generally blacke (the <hi>Georgians</hi> grey) their
noses high as be their fore-heads.</p>
               <p>About their heads they winde great roules of Calico, some of
silke and gold, somewhat higher and not so bungy as the Turkish
Tulipants. A little fash of gold or fringe hangs downe behind, as
doe our Skarfes, which ornament, they lately borrowed from the
<hi>Arabian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bands are not amongst them, they are signes of peace and quiet,
the King weares the contrary side of his Tulipant forwards, which is
all the difference in habit, twixt him and others.</p>
               <p>In Triumphs I haue seene them wreath long chaines of Pearles
and Rubies about their Turbants, of great value and beautie.</p>
               <p>Their out Garment or Vest is commonly of Callico quilted with
Cotton, some weare them of parti-coloured silkes, some of Sattin
and some of rich gold or siluer Chamlets, and other of cloth of gold
and Tinselled: they affect varietie of colours as Emblemes of diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of Ioyes and pleasure. Blacke is not knowne among them, they
say tis dismall and a signe of hell and sorrow: their sleeues are strait
and long (therein different from the <hi>Turkes</hi> who haue them wide
and short) the coat reaches to their calues and beares round, by being
ingirted with a towell of silke and gold eight or nine yards long: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this garment they weare a smocke couloured like our Scottish
plad, and in length agreeing to our demi-shirts: their breeches are like
Irish troozes, hose and stockings sowed together, and sometimes
they reach but to the ancles, two or three inches naked to their
shooes which haue no latchets, are of good leather, and what colour
you will (blacke excepted) they are vsually sharpe at the toe, and
turning vpwards, the heeles shod with thin Iron, and end with small
nailes in seemely order. Some againe (especially such as trauell
much) haue short coats or calzoons of cloth without sleeues, lined
with Furres of <hi>Persian</hi> Sheepe, Sables, Foxes, Mushwhormaes or
Squirrils, and can suffer short wide stockings of English cloth or Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
the heeles faced with coloured leather which too when they
ride they make vse of, their Boots are well sewed, but ill cut, saue
that their widenesse beats off the showres. They vse no Gloues, nor

Rings of Gold, some paint their hands with an herbe or juice, which
colours and keepes coole the hands. They commonly haue their

not one noble Warriour of a thousand among them, knowing

               <p>They neuer goe without their Shamsheers or Swords, which are

               <p>They neuer ride without Bowes and Arrowes, the Quiuer and
Case, wrought and cut ingeniously, the Bowes are short and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

               <p>Their stature is meane but straight and comely, and incline rather
to corpulency then leannesse, their haire blacke and curling, their
fore-heads high and pure, eyes Diamond-like, hauing blacke lustre,
their noses high, mouthes rather large then sparing, thicke lips and
cheekes fat, round and painted, so that without errour, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions
cannot be deciphered: those that come in assemblies are best
reputed of, though by profession Whores, they are rich habilimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
their heads rounded with a golden caule: their cheekes tinctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with Vermillion, their noses and eares hung with Iewels of price
and bignesse, and about their faces (tied to the chin) a rope of orient
pearle of exceeding value, if not counterfeit: their hands are pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with flowres or posies, as be their feet and legs, both which are
denudated in their dances, which elaborately they performe with
bels and antiques: their habit or gowne is to their mid-legs, some of
Sattin, some of Tissued-stuffes, of rich imbrodery in gold or siluer,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20350:81"/>
these looke wantonly, drinke strongly, laugh extremely and couet

Eight or ten lustfull women, by the law subiected to one

pleasure, but not free from Eunuchs their iealous <hi>Argoes,</hi> whose sole

Other women when they goe abroad, wrap themselues in a large
receiuing sheet, which tyed to the head reaches to her feete, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
only to the eyes a very little to beget passage, they passe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
vnknowne and vnrespected: nothing lesse among them then
praise of beautie, because nothing so familiar with them as cruell
Iealousie.</p>
               <p>Their houses (to speake generally) within are poore and sordid,
a Carpet, a Pan, and a Platter, epitomizes all their Furniture,</p>
               <p>The better sort sleepe vpon Cots, or Beds two foot high, matted
or done with girth-web: on which a Shagg or Yopangee which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
serues as an Vmbrella against raine, and sleeping for a bed and
couerture.</p>
               <p>Those that haue slaues during (or rather to beget) rest, receiue
breath and coolnesse from their fanning them, who also driue away
those bold Muschetoes or Gnats which too turbulently sting and
buzze about them. Their diet is soone drest, soone eaten, soone di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
and soone described.</p>
               <p>The better sort sit vpon Carpets crosse-legged, and feed soundly
vpon <hi>Pelo,</hi> Chishmee-pelo, Sheere-pelo, Chelo and the like, that is,
Rice boiled with Butter, with Mutton, with Hens, with Almonds,
or with Rice without Butter: they vse no spoones, for hands are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienter:
some colour their Pelo blacke, some yellow, some white,
and twenty other wayes, which though all but Rice, are counted
so many seuerall dishes. But though the meat be particoloured, or
party named. Yet the ground and meate is Pelo and no other. They
vse Sallads Acharrs and rosted Egges, all which are of sundry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
tinctured, sad and hard that they may stay the longer in their
bellies, and strengthen heat and moysture in their stomackes. They
drinke cold water out of a Hussinee or Pitcher, but they want no
wine nor appetites to drinke it, a sure signe <hi>Bacchus</hi> once conquered
them, and rules no lesse then their Alcoran: at meales they are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and no way offensiue (if no women sit among them, who out of
wantonnesse ouer-load their mouthes with Pelo or other meat, and
by a sudden laughter exonerate their chaps, and throw the ouerplus
into the dish whence first they had it, which was to vs strange and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue)
they will be drunke, but it is voluntary, no man compels it.
Nor is it admirable or losse of credit with them, they are so quiet and
free from censure, &amp; though with vs drink irritates quarrels and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons,
yet here they neuer differ; the law is so seuere, the act so
strange, and the vnity of <hi>Mussulmen</hi> (or true beleeuers) so ioynt and

No Nation in the Vniuerse has better nor more daring spirits
in fight or exercise, then <hi>Persia</hi> has.</p>
               <p>They are very facetious in discourse, they are not very inquisitiue

stories to perplexe their mindes. When so ere they receiue a

Mortis Ally,</hi> the head of <hi>Mortis Ally,</hi> by <hi>Shawambashee</hi> or <hi>Serrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi>

then (if you please) you may beleeue them.</p>
               <p>The poore eat Rice sometimes, but most commonly Roots, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,
Fruits, Garlicke, Opium, Honey, and Fraize like to our Thlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery.
These are seldome drunke, but the cause is preualent, they

or Rice, both which are Epidemick in their mirth and Festiuals.</p>
               <p>The sheepe are sweete, and fattest in the taile, whose weight oft
ponderizes twenty pound, and many times their whole body. Cheese

precious diet: the Spoones to eat with are halfe a yard in length, and
aske a contented mouth to entertaine their bignesse.</p>
               <p>They hate Swines flesh, Veale, Beefe, Hares and Buffoles. <hi>Mahomet</hi>

they are no great Rost-meat-men. But it may be Ignorance
more then disliking has made it of some wonder there: In some
Buzzars they haue Camell or Mutton cut in mammocks or small
bits put vpon scuets and carbonaded or rosted in the fire, of this they
sell three or foure spits for two pence, some practize the art of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and to proue it, put a whole Lambe into an Ouen, without
paste or better cookery, when tis throughly tosted, though blacke,
they eat it and say it tasteth daintily. The truth is, they are all Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialists
and are not daintie.</p>
               <p>They vse another potion, faire water, juice of Lemmons, Sugar,
and Roses, which <hi>Sherbets</hi> are vsed more commonly in <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Twixt meales (which are three aday at eight, twelue, and foure)
they meet often in houses, like our Tauernes. Where is vendible
Wine, Arack, Sherbet, Tobacco suckt through water by long canes
or pipes, issuing from a boule or round vessell: they spit but seldome
(the <hi>Iewes</hi> lesse) and that liquour which most delights them, is Coffa
or Coho, a drinke brewed out of the <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake, blacke, thicke and
bitter; distrained from Berries of that quality, though thought good
and very wholsome, they say it expels melancholy, purges choler,
begets mirth, and an excellent concoction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Opium</hi> (of which <hi>Nogdibeg</hi> tooke so much as poysoned him) is of

giddies them, that in a constant dreame or dizzinesse, they run slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
not knowing whom they meet, and yet misse not their intended
places: and by its power protract their trauell, to deceiue their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

               <p>Their Coines are <hi>Mammoodees,</hi> which value eight pence, <hi>Larrees</hi>

Copper money is engrauen with the Emperours Coat Armour, a
Lion passant, gardant, the Sunne Orient vpon his backe.</p>
               <p>The men account it a great shame to vrine standing, and because

or diseases. Their mules are of great price and vertue, chiefly where
the iourney is ouer Sands, Desarts, or craggie Mountaines. They
serue better for patience and sure footing then the Horses, but in
Warres they are for baggage, wanting courage for more honourable

the <hi>Roman</hi> bondage, and though they seemed willing to
reiect them, yet scorned they so vnworthy a Commander, to effect it
be, being but lately from his prentiship, which <hi>Mahomet</hi> salued by his
ingenuitie, telling them of the manners of the <hi>Romans</hi> in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie,
and that though his knowledge and fame in Battailes were

Popery in abomination, &amp; though <hi>Mahomet</hi> be supreme of all,

they repute a great and holy Prophet, but not to be the Sonne of
God, or that hee died vpon the Crosse, but that it was another <hi>Iew</hi>

borne out of her beasts, In some things they speake very reuerently

of him, and punish seuerely, such as speake against him, so that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Alcoran stiles him the vertue of God, a powerfull Prophet
good and just, if they casually finde a piece of paper that has his

<hi>Persia,</hi> without a requested pardon, aswell demanded, In respect
of many that formerly haue named them, both <hi>Chaldee, Greeke</hi> and
<hi>Latine</hi> Writers, as for the incertainty of most Historians. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
to some it appeare not pleasant, not much profitable, it may

               <p>Their owne Traditions writ long agoe, and preserued hitherto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

rather beginne with <hi>Elam</hi> (from whom the people were called <hi>Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>

sonne of <hi>Noah.</hi> And if we may beleeue those Authours that suppose
this Patriarch <hi>Sem,</hi> was that <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> who blessed <hi>Abraham,</hi>
then may <hi>Kayomarraz</hi> be reputed <hi>Noah:</hi> but the Scripture tels vs that
<hi>Abram</hi> was in a lineall line from <hi>Sem,</hi> no lesse then ten Discents, and
though <hi>Noah</hi> himselfe, liued till the confusion of Languages at <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
(hapning a hundred and thirty yeares after the Floud) yet it is
not probable he was <hi>Melchisedecke,</hi> by that description of him in the

one holds him on his knee, another vnclothes him, a third holds fast
his hands, the rest giue some triuiall discourse to diminish the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation

trice with his siluer Cissers circumcises him, and applyes a healing
powder of Salt and Marmalate of Dates, which stanches the bloud
and mitigates his griefe, thence-forward hee is called <hi>Mussulman,</hi> or

               <p>After the death of some noble Gentleman,<note place="margin">The Authours sicknesse.</note> my course came next,
though not to die, yet to goe neere the Graue, whether the cause was
cold got vpon Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> where wee exposed our heated bodies
to vndigested vapours which easily penetrated vs, or rather our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
gormundizing their delicious fruits, which abounding we
affected in too great measure, these and Gods will first so ordered it,
that I begun a tedious sicknesse, in twelue dayes I had a thousand
bloudy stooles (which excesse kild our Lord Ambassadour Sir <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
Cotton</hi> at that time, and for forty dayes more, continued with
such cruelty, that neuer any man was brought lower and into grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
feeblenesse than I was.</p>
               <p>I wanted not the helpe and opinion of the Kings best Doctours,
who though they hoped of my recouery, gaue me small appearance
of it, yet I tooke what they prescribed mee, and gaue them Gold
what they desired, so that it became a hard question, whether my
spirits or Gold decayed faster.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:20350:91"/>
In this weaknesse, I was forced to trauell 300. miles, hanging vpon
a Camell, and when I most hoped for recouery, <hi>Morod</hi> their famous
<hi>Aesculapius,</hi> seeing no more money, limited my life to fiue dayes
more existence, It was the more terrible, cause hee had seene <hi>Mecha</hi>

               <p>But he that sits on high, and accounts all humane reason but meere
folly, in foure and twenty houres after proued this great Oraculizer
a compleat lier.</p>
               <p>For at that time, an old <hi>Tartarian Hecate</hi> my seruant to whom I
allowed eight pence daily, inuocated her <hi>Succubi</hi> to succour mee,
which not a little hurt me, by forcing me to raile and curse her O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons,
shee whether to hasten the Doctours sentence concerning
me, or rather to possesse my linnen (of which I had no small store)
aimed to poyson me, and shee knew strong drinke was vtterly forbid
me, for feare of inflammation, yet forced by inordinate thirst to call
for water, she returnes me old intoxicating <hi>Shiraz</hi> Wine, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly
I powred downe, and so immeasurably, it immediately ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
my vitall sences, and put mee for foure and twentie houres
into a deadly trance, so that it was a thousand to one, but it had kild
me: yet by Gods mercy after a virulent vomit and sleepe (which for
a moneth before I tasted not to any purpose) I recouered (in that
time once destinated to be buried by the Natiues, for few friends I
had to helpe me) but when they saw me liue, they both admired and
reioyced at it, so that by the binding qualitie of that wine and sleepe,
I became bound and in small time got strength and action; the olde
Whore in this season, opened my Trunckes (while my other seruant
sorrowed forme) tooke away my linnen and some moneys, and run
whether I neuer pursued her: this sicknesse hapned to mee, in my
age of one and twentie, which is one of the Clymactericks.</p>

On the thirteenth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> we set saile for other parts, when
being three or foure leagues at Sea, the winde came faire, so that on
the fifteenth day we were parallel to Saint <hi>Iohns,</hi> seuenty miles from
<hi>Swalley</hi> Road, on which day the expedition bearing vp to speak with
vs, the ships fell foule or thwart one another, whereby her bole-sprit
broke our mizen shrowdes, no more harme comming to either at
that time.</p>
               <p>The nineteenth of <hi>Aprill</hi> we made our selues <hi>Nadir</hi> to the Sunne,
which had Northerne declination fifteene degrees at which time we
sayled close by the Iland and Citie of <hi>Goa,</hi> the seate of the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
and Vice-roy of <hi>Portugall</hi> in the East <hi>Indies,</hi> this time being
becalmed and without winde, we had the weather exceeding sultry
and hot, our course lay still from <hi>Swalley</hi> Road all along the Coast of
<hi>India, Decan,</hi> and <hi>Malabar,</hi> South and South and by West, as farre as
the vtmost Cape of <hi>India,</hi> cald Cape de <hi>Comerin</hi> vnder seuen degrees
North, and all the way we failed close by the shore, hauing fourteene,
fifteene and sixteene fathome water.</p>
               <p>The three and twentieth of <hi>Aprill</hi> being Saint <hi>Georges</hi> day we sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
close by <hi>Mangalor,</hi> a Citie of the <hi>Mallabars,</hi> where were riding
thirty or forty Frigots <hi>Malabars</hi> men of warre, who all hoyst sayle
towards <hi>Goa,</hi> we steering contrary, only one Frigot came by chance
neere the <hi>Ionas,</hi> who sent her Barge after her, but she both rowing and
making large saile got away, howbeit the Barge once gaue her a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of small shot, but to small purpose.</p>
               <p>On the three and twentieth of <hi>Aprill</hi> wee came to an Anchor at
Mount <hi>Elly,</hi> or <hi>Delyn,</hi> a Towne belonging to the <hi>Malabars,</hi> and in
that Countrey, our Anchorage was nine fathomes, but at the shore
was only three.</p>
               <p>Wee durst not land, the people are so treacherous, and bloudy,
howbeit they came aboard vs in their small Canooes, and sold vs for
other trifles, Coco-nuts, Mangoes, lacks, greene Pepper, Carauan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or <hi>Indian</hi> Pease, Hens, Egges, and Buffols, which because rare
are deere. And for euery tun of fresh water, they demanded and
was payed a Royall of eight, or foure shillings and foure pence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bannians</hi> of these parts, as they liue in superstition, so they
affect Ceremony in their Burials. For according to the qualitie and
wealth of the deceased, such and so costly are their Funerals, aboue
those that be inferiour. Many sweet Gummes and Aromaticke O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
from <hi>Arabia,</hi> are incended and put in flames about the dead
body which is inuolued in linnen pure white, sweete and delicate,
or Taffataes of transparant finenesse: amongst other Wood<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

both rare and precious, they affect that cald <hi>Aquila</hi> and the older <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamba,</hi>
trees of admirable height &amp; euennesse, found most commonly
in the loftie Mountaine of <hi>Chaemoys,</hi> in <hi>Cochin-China,</hi> which those
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:20350:98"/>
people sell at excessiue rates, both in regard of the <hi>Bannian</hi> Obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies,
and esteeme, the Inhabitants of <hi>Iapan</hi> hold of it, imagining no
pillow wholsomer nor more efficatious for health then that to
sleepe vpon. For they extremely hate such as their heads may sinke
into, which, both heates the bloud and perturbes the fancie.</p>
               <p>And amongst other fruits as Orenges (which are sweet, succulent
and daintie) of so pleasant a taste and rellish, that they affect the eater
wonderfully offering the rinde with no lesse pleasure then the iuice,
both which seeme to haue dulcitie and Acrimony mixt together,
are Lemmons, Pappaes, Cocos, both sweete and great, Bananas or
Plantanes (the supposed fruit that <hi>Eue</hi> was temped with, and with
which <hi>Adam</hi> clothed himselfe to auoid the shame of nakednes) which
Tree mounts to no great height but spreads in comely manner, the
fruit is long in fashion of a soulsage, they will ripen though you first
plucke them in their greenesse, and become of a dainty yellow, the
rinde or skin peeles off most easily, the fruite then put into your
mouth, melts with mellow ripenesse, and giues a most delicious tast

they very orderly cut and pinke their skin of sundry formes

               <p>Their Marriages are rare and ceremonious, one same obserued

on the <hi>Bramini</hi> (or their Priests) who well performe it. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
these Idoll Priests are in such great esteeme among them, that it
is vsuall with them to enter the Kings house or any others, discourse
at pleasure with their females, and to vse (I might say abuse) them
with discretion. And note that at such time as the <hi>Bramini</hi> enters,
the good man of the house leaues him possession, ioying not a little,
that the holy (so reputed) man discends to teach and accompany
their wiues and daughters.</p>
               <p>When the King dies, they forbeare to crowne his sonne, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulate

dilacerate their eares to a monstrous proportion, for by the

The Gentry are stiled <hi>Nairos,</hi> are a valiant and well made
people, pleate their haire very decently, and their naked armes are
only clothed with Bracelets of siluer and juory, they neuer walke
the streets without Sword and Target, and if any vulgar fellow meet
them, they presently shake and vibrate their Swords vpon their
Shields, crying aloud <hi>Nayroe</hi> and so obtaine the way without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>

(whom they call <hi>Deumo</hi>) the Chappell where this Monster sits is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,
and in height about three yards. As they goe in, the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
entrance is ingrauen with hellish shapes. Within, their beloued
<hi>Deumo</hi> is imperiously inthronized vpon a brazen Mount. His head is
aduanced with a rich Diadem, from his head issue foure great hornes
(such as haue the Rams of <hi>Persia</hi>) his eyes gleering, mouth like a port
Cullis, beautified with foure tuskes, his nose vgly flat, his looke ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
hands like clawes, has Lions thighes and legs, and feet not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

glistering like Glowormes. Some of which are pictured deuouring
soules.</p>
               <p>Each morne the <hi>Braminy</hi> or Priest perfume and wash them, not
going away without crauing his malediction, humbly prostrate hee
requires it (and tis granted him.) For euery Moone they solemnely
bequeath a liuing Sacrifice vnto their <hi>Deumo,</hi> which vsually is a dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Cocke. The Priest in his Sacrifice is apparelled in fine Lawne,
and with a sharp siluer Knife, he nobly destroyes the yeelding Cock,
whose warme bloud is offered to the Deuill, the Sacrificers armes,
and legges are garnished with round siluer plates and other trifles,
which as he moues makes a gingling noyse. The Ceremony ended,
he fils his hands with Rice, and Crab-like goes retrograde from the
Idoll, all the way stedfastly fixing his eyes vpon his <hi>Deumo,</hi> when
being come to a Lake (like <hi>Acheron</hi>) there hee embowels his Rice,
therewith aduanceth his hands aboue his head, he returns and makes
himselfe heire vnto the Offerings.</p>
               <p>Nor sits the King to meate till such time as the <hi>Deumo</hi> has it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

returne it to the King, but what is left is giuen to the Crowes,

               <p>The people in way of mutuall loue and amity, vse to exchange
their wiues, with which the women seeme contented, and here Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligamy
is not forbidden; for as the men haue many Wiues, so haue
the women many Husbands. But the children are giuen to such the

               <p>It is an ordinary custome here to wash the body wholy euery
morne, that done they goe vnto the Idoll, where, with vnspeakable
ill-fauoured gestures, and writhing of their mouth and eyes, they
continue their inuocations wel-nigh an houre, which ceremony is so
hideously acted that it raises no small stupefaction in the beholders.</p>
               <p>This superstitious people frequently resort to the Citie of <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute,</hi>

               <p>Againe (O griefe to speake it) in these parts, the people are so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely
Idolatrous, and ouerswayed by the insatiable gulph of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

whose Statue is gloriously mounted vpon a Chariot which mooues
with eight mighty wheeles, ouerlaid with Gold, the ascent vp to the
Idoll vpon the Chariot is spacious and easie by many and enlarging
steps, on which sit with sober visage, the Priests and other little
Girles who in way of deuotion (impure sanctitie) prostiute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to the libidinous heat of wicked men, the better thereby to

Parents to destinate their prettie children, from their infancie, to
such an abominable libertie.)</p>
               <p>The story followes, when the Idoll goes on procession, the prime
men of the place assemble together, in company of many others to
draw the Chariot, happy is that man or child can lay a hand to help to
draw it. For in this his triumphant progresse, many men and women
(more forward then wise) throw themselues voluntarily in the
Chariots way, who by the ponderousnesse of the Idoll haue their
poore wretched bodies miserably crusht in pieces, thereby becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
vain-glorious Martyrs, but more vnhappy men.</p>
               <p>Yea more, such is the stupid folly of the men their in these parts,
by compelling their Virgins to become base prostitutes (their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

                  <hi>MAuritius</hi> is an Ile scituate within the burning Zone close by

doubtfull of what part of the three it is, of this I nothing doubt,
that for varietie of Gods temporall blessings, no part of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse

               <p>It first was discouered by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who (not vnlike a second
<hi>Adam,</hi> denominating all new places and things) gaue it the name of
<hi>Do-Cerne,</hi> by some <hi>Cygnaea,</hi> but since by the <hi>Hollanders, Mauritius;</hi>
either from the name of <hi>Graue Maurice,</hi> or more likely by the ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke
of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship cald the <hi>Mauritius,</hi> that laid her bones here,
dead through rottennesse.</p>
               <p>It is an Ile abounding with all good things requisite for mans vse,
and requireable for the Zone, tis placed in, the Land is high and
mountainous, chiefly where it beholds the Sea. The compasse or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit
of the Ile about a hundred miles. The greatest extent declining
from North-east to South-west: it procreates a healthy nourishing
aire, the flourishing fragrant trees, as well lenifying the burning
heate, when <hi>Phoebus</hi> embraces the Goate, as helped by the sweete
mollifying breath of the <hi>Noto-Zephirus,</hi> such time as <hi>Sol</hi> adheres to
<hi>Cancer:</hi> And as that body is best compounded that partakes indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
of all the Elements, which either super-abounding, or
wanting begets defect. So to be blest in all, this place is abortiue in
none.</p>
               <p>For water is here in plentie, nor is its goodnesse, and sweetnesse,
exceld by plenty, but as it gently drils it selfe from the high Rocks,
so it trickles downe the Valleyes, as it were besotted at the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
murmure it liueth in, and in some places spreads <hi>Meanders,</hi> till
too secure in his owne mildnesse, hee is ingulpht into the all-deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Ocean.</p>
               <p>It is abounding in diuers sorts of trees, which are as plentifull,
some good for timber, other for food, all for vse, here is store of box
trees, whose growth and greennesse, affoord profit and delight, here
is also great store of Ebony both blacke, red, white, and yellow, the
tree is outwardly couered with barque, but within digests her Ebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
the best is cole blacke, and good for Mathematicall Instruments,
playing Tables, Bowles, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And as it is plentifull in all things, so no one thing exceeds the
wood, which is in so great quantitie, that I could hardly procure
passage. But the most beneficiall tree to Trauellers is the Palmeto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
it growes like the Date or Coco-tree, saue that her boughes are
more large and round. The tree is long, straight and very soft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no leaues, boughes or branches, saue at the top<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are but
few, yet those good to couer Tents, or to shelter vs from the raines,
at the top whereof is a soft pith, in which consists the soule and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getatiue
vertue of that tree, which cut out, the tree expires, its taste is
like a good sweet Nuts kernell, and boyld like Cabbage, but the best
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:20350:112"/>
commoditie is the Wine issuing from the tree, which is sweet, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
and nourishing as Muskadine or Alligant, thus wee drinke it:
we come to a place where two or three trees grow together, and
with a Hatchet cut a small hole in euery tree, into which immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
effudes the liquour, so that suddenly all the holes I cut are full,
then with a cane or quill we sucke the Wine first out of one tree, and
then the other, and still one trees hole is full againe by that time we
had drunke out of the two other, thus in three trees in lesse then
one houre three of vs bowzed our bellies full. This Palmeto Wine,
is cold in digestion, purges the belly and helpes obstructions, and let
stand, in two dayes becomes good Vineger.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Againe, such is the life and pleasure of this <hi>Ambrosia,</hi> that (as I haue
noted) we were no sooner gone from the trees, though scarce three
yards, but diuers Birds as Parrats (which here are store of) Kites
and Lizards (of whom here be plenty, and those not a little curious)
would speed to sucke the distilling Nectar.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:20350:112"/>
Diuers other trees here be, strange both in shape and nature, one
out of curiositie I tasted of, which for halfe an houre so malignant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bit and wronged my mouth and lips, as if Vitrioll and Sulphur had
beene imbrued. This tree procreates nothing that is greene or good,
is wholy naked, without leafe or flowre, and the body very soft and
penetrable, in so much that I thinke a Mukset bullet would wel-nigh
pierce through a tree of fiue yards circuit, whose softnesse, one of
those inuited me to write my name in, which my Knife as easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
as with a sticke you may doe in sand.</p>
               <p>Another tree beares a codfull of sharpe prickles, wherein are hid
a round fruit like a Doues Egge, which broken has in it a kernell, in
taste, not vnlike an Acorne, but in digestion, if not the same, little
better then poyson.</p>
               <p>Other trees haue fruits like Pine-apples, like Arthichokes, like
Plummes, others like Nuts and Berries, but what vertue, the fruits
or names, or trees doe challenge, I must plead ignorance. This Job<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
that of these, what the Birds eat not, the Tortoyses doe, and
what they refuse, the Swine deuoure, so that by one or other all is
tasted of.</p>
               <p>And againe, as the Ile is prodigall in her water and wood, so shee
corresponds in what else a fruitfull mother labours to be excellent
in, not only boasting in that varietie of feathered creatures, but in
the rarenesse of that varietie, which if run ouer briefly, yet may be
thought too tedious, I feare by some on such a subiect.</p>
               <p>First, here and here only and in <hi>Dygarroys,</hi> is generated the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>

Flying Fish, Gar-fish, Rock-fish, Lympits, Sharkes, Pikes,

               <p>The Ile affoords vs withall Goats, Hogges, Beeues, and Kine,

Rats and Monkeyes, all which becomes food to such ships as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor

               <p>Though now for the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> forces, they dare not rest

               <p>The birds are so vnused to tyrannicke people, that I haue shot
one Heron in sixe, and kild them all one after another, the one not
knowing or valuing the others danger, but beget destruction to
themselues, by condoling their late dead associates.</p>
               <p>The like for the fish, only the Goats are wary and haue their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels.</p>
               <p>The Hens in eating taste like parched Pigs, if you see a flocke of

meate cannot be tasted of. They sqweake and call one the other, in

at the aspiring height of the adjacent mountaines, or proud in his

its motion. Yet this fury addes to the benefit of the earth, making it
sweete and mellow, which otherwise would shew too full of stones

who (to say truth) was the first and sure discouerer of those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
his Plantations and other Reasons proouing it, which I trust

               <p>And least any may thinke the person to whom wee attribute a
Trophee of so great honour subiect to inuention or not worth a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
I will first giue you a word of his Discent, with the occasion
of his honourable Voyage and so goe on.</p>
               <p>His name was <hi>Madoc</hi> brother of Prince <hi>Dauid,</hi> and sonne of that
famous <hi>Owen Gwyneth</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who for aboue thirty yeares
gouerned their with great wisdome, courage and good fortune: his
Father was that <hi>Gruffith ap Conan</hi> that did homage to <hi>William</hi> the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:20350:116"/>
Conquerour, at Saint <hi>Dauids</hi> for his Principallties in <hi>Wales,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, and lineally descended from King <hi>Rodri-mawr,</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericke</hi>
the Great, who in many conflicts beat the <hi>Saxons,</hi> especially
is renowned by those ouerthrowes he gaue <hi>Burchred</hi> King of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,
Athelwolfe</hi> King of the West <hi>Saxes,</hi> and <hi>Merick</hi> a valiant Prince
amongst them in foure seuerall Battailes at <hi>Gwerthen, Bangelu, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negid,</hi>
and <hi>Anglesea, Anno Dom.</hi> 846.</p>
               <p>Enough to satisfie the modest, touching the worth and value of
this <hi>Madoc,</hi> this added, that so soone as his Father Prince <hi>Owen</hi> was
dead, a great and implacable enmitie arose betweene <hi>Iorwerth</hi> (sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Drwyndwn,</hi> by reason of his broken nose) <hi>Howell</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi>
sonnes of <hi>Owen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iorwerth</hi> (or <hi>Edward)</hi> was thought vnworthy the Crowne and
dignitie both in respect of his deformity and simplenesse, <hi>Howell</hi> was
excluded by vote of the common short in that his mother was an <hi>Irish</hi>
woman, and <hi>Dauid</hi> though inferiour in yeares, yet by marriage of
<hi>Emma Plantaginet,</hi> sister to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, by generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
was judged worthiest, and secured himselfe not long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
by that victory he got against his opposite Brethren, wherein
<hi>Howell</hi> was slaine and <hi>Iorwerth</hi> escaped, by which Prince <hi>Dauid</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
secure, till <hi>Anno 1194. Llewellin ap Iorwerth</hi> recouered his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
right, helped by those actiue Gentlemen, <hi>Howell up Meredith</hi>
and <hi>Conan ap Own Guinedd,</hi> his neere Kinsmen.</p>
               <p>During which turmoiles and vnnaturall strifes, the said <hi>Madoc</hi>
loath to be an Agent of Discord to either party, and seeing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of peace ineffectuall, studies by all good meanes to auoid the
knowledge of it, and aymes at some forren place of ease and profit,
neither discouraged by improbabilities nor likely disasters.</p>
               <p>These (no doubt) were causes mouing Prince <hi>Madoc</hi> to this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicke
Employment, added by those foretelling Southsayes, before
named, and which without question were knowne vnto this <hi>Madoc,</hi>
who according to his dignitie was instructed, in seuerall sorts of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and learning. And it may be hee called to minde that Prophetique
Song made by that honorable <hi>Bardh</hi> or Poet <hi>Ambrose Teleyssen,</hi> who
flourished in the time of <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius,</hi> brother to <hi>Vther-pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragon,</hi>
called hither out of <hi>Armorica,</hi> by the distressed <hi>Brittaines,</hi> to
reuenge them vpon the vnciuill <hi>Saxons</hi> in the yeare 490. after
Christ. <hi>Teyleyssen</hi> in that Song first reprooues the Clergie of Auarice,
Pride, and Superstition (though they boasted of a conuersion made
awhiles before by <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monke sent to that end by <hi>Gregorit</hi>
the Great.)</p>
               <p>It seemes ignorant that long before, our Countrimen had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
Christ by the preaching of <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and <hi>Zelotes</hi>
in this manner.</p>

and such as take pleasure in sophistry and opposition.</p>
               <p>This, no doubt, had it beene so faithfully knowne and belieued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
forreigne and moderne Writers as is merited, then <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
Columbus</hi> (a man in truth worthy and industrious) <hi>Americus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spucius,
Magellan,</hi> and many others had not wholy carried along

Prince <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Madoc</hi> beene defrauded of their claime into those
Countries, nor had the Pope nor <hi>Spaniard</hi> had that immediate inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
grounded vpon their first Discouery as very many Iesuits and
Statists haue late disputed for.</p>
               <p>We allow no lesse (I dare say more) honour to <hi>Columbus</hi> then
they or any other can, but this withall. That this his Nauigation suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>Madoc ap Owens,</hi> three hundred two and twenty yeares,
and the aduantage is this, hee prosecuted his intents in a happier
Age, and when the World was more addicted to forreigne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:20350:118"/>
and abler by Nauigation to attaine with lesse perill, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>
                  <hi>Columbus</hi> was borne in <hi>Cugureo,</hi> not farre from <hi>Genoa,</hi> a man both
modest and expert in Sea affaires, his helpes left him by a Pilot dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his house, soone after his returne from those parts forced thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by storme and destinie, and comparing those proofes with the
coniectures of ancient and graue Philosophers, and it may be not
wholy ignorant of <hi>Madocs</hi> former being there (for what Nation for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

many vntruths and coniecturall testimonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Columbus</hi> armed with hopes and some assurances repaires to some
Christian Princes for his vndertakers, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seuenth lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
money too well, and obseruing simplicitie, in the Messingers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery
and lookes (who vnfortunately had beene detained prisoner
by some Rascals in his passage hither) denied him so that immediatly
vpon the Kings refusall and the <hi>French</hi> Kings, his brother by that
time had drawne on King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> (though first against it, hauing
his hands full, ere he could vtterly expell the <hi>Saracens,</hi> too long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them) so that vpon the commends of <hi>Iohn Perez de Marchena,</hi>
Rector of the Monastery of <hi>Rabida, Colon</hi> was trusted with two small
ships and two hundred men.</p>
               <p>With which after sixtie dayes sayle after much patience, and no
lesse adoe to quiet the discontented <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they descried land in
some part of <hi>Mexico.</hi> Infinitely ioying himselfe and them, and by
this good lucke deriuing no lesse Gold vnto the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> than all
<hi>Europe</hi> enioyed formerly, but how meanly this worthy man was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that rewarded, I leaue it to the Reader to satisfie himselfe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Writings concerning it.</p>
               <p>Not long after <hi>Americus Vespucius</hi> (before his Orientall Nauigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
aduances Southerly, where with small toyle hee found land e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
(but part of that Continent formerly discouered) to glut am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
howbeit iudging his labours more excellent then the others,
he denominates that vast &amp; spacious Continent from his owne name,
<hi>America,</hi> iniuriously assumed and vnwisely giuen him by other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
being that others had the glory of first finding it, and might
more iustly haue called it <hi>Madocya, Brittania, Colonia,</hi> or <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But wee see by generall assent <hi>Americus</hi> has got the honour of it,
and thriues better (tho deseruing equally) then <hi>Bathillus</hi> the Poeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
who thought to haue defrauded <hi>Virgill</hi> of his elaborate Poem,
and there want not some (yet those not enuious) that wish his reward
agreeable.</p>

                  <hi>Magellan</hi> soone after sailes yet more South, and passes that <hi>Fretum</hi>
or strait, with more reason called <hi>Magellan,</hi> a hundred others haue
since that gleaned seuerall additions of Titles and new names their
distributed.</p>
               <p>Only he that in truth most of all deserued it, <hi>Madoc,</hi> sleepes, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
of quiet more then vain-glory, yet those that loue his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
will not passe by such liuing Monuments of his deseruings (my
owne case at this present) without some small testimonie of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and zeale to worth and equitie, and leaue it to a better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
in a better method, to reuiue him clearlier.</p>
               <p>I will lead you through no more extrauagancies, lest your entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

am no lesse desirous of home (tyred in a double Trauaile, by scor-Zones

detract from better Notions.)</p>
               <p>On the last of <hi>Nouember,</hi> after much strugling with contrary
windes and some tempests, we got sight of the <hi>Azores</hi> knowne by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
names, as the Westerne or Flemmish Ilands. In their Origine
knowne best to <hi>Flemmings,</hi> though now subiect to a higher com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
the Imperious <hi>Portugall.</hi> They are nine in number, of which
<hi>Tercaera</hi> is (if not greatest) most famous for a defensiue Warre the
<hi>Prior Don Antonio,</hi> Titularie King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> made there against
the insatiate and inuading <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who finally got that and the rest
of <hi>Don Antonioes</hi> territories claymed by right of bloud and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
as the Historian <hi>Cunestagio</hi> in his vnion of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
treateth of.</p>
               <p>They are abounding, with no rich Commodities, their victuall is
small, Wine bad, and water not very excellent. They affoord
much Oade, which has made them most famous and best inriched
them.</p>
               <p>This added, that the old account of the first Meridian is transferd
hither from the <hi>Canaries,</hi> or Iles once Fortunate, for twixt <hi>Flores</hi>
and <hi>Coruo,</hi> the Needle finds no Variation, elsewhere saue in that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
increasing.</p>
               <p>The other seuen are these, Saint <hi>George,</hi> Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> Saint <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Fayall, Pyco, Gratiosa,</hi> and <hi>Tercaera.</hi> Some of which I here
tho vn-usefully demonstrate.</p>

               <p>Leauing these, wee entred the <hi>Spanish</hi> or <hi>Cantabrian</hi> Ocean, where
thinking our selues past all danger (such ioy the sight of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
World and affinitie with our owne Country enricht vs with)
when loe to shew there is no constancie nor trust in incertaine Seas
and terrene pleasures, an horred three dayes continued tempest (not
without much feare and doubt) threw vs vpon <hi>Vshents</hi> point in <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany</hi>
(a marittime part of <hi>France)</hi> and immediately againe, when we
expected most danger, the weather fauoured vs, and with a smiling
gale affoorded vs in few watches, sight of our long-lookt-for <hi>Ithaca:</hi>
And the more desired, that these Relations might find acceptance
from that most noble Lord the Earle of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> Lord Steward
(now with God) &amp; my Lord of <hi>Powys,</hi> from whose encouragements
I affected Trauaile: which I cannot passe by without acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>To conclude, wee came safe to an anchor in <hi>Plymouth</hi> Hauen,
where (not without great cause) wee gaue God hearty
thankes, for his former mercies and our
present safeties.</p>
